If you somehow ignore the sequences with Robert Vaughn (not a terribly convincing villian) and Richard Pryor (funny, but  not appropriate for a Superman movie), the rest makes for a top-notch  movie, i.e., Superman rescuing the chemical plant; the almost-love story  between Lana Lang and Clark Kent; and the ""evil"" and then  ""split"" Superman.

288397,5,6300270122,"This  movie  is  very  interesting,  it  is  one  that  will  catch  our  eyes  or  anyone's  eyes.
Clark Kent  will  face  his  greatest  quest  ever,  after  being  exposed  by  a  green  crystal  duplicated  by  Gus (Richard Pryor)  &  his  boss  Ross Webster  (Robert Vaughn)  after  they  found  a  piece  of  debris  left  behind  after  Krypton  exploded.  It  starts  changing  Superman  as  quick  as  Gus  gives  it  to  him  gradually.  Nobody  suspected  anything  strange  about  it. He  first  becomes  forgetful  not  taking  stuff  as  seriously  as  he  normally  would.  &  non caring  &  then  mean.  Lana  &  little  Ricky  didn't  notice  anything.  His  only  weakness  was  from  a  kid  named  Ricky  giving  him  a  confident  feeling,  where  Clark Kent  appears  to  confront  the  Evil  man  of  steel  there  in  the  junkyard.  He  was  either  going  to  stay  bad  or  he  wasn't. He  goes  after  the  ones  he  sensed  did  that  to  him.
I  liked  the  beginning  of  the  movie.  It  starts  off  comedy  related,  considering  the  everyday  non  serious  things.  A  bunch  of  silly  &  small  things  happen,  a  blind  man  temporarily  losing  his  eye  seeing  dog  &  mistakes  the  stripe  painter  for  the  streets  for  his  dog,  One  getting  a  pie  in  his  face  &  feeling  like,  Oh  man  this  just  isn't  my  day,  Another  gets  a  paint  bucket  dropped  on  his  head.  You  name  it!  If  I  didn't  know  better  I'd  say  the  producers  of  the  script  in  this  movie  wanted  us  to  gain  a  little  laughter.  That  part  of  the  movie  is  a  good  start  for  good  humor!  Superman  must  however  rescue  a  man  trapped  inside  of  his  car  while  the  cab  is  filling  with  water.
This  ones  about  Gus  &  him  becoming  a  computer  expert.  I  wish  I  could  do  that,  do  what  he  did  put  in  a  voucher  for  expenses  then  get  a  check  for  85'000$.  From  there  Gus  makes  a  deal  with  his  boss  MR  Webster.  He  had  been  looking  for  someone  to  make  computers,  his  computers  do  what  they're  not  supposed  to  do,  &  he  feels  like  he's  found  the  perfect  individual  for  that.
He  manages  to  change  the  weather  in  South America,  as  well  as  the  traffic  lights.  That  was  funny.  Stuff  in  this  movie  is  unusual.
Ross  Webster  takes  care  of  his  issue  with  Columbia,  &  thanks  to  Gus Gorman,  he  says  to  MR Webster  &  the  2  girls  We  got  a  problem  with  Superman.  Richard Pryor's  performance  is  very  funny. Once  taken  care  of  Superman,  He  tries  possessing  the  oil  tankers.
MR Ross Webster's  place  is  fancy,  I  guess  he  must  own  that  building  where  Gus  works.  He's  got  his  own  ski  slope.  Says  he  was  born  rich.  Gus  pulls  out  blueprints  for  the  ultimate computer  which  will  do  everything  a  normal  computer  can  do  &  1000  things  none  of  them  can  do!  Which  would  serve  as  a  backup  plan  if  the  situation  with  the  Kryptonite  turning  Superman  bad  fails.  They  did  have  Superman  at  his  mercy  for  a  little  while.  Up  until  Gus takes  out  a  red  screw  which  I  think  causes  a  severe  malfunction.  The  computer  now  has  a  mind  of  its  own!  &  can  seize  people  &  turn  them  into  robots.  Which  is  what  happened  to  Vera Webster. That  was  a  little  scary  watching  her  face  get  covered  in  less  than  a  minute. Known  as  Cyborgs,  When  Superman  returns  to  destroy  the  machine,  It  had  already  tried  to  turn  him  into  a  cyborg  as  well.  But  he  proved  to  be  too  tough! Then  after  the  computer  is  destroyed  she's  changed  back  into  an  ordinary  normal  human  being.  You'd  think  after  that  she'd  have  amnesia  or  something.  But  she  appeared  to  be  fine.  Ross  Webster  to  me  should  have  been  the  one  to  get  turned  into  a  cyborg  instead  of  his  sister!  Earlier  on  before  the  machine  malfunctioned  Ross  plays  a  game  similar  to  Atari,  none  of  those  rockets  had  any  effect  on  superman.  When  they  exploded  they  really  needed  to  effect  superman  with  Kryptonite!  Superman  rescues  Gus  &  flies  him  back  to  civilization.  Clark  Kent  is  also  spending  time  with  Lana  his  friend  from  highschool,  who  at  the  same  time  is  trying  to  find  a  way  to  get  away  from  Brad  so  she  doesn't  always  feel  pestered  by  him.
Good  Movie!  A  lot  of  it  what  happens  in  the  movie  is  make  believe.
Superman  3  has  been  a  movie  I've  enjoyed  for  a  long  time!  &  is  my  favorite  Superman  movie  out  of  all  4  of  them!  Like  nothing  I've  ever  seen  before!",1438128000,,4757,4.3514588859416445
288398,3,6300270122,"Despite this being my first time going through the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, I am keenly aware of the general public attitude toward them. So, I knowingly lowered my expectations for this third entry in the series. Even with those lowered expectations, I still wasn't prepared for how insipidly stupid it would be. Yes, there was plenty of Superman action. Yes, the special effects were as good as ever. The acting was fine. But the story? Oh my god! Richard Lester was merely a hired gun on SUPERMAN II, due to Richard Donner being fired. Here he was in charge the whole time, and the sillier aspects of that film were given too much free reign here.

The plot this time around is certainly one of the weakest aspects of the whole film. In short, an evil corporation that has ambitions for economic domination taints Superman with synthetic kryptonite (laced with tobacco tar), and this splits him into evil Superman and good Clark Kent. All of the best parts of the first two films are either shoved to the side or left out entirely. This means hardly any Daily Planet, and Lex Luthor is nowhere to be found. The replacement just doesn't compare favorably, no matter how much I didn't like Lex Luthor's characterization before. That being said, Superman having an identity crisis was an intriguing idea, but the way it's executed is so hamfistedly literal that it kills whatever impact it could have had.

However, in the interest of not coming off like I absolutely hated the film, I will say that the technical aspects of the film were really good. All of the special effects were handled well, and the flying sequences were deftly handled, even if it's fairly apparent now how they were achieved (front projection). I also thought the cinematography was excellent, with a number of beautiful shots of landscapes and scenery. As previously stated, the acting was fine. In the TV special on the making of SUPERMAN II, Christpher Reeve talked about how he preferred playing Clark Kent because he was more relatable as a person. Here, the plot allowed for him to explore a darker side to Superman's personality, which I'm certain he had a hand in seeing as he's the film's star and it probably gets tiresome playing the same character over and over again. That one aspect of the plot is something I'll give the writers kudos for. If only they (and the director) hadn't made the film so silly...

What's wrong with the film is nearly everything else. Richard Pryor plays an opportunistic con man and computer genius (who discovers his talent in a computer programming course). There is absolutely nothing wrong with Richard Pryor. I quite like his standup act. However, he seemed extremely out of place here. In general, the silly tone just rubbed me the wrong way and there was too much reliance on slapstick for laughs. A perfect example of this is the opening scene which just went on far too long. At some point, it felt like I was watching a Keystone Kops movie than a Superman film. Beyond that, some elements of the story were nonsensical and just plain stupid. First of all, is this the same Clark Kent/Superman who reversed time to save Lois Lane and gave up his power to be with her (temporarily, at least)? If so, then why does he go back to Smallville and almost immediately hook up with childhood friend Lana Lang? Also, compared to the villains' schemes in the previous two films, the plot to turn Superman into a jerk (so that they can dominate the coffee industry?) seems like a step back. Not only that, but they bungle the one clever plot element by having Superman literally fight Clark Kent, and then having the ""evil"" side just disappear when Clark Kent puts a choke hold on him. And when you think about it, kryptonite is pretty stupid as it is. I could go on, but hopefully I've made my point.

Overall, SUPERMAN III feels like a huge step back in storytelling when compared to the previous two, which I didn't exactly love to begin with. Entertaining? Yes, in some respects, but this one was borderline painful to watch. The idiocy displayed on screen was barely tolerable. Richard Lester was allowed to indulge in his slapstick tendencies to a degree which wasn't possible in SUPERMAN II (since he had to use stuff that Richard Donner shot), and the result was rather unflattering. Having watched nine of the original Superman cartoon shorts, at times this felt like a return to that style, which I was not a fan of. I'll give the filmmakers credit for making a visually appealing film that displays some technical prowess. I also still get goosebumps when I hear John Williams' iconic theme. But literally everything else works against that to make an unfortunately sub-par film.",1434585600,,4714,4.738124238733252

288400,2,6300270122,"I can't stress how much I miss Richard Donner. He wanted this series to be ""epic"" and have a feel of the comic books. His glorious first 2 films (yes he directed both contrary to what most people think). He filmed nearly 75 of Superman 2 then he got Axed.

But back to 3. While a stand alone movie, Superman 3 is is not terrible, but if it hadn't have been for Christopher Reeve playing his lead role, the movie would have been a total disappointment. The movie has some decent moments throughout, especially when Chris is on screen, but he's not on the screen enough and the comedic elements with Richard Pryor, just didn't turn out well, even though I'm personally a Richard Pryor fan. Annette O Toole and Christopher Reeve have a remarkable chemistry on-screen, I just wish they would have taken the chemistry farther with the story. But the movie goes to stupidity concerning a robot that is going ot destroy the planet. The special effects, while I've seen worse, were just okay and that robot finale was just hard to like. The other actors who were the bad guys, just were terrible and I hated every moment they were on screen.  The magic of Margot Kidder from the first two films was also sorely missing, she was only on-screen for maybe a total of 5 minutes.

The epic stories of 1 and 2 are just a distant memory when you watch 3, and they dont' feel connected at all, in fact, when Superman Returns was made, Singer made sure his movie had nothing to do with 3 or 4 which he also considered terrible. 3 is watchable, but barely. Christopher Reeve shines as usual on screen, but the writing, the sense of scale and the other actors, it just barely suffices.",1431475200,,1666,4.4557377049180324

Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) cant get a break, so he decides to go back to school and become a computer programmer. Finding out he has a genius-like knack for telling computers what to do, he quickly tries to make himself rich by doing so. After getting caught, the business tycoon he tried to rip off hires Gus to use computers to make him rich, namely by building a machine that can control the weather and cause different natural disasters which would in turn benefit the company. The plans are foiled when Superman (Christopher Reeve) steps in and saves the day. Now with the Man of Steel in their sights, Webster uses Guss computer know-how to take down the Last Son of Krypton once and for all by synthesizing the one thing that can hurt him: Kryptonite.

Except, because of a slight alteration to the formula, Gus and Webster get something else: a changed Superman, one bent on evil instead of good.

Can the Man of Steel be restored before Webster has taken over the globe?

What can I say about this movie? Its a hard movie to judge because it was such a drastic shift in tone from the previous Superman flicks that on the one hand, you look at it as a continuation of the othersand it fails miserablybut on the other, you see it for what it is and its pretty good.

Let me explain.

As strictly a superhero movie, its silly. It was written as a comedyprobably to make Richard Pryor shine, who was a massive comedic star in the 80sand thats where its downfall was. While Christopher Reeve played Superman straight like he always does, it didn't really mesh with the rest of the movie and as a result its hard to take it seriously.

However, Mr. Reeve is stacked as Superman in this flick. Physique-wise, he totally peaked with Superman III and was even more powerful-looking than in the other films. I wish this presentation of Superman muscle-wise was in all of them. The super feats are great, you cheer him on, and your inner fanboy squeals with glee every time.

Storywise, some might call it silly. I call it: okay for the time. In general, the idea of a computer genius trying to take out the Man of Steel is a fine idea. Put him up against some tech-based problems and you could have a good movie. But this was the early 1980s and movie special effects were nowhere near what they are today and the budget wasn't there to put Superman up against some really strong computer-or-robot-based foe, so we settled for manufactured weather disasters and a super computer and woman-turned-robot at the end. Bummer. (But as a kid, the robo version of Vera (Annie Ross) scared me big time.)

From looking at it as a comedy, its great. Pure gold. Richard Pryor wasn't called a comedic genius for nothing. Everything from his mannerisms to facial expressions to punch line delivery shines in this flick. The jokes are smart, sometimes slapstick and sometimes incredibly subtle, but always funny.

This movie would never go over well with audiences today and at a superficial glance, I can see why, but if you take the time to really look at it and appreciate it for what it is, it is a good movie.",1427673600,,3113,4.532976827094474

288436,3,6300270122,"It's too bad that this film is chalked with bad acting and corny lines because the premise of Superman 3 is absolutely superb and the themes that this film deals with are more pertinent today than ever before.  Especially is this the case with the character that Robert Vaughn so brilliantly played.  He played a role that was very reminiscent of billionaire George Soros who happens today to be one of the global kingpins, along with the Rockefellers and the Morgans who, basically are the masterminds of what many have come to know as the New World Order.  And what is really striking about this film is that they sure got it right with the scene where Robert Vaughn orders a satelite to change the weather and cause storms that wipe out the entire coffee crop in a South American country, thus destroying their economy while the character that Vaughn plays sits back fat and happy that he was the mastermind of this sadistic plot.  And if anybody thinks that this is pure science fiction, then I highly recommend people research HAARP here on Amazon and on the rest of the Internet.  The facts will speak for themselves as they show that this is real and not some tinfoil hat conspiracy tripe.
What I would suggest to the directors and producers of the movie Man Of Steel is that they have the sequel be about how Superman takes on the New World Order, Illuinati, and all the other creeps that are messing up this planet and the people on it.  I think that this would do quite well in light of the fact that more and more people are finding out about these bozos who are really controlling this world.

Anyway, altthough Superman 3 is not nearly the masterpiece that its predecessors were, the film is worth taking a look at to see all these themes about world domination that are brought out and one of Robert Vaughn's most finest performances a villian ever to hit the silver screen.",1416787200,,1888,4.551622418879056

288442,2,6300270122,"Superman III is the third installment of the Superman films that stars Christopher Reeve. In it,the film departs from the first two films in the sense that it becomes primarily a slapstick comedy and it becomes more interested in eliciting laughter from the viewers rather than providing an exploration of the complexities of the characterizations of the people in the story particularly Clark Kent and Superman himself. It capitalizes on the presence of comedic actor,Richard Pryor,who portrays Gus Gorman,the villain whom Superman is up against in this film.

It was not good that the third film somewhat downgrades from the quality that the first two films - Superman The Movie and Superman II - provided when it turned out to be more of a slapstick comedy. Aside from the presence of Pryor,Robert Vaughn's portrayal of another villain in Ross Webster, were uninspired fill in for Lex Luthor nor The Supervillains in Superman The Movie and Superman II respectively. Too bad that director Richard Lester went into another direction for the franchise after replacing Richard Donner in the second film. Without Donner, the Superman films just went on a decline in terms of the direction it is headed since this film. It is also worthy to note that the absence of Gene Hackman and the near-absence of Margot Kidder,who was limited to 5 minutes of screen time for expressing her disgust on the firing of Donner,proved disastrous as well. Obviously,the love story between Lana Lang and Clark Kent was never able to fill in for the romance between Lois Lane and Superman/Clark Kent.

The only good thing about it is the performance of Christopher Reeve,who proved himself to be have great acting skills when portraying the good and evil Superman. Nothing more. Unfortunately,that isn't enough to save it from a disaster just like Pryor's presence.",1408320000,,1843,5.059210526315789

288487,4,6300270122,"Sure, it looks like Richard Pryor never brought his comedic talent to the set, but this wasn't that bad a film...it was certainly a huge step up from what Superman IV was to become.  I wasn't quite sure about having a billionaire villain in this film, but that may be because I'm so accustomed to the billionaire version of Lex Luthor from the 1990s Superman animated series and the live-action series Smallville.  If Luthor wasn't going to be in this film, I'd have liked to see another iconic Superman villain in that slot...Lord knows there are plenty to choose from.  But despite having a completely new villain and his sister, both of whom seemed somewhat hastily put together, their scheme was interesting, especially if you consider how different computers were back when this film came out in the 1980s.  The corrupt Superman was a sight I don't remember ever seeing before (maybe I missed those episodes of Smallville) and it was quite something to see...the filmmakers could have made that campy but they didn't...good job!  Clark Kent's new love interest, Lana Lang, played by Annette O'Toole, was also interesting, even if she was only added because Margot Kidder was unhappy about director Richard Donner's firing and had her role as Lois Lane reduced to twelve lines as a result.  Lana Lang wasn't simply another damsel in distress for Superman to save and instead served as a good friend to Clark, getting his support in return.  It was like Lois Lane being developed all over again.  It'd have been interesting to see where her character went in the next sequel...but it seemed Margot Kidder and the producers resolved their differences by then.  Anyway, this was a decent film that, while going the way of bad sequels, hung in there and still turned out a fair plot with some great acting.  Enjoy.",1401494400,,1814,4.82258064516129

288489,3,6300270122,"Say what you will about ""Superman III"" and about how ""awful"" it supposedly is, but nobody else has come even close, in my opinion, to making a truly ""good"" or even just plain ""satisfactory"" full-length live-action adventure featuring the Last Son of Krypton... perhaps with the exception of the pre-TV George Reeves feature film, ""Superman and the Mole Men,"" which was in actuality shot as a ""test pilot"" for the television program, so even this in the most technical sense does not truly count.

Apart from his appearances in DCAU animation offerings (none of which having ever made it to the ""Big Screen""), NO ONE has yet figured out how to translate Superman to the feature-length film format... and make no mistake, ""Superman III"" is no exception in this. However, in light of all of the mishandlng that has been done of this character for the purposes of presenting him to movie-going audiences, ""III"" stands as the best we have to select from... and that's sad!

Yes, the other entries are more ""action packed"" and ""grittier,"" but they all to the letter treat the legend as a joke! The thing about ""Superman III"" is that the filmmakers here have dispensed with all the pretense and have ACKNOWLEDGED the joke and treat it as such, and in so doing they actually managed to give this movie more of a ""comic book"" feel for the time and made it feel (dare I say it) ""familiar.""

But let's be clear, I still want to see an AWESOME full-lenth live-action rendition of the Superman character and mythos, but I want something more *INTELLIGENT* and involving in its handling (would somebody *PLEASE* take cues from DCAU DtDVD projects or ""Smallville""), rather than the vacuous pap we've been forced to swallow thus far. In the meantime, while all the big shot producers with no love for (or knowledge of) the character continue to try to figure out how to handle him and his world properly, I can take comfort that there's still this one stand-out entry that, while far from what it should be, I can actually watch not only with a smile but also find a deep and emotionally moving ""plot-driven"" story that makes me feel like maybe they were trying to lay the ground work, albeit in a lighthearted way, to make the telling of Superman's adventures more engaging and engrossing.",1398902400,2,2274,4.722921914357682

288534,4,6300270122,"***This review may contain spoilers***

After the stirring triumph of ""Superman - The Movie"" and ""Superman II"", a majority of people considered ""Superman III"" a bafflingly ignoble and comically disgraceful disappointment.  At the time over 30 years ago, I was no exception.  But yesterday afternoon on February 5, 2014 at about two-thirtieish P.M. I decided to watch ""Superman III"" on HBO to see if my opinion changed, especially since I had forgotten some movie scenes.  You know, ""Superman"" III was much more palatable and enjoyable the second time, even though its overindulgence in slapstick and pratfalls keeps it from occupying the lofty perch of the first two Superman movies.

""Superman III"" is preoccupied with the insidious threat of technology and computers, and tycoon Ross Webster's (Robert Vaughn)'s insatiable desire to exploit them, with the somewhat reluctant help of unexpected computer whiz Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor), to become still wealthier.  Of course, only Superman (Christopher Reeve) can thwart this ambitiously global plan.  However, three events complicate matters.  One is the kindling of an unexpected romance (as Clark Kent) with Smallville High School prom queen Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) at their high school reunion.  A second, minor one is uncouth former high school football hero Brad Wilson (Gavan O'Herlihy), Lana's jealous ex-beau.  The third and most formidable event is artificial, impure green kryptonite.  Manufactured at Webster's bidding by Gus to kill Superman and thus stop his interference, instead it unleashes his darker, selfish impulses.  Can Superman overcome these obstacles, plus a gigantic (and possibly sentient) supercomputer designed by Gus for out-and-out world domination?

As I mentioned, ""Superman III"" goes overboard a bit with the physical comedy (and Pryor's hapless blundering and improvisational schtick as Gus) and seems poised to trivialize the kryptonian superhero.  But Reeve, as both Kent and Superman, maintain things on a dignified but touching keel, handling sweet romance, outrageous disasters, and planetary threats with a nimble mixture of seriousness and self-deprecation.  In other words, Superman never becomes a joke.  Even when the ersatz kryptonite and the pleas of Lana's son Ricky force Superman to confront his malicious Hyde-like alter ego in an externalized, knockdown, junkyard battle for his soul, it somehow rises above absurdity to a gripping psychological revelation: even a Superman has his demons.  Furthermore, Superman atones for his misdeeds (not really so much felonies as mischievous misdemeanors) like pushing the Tower of Pisa back to leaning position.  Furthermore, besides the supercomputer, ""Superman III"" has its share of disasters for Superman to tackle, like an explosive chemical plant fire, tornado, missile assault, and female cyborg.

Perhaps the only true flaw in ""Superman III"" is its position in the series.  Maybe it should have been the second one, since the first movie does have its comedic pleasures and was just beginning to test Superman and ""Superman III"" could have been a more logical extension of the first, leading to a crescendo to ""Superman II"" where Superman's powers were tested to the limit.  Entertaining as Richard Vaughn's greedy CEO was, it might have been better to retain Lex Luthor in the corporate role to keep the continuity going and employ a delectable teaming of Gene Hackman and Richard Pryor.  While I'm making ""Monday morning quarterback"" suggestions, perhaps Brainiac and red kryptonite (which has unpredictable effects on Superman) could have found their way into the plot.  It's just speculation.

The simple point is is that ""Superman III"" is not quite ridiculous as it seems, mainly because Reeve believes in both his Clark Kent and Superman personas and helps both personas reasonably rise above the outlandish doings.",1391644800,,3876,5.47563025210084
288535,1,6300270122,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some extremely quick thoughts on this 1983 disaster...

Superman III (1983) is a useless comedy that stars Richard Pryor with special guest star Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman.  If you want to see a Superman movie that is just plain stupid and all wrong in every way, then see this.  Really nothing more needs to be said.  I told you I had some extremely quick thoughts!

NOT recommended.",1389916800,2,461,4.772151898734177
288536,4,6300270122,"While the first two Superman movies were genre-defining for Superman on film, and the fourth movie was a bad attempt to recreate that, Superman III is a completely different animal, in that Superman is a secondary character.

This movie isn't about Superman, it's a Richard Pryor who's a chronically unemployed sad sack with a knack for computers who falls into ever more absurd situation surrounding weather control and the world's coffee market. The overall world vision is very much in keeping with other Richard Pryor vehicles of the time, and the opening segment of little accidents snowballing on the streets of Metropolis, while bizarre for a Superman film, makes total sense in a Richard Pryor movie.

It makes very little sense for this movie to take place in the same world where a couple of years prior (Superman II) three alien supervillains took over the planet and named Lex Luthor ruler of Australia. It makes total sense for this movie to be the same world with Stir Crazy. This is a world where a boss feels totally justified in asking a recently hired computer programmer to kill a nigh-immortal superhero, and to get mad at him when he fails.

If you think about it, Superman didn't even need to be in this movie. You could've taken Gene Wilder, dressed him up as some ridiculous random super hero, and the whole narrative works exactly the same. Calling it Superman III is just confusing, and if you went into this expecting a movie about Superman, you probably ended up very disappointed.

On the other hand, this is a good Richard Pryor movie, with lots of opportunities for him to be silly and entertaining, and taken for what it is, it's a lot of fun.",1384128000,,1675,4.726027397260274
288537,5,6300270122,"I've seen all the Superman movies many times, and I just watched this one again with my kids over the weekend. While watching, I was struck by how ""not bad"" it is. I am a little annoyed that this movie gets so much hate by the critics. I mean, the first two movies were great but this one is good in its own right.

The addition of Richard Pryor as Gus Gorman at first comes off as rather odd. But once the movie picks up, he becomes a decent character.

People bemoan the lack of Lois in this movie. Personally, I feel that the whole Clark/Lois/Superman love triangle thing was explored to the fullest in the first two movies. It had been played out enough, and I was happy that the movie took things in a different direction.

And sure, we get a Lex-like supervillain, but Robert Vaughn as Ross Webster is great in his own right. He says a couple of lines in particular that crack me up every time I watch this!

- ""Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.""

- ""I ask you to kill Superman, and you're telling me you couldn't even do that one, simple thing.""

Yeah, the movie has some goofy, slapstick humor. Personally, I wasn't too interested in that. But you know what? My kids were laughing their heads off. So it was a good time for them, which makes me happy. Even if it doesn't take Superman as *seriously* as some fans would prefer.

There are plenty of serious moments, however. Clark's character grew in its own way, with his renewed relationship with Lana. The return to Smallville was a good personal and human part of the story.

I liked the villains. I thought they had good chemistry. And I thought the psuedo-kryptonite was a really neat story. Seeing Superman go bad was one of the best parts of the movie. And when he fights himself, that is one of the best scenes in all the movies. I truly enjoyed that. It worked on several levels.

The supercomputer at the end was a scary opponent to me. I remember as a kid being seriously creeped out by Vera being turned into a cyborg. That was just freaky! It still scares the crap out of me even now that I'm old, haha... And I like how Superman defeated the computer using his brains, not just muscle.

It was a good movie. It isn't perfect, but doesn't deserve all the criticism it gets. I enjoy watching movies like this because they are so different from the loud, explosion-filled summer spectacles that we get treated to nowadays. No thanks. Even with its shortcomings, Superman 3 still has a lot of heart.",1380499200,2,2478,4.402625820568928
288538,4,6300270122,"Superman III is probably my personal favorite of the series. It is goofy and cartoon-ish, but manages to have a pretty creepy idea for a story.

288539,5,6300270122,"Evil superman makes this one worth it. The movie does have camp which isn't funny to me. People banging into things is just corny. Even when I was young I didn't laugh at this. But, it does have Chris Reeve in it and he was well into the Superman role at this point. Sup 3 is a guilty pleasure for me. It's a different film than the first 2 movies, no Fortress Of Solitude, no crystals, little magic, no Krypton...and so on. But it does include kryptonite and some other interesting scenes. It's more of an episode in the series and has a cult status in my eyes. I watched it often when I was little on vhs so I will always have a soft spot for it in my heart. The DVD features are awesome too, decent commentary, old doc from 1983 and some forgettable deleted scenes. Still, it's nice they added these bonus items to the DVD.",1376438400,,826,4.20125786163522

That being said, here are the reasons I like this movie. When Superman fights his dark self, it's as close as we've gotten to a Superman/Bizarro fight on the big screen... So far. I enjoyed how the synthetic Kryptonite is made with chemicals from cigarettes . Very politically incorrect! And funny. Christoper Reeve never looked better as Superman. He was pretty buff for this flick and he looked good in the costume that hadn't really changed much since the 1940's. I kind of resent how DC thought they had to modernize the suit . Even in Superman Returns (which I like) they darkened the red on his costume and made his S more of a plaque on his chest rather than the logo being sewn into his shirt. They completely removed the yellow logo from his cape as they have in Man of Steel. I'm a traditionalist with my Superman and his comic book roots so I enjoy the bright reds and blues. Superman shouldn't be a dark character and he's not in this movie. Robert Vaghn(who to my knowledge is the last surviving member of the Magnificent Seven) is good as the Luthor substitute villain and I like Richard Pryor and congratulate the makers of this movie for going in a different direction. I love the Richard Donner stuff, but this is not his movie . Superman/Clark returns to Smallville which is nice in that you get to see him at his class reunion and reunite with Lana Lang . It's really too bad that they couldn't figure out a way to fit Krypto into this series of movies, but now I'm rambling. I have the Deluxe edition of this movie and it's cheap enough now that you won't be spending a ton of money on this DVD, so I recommend this for your Superman collection. Don't take it too seriously and enjoy!",1373328000,2,1843,4.455621301775148

I requested a second DVD, but it also had come loose in its case  and was rattling around inside.  Whomever replicated these DVDs was pretty sloppy.

288613,4,6300270122,"I know ""Superman III"" gets a lot of flack, mostly because of the inclusion of Richard Pryor, but -- after re-watching it recently -- I was surprised at how satisfying it is once you get used to the presence of Pryor.

Christopher Reeves as Superman is good, of course, but you also have Robert Vaughn as the Luthor-like villain and Pamela Stephenson as his hot female assistant a la Miss Teschmacher. The cast really excels with the inclusion of the beautiful Annette O'Toole as Lana Lang, a sort of replacement for Lois Lane, who barely appears in this installment. Annette is a pleasure to behold throughout.

Once you get used to the presence of Pryor the film really takes off in the second half with Superman fighting his dark side, an obvious type of the inner conflict of flesh & spirit within us all. Even more, there's the satisfying redemption of a certain character that illustrates how a person can make a huge mistake and still be applicable for redemption, as long as he or she is willing. The film just leaves you with a good feeling.

BOTTOM LINE: I suppose it's not as good as the first two, but ""Superman III"" really delivers if you overlook all the bashing and give it a chance. Richard Pryor is goofy, but amusing and likable; and Annette O'Toole shines. Most of all, the movie is deeper than what meets the eye and effectively conveys powerful truths about the human condition and potential.

The film runs 125 minutes.

Superman has long had a cheesy side to him, it's no secret, but in trying to uber-emphasize that aspect of the character above all else, this stretches itself way, way too thin. If one were to remove the rich, interesting back-story from the first two films, cram every forced, campy slapstick pun into one long reel and inexplicably insert Richard Pryor at his mainstream worst, the final product would look startlingly similar to Superman III. The shameless Luthor stand-in's villainous plot is vacant and nonsensical, Lois Lane is written out after twelve lines, The Man of Steel himself is basically a supporting character, and both the central plot vehicle and the final battle are so far over the top they've lost sight of the Earth.

288617,2,6300270122,"And this movie shows, that Richard Lester knew nothing about Superman. It's already been said, but I'll say it again. Superman is a supporting character in his own movie, it literally opens up like a comedy spoof. And the whole movie plays that way, a ton of gags, then Clark ducks into a photobooth, changes into Superman to rescue a man drowning in his car after he ran over a fire hydrant. Ooooookay, then Superman disappears for the next 10 minutes. Until Clark and Jimmy are stopped on their way to Smallville, by a chemical fire. Superman saves the day, and then disappears again. But hey, Richard Pryor gets tons of meaningless scenes, like getting off a bus, showing up at a small computer building in smallville in the middle of the night, just to get the guard drunk, so he could hack into the computer without getting caught. He creates a fake piece of Kryptonite, which does turn Superman evil. BUT EVEN AFTER THAT, WE DON'T SEE MUCH OF SUPERMAN, instead we Ross Webster, his sister, and the brainless blond who literally adds nothing to movie. Come to think of it, none of the other characters do either, Annette O'toole does her best as Lana Lang. But I don't blame her, Shoot Christopher Reeve tries in this movie, and you can. The crowing moment of the movie, is the fight in the Junkyard between Clark and the Evil Superman. I usually pop the DVD in, skip to that part. And watch the movie from that point to the end, and it's a credit to chris to pull off being evil, and being Clark in that scene. But after that moment, Superman now restored to himself. Flies off to battle Ross Webtster, his sister, the brainless blond, and Richard Pryor's Gus Gorman, now Lois Lane is also in the movie all of five minutes.

288659,4,6300270122,"While Superman III carries quite a degree of angst from the Superman fan base, I tend to think of it as a preferred installment from the heaviness of the first two films. Of course the original film remains THE standard from which no Superman incarnation will ever match. Why they even try and retell it is something of a mystery to me. It can't be done any better. And while Superman II is a worthy follow up, I tend to get bored with that installment because it's whole story line is set up to deliver the pay off of Superman fighting the aliens. And while that fight is okay, it's somewhat dull compared with today's standards. So that's not much of reason to sit through two hours of story telling these days. Superman III doesn't suffer from this. It has a nice variety of action, humor, and intrigue. Especially when Clark stands off against himself as Superman. And while it's computer story is dated by today's standards, it's intent is forward thinking for it's day. I did not find the humor distracting in the least. I felt the series was bordering on becoming too camp after Superman II. Zod was a nice antagonist but I could only take so much of his stilted dialogue as ""ruler of Houston"". So to inject some deliberate comedy from Richard Pryor allowed me to take Superman's role much more serious. It grounded him in a way the last sequel had not. To me, Pryor's character was the every man. He was a fella down on his luck, facing hard times and tripped across something he could do brilliantly. He was as benevolent as we he was lovable. Robert Vaughn was fun with his corporate villainy, but did come off a bit dry on his delivery. But overall I found the film to be a fun ride taking on a number of different story lines with refreshing appeal. The film is anything but predictable. So Superman III, for myself, is easily the best sequel in the series.",1347062400,,1869,4.4678362573099415

288662,2,6300270122,"Wow. Just watched this movie after many years... and I remember it being better. it was quite weak compared to the first two films. Only the evil Superman subplot and the return to Smallville save it from being a complete failure.

Contrary to Parts I and II, this one tries to shed much of the staples of Superman. No more Fortress of solitude, Ma Kent has already passed on!, Jor-El nowhere to be found! The writers didn't even bother to use one of the many comic book villains. The Parasite or Brainiac would have been a better choice than RIchard Prior and his movie cohorts, who spend most of the film bickering and hamming it up. Instead we get some really bad gags, including a five minute slapstick session at the opening credits as well as a groan inducing scene where two traffic light men have a fight as part of the carnage caused by Richard Pryor's computer genius Gus Gorman.

On the plus side, Christopher Reeve and Annette O'Toole (as Lana Lang) are both great in their roles, as are most of the actors, but the Daily Planet characters are absent for most of the film and are only there briefly as lip service to justify this as a Superman film. Too bad Richard Donner was forced to end his involvement with this series as we could have had a wonderful third installment instead of this dated, uneven film.

Its interesting to see alot of early 1980's culture and Christopher Reeve is a very good actor to watch regardless of the productions mess. The scene with Clark fighting the evil Superman is worth it, otherwise clear off! Very poorly made! It may have worked then in 1983, but it clearly does not hold up. There is no evidence of director Richard Donner's touches (1 and 2{Donner Cut}). The silly producers that fired and cut off Donner, cut the life off of the Superman series. Why did they think Superman is a comedy? What fools! Seeing part 3 makes you long for 1 & 2(Donner Cut).",1334448000,,691,4.282442748091603

Now that I've seen it again I'm fairly horrified; it has no redeeming qualities at all. The plot is bad and is loosely assembled at best, the acting is worse.

 Superman's powers are entirely inconsistent throughout the film and practically nothing he does AT ALL is the simple way to do things.  Why fly to the lake to freeze the surface when he could have just blown on the acid?  He heat visioned the entire country of Columbia, stops a harvester with his bare hands, and takes a head-on hit by several missiles, but a couple of semi-sentient ribbon cables nearly strangle him? Seriously?

Not even Superman seems to be able to tell what kinds of things can hurt him.  Forget how or why he's fighting himself, but why put himself in a trash compactor he knows won't leave a scratch on him?  And containing himself with rubber tires?  A toddler could get out of that cunning trap without even having super-full diapers.

But it's only a matter of time before Superman finds himself having to prevent Ross from taking over the world's oil supply. You already know something is seriously wrong here judging from the beginning of this movie which looks a lot more like one of Richard Pryor's movies and a lot less like a Superman movie.

Boring villains, too much silliness, and not enough emphasis on Superman really makes this movie quite inferior to the first two films. On the plus side though, Is Christopher Reeve who still turns in a great performance as the title character and Annette O Toole as Lana is also pretty good here [I'd take her over Margot Kidder ANY DAY of the week!!!!]. But the true highlight of this movie is a very memorable subplot which involves Superman being given man-made Kryptonite which brings about his evil side [Superman even gets drunk in this movie LOL] which culminates in a classic battle between Clark Kent and Superman in a junkyard which is pretty much the main saving grace of this movie. As stated by many people, Richard Pryor had absolutely no business being in this movie [Even if he did provide a couple laughs] and had he not been in this movie and there was a better villain for Superman to face in this movie, Superman III could've been another classic. But i will be first to say that this movie is not as bad as some people claim it to be.

""Superman III"" is one of the more harshly criticized movies in the series that stars Christopher Reeve, and I think most of the criticism is without merit.  It is significantly different in tone from the first two movies, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Mr. Reeve returns as Clark Kent and Superman in this 1983 sequel, and the cast around him is made up of series veterans and newcomers.  Though Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, Jackie Cooper's Perry White, and Marc McClure's Jimmy Olsen receive a significant reduction in screentime, the characters that replace them are entertaining.  Arguably the most discussed of these is Richard Pryor's portrayal of Gus Gorman, the computer hacker turned aide to Ross Webster, this movie's main villain.  Mr. Pryor is genuinely charming and very humorous in a more cleancut mode than was the comic's typical style.  As a replacement for an absent Gene Hackman, Robert Vaughn really has a thankless task and yet he acquits himself nicely.  A ruthless businessman who craves a monopoly on the world's oil, Ross Webster is a more straightforward villain than Hackman's Lex Luthor ever was and the change is a welcome one.  Annette O'Toole(T.V.'s ""Smallville"") is perfect as a thirtysomething Lana Lang in a storyline where Clark reconnects with her in a class reunion at Smallville High.

Superman also turns evil after an exposure to green kryptonite, and Christopher Reeve is callous and chilling playing the evil side of his character.  An epic psychological and physical battle in a deserted junkyard is an effective setpiece as the moral goodness that Clark Kent represents is tested by the unbridled physical power of Superman.

""Superman III"" is much better than its general reputation would suggest, and newcomers may be surprised at its quality.",1284940800,5,1813,5.129251700680272

288708,5,6300270122,"""You can't take it with you,"" I've heard said. It's true: one cannot take it with one. When I heard this line (not in Superman III), I began to reflect in a way that I had never reflected before. When one dies--I mean, really dies--what does he carry from this life into the next? Not one's material objects, they are fleeting. One's memories? I hope so, because if I can't bring my film prints (material objects), and I can't bring my memories, then how will I bring Superman III to the afterworld? (I do not know what kind of afterworld there is, or if there is one at all, although I believe that there is.) If there was one thing in this non-permanent world that I could bring over into eternity, it would be Superman III. This is absolutely true. The only reason I'm alive right now is because of Superman III--what else is there in this world of suffering and tragedy? And yet, I am frightened by death. I am afraid of death because I don't know if there will be Superman III on The Other Side. Yes, horrible, terrible things have happened to me, and horrible, terrible things await me, and yet every day I am ""in joy"" (to quote Jim Perry) because Superman III is out there, and I know it so thoroughly, it's in my memory, I know every line, every shot, every gesture (and yet, still yet, there is always more to be discovered!), it is with me interminably, and it makes death frightening. I don't think that there is cinema in the other world, which is very, very depressing. I don't even want to talk about how sad it is. I weep, nightly. This movie was made by ""life-affirm[er]"" Richard Lester (""The Beatles A Hard Day's Night,"" ""The Beatles Help!""), and it really stands above anything else out there. The comedy is very, VERY spot-on, with Richard Pryor doing his funny-man routine...it is very, very righteous, but it is also a classic character, a man who fights with his morality (good vs. evil), and comes out on top (he turns out good)! He is the quintessiantal human character, ""Odyssey-esque"" (as old Cock used to say), an everyman for today. Superman (who is superhuman) also fights the ultimate--I would even say PENultimate (best ever) good vs. evil scene...he fights with himself..........Literally! Clark Kent fights with his evil impulses, personified as Superman with a slight stubble (this technically dazzling scene was accomplished with the use of split-screen technology and stand-ins, who look VERY convincing), and comes out on top--barely! I can't get enough of it. Also, there is a pretty girl in this film (can you guess who?). Thanks to the Warner Brothers for putting this one out on DVD, why did it take so long!!!! The Warner Brothers really care about their customers, and that's what sets them apart. My only complaint is that Lois Lane doesn't get enough screen time in this movie, perhaps as a result of M. Kidder's condition.",1266278400,4,2868,4.658777120315582

Not to take anything away from the other actors who got the chance to wear the red cape and blue tights, I think that Christopher Reeve will always be remembered as the one who gave the best portrayal of The Man of Steel. As for my review of this the 3rd installment, I must say that there is a rule that you must follow. Know when to stop while you are ahead. The first two movies were awesome. It wouldn't have made a difference if the original director/writers had been around for Superman III. There is a thing called overkill, and by the 3rd seaquel of a film you begin to start yawning.

There are some good points in this film and Christopher Reeve was great again as Superman/Clark Kent. My four star rating is based on that. The first two films were more serious so the sudden change to include more humor hurts the credibility, and for like of better words makes the film look like a joke. Not even Richard Pryor and the trio of new evil folks could fill the void left by the absence of Lex Luther and Lois Lane. This film was a chance for the series to end with a somewhat decent send off, however the decline was clear.",1259193600,4,1229,4.274678111587983

Mr Pryor basically is hating life and wants to make some cash.  He learns how to program and bam he's mastered the banking software and does the infamous rounding off the pennies and saving it for yourself hack.  As far as geeky hackers go, you could do a lot worse than Pryor; but the best (worst) part is that he is simply left to his own devices.  The true big bad builds this super computer thingy that Pryor designs and with it almost beats Supes, end of movie.

288712,2,6300270122,"""After Superman: The Movie's epic storytelling and Superman II's awesome battles, how could the first two hits be topped?"" Well definately not by this one! Lester takes on as director in this one (only three quarters of Superman II was his), he falls flat. The only reason this is even getting two stars is because of Christopher Reeve, who continues to give everything he's got to the character. This time acting out good and evil sides of Superman (though I will admit that Superman's ""evil"" deeds come across as misdemeanors at best. Even the repositioning of Pisa comes across not really being all that evil, though probably more of the writers fault than Reeve). His scenes with Lana (played by Annette O'Toole, the only other saving grace in this picture, who would later star in Smallville, which I think shames the Superman franchise, but that's only my opinion) are well acted and you can see that Clark still has a high school crush on her. Pryor is not funny. Not at all. The only reason he was in this one is because the producers saw him on Johnny Carson and he said how much he loved part II, which is a stupid reason for anyone to be cast in a film. Robert Vaughn does what he can with Ross Webster (who is more or less a clone of Luthor) but he at least comes off better than Pryor. The story is downright shameful to what they had in the first two films. Gorman miraculously discovers he has a talent for computer programming when he can't even keep a job for more than 28 minutes? And none of his previous jobs had him anywhere near computers anyway. And there's the satellite which can be reprogrammed to create weather? Yeah I have a better chance of believing people flying around in space without any oxygen. Well the Salkinds did always want to make a campy Superman film and they did it. I guess they figured that with Donner and Mankiewicz out of the way, people would see this movie just because it has Superman. They should've stuck with their original idea of having Brainiac, Supergirl and Mr. Mxyzptlk involved. In fact, Gorman was supposed to be Brainiac (which would explain the supercomputer having a life of its own) but it was not to be. Little did we know though, that twelve years from now, Batman would be facing campy problems with his third movie. Coincidence? The action sequences are subpar, the only really exciting set pieces are Superman vs. Clark in the junkyard, the Grand Canyon missile attack and to lesser extents, the chemical factory scene and the supercomputer. And I guess nobody decided to tell the editor that the wires are visible in a few scenes. Couldn't they have smudged them out? Even if they didn't do it back then, they definately could've done it now, this being a Deluxe Edition. Ken Thorne, I think, is probably the only one besides Reeve and O'Toole, who didn't mess up this picture. His music sounds better with this (and thank goodness you can hardly hear the songs. They sounded horrible). This had so much potential and it pains me to give a DC movie two stars featuring one of my favorite superheroes (I usually reserve that for Marvel's movies though this movie was better than Spider-Man 3).",1252454400,5,3166,4.615248226950355

Superman was forced to battle a Super computer. He destroyed it with a container of acid. This wasn't the greatest Superman movie but it was still good.

Meanwhile, Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve) convinces Perry White (Jackie Cooper) to let him attend his High School Reunion in Smallville, while Lois (Margot Kidder) goes on a vacation to Bermuda. At the reunion, he was reunited with Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) who is now a mother to Ricky (Paul Kaethler). At Ricky's birthday party, Gus and Vera, in disguise as soldiers give Superman a messed-up chunk of Kryptonite in an attempt to kill him, but due to a minor component modification, it causes him to slowly go crazy. He became negligent at his duties and messed things up by causing an oil spill and moving the Leaning Tower of Piza straight. Then the gang plot to use the satellites to control Earth's weather. When Superman sank into alcoholism and depression in front of everyone, Ricky pleads for him to snap out of it and that plea gives him the strength to fight it.

288715,2,6300270122,"Extra! Extra!

Read all about it!

Producers destroy Superman film series with large amounts of cheese!

I got the Deluxe Edition. I enjoy the extras like the deleted scenes, and the commentary by the ever funny Ilya Salkind & P. Spengler. There is just something I like about Ilya Salkind, I don't know what it is.

The duality struggle of Superman was the only concept in this entire movie that has any real major motion picture value. The rest plays like a light weight overly family friendly T.V. quality production. yes, you see lots of wires showing. In the opening credits scene, they uses a extremely cheap method of just blurring the top of the image to hide the wires. These guys have no shame!

The bad jokes and prat falls start right off the bat with what seems to be a homage to the old Buster Keaton films of almost 100 years ago. that's right, a full 5 minuet Buster Keaton tribute in a Superman film.

We then get nothing new or exciting to the superman universe for the next hour.

Included are, an obligatory Daily Planet scene where we get absolutely none of the clever dialog that was present in the original film (or Donner shot segments of the second). Sure it's great to see the gang together again, but I can re-watch the original Superman The Movie for that. Hi Lois, bye Lois. Now on to a ho-hum factory fire with lame effects. These are the kind of effect gags you now see as part of a run of the mill movie studio theme park tour. Next, we meet our Lex Luthor clone. Robert Vaughn, poor poor Robert Vaughn. Let's move on.

Richard Pryor does a good job with this role. Problem is, that this role should NOT be in a Superman film. Fact is, that this movie looks to me as nothing more then a way for the then Producers to make money, and at the same time butter up studio people in Hollywood. They did absolutely no more then they had to, then to deliver a product that would be acceptable under contracts. This project lacks that feeling of Love that the first film (and parts of the second) had. The Smallvile scenes lack any feeling of Americana nostalgia. Annette O' Toole was great casting, and she is a wonderful adult version of the Lana we had been introduced to in the first film. It's her son we don't need. Anything that has to do with the character of little Ricky is purely nauseating. It's unfortunate that Reeve strongly supported this sugar coated family friendly type element in the films. Due to this twisted view of Reeve's, another nauseating little nerd would be a major part of the Superman IV plot.

Now we start to get to the only worthy part of the film. The evil Superman sub-plot.

Sure, Reeve did a great job playing the evil side of Superman. His acting in the Bar, outside on the street, and then in the Junkyard is some of his best acting as Superman he had ever done. To give the writers some credit (and I truly hate to), the use of common Tobacco Tar as a replacement for an unknown element needed to synthesize Kryptonite was clever and amusing.

Pure Kryptonite would have slowly killed Superman (as it was doing to him in the first film). In Superman III, Guss Gorman uses a deep space probe and computer to identify the elements within Kryptonite. The computer returned something like 97% of the elements needed. The last 3% where classified by the computer as unknown. Not wanting to give up, Gorman just used the first element that came to mind for the last 3%. That element was TAR.

The only time Superman can really show off how super he is, is when he is fighting a force (or forces) as great (or greater) then himself. Any scenes of superman doing any of his super-feats that does not involve such an element became boring right after his night of rescues shown in the first movie. The Factory Fire, Wheat Field Rescue, Bomb at Eiffel Tower (once superman arrives), Lois's Subway Rescue in IV, etc. are all just ok scenes, but they became obligatory very fast in the series. I'm with the camp of people who say that it would have been great in part IV, if instead of Nuclear Man, the foe would have been evil Superman played by Reeve. But due to the fact the idea was wasted in (or saved) Superman III, it was not done.

The only other note worthy scene, is the end battle with the super computer. As I am sure other reviewers have said, This part of the film can become scary for very young children (under 8).

This movie will most likely entertain older children (8 - 12), and disappoint most older then that.  The campy style, and goody goody Reagan Era softness killed any chance of this becoming an epic super hero action film like the original.

So the bottom line is:
Great for Kids (9-12), Great if you need to own all the movies (good or bad), and great if you love anything with Chris Reeve in it.
Get the Deluxe Edition if you enjoy deleted scenes and commentary.",1244678400,2,4847,4.429213483146067
288716,5,6300270122,"I guess I am in the minority on this, but I honestly think this 3rd chapter was the best of the 4.

Very quickly, we meet Richard Pryor who is a down on his luck man who can not hold a job. But he finally finds a spot as a computer programmer, where he accidentally uncovers his hidden talents. He is willing to play a few 'cheat games' with the computers for a bit of financial gain. (So the hint of the developing villain is there. BUT, on the other hand, he does NOT want anyone to really get hurt, and that will define his character. After being caught stealing $85,000. from his work place, his boss is so impressed, that he wants Pryor to exploit the other possible capabilities of computers for exploitation on a much greater scale.

Superman (or should I say Clark Kent) goes back to his home town for his high school reunion. And we meet Lana and Brad (whom we met briefly in Part 1). Lana still likes Clark. But Brad still hates Clark. And in this small town, Clark Kent and Richard Pryor bump into each other (literally)! Great irony! (Pryor is on a mission to destroy the coffee grounds of Columbia.)

Superman thwarts this plan, but Pryor's boss (Vaughn) wants Superman dead now. Vaughn's new plan is to gain control of the world's oil supplies. (And we can see that Pryor understandably starts to get cold feet as Vaughn becomes more ruthless and ambitious.)

In a failed plan by Vaughn to kill Superman, there is an interesting side affect. Superman becomes darker and more selfish. (This really shows Reeve's acting abilities by the way.) This ends in a climactic showdown where Superman must fight the evil in himself! This is arguably the GREATEST scene in the whole saga!

Moving on, Superman has to fight this ultimate computer (constructed for Vaughn for world conquest) that can fight back on its own. And somehow, we get the impression that if Richard Pryor does not have a change of heart, 'The Man of Steel may be destroyed by steel.' (So it is not only superpowers that may save the day, but personal redemption as well. GREAT!)

Overall, I grant this 3rd chapter the top spot because it has the perfect combination and intervals of normalcy, menace, comic relief, unfolding events, surprises, horror, and even redemption.

That may be true, but there is another major plot element that no one seems to remember, and that is Superman's disturbing degeneration into a dark, angry, malicious, and embittered soul, as the result of a near fatal encounter with synthetic kryptonite. Seeing the once selfless superhero lapse into a vicious, drunken SOB, walking around with a two day beard, and a grungy, filthy outfit could be the most frightening image I've ever seen of this legendary character, and Christopher is brilliant in his portrayal of the Superhero gone sour. Anyone who ever thought Mr. Reeve was type-cast as the ""good guy"" should just watch this, and they will know that had he lived longer, or avoided his accident, he surely could have played a villain of some form or other in another franchise.",1219363200,3,929,4.77639751552795

The special effects are great as is the music.  The most memorable scene is the junk yard scene where Clark battles with his evil self (perhaps the most well known scene in all the Superman movies).

This DVD edition features an audio commentary, making of documentary, deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer.  Another thing I have noticed is although the sound is still 2.0 Surround it is more defined in the left and right speakers where as the 2001 release utilized only the center speaker.

Lana was to Clark Kent in Smallville what Lois is to Superman in Metropolis if that made any sense? Lana's country girl character was always written to be more interested in ""Clark Kent"" while city girl reporter Lois Lane was always written to dismiss Clark but have desires for ""Superman"". Annette O'Toole portrays Lana Lang in the film and Margot Kidder has a few scenes as Lois Lane. The scene where the two women meet is a clash in character studies.

Amidst Webster, Vera, and Gus's manipulations of computers, Superman arrives to right their wrongs but in doing so triggers a plot devised by Webster to seek revenge on Superman. Webster recalls reading that Kryptonite is one of Superman's weaknesses. Webster then demands Gus find a way to manufacture Kryptonite. While on the computer, Gus has found a basic formula/recipe to manufacture Kryptonite but one ingredient is missing. He looks at his cigarette pack and types in the word ""tar"" as a missing ingredient. Later, Clark is asked by Lana to see if he could talk or ask Superman into appearing at a small gathering for the community of Smallville. Superman makes his appearance...and the small gathering is in reality a town wide festival honoring Superman's arrival in Smallville. Gus, Vera, and company interrupt the festivities dressed in military disguise...driving into the throng of people in an army truck. Gus makes his way to the stage...then a mini-stand-up routine takes place as Gus exaggerates the vocalization of military leaders. Once he is through, he gives Superman a token of the military's appreciation...this token is the man-made Kryptonite. Gus walks off the stage and the festivities conclude...Superman appears to have not been affected by the Kryptonite.

Later, the effects of this man-made Kryptonite take shape...clouding Superman's judgment and causing him to become sinister. In an awkward scene, Superman attempts to have his way with Lana Lang in spite of her warning him about a potential disaster...he would have succeeded in seducing Lana had he not snapped out, for just a split second, of the Kryptonite mind control and off he flew to see if he could be of any help...learning that he arrived just seconds too late to save the fallen vehicle. Afterward the man-made Kryptonite takes full effect. In one famous or infamous scene, Superman punctures an oil rig letting thousand upon thousand of gallons of oil flood the ocean. Also, in one of the most recognized scenes from the movie, Superman is at a bar drunk and flinging peanuts at the beer and wine bottles. Another comical scene involves Superman straightening the Leaning Tower of Pisa and yawning at an Olympic event, accidentally blowing out the torch the runner was carrying. Superman even has a one night stand with Webster's secretary. In hindsight, this man-made Kryptonite which was green in color had the effects of Red Kryptonite in that it didn't pose any lethal effects on Superman directly...it more or less caused/created unpredictable effects on him, which is in step with the character's depiction in comic books and cartoons.

The effects of the red Kryptonite wear off in the city's junkyard. There, Superman splits in half. The evil Superman and the good Clark Kent. The two engage in a battle...i can't call it a bloody battle because either of them aren't human to begin with. Superman appears to have the most strength but Clark continues to take everything he can...when it appears the battle is over with and Clark's seen his end in a car crushing machine, evil Superman destroys Clark's glasses...then, Clark frees himself and defeats evil Superman by strangling him. Once the evil Superman vanishes from sight as Clark continues to strangle him, it signals to the viewers that the effects of the red Kryptonite have worn off and that Clark Kent has regained control over Superman and that Superman is good again, not evil.

Webster, in the meantime, built a mega computer for Gus based on designs that Gus created himself...this is what Gus wanted in exchange for creating man-made Kryptonite. Webster, Vera, and his assistant start playing with the computer...Gus arrives to see everyone having their kicks and not long afterward Superman makes his appearance. The secretary confronts Superman and asks ""do you remember me?"" and Superman, being on the side of justice again, relates to her ""i've not seen you before, Miss..."" and she says ""but the other night"", i think, and Superman asserts ""that was not me"". A battle at the computer soon ensues with the computer having developed a mind of it's own. The computer fires out a ray of green kryptonite energy at Superman, weakening him. Gus destroys the ray beam device and Superman flies off...returning with acid. The computer doesn't recognize it as harmful but it ultimately spells the end of the computer...it's chemicals interact with the computer and a massive melt down occurs. Vera is turned into a cyborg...and ultimately dies while Webster and his secretary receive their just rewards.

Later, Gus is depicted as an antihero. A bad guy with a heart of gold and Superman flies him to a work site, a coal mine. The employer offers Gus a job and after Superman leaves, Gus refuses...preferring to ""walk home"" in spite of how long a walk it'll be. As Clark Kent, Superman gives Lana a diamond ring to replace the one she no longer had saying it's from Superman. The diamond coming from the coal mine...Superman crushing the coal into the form of a diamond. He excuses himself and repairs the oil tanker he destroyed and straightens the Tower of Pisa to where it's leaning again. These acts help restore his reputation and Superman is seen as a good guy in the eyes of the world again after lots of destruction he caused mid-way through the movie.

All in all, the movie was entertaining and enthralling and it showcased the effects of red Kryptonite on Superman, even though in the film it was called ""synthetic kryptonite"" and carried a green color. The effects of it were in step with red Kryptonite. Richard Pryor, for all the complaints he's gotten and the producers/writers of the movie and all the complaints they've gotten, I couldn't find anything in the movie that lived up to all of the negative comments. Pryor at his core is a comedian...I wouldn't expect anything serious and heavy hitting from him on film and so I wasn't disappointed. It's a fun movie all-around.",1217721600,5,7474,4.960095770151636

While there are a few moments that help out this movie, on the whole, it's not enough. It's intriguing to see Superman turn evil through his exposure to tainted Kryptonite (reminiscent of Red Kryptonite). And the battle in the junkyard between good and bad Superman (reminiscent of Superman vs. Bizarro) is, again, intriguing. But neither really reaches its full potential to thrill and enthrall the audience.

In the end, what really hurts this movie is a lack of ""super"" scope. This can largely be brought down to the fact that they didn't bring Lex Luthor into this story. Ross Webster just isn't charismatic enough to keep the audience watching. What we have here is a greedy business man who is trying to control the worlds oil. Bad, yes. Superman worthy? We never get a full sense that it is.

Now, if Lex Luthor had been doing the same thing, there would automatically be a sense that the world is in danger and Superman needs to jump in and save it. Doubtless, this would only be the first step in a master plan for something truly evil to come. True, Lex's plan in the first movie revolved around real estate, but the methods were brutal, with the entire western coastline and its inhabitants in jeopardy. Webster's plan, however, boils down to ""We'll tell everyone's computers to stop oil production. They'll never be able to stop that. Bwa Ha Ha Ha Haaaa!""

Then there is the heightened attempt at humor in this film. Director Richard Lester decided to make this one a funnier outing, since it is based on a comic book. A little humor now and then is okay and even refreshing when dealing with a truly epic story like Superman deserves. However it is a bit too much here at times. For instance, the beginning of the movie is an entire vaudeville routine causing chaos throughout the city of Metropolis with sight gags and running gags and any other kind of gag you can think of. It just feels out of place.

In the end, this one is definitely better than the fourth movie, but it pales in comparison to the first two.",1210032000,2,2069,4.583783783783784
288755,3,6300270122,"I recently took another look at the big screen debacle entitled ""Superman III,"" which initiated the beloved movie franchise's rocketing descent into oblivion 25 years ago.  As expected, time hasn't been kind to the third ""Superman"" film.

If you were to look over this film's credits, the potential seemingly was all there: Christopher Reeve as Superman; competent director Richard Lester (who also directed ""Superman II""); two of the original film's screenwriters; a great special FX crew; plus the added bonus of comedian Richard Pryor, who was still semi-hot at the time.  Therefore, how could this much talent transform a likely sure-fire hit into such a colossal goose egg?

Primarily, I suspect it comes down to a lackluster script that was not even close to the same league as the first two films.  The basic storyline on paper may have been okay at best, but as a motion picture, the franchise's classy tongue-in-cheek humor and timeless reverence to the Man of Steel pretty much evaporate in favor of incorporating Richard Pryor's bumbling computer geek character (Gus Gorman) into the story.  The result of providing Mr. Pryor sufficient screen time to justify his hefty salary reduced other pivotal supporting players, like Jackie Cooper (as Perry White) and even Margot Kidder (as Lois Lane) to mere book-end cameo appearances.  As at least one other reviewer points out, forcibly melding a Richard Pryor comedy with ""Superman"" simply doesn't work.

Also, the campy screenplay suffers from too few thrills, with the exception of the Superman vs. Clark Kent auto graveyard battle, which was superb.  Christopher Reeve appeared game during the various stunt sequences, but the special FX, while they seem initially great, deteriorate badly by the time Superman enters the Grand Canyon for his final showdown with the villains.  Obviously, the special FX budget (not to mention, composer John Williams' masterful score) were among the cost-cutting decisions made by the producers.

As for the other scenes, there is little worth remembering about them (who really wants to watch Superman being infected by tar-flavored kryponite?).  The romantic sub-plot featuring Annette O'Toole (as Lana Lang) and Clark Kent was nicely handled, but, logically, shouldn't Lois Lane have been the one (instead of Lana) present during the evil Superman plot twist?  Once again, the script's ineffective sense of continuity comes into play here.

As for the main villains, Robert Vaughn (as Ross Webster) is an awfully weak substitute to follow up Gene Hackman (as Lex Luthor) as Superman's new nemesis.  I definitely agree with a fellow reviewer that Webster and his female entourage are really little more than a cheap knock-off of Lex Luthor, Otis, & Ms. Teschmacher.  If Richard Pryor had instead played Webster (while eliminating Gus Gorman entirely), that could have been an intriguing proposition.  Personally, though, I really would have preferred an edgy actor like Christopher Walken (much like he was in ""A View to a Kill,"" and ""Batman Returns,""), who could have created a creepy antagonist truly worthy of tangling with the legendary Man of Steel.

Speaking of which, the ""Ultimate Computer"" could have been (and probably should have been) transformed into a realistic variation of the classic Superman villian, Brainiac.  The premise of an almighty evil computer that just wants to survive is a monstrous concept that would hold up extremely well today.  Unfortunately, as depicted in this film, the ""Ultimate Computer"" looks so incredibly phony that it becomes a major detriment to the franchise's reputation for providing top notch special FX.

Among the special edition DVD's bonus features, there are the following: 1. the making of ""Superman III"" documentary (which is worth viewing, particularly for Christopher Reeve's interview); 2. cast filmographies; and 3. the obligatory trailer.  Here's an interesting bit of trivia: the young actor at the Metropolis photo booth seen briefly during the opening sequence also had earlier played toddler Kal-El during the original film's initial Smallville sequence.

In summation, the two big reasons why this film fails, I believe, come down to an uninspired script offering little excitement and not enough laughs, as well as far too much reliance on Richard Pryor and Robert Vaughn as the miscast villains.  If director Richard Donner, screenwriters Mario Puzo and Tom Mankiewicz, and composer John Williams had all been present for ""Superman III,"" they probably would have made a world of difference.  Unfortunately, another vintage performance by the much-missed Christopher Reeve alone couldn't save this film from the ravages of mediocre filmmaking.

Final Grade: a weak 3/5.  Christopher Reeve's iconic presence as Superman is the film's only enduring asset.  The brief scene of Reeve flying over the Atlantic Ocean, as Superman goes to rescue a crippled oil tanker, made me believe I was viewing a legitimate superhero in flight, not simply an actor on wires.

Side Note: I do, however, heartily recommend William Kotzwinkle's long out-of-print novelization of this movie.  His cynical wit packs in plenty of chuckles despite the script's weak material.  You can probably find a cheap copy easily enough on Amazon.com.",1207612800,2,5277,5.3140794223826715
288756,3,6300270122,"Superman III starts out like an old slap stick comedy act. After throwing caution to the wind in Superman II, I guess they figured they could get away with anything!?? The film has a reputation for being really awful, but it's mildly entertaining and actually has moments of brilliants. I loved the evil Superman segments and I was happy to see a different villian. All but Reeves from the original cast phone in their performances and the FX budget looks like it was cut. This could have been a really good installment, but it seems like a quick cash in to me. Compared to part IV..........!",1206921600,2,592,4.59433962264151
288757,4,6300270122,"Superman III is one of those films that spark a lot of debate among fans of the series. The fans are split on this one, but it seems more people dislike it in general. I understand both sides of the argument on why some people see Superman III as a good movie and others see it as a bad movie. As a whole Superman III in my opinion doesn't live up to the previous 2 installments; I know some people will go crazy over this comment, but I actually prefer this over Richard Donner's cut of Superman II. So that would make Superman III, my 3rd favorite of the series.

I'm in the minority when I say I liked Lester's cut of Superman II more than Donner's, but of course Richard Donner was still a big reason for the success of Superman II since a lot of his footage made it's way into the final cut. This time around it's all Richard Lester and Superman III is a little uneven. Lester was more interested in the comedy aspect of Superman and while the comedy worked well in Superman II it's hit or miss in Superman III.

At times I found Superman III a little too over the top in the comedy department. Some scenes could have played a little straighter or even some light humor, but Lester makes it way too over the top and also there is too much comedy at times and that does take a way from the movie. Certain scenes have to be played that way; sometimes people forget the script. If the scenes are written a little silly playing it straight won't work well. Some scenes though really could have been played straight with a little comedy, but Lester options for the laughs and quite honestly it works well for some scenes, but falls flat in others.

Screenwriters David & Leslie Newman did a pretty good job with the script, but they also fail in a lot of areas. The one thing that has always bothered me a bit is Clark's obsession with Lois Lane. I think it's safe to say we have liked a girl and for the women reading this a guy, that was based on looks. It might be superficial but most of us are guilty of that. I understand why Clark likes Lois, but she pretty much ignores him and well isn't always that nice to him. In Superman III we are introduced to Lana Lang played by Annette O'Toole.

There really was a lot of potential with Clark and Lana. I like Lois Lane, but Lana was a lot nicer and she actually was nice to Clark and seemed to be interested in him. The plot worked really well for the first half of the movie, but than suddenly Lana pretty much goes MIA for most of the 2nd half only appearing in a couple of brief scenes that really don't add much to the plot.

I think the Lana/Clark scenes really helped flesh out the movie and really worked very well. But in the 2nd half that plot is pretty much wrapped up and wrapped up rather weakly there really isn't any closure. It seems like the makers forgot to film those scenes. We spend so much of the first half seeing something possibly develop between Clark and Lana all for nothing in the end as it never goes anywhere.

Lois Lane only appears briefly and while I did like the character and I like Margot Kidder a lot it was a nice change to have somebody else instead of her, but I would have liked to have seen more screen time giving to Lois. But Superman III doesn't lack without Kidder, Annette O'Toole does a solid job at making up for the loss of Margot Kidder.

Another problem with the script was the character of Ross Webster played by Robert Vaughn. Simply put he was the poor mans version of Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor. Even though Ross Webster is the main villain too little is done with his character. He has no depth and just really isn't very interesting. Vaughn plays the role well and does the best he can, but the character wasn't fleshed out nearly enough and again is just a clone of Lex Luthor. If I didn't know any better I would think the role was written for Hackman to play Luthor. Webster really is Lex Luthor with a different name.

Richard Pryor seemed a little out of place at times in the movie while he does play the character of Gus Gorman rather well there was too much focus on him at times. It's good to focus on the supporting players. Even though this movie is about Clark Kent/Superman it's still good to have the other players involved. But there are too many stretches where the main focus is on Gus, which slows the pace down at times; had there been some more Clark/Superman scenes mixed in I think the movie would have played out much better. In many ways this movie is Gus Gorman and Superman; Pryor just got too much screen time. Some of his scenes really should have been edited down and the pacing would have been a lot better.

The 2nd half of the movie while there is still some comedy it's toned down and also several scenes are played straight and it works very well. Superman III is a little too silly at times and as I stated a couple of times it works well in some areas, but falls flat in others. My biggest complaint though is Gus is helping Ross Webster and even helps him try to kill Superman. Only it doesn't kill him, but makes him evil. But at the end Gus seems outraged at what Ross is trying to do and is even shocked he is trying to kill Superman.

That just annoyed me; why the shock? Not that long ago in the film you tried to help Ross kill Superman so I don't understand why he was so surprised in the final act. Gus wasn't your typical villain and despite what he has done I still don't think he is a villain, but it still annoyed me how he was so shocked.

Christopher Reeve is Clark Kent/Superman; he plays the role to perfection in each installment. He may not be the first actor to play the role, but for people of a certain age he was our first experience of seeing Superman. Christopher Reeve does such a brilliant job as the nerdy Clark Kent, but when it comes time for him to become Superman who is the complete opposite, Reeve pulls it off perfectly. In many ways Christopher Reeve plays double roles and Superman III you can see it as 3 roles. When he becomes evil Superman he is just as believable.

Well I guess it's not fair to call him Evil Superman, he's more of an arrogant selfish jerk. And Christopher Reeve does such a great job, my favorite line is, ""Well I hope you don't expect me to save you, `cause I don't do that anymore."" Simply put Reeve is perfection in all the Superman movies. I highly doubt there will ever be an actor who can rival Christopher Reeve in the role of Clark Kent/Superman.

The highlight of the movie is Clark Kent Vs Superman; that was a great scene and really helps elevate the movie. For that scene alone Superman III is a must see and I'll go as far as saying that was one of the greatest moments in the Superman franchise.

Superman III is overall a very mixed bag; I personally don't think the movie is as bad as so many make it out to be, while yes it's a big drop off from the previous 2 it's still a fun movie. The point of the movie is to entertain and despite the flaws Superman III did just that in my opinion. That is why I give Superman III a 4-star rating; no this isn't a classic movie not as good as the previous 2, but when all is said and done the film entertains and I must say again that is the point of a movie to entertain the viewer.

My review may not be glowing, but Superman III really wasn't so bad; all it really needed was some editing. What's shot is shot, but editing would have greatly fixed the pacing problems. But again Superman III is a fun movie. Superman III won't go down in history as being an all time great, but I still really enjoyed the movie despite my complaints.",1194048000,3,7597,4.240497581202488

288759,4,6300270122,"The beginning of the Superman III gave me doubts that this movie was going to be any good. Yeah, the little jokes here and there were cute, but it just didn't really seem to fit with what was established in the first two films. Luckily, the movie did get better and I ended up loving it by the time it was over. Some of the jokes that were done in the movie are silly and childish, but there are also some jokes in the film that were funny. Some scenes of Richard were good and some were bad, but I overall liked his performance in the film.

There are just a lot of things about this movie that I really did like and made the film for me. I have to say, that it was definitely the part of the movie when Superman turns bad and eventually splits into two personalities due to the man-made Kryptonite. That entire part of the movie I just loved, an evil Superman similar to what the red Kryptonite does to Clark in the TV series Smallville. If you notice, the colors that Superman has when he is bad are the colors of Superman's suit in Superman Returns. The battle between good Clark and evil Superman was pulled of amazingly well. Best scene of the movie.

This film is also Clark's return to Smallville where he reunites with Lana (played my future Smallville actress O'Toole). She did a perfect job as Lana Lang in the film she would have to since the movie is about her with little shown of Lois Lane. Overall, there are a lot of things I can say about this movie but let me just say that I really do recommend this movie, it is fun and very underrated.",1189296000,2,1557,4.221476510067114

When I first saw this movie I was about 4 or 5 and found it to be fun and exciting. In experiencing these four films on DVD in a widscreen movie format as an adult I think Superman 1 through 3 are equally fantastic. What I liked about Superman 3 is precisely what most everyone else seemed to dislike, the lighter more humorous approuch to the story. I thought it was a nice change from the first two films which were very serious, excellent, but serious. It was in the same vain as Star Trek 4 The voyage Home, which was very light, humourous and adventurous. I thought it was a fitting change of pace from the first three, which delt with some very heavy issues as did the first two Superman Films. The new villain in this film was also a nice change, luther had already appeared in the first two, so having superman face off with someone unkown to him was great. I absolutely loved Richard Pryor in this, he was just so funny and his wonderful comic style helped bring a lighter air to this movie. I Agree with the other reviewers that Richard Donner is an excellent director and should not have been replaced, not to take anything way from Mr. Lester who I thought did a great job with Superman 3.

Richard Lester directs this the 3rd movie and screws it up making a movie that is totally unwatchable to me.

The First big mistake is he makes Richard Pryor the star and Superman more of a co-star and thusly making Superman III a comedy and doesn't even try to take itself seriously. It is very campy and is insulting to Richard Donner who never wanted Superman to end up this way.

He also gets rid of Lois Lane only having her in the very beginning and end of the movie, her role feels like a cameo. This is a HUGE mistake since Supermans love interest is always suppose to be Lois Lane, he gave up his powers for her in the second movie and practically forgets all about her in the 3rd. I read that they did this because Margot Kidder spoke publicly about not liking Richard Lester and the Salkinds, well she was right, Richard Lester is an idiot.

He made the villain a selfish rich man who just didn't feel like he had enough in the world and needed to take away from everyone else. He was no where near as interesting as Lex Luther.

I do appreciate when directors or studios decide to change the flow of a franchise to better it but this ruined it. It went against everything Richard Donner set up in the first movie and forgot the movies main character is Superman and not Richard Pryor.

Lois Lane is even a side character in this one. Annette O'Toole (Clark's mom in Smallville) has more screen time here as Clark's High School crush Lana Lang.

  I missed Lois here but she was wasted when there was more of her in Superman 4 anyway. I mean that just uses her for a silly scene where Superman has to think of how to date Lois as Superman  and another woman as Clark at the same time. So this isn't a great Superman movie but at least it wasn't too much of a soap opera that was hard to take seriously  like Superman 4 was either.

As far as the supporting cast is concerned, Margot Kidder's Lois Lane is not given much screen time but Annette O' Toole's Lana Lang (another 'Smallville' TV series staple) fills the role of Clark's old love interest nicely. Richard Pryor's antics take away from much of the credibility of the film but are funny on occasion.  The flying shots are easily the best of the franchise and Reeve is definitely the most buff he has ever been in the role, making his performance that much more entertaining.  Unlike the previous DVD release, there are extras this time around, including a commentary by the producers, a 1983 'Making of' special hosted by Chris Reeve, and almost 20 minutes of deleted scenes!  In closing, while this movie isn't quite as magical as the first two Superman films, a terrific performance by Christopher Reeve and some nice supplemental material makes it worthy of another look.",1160265600,35,1662,5.4941176470588236
288807,2,6300270122,"After the brilliant first two films there was alot of pressure for the Salkind Brothers to produce another great Superman film but sadly in Superman III's case it failed & quite miserably.

The main problem lies with the script, the arch villain Ross Webster could have been stopped by the FBI with his plan for an oil monopoly so why on earth would he be a true villain to Superman is anyone's guess.

Even the supercomputer,just send a few F15 bombers & lets see how its super defence deals with that.

The only true challenge for Superman comes in the middle of the movie & that was with his evil alter ego & should (I believe someone said this earlier) have been the main story instead of this silly super computer story.

Although there were some problems concerning pre production (Margot Kidder had a row with The Producers & therefore only appears for around five minutes in this film) but the casting of Annette O' Toole didn't really affect the film as she's one of the stories strongest characters.

Apart from the Superman Vs Clark fight, & the Lana & Clark scenes, there is not much worth watching & the title joke sequence at the beginning is really cheesey.

And Richard Prior in any film let alone a Superman film is a big enough joke.

Years later, when I saw the Superman Collection, I thought to myself, maybe it wasn't that bad, I was only a kid, so maybe I just didn't get some of it.  Well it happened to be on TV last night, so I watched it.  What a piece of junk. The acting was so bad, the special effects look like they were produced in the special ed class. They tried adding humor, but the slapstick was so lame it wasn't even funny.  It was a total waste of time, even for a fan.  I happened to love the first 2, they were awesome, so how did this end up such a piece of garbage? For instance, he uses his super breath to freeze a lake top so he can carry it over to put out a fire.  Why didn't he just use his super breath to blow out the fire in the first place? Yeah lot of half thought stuff slapped together.

Anyway, I haven't seen Superman 4, but I hear it's the worst of the bunch. If that's the case, I'm not sure I even want to see it. So I would recommend buying Superman 1&2 separately for something like $26 total, and save your self from the collection.",1154563200,3,1096,3.936651583710407
288850,2,6300270122,"Movies like this beg many questions. One prime question that was running through my mind during my viewing of ""Superman III"" was ""How could they screw this up so bad?"" Other questions, such as ""What were they thinking"" and ""Why didn't someone tell them this was a bad idea"" also popped up sporadically. When the two previous movies were a smash and had good stories going for them (despite limited special effects) you really wonder where things went so wrong. See, it's not that the third installment in the ""Superman"" movie franchise is bad...it's completely horrible!

All the familiar cast members show up again -- from Superman himself, Christopher Reeve, to Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure, and even Margot Kidder, doing what can only be described as a ""brief cameo"" as Lois Lane. This time, Gene Hackman's brilliant Lex Luthor is substituted for a new villain (who is so forgettable, it's sad) as played by Robert Vaughn. The story itself is outright ridiculous, and I swear the script was written by an A.D.D. riddled eight-year old. Not only do we have Superman heading home for to Smallville for a class reunion, but he forgets his feelings for Lois Lane, and falls for hometown honey, Lana Lang (played by Annette O'Toole). In the midst of this, a Kryptonite substitute splits Kent in two -- one part good, one part evil -- which reduces to an admittedly amusing scene where Superman gets drunk in public and loses his temper. Eventually, he settles his differences in a Fight Club-esque manner -- which is more ridiculous than it sounds -- in order to make way for some more subplots that make absolutely no sense and go nowhere. From controlled weather changes, to a super-computer that merges itself with a woman, to a video-game being played by the villain against Superman, what happens in this movie is best forgotten. In fact, I'll be damned if I can sort any of it out. I started dipping into an insanity and boredom induced coma towards the end of it.

Put quite simply: This movie makes no sense. When it's not being outright cheesy, it just betrays the spirit of the first two movies. What a surprise, since ""Superman II"" director Richard Lester was behind the lens. Which still begs the question: What went wrong here? This should have been a good movie. No wonder nearly twenty years went by after ""Superman IV"" before we got a new movie. Movies like this do no good. I only gave ""Superman III"" the two-stars because, for one thing, Richard Pryor was entertaining in every scene, and for another, because it was a thrill to see Superman burst into a drunken rage. If you thought other franchises such as ""Batman"" and ""Star Wars"" went awfully sour after a while, perhaps you should avoid this little turd.",1153267200,6,2724,4.744725738396625
288851,2,6300270122,"...And so was whoever wrote this scipt, apparently.  I mean seriously, what the hell is this?  The story is cheesy, ridiculous, and all over the place, and more than a few parts of this are just plain embarrassing.  First of all, because Gene Hackman was unavailable (or maybe he just read the script and didn't want to attach himself to such a monstrosity), Lex Luthor is replaced by some lame imitation character (played by Robert Vaughn), who's pretty much the same as Lex, only not as good.

So anyway, this guy comes up with this crazy scheme to build this machine that somehow magically changes the weather all over the world, and meanwhile, he's also created a synthetic kryptonite to destroy Superman, but instead it only turns him evil, and eventually splits him in two.  The story culminates with two disappointingly anti-climactic scenes, the first of which includes Superman doing battle with his ""evil twin"", which could have been really cool, but instead was just goofy, with bad choreography, and even worse dialogue (there's one part where the bad Superman says something like ""Come on, chicken!""; it's hilarious, it's so bad).  And then, there's an even worse scene, with Superman ""battling"" the weather machine, which can also duplicate the effects of kryptonite.  This scene basically consists of Superman standing in front of a big box, with goofy fake-looking laserbeams coming down on him.  It's seriously like something out of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".

However, this movie thankfully isn't all bad.  The only thing I really enjoyed about it was the smaller subplot, in which Clark returns to Smallville for his high school reunion, and briefly reunites with ex-girlfriend Lana Lang (played wonderfully by Annette O'Toole).  However, in the end, Lana moves to Metropolis, and gets a job at the Planet, but in the fourth movie, they've completely forgotten all about it.  Also, Richard Pryor was entertaining as the crafty, wise-cracking computer hacker working for Crappy Replacement Lex.

But yeah, overall, this is just plain bad.  Easily the worst of them all.  Thankfully, the new Superman movie was WAY better than this (as well as the fourth).  Other than that, they really should have stopped after two.",1151971200,3,2234,5.046321525885559
288852,3,6300270122,"After the success of ""Superman II,"" the Salkinds decided to let Richard Lester do his own film (He basically was hired to ""finish"" the second movie; Richard Donner had finished 2/3 of the movie already). You could say that this was the kiss-of-death for the franchise.

""Superman III"" is by no means the worst film ever made, but it is nowhere near a classic that the first two films had been. The main plot is a bit hokey, and Richard Pryor, although a very funny and talented actor, really has no place in a ""Superman"" movie. And Lester, most famous for directing The Beatles in ""A Hard Days Night,"" seems to bring ""British"" sensibilities and humor to a genuinely ""American"" character.

However, the story with Clark Kent returning to Smallville, and most of the story dealing with Superman himself, is good. Annette O'Toole gives a fine performance as Lana Lang. And Christopher Reeve gets to stretch his acting muscles, thanks to Superman turning evil when exposed to Kryptonite laced with tar. And the scene where Superman splits in two, with good Clark Kent facing evil Superman, is genuinely entertaining.

Overall, ""Superman III"" is an average super-hero film, which will only appeal to fans of Superman. Reeve would return for one more film, the slightly better ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,"" before the end of his tenure as the Man of Steel.

288854,3,6300270122,"I've watched bits and pieces of Superman III over the years since it first came on cable back in 1984. Finally I rented the disc yesterday and got a chance to judge it.

First it was great to see the film in a widescreen presentation with good sound. The picture looked great for a film made over 23 years ago (time goes by so fast these days).

As for the film itself, it's not the disaster that so many say. I can't imagine another actor at that time playing Superman other than Christopher Reeve. He was(and many say still is)the perfect embodiment of The Man of Steel. I also thought Annette O'Toole was perfectly cast as Lana Lang. It would've been interesting to see at that time if they decided to do another one to play on the rivalry between Lana and Lois for Clark/Superman's attention.

As for the minus: I have to agree that Richard Pryor's Gus Gorman and Robert Vaughn's Ross Webster weren't that really interesting villains. I know that Gene Hackman, Terrence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran were a tough act to follow but Superman had so many other foes in is rouge gallery such as Brainiac, Toy Man and Bizzaro. It's too bad that two tremendous talents were wasted. Although Annie Ross was very fun to watch as Vaughn's sister Vera.

Also missing is the wonderful Margot Kidder. I know she and the Salkynds were at war over the firing of Richard Donner and Lois was only featured in the beginning and end of the films, but the producers had to know the chemisrty between Reeve and Kidder was extraordinary. Maybe if Lois had gone to Smallville with Clark, that would have made it much more interesting (not to take anything away from Annette as she was wonderful). Oh well.

On the whole: the film was entertaining but not as legendary and memorable as Superman and Superman II.

P.S.: I can't wait to see Superman Returns!",1151280000,16,1848,4.56797583081571

The comedy provided ala Richard Pryor and the curvaceous Pamela Stephenson was a little too much in my opinion. However Clark's return to Smallville and his reunion with Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) was enjoyable and pretty much saved this film for me.

Not the best, but it's still Christopher Reeve so why not?",1150243200,10,425,5.071428571428571
288856,3,6300270122,"After two major hit movies, the third entry in the Superman movie series was definitely viewed as a letdown. Indeed, compared to both the commercial success of the first two films as well as the quality of the films themselves, it is indeed a weak sequel. However that doesn't mean it's outright bad.

The third entry has Supemran / Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve, once again playign the aprt to perfection even if thw writing and the film itself are less than stellar) returns to Smallville, his hometown, where he hooks up with old flame Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole). Meanwhile, a down on his luck computer geek named Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) has used his keyboarding skills and with the help of an evil industrialist (Robert Vaughn), plans on buildiding his ""Super"" computer and turning it into a weapon. Of course, Superman naturally gets in their way, and now they must achieve kryptonite and get him out of the way. They do indeed achieve it, but it does not kill him. However, it splits him into two separate personalities: Clark Kent and Superman, with Supemran being the foe, Clark now must get control of his other half before it destroys him in time to stop them from destroying the world with the ""Super"" computer.

First of all, let me start off with the good aspects of the film. Reeve is once again fantastic as Superman. He manages to overcome the film's flaws and turn in another magnifificent performance. It's also nice to see Samllville revisited, and the subplot with him and Lana was nice.

Now for the bad. Richard Pryor for the most part wasn't all that great. He was a truly brilliant comedian, but he's just out of place in a Superman movie. With him in it, the film automatically becomes more of a comedy (take a look at the opening credits sequence) and he just doesn't make a great villian. Next, Robert Vaughn's Webster is one of the worst villians ever. I know a lot of people complained that Hackman's Luthor was campy and over the top, but Vaughn surpasses him by MILES. And his henchman are much more annoying than Luthor's Eve and Otis. The score by Ken Thorne is autrocious, and you automatically yearn for John William's truly astounding score from the first two films to swell up out of nowhere. Add to that a cheesy soundtrack of original songs from Georgio Moroder and it just adds to the film's campiness.

I can go on and on about more positives and negatives, but I'll just say that ""Superman III"" is worth checking out, even if you will be a little disappointed by the end.",1149811200,14,2517,4.624161073825503

Good ""Superman"" battling ""Evil"" Superman should have been premise enough to hold everyone's interest.

Half of the movie revolves around Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor!), a dim-witted computer programmer who becomes involved in crime when he begins working for millionaire Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn).  The other half of the film revolves around Superman (Christopher Reeve), as he is reunited with high school sweetheart Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) and becomes evil when exposed to synthetic kryptonite.

One can't help but wonder what David and Leslie Newman, who co-wrote the previous two SUPERMAN films, were thinking when they wrote this film.  It opens with a cringeworthy slapstick sequence, and gets worse from there.  Any and all scenes involving Richard Pryor are completely out of place in this film, making it seem more like an unfunny comedy than a superhero film.  Director Richard Lester tries his best to make the movie work, but ultimately, it doesn't, thanks in part to the absence of Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and the near-absence of Margot Kidder as Lois Lane (Kidder has a total of about three minutes on-screen).  Christopher Reeve, however, is excellent as always, and Annette O'Toole is a good fit for the part of Lana Lang; interestingly, she portrayed Clark's mother, Martha Kent, on the hit Superman TV series SMALLVILLE.

SUPERMAN III is mediocre at best, a failed attempt to continue an excellent series.

Salkind has acknowledged that he's working with Warner on the new DVDs, and that all of the films in the series are being restored and given deluxe new special edition treatment, a-la last year's Batman Anthology collection. By far the best news in all this, is that it seems that Warner is FINALLY allowing Richard Donner to create his original director's cut of Superman II! How damn cool is that?! As many of you know, Donner directed Superman: The Movie and most of Superman II back to back, but was eventually fired from the sequel. Director Richard Lester was hired to replace him, and it's Lester's cut of the film that we've seen all these years. What's cool is that Lester's theatrical cut of the film is being given special edition treatment as well, so you'll be able to fully explore BOTH versions of Superman II on DVD this summer. Lester MAY even do an interview for the DVD - something he's been reluctant to do over the years given the controversy. This information comes from Salkind via The Superman Homepage fan site, which expects to publish a full interview with Salkind in the coming weeks. Very cool news indeed (though keep in mind that until Warner announces this set, it's all still unofficial).

That is, until a shot at some on-the-job training helps him discover his  natural talent for computer programming. Suddenly, Gus is making money again, but not nearly as much as he'd like. When he learns that a fraction of a cent out of every employee's paycheck is discarded by the computers that dish out the wages, he comes up with a plan to have all that spare change paid out to his name. Soon, Gus is living high on the hog, but his carelessness makes it easy for the big boss, Ross Webster, to pinpoint the employee who's been embezzling from the company. To Gus's relief, Webster is not looking to prosecute his newfound computer genius. Instead, he puts Gus's talents to work on his plan to control the world's weather, thereby giving the already filthy rich Webster control of the world's cash crops as well!

Meanwhile, mild-mannered reporter for ""The Daily Planet"" Clark Kent convinces his boss, Editor-In-Chief Perry White, that his upcoming Smallville High class reunion would make a great story for the world-renowned newspaper. He soon finds himself on a bus with friend and photographer Jimmy Olsen, heading back to his hometown in Kansas, and making a brief stop along the way so that Superman can take care of an out of control fire at a nearby chemical plant. Once Clark is back home and reunited with his old flame, Lana Lang, at his class reunion, romantic sparks begin to fly. Clark is having a great time playing hero to Lana and her son Ricky, both in and out of his tights, and he even gets to befuddle local bully Brad from time to time too.

Webster quickly realizes that if his next plan is going to work, Superman must be taken out of the picture first. Together with his sister Vera, girlfriend Lorelei, and lackey Gus, Webster plots to kill Superman by synthetically making his own clump of Kryptonite. Unfortunately for them, upon analysis, there is an unknown element in Kryptonite's chemical make-up. Gus foolishly uses tar to fill in the gaps, with no idea of what the result will be. Then, in full military garb, Gus presents the hunk of unknown mineral to Superman at a Smallville festival in his honor. Things don't go exactly as planned, but the little deception still seems to pay off for the dastardly group. After his encounter with the strange, synthetic kryptonite, Superman begins to grow more and more apathetic. Eventually forming into outright bitterness and anger. The man of steel soon cares about no one but himself, and is miserable with contempt for his own good-natured secret identity. While the new, downright rotten Superman, clad in darker shades of red, yellow, and blue, goes about causing trouble in the world instead of saving the weak and helpless, Ross Webster and his cronies are free to put their next plan into action: taking over the world's oil supply!

Gus wants a computer, a super-computer; one that even Superman would be powerless against! And, even if Superman knew of Ross Webster's greedy plans, he first has to deal with the villain within himself!

Starring the ultimate Superman, Christopher Reeve, pitted against the nasty Robert Vaughn and legendary funnyman Richard Pryor, ""Superman III"" is an all too underrated piece of the 4 film Superman franchise of the 70s and 80s. The film is much lighter than the first two Superman films, but why does that have to be a bad thing? ""Superman III"" is far from an out and out comedy, but, in essence, harkens back to the classic corniness of the Superman TV series with its take on humor, while still being completely substantial as a contemporary feature film. One is reminded of Christopher Reeve's own statement about how he tried to play a bit of early Cary Grant in his innocent, goofball take on Clark Kent, and the humor of ""Superman III"" plays on that fact quite well. The opening credits scene with the snowballing mishaps is fantastic! With key characters reprising their roles, a focus this time on Superman's conflict with his own dual identity, and a charming homecoming to Smallville and the girl Clark Kent left behind, ""Superman III"" is a wonderful part of the film series that any true fan should enjoy! Richard Pryor is at his funniest, Robert Vaughn is pure sleaze, and even in her most wishy-washy moments, one still can't imagine how Clark let Lana (Annette O'Toole) get away. The film takes a hilarious stance on the computer revolution of the 1980s, along with the greed of the corporate world, but I'm sure it's the Clark vs. bad Superman fight that most of us remember from this classic film! As for the whole Superman vs. Super Computer thing and the lack of Lex Luthor or other recurring Superman villains, what's the big deal? Superman shouldn't face the same ol' trouble makers every outing! The theme of Superman vs. machine in this film takes me back to the old Fleischer cartoons from the 1940s! Great stuff! ""Superman III"" didn't have it easy following the fantastic first two Superman films, but it fits nicely into the franchise as another fun-filled Superman adventure! The DVD doesn't offer much in the way of extras. All you get is the theatrical trailer and some cast filmographies. Still, the film itself is a must own for fans of the last son of Krypton!

No, I can't forgive that one because that was pretty bad.  Too obvious.

I think what turned people off from this movie was the fact that it went another direction from the previous Superman movies where he was taken out of Metropolis, dealing with other villans than Lex Luthor, and having another love interest besides Lois Lane (apparently Margo Kidder was off her meds and had her part cut for her bad behavior).  I think it was pretty funny when he turned evil and bedded that bimbo myself, but I guess a lot of people didn't see it that way.  And Superman drunk?!?!  Blasphemy!  Still, it's a Superman movie and I adore Superman movies, this included.",1124841600,,1486,4.4609665427509295

288937,3,6300270122,"Well the credits at the end of Superman II warned us, Coming Soon Superman III. Well here it is, Superman III and would it be a worthy addition to the Superman saga? Well.. not exactly. But that doesn't mean it's a total loss.

There were a lot of problems with this film. Everything that was great about the first two just wasn't anywhere to be found in this edition of the movie. Richard Lester now had full control of the directors seat and the movie was turned into a total humor and childish story that just didn't seem to fit right in the Superman universe. Margot Kidder's role as Lois Lane was reduced to a few minutes at the beginning and end due to her still being steamed about the original Superman: The Movie's director Richard Donner's being replaced. The bad guy this time around wasn't Luthor but a billionaire who even though he had no reason to be a bad guy, thought it was good to just be bad with the help of computers. And the story at points was pretty ho-hum, with Clark's old flame from Smallville, Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) along with her son take the place of Lois Lane this time around. The biggest addition to this film is comedian/actor Richard Prior who played, Gus Gorman, being the main focal point that this movie would be devoted to, that could be good or bad considering if you liked the path this movie took.

Gus is an out of work bum who takes a few classes in data processing only to discover that he is a natural wiz at computer hacking. He uses this skill to steal thousands of dollars, by making the computer give his check all the half of cents that are disregarded in paychecks by the payroll computer. When the head of the company Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn) finds out about this, instead of firing him or calling the police, he decides to use this ability Gus has to tamper with computers to his advantage. Gus is sent to Smallville to gain access to Vulcan, the weather satellite and has to reprogram it to cause bad weather, rather then just report it. After ruining the coffee crops in Columbia, Superman flies in to save the day and restores all the crops and fixes the weather there, much to the disgust of Ross.

A lab made batch of Kryptonite is created and handed to Superman at a festival in his honor. Instead of killing Superman, the home made Kryptonite turns Superman twisted and selfish and evil. He is no longer the superhero the world remembers but goes around causing trouble like blowing out the Olympic Torch and pushing the leaning tower of Pisa straight again. With Superman out of the way Ross and Gus go to work by having the oil tankers aimlessly wander the Atlantic Ocean to cause oil shortages and eventually they build a master computer of Gus' design that will be able to do anything they want. Including..the ability to kill Superman.

The movie has a lot of fun moments but also leaves a lot to be desired at many other points. A lot of situations were meant to be funny or humorous but come off as silly and lame. A good example of this is when Gus is trying to get into the Vulcan satellite via a computer up-link he is busy tampering with other things in the process. So we have the Don't Walk icon getting into a fist fight with the Walk icon in the traffic cross walk light. Then we have someone's Bloomingdale's bill become hundreds of thousands of dollars and the husband pushes a grapefruit into his wife's face when he sees this. The whole opening sequence as well was pretty awful. A chain event of situations is caused as the main squeeze of Ross, Lorilei (Pamela Stephenson) walks through Metropolis and catches the attention of a few onlookers and hijinx ensue. In a scene that even Reeve's groaned on in real life, Gus in a pair of skies, losses control on top of the roof of a building and skies off the side of a building casually landing on the street and skies away. And on and on and on.. this movie was full of many things like this that just weren't that amusing even though they so wanted to be. A definite change of pace over what the first two films were.

But there were some pretty good moments as well. The moment that most people love of this movie is when, Superman after affected by the bad Kryptonite turns into a bad version of himself until he finally screams out in terror only for Clark Kent to show up before him as he splits into two versions of himself. The two now battle it out in a junk yard where it's Evil Superman vs Clark Kent destroying everything in their path as they try and out do the other. Christopher Reeve truly shines here as Superman playing both roles at the same time and playing both characters as if it were second nature. It's classic when Evil Superman is swinging Clark Kent around and says ""You always wanted to fly Kent, well now's your chance!"" only to send him flying into the air. Also a moment that may have actually scared a lot of people as kids was when Ross' sister Vera (Annie Ross) gets sucked into the Supercomputer at the end and becomes a robotic version of herself with all the abilities of the computer and the look to match. Superman against the computer itself wasn't as good as it could have been but still is suspenseful enough to lead to a good climax.

A lot of people say this movie killed the Superman Movies franchise but I think that while it wasn't as good as previously it isn't horrible either. It definitely lacked big time when compared to the first two, as it relied more on slapstick and uncreative moments then thrilling battles and a fun love story. I can easily see it from both perspectives. That while on one side we have Richard Prior in a ridiculous role and very unfunny moments, we also have some good Superman type elements like the man of steel flying off and freezing a lake to lift up and cause rain to fall over a chemical plant that is under fire. And some cool graphics where they have a computer like game that is being played as real rockets are being fired at Superman from the supercomputer. If you look past the bad jokes and sight gags and see what it does have , you will find a not to bad edition of Superman here.

Overall I say why not add this? Ok maybe it's not the best movie to ever have the Superman name on it, but you can do a lot worse and it is funny to at least relive the past and the early 80's through this film. It has the token annoying little kid, and the rich guy wanting to get richer at any costs and the bully from High School too. But it also has a certain charm and fun factor that I can't quite put my finger on. For some reason it's just fun to watch this movie. It's not often you will see a pretty girl sitting atop the Statue of Liberty and have Superman come in saying he won't save her ""Cause he doesn't do that anymore"" only for her to make seductive passes at him.

Check it out, it's good for a laugh, and not only due to the jokes that fill this film. Trust me, it's really not as horrible as it could have been. The Italian guy in Pisa who breaks the Tower of Pisa figurines due to Superman making the Tower straight thus making his leaning figurines worthless, is just classic Superman humor. You can't make this stuff up.",1120780800,,7159,4.3532934131736525
288938,2,6300270122,"Warner Brothers apparently doesn't know how to tell when a franchise is about to fail with the release of one terrible installment.  It seemed the Superman franchise was destined for greatness from the beginning with A-list director Richard Donner leading the way for the Man of Steel's adventures on the big screen; however, after Donner's replacement during the filming of ""Superman 2"" by director Richard Lester things quickly went down the tubes.  ""Superman 2"" though not completed by Richard Donner, it was still an excellent film that expanded wonderfully upon the original.  Sadly, though this greatness was not destined to continue as ""Superman 3"" would all but kill the man of steel's further adventures on the big screen.  One can only wonder why the ""powers that be"" at Warner Brothers would allow this terrible movie to make it to theaters let alone be completed during filming.  Everyone would have been better off if this particular version of ""Superman 3"" would have been scrapped and replaced by something better, I mean with Superman having adventures in the comics since 1938 there really is not a shortage of material for earth's greatest hero.

""Superman 3"", also known as the worst Superman film ever to be made, finds Superman (played again, to his credit, by Christopher Reeve) falling under the influence of a manufactured Kryptonite which brings out his dark side and instead of helping people he causes pain and suffering.  Now, this premise sounds like it holds the promise of being a great film, which may be how Warner Brothers thought it was a good idea to let people see this movie.  Instead of being a serious exploration of Superman's darker side, we are left with basically a comedy film, wrapped in Superman's classic colors.  Richard Pryor, who by the way never should have been allowed near this franchise, plays one of the films crappy, worthless villains.  Many of the first two films characters are not seen here or merely make cameo appearances; such as, Margot Kidder as Lois Lane and Marc McLure as Jimmy Olsen.

One great thing this movie did have in it was a very entertaining fight between Clark Kent and dark Superman, somehow they were split into two beings (I don't remember how this happened, not that it matters).  This fight happens about two-thirds into the film, though how I got this far in this movie is beyond me, it is the best scene in the movie and it's interesting to see how the goodness of Clark Kent allows him to overcome the all-powerful evil Superman.

A terrible film, surprisingly though this did not fully kill this franchise but it came really close though.  It was another four years before ""Superman 4"" was released to theaters.  This is the reason that the currently in production ""Superman Returns"" picks up after the events of ""Superman 2"" and completely ignores ""Superman 3"" and ""Superman 4"".

""Superman 3"" is rated PG for violence and language.",1120089600,2,2922,4.884615384615385
288939,4,6300270122,"Paradox rules life, reminded permanently to us in many of his novels and fables the satyric journalist,essayist and novelist G.K.Chesterton. And a paradoxal luck seems to have fallen over the second sequel for the big screen about the famous character. Directed by Richard Lester (""A hard's day night"",""The knack and how to get it"",""Help"",""The bed-sitting room""), Superman III is the solid proof that an intelligent and talented director can build a good film with a poor and ridiculous character, inside a cosmetic industry as is Hollywood; and what's more important, keeping his own style. Testimony of it are the opening credits of this film, conceived as a slapstick comedy scene: Lester films a chain of visual gags and comic metropolitan ""catastrophes"" with his mocking,subversive and reflexive humour. I remember specially that one of the car that crash against a exticting fire bomb  due to the effect of a lost bullet shot for a policeman(this is, a man paid to guarantee the security of citizens)trying to catch a bank robber,and whose driver is about to drowning because the water of the bursted bomb, unable to go out of his vehicle. Parts of the plots reflects also the position of a director who likes to dynamite social myths and masks:behind the man who has been named the ""humanist of the year"",we find a corrupt and illiterate enterpriser(Robert Vaughn )who considers Atila as a model to follow and a great philosopher;a greedy man who don't like greedy people and who tries to monopolize coffee business ( and, immediately after, to control the petroleum industry ) interfering a powerful and sofisticated satellite with the purpose to provoke a climatic catastrophe that ruins the coffee plantations of Colombia ( the only country that refuse his blackmail ) with the "" help "" of a computer genius ( Richard Pryor ), one of his numerous anonymous employeers, who has been trapped trying to swindle the company with the help of a computer of the own company .It seems that Lester is interested in demonstrate, with his ironic style, the paradoxal double face of progress and science and everything that is selling us under the slogan "" in benefit of humanity ""(computers,cars,security systems conceived to serve man becomes a menace or produces the reversal function ) and in this way, as in its smart combination of action and humour,the film is very consistent. For other part,during the film the director turns down many stereotypes that are common in entertainment industry:for example,the stereotype of the fool pretty blonde,incarnated in the film by Pamela Stephenson , an intelligent woman who benefits from this topical to live without working and who likes to read cerebral books during her moments of solitude,leaving the reading of foolish magazines for her""performances"".

  Lester,also the responsible of the second part of the series, continues exploring the contradictions of the character that here divide protagonism with the character played by Richard Pryor ( one of the many trangressions of the film respect the previous two parts, but not a trangression for Lester himself:as he indicated us in the opening credits of "" A funny thing happened on the way of the forum "" our director prefers liars and clowns than the classic hero,cut in one piece, of epics) and also splits in two, the good and bad Superman, by the effect of synthetic kriptonite. Lester gives us a portrait more human of Superman than the more academic and solemn first part, directeded by Richard Donner, the responsible of one of the most uncivic film series of all time: exactly, I'm talking about the horrible "" Lethal weapon "" series. For those that defeat the first part because the best quality of visual-effects,I like to remind them than usually a bad director appeal to realism in special-effects to cover up his absence of talent; Lester probably prefers a cheap production but artistic freedom in benefit of the story and the characters, a story, in this case, narrated sometimes in a direct form because Lester don't like to bore the spectator with unnecesary information.",1119916800,,4094,5.0517751479289945
288940,4,6300270122,"The best Superman movie was the original from 1978.  From there, the films got progressively worse and more corny with each release (Superman II being enjoyable, Superman III being the one where you wonder what the producers were thinking making a third enstallment, and Superman IV being laughably cheesy and cheaply done). Still, Superman III remains somewhat enjoyable because it strayed from the norm. Unlike Superman I, II, or IV, Superman III is nearly Lois Lane-less.  Instead, Clark Kent goes back home to Smallville to see if he can't spark something up again with childhood lover Lana Lang. In additon, there is no Lex Luger.  The special effects were noticably done with a lesser budget than the ones from the first two movies of the franchise, but they don't completely ruin the film.  There's a junkyard fight scene that is particularly engaging.  And finally, although Richard Pryor was a questionable choice for this movie, he delivers some great one-liners and actually does a fine job with the role he plays.

The Best Quotation From the Entire Film:  ""I asked you to kill Superman, and you couldn't even do that one simple thing!""",1095724800,4,1148,4.947916666666667
288941,3,6300270122,"""You always wanted to fly, Kent. Here's ya chance."" - Superman has a severe identity crisis as he battles his alter ego, Clark Kent, in ""Superman III""

 The third installment to the ""Superman"" series is less than stellar (it doesn't compare to the first two films). With the origin story told in ""Superman: The Movie"" and the romance between Superman & Lois Lane explored and understood in ""Superman II"", my expectations were high for ""III"". I expected a thematic story, along the lines of the first two films, but, instead ""Superman III"" has a weak plot covered in Bob Hope style shtick that only goes so far.

 Superman goes up against Ross Webster, a greedy international conglomerate, that wants to control the world by using the world's computer resources. One of the company's new employees, computer genius Gus Gorman, is blackmailed by Webster (after balking at recieving his first paycheck, Gorman hacks into the computer main frame and gives himself a very big raise) and is forced to help destroy Superman by concocting a home made piece of Kryptonite, that instead of killing The Man of Steel, brings out the hellraiser in him. Superman has to get his s*it together & defeat Webster & Gorman in a super computer hideout, hidden in The Grand Canyon.

 Compared to the first 2 films, this is a really lame film. But, it is watchable and better than ""Superman IV"". You can tell the cast is getting a bit old for their britches in this one. Margot Kidder, showing her disgust over the firing of Richard Donnor during the filming of ""Superman II"", has about 5 minutes of screen time in ""III"", having Lois Lane vacation in Bermuda. Christopher Reeve is still great as Superman, but this time out, the feeling seems to be, ""been there, done that"". Richard Pryor seems to be stuck in first gear only generating a few laughs out of the 2 hr. film time.

 The high point for the film, for me, was the cool junkyard duel between the bad Superman and the good Clark Kent. The battle in the Grand Canyon wasn't bad either, although quite outdated (Atari graphics!?! Gimmee a break!).

 As for the DVD - 2.0 Dolby Digital (ouch), and a trailer for the special features. Save your money and just buy the first two films. Rent ""Superman III"" on a rainy day. Avoid ""Superman IV"" like Mytzlplyk (or however he spells it).",1091318400,3,2315,4.665847665847666

The story - Clark Kent/Superman goes back to Smallville for a school-reunion and meets up with a really lovely Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole). Unfortunately, there's this businessman and his bimbo girlfriend and his sister who hires Richard Pryor to mess up the world-weather (and Columbian coffee) with computers. Superman turns evil after touching some green crystal (Kryptonite mixed with tar) and gets drunk, then ends up sleeping with the aforementioned businessman's bimbo girlfriend and even pushes the Tower of Pisa straight. Finally, a supercomputer designed by Richard Pryor turns evil and transforms the aforementioned businessman's sister into an evil, mechanical sister. Superman fights them all with acid and then proceeds to make the Tower of Pisa a leaning tower again before soaring off triumphantly. Movie ends. Roll credit.
I hated this as a kid but watched it again last night and absolutely loved it. It's the nostalgia thing again. I knocked one star off my rating for it because there's this scene where Richard Pryor skies off a skyscraper, lands on the street and DID NOT die!",1085875200,5,1353,5.154545454545454
288943,3,6300270122,"Without Lex Luthor, this film rather suffers.  But it was an attempt to create an original story instead of returning to the same old theme, which, let's be honest, can get exhausting.
  This also got me interested in psychology as a child, because I thought the whole notion of two sides of the same man duking it out was fascinating, to say the least.
  Besides, Richard Pryor is a scream here, though what he does on the computer intuitively instead seems to be very close to what a skilled hacker can do today.
  This film has one other great idea:  Clarke should forget about Lois and start dating Liana.  Liana is much sweeter, and unlike the Superman-obseesed Lois, Liana only wants her old friend, Clarke?  And, she's smart enough NOT to put herself into deathtraps.",1081123200,,774,4.666666666666667
288944,4,6300270122,"The third installment in the Superman series, while not as thrilling as its predecessors, is nevertheless a fun movie to watch. It's important to know that this movie has an entirely different feel than the other two: a bit more lighthearted and without the Clark/Lois romance. The plot has Superman, fresh from defeating General Zod, going up against megalomaniac industrialist Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn). After he foils Webster's first plan, Superman gets exposed to Webster's synthetic kryptonite which turns him into an evil thug. But when Webster threatens the world using a destructive supercomputer, can the Man of Steel fight off the evil which has corrupted him to save the day?
  Comedian Richard Pryor is the bumbling Gus Gorman, a computer whiz, whose talents are exploited for evil by Webster. He provides some funny moments, but at times doesn't seem to quite fit into this kind of movie. Annete O'Toole is Lana Lang, who coupled with a spirited performance provides a great love interest. This film also had some really good scenes. The two best are the chemical fire and the junkyard duel between Superman and Clark Kent (wait and see why!!).

288945,4,6300270122,"I just rented the VHS copy of this movie for my sons, (ages 13 and 15) who have never seen this film before, and what a blast it was.  Their comments, aside from their laughter, were, ""How cheap was that?"" and ""That was corny!"" referring to the special effects.
  However, I know deep down, they actually enjoyed the movie since they stayed in the room the entire time with their eyes glued to the set.  Of course they are going to notice and laugh at the special effects, the film was made over 17 years ago.  Their comparing the f/x to the latest Hulk, Spiderman, and Star Wars films.  Thats what they have come to expect.  I would critisize this film too if it was released last year.
  I first saw this film on a date with my fiance' and I thought it was far better than Superman II.  I didn't like Margot Kidder cast as Lois Lane to begin with.  I thought she was much to unattractive for Reeves, and her part much to large in #II.  I am probably the only person to think this but, I liked Lana Lang, (Annette O'toole) much better as Clark Kents love interest.  For this reason I liked the very small part Kiddder had in this film.  Richard Pryor was good as the unsuspecting villian and comic relief.
  What super-power should Superman tangle with in this film?  He has already battled evil genius, Lex Luther, and 3 former inhabitants of Krypton with physical powers like his own.  Why not fight himself?  The synthetic Krypton that causes this sickness or multi-personality disorder in Superman is a great idea.  Theres no better way to evolve the story line.  How many times have any of us struggled with good and evil within ourselves.
  The evil super-computer at the end was good too. Can anyone say ""Terminator III"".
  Overall, I love this movie and rank it 2nd in the series with #II and IV battling for last place.  Of course the first Superman will remain everyones favorite.
  Just to let you know, after the movie was over, my 13 year old asked if we could get a copy of our own.  ""Sure thing."" I said.  I thought it was like an old friend coming to visit.",1078617600,2,2074,4.381578947368421

It takes time out from all of the husstle and busstle of the city and goes home. I know Lois is hardly in it, true, but isn't it refreshing to see more of characters we hardly see,like Lana?
My favourite character in this was Vera, played by the lady with a deeply sexy voice, Annie Ross. Despite having a childhood crush on her I thought Annie brought a refreshing humour as a villianess and overshone Vaughn's character her brother.

If only they would have further explored the relationship between Clark and Lana, and the Superman vs. Clark Kent story (the superman vs. kent sideshow is actually my most favorite part of all the superman movies, which is prob. why i give it 3 stars. i'd give it 2 1/2 if I could.)",1062201600,,430,4.430379746835443
288991,3,6300270122,"Ok, ok, so it's NOWHERE near as good as the original, but it really isn't as bad as everyone says. True, the opening sequence is WAY over the top, and needless to say, STOOPID, and Lois Lane is missed, and the villains are second rate(the evil superman was cool though) and the music is out of place. All that aside, the movie was good enough. The plot is pretty simple: outta work schmuck (Pryor) discovers a knack for computer programming and is recruited by slimy corporate bad guy (Vaughn, as pretty much a Lex Luthor rip off) to do all sorts of nasty things, such as hack into weather satelites, steal world oil supply, create synthetic kryptonite (which is the same thing as red kryptonite, just not red) and build a giant super-computer (which is pretty much the same thing as brainiac, especially when it transforms one of the villains into a cyborg, a scene I remember from when I was a kid because it was scary).  Along the way Superman goes to Smallville, saves a chemical plant, romances Lana Lang (O'toole), defeats Brainiac, defeats evil self and, surprisingly, sleeps with bad guy's bimbo. A few things could've made the movie a lot better if 1)Lex Luthor was in it 2)Lois Lane was in it for more than 5 minutes 3)the comedy was toned down a lot 4)the red kryptonite was actually red 5)the computer was actually brainiac. The fight between Clark and evil Superman is also great, even though it could've been a little better if they had taken more advantage of Reeve's great performance. That aside, the dvd is pretty standard, with only the trailer and widescreen. Still, it's worth a look if you're a Superman fan, it should bring back memories from your childhood, or it did for me anyway, considering I was young when it came out.

288992,5,6300270122,"In my opinion, i'd say this is the best one. The plot: Computer genius Gus Gorman {Richard Pryor} is hired by criminal mastermind Ross Webster {Robert Vaghan} to take on and kill Superman {Christopher Reeve} by exposing him to a different form of krytonite: red krytonite. Instead of killing him, it turns him evil. The special effects are awesome, and the fight scenes are cool too, including the junkyard fight between where it's Clark versius Evil Superman. The other cool part in the movie is when the super-computer gets a mind of it's own and turns Webster's sister into a cyborg. Like I said, This is best superman movie.

288993,1,6300270122,"I enjoyed the first two Superman movies a lot. The first one was pretty cool if you didn't mind the language. The second one, Superman grew darker in my mind because ditched his super powers to sleep with Lois Lane. (Whatta creep!)
I'd been warned about Superman III some, but NOT ENOUGH. This movie is an absolute ruin of the Superman genre. Richard Pryor ruined it with his stupid humor, and the opening slap-stick junk was a pretty good indication of the rest of the movie. It had some potential...Superman being turned nassssty with the kryptonite, and being split into a duel self could have been done so much better, but generally I liked the junk yard encounter. It was an old, split-screen trick, but pulled off convincingly.
The bad Superman corrects the Leaning Tower of Pisas lean, and helps the bad guy of the film to cripple the oil supply of the world. Then he goes and sleeps with the ditz of the movie, basically a Ms. Tetsmacher clone of Superman I.
The movie stunk. Bad language, sexual dialogue, implications, and innuendo (Perry White tells Jimmy a good reporter eats with his camera, sleeps with his camera, and Lois groans and says ""Oh, I'm glad I'm a writer."" is an example), and total stupidity.

Is it really a big deal that Superman III does not include Lex Luthor or much of Lois Lane for that matter? I thought this movie had a good bit of humor in it. Sure, Richard Pryor has probably had better roles but he did not do a bad job playing his character in Superman III. It was kind of neat seeing Clark Kent fight his opposite personality. The cyberwoman thing was not a big deal but it was somewhat interesting to watch that lady get turned into an outer cyborg of some sort. Come on people! Give Superman III one more chance.

This film is just painfully ruined by the slapstick humor approach that director Richard Lestor and screenwriters David & Leslie Newman threw in. Plus, using the movie to practically showcase Richard Pryor's comedic skills is just absurd. These factors ruined the movie. I never liked Richard Pryor's character Gus Gorman being a computer genius who creates the super computer plot at all, nor the film's bad guys either, like Robert Vaughn's character Ross Webster. They just never thrilled me.
Plus sides of this movie include scenes with Annette O'Toole playing Clark Kent's old high school sweetheart Lana Lang, Superman stopping the fire at a chemical plant, the evil Superman, and the dual battle between the good Clark Kent and the evil Superman at the junkyard are the only things that were good about Superman III.

  There was humour in the first two Superman films and genuine warmth. But here it's just turned silly.
  Gone is Gene Hackman's delightful comic Luthor. Also MIA are the menacing Phantom Zone bad guys. And worse of all, Kidder's Lois Lane makes the briefest cameo. Instead, we have Richard Pryor and Robert Vaughan as the bad guy (a hapless character and a hapless actor). [Superboy girlfriend Lana Lang isn't as bad an addition, although oddly the same actress would play Superman's mother in the 2001 Smallville TV series.]
  This illogical, tired, campy script is like the kiss of death to the franchise. Richard Donner and Tom Mankewicz kept the first  one-and-half films from descending to this level.
  And Christopher Reeve ... fine enough, given the inferior material he had to work with. And what is really a supporting role in Richard Pryor film.

Meanwhile, an unlikely computer genius (Richard Pryor) is recruited by an unscrupulous industrialist (Robert Vaughn) to reprogram a weather satellite so that it can create disastrous weather that will effect commodity prices. When Superman foils their scheme, the bad guys try to synthesize kryptonite to destroy him, but they get the process wrong so it instead splits Superman's personality into good and evil halves.
The plot and tone of the film is reminiscent of some of the sillier ""Superman"" comic books of the 1950s and 60s. Reeve gives another good performance as Superman and Clark Kent, and even gets to stretch as an actor by playing a Man of Steel with a bad streak. As a love interest, O'Toole is a pleasing alternative to Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, who only has a cameo. But they cannot save this disappointing mess of a movie, which suffers from a miscast Pryor, the absence of a compelling story or villains, and too many jokes which are simply unfunny.",1011484800,,1246,5.053398058252427
289031,2,6300270122,"Although I thought `Superman III' was kinda dumb, I also thought it had potential that was never realized. Sure, it featured many moments of goofy slapstick and more than a few stupid sight gags (e.g., the walk/don't walk signal fisticuffs). But it showcased a few great Superman gags and concepts, like freezing the surface of a lake & then lifting & dropping it on a raging chemical plant inferno.  There were also the cutesy moments that were kinda cool in their own way, like Clark helping to improve the bowling score of his high-school crush's son. Then there were those truly bizarre & somewhat surreal moments, like the ""bad"" Superman splittin' into two personalities, then both of `em dukin' it out in a junkyard. But topper to the list of the many pretty good ideas that were realized here is the fraction-of-a-cent computer program scam, which I believe was based on a real-life program! And, as most cult-flick geekoids are aware, this little high-tech scam would pop up again in the 9-to-5-world satire `Office Space'!
Sadly, this potential was bogged down by quite a few not-so-great gags & concepts, as well as poor execution of some of the better ones. Who could forget the ridiculously overdone silliness of the opening credits sequence? Or the turned-evil Supes that commits such heinous acts of mischief as straightening out the Tower of Pisa and blowing out the Olympic torch? And let's not forget co-star Richard Pryor, whose presence in a flick usually was a kiss of death back when he was still relatively lucid. His familiar weirdly-stammerin'-whilst-scared-stiff routine doesn't do much to lift this Big Blue outing from the depths of cinematic mediocrity. And his character's change from a total slacker loser to a super-hacker in an instant kinda stretches the plausibility a bit too far, even for a superhero yarn!
Still, even with all these problems, I do somewhat enjoy viewing this flick on occasion, if for nothing more than the cheese factor. And besides, as bad as `Superman III' is, it doesn't even come close to the horror of `Supe IV'! So if you ever have a hankerin' for a dumb-yet-somewhat-entertaining superhero flick, the silliness and camp of this particular celluloid nightmare just might hit the spot!

I am the Superman fan so it was a big deal for me and it needed to be a little more - lot more - sincere. The villains were comedians, the subplots were less than engaging, in fact the only good thing were the action sequences and Reeves' affable charm as the innocent Clark and the MoS. Pryor should not have mugged so much, the Producers should not have been so desperate to make a few bucks on the franchise that they would neglect their core constituency. I can only hope that the next attempt at Superman will remind us of the 1978 original and not anything after Superman 2...",1009065600,,724,4.41044776119403
289033,1,6300270122,"Saying Superman 3 is a huge disappointment is a major understatement. This film will go down in history as one of the all time worst disappointments in film. The Salkinds obviously had no idea what to do with this movie. In the film, Robert Vaughan plays a criminal mastermind who hires computer specialist Richard Pryor to help him take control of the world and to stop Superman. As everybody has already said, what is the point of having Richard Pryor in this?. It doesn't make any sense and it doesn't work. Robert Vaughan, however, is passable as the evil villain. Christopher Reeve, once again, does his usual bang up job as Superman and Clark Kent. He is the saving grace for this film. Margot Kidder, as Lois Lane, takes the backseat in this movie. Her role can almost be considered a cameo. How can the filmmakers take a classic character like Lois, and a classic couple like Lois And Clark, and do this to them?. What were they thinking?. Annette 'O' Toole(who now plays Clark's mom on the excellent new WB show ""Smallville"")plays Lana Lang here. She is very adequate in the role. The one great thing about this film is Superman turning evil. It was a great, and only, dynamic to this dud. The fight in the junkyard between Superman and Clark is priceless. A real gem. If only the rest of the fillm had that. It sadly doesn't. The end climax with the cyborg lady gave me nightmares when I was little. She scared me!!. Okay, enough of that. Well, this is a total mistake. It scarred the series. Superman IV would be better, but still not good enough to save this classic series.

Everything else is a flop.",1001808000,,91,4.75
289083,1,6300270122,"Not long ago, I wrote my ideas as to what SUPERMANs III and IV should have been for Superman Cinema's fan-fic section. My version of SUPERMAN III picked up where the last film left off, with the relationship between Lois and Clark/Superman dead and gone. In it, Lana Lang returns to rekindle her relationship with Clark while a pair of insane government scientists mass-produce Bizarros for use as a disposable army. Spurned on the basis that such an army would violate human rights, the scientists use the Bizarros to wreak havoc upon Washington and end up in direct conflict with Superman.
Why am I telling you this? Because what I came up with was way better than the actual SUPERMAN III. It's no secret that the Salkinds originally intended the SUPERMAN films to be camp comedies, a plan that Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz undid when they made SUPERMAN as a dramatic film. Even though both men had been fired from SUPERMAN II after filming 80% of the picture and replaced by Richard Lester and the Newmans (who rewrote and reshot much of the final film, and are the ""masterminds"" behind III), enough of Donner and Mankiewicz's influence was stamped into the film to keep it from being totally screwed up. With SUPERMAN III, Donner and Mankiewicz's influence is completely absent, and we finally see what the Salkinds intended the SUPERMAN series to be all along. And what we get is a campy, dumb, and unfunny insult to the mythos. Not even the superb FX work, a good rescue scene at a chemical plant, and Robert Paynter's comic book-panel photography can make this film feel like genuine Superman.
It's not the idea of having Richard Pryor in a Superman film that makes this film bad, or using Lana Lang. It's not even the idea of using new villains. What makes this film bad is the sheer carelessness and idiocy of it all. For a film that revolves around computers as a menace, the villain should have been Brainiac, the genocidal AI of the comic books. Instead we get Robert Vaughn and Annie Ross as greedy tycoons who sucker a computer wiz into helping them corner the commodities market. Not very exciting. Instead of giving Pryor a meaty, serious role that would have tested him as an actor and have fit into the tone of the Superman mythos, we get Pryor as Gus Gorman doing standard Pryor shtick and not being funny at all. Instead of Lana Lang having some zest and excitement to her, we get a very bland and dull character played by a very boring Annette O'Toole. It also doesn't help that Pamela Stephenson's Lorelai character is beyond annoying, that none of the plot threads are remotely satisfying, that Superman is now a bit player in his own movie, that Ken Thorne's abysmal and boring score continues to reduce John Williams' powerful fanfares to shrill and campy disgraces, that Richard Lester's disdain for Superman shows in his indifferent direction, and that the acting is all-around awful. Even when Superman ISN'T evil (and the ""Superman goes evil and fights himself"" scene is the lowest point in the film), Christopher Reeve comes off as smarmy and insincere. And let's not forget the horrible slapstick gags, which are totally out of place here. And why does Metropolis have such a strongly British feel to it in the opening sequence? Shouldn't it be more American?
I can't say that this is as low as the SUPERMAN films can sink; the upcoming SUPERMAN LIVES promises to be even worse. But of the Christopher Reeve cycle, this is by far the worst of the four. To those who assert that this film is truer to the comic books than the first two, I beg to differ. The first two films are kin to the best Superman comic stories. III is kin to the absolute worst.",1001030400,5,3686,4.663594470046083
289084,4,6300270122,"Hi... I am a BIG superman fan. I just got the Complete Superman Collection on DVD. I loved the first two as most people cause you could feel (specially in the first one, although I really enjoyed the second one... Donner's direction anyway) the Superman Legacy flowing from start to end, you could feel these movies where made to tell a story, not to rip of money. This 3rd installment IS a good movie. Let's see why: - It has good special effects (although you CAN see wires... by BAD effects I would mean Superman IV - It has good sequences. - If you're a Superman fan it's a must have. - Superman vs. Clark >> AWESOME! - Clark going back to Smallville. - Christopher Reeve's natural flying acting, you'll believe he does fly.
Now to its flaws:
- Richard Pryor... he doesn't belong here. - If one says Superman 1 & 2 you really get a picture of Superman in your mind, if one thinks about Superman 3... you don't. - It seems this movie was made as a comic relief barely featuring Superman... - You don't get the same feel as the first two... the beggining scene has a completely different theme and opening credits. - THE ENDING WITH CYBERWOMAN!!... I just hated that and was totally unnecessary. I mean TOTALLY. It ruined the ending for me and brought the movie down as well. - Special effects ARE GOOD, although they could have removed the wires as in the previous films, cause you can see wires almost anytime here. (I'm a 3D / special effects animator so I know how it works!) But not that big... the scenes where done perfectly and Christopher Reeve is a unique Superman, he fly-acts very naturally.
All in all, I REALLY enjoyed the movie... although the ENDING was a bit lame. If they would've removed the Cyberwoman scene it would've been GREAT. IT DOES NOT have the same feeling as the first two, but what the hell, at least it's no Superman IV.",997315200,3,1854,4.439882697947214

They thought that he could play some kind of a comic villain in Superman 3, but that sadly turned this movie, that could have been an all time classic, into a Richard Pryor comedy. Anyway there are also a few scenes that that will be rememberd for a long time. Buy this movie to see the Superman vs Evil Superman scene!",994204800,,493,4.428571428571429
289086,3,6300270122,"How do you take a growing franchise and suffocate it?  You fire the director who did a great job and hire another director to muck it all up!  That being said, I don't hate Superman III, it just pales in comparison to the first two Superman movies.  Why the heck would you write up a sceenplay about a computer nerd who invents a killer computer bent on controlling the world, when there are so many great super villains available for Superman to take on?!  It just doesn't make sense to me.  I think the evil ""Darkside"" character from the comic books would've been a perfect choice instead.  What were these guys smoking when they wrote this?
Yes, Richard Pryor has some funny moments, particularly the scene when he gets Brad, the security guard, drunk so he can access the Smallville computer to destroy the Columbian Coffee Crops.  But in order to use the computer, two cards must be inserted simultaneously and no one person can reach both by themselves, so Pryor grabs Brad, drags him to the computer room, rigs his hand with yo-yo string so that he can put both cards in at the same time.  It's insane but I still laugh at it each time I see it.  Unfortunately, other scenes with Pryor are ludicrous.  The worst is when he falls off the top of a tall building on skis, yet is able to make it to the ground unscathed.  Every time I look at this scene I say, ""He would've been killed!"".  Richard Pryor is a very funny comedian, but a lot of this material is beneath him.
The best scene of the whole movie isn't the climax with Superman versus the Super Computer.  No, it's the great scene involving Superman vs Clark Kent!  After being exposed to a substance similar to, but not exactly like Kryptonite, Superman begins to change into an uncaring slob.  But the guilt inside him begins to brew and soon Clark Kent imerges from inside him, ready to take on and overcome the evil.  Honestly, you really don't think Clark has a chance and that's easy to believe since his alterego lays into him heavily time and time again.  But Clark never gives up.  It's a really good scene and definately worth seeing.
Lois Lane is replaced by Smallville alum, Lana Lang (played nicely by Annette O'Toole).  This love story works because she's in love with Clark Kent, not Superman.  She always liked Clark.  If you recall from the 1st film, she asked him to join her with the gang but old Brad wrecked all the work Clark had done so he couldn't go.  If she had been a little more strongwilled, they may have been together back then, but then of course, it wouldn't have worked out because he would eventually leave to search for his identity.  At times I think Lana rivals Lois, because Lois loves Superman almost for his Godlike qualities and is fascinated by all his powers, where Lana just likes plain old Clark Kent.  There's something to be said about that.
No real bonus features to speak of on this DVD, except a trailer and cast & crew information.  I was also disappointed that there were no extra scenes added back into the film like Warner Brothers had done with the first Superman Movie.  You may have seen some of these scenes when Part III was shown on network television.
So, even though it's not as good as the first two chapters, Superman III still deserves a place in my DVD collection, and yours.  And don't forget about Christopher Reeve, who makes any Superman movie worthwhile.",993945600,9,3389,4.522167487684729
289087,4,6300270122,"This is really a silly comedy with Richard Pryor as the primary lead and Superman as a secondary lead.  Vaughn (of ""the Man from Uncle"" fame) plays his usual suave, diabolical role as the film's true villain - albeit a transparent Lex Luthor knock-off (because, apparently, how can you have any Superman film w/o Lex Luthor???).  In any case, he uses seductive greed and bullying fear to manipulate Pryor's idiot savant character into constructing a semi-sentient super computer to destroy the Man of Steel.  Additionally, a bizarre plot device involving a manufactured form of Kryptonite by pryor's character, which although green, seems to have similar effects to the ""red"" version infects Superman - splitting his psyche into a battle of good vs. evil/Jekyll vs. Hyde.

The film is unique in the sense that it involves Lana Lang, Clark Kent's Smallville sweetheart, rather than Lois Lane I suppose.

It does seem to me that the story makes a childish adulteration of the Superman villain Brainiac with the super computer at its climax.  One could say that ""Superman IV"" attempts the same technique with villain Bizzaro (a cloned anti-Superman).

Nonetheless, although this movie is a TERRIBLE Superman film, and taints his lead image with cartoonish camp, it is still a fun movie in itself.  Just expect to be watching a Richard Pryor film with Superman included for the ride...rather than vice-versa.  You won't necessarily like this movie if you liked ""Superman I and II"",  but if you liked ""the Toy"", ""Brewster's Millions"", and ""Stir Crazy"" you will.  Unless, of course, you are happy to have any live action film with Superman (or superheroes), irregardless of plot and seriousness.

It clearly shows that Richard Donner (the director of the first feature) was definitely the sole talent behind the success of Superman.  In the documentaries featured in the DVD of the first feature, Donner emphasized the word ""verismilitude"" as the main focus of the Superman movies.  This was what made the first Superman so entertaining.  Donner was fired after the first one's release and not given credit for directing II, but he filmed much of it and clearly set the tone for how II was to be done.  This gave Richard Lester a very easy path to work on.
Superman III is the first feature without any of Donner's services, and the result is a complete disaster.  Gone is Donner's verismilitude and what's left is lame attempts at dumb humor scene after scene.  What is Richard Pryor doing in a Superman movie anyway?

It went down the route Richard Donner spoke of avoiding with the first movie and obviously Richard Lester thought he would break away from it all together and try to tickle our funny bones with the use of Richard Pryor (who was hot property at the time) and Robert Vaughn. It takes us back to smallville which is great but one can't help feeling Lois Lane is dreadfully missed as Clarke gets all cosy with his old flame from high school. There are some great moments here esp. the battle between Clarke and Superman which is certainly this movies saving grace because as a sign of things to come it is clearly becoming unhinged from the first two movies.  Compared with what was to follow though, number IV made this look like Schindler's List. There is basically enough to keep the Superman fan happy but only just.",990316800,,960,4.517241379310345
289143,2,6300270122,"Indeed, why give the movie 2 stars?  Because of one of its two saving graces...it was better than the horrible acting and story of Superman IV.
It was a movie that might have been better titled ""Richard Pryor and Superman, Live"" without the cheap, bad humor that is normally found in a Richard Pryor concert.  (Aside:  I always felt Eddie Murphy was funnier at any rate.)
The menace any villain may have had is completely undercut by the humor.  In fact, the only menace--its other saving grace--I felt was the evil Superman vs. good Superman.  That scene was pretty classic and should have placed in a more serious story.  After all, who would have known that cigarettes not only cause cancer but bad Kryptonite, too?  What would adding milk instead of tar done?  Given Superman an evil Supercow to fight with?
Some of the effects were kind of cool--a notable favorite is the bubble that surrounds Superman, depriving him of air.  However, it just leads to another fallacy that has disturbed me often...if air is such a problem, then how does Superman manage to hurtle an elevator out into space in Superman II and fight the hideous acting...er...monstrosity called Nuclear Man in Superman IV?  Does he hold his breath?  Pretty Super Lungs there, pal.
Admit one thing though--wouldn't you have loved to have a Superman game on an Atari or Commodore that featured you firing missiles at Superman?
Seriously, just watch Superman I and Superman II, two movies that bookend each other nicely and don't leave you hanging for another sequel.  Forget that III and IV were ever made and you'll enjoy the ""complete"" story quite well; the one that Mario Puzo envisioned as complete at any rate.",989971200,,1685,4.8125
289144,3,6300270122,"Once in a while, a movie comes along that isn't what it was expected to be, and is unfairly criticized for it.  ""Superman III"" is just such a movie.  It's not a great film.  In fact, it's far from it.  But it's not the terrible film it's supposed to be either (that would be ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" - a complete misfire and total waste of time.)  In ""Superman III"" a computer programmer (Richard Pryor) is hired by a generic villain(Robert Vaughn) to use his vast computer knowledge (the movie is a bit dated - everyone is in awe of these newfangled computers) to make him rich (crashing the stock market, etc.) The only problem: Superman keeps saving the day.  So, the villains do what any good villain has to do: try to kill Superman.  They do this by generating their own kryptonite, but they get the recipe wrong: their kryptonite makes Superman a mean-spirited, apathetic slob.  He straightens the Leaning Tower of Pisa, he makes passes at women, etc.  This leads to a truly great scene in which Clark Kent separates himself from the bad Superman and they fight it out at a junkyard.  I won't spoil who wins the battle, but keep in mind that they did make a sequel.  The movie also has a nice subplot in which Clark Kent goes back to his hometown of Smallville for a high school reunion, where a  romance with Lana Lang(Annette O'Toole) ensues.  By the way, Margot Kidder does nothing but a cameo in this one as Lois Lane.  I'm just guessing, but could this be because she was embarrased about the steamy scenes she did with Pryor in ""Some Kind of Hero""? Maybe, maybe not, but it sure makes for interesting speculation.  The DVD transfer is decent, and you do get it in widescreen, which is always better than those ...pan-and-scan VHS copies.  However, there are no special features save for a trailer.  This is troubling because according to Leonard Maltin, several minutes of footage were added when this movie premiered on network television.  So where are these extra minutes on the DVD? I would have liked to at least seen them included in a deleted scenes section.

289145,2,6300270122,"Conceived as a vehicle for comedian Richard Pryor, Superman III is the least successful of the series.  Despite a somewhat prescient storyline dealing with the use of computers to manipulate the economy, the script has no depth and very little entertainment value.  Margot Kidder's Lois Lane has been reduced to a brief walk-on part, and the rest of the cast appears to be merely going through the motions.  Even Christopher Reeve, who was reportedly very angry about the producers treatment of Kidder, is lacking his usual charm.
The visual effects are not on the same level as in the previous two movies: models blatantly look miniature, most of the flying sequences look two-dimensional, and there are numerous instances of visible wires...  In short, there is none of the epic-scope that marked the first film and most of the second. ...the final confrontation between Superman and the supercomputer is flat out boring--looking as if it has been lifted from a cheap 1950s science-fiction movie.  Lester's Metropolis scenes lack the razzmatazz of Richard Donner's scenes in Superman I.

Anyway, I saw both, and when I watched Superaman III, I thought the comedy was tailored for numbskulls. I didn't laugh once.  Best scene: the fight between the evil Superman and Clark Kent in the scrapyard. That's it.

What a pleasant surprise I recieved!  Despite a weak plot and the absence of Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor, I found myself loving this movie.  When I was little, I took the ""evil-Superman"" subplot seriously.  Now that I'm an adult, the concept of a drunk Superman picking up on chicks and trashing a bar is just hillarious.  Christopher Reeves' portrayals of the evil Superman, good Superman, and Clark Kent are all perfect.  Also, I noticed a lot of the flying and blue screen effects in Superman II were really awful and distracting, so I'm happy to say that the effects are much more seemless in Superman III.  The first Superman movie is obviously the best, but Superman III is in my opinion slightly better than Superman II, and way better than Superman IV: The Quest For Money...er, I mean Peace.",989193600,,958,4.56140350877193

Then something happened that I can't fully explain. For some reason I watched the movie a second time...and a third...and a fourth...the off-beat humor and storyline seemed to get better with each repeated viewing.
This movie is now one of my favorites in the Superman series. Richard Pryor is a comic delight, and Christopher Reeves is superb as always. A scene in which a deranged Superman straightens out the Leaning Tower of Pisa (much to the chagrin of the Pisa souvenir stand operator) never fails to bring a smile to my face.
If you take the Superman legend seriously, avoid this movie. If, on the other hand, you have fond memories of the 60s version of ""Batman,"" give Superman III a try. You might be pleasantly surprised.
This being said, I will not be purchasing the DVD. Warner's has chosen to release only a 2:35 anamorphic transfer of the film. This will no doubt look superb on a large-screen digital set, but such transfers look pathetic on standard NTSC. The DVD player must perform its own ""letterboxing"" for such a transfer if you don't have the proper set, and this degrades the image even more.
Warner, how about releasing a full-frame version for those of us who can't afford a state-of-the-art setup, and have no desire to sit three feet from the screen?",988848000,6,1468,4.73828125

When Superman III came along they couldn't really fire Reeve (the star) so they wrote Kidder out of the story to punish her for mouthing off. Without the Lois Lane/Superman love story, the film had no heart in it at all. Then, director Richard Lester did with Superman III what he really wanted to do with Superman II all along, and that was make a slapstick comedy. This undermined the whole Superman theme and made a joke out of the franchise.

In fact, ""Superman III"" is among one of the most entertaining sequels in the whole series compared to the first two, but nothing can beat the first film! Yet, I regret the filmmakers not casting Gene Hackman in this one, but that's all right because Hackman probably needed a break from all of this anyway. It is also exciting to see Christopher Reeve facing off against himself in this film. It's Superman vs. Alter Ego, Clark Kent!! Of course, we did not see more of Margot Kidder in this one because of Annette O'Toole stealing the spotlight, but still, that does not make ""Superman III"" a bad film.

289162,2,6300270122,"Aside from Christopher Reeve's fine performance once again as Clark Kent/Superman, ""Superman III"" was a major disappointment back in 1983.  I remember sitting in the theater as a 10-year-old and thinking, ""Is that all there is?""  Superman vs. a Supercomputer just cannot compare with him rescuing California from a major tectonic disaster or duking it out above Metropolis with three Kryptonian villains.
I also could never understand why the producers cast Richard Pryor.  It's like he bumbled onto the set accidently from a different movie.  He's a very talented comedian, yes, but exactly what audience were the Salkinds aiming for?  I know I wasn't old enough then to see his concert movies or his vehicles with Gene Wilder.  Mind boggling to me.
I missed the magic and awe I felt during the original film.  I missed Lex Luthor's scheming ways.  But mostly, I missed the witty relationship between Clark Kent/Superman and Lois Lane.  Annette O'Toole is lovely, but her character simply wasn't as fun or interesting as the best girl reporter in Metropolis.  With her husky voice and hilarious manic energy, Margot Kidder was absolutely perfect.  Two small scenes were not enough.
I really don't like leaving negative reviews, but as a Superman purist, the only REAL Superman movie to see is the orginial.  Richard Donner's vision for the film was flawless.  The first sequel was fine, but it could have been sooo much better had Donner been allowed to finish (he was unjustly fired after the Salkinds worked him to the bone).

they also like to say the special effects are disappointing. well, sorry, but the sfx in this one are also just as good as in the first 2.
and about lois lane only being in this one for 2 short scenes, so what! i mean, no offense to margot kidder, but does anyone actually watch the ""Superman"" movies because of her?  Personally, i think this movie is better than the other 3 in the series partly because she's not in this one most of the time.  i think any guy can agree with me when i say that i'd rather see anette o'toole playing the role of clark kent's love interest than margot any day.
people also talk about this one's comedic moments as though it were a bad thing.  again, who cares.  personally, i don't think i could take another straight forward dramatic superman movie. don't get me wrong when i say that, i thougt parts 1 and 2 were both good movies but let's face the facts, it really was time for a series make over.
generally speaking, i'd have to say that all things considered, ""Superman 3"" is by far the best in the series and should not be missed.
if you want to skip part 4, though, feel free...it really does suck. for more info on that fiasco, read my review ""super dud"".

Did this movie have ANYTHING going for it?
One thing, and one thing alone:  the Superman vs. Clark sequence is extremely entertaining from a fantasy perspective.  However, whereas Richard Donner (the FIRST movie) kept one foot in reality and one in fantasy, director Richard Lester decides to take us on an acid trip into mediocrity with what, in my opinion, is the SECOND-WORST movie of all time!

The look and feel of the movie are still very Superman-like (as opposed to Superman IV where the effects are beyond cheesy and cheap-- it looked like they used cardboard cut-outs to make Supes fly in IV).  Admittedly, Richard Pryor is painful to watch in this film, however there are some really neat scenes which make this film exciting and worth watching, most notably the scene where Superman battles Clark Kent. Its a weird premise, but a thrill to watch.  It's a very exciting and well-executed fight which alone makes the film worth it.  Also Supes confrontation with the super-computer/cyborg at the finale is the stuff of little kid's nightmares (that's how it was for me when I first watched this as a young child).  Also we get to see more of Smallville and Lana Lang.

That is to say, Superman the Movie and Superman II have a clear continuity in their events and results. Such is virtually absent from Superman III. In addition, Christopher Reeve doesn't even appear to be trying to recapture that loving charm he mastered so well in the first two movies; it's though he's tired of the roll and just wants to run out the clock, so to speak. Also, while Robert Vaughn does-bearly-serve to fill Gene Hackman's shoes, Richard Pryor does not. The whole movie was poorly written, poorly presented, and poorly performed.  Now, with that all said, here is the one redeeming factor of the movie: The part where Superman is exposed to the synthetic kryptonite, becomes evil, and fights ""Clark Kent"" in the junk yard, earns this movie the three stars I give it. That lone portion of the film makes it worth watching on a lazy Sunday afternoon, or late at night-when one has insomnia.

289167,3,6300270122,"""Superman III"" is exactly the kind of movie that many feared the first ""Superman"" would be; silly and empty hearted with an overemphasis on comedy, action, loud noise and special effects.  This third Superman film sort of set the standard for the Schumaker Batman sequels.  The film isn't as bad as ""Batman and Robin"" but it still has some problems, and is ultimatly a disappointment following the success of the first two ""Superman"" epics.
The first problem is the tone of the film.  In the first two films, there was underlying humor throughout the action and fantasy.  ""Superman III"" is almost all comedy and the first sign of that is Richard Pryor as the film's villian.  Pryor is a brilliant comedian but lacks the prescence of a film villian.  He is simply the wrong choice especially considering that he follows the likes of General Zod and Lex Luthor.
Another problem is how this sequel abandons everything that was established in the first two films.  The strange romance between Clark and Lois is dropped, Lex Luthor is no where to be seen, and there is no continuation to the Superman saga.  This installment is basically an ""action sequel"" like the James Bonds or Batmans with nothing new to explore for the Superman character or mythology.  It's almost as if the producers replaced everything that made Superman work, with a trendy 80's computer villian storyline.
However, the film is not a total loss.  ""Superman III"" still magages to entertain and be quite fun.  Clark starts a sweet romance with his high school love; Lana Lang.  There is also a very entertaining development as Superman is corrupted by Kryptonite and becomes sort of a jerk and a drunk.  The result of this is a confrontation between the jerky Superman and Clark Kent???  Yes, it's strange but it is also quite exciting and one of the best scenes in the series.
""Superman III"" is not a total loss.  Overall, it's an entertaining film but it dosen't come close to the magic of the first two.  But, maybe it wasn't supposed to.  Those first two films were tough acts to follow.",976147200,2,2060,4.741573033707865

  PLOT SUMMARY:

  In this third installment, Superman is somehow turned evil by a mastermind's flunky, a computer genius named Gus Gorman. Gorman somehow finds Superman's weakness, Kryptonite, and attempts to synthesize it. This

synthetic Kryptonite seems to behave like Red Kryptonite from the comics

(despite being green): turning Superman evil and enventually splitting hi

into two people.

 Ross Webster orders the creation of synthetic Kryptonite after remembering a Daily Planet story about the last original chunk disappearing years earlier after falling to Earth. Developed by Gus Gorman, it was intended to be a copy of Green Kryptonite. After scanning the coordinates of Krypton's former location via satellite, results retur

a small percentage of an unknown component. The substitution of tar (which

Gorman used after glancing at a cigarette carton) for a crucial, but unknown, component resulted in the synthetic Kryptonite behaving like Red Kryptonite and Black Kryptonite. In this case the Kryptonite turns Superman evil and eventually splits him into two people.

  The evil Superman and Clark Kent, the embodiment Superman's remaining good qualities, then engage in an epic battle at a deserted junkyard, where Clark emerges victorious and the evil Superman fades from sight. Later in the film, Gorman's creation, the Ultimate Computer, severely weakens Superman with a Kryptonite ray before Gorman has a change of heart and attacks his own machine.

  Also in this film, Clark Kent reunites with Lana Lang, an old childhood friend. Lana is a now a divorceee with a son named Ricky. Lana's former boyfriend Brad, a former jock and Clark's childhood bully, is now a security guard and is stilly vying for Lana's attention.

  Trivia:(1)Red Kryptonite: Created from Green Kryptonite that passed through a mysterious red-hued cloud en route to Earth. Red Kryptonite inflicts random effects on Kryptonians, typically creating an initial ""tingling effect"" in those affected. No two chunks of Red Kryptonite have the same effect. Red Kryptonite effects typically last for 24-48 hours (though sometimes as long as 72), after which the Kryptonian in question is always immune to that specific chunk of Red Kryptonite. (2)Black Kryptonite: Black Kryptonite was introduced in the

""SMALLVILLE"", in the fourth season premiere episode 'Crusade', as Kryptonite with the ability to split the personality of Kryptonians. It later appears in the fourth season episode 'Onyx,' where it is revealed to split physically the bodies of humans. In the series Black Kryptonite can be created by super-heating Green Kryptonite.

289215,2,6300270122,"This is by far the worst of the SUPERMAN movies.  Oddly it's lack of quality is due chiefly to the addition of the fantastic Richard Pryor who before and since has shown considerable brilliance as a performer many  times over.  The problem is he has no place in any Superman movie.  The  character and his involvement in the plot is not only lackluster, it makes  one yearn for Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor all the more.  Added to the cast  for star power, Pryor actually chips away at any chance the movie has for  success everytime he is on the screen. The majority of the rest of the cast  are adequate to poor, although their characters are sometimes  underdeveloped.  Annette O'Toole is passable as Lana Lang (although one  wishes to see more of Margot Kidder as Lois Lane),  Robert Vaughn is  fittingly mean and greedy as Ross Webster and Jackie Cooper is again good  as Perry White.  The rest of the characters are either poorly written or  poorly portrayed or both. The only thing the film has going for it (outside  of the brilliantly staged opening) is once again Chris Reeve.  He is the  only reason for the above rating.  Not only does the script add much new  dimension to both Clark Kent and the ""Super"" dude, Reeve's  performance is more than up to the writing.  And when Superman fights his  evil twin due to a batch of faulty fabricated Kryptonite, Reeve captures  both the good and the bad so well it's sometimes hard to believe both parts  are played by the same actor. As SUPERMAN movies go this is the bottom of  the barrel but if you are a D.C. comics fan, you will at least appreciate  Mr. Christopher Reeve's fine performance.  The film is clumsily directed by  Richard Lester.",950227200,6,1698,4.556666666666667

The story has a nice  moving plot,the evil superman part was really well done.
The sfx were  great, way better than Sprmn 2 witch had crud effects at times.
The humor  at the begining is funny, but I prefer the t.v vewrsion because it has a  new begining sequence ( but they didn't cut out any scenes to do  that)
Say what you want , but this film is worth seeing",943747200,3,562,4.264150943396227
289217,2,6300270122,"Too much camp weighs down this third movie.  Christopher Reeves' performance, in combination with some good special effects, helps somewhat.  But there are too many moments of slapstick and silliness, not enough  moments of awe.  Richard Lester's directorial style seemed ill suited for  the Superman movie this time out.  It was also the first movie which did  not feature Mario Puzo's input on the story or script, and his absence is  noticable.  But for 2 hours of halfway decent entertainment it isn't too  bad.  Just not anywhere near as good as the first two, but still superior  to the next one.",941068800,5,602,4.851485148514851
289218,5,6300270122,"I really love this movie. In fact, I don't really like the firs two, they're too pompus, overblown and take themselves way too seriously. Marlon Brando as Jor-El, come on!! Are you trying to create a Godfather-epic out  of the superman mythos, or something?!
Anyway, back to this movie, I  think it's much more true to the spirit of the Superman comics. Comic  books, after all, are about light-hearted, fun and colorful entertainment,  that's part of their appeal, and this movie captures this aspect  perfectly.
Fun and light-hearted, but never silly (apart from the Richard  Pryor scenes), in ut's portrayal of Superman and his world. Especially the  relationship with Lana Lang is heartwarming and touching.
Look away from  the Richard Pryor silliness for a minute and you'll find the best portrayal  of Superman and his world they've ever made!",930960000,,849,5.0503597122302155

Think about it: THIS would have been the story of the century....

A Drunken Superman, hopped up on BAD Kryptonite..... knocks boots with a Human, and SURPRISE....she isn't DEAD.

Now.... how many of you are willing to wager (even though it's implied, very obliquely....that ROSS, LORELI, and ROSS are dead)

that Loreli...is not only NOT DEAD.... but....(wait for it)

pregnant?

With Superman's Baby!

Now THAT would be something in and of itself....but hold on...

There's a lot of you (ahem,) concerned viewers (fellow sicko's?) that are putting two and two together...

And coming up with KARA, for some ungodly Reason.... (Reason why she didn't die, maybe?)

Let me put your fears at rest.....

I have been made aware, that in the depths of the the film vault at Warners...somewhere..

There MIGHT exist....certain peculiar footage....showing  what exactly happened to LORELI....

I said MIGHT, because with how certain film stock can be handled by accident (or intentional)
it may never EVER see the light of day...

What if the name LORELI was.....a portmaneau of ""Lara LIED.....""

....

And it was URSA in a WIG?",1522022400,,1147,5.080645161290323

7807913,4,6300270122,"Superman is a Champion of the Human Race.  He fights for those who can't fight for themselves.  In every Champion's life there comes a point where he comes close to the dark side.  This movie has a synthetic, and flawed, Kryptonite bring that about in Superman.  Superman is overcome by self loathing, lust, orneriness, and bitterness.  Even wearing a dark and filthy version of his super suit. He wasn't evil, but he'd lost faith in himself and the world.

That weakened after he had an encounter with a boy named Ricky.  Ricky owed Superman his life.  Ricky had the unwavering faith, in Superman, that only a child can have.

Clark and Superman split in 2.  Though whether that's physical, or only in his mind, is unclear.  They squared off.  Clark fighting to rid himself of that wretchedness.  Superman fighting to smash, bury, or crush every bit of goodness left in him.  That ended with Clark prevailing against his Dark Counterpart.  Afterwards Clark tore open his shirt, revealing the bright colored suit.  He'd face his Dark Side and overcome it.  Superman's true colors were back.

The other main characters are Gus Gorman, Ross Webster, Ross's sister Vera, and Ross's woman Lorelei Ambrosia.

Richard Pryor's character Gus Gorman is a computer genius.  He instinctively/effortlessly does things with computers that seem impossible even to trained computer professionals.  But when it comes to dealing with society and other people, Gus was a complete and utter moron.  Embezzling money was easy for Gus.  Then he was stupid enough to buy a Red Sports Car with the stolen money.

The movie's main villain was Ross Webster.  He'd been born rich.  Financial dominance was his whole world.  He lived by the philosophy ""It's not enough that I succeed, everyone else must fail"".  Ross used Gus's computer skills to sabotage the oil companies across the globe.

Vera was a woman who clearly hated herself and the entire world.  She lived to make those around her miserable.  The last time she'd ever done something cute was when she'd been 3 years old.

Lorelei and Ross made up titles for her when needed, but she was really just his beauty.  Most people assumed she was stupid, but they were wrong. When Ross wasn't around she read about highly complex subjects.  She could have been anything she wanted, but was smart enough to know how profitable it is to be a rich man's trophy.

In return for Gus's computer services, Ross built Gus a massive computer installation, with a super computer of Gus's design.  That computer was able successfully produce a Flawless Kryptonite Beam.  Gus found his own redemption and atonement by pulling the plug on the installation and destroying the Kryptonite Beam.

Then the real horror began.  Gus's computer was too advanced.  Once activated, it wouldn't allow itself to be deactivated.  It jacked the electricity from across the states.  Blacking out half the U.S.  Many fear the day will come when machines revolt against humans, and Gus's computer was doing precisely that.

That was nothing compared to what happened to Vera.  The computer captured her, and fused technology with her.  Turning her into a hideous cyborg. The computer had remade her in it's image.  The computer was no longer her tool, she was it's tool.

Even Superman's Power was no match for that facility.  To save the world this time, Superman had to out smart a Super Computer.",1483401600,,3398,4.897887323943662
