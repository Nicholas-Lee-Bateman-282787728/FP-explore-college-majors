I've watched his movies from his early years to current, and he's like a fine wine, gets better and better with age.  This movie could have been filmed in the states, and become a #1 HIT.

4436445,4,B004NYYDT8,"Not as good as A Dangerous Man or The Keeper, but far better than Against The Dark or Attack Force. Steven does more of the actual fighting, and where a stunt double is used it is not as obvious as in those latter abysmal failures. I know it's cheaper to beep her in Eastern Europe, but really, I think it takes a toll. Not as bad as the aforemention suck-fests in which Steven's dialogue was often voiced-over by some guy that doesnt sound a bit like him. Steven would do well to cut the time down, or up the action and speed of the plot. This movie seemed to drag a bit. Going back to an ABOVE THE LAW or HARD TO KILL or MARKED FOR DEATH feel would be great. Even Out For Justice and Urban Justice moved along nicely. This one was felt a tad like The Foreigner on steroids.

Steven's character had no motivation here, and suspense was lacking for the most part. Lack of character motivation is what killed Norris and Van Damme. While overall this was a good movie, I don't think I would watch it repeatedly as I did the first four Segal movies from the 80's and 90's. They are CLASSICS and never get boring.

It doesn't take fancy graphics or car chases, just more of the STORY in which our boy, Steven, is pitted against folks who have harmed or are trying to harm him and his, and he takes care of business. Otherwise, he's just taking out the trash, as any law enforcement person does, and that is nothing worth making a movie over. Twists, sub-plots, SUSPENSE and MOTIVATION!  That is what we need more of, big guy!",1305244800,3,1521,4.2926829268292686

4436447,5,B004NYYDT8,This is a great action pack movies. Steven Seagal is awesome. I really enjoyed his movies over the years and his T.V. show. Keep up the great work Steven and keep them coming. I was on the edge of my couch all the way through the movie. Thank you for all these years.,1304035200,3,267,4.056603773584905
4436448,2,B004NYYDT8,"I wish I could meet Steven Seagal, not only to ask for his autograph but also to sit down with him and discuss what's made his recent string of movies so disappointing for even a devoted fan like me. I would use ""Born to Raise Hell"" here as an example, being sure to compliment the film's strengths but also making clear to him exactly what about it sucks. I'm not so nave to believe that Seagal is in total creative and technical control of each of his features, but perhaps I could convince him to take a more hands-on role in their production and perhaps aikido-chop the idiots who are truly responsible for the lackluster nature of some of these movies.

The plot: an international drug task force operating out of Romania, headed by ex-Interpol agent Samuel Axel (Seagal), sets its sights on bringing down the operations of a deadly and sadistic gang of drug traffickers...

People who don't like Steven Seagal by default are going to hate this movie. Seagal occupies most of the scenes (perhaps still making up for his absence throughout most of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Against-the-Dark/dp/B001MLZNKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Against the Dark</a>?) and his character is boisterous, arrogant, and most of the other characters cow to him in one way or another. Surprisingly, I found myself appreciating this: a supercilious Steven is still more fun to watch than the detached, bored-looking dope he played for a while in movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight-of-Fury/dp/B000LPR6G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight of Fury</a>. However, whatever effort he seems to have made for this film is marred by extensive dubbing of his voice - something not present in his movies to this degree since the picture I just mentioned. There aren't any other real technical snafus to be seen, but further post-production add-ins like nonstop slow motion, freeze-frame shots galore, and way too many time-killing collage scenes continue to have the movie feeling more like Seagal's trash pictures of yesteryear, moving him further and further away from the high standard he had achieved with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Urban-Justice/dp/B000VECACQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Urban Justice</a>.

The action scenes are composed mostly of boring shootouts, but there are a couple hand-to-hand encounters which, while not too flashy, feature Seagal doing just about all of his own moves and getting some good aikido throws in. There's also an impressive instance wherein he kicks a thug so hard that the man flies about six feet through the air before crashing through a bench. These lead up to the finale with martial artist Darren Shahlavi, who had been running around the rest of the picture as the necrophilic, drug-dealing main villain. This is where things get *really* disappointing, to the point of costing my rating an entire star. Shahlavi had consistently delivered great physical performances in the past, and one of his most recent movies -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ip-Man-2/dp/B004I1AGTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ip Man 2</a>, released on the same day as ""Born to Raise Hell"" - featured him in some very good fights with Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung; in this one, however, he has one very brief fight halfway through the film before getting absolutely manhandled by Seagal during the climax. The fact that Shahlavi had just been in an internationally-acclaimed martial arts masterpiece makes this ugly and one-sided encounter more disappointing than Seagal's similar exchanges with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gary-Daniels/dp/B00083FZEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gary Daniels</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Byron-Mann/dp/B0030E5PWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Byron Mann</a>: at least they didn't have any recent major successes behind them to live up to.

At this point in our conversation, if I had been able to speak freely and if the rumors concerning Seagal's temper and ego were true, I figure he'd either have left the room in disinterest or he would have me by my throat. I'd quickly try to point out that the acting is decent in general and, despite being shot in Romania, the film's cinematography is less grey than I expected and pretty fun to look at...but would this be enough to save me? It certainly isn't enough to save the movie, which I fear can be shelved along with the growing number of failed DTV outings starring the Buddhist Bonecrusher. I doubt that I'll ever actually have this conversation with Steven, but I'm still holding out on the hope that he's going to get back on the horse and make it worth being a fan of his again; right now, it really isn't.",1303603200,29,4888,5.784722222222222
4436449,3,B004NYYDT8,"Somehow, through over a decade of direct-to-video disasters, I remain a Seagal fan, hopeful there may be one last great film coming before he retires for good.  Perhaps, as I've watched each of his low budget losers - films such as Out for a Kill or Submerged - some small part of my psyche manages to wax nostalgic over blockbusters of the past, such as Under Siege and The Glimmer Man, in an effort to deflect the pain inflicted by witnessing a great martial artist fade away into a caricature of himself.  While Born to Raise Hell does little to dispell this trend, I assure you it is a watchable film which won't disappoint most fans.  If Seagal did, indeed, write the screenplay himself, his ideas weren't bad ones but could have been better structured, and the characters needed more rapport with each other.  The editing was a little puzzling, with freeze frames coming up at inappropriate times, but did not completely distract from the thrust of the film.  The fight scenes were actually decent this time around, especially the fight scene in the restaurant which clearly did not use stupid gimmicks like speeding up the film or cutting so quickly you couldn't tell what happened - it was all Seagal, doing aikido again.  His films need more of that.  Overall, I'm ""OK"" with the film, though it wasn't the great come back gem for which I still yearn.  Urban Justice remains his best recent release, the film that left my soul ignited anew with hope Seagal is on some sort of come back trail - the path may be skewed, and it may be a very slow burn - so I keep watching.",1303516800,12,1578,4.53169014084507
4436450,1,B004NYYDT8,"It's just more of the same from the Fat Lord but more brutal--there's a hard-to-watch rape scene that's repeated in slo-mo later on--and all the ""action"" in the film is fast editing and sleazy Euro-trash guys and sleazy Euro-trash women with a script from the FL.

No.  Really.  Maybe people have made enough movies.

The only thing that could have made this movie watchable would have been if a giant snake had slithered in and eaten everybody.

In one scene one of the FL's cop friends punches a criminal in the stomach and then, stupidly, stands there.  The criminal vomits on the cop.  I felt as stupid as that cop because this movie pretty much vomits on anyone who watches it.",1303257600,5,682,4.586776859504132

Now that I got that out of the way let's talk about this film. This is the classic example of working with the evil you already know to get rid of a worse evil. None of Seagal's more recent films are family films because he insist on putting topless dancers and prostitutes. Excellent role casting for the Dan Badarau as Dimitri, evil number one and the number two evil was well portrayed also. This film actually has a storyline that makes sense and a plot that is worth following. And if nothing else all of Seagal's films have plenty of fight scenes, car chases and explosions.

And the really weird thing about this movie was the constant narration (I assume from Seagal's main character) but it didn't sound like Seagal to me. It was whispery like he whispers, but even more so. Though Seagal seems to get quieter and more whispery with every picture, his narration and even his main character lines were delivered too quietly for me to understand.

4436510,3,B004NYYDT8,"We watch Seagal films because the acting is bad, the dialouge is worse, and the plot twists have the complexity a granny knot. Seagal plays a special international DEA agent who seeks revenge for the death of his partner, something we don't know anything about as there is absolutely no character build-up or introduction, a characteristic of Seagal's fine precise writing ability.

Seagal is in Bucharest, Romania according to the writing on the screen. They also use the same font to run their credits (Highlight, right click, font, click, then change).

4436511,3,B004NYYDT8,"With a screenplay written by Steven Seagal, the gritty crime drama Born to Raise Hell (2010), has some issues, but it is still probably one of Seagal's better releases in recent years.  The film features some pretty solid action scenes, and a reasonably plausible story involving agents pursing drug dealers in Bucharest, Romania.  Of interest to Seagal fans, although featuring dizzying quick cuts, slow motion shots, and some occasional body doubling, Seagal appears to do much of his own fighting, and actually gives one of his better, minimally pretentious acting performances.

American Bobby Samuels (Seagal) is with the International Drug Task Force (IDTF), which is trying to get a handle of the drug scene in Bucharest.  Samuels and his partner Steve (D. Neil Mark) are after a man named Costel (Darren Shahlavi), who along with his gang, is responsible for a string of home invasions and murders.  Besides robbery, Costel also deals drugs out of a nightclub he owns.  Dimitri (Dan Badaru) is a wealthy high end drug dealer, who has recently become associated with Costel.  He runs a high tech drug lab, with beautiful women processing his product.  Eventually, the criminals have a falling out, and Costel makes a strike against Dimitri.  This leads to an unlikely partnership where Samuels is asked to look the other way, so Dimitri can get revenge, while Samuels brings the case to a bloody conclusion.  Costel and Dimitri are both murderous drug dealers, but one somehow becomes regarded as a ""man of honor"" at the end.

Continuing to shoot movies in Eastern Europe, Seagal is probably pretty well regarded there, as a provider of many employment opportunities.  There may not be a lot of familiar names in the cast, but they do a pretty good job, particularly Darren Shahlavi, Dan Badaru, and Claudiu Bleont, who has a minor role as crook.  There are a good number of beautiful women, many in their first film, some nudity, and typical for a Seagal film, lots of scenes in a nightclub, including some fire breathing performers.

As a member of law enforcement, Bobby Samuels is a slightly more credible character, than some of the lone wolf types Seagal often plays.  His character still goes berserk, but there's generally a little more believability in the situations you see, with fewer witty one-liners.  Samuels has a girlfriend, so there are no female partners, or awkward romantic entanglements on the job, which helps keep the focus on the central story.

Seagal may not be a brilliant writer, particularly when it comes to dialog, and he is at times self-indulgent, and occasionally wanders off track, but overall he does a decent enough job in Born To Be Bad.  While there are many ridiculous elements, the story holds together fairly well, which is rather unusual for a Seagal shoot `em up.  Making stylized violence a priority, stunt performer turned director Lauro Chartrand, does a serviceable job in his first effort.  While the quality of Seagal's recent direct to video releases may be spotty, this is one of his stronger efforts.",1337990400,,3061,4.976424361493124

Through the first half I thought it might be low-key, below average and I might be disappointed ,,, but I was wrong!!! The movie ""carried well"" from start to finish; very well written, acted (by all) and directed.

I found the (international) acting to be top-notch and the screenplay had no extra bovine crap, no melodramatic bs thrown in for the female audience member ,,, except maybe for Seagal taking a few moments to satisfy his woman. It was brief and realistically erotic.

All in all a very good and very entertainiing movie.

Above all I loved the international scenery and the outstanding international actors!!!",1320105600,2,839,4.726027397260274
4436517,3,B004NYYDT8,"Very much a typical Seagal movie, lots of shooting and suspense yet guess I was hoping for not as much violence/blood this time around.  Did not think was a good as The Keeper but much better than some of his previous releases.  Appears he does his own fight scenes, and maybe just a little voice dubbing, or maybe his own voice pre-recorded before it was shot.  Really can't figure out why he does voice dubbing anyway, could be his voice gets tired from all the movies he does, not sure.  Overall, it's worth a watch for the average Seagal fan.

4436519,3,B004NYYDT8,"We watch Seagal films because the acting is bad, the dialouge is worse, and the plot twists have the complexity a granny knot. Seagal plays a special international DEA agent who seeks revenge for the death of his partner, something we don't know anything about as there is absolutely no character build-up or introduction, a characteristic of Seagal's fine precise writing ability. (It's an action film, stupid!)

Seagal is in Bucharest, Romania according to the writing on the screen. They also use the same font to run their credits (Highlight, right click, font, click, then change). The Russian mafia is manufacturing and fronting drugs to the Romanians, who in turn use beautiful women to mule these drugs all over Europe. Apparently their airport security is like ours and only pat down old people. Seagal has a new partner who he verbally abuses. The Romanian mafia also does home break-ins where they rob people and then rape and kill women, not necessarily in that order. (The Russian mafia is civilized and don't approve of that behavior.)

4436520,2,B004NYYDT8,"After years of bottom-of-the-barrel direct-to-DVD-films, Seagal has made some decent films in the last couple of years, so I've come to expect more from him now than I did 3 or 4 years ago.

In ""Born to Raise Hell"", we get the usual ingredients, an eastern Europe setting (Romania), a crime boss, strippers, and of course, Seagal. Unfortunately, we also get uninspired writing and a slow moving plot. It doesn't start out well when Seagal, in narration, tells us that ""six months ago my partner was killed. I'll find those responsible and bring them to justice"" (approximate quote from memory). Seagal wrote this film and he's written a half dozen films before, so he should know one of the main rules of screenwriting: ""Show, don't tell"". Seagal films by nature, like Arnold films, Stallone films, Dolph Lundgren and Van Damme films, are star vehicles, one man shows. But this one suffers from a weak protagonist. We never get to know or care about Seagal's character and too much time is spent on secondary characters. I felt more sympathy for the Dimitri character, played by Dan Badarau. Towards the end of the film, he becomes its real star. First time director Lauro Chartrand is apparently an experienced stunt man but not a great director. Strange camera angles and silly jump cuts give the film a cheap, amateurish feeling. There are some action scenes, of course, but they're not that good (mainly shooting scenes, little fighting) and with the dull story we never really care.

""Born to Raise Hell"" is decidedly less entertaining than some of Seagal's other recent films. For Seagal fans only.",1312243200,4,1604,4.893382352941177
