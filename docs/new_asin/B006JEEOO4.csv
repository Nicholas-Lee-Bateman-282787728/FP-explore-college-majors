8499380,1,B006JEEOO4,"I have two major complaints with this video and this series. The first is quantity. This video is 15 minutes in length. That's it. But instead of putting several of these biographies on one DVD to make a 60-90 minute program, a DVD is seperately sold for each president. The product does not justify the volume of this program.

The quality is poor as well. I don't mean that it's amateur, this is forgiveable if it is educational. But some of the information is suspect and some is just plain wrong. For example, the narrator in one part of the presentation tells is that the subject William Henry Harrison (referred to throughout most of the documentary as ""William Harrison"") was the oldest Present ever elected, but in another part this is qualified with the correct information that Harrison was the oldest until Ronald Reagan came along.

A picture is identified as that of Harrison when it is in fact a picture of James K. Polk. Another picture of a revolutionary war general in a powdered wig is identified as George Washington. I don't know who the general is in that picture, but it most certainly isn't George Washington.

The notion of documentaries on the obscure presidents had so much potential. The makers of this series have slapped together a sloppy product in an effort to make an easy buck. Save your money and don't purchase this sub-standard product.",1333584000,,1372,4.756302521008403
