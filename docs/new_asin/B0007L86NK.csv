8048164,1,B0007L86NK,"I saw that other jeff leroy movie ""crack"" and thought it was good but thing sucks to the extreme right from the get go, it's got that ""doctor who"" feel to it, like you're watching people read lines in front of a green screen, etc. Maybe ""crack"" was just a different style or maybe the actors were good or just naturally fit the parts, i mean a a lot of hollywood is that way where an actor is just being themselves but it works excellent for the part ( chris pratt for example or all the cast members of "" The O.C."") but when they try to act it's terrible, so any part that's not just like they are in real life sucks. I don't know but this ultra sucked and ""crack"" was good.",1517702400,,675,4.044776119402985
8048165,4,B0007L86NK,"I was curious about a Ron Jeremy film that was not in his (ahmem)usual genre, and was pleasantly surprised. Very well made for a lo budget flick. The female lead is a very strong character it's kinda entertaining to see the miscellaneous rocker-dudes in their bad-boy roles. Couldn't remember all the details but found a good description at IMDB:

What happens when rock stars, scream queens and a porn icon get together? Find out in this explosive actioner following a Dixie chick stripper as she attempts to avenge the murder of her imprisoned sister. With the help of a sympathetic cop, the sexy siren faces off against a dangerous band of assassins in the ultimate fight for revenge. Ron Jeremy, Phoebe Dollar, Dizzy Reed, Tracii Guns, and Lemmy from Motorhead star. When a stripper finds out that her sister has been murdered while in prison, she seeks revenge in this pulse-racing action-thriller.
