8532935,4,B005QRONW8,"A few crackles and pops are to be expected in the soundtrack of an almost 50-year-old 16 mm film.  The picture quality is wonderfully clear.  Specks and scratches exist throughout, but mostly around reel changes.
The opening scene immediately grabbed me.  Perhaps his son Kurt inherited his style.  Perhaps this scene was used as inspiration.  But Bing Russell's opening monologue totally reminded me of Snake Pliskin.  And since this is a father-and-son story, I kept falling into the fantasy that Joe and Joey are real-life Bing and Kurt.  (I don't recall the boy's actual name.  He's a good little actor, too.)
This is one of the rare Crown International films not owned by Mill Creek.  So a collector has nothing to complain about.  It's overall quality is as good (if not better) than many of the titles they have released.  The back cover, though, only has a generic description of what Sinister offers--no credits, plot summary or anything.",1427673600,,947,4.930379746835443

mistake to ship back?? Very unfair!",1363996800,,134,4.625
