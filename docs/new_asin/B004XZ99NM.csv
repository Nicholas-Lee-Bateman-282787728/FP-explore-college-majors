8447761,5,B004XZ99NM,"I wasn't too sure about this - there were no reviews to read about it, but I took a chance.
It turned out to be great.  From what I read, it's the same show as another they have out (Ultimate Soul Divas) - although why they would have the same show under two different titles is a mystery.
They are dynamite - that's the only way you can describe them.  At one point, one of the sisters (I don't know which one) takes the mike and talks about the fact that they have been doing this since the 70's!
They certainly have it down pat, and they are slick, slick, slick, and fantastic entertainers.
Their band is dynamite, too.  One of the singers is the daughter, I think, of one of the sisters who died, and if you didn't know, you'd never think that she had ever been anything other than one of the performing sisters.  She certainly held her own, and I didn't think any of them seemed weaker than any of the others.",1338076800,3,914,4.2057142857142855
