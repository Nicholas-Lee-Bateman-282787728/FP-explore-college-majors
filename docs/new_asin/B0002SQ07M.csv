8031427,5,B0002SQ07M,This DVD is a great learning tool for any level of modeler.  I used the information for building a war-gaming table but the information is universal to any hobbyist interested in creating their own terrain or dioramas.  Each step in the process is clearly laid out and presented.  The book of the same name serves as an excellent supplement for this video and really should be purchased together.,1189987200,5,396,4.794117647058823
