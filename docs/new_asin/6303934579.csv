731931,2,6303934579,"Marginally affecting in a gentle 50's way, but ultimately can't overcome the torpid pacing. A bit too gentle for my tastes. Virginia McKenna is, as always, worth the watching",963273600,,174,5.0344827586206895
732012,5,6303934579,"The Smallest Show on Earth is a great film.  I saw this movie forty years ago and it has all the heart and humor I remember.  A ""must see"" for anyone who loves old classics. Sellers and Rutherford are splendid.  Bob Ebinger",1243123200,2,223,4.261904761904762
732013,5,6303934579,"Leonard Maltin calls this movie ""Charming and hilarious"". Our library had this one on VHS in our old building. Now in our new building, I'm glad to provide some lighthearted fare for our DVD fans!",1239321600,,196,4.628571428571429
732014,4,6303934579,"Matt Spenser (Bill Travers) is notified through the mail that he has inherited his great uncle's fortune. Will he please come to claim it? The Spensers are thrilled at the prospect of getting money, although Matt is unsure about whether he had an uncle in the first place. Indeed he did, but the fortune is a small one. He has inherited one rundown movie theater called the Bijou. As soon as he hears that an offer has been made to sell, Matt decides he wants to take the money and run, but the offer is much smaller than it was before. The Spensers decide to open the theater to bluff the buyer, and in doing so become quite friendly with the staff.

This is a sweet, minor film about the love of a cinema. There are some touching scenes, like when the staff decides to run an old silent movie. There is plenty of comedy as well, like when Matt turns up the heat during the desert movies to sell more ice cream. The ending is not entirely satisfying, though, and this isn't an art piece the way that Cinema Paradiso is, but The Smallest Show on Earth is an enjoyable obscure film.",1238976000,,1081,4.325123152709359
732015,5,6303934579,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS DVD. THE ENTIRE CAST WAS SPLENDID. MARGARET RUTHERFORD IS IN A CLASS ALL HER OWN. I WAS SURPRISED WHEN READING THE CREDITS THAT THE USHER WAS BERNARD MILES. PETER SELLERS WAS GREAT IN HIS ROLE AS WELL.

I RECOMEND THIS DVD FOR ANYONE WANTING A PEACEFUL AND PLEASANT EVENING",1181606400,,295,4.566037735849057
732016,5,6303934579,"I was pleasantly surprised by two features of this discount DVD title. First, the quality of the print...sharp,clear, no scratches,and properly formatted to original theatre screen dimensions.  second, the very entertaining and warm comedy....Note this is selling for as little as  1 cent by some Amazon resellers(used)",1180742400,5,319,5.76595744680851
732017,5,6303934579,This is a great 50's Peter Sellers movie about life in a smalltown crumbling movie theatre. It's a must see that's now on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!,1117584000,6,137,4.75
732018,4,6303934579,"First off, anybody purchasing this film expecting a Peter Sellers vehicle will be slightly disappointed.  This is an ensemble piece with Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna as the nominal stars.  Sellers has a smallish role as an ancient projectionist.  That said, this is a movie that champions the movie-going experience even if you experience it at a fleabag establishment and the viewing fare are old cornball cowboy movies whose prints are scratched, faded, and out of focus.  Since this movie came out in the fifties, I can relate this experience to my own youth viewing genre movies (kung-fu, slasher,etc.) at soon to be demolished downtown Philadelphia movie palaces in the late seventies and early eighties.  Anybody who remembers the neighborhood movie going experience before the rise of multiplexes will love this movie.",1091577600,9,830,5.257575757575758
732019,5,6303934579,"'THE SMALLEST SHOW ON EARTH' may not have been exactly that since there were certainly smaller, but it was a case of a fictional small ""electric theatre"" (the British way of differentiating a movie theatre from a legitimate theatre or 'music hall,' as they designated their version of the American vaudeville). This delightful British film is as heart warming and sometimes hilarious as the other reviewers here describe, but it is the wonderful interaction between the story, the sets, and the actors that balance the film and make it a classic. This 19th century 'kinema' was styled in the manner of the traditional British 'music hall' of live performers, but held the earliest of projection equipment (hence the double entendre about projectionist Peter Sellers' 'equipment.') Such asides will be over the heads of the kiddies, but the pleasant pacing and careful dialogue of the actors will please the adults for whom this comedy is intended.
The story of a young couple inheriting a cinema and finding that it is not quite the money-maker they imagined would have been prosaic were it not for the clever settings and the three fossils who maintained the old ""Bijou"" (French for 'jewel'). If it were ever a jewel, it had lost its luster as the years passed and patrons flocked to the newer nearby movie palace, the 'Grand.' Desperate to keep their jobs, the 'fossils' (veteran scene-stealers: Peter Sellers, Margaret Rutherford, and Bernard Miles) took pains to refresh the old place to please new owner Bill Travers, a too seldom used actor of mild presence but uniquely suited to this role. The character of the Bijou's ""commissioner"" (doorman, janitor, and boiler keeper) Miles in the end tries too hard and creates the only jarring note in the film, which is otherwise tender and memorable. The device of having latter day elevated trains roar past the cinema was inspired and created some memorable scenes, as when the building sways to the slow start up of the train, or when Bill Travers' character is almost rattled off the ladder as he attempts to relight the old roof sign. There are many wonderful sight gags and other fine bits that one will long remember.
For those who also like old theatres, it may be of interest to know that the exterior of the Bijou was actually a set created at the meeting of two existing elevated train bridges on Christchurch Ave. at the Kilburn LT station in London. The interior was a also a set, but so well done that you would swear that you were in a real 19th century 'opera house.' The design is thought to be derived from the real Palace of Varieties at Camberwell. The movie palace with the pipe organ - the Grand -- was actually the Gaumont Palace (later the Odeon, now Apollo) in Hammersmith, London. And the use of the fictional name of ""Sloughborough"" for the town is another little joke since it means 'low place or mire.' These details can be confirmed in the journal of the British ""Cinema Theatre Association's"" magazine ""PICTURE HOUSE,"" No. 19, Winter 93-94, pages 37 and 38, (where there are photos in this and the previous issue) furnished to this reviewer courtesy of Mr. Brian J. Hall of England.
One reviewer said that the only flaw was that the story was too short and I must concur in that, and that is the only real flaw I can find in the film as well. There is a difficulty, however, in appreciating the quality of the film from the most common versions of the VHS-NTSC format videos now available. Amazon lists two ASIN numbers of versions made by the same French Canadian firm, Madacy, which produced them in EP speed, rather than the usual SP speed that allows for quality. Since Amazon never indicates the speed of a tape, I cannot tell if their third variation produced by 'VCI Classics (American Prudential)' is also in this slow speed of poor quality. Not only is the image poor, but the sound is downright difficult to understand! Amazon's sister company, The Internet Movie Data Base ([...] now lists two CD versions about to be released, and we can but hope that they were made from restored masters and are the pleasure that the original film is.
P.S.: Two years before the movie ""Majestic"" (starring Jim Carrey) debuted, the director wrote on the THEATRE HISTORICAL SOCIETY'S web site that he was searching for information about historic theatres for his forthcoming unnamed movie. This reviewer responded with information and said that the description of it he gave sounded something like ""The Smallest Show on Earth."" He responded that he was amazed that anyone remembered the 1956 British film, but that it was an inspiration for his movie. Look closely at the lobby in ""Majestic"" and you will see it clearly resembles that in the 'Bijou,' even if the facades were much different. These films turned out very differently, but at least the architecture rewards lovers of theatres.",1040169600,18,4865,4.806682577565632
732020,5,6303934579,"THE SMALLEST SHOW ON EARTH, the Bijou movie house, is well worth watching for its'lesson in what acting is all about. The enigmatic title is the only puzzlement of the movie. Otherwise, you get entertainment the British plain acting way that only the British seem to know how to do it. ""Smallest"" is a simple, delightful plot of what might go wrong with the best laid plans of inheritance when the legatees need to put an over-the-hill movie house back in business to compete with an up-to-date rival. You are tenderly entertained, then, by the actors Rutherford, Sellers, and Bernard Miles who were former employees and a threesome tossed into the plot as part of the inheritance. Margaret Rutherford was the deceased's ""courtesan"" ticket-seller bookkeeper who found a way to keep the old theater operating by taking in, as admission ticket ""money,"" chickens, eggs, and such bookkeeping entries. She also is wise to the dipsy sot up there in the projection booth, Peter Sellers. Despite his penchant for booze he manages to make the ancient projectionist equipment function; equipment manufactured and carried over from Tudor times I would guess. Sellers did not cotton well to Margaret Rutherford. His major complaint was her bad behavior, suggesting thus that the new owner ought to not sack her, but could "" . . . say something rude and nasty to her."" Bernard Miles,urban relative of the village idiot, janitor and doorman aspired to continue working, but only if he could have a u-nee-form; one like the doorman in the competing movie house [with white gloves tucked under the left shouler epaulette, you see]. A good story also includes something inanimate object that actually plays a role. In this production, that ""actor"" is the thundering Britrail locomotive driven train that rattles the Bijou movie house, projection equipment and moviegoers, hilariously shaken--not stirred. The Bijou itself is a vestigial of Britain's lust for theater complete with organ that played musical strains for the silent movies, and a section in the back where young couples learned some of the facts of life. Theaters like this, originally opera houses and music halls, still exist in the Notting Hill section of London. Besides all of this location nostalgia, the characters are funny . . . gove'ner.",1001203200,25,2294,5.071428571428571
732021,1,6303934579,"The one-star rating refers to this particular version. The film itself is a pleasant British comedy about a young couple's adventures with an ancient movie theater and its ancient staff. However, this is an extended-play tape of a bootleg-quality print with inferior picture and sound, and fans of the film will definitely be disappointed by the video presentation.",977356800,18,365,5.310344827586207

7855724,3,6303934579,"British comedies from the 1950s never were my cuppa tea but this little film is rather sweet in an innocuous sort of way despite its disturbingly unethical ending. A young couple (Bill Travers, Virginia McKenna of BORN FREE) inherit a broken down dump of a movie house from a deceased relative. Their idea is to appear to be renovating the theatre so that a rival film house will buy them out but circumstances change that force them to actually make a go of it. Margaret Rutherford as the cashier, Peter Sellers, playing much much older than he is, as the projectionist and Bernard Miles as the usher co-star. Somehow I was hoping that the film, directed by Basil Dearden (KHARTOUM), would convey a passion or at least a fondness for movies but its attachment to cinema is quite perfunctory.

The Anchor Bay DVD is a decent anamorphic wide screen (1.66) transfer.",1316476800,2,864,4.7218543046357615
7855725,4,6303934579,"I really enjoyed this classic old movie peter sellers shows his skill as a actor in the early stages of his career,great story line with a tiny hint of sexyness from the lead actress.
This is a movie that i will watch again and again when in the mood for some good old 50's british humour.",1311120000,,289,4.178571428571429
7855726,5,6303934579,"If you like a good humorous movie that doesn't have to come out and beg you to laugh, this is difinitely what our good ""chaps"" across the sea are so good at doing. This 80 minute B&W DVD is a keeper.

Take the simple plot of an unexpected intheritance by a young couple
that happens to be the disappointing  old run down Bijous Cinema known as the ""flea trap"" that has seen better days and the newer nearby modern Grande is now the place to watch the movies. What happens from here on is where the story moves on its way as they decide to re-open the old cinema.

With just a mention of two of the main characters namely, as usual
at her best, Margaret Rutherford playing the part of the ticket taker, bookkeeper and previous piano player for the old silent films
gives a priceless performance.  Peter Sellers made up to be an older simple minded character for the role as projectionist using the  unpredictable out-dated equipment, and what possibly could go wrong
usually does, plays the role to perfection. The remainder of the cast
does a very pleasing job.

The movie runs smoothly from scene to scene without the waste of a
minute to keep you well entertained. The chemistry of the cast, plus
the writing and directing jobs so well done,  make this movie guarenteed to keep your attention and definitely tickle your funny bone.
