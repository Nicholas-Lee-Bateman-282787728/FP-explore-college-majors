3658831,1,B001JP651S,"Ordered this DVD as a Christmas gift for my great grandfather and it won't work in ANY DVD player that I have tried it in. Luckily I ordered two different ones, so he had something to watch and enjoy, but I was pretty disappointed that I wasn't able to get it to play. On a positive note, it got to my house really quickly and I was able to get it wrapped and put under the tree for Christmas in time...Better luck next time I guess, right?",1232409600,4,440,4.068965517241379

3658833,5,B001JP651S,The C.D. was ordered for my older sister who has short term memory loss and resides at an assisted living facility. She has enjoyed it very much. She loves music and has always enjoyed the Lawrence Welk Show. I recommend this C.D. very highly .,1229904000,12,244,4.444444444444445
3658834,5,B001JP651S,"I LOVE ""The Lawrence Welk Show"", especially the black and white years.  The three shows in this collection were from 1960, 1962, and 1963.  They were live shows, taken from kinescopes, but the quality is pretty good!  My only complaint is that the commercials have been edited out, and the cuts are a bit abrupt, and thee were a few jumps in the picture.  The shows on this DVD are WAY better than the newer color shows that are shown ad nauseum on PBS.

The Lennon Sisters, Barbara and Bobby, Bob Lido, Aladdin, Dick Dale, Rocky Rockwell, Jerry Burke, Frank Scott, Larry Hooper, Joann Castle, Jack Imel, and the rest of Lawrence's fine orchestra and cast are on this collection.

If you're a Lawrence Welk fan, or just like good wholesome TV and music, order this DVD!",1227657600,39,769,4.576642335766423
