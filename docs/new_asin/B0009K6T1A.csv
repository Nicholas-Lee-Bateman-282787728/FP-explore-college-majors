8062460,4,B0009K6T1A,"I recommend this video with one caveat. The cinematography is fuzzy, the colors dull, as if watching a 1970s sitcom. I suppose HD has spoiled me, and perhaps others won't mind as much. The video itself is very detailed and informative, offering up the patron-artist relationship between home owner Kaufmann and Wright; the tensions, the creative process, the give-and-take between two strong-minded individuals to bring a magnificent structure into being. The house now belongs to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, hence the signs (""Entrance"") that somewhat spoil the homey atmosphere. Overall, the video succeeds in introducing the beauty and the true grandeur of Fallingwater in its sylvan setting.",1339027200,,704,5.588785046728972
