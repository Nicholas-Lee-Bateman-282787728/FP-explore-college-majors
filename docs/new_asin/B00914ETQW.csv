5231672,4,B00914ETQW,"It's great to have the Danny Kaye Show on dvd!!! It's about time. I say bring on the complete seasons or just more episodes on ""theme based"" DVD sets. The one problem I had with this DVD was that odd cut in the Peggy Lee episode...is that where the seven mins. were lost? I can forgive the odd ""film"" look of the remastered video tape for the quality of entertainment found in each episode. Other than that, thanks for releasing the shows.",1354924800,,439,4.365853658536586
5231673,5,B00914ETQW,"WOW, this is, in my opinion, the BEST Christmas DVD released this year. TWO vintage Danny Kaye CBS Television shows from 1963 and 1966, with TONS of great stuff to see and hear!

A ""Dick Van Dyke Show""-era Mary Tyler Moore appears in the first episode, after a cool James Bond-inspired dance number and swingin' Danny Kaye song. Nat King Cole belts out a track from his latest LP, ""Songs from My Fair Lady"", and it's the same arrangement as on the album, but done live with an orchestra inside CBS Television City! Then, the set around him suddenly morphs into a warm room with a crackling fire, and Nat sings ""The Christmas Song"" (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire). Danny joins him for a rousing medley of ""Jingle Bells Around The World"" songs! It's truly amazing to see these two entertainment icons having so much fun together. Nat would live only another year and 2 months after this program was taped, dying of lung cancer, so this video is TRULY a treasure.

Fast-forward ahead three years, and by this time, CBS is broadcasting in COLOR! Fun animated opening titles, and a glimpse of Paul Weston, husband of Jo Stafford, who's conducting the orchestra. (Glad he's not ""Jonathan Edwards"" here!!) The glamorous Peggy Lee wows with a cool new song, accompanied by funky organ, and then jumps into the SAME ""Jingle Bells Around The World"" medley with Danny, that Nat Cole did three years earlier! Interesting to compare the two versions. A young Wayne Newton performs, dripping with all the winky-eye swagger he can muster!

Plus there's much, much more to enjoy.

I am particularly impressed with whoever did the very smooth editing of the show from the original tapes for a home video audience. I realize there were telops of old sponsor's products that were superimposed on-screen, as well as announcer voice-overs, that had to be removed (although they would've been fun if left in place) - so even with those things taken out, the shows play seamlessly, and I'm grateful for that. Time-Life could take some editing lessons from the Inception Video staff!
Hoping to see more interesting vintage TV releases from Inception.

*Please note: there is apparently a small glitch on some of the earlier pressings of this DVD disc, at the 34:00 minute mark during the color show with Peggy Lee. If you experience this problem, contact Inception and let them know. (Many thanks to Steven I. Ramm, for his helpful comment to my earlier review, and also to Steve Coppel at Inception!)",1354838400,,2527,4.826789838337183
5231674,4,B00914ETQW,"I was pleasantly surprised to see Harvey Korman & Jamie Farr as regulars. I have not seen this show since it's original broadcasts and didn't remember these two talents being a part of the show.
And seeing a ""Dick Van Dyke Show"" aged Mary Tyler Moore outside of that show brought me back to 1963.  I'm not used to seeing her at that young age outside of the D.V.D. show.

What makes these shows pleasant is that everyone seems to be having fun, especially when Jamie Farr gets accidentally tied to a chair and can't get loose!

SHOW #1 Episode #1.14 Dec. 25, 1963 (B&W - 51 minutes) The video quality of the first show is as good as the old B&W video cameras can give.  It seems to be mastered from the original video tape and not a 16mm film kinescope. The image is sharp, however there are dark halos around any bright objects creating a kind of solar-eclipse effect.  The audio is clear as it is important to hear the clarity of the songs.

Danny welcomes guests Nat 'King' Cole, Mary Tyler Moore and the singing Clinger Sisters. Sketches include a parody of ""The Student Prince"" and another featuring Danny and Mary playing wealthy socialites. With Harvey Korman & Jamie Farr.

SHOW #2 Episode #4.14 Dec. 21, 1966 (COLOR - EDITED to 44 minutes) The video quality of the second show starts out looking good, but it becomes apparent that the new Color studio video cameras have trouble properly recording black backgrounds, and The Danny Kaye Show likes to use black backgrounds in place of actual sets.  You will see bleeding around the edges, going purple and even lighter, as the cameras try to mike the blacks into a color.  There is also a strange ""film like"" look to this episode, as if we were actually watching a 16mm color kinescope and not the original 2"" video tape. I have seen this effect happen when converting analogue videotape to a digital format. But if this were the case, why only the second episode?  AND WHY EDIT 7 MINUTES AND SAY BOTH SHOWS ARE COMPLETE?????  I guess there was one song that they could not get the rights to re-use here.

For his Christmas program Danny is joined by singers Peggy Lee and Wayne Newton, the International Children's Choir of Long Beach, California, and series regulars Harvey Korman and Joyce Van Patten. Danny plays a father who encounters great difficulty assembling a bicycle for his son on Christmas Eve. Later he plays the elderly Italian tailor Giovanni who has moved to America to live with his son and daughter-in-law.

BONUS (COLOR - 7 minute clip)  I guess to make up for cutting 7 minutes out, the Kaye Trust decided to give us 7 minutes from another christmas show.  But why not give us the entire show and make this a 2-disc set?

MISSING FROM THIS DVD SET:
Episode #1.13 Dec. 18, 1963
In this Christmas-themed show, Danny welcomes as his guests Andy Williams, Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore. Danny and Dick are featured in a song-and-dance number, 'Puttin on the Ritz'. The featured comedy skit has Van Dyke portraying a tough as nails prosecutor locking horns with a seedy defense attorney during a murder trail were both lawyers play to television cameras in the courtroom.

Episode #2.14  Dec. 23, 1964
In this Christmas-themed episode, Gwen Verdon and Jo Stafford join Danny, Harvey Korman and The Tony Charmoli Dancers. Skits include Danny and Gwen playing rejected dolls in a child's bedroom. Danny plays an old Italian tailor waiting for a phone call from his son who lives in the United States. Danny, Gwen and Harvey star in a spy spoof called, ""The Spy Who Got Cold"". Jo, Gwen and Danny sing several Christmas tunes.

Episode #3.14  Dec. 22, 1065
For this Christmas-themed show, Danny is joined by actress Jean Simmons, actor Laurence Harvey and singer John Gary. In one sketch Jean and Laurence plot to murder a rich Englishman who proves more difficult to bump off than they planned. Danny plays a shy man trapped by a blizzard at a ski resort who must cuddle with the beautiful Jean Simmons to keep warm.

Episode #3.15 Dec. 29, 1965
Singer/actor Eddie Albert and singer Wayne Newton join Danny and series regulars Harvey Korman and Joyce Van Patten in this New Year's Eve themed episode. In the opening sketch, Danny plays Father Time awaiting the arrival of the baby representing the New Year. In another sketch Danny and Eddie play two men suffering from hangovers after being over-served and under-supervised at a New Year's Eve Party the night before.

Maybe there will be a ""Volume 2"" next year!",1353542400,9,4490,4.6713197969543145
5231675,1,B00914ETQW,"As welcome as it is to get episodes from Danny's Kaye's wonderful CBS variety series, this DVD flunks out on 2 major counts. It states on the box that it contains 2 COMPLETE episodes. Not so. The second show with Peggy Lee is missing about 7 minutes of content. Likely another rights clearance issue, but don't promise complete if you really can't deliver.

More annoying is the current trend of taking gorgeous 2"" videotape and encoding it to look like film. This DVD suffers from this horrid destruction of the original ""live"" look of these shows in favor of catering to the 12-year-old video game crowd who seem to crave jerky motion and Youtube video quality.

5231697,4,B00914ETQW,"I watched THE DANNY KAYE SHOW on CBS when I was a kid.  It was very entertaining, and I have also enjoyed several of the late Mr. Kaye's movies, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Christmas-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B002MU4NN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Christmas (Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Man-VHS/dp/6302227178/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Man [VHS</a>], which has not yet been released on DVD - the one that Amazon lists appears to be a bootleg or a European import.

This DVD features two Christmas episodes of THE DANNY KAYE SHOW.  The first one, in B&W from 1963, features The Clinger Sisters (whatever happened to them?), Mary Tyler Moore, who shows off her dancing ability in a silent-film production number, and the legendary Nat ""King"" Cole, who sings ""Get Me To The Church On Time,"" and the classic ""The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You),"" a.k.a. ""Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire,"" as well as a duet with Danny on ""Jingle Bells,"" and a closing cast number on ""Let There Be Peace on Earth.""  This may have been one of Nat's last TV appearances, as he was deathly sick the following Christmas, and died in February 1965.

The second episode, in color from 1966, features the late great Peggy Lee, Wayne Newton, and The International Children's Choir.  Peggy sings ""So What's New?,"" an instrumental hit for Herb Alpert And The Tijuana Brass that she added lyrics to, ""Here's That Rainy Day,"" and duets with Danny on ""Jingle Bells.""  Wayne performs ""Jingle Bell Rock"" and ""Every Street's A Boulevard (In Old New York).""  The Choir does ""Let There Be Peace On Earth.""  Both episodes feature classic comedy sketches, including Danny's trademark dialects.

A bonus feature from 1965 features Danny reading an excerpt from Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol.""

Picture and sound quality are good, considering the age of the shows.  The color is a bit off on the second version, but that may have been because CBS was only in its second year of colorcasts (""CBS presents this program in color!""), a couple of years behind ABC, and a decade behind NBC.

Harvey Korman, of CAROL BURNETT SHOW fame, is featured on both episodes; Jamie Farr, later of *M*A*S*H*, is on the first episode.

5231702,5,B00914ETQW,"This disc takes me back to the 1960s when variety was just that.

There is a skit in the first show ""The Phinemaiden Bicrggrden"" (I think) where a young Jamie Farr (from MASH) did a performance as an extra soldier, and it was great to watch him perform.

These shows helped many people immensely to get the experience needed to move into movies and their own shows. The shows were done live and all the mistakes were seen by thousands of viewers, but who cared, it was entertainment at it's grandest. Something that is sorely missed in today's environment.

With entertainers like Mary Tyler Moore, Nat King Cole, Peggy Lee, Wayne Newton and the Glinger Sisters there is bound to be something to please most people from the era. There are two songs by the International Children's Choir, which I repeated a few times as they were very good for their age.

Danny Kaye was one of the great entertainers and I thought it was a shame when he became an ambassador for UNICEF, but he did a grand job of both show business and as an ambassador. When you listened to Danny talk about children, you could understand why he took the role as ambassador.

The disc holds only two of his shows plus one extras, so it will only give the viewer a small taste of them. Danny's shows were among a dozen that gave people a small reprieve from their otherwise normal lives, and always came away feeling much better, for a while at least.

In the bonus Danny does a heart-felt narration from Charles Dickens' book ""Christmas Carols"" which is a delight to hear.

This dvd gets five stars from me as it was great to see Danny Kaye again after so many years, even it was only for a very short time. I enjoyed the dvd, and hope that people who buy it will also be pleased with this small sample.",1367280000,,1771,4.414110429447852

5231716,4,B00914ETQW,"With the exception of a handful of bootlegged episodes, THE DANNY KAYE SHOW has been completely unavailable for home viewing since it originally aired nearly 50 years ago. As research for my new book DANNY KAYE: KING OF JESTERS, I had to travel to UCLA to watch the few shows they held and, for the rest, to Washington, D.C., to view the originals donated to the Library of Congress by Kaye's estate. Thank heavens these wonderful shows are now beginning to see the light of day. And these first two programs are timeless. Modern audiences will enjoy Danny at his most engaging, terrific guest stars, catchy song and dance numbers, and charming comedy sketches.

Two quibbles: First, DVDs from the first pressing contained an ""authoring"" problem that makes it difficult to view one of the sketches. Inception Media didn't cut anything and will exchange flawed discs for flawless ones. All DVDs shipped beginning December 2012 should be AOK. Full story here: thedannykayeshow.blogspot.com/2012/12/defective-discs-plague-christmas-dvd.html

Second, the only bonus feature is a clip from another Christmas show that would have been best saved for when the full episode is released. I would have loved to have seen interviews with those who worked on the show, a ""making of"" featurette, or a behind-the-scenes photo gallery. Hopefully, these are additions we will see on the many more episodes I pray will be released in the future.",1355011200,3,1428,5.177489177489178
5231717,5,B00914ETQW,"Danny Kaye was an American icon - though, sadly, unknown to today's TV and movie generation. He was not only a great movie actor (who over, 60 didn't grow up thinking Has Christian Andersen looked exactly like Kaye?) and comedian, but he was one of early television's top entertainers. He could sing, dance, do comedy sketches and pronounce some of the must difficult languages - including some he actually made up! And, I'm not even mentioning all the children's charity work he did for the United Nations. He was - like jazz legend Louis Armstrong (who co-starred with Kaye in the film ""The Five Pennies"") - a real Ambassador!

In the 1960s Kaye had a TV variety show - a genre that really no longer exists - and luckily he was able to preserve the videotapes. They are now owned - as far as I know - by his only child, Dena and this is what I certainly hope is the first in a series of DVD releases. 2012 marks the Kaye Centenary and, just in time for Christmas comes the DVD with two shows - a black and white one from 1963 and a color broadcast from 1966 - with a Christmas theme. But there are non-holiday songs and sketches as well. The ""name"" guests are Peggy Lee, Wayne Newton, Nat King Cole and Mary Tyler-Moore (MTM getting a chance to show off her dancing talent too), while you'll also recognize comedy ""second bananas"" Harvey Korman and Jamie Farr in the supporting cast in the comedy bits.

Other reviewers here have detailed each of the songs and sketches so I won't repeat them here. And I read some ""grumbling"" about the quality of the color transfers. I watched on my 30 year old 27in standard aspect TV and they looked fine to me. And, besides, these tapes are 50 years old. The entertainment value is there. The bonus feature is a seven-minute-plus excerpt from a 1965 episode of Kaye's show where he reads from Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"". The original hour-long shows have had the commercials removed and each runs about 45 minutes.

The first copy I received of the DVD had a ""glitch"" in the 1966 show at about the 35-minute mark - during a funny (and endearing) sketch about Christmas gifting. The sketch ended abruptly and went on to the next musical number. I noted that the ""time display"" moved forward about 5-minutes. I contacted the company and was sent a replacement that played perfectly.  So if you have this issue, I'll suggest that you contact the manufacturer, Inception Media Group at infoATinceptionmgDOTcom for a replacement DVD. They seem to be responsive.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Not sure if it was a malfunction of the specific dvd, my dvd player, or a ""oops"" in making the dvd (in which case a lot of people will not get to see the rest of that sketch like me).  Otherwise it was a great purchase!",1444435200,,384,4.0394736842105265
8533684,5,B00914ETQW,Danny Kaye was one of the greats!! He could do everything! If you love the old shows then you will have a ball! surely will bring back fond memories!,1420934400,,149,4.172413793103448
8533685,4,B00914ETQW,"Only saw a little bit of this as I gave it to Dad for Christmas, how could you not love Danny Kaye, but i guess it is a little dated now",1420243200,,136,3.4193548387096775
8533686,3,B00914ETQW,"I like Danny Kaye, but this DVD, Christmas with Danny Kaye, was very disappointing.  Although the show are episodes from his 1963 and 1966 Christmas shows featuring Nat King Cole, Mary Tyler Moore, Peggy Lee, and Wayne Newton, it was really boring and not very funny.  I wouldn't waste money or time on this DVD.",1419984000,,312,4.654545454545454
