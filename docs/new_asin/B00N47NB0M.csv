8676181,5,B00N47NB0M,Storyline not as predictable as one might think. A few songs. Typical cardboard acting from that era. Good family film.,1530403200,,119,5.0
8676182,5,B00N47NB0M,"Don't let the opening scene of *Buccaneer's Girl with the captain fool you... I almost turned it off because his face peeking in the ship's window looked so ridiculous.  I'm so glad I continued to watch this 77-minute movie.  This full color 1950 romantic adventure is an enjoyable experience featuring *Yvonne Di Carlo who plays a feisty, stubborn singer looking for a fresh start outside of Boston.  She has stowed away on a ship that gets overrun by pirates.  A couple of the pirates decide she might be worth keeping around much to Captain Baptiste's (played by Philip Friend) surprise.  There is a Robin Hood element to the movie, some cleverly snarky comments, enjoyable singing when entertainment is called for (so, no, it's not a musical; just musical entertainment), and a happy ending.  I enjoyed it and would watch it again.

Elsa Lanchester also stars as owner of ""Madam Brizar's School for Genteel Young Ladies ~ singing and dancing"".  Viewers may recognize her from other roles such as Bride of Frankenstein, 1935 or the sour Katy Nanna in Mary Poppins, 1964 and many more.

*Silly title since no one is ever called a buccaneer in the movie - The film was originally known as Mademoiselle McCoy and the Pirates, which certainly makes more sense, but is obviously too long.
**I would have never guessed it, but Yvonne De Carlo would later go on to play Lily Munster (and many other roles).",1529884800,,1402,4.784232365145228
