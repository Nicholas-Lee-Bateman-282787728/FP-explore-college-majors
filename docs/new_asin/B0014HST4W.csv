8255724,5,B0014HST4W,I seen this in subtitle...to understand it all a lot better English makes you more aware of the movie so thumbs up  for the English version,1527206400,,139,4.346153846153846
8255725,5,B0014HST4W,Really good movie never heard of it till my buddy told me about it.,1523750400,,67,3.857142857142857
8255726,5,B0014HST4W,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!,1520208000,,18,5.333333333333333
8255727,5,B0014HST4W,"Not a great movie but still a Japanese car culture classic! Well worth the time to watch and money spent if you're a Japanese car culture enthusiast. The ""Original"" Tokyo Drift!",1501286400,,177,4.741935483870968
8255728,5,B0014HST4W,"I thought I would only enjoy the cars. But I enjoyed the story and the characters as well. It is not exactly the same as the anime, but you can understand why the addapted characters like Bunta (although I think the photoshop of Bunta's young photograph terrible)",1498780800,,263,4.617021276595745
8255729,5,B0014HST4W,"Image is sharp! I was skeptical at first, but the risk was well worth it! the picture is amazing and the sound is great! Love how you can watch this in English! the packaging is really good too. Definitely buy this!",1467849600,,215,4.2682926829268295
8255730,2,B0014HST4W,"Loosely based on the anime, this movie seems like it was made by someone who briefly read/watched the show. Very disappointed.",1458950400,,126,5.0476190476190474
8255731,1,B0014HST4W,While I didn't buy this movie here I wouldn't recommend spending this much money on this s*** movie. If you want to know the whole story behind this movie watch the Anime they have a lot of characters missing and they made Bunta a drunk when in the Anime he is mainly a smoker and NOT an alcoholic he does drink but socially. And Itsuki in the Anime ISNT the son of the guy who runs the gas station. He's just another worker at the gas station though I have to give them credit for the actor of itsuki looking like he does in the Anime. Oh plus they left out Rysukes younger brother Keisuke who drives a yellow FD who was ACTUALLY the first guy Takumi raced. All in all the Anime is by far better if you want a live action version watch Fast and Furious Tokyo drift.,1451260800,,766,4.113333333333333
