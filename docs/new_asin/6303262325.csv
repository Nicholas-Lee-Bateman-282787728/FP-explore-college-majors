7842306,1,6303262325,"These ""actors"" threw on wedding bands to make their couplings seem legit, but the director obviously cared more about taut bodies than, oh, actual CHEMISTRY. I wasn't convinced that most of the actors felt much affection for their partners, and would have appreciated seeing *real* couples on screen. (And real settings - the antiseptic ""backdrops"" made it look like they were all making love in model-home showrooms.) Some spark of reality, some genuine emotion going on here, something!
Production values aside (oh god! forgot to mention the horrendously cheesy music), this video didn't illustrate anything new under the sun. If you've ever perused a Joy of Sex, you probably won't learn anything new from this video. A lot of time is spent on the importance of foreplay, with little time spent on position variations (what I'd really been interested in). There is nothing erotic about this video. If anything, it gave my husband and I a good laugh. (And he noted that some of the moans were dubbed.)
Save your money and buy Joy of Sex, or the Magic of Sex, instead (the books).",984528000,6,1081,4.880434782608695
7842307,1,6303262325,"I have no idea what this has to do with the Kama Sutra, but if you like porn, this is yours.  Don't watch this for sexual instruction, unless you need directions on how to market porn as a mainstream video.  The cast are  all interchangeable porn wannabes, especially the obviously augmented  blond.  As for the Indian girl mentioned in the other review, she looks  like she's enjoying this about as much as a root canal.  If it looks like  porn and sounds like porn, it's porn.",950227200,16,478,4.476744186046512
