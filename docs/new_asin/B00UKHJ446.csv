I had to laugh when I went to watch on Disc 10, 'Boot Hill Bandits' (1942) and actually watched a 1969 Italian 'Spaghetti Western' (as they were called back then) Movie called 'Boot Hill' of very poor quality. I am debating on return this purchase",1531094400,,331,4.338709677419355

8707209,1,B00UKHJ446,"I was hoping to own a lot of the ""John Wayne"" movies that I had seen, and liked, but that was not the case. I Returned it because I was so disappointed with the amount of ""actual John Wayne movies"" and the picture and sound was so bad on some of them that they were hard to watch.",1436054400,5,280,3.8448275862068964
