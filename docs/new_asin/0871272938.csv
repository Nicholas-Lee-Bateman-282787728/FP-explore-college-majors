7793214,5,0871272938,I am so happy that I could get this DVD for my personal collection. I can relate to the dances in the video.  It is a good timeline of ethnic dance(Black dance) in this country. This video brings back great memories.,1330214400,,216,4.2682926829268295
7793215,4,0871272938,"I saw this on PBS when it originally was shown and fell in love with it! When it re-aired I taped it on vhs. Even with its grainy shadowy quality I still have that tape at home! And cherish it all the more knowing that a VHS copy costs 89$. Any dancer, dance lover, history lover....MUST own this tape. Snippets of some of the best dancers, choreographers, dance companies in the world.",1328832000,,386,4.375
7793216,1,0871272938,"After receiving this item in damaged packaging (shipper's fault), I finally sat down to watch it and found that it would not play on any of my dedicated DVD players. I finally was able to watch it on my computer. The quality on a large screen was very poor. I decided to keep it only because I really love one of the companies performing. If you can locate an old videotape of this, copy it because that's what the distributor did and not very well. It most certainly is not worth the $44 that they are charging.",1321401600,3,512,4.288659793814433
7793217,5,0871272938,"I first saw this on PBS many years ago and have searched for it on DVD.  If you like Dance Theatre of Harlem and The Alvin Ailey dancers, you will LOVE Dance Black America.
The only question is who will be your favorite dancers.
I never forgot Charles Moore doing the Ostrich or the Fagan Dancers.
This is a must have for your Black Culture library.",1272844800,5,349,4.287878787878788
7793218,5,0871272938,My sister and I grew up watching this on a tape my dad recorded off of PBS 20 years ago. we've looked for it for years. I recomend it to anyone that loves theater.,1125446400,,163,3.823529411764706
