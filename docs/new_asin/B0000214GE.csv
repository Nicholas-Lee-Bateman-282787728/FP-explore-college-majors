1248055,3,B0000214GE,"I agree with one of the reviewers that the DVD version is not what you would expect.  The skits are shortened and edited rather quickly and it's dissapointing because some of the funniest moments in the skits are edited  out for time.  This amamzes me because it's DVD!  They can fit as much as  they want on it!  If you're looking for a condensed version of the best  skits of SNL, then get this disc.  If you want to experience it in the full  fashion, then wait.  Maybe they'll release the best of SNL 26 years next  year--hey, I can hope right!",948153600,6,548,4.2745098039215685
1248056,5,B0000214GE,"Being a semi-regular viewer of SNL, and having missed this when it was broadcast, I jumped at the chance to get it.  It is classic SNL, from the begining with Bill Murray as a host at an Indian Casino, to the intro by  Chris Rock who has the funniest line about SNL and movies, this is non-stop  laughs.  The show is broken up in 5 year segments with cast members from  those years introducing them.  There are retrospectives of the deceased  cast members with touching intoductions, the best by Jon Lovitz, followed  by a favorite skit.  The Weekend Update with all the anchor's was great.  The audience is star studded.  A well done very enjoyable program.  A  fitting tribute to a show that has been on the air for 25 years.  Billy  Crystal is hilarious interviewing audience members.",947721600,14,787,4.601449275362318
1248057,3,B0000214GE,"After seeing most of the Saturday Night Live 25th Anniversary Show, including some of my favorite clips, I thought this would be a great DVD to have.  I was somewhat surprised when I received my order that it contained  only 1 disk.  I wondered how a 4+ hour show could be condensed to one disk,  but since it was DVD, anything was possible.  The content on the disk is  NOT the complete show.  Many of the clips shown in their entirety where  greatly shortened.  While this is a nice remembrance of the 25th  anniversary show, don't buy it thinking all of your favorite clips will be  there whole.",947376000,40,598,4.444444444444445

1248073,5,B0000214GE,"Most major wrestling promotions these days don't last 10 weeks or 10 months let alone 10 years but Ring Of Honor was able to through the good & bad times leading to the company putting on this show as a celebration of that accomplishment with the nickname tagged ""Young Wolves Rising"" as the main event showcased the reputation that Ring Of Honor has in young stars of professional wrestling having the spotlight put on them.  It should be noted that this was the first event you started hearing the ""YES!"" chants in reference to WWE's Daniel Bryan (Bryan Danielson in ROH) and various stars would pay tribute to their past history of the promotion throughout the night with even a few surprise appearances.

All Night Xpress vs. Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team - This was ANX's Rhett Titus' first match back from his knee injury & surgery at the end of last year while WGTT was fresh off their heel turn at the previous PPV with their assault on the Briscoes with the chairs.  Both teams traded momentum early with Shelton having to resort to dirty tactics to gain an advantage only for ANX to get it back with moves like double suicide dives to the outside before WGTT came back with a blind side kick.  Titus was isolated for a majority of the match with his knee heavily worked over with moves like the figure four using the ringpost also WGTT used double teaming whenever possible on both members of ANX.  This wasn't the most competitive match they've had against each other but did a great job storytelling focusing on Titus due to his bad knee in what was overall a strong opening match.

Homicide vs. Mike Bennett - Homicide came out wearing his outfit from his early ROH days as part of the ""Natural Born Sinners"" bringing the beating to Bennett right away on the outside including biting & even taking out Brutal Bob as well before  Bennett was able to regain some control & ticking off the NYC audience as well with his treatment of some Yankees merchandise with Homicide making his comeback with moves like the STF & GTS.  Overall a solid match with even Maria getting involved as well.

Right around here was a special interview with the current Grand Champion of the Chikira promotion Eddie Kingston who was also a former member of the Ring Of Honor roster before he that was interrupted by Kevin Steen, who debuted a new introduction to his theme music that was a direct message to Davey Richards & Jim Cornette, that ultimately resulted in a huge brawl.

T.J. Perkins & Amazing Red vs. House Of Truth (Roderick Strong & Michael Elgin) - Red & TJP had the superior speed which they tried to use to their advantage with Red to focus on chopping Elgin down by going after his legs with dropkicks along with other offense like a double springboard body press & head scissors sending Strong to the floor.  H.O.T. used their power advantage with Elgin constantly catching them in mid-air to counter their offense with his own such as slams & powerbombs causing both TJP & Red to double team on the floor & in the air with a series of spinkicks, double flying dropkick, and twisting dives that even caught Truth Martini as well.  This was a hot match from start to finish that showcase each teams strengths (power & speed) with multiple series of moves & close near falls that was an impressive showing from both teams.

Television Champion Jay Lethal vs. Tomasso Ciampa - This was ""streak vs. title"" as Ciampa came into this match undefeated with the action starting off slow with various stalemates causing Ciampa to go to the floor whenever Lethal hit an offensive move causing Lethal to react with a suicide dive to the outside that hit R.D. Evans before Ciampa took advantage of the distraction.  Both men traded hits & counters with Ciampa blocking Lethal Injection with a blow to the stomach while Lethal caught Ciampa after doing his running knee in the corner one too many times.  The action really picked up towards the final moments left in the time limit with both men pulling out all of stops such as the top rope elbow, kryptonite crunch on the apron, and the Embassy LTD getting involved in the action.  The result was designed to continue to feud with both men looking strong in the process however the match itself kept a very slow pace until the final moments.

ROH Tag Team Champions Briscoe Brothers vs. Young Bucks - The Bucks get their title shot from winning the gauntlet match at the previous PPV and didn't waste any time as they attacked the Briscoes during the introduction only for the Briscoes to quickly recover & take the brawl to the outside using the guardrails to punish the Bucks.  The match officially started once they all got back into the ring with the Bucks resorting to double teaming to gain some momentum & singling out Mark Briscoe who was bleeding from the mouth.  Both teams went back & forth with the Briscoes resorting to their ""Jack Daniels Violence"" & ""Hillbilly Kung Fu"" while the Bucks relied on more impactful moves such as their various superkicks & high flying like the 450 splash while both teams weren't above double teaming whenever possible resulting in a good tag team encounter.

No Disqualification Match: Jimmy Jacobs vs. Kevin Steen - Jacobs wanted revenge for what happened to him & Steve Corino for what happened at Final Battle but Corino attempted to have the match stopped before it started by trying to talk to Steen only for Jacobs to attack & strip his outfit to showcase his jacket covered with Jay Briscoe's blood from his ""Age Of The Fall"" days of the past.  Both men brawled in & out the ring with them using whatever they could get their hands on such as Steen doing a codebreaker using a chair, Jacobs slamming him off the guardrail onto the stage ramp, and the guardrail used to be slammed & DDT'd on as the action got more intense with the ringside apron used for Steen to execute multiple powerbombs while Jacobs sacrificed himself spearing Steen that had both men going through a table.  The real story of the match took place with Jacobs reverting to his evil side in this match that he was trying to rehab himself & Corino from for the past few months only for him to go too far to the point where he couldn't believe what he done.  This was exactly what you expected coming into his match...a hardcore war.

Davey Richards & Kyle O'Riley vs. Eddie Edwards & Adam Cole - One half of the tag teams of ""American Wolves"" & ""Future Shock"" against their former partners in this main event based off the issues caused by O'Riley & Edwards and both of their associations with Davey.  Cole & Davey started out feeling each other out with some mat wrestling before their partners were tagged with all men attempting submissions on each other such as the kamora armlock, STF, and the ""Trailer Hitch"" leg submission while Davey was able to get a wheelbarrow & suplex combination on both Cole & Edwards.  The action picked up here as more submission attempts & counters were made between Kyle & Eddie such as the cross armbreaker, single leg Boston Crab, and crossface before both men engaged in a ""chop vs. kick"" battle that ended with a snap suplex that landed one of them right on the back of their head.  There was a nice sequence were Kyle hit some offense such a his triple butterfly suplexes into an armbar but Cole knew his former partner so well that he was able to roll it over into a pin attempt followed by a neck breaker that also had Kyle DDT his own partner in Richards in the process as both teams later showcased some teamwork such as a backpack chinbreaker that was followed by a top rope splash along with an anklelock & guillotine combination.  The competition got real heated between the former partners that saw their current partner get punished as a result of it such as when Davey & Eddie had half crabs face to face with each other, Adam & Kyle executing back suplexes, dueling fist & slaps, suplexes to the outside, and a battle of ""can you top this"" with the Wolves beating on Future Shock in separate corners.  As time went on, the action just got more impactful with action such as Kyle getting knocked out for a moment while Davey was hit so hard that his mouthpiece was knocked out, Edwards with a top rope frankensteiner that almost landed him on his neck, and a top rope tornado DDT that caused a crash landing through a table on the outside.  As if you can't tell from my review in this match, this was a highly competitive & intense main event that had all men looking strong coming out of it with the ""young wolves"" being elevated as singles competitors as it's possibly the best tag team main PPV event I've ever seen but stay tuned afterwords as a lack of respect was shown on more of than one occasion.

DVD extras include a ""poem"" by the Briscoes, bonus interviews with Steve Corino & Prince Nana & Adam Cole, and the highlight video of the first decade of Ring Of Honor.  As I stated when I reviewed the previous Final Battle PPV, I never had the opportunity to watch ROH before their recent TV deal with this being one of the first events of theirs I saw from start to finish, I felt like I got more than my money's worth (which was cheap compared to WWE & TNA) as every match was quality in it's own right so it's an event I would definitely pick up.",1351555200,,9274,4.5413669064748206
1248074,3,B0000214GE,"I have no problem with them not showing the full clips. The parts of the skits that they show are still funny. But it's not cool at all that they have lengthy tributes to Phil Hartman and Chris Farley, yet their so-called ""tribute"" to Danitra Vance was barely 30 seconds long! What's up with that? Vance worked on SNL during the 11th season, and was quite funny and talented. She suffered from dyslexia, which made it difficult to read from cue cards and memorize lines. But on she persevered. In 1994 she died of breast cancer at the young age of 40. But because she wasn't as popular as Hartman and Farley (who were fantastic legends and worthy of the praise, mind you), her tribute was relegated to a mere 30 seconds. So she wasn't on the show as long as they were. So she wasn't in as many sketches as they were. That's still elitist, coldhearted, and disappointing. Shame on SNL.",1325894400,,884,4.462962962962963

Of especial interest is a montage of opening title sequences plus highlights of a game Grifford selected as the best ever (up to '89): a 1978 back-and-forth battle between the Miami Dolphins and Houston Oilers that had several spectacular runs by Oilers Rookie of the Year recipient Earl Campbell. Also, 'Dandy' Don Meredith sings the entire first verse of Willie Nelson's ""The Party's Over"" and Howard 'the Mouth' Cosell tosses polysyllabics out like a cornucopia of seeds.

1248078,3,B0000214GE,"This was an uneventful anniversary. If you were expecting an entertaining reunion or funny new material, forget it. SNL legend Bill Murray's opening of the show is very inspired and warm as he is joined by Dan Aykroyd, Laraine Newman and Garrett Morris, evoking the great spirit the show once had. But this is where the fun stops.

The rest of the show is just compilations cobbled together from most of the series. They're mostly punchlines without the set-up. So they're usually funny only if you've seen the actual sketches. And before each batch of clips you get a lot of 1 to 2 minute intros that aren't very funny.

The tributes to the deceased castmates are just ordinary sketches where they were particulary amusing. But they could have found more somber, funny and appropriate tributes to the likes of John Belushi, Phil Hartman, Chris Farley and Gilda Ratner.

Lorne Michaels made sure to showcase the revolutionary show's most popular sketches and alumni but deny us the groundbreaking or controversial moments. He also chose quantity over quality. Its just a fastpace flipbook of moments, nothing too reflective or entertaining.",1246752000,2,1140,5.021164021164021

1248081,1,B0000214GE,"This DVD functions more or less as an advertisement for the other SNL DVDs that have been and continue to be marketed by NBC. The 25th anniversary special on this DVD lasts 2.5 hours, which sounds like a long time, but it's not long enough to do justice to the talent that appeared on the shows over such a long period of time. As uneven as the show was from week to week and year to year, there was still a lot of great material--far too much to cover in this format in any satisfying way. As a result, the clips that are shown are soundbites of soundbites--often, just enough to cover a famous quote (""wild an crazy guys,"" etc.) with a touch of lead-in. This may be enough to evoke a smile of nostalgia from someone who's seen the skits, but that's about it. When the skits were originally aired, they usually went on too long, but here the DVD's producers err by going way too far in the opposite direction. I'm not sure how you could do a worthwhile retrospective of 25 years worth of programming that would fit on one DVD, but if it can't be done... maybe one shouldn't do it.

The DVD comes with three ""extras"": an interview of Lorne Michaels by Tim Russert, which is mildly interesting; the ""day-after"" coverage of the 25th anniversary show by a heinous TV show I never heard of, ""Access Hollywood""; and promotional TV coverage by some other NBC news show, which featured clips that mostly overlapped with the special included on the DVD. Again I ask: Why put this material on a DVD? The so-called extras bring nothing to an already lackluster party.

All in all, disappointing.

By the way, for those who care, the Beastie Boys don't actually perform a number on the DVD. They play a couple of measures of one of their own songs before getting interrupted by Elvis Costello, and then they end up playing back-up for him.",1174348800,8,1828,4.467065868263473
1248082,4,B0000214GE,"I only started watching SNL in early 2001 after moving to the US from Britain, and hadn't heard much of it before then apart from knowing that was where the Blues Brothers movie etc had originated. I soon became an avid watcher, partly because of a teeny weeny crush on Tina Fey but also because I loved Will Ferrell and Jimmy Fallon, amd later on, Rachel Dratch and Amy Poehler.

I bought this DVD because I was keen to have a look for myself at some of the older stuff that other SNL fans were in raptures about. I have to say some of it was a bit dated, somewhat inevitably, but a lot of it was still very funny. I guess the people putting it together avoided topical political stuff, which quickly dates, although some of the stuff like impressions of various presidents holds up well.

On a slightly macabre level, I loved the opportunity to watch people who have since died, particularly the outstandingly charismatic performers such as John Belushi and Chris Farley. In fact, the funniest thing on the whole show for me was Chris Farley interviewing Paul McCartney - funny and sweet all at the same time!

The show is put together pretty smoothly, with current performers coming out and introducing each set of skits, which fits well with the DVD format since I can skip easily to the bits I regularly rewatch - I do think it could have been divided into shorter sections though. The introductions were quite variable in quality as other reviewers have pointed out, I was hoping for better things from Chris Rock and Adam Sandler for example. I was also a bit disappointed with the musical guests - it's a shame the Beastie Boys didn't get to play for real, and the Eurythimcs got too long, good though they were. I suppose the music had to a mix of up tempo and relaxing stuff to fit the mood of the show.

I really enjoyed the special features like the interviews with former cast members and with Lorne Michaels, and I loved watching all the stars turn up in their tuxedos and dresses - there was such a sense of anticipation beforehand! The atmosphere was clearly very convivial among the audience, one could tell that former anxieties and tensions were put aside for the evening and former cast members and writers were all very much aware that the show was much bigger than they ever were.

I really recommend this DVD for fans of SNL. Its the kind of show that you can dip into here and there according to your mood. Buy it and enjoy!",1146009600,,2448,4.492134831460674

The musical guests were excellent, and the tributes to the ones that have sadly passed on were touching and times very sad especially when Jon Lovitz can barely speak when having to give an intro to the memory of Phil Hartman because he is literally holding back tears.

This is a loving tribute to the first 25 years of SNL and I really do pray that it will go on for 25 more, and I really do think it will",1136678400,,549,4.130841121495327

1248085,3,B0000214GE,"This anniversary show was just okay the first time around-in 1989. That's right. If anyone taped that show(or owns it)there's a really good reason why THAT show, the 15th anniversary, isn't here-IT'S THE EXACT SAME SHOW!!! The 25th anniversary is not a taped rerun, mind you, but the EXACT same script(with minor changes in guests-which is understandable: some may not have been able to make this one). I thought that this was beyond surreal, when I first saw this one. I mean, it was down right just plain lazy on the writer's part. Am I the ONLY person to have caught this? Oh, brother!!! Anyway, since the 15th anniversary is no longer available here, no one else will ever know. Pathetic! As far as the show goes, itself, it's about as good-and bad-as the other criticism here explains. The only way to really view this is to check it out season by season, the way it was meant to be seen. I mean, they can stand on their own. Sadly, it'll only become more obvious that the writing became lazier-and less pointed-after the 70s. However, very little ever holds up to it's original incarnation-ie. original seasons(M*A*S*H, All in the Family, Star Trek, The Twilight Zone, Gunsmoke). There are fans for most of the seasons, though. Anyway, if there are completists for shows like ""X-Files"" and ""M*A*S*H"", there are surely those for this show.

1248086,5,B0000214GE,"A show like ""Saturday Night Live"" definitely deserves a special like the one it got for its 25th anniversary special. Stars from all walks of comedy showed up that night, bigger stars appeared and the late greats were payed tributes.

Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Will Ferrell, Molly Shannon, Kevin Nealon, Mike Myers, David Spade, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Garth Brooks and Chris Rock are just a few of the big stars on hand to celebrate the festivities this evening. Of the show's big stars, only Eddie Murphy and Dana Carvey are absent.

There are touching tributes to Chris Farley, Phil Hartman, John Belushi and Gilda Radner included. Gilda's is the best, as Cheri Oteri and Molly Shannon present the classic ""Nerds Make Out"" skit.

Also, there are great montages each representing a five - year period in the show's hsitory, as well as a hysterical ""Weekend Update"" montage.

The only thing not so good is the musical performances. I didn't like any of he oerformers. They could've had someone like Aerosmith or Billy Joel or Paul Simon perform or include the montage of msuical performances (there was one included when this was aired on television).

Other than that note, this is a great look at ""Saturday Night Live's"" first five years. Let's hope that a big bash is in store for the show's thrirtieth anniversary special.",1110844800,4,1348,4.894736842105263
1248087,4,B0000214GE,"O.k., except for the old farts who don't like profanity, the wheezer who only thought 20 minutes of it was entertaining and the chick who thought the intro was lame (Bill Murry's send-up of the reservation theme was genius), this is a very funny DVD. There are definitely some lame moments (David Spade's trying too hard to be `cooler than everyone else in the room' shtick), some painful moments (Adam Sandler's piece was embarrassingly horrible) and yet one more intensely boring musical piece from the lately ubiquitous Prince, whose own shtick of sexual ambivalence, wimpy voice and imminently forgettable tunes only rival his/her movie exploits for tedium.

Anyhow, although I think the MadTV folks do occasionally find a finer honed edge than the SNL crowd (and the first two seasons were consistently funnier), they are also taped and would have a hard time doing it live on a consistent basis. Like the ebb and flow of sun-spot activity, SNL has had good and bad casts, strong and weak seasons, but always has something going on that makes it worth while watching, and almost always pulls off one immensely funny skit during the evening. This is a collection of those efforts. Don't miss it. I just wish they would release the 15th anniversary taping. It was hilarious.",1100736000,6,1277,4.912037037037037

In short: vulgar, crass, lethargic, unfunny, unhip, eneven, assortment of pathetic bits that wouldn't make it past the first draft on Second City, Mad TV, or Sid Caesar.

The way it works for the most part is that for every half decade or so they have a segment of SNL clips. Of course, some chapters are better then others, because from what I know, NBC was about to cancel the show in the 80's, it got so bad, but the show is chock full of classics, such as the Adam Sandler Songs, the Eddie Murphy classics (like ""Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood""), and who could forget all those commercials? Some of the commercials shown are ""Schmitt's Gay"", ""Cluckin' Chicken"", and ""Oops, I Crapped My Pants"". There's even a ""Behind the Scenes"" roll which is awesome!!! Oh, I could ramble on about how great this DVD is all day!

The tributes were nicely done for Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Phil Hartman and my personal fave, Chris Farley.
All the favorites were in this 3 hour anniversary DVD.  Sprockets feat. Mike Myers, Dana Carvey as President Bush, Molly Shannon aka 'Superstar' and so many more.  I forgot just how funny the Weekend Update really was.  SNL has done a great job producing a weekly show and here's to another 25 years!",1067126400,,576,4.617647058823529
1248092,4,B0000214GE,"As with any collection or ""greatest hits"", it's very hard to make everybody happy. This SNL show is no exception to that rule.
There are great moments in this DVD, such as the participation of Billy Crystal, the opening skit with Bill Murray, the Q&A with Tom Hanks and a couple of the salutes to the different casts. Although short, the memorials for John Belushi and Chris Farley were great, however, they would've been better if they'd used more than just one skit (Belushi's ""Luck of the Irish"" banter and Farley's interview of Paul McCartney). Gilda Ratner's and Phil Hartman's memorials were not really what they deserved.
Also, there were a few missing castmembers, most specially Eddie Murphy, Dana Carvey, Christopher Guest and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.",1052352000,3,757,5.064
1248093,3,B0000214GE,"I didn't like this show as much as I thought I would, although I did still enjoy it.
I appreciated that they took the time to honor the lesser-known SNL players who have since passed away (Michael O'Donoghue and Danitra Vance) as well as the famous ones (John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Phil Hartman, & Chris Farley).
However, I thought the memorials for John, Gilda, Phil & Chris could have been better done. For example, in the 20th anniversary show, Dan Aykroyd & Jim Belushi spoke, and they showed clips of John's most famous and well-loved characters. This time around, it was Dan and Larraine Newman, who joked about selling Belushi stuff on eBay. The only clip was John's ""luck of the irish"" rant on Weekend Update. Granted, some of his other work was shown when they highlighted the cast from 1975-1980, but it still felt like a  hastily done memorial.
Gilda's memorial was along the same lines, being introduced by Molly Shannon and Cheri Oteri, and consisting of a Nerds sketch. Both women said some nice things about Gilda being a groundbreaker for female comedians.

The memorials for Phil and Chris were more heartfelt (Jon Lovitz for Phil and David Spade for Chris), almost to the point of being difficult to watch, because the intros were so emotional. The wounds from these two recent (at the time) and sudden deaths have obviously not healed, and it seemed a shame to make their friends and colleagues tearfully mourn their friends on live TV.
Moving on to the musical guests...SNL has had many, many famous acts over the years, but instead of being shown clips from the best known and/or most notorious, there were instead performances by the Eurythmics, the Beastie Boys, and others who don't spring to mind, because they were kind of lost in the shuffle of clips. The performances were good, don't get me wrong, but I think the show could have done more to acknowledge and highlight some of the other performances over the years.
The patter of the various hosts who introduced the series of clips was, for the most part, funny, with many nods to the famous people in the audience. Some people didn't get enough to say (Steve Martin) and some people got way too much (Adam Sandler). That contributed to the uneveness of the program. It's fun to watch if you've been a long time fan, but it doesn't give as complete a history of the show as it should, or even as previous anniversary shows have done.",1051488000,,2414,4.691037735849057
1248094,3,B0000214GE,Haven't seen this DVD but this review mentioned in a negative way my favorite actress Sarah Michelle Geller & I would love to get a copy of Sarah's appearences on SNL.

1248095,4,B0000214GE,"I have read other customer reviews complaining about how several skits were cut short. While I completely agree with them, I still say this is a very funny DVD, a close second to the TV program itself. My biggest complaint along those lines was the Jeopardy skit with the Sean Connery impersonation. This was hysterical on TV. Why did they cut some much of that one out, I will never know!
Nevertheless, I highly recommend this DVD. There were many funny skits that did not have as much cut out. And the picture/audio quality were awesome.

But, when the show was good, it was really good. And, of course, many of the most brilliant comedians came from this show. Pretty damn good. This long show is filled with the show's best, funniest, and most classic scenes. It's also filled to the brim with cast members and people who have hosted. There are also performances by Al Green, Eurythmics, and Elvis Costello. The show gets emotional when they pay tribute to cast members who've passed away : Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Chris Farley, Phil Hartman, and Danitra Vance. It's one funny moment after another. It's also nice to know that the show has gotten back on it's feet here in the last few years, thanks to Will Ferrell, Cheri Oteri, Molly Shannon, and others.

1248100,2,B0000214GE,"Let me start by stating that I am a huge fan of SNL. The DVD is funny, at times very funny, but there are some problems. The skits that they show mainly last about 15 seconds. Just when you get rolling with your favorite skit, and start remembering it they shoot to the best scene of another skit, not giving you a chance to enjoy them. Another problem is that this was taped in front of a large audience of today's stars (Tom Hanks, Sarah Michelle Gellar etc.) and when they are playing the clips from past episodes the laughter from the audience TOTALLY drowns out the sound of the skit resulting in alot of missed words and ""what did he say""'s. This in my case is very dissapointing, especially due to the fact that as I mentioned earlier the skits last 10-15 seconds, and when you miss 5 seconds of a skit due to laughter it doesnt leave much more to enjoy. When making the DVD they should have surpressed the live audience track alot, but I am not sure if thats possible. All in all its not a bad DVD, but surely not what I expected. I don't plan to watch it again :-(",989971200,28,1073,4.213592233009709
1248101,4,B0000214GE,"This disc boasts an impressive collection of highlights from the SNL archives, joined together by (for once) some actually funny links. Tom Hanks is the foil of a tried-and-true SNL convention--the host interrupted  by audience members--that brings out the comedic best in Jon Lovitz and  Christopher Walken. (By the way, if you missed this year's Walken-hosted  show, be sure to catch it in rerun. It was the best of the season so far.)  The show even contains some sentimental tributes to departed performers.  The beauty of these is that they are all done tastefully and they are, if  you are old enough to appreciate them, quite moving. The live musical  performances are quite good, particularly Elvis Costello backed by the  quite intent Beastie Boys. So good, in fact, that by the time this lengthy  (but never long) show ends, you might not even realize that the DVD does  not include the musical highlight segments that were part of the original  telecast. Too bad, otherwise this would be a five-star disc. There is one  segment included in the program that did not make it to air--an interesting  behind-the-scenes look at the creation of a show. This may not be a disc  you'll watch often, but it's an excellent sampling of what is now--gasp!--a  TV institution. And that's not a put-down.",956620800,13,1301,4.876712328767123
1248102,5,B0000214GE,"How many Saturday Night Live alumni can you think of right off the top of your head?  How many of their skits can you remember?  How many movie-spin offs?  If you are like many Americans, you can probably rattle off many of  these figures.  After 25 years, it is quite an impressive resume.
This  25th anniversary retrospective is filled to the brim with star power.  From  Chevy Chase to Molly Shannon, all generations of SNL personnel were  represented in person, along with frequent guest-hosts like John Goodman  and Steve Martin.
You won't find your favorite skits in their entirety  in this compilation, nor will you see the same tired episodes of the famous  recurring characters.  Instead, there are five extended montages of each  five-year period since SNL's initial broadcast.  The skits are edited down,  but in many cases, that is a blessing - we all know that some of them go on  a lot longer than they should.
Along with these montages come the  memorial segments.  For each departed cast member, a skit highlighting  his/her work was presented in its entirety.  They were truly funny people.  Also included in this retrospective were highlights from ""Weekend Update""  and some of the most memorable commercials.
The funniest new moments of  the evening came during Bill Murry's lounge style introduction, and Billy  Crystal's ""mavalus"" chit chat.  It is hard to work an audience of your  peers, and they did it better than the rest.
If you missed this when it  was aired last fall, this is a must see.",954892800,37,1517,4.8203125
1248103,5,B0000214GE,"Amidst the perennial criticism of _Saturday Night Live_, it's easy to forget just how big an impact the show has had on our national artistic identity.  This retrospective is a great place to begin that (re)discovery.  Through its vast collection of clips from the show's 25-year run, one  gains a real appreciation of the hundreds of colloquialisms, impressions,  and comedic commentary this program has added to our national identity.
What makes this show uniquely satisfying, however, is that it has  significant original programming, including remarkable new material from  Billy Crystal, Tom Hanks, Bill Murray, Mike Meyers, Robert Smeigel, various  ""Weekend Update"" anchors, and the Eurythmics.
There's also a  fascinating montage on the production of a typical episode of SNL.  True,  this segment is in some ways cleverly-edited eye candy, but to my  knowledge, it's the only SNL-produced filmed exposition of the backstage  process at SNL. (There are three press bits on the DVD-version of the  product which greatly amplify one's appreciation of the show, but SNL  itself has still not produced a significant exploration of its own  machinations.)
It is a difficult thing, I would imagine, to make an  anniversary show where so much material already exists.  The temptation for  Lorne Michaels was probably to air many more clips than his staff ended up  including.  For every bit that was included, there were at least five that  I personally might have included as well.  What Michaels and company were  going for, though, was not an anthology, but an anniversary party.  And  that's what they ended up with.  The show is in no way like the ""Best  of [insert performer's name here]"" series that SNL has recently been  releasing.  You won't find this to be a exhaustive  record of any aspect of  the SNL experience.  You won't even find that many complete sketches here.  And you certainly won't discover anything but oblique references to the  show's colorful off-screen history.  Rather, _SNL 25_ very much feels as  though they've gathered a few hundred of their closest friends (some of  whom pointedly refused to show up) and have said ""Hey, remember when  we did this?""
Happily, not only do we remember how good they were,  this anniversary special lets us see how good they still are.",953078400,46,2302,5.06970509383378
