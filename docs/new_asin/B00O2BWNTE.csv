bad  illusions, good  illusions, nonsense. And its up to us, customers, to connect  with illusion. As his illusions not
connected to real life  at  all  I  prefer  Joe D'Amato  and  Jess Franco.",1481241600,,315,4.884615384615385

6704129,5,B00O2BWNTE,"At $11 this was a throwaway unbelievable price (even with some bad reviews). Already had a great Allen collection of older films, but this was an opportunity to update. All of the DVDs were genuine and work great. No problems whatsoever. Or I guess, the problem was once I started watching some of these to check that they worked found it hard to stop. Woody Allen is a superlative movie maker, and hard to believe he is still going strong. These newer films are some of his best. Just finished catching up on the Amazon Prime Video series Crisis in Six Scenes and Caf Society. Cannot wait for more.",1479513600,5,599,4.504587155963303

8681598,5,B00O2BWNTE,"Whatever Works (2009)
You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010)
Midnight in Paris (2011)
To Rome With Love (2012)
Blue Jasmine (2013)

This set exceeded my best expectations.

It is a key virtue of Woody Allens work, as I should now know, but I especially exulted in the variety among these almost immediate successive five screenplays.  Of the five, the one which I liked least (which is unnecessarily negative) was You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger.  It is the weak one of this handful, in the way that a B+ paper is weak compared to a quartet of As.  The engine for both You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger and Blue Jasmine is, the unpredictability of relationships, how we make such an effort to find the right person, but how some portion of that endeavor is just plain out of our control.  (We might say that the same theme runs through Whatever Works, but in the context of a giddy comedy.)  In different environments, the poignancy of both You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger and Blue Jasmine comes from the relationships, and the people, which/who at the end are to some degree broken, and the open question of whether they can (and how they should) mend.  Perhaps they are both variations on the same theme of Annie Hall;  but there is no retread  there is inexhaustible discovery.

Whatever Works is brilliant and witty.  Could not stop chuckling.

In an environment (cinema) where two successive movies on a similar theme too frequently suggest the ham-handed use of a cookie-cutter, Allen achieves a tour-de-force in making the two travelogue movies, Midnight in Paris and To Rome With Love  absolutely different, in spite of the superficial similarity of at least one element:  American parents coming to a European capital for the engagement/wedding of their daughter.  Exquisitely delightful, both of them.

Marvelous screenplays, marvelous casts.",1523577600,2,1862,4.86031746031746
