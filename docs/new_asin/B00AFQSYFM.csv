5423659,5,B00AFQSYFM,"Really enjoyed this movie. I have been an Elmore Leonard fan for years, and always wondered why this novel wasn't made into a movie until I realized that it is a big undertaking...action, laughs, characters...so it required someone to come along with the cojones to do it! This was, like the book, a GREAT RIDE! Get it while you can at this amazing price! Cheaper than a movie ticket!",1361750400,9,384,4.579710144927536
5423660,5,B00AFQSYFM,"This is something that only a skilled Director would tackle. Charlie Matthau used his same style he did, as with 'The Grass Harp', even though Freaky deaky is an entirely different genre. This is similar to Frank Capra's work, no matter what Frank did, you could tell ""Capra' did it.  By far, anything Charlie directs, has his touch on it.",1361750400,10,339,4.65
5423661,5,B00AFQSYFM,LOVED THE MOVIE.  I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG FAN OF THE BOOK AND WAS VERY HAPPY HOW IT TRANSLATED TO FILM.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO EVERYONE.  DEFINITELY WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION.,1361750400,9,188,4.314285714285714
5423662,5,B00AFQSYFM,"Well, as mentioned, I cannot wait to see it. Charlie is a great director and know the word ""entertain'!!!!! I am also a big fan of Crispin since ""Back to the future,"", he was also great in the remake ""Willard,""",1358899200,9,210,4.275
5423663,5,B00AFQSYFM,I can't wait to see this movie! Charles Matthau is a marvelous director and I can't wait to see his depiction of the novel. Pre-ordering NOW!,1358640000,6,141,4.461538461538462
5423666,3,B00AFQSYFM,I liked the movie but for some reason the film kept pausing and this made it frustrating to watch. Needs to be checked out.,1397952000,,123,4.166666666666667
5423667,4,B00AFQSYFM,"it's got it all if you like exploitation films like black dynamite, but don't really want to exploit anyone :)",1395532800,,110,4.55
5423668,3,B00AFQSYFM,"I only purchased this because I was in it!  I worked as an extra - I was one of the cops who lifted the police line for the Billy Butler character as he walked to a crime scene.  As for the film itself, it was ok.  Goofy, relatively well written, directed, and acted, but not a masterpiece.",1389052800,,290,4.052631578947368
5423669,5,B00AFQSYFM,"I downloaded ""Freaky Deaky"" from my Netflix account and watched it the other night.  The movie was funny and like stepping back into the '70's again.  I thought the acting was really good and recognized Billy Burk from ""Revolution"" on TV; but what really caught my attention was how well the film was made to be what I assume was low budget. I recommend it if you like comedy.",1381968000,2,376,4.434782608695652
5423670,4,B00AFQSYFM,"Let me preface my review by saying my taste in movies is a bit quirky. But I really, really liked this movie. Great casting, story, and setting. If you are a fan of Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown, you will appreciate this movie too.",1380758400,3,230,4.25
5423671,5,B00AFQSYFM,"I love this movie of this great but not very well known Elmore Leonard story ""Freaky Deaky"". Very well done from beginning to end. Although I know the film lost some major actors at the last minute, the actors in the final cut are fantastic. My favorite is Michael Jai White. He is as talented as he is handsome! He is able to bring both 70's campiness and sincere depth to his character. His comedic timing balanced with dramatic flair is perfection.
The film is compelling, funny, suspenseful, visually fun, and simply very well done. I also appreciated that all of this varied entertainment was created without having to lean on showing gratuitous overdone violence. This film succeeds in using imagination where Tarantino's overly gratuitous violence and gore always fail.
You can enjoy Freaky Deaky with your adolescent children without concerns. The movie captures a lot of the wild fun and fabulous fashion of the 70's.
Christian Slater does not disappoint. He returns to movies with a delicious take on the main character. I highly recommend buying this totally entertaining and special movie. The director, Charlie Matthau did a brilliant job!",1378684800,2,1152,5.036649214659686
5423672,5,B00AFQSYFM,Charlie Matthau is a fine director and this is a very entertaining ninety minutes of top shelf entertainment. I recommend it highly.,1376697600,2,132,5.045454545454546
5423673,3,B00AFQSYFM,"I like the 2012 caper film FREAKY DEAKY, based on the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name, well enough to recommend it.  Stylish and fast-paced, FREAKY DEAKY held my attention even if I did not get into it as much as I did viewing, say, GET SHORTY, to name another movie version of a Leonard book. But the reason I say that is part of what I admire about FREAKY DEAKY: I was not sure whom to root for/root against. I give the flick credit for challenging the audience to make up its mind instead of having the movie do it for them. Maybe had its bigger schemers, played by Michael Jai White and Breanne Racano, had more screen time I would have been more caught up in it.

As FREAKY DEAKY takes place in the year 1974, in the background of a couple of scenes you'll note movie theaters playing films starring director Charles Matthau's famous dad, THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE and THE FRONT PAGE.

With dynamite being a favorite tool of FREAKY DEAKY antagonists, it must have been hard to resist using a clip of the then-hit television show GOOD TIMES, with its ""Dy-no-mite"" catchphrase.",1371600000,4,1095,4.437810945273632
5423674,5,B00AFQSYFM,"Fun, fabulous and deliciously Freaky Deaky this film should be on everyone's viewing list thanks to the  wonderful performances of a stellar cast under the direction of the spectacularly talented Charles Matthau!",1371081600,2,212,5.625
5423675,5,B00AFQSYFM,"master piece of film making with an impeccable eye for directing, makes you want to laugh out loud.can not wait to see it again!",1370390400,3,128,4.375
5423686,5,B00AFQSYFM,"I loved the film.  It was a fun ride and i would definitely watch this again - thought the acting was strong and I love Elmore Leonard.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freaky-Deaky/dp/B00BLSR4EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freaky Deaky</a>. Watch and have fun!!!!!",1369872000,2,300,7.571428571428571
5423687,1,B00AFQSYFM,"I wanted to like this.  I remember Matthau's son from his appearance in House Calls and I wished him well.  I also love Elmore Leonard.  Unfortunately, Leonard provides a decent plot, a series of memorable characters and (as always) crisp, pitch-perfect dialogue.  The director took the magic and turned it into 88 minutes of tedium and general silliness.  The pace is wrong; the characters are wrong; the script is limp.  Crispin Glover is a slow-mo train wreck and the seventies' ethos is little more than costume-deep.  The Mankowski character's magnum shoots seven rounds and by that point we hardly care.

I wish I could have liked it, but this one is a turkey from the first gobble.",1366934400,2,688,4.82051282051282
5423688,5,B00AFQSYFM,"Freaky Deaky, the last great novel not to be filmed, is a film that is true to Detriot during the 70s.  The acting is great, performers are fun to watch, and although there are a few topical drug and sex jokes, it is a nice small film that is entertaining and easily watchable over and over again.  Highly recommended.",1366675200,5,318,4.372881355932203
5423689,2,B00AFQSYFM,"I actually liked the cast and the acting. However  for a film that is supposedly placed in the early seventies they had a huge problem with props, costumes and location continuity to the time.

The women's make up, hair and clothes were wrong for the era. In some shots the cars in the background are clearly from the 2000's. There was a scene also that included film equipment that didn't exist for another twenty years.

I fault the director for these oversights. I also fault him for not studying the films of the era nor the filming techniques/ cinematography. If you are going to make a grind house flick knockoff, know your  history.

I didn't even go into the pacing of the script. It's all over the place.  Pretty sure Elmore Leonard  must have stopped back from this hot mess and just walked straight to the bank to cash the rights check they gave him.

Save your money on this and look for much better films of Loenard's writings.",1366156800,2,940,4.520710059171598
5423690,5,B00AFQSYFM,Charles Matthau hit the nail on the head with this cool adaptation of Elmore Leonard's Freaky Deaky.  Breanne Racano and Christian Slater deliver magnetic performances under Matthau's unique interpretation of America in the 1970s.  Michael Jai White and Billy Burke are also superb.  Definitely worth the purchase price and highly recommended.,1365638400,4,343,5.686274509803922
5423691,5,B00AFQSYFM,"Watching with friends is highly recommended.  The plots unfold like the book with new twists along.  It was good entertainment, made me want to join a party like this.  And I learned something new too by watching this movie.  go have fun",1364601600,5,237,4.571428571428571
5423692,5,B00AFQSYFM,A petal to the metal fun filled Elmore Leonard film which is pure superb entertainment for all!!!!  Crispin Glover is wonderful and Michael Jai White steals the show!!!,1364601600,4,168,5.0
5423693,3,B00AFQSYFM,"I really liked the opening credits which set the time period of the movie nicely.  Crispin Glover kind of steals the movie with his portrayal of Woody, who is a more peripheral character in the book.  I thought the movie was a different but complementary take on the book and I liked them both.",1364515200,3,294,4.425925925925926
5423694,2,B00AFQSYFM,"Freaky Deaky was, at one time, my favorite Elmore Leonard book. The rhythm of the movie just didn't work. I was disappointed.",1364083200,2,125,4.7272727272727275
5423695,2,B00AFQSYFM,"I love a good grindhouse. Heck I even love a mediocre grindhouse. This one didn't make it, and it wasn't just because Christian Slater was in it. The film starts in 1975 then plays newsreel headlines from 1968-1975 just to let us know the writers didn't care about details. We are then fed a story that is highly improbable. All this is find and well for a grindhouse.

What this story lacked was the grindhouse soundtrack and over the top dialouge. Instead they feed us a tale of Woody (Crispin Glover) a rich stoner accused of rape by a woman (Sabina Gadecki) that wasn't sure he actually raped her. The investigator (Billy Burke) gets kicked off the force, but that didn't seem to be a plot point, just an attempt at humor. Meanwhile seductive Robin (Breanne Racano) is after the money and utilizes bomb expect Skip (Christian Slater) to assist her.

The film has a lot of drug use, but lacks decent drug humor. The humor wasn't crude or low brow, it just wasn't well written and executed, lacking zing and delivery. While people get killed in this wannabe grindhouse, there is no blood or fight scenes associated with such features. The movie is out right lame compared to how it is being promoted.

If you like a modern unrealistic view of the 70's in Detroit with substandard writing and performance, you might want to rent this film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, lame sex scenes, no nudity.",1363564800,,1393,4.650406504065041
5423706,5,B00AFQSYFM,A great movie from Ellmore Leonard's book. The movie stayed pretty true to the book.  Any movie from a Leonard book is going to be good.  Entertaining fun.,1363564800,9,155,4.5
5423707,5,B00AFQSYFM,"I really liked this movie. To be honest, I have never seen any other movies directed by Charlie Matthau. And, I did not read the book Freaky Deaky so I cannot compare the movie to the book. But, Charlie did a great job directing this movie. I liked the chapter points throughout the movie as if I was reading the book. The story flows really well. The actors that are cast are perfect and do an excellent job. The one thing I liked is there is no nudity in this movie. The lead character now works in the sex crimes department of the police department so I thought there might be nudity, but Charlie directs the story around it perfectly, but keeps it right there. Plus, in one scene he gives a shout-out to his dad, Walter Matthau. I think I will now get another Charlie Matthau movie, The Glass Harp through netflix. Great job directing this Charlie.",1363305600,5,852,4.39873417721519
5423708,5,B00AFQSYFM,"Crispin Glover, is perfect. Loved the book, love the movie even more. Bravo! Stylish and moody, with a strong feeling of absurdity.",1361923200,14,131,5.0
5423709,5,B00AFQSYFM,Glover knocks it out of the park as a zonked out hippy druggie with cold hard cash perfect to take.,1361836800,13,99,4.0
5423710,3,B00AFQSYFM,"Easy to watch. Fun neo-noirish dark comedy. Good to see Crispin Glover doing his usual unusual thing. And the chicks are hot, heehee! Don't worry about negative reviews, just take it for what it is. A simple, fun romp. Not up to Guy Ritchie pace, but still keeps you interested. Well done, Charlie.",1361836800,8,298,4.6415094339622645
5423711,1,B00AFQSYFM,"This is a very poor imitation of other Leonard adaptations. The dialogue is stilted, the acting basic and the set pieces plastic. Parking a few old cars around and renting from some 70s party store costumes is no replacement for look and feel. I had to quit after 20 minutes it was getting on my diddies so much. Take my advice. Save your rental money. I want my $4.99 and 20 minutes back Direct TV!",1361836800,5,399,4.333333333333333
5423712,4,B00AFQSYFM,Freaky Deaky is another movie on a long list of films based on an Elmore Leonard novel. Thankfully Freaky can hang out near the top. I found it quite entertaining. While Christian Slater was strong in the lead the most memorable moments are when Crispin Glover or Michael Jai White- or both- were on screen. It's well worth the watch!,1361836800,9,334,4.583333333333333
5423713,5,B00AFQSYFM,"It's hard to get the Elmore Leonard tone right. Justified does it for the most part, Out of Sight did it extremely well, and this falls right in line with those. Amazing cast, quirky characters, surprising left turns, this movie has it all.  And oh, the set design! Fun, fun stuff.",1361750400,11,281,4.509803921568627
5423714,5,B00AFQSYFM,"What a fantastic movie!  Freaky Deaky is amazing and very entertaining.  Director Charlie Matthau dit it again.  Very few movies are as good as the book however this one hit the mark,  Don't walk run to get this movie.  You will thank me.",1361750400,14,238,4.441860465116279
5423715,5,B00AFQSYFM,Read the book. this movie follows right along. They did very well to stay true to the text. Have to watch it twice to get the full effect.,1361750400,10,138,3.9642857142857144

8551052,4,B00AFQSYFM,Although it followed the book surprisingly well . . .and all of the characterizations did credit to Elmore Leonard's creations . . .the ending was confusing at best.  I got the impression that the editors came up short of footage in the final cut and had to engage in some very clunky cutting that was not up to the quality of the rest of the film.,1441497600,,348,4.2727272727272725
8551053,5,B00AFQSYFM,"I recommend this movie for all Elmore Leonard fans who enjoy the colorful and rich language.  It's a whole new way of communicating and is lots of fun.  I first started enjoying it in the ""Justified"" series on TV.",1430697600,,213,4.435897435897436
8551054,3,B00AFQSYFM,"Unfortunate parody but great whack scenery chewing by Christian Slater and superb FREAKALISHUS arthouse nuthouse scene-stealing by eccentric pill poppin' millionaire Crispin Glover. Gritty, stormy-browed Billy Burke was refreshingly dry and high contrast to this movie's non-stop highjinks. But I watched it to complete my Elmore Leonard viewing, after reading most of the late great author's funny, anti-noir crime novels. JACKIE BROWN's a better movie by a factor of oh, a billion, so's GET SHORTY.

But to see Slater and Crispin Glover in their most over-the-top, hey, did-I-just-see-him-do-that? roles, give this a whirl. A big negative: clueless parody of the big-hearted spirit of '60s activism that seemed both flatly unimaginative and mean-spirited at the same time in this weird film. I'm going to read the book and see where author Leonard, who for about 15 years was my go-to fun empty calorie read, actually took that topic.",1425600000,,936,5.36734693877551

8551059,2,B00AFQSYFM,"I expected more from this movie. The book that it was made from is one of Elmore Leonard's favorites.
