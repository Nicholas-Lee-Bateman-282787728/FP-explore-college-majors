7855217,4,6303855393,"Bruce Payne (Warlock III, Ravager, Howling 6) is a great B-movie bad guy.  But in this one, he's the hero and he does a good job. Payne plays a jet pilot who wrote the book on flying. He's a family man and loves his country. That's why when he is called to action, he goes for it. Co-star Lance Henriksen (Hard Target) turns in a performance he has mastered as the man-behind-the-scenes. There is also a cameo part of an aircraft navigator done by Corben Bernsen (Major League).This is a low-budget film but it has what it takes to keep you interested. Worth a look.",1003622400,,566,4.390476190476191
