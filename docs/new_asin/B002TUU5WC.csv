8380671,5,B002TUU5WC,I was hoping for more upbeat Irish reels but their are enough. Mostly folk songs in what I would call an Austin city limits type setting. Just a few simple camera angles without the flashing from camera to camera every 3 seconds as most producers do to concert DVDs. Other than too many fades from one camera angle to another it is well done. Nice songs by good musicians. I have 100+ dvd concerts I play in my store.  The simple filmed concert like this one are my favorite. If you like Austin city limits you will like this show. I have often seen people that are unknown to me put on great shows. This is one of them.,1471564800,,620,4.2100840336134455
