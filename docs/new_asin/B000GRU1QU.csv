8134259,5,B000GRU1QU,We really enjoyed this cute Easter video. The bugs tell the Easter story and use catchy songs to help. My 2 year old watched it over and over. I would recommend it for children 2-4. It might not hold the attention of older children due to the simplicity of the storytelling and songs.,1428969600,,284,4.377358490566038

8134261,5,B000GRU1QU,"I purchased this DVD for our children's liturgy program at church.  Before I used it there I wanted to review it, so I popped it in our DVD player at home.  My two boys, aged 5 and 8, had been playing.  They stopped and were entranced by this DVD.  They watched the whole thing, then wanted to watch it again!  I loved the simplified stories, good for young children and still got the message across.  The songs and games in between the stories were fun for my kids and for the kids in the children's liturgy program at church.  I use the stories and the songs from the DVD and the accompanying booklet when I lead a liturgy that is based on those scripture readings.  Since younger children are sensory learners the music, song lyrics, visuals, and interactive games tap into all their senses for better overall understanding.  Very good supplement!",1231200000,2,850,4.576158940397351
