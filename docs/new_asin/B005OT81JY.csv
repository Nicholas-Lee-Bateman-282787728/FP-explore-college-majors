4854554,3,B005OT81JY,"I give this film three stars and that's only for the shots of the old MGM Backlots. If the film was just about that it would get a 5. A silly version of Phantom of the Opea is built around the destruction of a ficticious old Hollywood studio but we all know it's MGM. I'm sure they thought they were just cashing in on the removal of the sets for another quickie TV movie, but what they have done is preserve the moment in time for us MGM Buffs. Thank you.",1342224000,,456,4.021978021978022

But this TV movie is for all fans of the great TV movies and of old classic horror mystery movies. It not only has a masked killer it
has all the same kind of mystery and good 'old' horror you expect. You also get to see all the old movie sets used in all the classic
TV and movies from old Hollywood which were torn down and destroyed shortly after movie was made. It's great to see them. It
also has great actors like Jack Cassidy and Peter Haskell and even Uncle Fester from Adams Family. The story is pretty simple
a old has been actor is killing off movie executives dressed as a masked killer called the Phantom of Hollywood. If they made it
today it would be just another gory slasher sex over produced special effects bomb called Phantom of Hollyweird with bad acting.
Also features Peter Lawford and Broderick Crawford in small parts. And the cars of the 70's too! what a great time in America!",1330128000,2,1037,4.269035532994923
4854556,3,B005OT81JY,"It's 1973, and Worldwide Studios is selling their backlots, since shooting has moved to real locations. However, there is a secret resident,a former actor, living underground on one of the backlots. He's disturbed. He doesn't want them sold, and he's not afraid to kill those who do. The movie is filmed, almost entirely, in Culver City, on the sets and backlots of MGM. In the beginning, the camera pans across decrepit and decaying buildings of the backlot, then cuts to actual movie scenes where the buildings were used, oh so long ago. Clips include shots from ""Dinner at Eight(1933)"" and ""Grand Hotel(1932)"". A 1973 made-for-TV movie, ""Phantom of Hollywood"" begins well, but soon slips into police-chase melodrama, as cops and studio heads hunt for the killer. The movie is saved by a great performance from Jack Cassidy, in a dual-leading role. Hollywood veterans in the cast include Jackie Coogan, Broderick Crawford, John Ireland, Peter Lawford, John Lupton, Regis Toomey, Bill Williams, Elisha Cook, Jr., and Kent Taylor, a long-time B-picture actor, who has no dialogue. The movie's ending literally documents bull-dozers smashing down weather-worn castles and building-fronts from the European village; all leveled in 1973 so that owner Kirk Kerkorian could convert the backlot to condominiums and finance his Las Vegas MGM Grand. Warner Archives and MGM did nothing to restore this film. Colors are spotty, and reds are often washed-out into pink. Jack Cassidy's idol was John Barrymore, whom he played in ""W.C. Fields and Me(1976)"". Several photos of Cassidy used in the film have him posed with his left profile, ala Barrymore. Jack Cassidy died in 1976, in a fire in his 4th floor penthouse on North Kings Road, in West Hollywood. The Fire Department found a smoldering cigarette. Cassidy had been smoking in bed.",1329523200,,1828,5.158249158249158
4854557,5,B005OT81JY,"OK, it's a hokey not-very-good movie BUT there are many scenes of the bulldozing of the ""permanent"" standing sets on the historic backlots of MGM--movie was filmed amid the actual demolitions WHILE they were taking place! Also, there is a cool splicing-in of scenes of these iconic sets AS they were originally seen on film, with clips that compare the present with the past, etc. Sad. Oh so sad, but awesome to witness this historic event--The End Of An Era...",1317081600,5,461,4.775

8481841,5,B005OT81JY,"The studios were divesting themselves of their backlots as audiences demanded location shooting and property prices soared.  Someone had the inspired idea to use this for a backdrop for this effort, as it was happening, adopting a pretty pedestrian reworking of Phantom of the Opera.  Back-to-back shots of standing sets and clips from the movies they were featured in should've been more liberally used although I imagine it might've disrupted the story too much had they not limited it to the opening reel.  But the footage that does exist makes this a very special TV movie experience.  It was an inspired idea to film this.  Naturally, expect to see a bunch of well-known character actors.  Definitely good B-movie quality due to the setting.",1416873600,,746,5.024390243902439
8481842,3,B005OT81JY,Provided a grim but worthwhile look at the MGM backlot before the studio let it all slip away.  Included scenes of the actually destruction of some of the studios familiar backlot sites.,1397606400,,186,4.8125
8481843,3,B005OT81JY,"I chose a medium rating because the movie itself is pretty bad. However, the print is amazing and it's nice to be able to see some of the old MGM backlot footage so clearly.

I have fond memories of this made for TV movie from my youth.",1381968000,,236,4.0212765957446805
8481844,4,B005OT81JY,"As another reviewer has said this is not a great movie, but an interesting one for its revamping of the Phantom of the Opera story. When I saw this back in the 70's I enjoyed it but didn't realise it was actually the demolition of the MGM sets that was taking place, so I have given it a 4 star rating for its historic value, the film itself, and not least the casting of the sadly underrated and unappreciated talents of Jack Cassidy. Glad to see it has finally been released.",1372464000,,477,4.252747252747253
8481845,5,B005OT81JY,"1974 was right in the decade of Roller Disco, CHIP's & Battle of the Network Stars so this film was the light at the end of the tunnel. Jack Cassidy is marvelous as the Phantom. Yes, its a TV movie so it could never be a cinematic triumph, however the way the story plays out is very satisfying. I like the fact that people are missing in this lonely dilapidated back lot. They go in...they don't come out! Great atmospheric scenes with the Phantom too. One that comes to mind is when he buries those he has killed in the prop graveyard! Cut a slice of 70's horror and join the Phantom of Hollywood.",1361318400,2,599,4.2631578947368425
8481846,5,B005OT81JY,"If your penchant is for movie studio backlots (and how well you remember them,) this is for you! It was shot on the vast MGM lot just prior to it's demolition in 1974. The plot is self- evident, but the stars are the lots themselves. It makes a terrific companion to ""The Worlds Greatest Backlot"",released by Amazon late last year. JACK CASSIDY plays the title role and also Peter Lawford (who made many a musical there too) For this reason alone, For me, the movie is priceless. If I had seen the two young louts damaging the lot the way they did, I would have given the Phantom one hell of a hand.  Highly Recommended.",1351641600,,620,4.391304347826087
8481847,5,B005OT81JY,"If you're interested in a wonderful, close-up tour of the backlots of MGM, this is a great movie.  The story was the story, however, seeing old sets, and 1970s cars (which are now considered vintage...HA HA), was great.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in seeing behind the scenes at MGM.",1350000000,,308,4.7924528301886795
