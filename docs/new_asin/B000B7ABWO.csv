8590504,2,B000B7ABWO,"For those of us who enjoyed Boney M in the 70s', this DVD is worth buying purely for presenting a fairly good collection of their hit songs. However, the production of this DVD seems like a home project by some Korean guy who is smart to market & make some money on Amazon. ""DTS Surround"" is mentioned on the cover but the only audio available is in stereo. The songs are not in their respective order as per the label. While the DVD cover mentions ""Live"", many of the songs are studio recordings & some of the live material does not seem to sync with the singers'lip movements.

Be careful when you buy this.",1145232000,9,609,4.342105263157895
