2018598,5,B0001NBNIY,"What can you say about the greatest t.v. show of all time.  We get the last season of coach, before his untimely death.  Plus, the introduction of fraiser into the fun bunch of cheers.  If you watch it you'll be sure to love it!",1085443200,2,228,4.136363636363637
2018599,5,B0001NBNIY,"I luv Cheers! I have seasons 1 & 2 & can't wait to get season 3!! Cheers has the best cast/characters & they really take you to a place ""where everybody knows your name""!",1083974400,2,170,4.029411764705882
2018600,4,B0001NBNIY,"In Cheers' third season,there are 7 cast members. Kelsey Grammer has joined the cast as Dr. Frasier Crane,a psycologist who Diane Chambers(Shelley Long) is romantically involved with. Diane and Sam(Ted Danson) were no longer a couple,at least not at this time. At this time,Nicholas Colasanto who is Nick ""Coach"" Pantusso,became terminally ill and passed away in early 1985 at age 61. Grammer remained on the series thru its 1993 cancellation,thus being(his character) spun-off on Frasier. Frasier premiered immediately after the cancellation of Cheers and in fact,the spin-off itself has just been cancelled after 11 seasons. Grammer portrayed his character for 20 years! Way to go,Kelsey!!! That's eight years more than the late Carroll O'Connor's character Archie Bunker on CBS's All In The Family and Archie Bunker's Place.",1083715200,2,827,5.519685039370079
2018601,5,B0001NBNIY,i love cheers and im happy the third season got realsed but i think i would just be better if they had an interview with shelley long at the end... she was the best on the show ne way,1082851200,,183,3.717948717948718
2018602,5,B0001NBNIY,"They definitely need to release these at a quicker pace, i.e. Friends. They added a lot more interesting special features on Season 2 and hope they continue. I'd love to see more bloopers from each season.",1082160000,,205,4.722222222222222
2018603,5,B0001NBNIY,"Where are the other reviews I have written. This is like the 5th or 6th one I had to write. They are not being posted. Anyway, CHEERS is the greatest show of all time. And the 3rd season is great. CHEERS is truly a classic.",1079481600,,223,3.977777777777778
2018604,5,B0001NBNIY,"This is perhaps the best year of Cheers. This contains the first appearance of Frasier Crane, and the last year of Nicholas Colasanto (Coach). The writing in this year is the freshest, and the byplay between Sam, Diane, Frasier and Coach (whose conniving to get Sam and Diane together is fully realized here) is top notch. Cheers would not get better than the third year in its 11 - and this DVD will show why.",1079136000,,410,4.48
2018605,5,B0001NBNIY,thank the studio for releasing the 3rd season so fast after the 2nd one - i hope all the rest of the seasons come sooner,1078704000,4,120,3.84

2018674,5,B0001NBNIY,"I enjoyed going back and watching the Cheers series starting at the beginning. I thought that I had seen most of the episodes when this series aired on television, but I was mistaken. I realized that there were quite a few episodes that I missed, or completely forgot about. It is so enjoyable going back and getting reacquainted with the various characters of the Cheers gang. What great actors they were, as some still are. It's so refreshing being able to watch such great, clean humor when it is so difficult today to find such a sitcom. Never an episode goes by without a good, hard laugh every time Norm enters the bar!!",1483056000,,626,4.548672566371682

2018829,4,B0001NBNIY,In its time it was a great sit-com but the constant character of Ted Danson trying to conquer every woman gets a little old. The characters at the bar and the establishing the power of this show would catapulted some of these people into great futures is amazing.

I wish the characters played around a bit more and stepped out of their character shell. In season 4 Diane did an impression of Sam and it was hilarious. I really wish they gave her a more comical role. It showed she had a really goofy side that could have benefited the show.",1463788800,,450,4.244186046511628

2019125,5,B0001NBNIY,Great Show!,1448323200,,11,5.0
2019126,5,B0001NBNIY,Funny show. You can watch quality show's like this over and over. AND THE LAUGHTER IS REAL. It's filmed before a LIVE studio audience. Not like so many of today's shows that couldn't exist without a laugh track.,1448323200,,211,4.578947368421052
2019147,5,B0001NBNIY,"Other than the first half of Season 5, this is my least favorite season because it gives Sam and Diane so little opportunity to interact romantically since Diane is dating Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammar) and Sam is 'dating' most of the women of Boston. Sure, there are those who think the whole Sam and Diane storyline was a mere distraction from the more important matters of how many beers Norm could consume in one sitting, how many barbed insults Carla could lob, and how many 'little known facts' Cliff could come up with - but I'm one of those people who was there for their complex dynamic, not for the Greek chorus of barflies.

That said, the season is as high in quality as the others, and I still laughed my a** off a great deal of the time - I just missed the longing looks and passionate clinches of the best couple on TV. They do get in a few good moments - the one where Diane turns the tables and seduces Sam, only to pretend-cry out Frasier's name in revenge for him gloating so badly over her calling out his name while with Frasier - offers up one of Shelley Long's most convincing looks of utter adoration - and one of Ted Danson's most weak-kneed reactions to Diane finally giving him a little action.

The idea that the two would still choose to work together despite their history - or that Diane would be so sanguine watching her ex squire around every woman under 45 in the metropolitan area - is pretty absurd, but this IS  a sitcom so I will cut it some slack.

Sam and Diane fans might do well to skip around here - and then fast forward to the last episode, when Diane prepares to leave for Europe with Frasier, a buttoned-up sensitive man who is much better suited for her - but who just doesn't do it for her deep down. The goodbye scene where she and Sam can't stop hugging - the unbearable pain of letting go of someone you love but who just won't give you what you want - is the kind of emotionally-wrought but still funny scene that elevated this show to so much more than 99.9999% of sitcoms will ever achieve.

The two finally kiss passionately, but as usual, Sam won't give an inch. Diane understandably leaves for Europe with Frasier, but the two star-crossed lovers can't stay off the phone with each other. The season ends with Sam uncharacteristically getting out of the bar and doing something to show Diane he cares besides trying to bed her - he flies to Europe to try and stop the wedding (we'll ignore the fact that he hits on the plane's stewardess). Of course, these days, he would have just texted her.",1447891200,,2551,4.396186440677966

But, it also gave us a very humorous character in Frasier. Many classic episodes, including ""The Mail Goes to Jail"", ""The Heart is a Lonely Snipe Hunter"", ""The Bar Bet"", and too many others to mention. Woody Harrelson came in Season 4 and as great as he was, Coach was always a little missed. As far as the extras go on this dvd, a little disappointing. The bar tour was extremely disappointing. I thought it was gonna be the guy taking us around and showing us every nook and cranny.

2019491,5,B0001NBNIY,"Fully established as a sitcom powerhouse, the third season of Cheers would end in sadness. During filming, Nicholas Colasanto, who played the loveable Coach, discovered he was dying. Told he had only six months to live, he would pass away six weeks later, leaving a gaping hole in the cast. With three episodes left in the season, it was explained that Coach had gone on vacation. During it's orginal airtime, in the pre-title bumper joke of the final episode, an out-take of Colasanto was inserted as a farewell.

I do sympathize with reviews posted feeling the Featurette in memory of Coach should and could have been more extenstive.

For a character as beloved as Coach and an actor/director/producer so respected as Nicholas Colasanto, you'd think someone would honor him with more than a six minute blurb, most of time simply showing clips. Ted Danson and George Wendt talked briefly and emotionally about Colasanto, including the revelation to most that Colasanto directed a number of shows, including Columbo, Bonanza, Starsky and Hutch. Although I suppose the truest form of honor to his spirit is the fact that over 20 years later people are still enjoying his work.

However, the series continued to grow in the third season, with the addition of Dr. Frasier Crane as Diane's boy-friend / therapist. Kelsey Grammer's refined psychiatrist would become a major character in his own right, leading to the titular spin-off.  Talk about a perfect fit ... Frasier seemingly effortlessly fits into the cast. His voice of reasoning fell on deaf ears in this screwball ensemble.  The writing for his character through out the show is priceless.

Beginning with Sam drinking to excess again and ending with a wedding cliff-hanger, the third season is a notable year for the series, producing some of the best episodes in the show's entire 250 episode run.",1158537600,,1856,5.009740259740259

2019493,5,B0001NBNIY,"One of the greatest television comedies in history, Cheers is an absolute ""must see"" for anyone who's ever had a regular hangout ""where everybody knows your name"". The shows centers itself around the friendly neighborhood Boston bar named Cheers. The bar is owned by former Boston Red Sox relief pitcher Sam Malone (Ted Danson). Sam has three employees - bartender Ernie ""Coach"" Pantusso (Nicholas Colasanto) and waitresses Carla Tortelli (Rhea Pearlman) and Diane Chambers (Shelley Long). Season 3 witnesses the edition of popular cast member Kelsey Grammar as Dr. Frasier Crane (who would later spawn his own series spin-off, Frasier). Regular barflies Norm Peterson (George Wendt) and Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) round out a strong supporting cast.

The Cheers (Season 3) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes and begins the ascent of Dr. Frasier Crane, imminent psychologist, as a television icon. Notably, Dr. Crane's stint on Cheers was originally intended to last for only a few episodes until his character became a regular cast member (similar to John Ratzenberger's ascent on the show). Michael Richards (Kramer from the hit show Seinfeld) makes a notable guest appearance in episode # 62. Following her breakup with Sam and abandonment of Cheers, Diane returns to the bar at the request of Coach who feels it will help Sam end his problem drinking. The Sam-Diane-Frasier love triangle lasts for the entirety of the season, culminating in the final episode where Frasier proposes to Diane while the two are on a trip across the European continent...

2019494,5,B0001NBNIY,"The ""Cheers"" series needs no review for those who have seen it.

2019496,4,B0001NBNIY,"Cheers is one of the all-time great sitcoms in tv history and P

2019497,5,B0001NBNIY,"Another delightful addition to your collection, the complete 3rd season of ""Cheers."" As with previous installments, the features are a little skimpy; ""Virtual Vera,"" ""Shrink-Wrapped: Introducing Frasier Crane"" and ""Carla's Whipping Boy"" are themed groups of clips from the third season itself...thanks, but I'll just catch the amusing moments in the actual episodes. Why not some commentary from the actors on these subjects, instead? Or how about a look at the actual Vera, portrayed via voice by George Wendt's real-life wife.

""Cheers"" the DVD gives Nicholas Colasanto as skimpy a goodbye as ""Cheers"" the TV series gave to Coach Ernie Pantusso (who was written out of episodes with various flimsy excuses in the second half of the 3rd season and was finally written off the show completely at the beginning of the 4th with one sentence from Diane: ""I was so sorry to hear about Coach.""). In a wee little six minute segment, Ted Danson (who can't seem to keep his facts straight -- Nick died in February, not ""over the summer""), Rhea Perlman and George Wendt talk about what a wonderful, sweet man Nick was and the impact he had on their lives and the show. Ted says it best when he declares that Nick was ""all the sweetness in 'Cheers.'""

 (On a related note, the decline of Nick's health is evident in the show itself, as Coach loses weight and almost loses his voice, which make some of the episodes hard to watch, although Nick gave an Emmy-worthy performance until the very end.)

 Despite my little grumbles about the continuing lack of good extras, I still have to give this set five stars, as the quality of the show itself it just stellar. Shelley Long, the new addition of Kelsey Grammar and the rest of the cast are in top form, as always. Even after 20 years, ""Cheers"" remains a classic not to be missed.",1090454400,11,1818,4.722397476340694

I'm not sure how long, but it doesn't really matter.  Hopefully, we won't have to wait very long for the 4th season to come out on DVD.  I'd like to see Woody get in on the action.  I liked Coach, he was great.  He took everything too literally.
When the 1st season of ""Cheers"" was released on DVD in May of 2003, I was thrilled, I bought and watched it.  But then towards September I was beginning to think the second season was never going to get released.  Then in January (2004), it finally was, and I bought that, too.  Then in May, the 3rd season came out and I bought it the day it was released.

The season starts out with Cliff returning from his Florida vacation, and Diane has returned from a mental hospital in Connecticut. Sam has fallen off the wagon and is chasing skirts with little blood in his alcohol stream. With Coach's private urging, Diane works at Cheers again with Frasier's approval.
