6446577,5,B00KTOPI7M,"It took me a long time to decide to watch this show...and I'm soooo glad I did! This series just gets better and better with every season! Certainly, one of the highlights is Keith-Lee Castle's portrayal of ""Mr. Count"" Dracula.",1412812800,4,227,4.7
6446578,5,B00KTOPI7M,Better than the first season. The new characters definitely made the show more enjoyable. Loved the cousins.,1412121600,,108,5.411764705882353
6446579,5,B00KTOPI7M,I LIKE A GOOD FAMILY VAMPIE SHOW,1411689600,,32,3.7142857142857144
6446580,5,B00KTOPI7M,"This is SO excellent!  One of the best vampire series I've seen. It is great fun to watch. Although  I got REALLY tired of the ""you're only a girl"" thing being said twenty thousand times (ok, that's a slight exaggeration).",1409875200,2,222,4.525
6446581,4,B00KTOPI7M,"This says it's a children's drama, but I find it still too much for them.  There isn't any gore or hideous creatures, but there is the threat of it.  However, my husband and I enjoyed it.  It's the story of Count Dracula's son, from his perspective, and he doesn't want to bite people and is trying to stop the war between the vampire slayers and the vampires.  Evidently, girls have no status in vampiric culture, and his older sister is in competition with him to be the better vampire.  Lots of cute moments, and Count Dracula is timid when threatened, and isn't at all what you would expect.",1409011200,2,595,4.472222222222222
6446582,5,B00KTOPI7M,"love this show, great casting, funny. please make another season.",1408579200,,65,5.6

6446584,4,B00KTOPI7M,I have enjoyed watching this children's program to see young Dracula struggle to use his burgeoning powers and maintain his ethics. It is also an entertaining comedy.,1463961600,,166,5.185185185185185

6446594,5,B00KTOPI7M,Excellent comedy series!!!,1455580800,,26,8.0
6446595,5,B00KTOPI7M,"Ok so cheesy, yes but Renfield (Simon Ludders) very well done and reminded me of the old Young Ones series. Count Dracula  (Keith Lee Castle) was not only had the look but managed to pull off the slap stick humor the show was going for while keeping the forbodding and devilish charm that the Count should have. The real talent was in the character, Ingrid Dracula, the daughter played by Clare Thomas. I saw the show more of her characters transformation rather than Young Vladimir Dracula. Full of angst and lack of recognition she set out to become the pure evil a Dracula should be but in the end only wants her father's love. I watched every episode then watched the first season again just to put it all into perspective. Highly recommend for those that love dark humor.",1455580800,2,776,4.58273381294964

6446602,5,B00KTOPI7M,"A great  TV program , it's  funny, well written, and we'll done  on many  levels. The actors work well together, professional  in their  portrayal  of such unique  characters. America  could  never  do a program  like Young  Dracula  and keep  it  so light hearted",1449014400,,264,4.790697674418604

6446609,5,B00KTOPI7M,"LOVED IT!!!! It's kind of feels like the Addams Family or Munsters. It's a 'kid' show that is actually very progressive in some aspects. I like how the characters have depth and that there aren't just ""this guy BAD""... ""this guy GOOD"". The good guy can have flaws and the bad guy can have virtues. The show develops over the series and more elements are added. Definitely, worth watching if you want some cheesy fun.",1446422400,,416,4.56

6446613,5,B00KTOPI7M,"Great show. At First I thought I wouldn't like it, but after watching all of season 1 I am hooked. It's not too campy so as to make it only for children and it's not to scary  so  small children can enjoy it  without having nightmares. Another EXCELLENT British show.",1444262400,,267,4.3
6446614,4,B00KTOPI7M,Great for kids. Funny and suspenseful,1444176000,,37,5.333333333333333

6446630,3,B00KTOPI7M,A quirky Brit sitcom with an interesting premise. Have to give it some time for it to develop which it does pretty well by the end of season two. Then season three is where it starts to get pretty good and is worth the time spent on the earlier shows.,1432944000,,251,4.04
6446631,3,B00KTOPI7M,It is quite campy and over the top. Fun to watch.,1430956800,,49,3.5454545454545454

6446634,4,B00KTOPI7M,"Season 3 is becoming less farcical as the young actors grow older. It reminds me of the aging process in the Harry Potter series. The series became more somber and grim. The charm of pre-adolescent innocence gives way to the angst of the teenage years. It's life, of course. We can't escape the process. This show is still worth watching.",1428019200,,338,4.65

6446644,5,B00KTOPI7M,"Pleasantly surprised and that I loved the show from the very first pilot. Season 1&2 is semi comic American ""Munsters"" type of show. Truly a children's show because Vlad is a rebellious preteen. Then in season 3-5 Vlad is a rebellious teenager and things get very serious. No longer a children's show.",1419552000,2,301,4.8076923076923075
