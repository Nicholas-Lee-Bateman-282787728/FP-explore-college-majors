2194266,5,B0006SSST6,"Understandably nobody wants to ""claim Hitler"" as a part of their social construct or world view.  But facts are facts, and what's related here -- taken also together with the info in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hidden-Hitler/dp/0465043097/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hidden Hitler</a>, about which this documentary is focused -- is powerful evidence.  Not only evidence for ""der fuhrer's"" youthful romps with other men, his later vainglory in the ""men's world"" of the WW-I trench warfare, but later in the ""muscular homoerotocism"" of the Third Reich itself.  Not to mention his SA units who were led by the openly homosexual R&ouml;hm, and whose units were known to commit pedophilic rapes and drunken homosexual street parties which was costing ""der fuhrer"" some of his popular support.  Another work to consider is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pink-Swastika/dp/0964760932/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pink Swastika</a>&nbsp;which is hated by the gay movement, but also provides even more supporting detail.  Hitler condemns the Jews, capitalists, Bolsheveks, Americans, British, etc., in his ""Mein Kampf"", but says nothing about homosexuality.  Homosexuals later in the Third Reich were interned into the concentration camps -- but only the softer males.  The leather-clad S&M phallic-aggressive macho sexual predators who also inhabited the German homosexual scene rose to high positions in the Third Reich, and occupied roles in the machinery of death and destruction.  If I could fault this documentary, it is only that it spends too much time apologizing for the implications of Machtan's findings, for the facts of Hitler's and the Nazi movements homoerotic aspects.  There are plenty of interviews with leading homosexual scholars and gay-rights advocates, denouncing Machtan and his findings but without giving clarity about why (other than they don't want Hitler identified as homosexual), but not one interview with those who agree with Machtan.  One important question raised in the documentary, and which remains unanswered, is ""why out of over 100,000 books published about Hitler and the Third Reich is this aspect of his sexual life almost never mentioned?""",1197849600,,2275,6.08125
2194267,5,B0006SSST6,"This movie is absolutely hilarious. I don't understand how one can not see the explosive humor contained within this documentary. Now don't get me wrong, it is a well researched documentary and the evidence is quite convincing. However, the editing and directing of this film is pure comedy. From the rolling purple schwastika in the opening credits you will be laughing non stop. There are scenes of Hitler prancing, Hitler doing limp-wristed heils, nazis doing shirtless leapfrogs, and all other sorts of hilarious gayness. The funniest part of the dvd is when accounts of Hitler's homosexual activities are recounted in English (via voiceover) by people faking German accents. I'm really not sure if this film was made to be intentionally funny or not, but it is and you owe it to yourself and the millions who suffered at the hands of this worthless pile. Its good that we're questioning his sexuality. It decimates Hitler at the highest levels. Anyway, bravo.",1152403200,,964,5.03125
2194268,1,B0006SSST6,It's like arguing the point of the sexual orientation of staphylococcus aureus:  a digression from its primary import.  Likewise was Hitler's meatless and alcohol free diet.  To investigate the behavioral incidentals of a monster trivializes its monstrousness and can only make it appear not quite so monstrous.  Preventing the recurrence of such a monster is paramount and is not served by examining what was not so monstrous.,1127347200,,427,5.3283582089552235
2194269,4,B0006SSST6,"Of course, everything about Nazism and the Holocaust disgusts me and most people.  It took strength to rent anything that so much as says the word ""Hitler.""  Still, if this controversy could be used to halt gay rights, I had to see what was going on.

A straight, German professor, Dr. Machtan, wrote a book arguing that Hitler was gay.  This documentary looks at his evidence and speaks with individuals that take issue with these assertions.  This documentary was rather long.  I had to turn it off several times because I was so repulsed by seeing all those swastikas.  However, I did like the way the documentarians go through the argument bit by bit; they peeled the onion here.

This documentary begs the question of how can you prove any deceased, pre-Stonewall gay identity.  If Hitler loved male camaraderie and never attempted to have a successful relationship with any woman, does that make him gay?  He continually stated that Nazism was more important to him than romance and people keep forgetting that ""passionate friendships"" were common for those born in the 19th century.  Countless contemporaries called Hitler homosexual, but were they just hating on him?  Hitler liked art and opera, but isn't it stereotypical to jump to a conclusion from that?  Ernst Roehm, an openly gay Nazi leader, doesn't get mentioned until the end of the documentary, unlike ""Bent"" where he's brought up in the beginning.  This issue of how ""straight"" leaders deal with their gay peers was not stressed here, though it's fascinating.  This segment reminded me of what people have said about Dr. King and Bayard Rustin or John Lennon and Brian Epstein.

Unfortunately, Dr. Machtan's opponents are not strong debaters.  One guy says Hitler could not have prostituted himself because he always had a scowl on his face.  Some men, especially pre-Stonewall, like the idea of ""rough trade.""  Another said Hitler could not have had a sexual relationship with Roehm because ""Roehm was unattractive.""  Power and fame make men attractive.  The famed, late muralist Diego Rivera has constantly been called ugly, but he was a notorious and successful womanizer.  Why should Roehm be different just because he was gay?  I do critique the documentarians because they never ask the question if Dr. Machtan is just trying to get paid, completely ignoring how his ""conclusions"" could affect gays' rights.  I wonder if they let him off the hook so often because he volunteered so much time for the documentary.

The documentarians briefly mention J. Edgar Hoover.  However, I wish they would have mentioned that a debate about Abraham Lincoln's gayness is raging on this side of the Atlantic as much as one is about Hitler on that side.  They never ask, ""Why is it that bad figures in history are easily believed to be gay but good figures are challenged constantly?""  Besides Abe, note how people are adamant in refusing to think that Jane Austen or Malcolm X could have been lesbian or gay, respectively.

Some American gay studies scholars and gay rights activists are interviewed here.  However, their scenes are so small, they might as well have not been included.  Many of the mid- and early 20th-century quotes here are read with campy German accents.  Who did the creators choose for readings:  Dieter, Hans und Franz, or Uter the foreign exchange student?

Of course, I hope that Hitler was not gay.  Still, I think this documentary was a good exercise in thinking about deceased leaders and their sexual acts and identities.",1110585600,,3512,4.955479452054795
8042871,3,B0006SSST6,"I give the video a 3 star rating because even though the program is lacking in production value, but the information given provides some good starting points for additional research.

I suspected Hitler's homosexuality ever since I read in William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich that Hitler used the familiar du pronoun only with Ernst Roehm.

8042875,5,B0006SSST6,"My father-in-Law is now deceased. He was a member of an SS military unit.  Everyone in the SS knew about Hitler's sexual proclivities.  His personal SS guards would talk; especially when drinking.  When Germany annexed Austria, the Gestapo (with the SS) decended on every police station in Vienna in their search for written documents pertaining to Hitler's activities as a homosexual whore while in his 20s.",1337040000,,408,5.151515151515151
8042876,2,B0006SSST6,"In 2001 Lothar Machtan published the book THE HIDDEN HITLER, which put forth the notion that Hitler was a not-always-so-closeted homosexual whose attempts to cover up and then deny his homosexuality played a significant role in the direction of the Nazi party. The book sparked considerable controversy among historians, some of them accusing Machtan of sloppy research, but all of them sounding the same bell: where is the proof? The documentary THE HIDDEN HITLER continues the debate, with Machtan attempting to raise the notion of Hitler's homosexuality above the level of speculation.

The fundamental difficulty in examining Hitler's sexuality is that no specific documentation survives. There is simply no hard and fast proof that Hitler ever had sexual relations with anyone. We do know that as young man he had several very intense friendships with other young men. We do know he had an intense relationship with his niece, who died under mysterious circumstances. We do know that Eva Braun was typically thought of his mistress. But no one ever came forward to say ""I had sex with him."" There is no real documentation of any kind, and as such it is utterly impossible to know.

Filmed in 2004, THE HIDDEN HITLER is essentially a riff on Machtan's book, but it is not nearly as speculative as the book was; in this film, many scholars challenge Machtan's notions, and what ultimately emerges is a series of unproven possibilities. The strongest argument for Hitler's homosexuality, or bisexuality, is the accusation that he molested a member of the Wagner family, but again there is no factual proof, no tangible proof, no written statements or records or photographs. So ... was he or wasn't he?

Perhaps the most interesting question raised doesn't pertain to Hitler's sexuality but to how we perceive it. Certainly the gay community would be horrified if hard proof came to light; no one wants to claim Hitler. Certainly neo-Nazis would be equally displeased. On the other hand, certain groups who despise both homosexuals and neo-Nazis would welcome the news and attempt to discredit homosexuals by linking them to neo-Nazis and the like.

THE HIDDEN FUHRER is an interesting documentary, but it is also one that needs to be taken with a shaker of salt. For at the end of the day, and regardless of what anybody says, we simply don't have any proof one way or another. Hitler may have been homosexual, bisexual, heterosexual, or asexual for all we know, and unless unexpected evidence suddenly comes to light, we're never likely to know for sure.

In fact, it almost seemed as if the film was being filmed to refute the author.  The 'scholars' though did not seem to be genuine.  I think they would refute the charges even if their were a museum filled with pictures of Hitler in the act.  One argument given that Hitler was not gay was that he was not good looking enough.  I thought he was nice looking in pictures of him as a younger man.  I do not know what that would have to do with it anyway.  Senator Barney Frank is nothing to look at.  I was not convinced either way after seeing this film and think I will delve into this subject further by buying the book, Pink Swastika.",1295740800,,762,4.2727272727272725
8042879,1,B0006SSST6,"""Understandably nobody wants to 'claim Hitler' as a part of their social construct or world view. But facts are facts.""

Yes, facts are facts. Here are a few:

1. Homosexuality is not a mental disorder. Credible researchers, beginning with Dr. Hooker (the first to avoid using a polluted sample of men with a history of treatment for mental illness) in the 1950s, came to that conclusion which belatedly became consensus of the legitimate mental health community of experts in 1973. I say belatedly because the anti-gay animus of many members of the APA interfered with their ability to rationally. Indeed, one of the top experts that Hooker sent her folders to for independent review was so certain, prior to reviewing her work, that homosexuality was a mental illness that he went through the data evaluation process twice -- before concluding that he was utterly wrong. He could find no difference between the two groups of men in terms of mental adjustment.

As a result of this fact, any rational person will understand that all forms of heterosexist discrimination are irrational. The only refuge for such attitudes lie in the realm of religion.

As neither homosexuality or heterosexuality are mental disorders, the sexuality of Hitler is a matter best described with one word: trivial. To attempt to argue that Nazism is a manifestation of homosexuality, something born due to homosexuality, is to attempt to argue that homosexuality is a mental illness. Facts are facts, eh?

2. Amateurish interpretations of totalitarian imagery and themes may lend, superficially, to the belief that homosexuality and Nazism are interlinked. Bogus Youtube videos about Hitler's fictitious homosexuality, for instance, often show photos of highly masculine imagery and the like -- failing to comprehend the true meaning behind such images. Those images are not mere sexual fetishism, they are the representation of patriarchal heterosexual male dominance -- in the form of the state. They are symbolic, and interpretations that argue that the chief attribute of totalitarian imagery (including that which uses masculine bodies) is homosexual sexual taste are utterly preposterous. One of the reasons, indeed, that homosexuality was deemed incompatible with the Nazi state, both in terms of the populace and in terms of the military -- and purges occurred -- is due to the mistaken belief that homosexuality in men is akin to effeminacy. There is also the issue of the subversion of the patriarchal statist social structure by the presence of gay men; their existence questions the rigid code of Nazi totalitarianism in which women were expected to be highly fertile and men were expected to be extremely powerful. This is patriarchal ""family values"" heterosexuality taken to an extreme. You will see strong men and fertile women over and over again in utopian heterosexual imagery. The ghoulish mechanized ultra-masculine bodies of totalitarian imagery are merely the totalitarian version of such fantasy -- in which the state, rather than a religion, is depicted as the actor -- and upstanding male citizens are supposed to not only bow to such power, but strive to become part of it through such things as military service.

Such totalitarian heterosexuality is the antithesis of typical homosexual utopian concepts. Furthermore, the stereotypical quips about ""Hitler's limp wrist"" and so forth, that also accompany these pseudo-historical pseudo-academic musings (in order to explain the brutal systematic oppression of Germany's homosexuals) contradict the faulty central claim that the Nazi leaders represent a highly masculine ""S&M"" variety of homosexual male, a variety that systematically eliminated effeminate homosexuals for whatever reason.

3. Nazism was one of history's most clear-cut examples of a social philosophy that was opposed to homosexuality. The temporary involvement of a token number of homosexuals in the movement (I saw temporary as there is something called the Night of the Long Knives, for instance) does not change this fact -- a fact that is established by the entirety of the history of the movement. This is a history in which homosexuals were first castrated or jailed for being gay, Paragraph 175 of the code was modified to contain even more anti-gay animus, and homosexuals were eventually rounded up and thrown into concentration camps, camps in which they were often segregated from other inmates and were treated to such things as being dunked with buckets of cold water outdoors in cold weather and pseudo-scientific medical experimentation.

4. The history that has been ignored is not the mythical homosexuality of Nazism, it has been the plight of gay men. Germany, post Nazism, did not recognize gay Holocaust survivors. They received no restitution, the small number who survived the particularly brutal treatment. In recent times, some Jewish groups have held protests over the opening of Holocaust museums. Whatever for, one immediately asks. They protested the inclusion of gay survivors' stories. This is the reality of our day, and the past in question. It is a reality in which mainstream politicians routinely defy reality by positing that gay citizens aren't fully human (don't deserve the right to have their marriages recognized, don't deserve the right to adopt, and so forth). Nazism was not an isolated example of anti-gay animus. Heterosexism and homophobia are easy to find today, world-wide. Texts that try to engage in some of the most preposterous victim-blaming in history, such as those that argue that Nazism is due to homosexuality, are more of the same.

Even if we were to believe in this fantasy about Germany's past and the role of homosexuals in it, there is no scientific evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a disorder. None. That means that homosexuality itself has no bearing on the mental state of the people in question in the past or present. Instead, all that we're left with is the idea that cultural conditions (heterosexism/homophobia) alone motivated a number of homosexuals to form and execute Nazism. So, even going out on the most fantastical of limbs (that a highly vulnerable brutally victimized minority is really the victimizer in disguise) -- we're left with the impossibility that homosexuality, the sexual orientation itself, is relevant beyond being a cautionary tale as to why it's a bad idea to treat gay people badly!

Homosexuality does not influence mental adjustment. The only thing that is relevant at all is anti-gay animus. So, even if one believes in such pseudo-history, one must blame anti-gay animus for the behavior of those involved! That conclusion, unfortunately, like the truth of the history, completely undermines the demagogic purpose of such literature.",1293840000,,6771,5.290232558139535
8042880,5,B0006SSST6,"Hitler Homosex Spin Out

  The Homosex Roots of the Nazi Party and its Leadership have been known since its earliest days, although still one of the least studied or remarked upon aspects of these hate driven perverts. The so called 'mainstream' media have studiously ignored these facts for decades, if only because the Truth is so Ungood that it might cause the 'Vanilla' (clueless voters / taxpayers) to question the entire Radical Homosex agenda being pushed by said media.

  Thus the release of a documentary [""The Hidden Fuhrer - Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality"" - Strand Releasing 2004] based on the outstanding book by German Author Lothar Machtan {""The Hidden Hitler"" - Basic Books 2001} offers a rare and insightful look in to the Core Value of Nazism and its Leaders  - Homo-Anal Perversions and Ephebophilia (Rape of adolescent Boys), albeit with a slightly different spin than Machtan's book.

  As was clearly shown in by Authors Lively and Abrams in their important work (""The Pink Swastika"") - the Nazi Party was founded by the butch wing of Homo-Anal Perverts active in Germany during the decline of the post WW-1 Weimar Republic. Its real founder was the Notorious Boy Raping former leader of the ""Freikorps"" (a paramilitary gang) named ERNST RHM, who as leader of the Jackbooted Brown Shirt Homosex Thugs of the ""Sturm Abteilung"" (Storm Troopers) was instrumental in the rise of his Homosexual Protg / Boy Toy - Adolf Hitler.

  The documentary ""The Hidden Fuhrer"" follows up on Machtan's book and features interviews with Machtan and others, including prominent German Homosex Activist / Apologists, and also includes archival footage that many may not have seen, or ever had explained to them. For example, the frequently shown clip of Nazis 'Burning Books"" is presented and explained for what it truly was - the Destruction of incriminating and embarrassing Medical / Psychiatric Records detailing the various Sick Perversions that were common to the Nazi Leadership at the time.

  However, an added bonus to this documentary is the inclusion of what were probably intended as 'serious' rebuttal from German and other Homosexual propagandists, such as Machtan's former teacher Rudiger Lautman, which becomes so Orwellian in its attempted Doublethink as to actually be humorous. For example, although Rohm and Hitler were both Notorious Homo-Anal Perverts with a long and intimate relationship, Lautman would have us believe that they were not sex partners / buggery buddies because: ""Rohm was rather unattractive.""

  As anyone who has ever seen pictures of the Sado Masochistic Homo-Anal Bondage and Buggery festival known as the Frisco 'Folsom Street Fair' can certainly attest, the standards of 'beauty' amongst this crowd are not shared by many outside the cult. Rohm was indeed a battle scarred piggish brute of a man, but this is just peachy keen to Hitler's type of pervert, and Hitler showed himself to be every bit as bent as any of his subordinates.

  In fact, it was only when Rohm became a rival to Hitler and threatened to expose him as a Coprophile Pervert of the rankest sort, that it became necessary to eliminate him and other knowing allies in what was referred to as: ""The Night of the Long Knives"" (also the title of an insightful History Channel Documentary). It should be noted that the first (of the few thousand) Homosex Inmates of the Concentration Camps were mostly Storm Troopers still loyal to Rohm after the execution - although most were let loose and allowed to join the army later on.

  For the rest - the documentary does a good job of paralleling Machtan's book, and although many homosex radicals attack his work, none are able to make a dent in his presentation. It also does a good job of distinguishing between the Butch and Fairy (what one old German Pouf called the ""Yoo Hoo"" boys) camps of the Homosex cult, and how only those homosexuals who were considered a danger to Hitler were targeted by the Reich, while those who cooperated were rewarded just like the rest.

""The Hidden Fuhrer"" is an outstanding accompaniment to Machtan's outstanding work, and when read in conjunction with the ""Pink Swastika"" actually provides a historically accurate, if massively politically incorrect, understanding of the Homosex Perverts who made the Nazi Hate Machine the nightmare it was.",1199318400,,4351,5.0418994413407825
