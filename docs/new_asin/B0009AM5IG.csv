8059017,5,B0009AM5IG,"This production of L'Elisir d'Amore turned out to be everything I had hoped for and more...The talent of and the chemistry between Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna does justice to the beautiful score written by Donizetti.
  The scenery and costumes as well as the supporting cast provided a wonderful finishing touch to a truely enjoyable experience.
  Finally, the sound and video reproduction proved to be more than adequate and the highlights CD is icing on the cake.",1298246400,3,473,5.103896103896104
8059018,5,B0009AM5IG,"Alagna & Gheorghiu are uttlerly charming, delightful and beautiful in this performance.  The supporting cast rose equally to the occasion and their respective roles.",1200787200,4,165,5.875
8059019,5,B0009AM5IG,"Although the superstar couple Alagna and Gheorghiu are the leads in this opera, it is Alagna who really is the star in this live opera. Alagna displays his fabulous voice and comedic ability. He really makes his lovesick character to be believable and funny. Gheorghiu is in fine voice here too, but somehow her acting ability seems to be more strongly suited to drama (she was superb in ""La Traviata""). Her performance seems forced. She's still a fantastic beauty with a voice like an angel. I think her overbite is just cute. The performance was well filmed as visual and sound are excellent. The rest of the cast are in spectacular form.",1175990400,3,640,4.723214285714286
8059020,5,B0009AM5IG,"I have two other Elixir DVDs (Pavrotti twice, paired once with Kathleen Battle and once with Judith Blegen).  They're all good, but this is my favorite.  Alagna and Gheorghiu can both act as well as sing, and they work well together (they are, after all, married).  When Angela tells Dr. Dulcamara that she doesn't need his elixir, the close camera work makes the reason as clear as her complexion.  Dark eyes, long dark hair, and a voice that never fails-- this Romanian beauty is another reason to cheer the collapse of communism.",1168300800,10,532,4.75
