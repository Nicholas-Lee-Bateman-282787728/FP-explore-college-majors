Shawn Lantz is a beautiful writer and speaker, and she has a way of presenting this difficult subject of forgiveness in a digestable and engaging manner. You will want to watch each video as soon as the previous session ends, and you'll find the tie-ins between the videos and Bible study workbooks really fantastic. I highly recommend this product to any individual, small group, or church group interested in exploring what the Bible says about forgiveness.",1379894400,,541,5.022222222222222
7795377,5,099000211X,My church women's group did the Forgiveness study in Jan 2013.  It was great.  I highly recommend it.  It helped me to reconcile with a valuable friend.  Shawn Lantz is a great speaker & teacher.  She is very down to earth.  Her life experiences are quite amazing.  The dvd's and workbook work well together.  We will definitely use her other bible studies.,1379808000,,357,4.645161290322581
