3841182,5,B0021R4ID0,"Secret Saturdays is a brilliant, well written animated series that ended way too early. Fiskerton is my favorite. I like the story line with the creepy T.V. show host as the bad guy - and there are a lot of plot twists that make it ""more than a kids' cartoon."" As for the vendor- I'm not sure what I'm reviewing here - my item arrive in perfect condition and in timely manner - it was great. But, back to the Secret Saturday - I miss it - and now I can watch the dvd to my heart's content.",1398038400,,489,4.0

3841185,4,B0021R4ID0,"I love secret Saturdays.it is one of my favorite shows ever.its funny,action packed,and well played out.but I would suggest highly buying it on iTunes because the first season on iTunes is both DVDs plus three episodes for like $5.00 more.if you don't use apple then go on and buy the DVDs but I suggest buying it from iTunes.",1357084800,,326,4.637931034482759
3841186,4,B0021R4ID0,"Great start for the series  Since the series has been removed for the Cartoon Network schedule, there needs to be more episodes to rival other series like Jonny Quest.",1271116800,,167,4.758620689655173
3841187,4,B0021R4ID0,"This cartoon can be used as a change of pace from your average run of the mill special effects cartoon. The parents are scientists dedicated in protecting a special species. It reminds me a little of the Herculoids cartoon. The dastardly V.V. Argost is perfectly type casted black magic spells and all. This is an alternative cartoon, highly entertaining and well recommended for children and adults.",1258070400,,400,5.075757575757576
3841188,4,B0021R4ID0,"""The Secret Saturdays"" is an action-packed series where a fearless family - Doc, Drew, and their son Zak - scour the world for mysterious treasures and tracking down the elusive Cryptids.  What are Cryptids you ask ?  Cryptids are freaky-looking creatures like Zak's buddies Fiskerton, a 7-foot gorilla-cat monster and Komodo, a giant lizard that can turn itself invisible.  These creatures must be protected from the villainous V. V. Argost, host of ""Weird World"", who plans to use the Cryptids for his own purposes.  With the Saturday family around, it's never an ordinary day for them.

The DVD has 5 episodes starting with the 2-part opener ""The Kur Stone"", the one artifact that is in need of guarding.  Other episodes include ""Vengeance of Hibagon"", where the family travels to Tokyo in search of a Bigfoot-like creature.  Super-cool special features include a gallery of drawings, deleted scenes, and a Cryptid catalog of all the creatures that the Saturdays encountered so far.

So this is a rather impressive new show from Cartoon Network.  Look for Volume 2 coming this October and see new episodes on TV and new stories every month in ""Cartoon Network Action Pack"" comics.",1250726400,,1183,5.0256410256410255
3841189,5,B0021R4ID0,"I've been a huge fan of ""The Secret Saturdays"" ever since I saw it premiere last year on October 3rd, 2008! The basic plot of the show is that, the Secret Saturdays (Zak, Doc, and Drew, along with their cryptid pets, Fiskerton (a Fiskerton Phantom, a seven foot tall gorilla-cat), Komodo (a genetically modified Komodo Dragon that can turn invisible and that has a huge appetite), and Zon (a Pterosaur-like living dinosaur that they rescue in the second half of the pilot episode, that is the only female cryptid pet of theirs, and carries Zak through the air in some later episodes), are Secret Scientists that help protect cryptids (the mythological animals studied in cryptozoology that are, so far, undiscovered in science, such as Bigfoot, the Yeti, the Loch Ness Monster, etc.) from being revealed to the public/media and from being harmed by villains, such as, V.V. Argost, my favorite character/villain in the series, his assistant/servant, Munya (who can transform into a half-human, half-giant spider monster), and many other villains. The main storyline is that, the Secret Saturdays, along with a bunch of other Secret Scientists, find an artifact called the Kur Stone, eleven years before the events of the pilot episode, which is supposed to release Kur, the most powerful cryptid, which will give the person that follows the clues on the Kur Stone and releases Kur, a huge, invincible, insanely powerful cryptid army, which would allow the person to become insanely powerful and rule the world, so in pretty much every episode, the Secret Saturdays have to fight against V.V. Argost and Munya, because Argost wants to unleash Kur and rule the world. Also, each Secret Saturday character has a special ability: Doc is able to use a Battle Glove to fight against enemies with, Drew is able to use a Fire Sword to fight against enemies with, Zak has a gift with cryptids, which lets him bond with and control the cryptids, so he can sometimes stop cryptids from attacking his family, etc., Fiskerton has superstrength and can climb very well, and he has another special ability that is revealed in a much later episode, Komodo can turn invisible and can eat a lot of things, and Zon can fly.

The five episodes on this DVD are:

 1. The Kur Stone: Part One (first half of pilot episode)
 2. The Kur Stone: Part Two (second half of pilot episode)
 3. The Vengeance of Hibagon
 4. The Ice Caverns of Ellef Ringnes
 5. Guess Who's Going to be Dinner?

There are also some special features, such as animatics/drawings of some of the episodes, some deleted scenes from those episodes, and a cryptid catalog (pictures of and information about some of the cryptids encountered in the first five episodes of the show.) There's supposed to be a second DVD of this show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-Saturdays-Vol-2/dp/B002G1WPJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret Saturdays, Vol. 2</a>&nbsp;coming out on October 27th of this year, so hopefully, ""Cartoon Network"" will release even more DVDs of this show and maybe a few boxsets of it, too, in the near future. I love and own this DVD and I can't wait to get the next one and anymore of them released in the future!",1249603200,3,3227,5.0299625468164795
3841190,2,B0021R4ID0,"I happen to like this show a lot.  However doing the math, 22min per episode x 5 episodes = 110 min. This volume is over priced.  5 episodes is too few for 13.49.  I hope this series will eventually air in Season Box Sets.  Until then, I would suggest recording the series as it airs old and new episodes on TV.",1240790400,5,311,4.049180327868853

8349387,4,B0021R4ID0,"My son really loves this show.
A lot of today's cartoons are missing the mark when it comes to pleasing their target audience: KIDS.
So many are trying to be cool with adults or too silly for the wee, little babies out there that there aren't enough good AND fun  shows to watch for the middle-aged kids {10 and up}. Too many 1 or 2 season-ers then just when you felt comfy and get into your show and start looking forward to new shows and more seasons-BAM !!, its cancelled.
We miss Young Justice, Avatar, Jonny Quest from the '60's,this show and others like it aannd. Secret Saturdays.",1399766400,,587,4.435185185185185
