3165458,5,B001700732,"Outstanding movie! The raid on Tokyo seen in a completely different perspective, and how it changed the life of one of the bomber crews. If you are a Christian, you need to see this movie, and share it with everyone you know!",1368921600,,225,4.380952380952381
3165459,4,B001700732,A great DVD!  Great to know how that God was able to change a mans life for His cause.  Would love to see a move made about it but I guess this documantary will work.,1358553600,2,166,3.7142857142857144
3165460,4,B001700732,"I'll presume that most who read this already know who Jake DeShazer is, if you don't, I recommend Googling his name.  He was a remarkable man...war hero, but even more astounding is the love God gave him for his enemies...the same enemies who tortured him in prison.

The DVD is very good, gives a good life history of Jake, when he was born and how he grew up.  It tells about his mission (from the mouths of those who were there), of his incarceration as a prisoner-of-war, and an account of the years that he spent in prison.  It then goes over his life-changing experience and subsequent ministry to the people of Japan.

The DVD is good, but I didn't give it five stars because of several things.

1) the initial title menu is a bit confusing...they just say ""program 1, program 2"" etc.  For the DVD they could have combined it all (it's not that long) or named the titles appropriately.

2) there is very little information about his recent history.  He passed away in 2008 or so, but really the story leaves off in the 1950s or so...not much mention past that.

It is still a very good DVD and I'll still be keeping it and showing his story to others, but those two items are what keep it from being a 5 star for me.",1300838400,3,1223,4.324561403508772
3165461,5,B001700732,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this documentary.  I wasn't expecting it to be poorly done, or I'd not have wanted it, but I didn't expect it to have such in-depth information and such a variety of interviews!  It takes you through Jake DeShazer's life as Doolittle Raider in WW2, as prisoner of war to the Japanese and Christian convert, and as missionary.  A really neat part of the story is that a pamphlet by him about forgiving his enemies led Mitsuo Fuchida, who ran the aerial attack on Pearl Harbor, to Christ.  Certainly worth your time and your money!  You'll also find, when reading about Fuchida elsewhere, that his plane barely held together from the Pearl Harbor attack, as he found out when he got back to Japan; that he almost died at Midway from the Americans bombing his ship; that he was in Hiroshima the day before the atomic bomb fell on it; and that he alone was unscathed among the search party that returned to Hiroshima the day AFTER it was destroyed.  Surely he attributed these later on to the providence of God!",1295568000,10,1052,4.569148936170213
3165462,5,B001700732,"The DVD is a compelling story of an airman who participated in one of the greatest top secret military operations in U.S. history. But I believe he would rather be most remembered by what he achieved after the war, spreading the good news of God's forgiveness and love to a shattered Japanese country.",1293926400,8,301,4.69811320754717

8264296,5,B001700732,This DVD is one that every one should view whether churched or unchurched.  It certainly reveals the true definition of forgiveness.  I believe it would be a good DVD for a high school U.S. History class because it is part of U.S History.,1446681600,,238,4.511627906976744
8264297,5,B001700732,A great faith based film around the famous Doolittle raid.  Contains a lot of actual footage of group complete with interviews of the last survivors of the 80 men that trained and  completed the first bombing of Japan by the United States during the 2nd world war.,1436140800,,264,4.595744680851064
8264298,5,B001700732,"Excellent documentary and recording of memories while they are/were still around to record! It teams well with ""Tora, Tora, Tora!"" which gives an entirely different picture of and focus on those WW2 happenings.",1435881600,,210,5.393939393939394

8264301,5,B001700732,"You won't be disappointed with this DVD if you like Missionary Biographies like me.

It chronicles his life and shows how terrible the Japanese prison camps were and why we fought so desperately to rescue people from them.

More importantly it shows how the Word of God can change lives so dramatically. Jake goes from intense hatred to intense love and goes back to give his life to tell the good news of Jesus Christ to a nation of spiritually hungry people blinded and brainwashed in all the perils of Emperor worship.",1389312000,2,521,4.6521739130434785
8264302,5,B001700732,This is great!  A true story not only regarding forgiveness but ultimately a reminder of our need to know our Holy God! Please buy this DVD- one for you and one for a friend or family member.,1380672000,,191,4.162162162162162
8264303,2,B001700732,"The middle section of this DVD didn't play.  It kept freezing up as if it had been scratched.  I enjoyed the other two sections, but the documentary style of the presentation did not hold my middle school class's attention as I had hoped.",1371081600,,238,4.511627906976744
8264304,4,B001700732,I was intrigued by this story from the first time I heard about it on a radio broadcast. The documentary moves a little slow but the story carries the message well.,1369180800,,164,4.32258064516129
