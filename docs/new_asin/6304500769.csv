891946,5,6304500769,"I love the original Christmas Carol movie (1938 version with Reginald Owen) and you can see that this adaptation borrows heavily from it--the room furnishings even look similar in some cases.  Since my kid isn't quite old enough to watch the original and appreciate it (and sit still!) this was the next best thing.
It's the wonderful story told where kids can relate.
Little one sat and watched entire thing without complaint and that says a lot!!",1513123200,,448,4.818181818181818

891948,3,6304500769,"Call me Scrooge. But Disney has never developed a Christmas special that has heart. They always leave me cold. Rankin Bass did a much better job of Christmas with specials like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, and The Year Without a Santa Claus. The only Disney movie that succeeds is The Nightmare Before Christmas. Mickey is cute but that isn't enough.",1510358400,,373,4.84375
891949,5,6304500769,What a classic! A little steep on the price @ 10$ but well worth it in the long run. If my son rewatches it as much as I did as a kid it will pay for itself. He's still a little young but we've already got a few viewings in.,1491350400,,224,3.5

892254,5,6304500769,"Got this for my toddler to watch when he requests ""Mickey Mouse on the TV."" I'd never seen it before, but I was fairly impressed. It's only a half hour long, but fits in the entire Christmas Carol plot without feeling rushed. In addition, there are 5 classic winter-themed Disney shorts, all of which are quite good. Between the main program and the shorts the entire package extends out to over an hour, so I feel like I got my money's worth. My boy enjoys it quite a bit, and we'll probably be firing it up for many Christmases to come.",1483056000,,538,4.336633663366337

892436,4,6304500769,"I love Mickey's Christmas Carol! Always have, always will. But the reason I didn't give it five stars is because of this yodeling cartoon that is added as one of the shorts. I was expecting all of the shorts that had been aired in the TV version when I originally saw it. Instead, the first short is the yodeling thing that I refuse to watch. The cartoon that had Donald Duck having a snowball fight with his nephews (which I love!) is not included at all. I'm just glad two of the others (the one about Pluto's favorite Christmas with Chip and Dale, and the one where Goofy learns to ski) are included in this version.",1482537600,,619,4.344827586206897

I have been wanting to watch this again for years due to this being a favorite of mine when I was a kid and it would play on the TV around Christmas time.  Loved watching the Christmas Carol cartoon.  The following short cartoons though were a big disappointment.  I was hoping they would be the same ones that played when I was little but the only one that I remember was Pluto's Christmas tree.  Oh well, cannot complain too much because I purchased at a good price and I finally got to watch A Christmas Carol once again.",1482451200,,660,4.333333333333333

Backgrounds are different, sounds are different, this version is even zoomed in a tad from the original. I've heard disney does this often and I don't like it. One noticeable difference is when Scrooge is locking up for the night and it first pans to the clock tower. In the original, the clock is chiming throughout the whole scene. In this version they cut the clock chime out entirely. I wish they would release an original 1983 version.",1480636800,,522,4.684782608695652

894620,5,6304500769,"Loving Dickens' Christmas classic as much as I do, I am surprised to find myself enjoying this short take on it as much as I do.  It's probably because I love Mickey and Disney so much.

They have kept the important parts of the story the same.  Scrooge (Scrooge McDuck) is a miserable miser who hates Christmas and over works Bob Cratchit (Mickey Mouse).  But one Christmas Eve, he is visited by his dead parter Jacob Marley (Goofy) who warns him about three more spirits.  Can visits from the Ghosts of Christmas Past (Jiminy Cricket), Present (Willie the Giant), and Future (Pete) help him see the need for compassion?

Since this ""short"" is just under half an hour, they quite obviously truncated the story.  But they hit the most important parts, allowing our emotions to truly be moved.  I'll admit, I get chocked up at the end.  The animation is wonderful in a way only hand drawn animation can be.  While some of the casting is a bit odd (Goofy as Marley?) most of it works.  And it is fun spotting all the characters who have blink and you miss them cameos.

About the only serious issue with the film is the ending.  Marley and the Ghost of Christmas Future can be frightening.  By making Goofy Marley, they make him out to be funny.  However, they go overboard at the end in what could be a truly frightening moment for young kids.  You will probably want to keep that in mind before letting them watch it.

Obviously, this VHS copy is long of out print, but the movie has made several appearances on DVD.  If you love Disney and Dickens, you'll want to find a copy to enjoy year after year.",1259971200,,1602,4.446735395189004

894623,4,6304500769,"""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" is a retelling of Charles Dickens' classic ""A Christmas Carol"" in animation with familiar Disney cartoon characters in all the roles.

Scrooge McDuck leads as Ebenezer Scrooge, greedy London businessman and miser, with Mickey Mouse as his underpaid and underappreciated clerk Bob Crachit and Donald Duck as Scrooge's nephew Fred.  Goofy is Jacob Marley, Scrooge's dead partner, come to warn Scrooge on Christmas Eve of the terrible fate awaiting him in the afterlife if he does not reform his ways.  As in Dickens' novel, Scrooge is visted by the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, and learns his lesson.

This is family entertainment with a lesson.  In just 25 minutes, Disney has managed to capture the essentials of the story, hopefully without exceeding anyone's attention span.  The ghostly tale is told with humorous relief, as Goofy's Jacob Marley is accident-prone and various other characters make pratfalls.  One wishes Disney could have stretched out the animated story a little longer.

This short movie is highly recommended as a great introduction for children young and old to a classic Christmas tale.",1197072000,,1156,5.278688524590164
894743,1,6304500769,"That's exactly what I said to my Mom when I was very young and I saw it. I still have nightmares.

Call me the second coming of Scrooge if you will, but even if I am the only one, I hate this movie. It's all good ol' fashioned Disney fun, then comes the Ghost of Christmas Future. That whole scene with falling into the grave, in my humble opinion, is Michael Eisner child abuse. Not only does Disney have to add the whole dramatics of the scene where Mickey goes to Tiny Tim's grave--they feel an insane compulsion to add as much drama as they can to stretch the loopholes of the G-rating. Oh, yeah, and Scrooge gets right in the audience's face at the last second. Masterful cinematography, I'll admit. Having a talking Scottish duck thrown at me has never been so scary, but hey, they managed to do it. Perhaps it would have found a better home in nightmare on elm street, but with Scrooge McDuck? I didn't think so.

Now, see, in Dickens, Scrooge is crying at the feet of the G.o. C.Y.T.C., and not screaming for the safety of his eternal soul. I always thought that the ghost should have been the sorcerer from the sorcerer's apprentice. For one thing, he stays silent. For another, if the scene were altered for Dickens accuracy, it would be dramatic and not just a kid's nightmare. The whole scene with Crachit visiting the grave was good. Had they stayed on that note and not added any material borrowed from Dante, I would have been pleased.

As I said, the movie is good otherwise. In fact, I would personally go and see it if they completely re-did the Christmas Future scene to be like I said. But for old man Disney, it's -so- important to be dramatic, even if it means scarring little kids for life.

Long live Muppet Christmas Carol. Now there's a Christmas Carol for you.",1190073600,,1787,4.439024390243903

894745,5,6304500769,"This animated short-film was released in 1983. Two years later, I'm a newborn baby in diapers. For the last 20 years of my life, I have loved this cartoon like you wouldn't believe. This has been one of my all-time Favorite Christmas films of all-time.

Disney takes his own characters and puts them into the roles of Charles Dickens' classic, ""A Christmas Carol"". Scrooge McDuff playes the cranky and evil Ebinezer Scrooge. Bob Cratchet (played by Mickey Mouse) is his overworked, underpaid employee. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by the spirit of Jacob Marley (played by Goofy). Marley was just like Scrooge seven years ago and as punishment, Marley is forced to walk around with heavy chains. He then informs Scrooge of three visits from three spirits.

The first spirit, The Ghost of Christmas Past (played by Jiminy Cricket), appears. He shows Scrooge of his past and how he became so greedy and evil. The second spirit, The Ghost Of Christmas Present (played by Willie The Giant) shows how poor Bob Cratchet and is family are. Bob has three children, but his youngest son, Tiny Tim, is very ill. The final spirit, The Ghost Of Christmas Yet To Come (played by Pete) shows Scrooge of Tim's possible death, which can cause the possible devestation of Bob Cratchet. Scrooge is then shown his own grave, where he wakes up a changed Duck.

He heads over to Cratchet's house. On the way, he promises his nephew, Fred (played by Donald Duck), that he will be at his Christmas Dinner Party. Scrooge buys a load of toys and makes it to Cratchet's house, where he proposes his offer to Bob of making him his partner, as well as giving him a gigantic raise in pay. He hands the toys to Bob's children, where all three Children, including the adorable little Tiny Time, climb onto Scrooge's lap, where Scrooge hugs them so passionately.

This is the cutest Christmas movie for all kids, including adults (for the children inside of us). Everytime I watch this, I watch it with a smile on my face. I do shed some tears for the scene of Tiny Tim's possible death, but this movie is very enjoyable for all, children and adults.",1133136000,4,2125,4.67379679144385
894746,5,6304500769,"This 1983 Disney adaptation of Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" has animals playing the parts of characters. However, it doesn't pander down to its audiences. This makes it a family film which the whole family can enjoy.

Ebenezer Scrooge (Scrooge McDuck) is a miserable and greedy old miser. His sole employee Bob Crachit (Mickey Mouse) has a large workload but receives meager sums. Scrooge expects Bob's family to do his laundry for him. Bob was even expected to work on Christmas Day if he did not want to be docked pay.

Scrooge continues his assaults on people until he receives a visit from the ghost of his partner Jacob Marley (Goofy). He was like Scrooge while alive and now has to do penance for that behavior. Three spirits visit Scrooge to offer him the all-critical one last chance.

The Ghost of Christmas Future (Pete----a little-used Disney character) is by far the scariest of the apparitions. After seeing that Tiny Tim Crachit (Morty Fieldmouse) will die in the future present, Scrooge is then pushed into his own coffin by this spirit.

He wakes up in a panic on Christmas morning, tangled in his bed sheets. The reformed Scrooge showers the Crachit family with presents and elevates Bob to partner of the counting house. This very big promotion will enable Tiny Tim to receive the very best medical care then available and Scrooge himself becomes an uncle to the kids.

I love the animation, but I also love the music to this film. I really do get a warm feeling inside me whenever I hear ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" being played. It captures the sentiment of this film and the holiday season in general.

I'm concerned that this fine film is bundled into a compilation DVD series as opposed to having its own release. It certainly deserves a single release.",1129852800,6,1776,4.787581699346405

894748,4,6304500769,"A Christmas Carol has to be one of the most often-filmed stories so its only natural that Diseney would try its hand at this classic.

This was an enjoyable little Disney film.  It's not the top of their game in terms on animation but it captures a decent spirit of Dickens even with the usual Disney cast of characters.  Pete is particularly scary as the Ghost of Christmas future.  And Alan Young's Scrooge is over the top.

If there's one complaint its that the less than 30 minute run-time really doesn't have time to do the story justice and it all seems a bit hastily thrown together and so much of a great story is lost in the translation.

It's a pure joy.... moving, gives hope, inspiration and makes you believe again...in the magic of Christmas.",1069545600,9,917,5.1610738255033555
894864,4,6304500769,"The only real complaint about ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" is that it only runs 25 minutes, which means the story gets a bit rushed.  The rest, such as the idea that Goofy should play Marley, is just quibbling (Goofy has the height to make it work).  On the plus side of the ledger is the on-point casting of Uncle Scrooge McDuck as Ebenezer, Mickey Mouse as Bob Crachit, and Jiminy Cricket as the Ghost of Christmas Past.  Historically ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" was important for Disney because it was the first animated Mickey Mouse short in thirty years.  Since these are the Disney characters inhabiting the familiar roles from ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens, you end up with a winning combination of goofy humor and warm sentiments.  However, you cannot help but thinking that given the creativity of Disney, even in those dark days six years before ""The Little Mermaid"" brought back the magic, this could have been a pretty good feature length animated film.  Compared to other Disney animated shorts, ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" is a five.  But compared to other versions of ""A Christmas Carol,"" this one is just short of the top tier.  Worth having?  Absolutely.  But just make sure it is not the first version of this Christmas classic that the small fry see.  They should appreciate the original holiday lesson taught by Dickens before they enjoy this more comic version.",1069200000,8,1387,4.909871244635193

894868,5,6304500769,"""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" is a wonderful adaptation of the Charles Dickens' Classic Christmas Story as only Disney can do!!
Children especially can follow the basic storyline with ease, and, the musical score adds the necessary elements to make this a truly heart-warmimg Christmas Classic.",1009497600,5,291,5.636363636363637
894869,5,6304500769,"One of the best Disney films to date.
It follows the Dicken's Classic fairly well.
I do recomend it to any disney fan.
But Please Dont Watch this Film if you are Dull, crabby, no fun, have no sense of humor, or are just plain A** Holes!.  It's a Movie, it isn't real and it wasn't trying to hurt Charles Dicken's Classic Story,  Every Film has to be rewritten in some way to adapt.",1006819200,,381,4.135135135135135

894942,5,6304500769,"This definitely is a Must See Disney Classic. It tells you the great story of a Christmas carol and at the same time the Disney's character's personalities fit the character that they are playing. It is especially great for children who would be bored hearing the story while the movie keeps them entertained by bringing in Disney characters.
I definitely recommend this movie, but I would also tell you to read the book, because it is also a real classic.",976924800,3,456,4.7125
894943,3,6304500769,"Well, if you are planning to skip the book ""A Christmas Carol,""  and just see the video to do your paper, or take a test, I don't suggest you use this version. I would sooner use ""The Muppets' Christmas Carol,"" or even ""The Flintstones Christmas Carol"" to teach someone the story. But aside from that, it is not bad. The animation of Victorian England is well done. The Disney characters (especially Goofy as Jacob Marley) add some cute comical touches. I do not feel I would make time for this, but if you have 30 minutes to kill between Christmas duties, this is a fine way to spend it.",973987200,,588,4.394495412844036
