8064297,5,B0009OL91G,"Girl From Rio has lots of action, suspense, drama and even a few musical numbers that make it one of the better films from Monogram released by Alpha Video. The plot moves along at a very good pace; and the acting for the most part is convincing. The cinematography is about average for what was probably a low budget film; but the choreography impresses me a lot. The casting was also well done. The quality of the print could be better in some places; but these old movies from Alpha Video are rarely restored properly and so we get what we get.

When the action starts, we quickly meet successful young Brazilian singer Marquita Romero (Movita) who is about to have her big opening night in a club. Unfortunately, she gets a rather unexpected telegram from a mysterious woman in New York where her brother Carlos (Alan Baldwin) has been living; the cable tells Marquita that her brother's been arrested and that she must come at once to New York. Marquita's boyfriend Steven Ward (Warren Hull) thinks Marquita may want to stay at least for her opening performance but Marquita rushes to New York to try to help her brother.

When Marquita arrives in New York she goes to the hotel where she meets Annette Templeton (Pamela Blake), the woman who sent the telegram--and it turns out that she's Marquita's sister-in-law! Carlos and Annette married a few months prior but they didn't want to lose their jobs at Mitchell's (Clay Clement) nightclub because Mitchell didn't want a married dancing act. They kept their marriage a secret even from Marquita! Now Carlos is in jail being framed for arson and murder; it seems that the only night Mitchell allowed Carlos to pick up his things from Mitchell's old club was the very night the club had a terrible fire and was destroyed--and an employee lost his life in the fire. All Carlos can afford is a public defender who doesn't believe his story and it's up to Marquita and Annette to do whatever they can to get Carlos out of prison and free again.

At about this time Marquita's boyfriend Steven comes to New York; and he gets a new lawyer for Carlos named Roger Montgomery (Richard Tucker); and Roger rarely if ever loses cases. Marquita and Steven also consult with Mitchell's insurance agent Dennis Slater (Lee Phelps). They hatch a plan to plant Marquita in Mitchell's new Condor Club as a singer so that she can spy on Mitchell and get proof that Mitchell started the fire in his former club himself. Then Carlos can walk away a free man.

After a bit of trickery and finagling, Marquita does indeed get a job as a singer at The Condor Club; but this doesn't sit well with Mitchell's girlfriend Vicki (Kay Linaker). Vicki is jealous of Marquita, to say the least; and she goes after Marquita in a big way.

The plot can go anywhere from here. Will Marquita be able to find the evidence they need to pin the crime on Mitchell himself and free Carlos? Will Vicki be able to expose Marquita as a spy? What about Mitchell's stamp collection--how does that fit into all this? Will there be another fire in the new club to make Dennis Slater pay out again? Watch and find out!

Overall, Girl From Rio is one movie I actually enjoyed from Alpha Video. This is a good crime melodrama with lots more to it and they pack everything into a neat 61 minutes so that you'll never feel bored! I recommend this film for people who like this genre of film and people who like classic movies may want to get this one, too.",1242518400,2,3457,4.5587761674718195
8064298,3,B0009OL91G,"Produced by poverty row studio Monogram in 1939, THE GIRL FROM RIO stars the lovely Movita Castaneda in a brisk crime drama about a Brazilian singing star who must clear the name of her younger brother.

On the eve of her major singing debut in Rio, Marquita Romero (Movita) gets a shocking telegram, informing her that her brother Carlos (Alan Baldwin) has been falsely-arrested on murder and arson charges.  Marquita packs her bags and heads for New York where she meets Carlos' young wife Annette (Pamela Blake).  With the aid of her boyfriend Steven (Warren Hull), Marquita infiltrates the inner-circle of 'Mitch' Mitchell (Clay Clement), the nightclub owner who laid the charges against Carlos.  Somehow, Marquita and Steve must discover the dirty little secrets which will incriminate Mitch and clear Carlos' name...

THE GIRL FROM RIO is standard fare from the Monogram studio, and the 61 minute running time will ensure it never stays beyond it's welcome.  Movita (best-remembered for her role in the MGM classic ""Mutiny on the Bounty"") is a gorgeous heroine.  Kay Linaker also has a fun role as Vicki, the jealous girl singer who eventually blows Marquita's cover.  Fans of late 1930s crime thrillers will no doubt get a big kick out of this one.

Alpha's DVD comes from a video master which appears to have been culled from an early television broadcast print (omitting the Monogram logo).  The picture is a little fuzzy but the soundtrack is clear and well-heard for the most part.",1215216000,2,1492,4.955823293172691
8064299,3,B0009OL91G,"Alpha Video, DVD distributors of generally unloved and long out of print American films, principally from the 1930s and 1940s, is rendering valuable service to those cineastes who value these works, since many of these productions will probably not be otherwise accessible and are thereby on their way to being collectible items.  Many of these are from prints proffered by private collectors, with Alpha selecting the best available copies, as there is no attempt toward re-mastering, and no DVD extras are provided other than scene selection, and some trailers, although the company's packaging is attractive and its liner notes are, for the most part, useful.  This film's principal attraction is Movita Castaneda, talented Mexican coloratura who favourably impressed United States audiences with her efforts in such as FLYING DOWN TO RIO and MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, later gaining additional renown when she, while pregnant, married (a much younger than her) Marlon Brando.  She is quite effective, both musically and dramatically, in this movie, noteworthy because few retakes are to be had under the aegis of lowly-budgeted Monogram Pictures, and while there are several scenes marked by brief skips, the largest portion of the print is free of these flaws and a viewer is rewarded by a briskly paced and interesting tale.  Movita is cast as Marquita Romero (""La Marquita""), an aspiring singer in Rio de Janeiro who, directly preceding a stage performance, receives a cablegram providing her with an unpleasant surprise: her brother Carlos is under arrest for murder in New York City.  Marquita immediately flies there, leaving behind her swain Steve (Warren Hull), and meeting with Annette (Adele Pearce), the young woman who had sent her the message and who is the new wife of Carlos.  Annette explains to Marquita that her husband is victim of a frame-up.  Naturally, Steve has followed Marquita to New York where he joins the women, the trio then engaging the services of a prominent criminal attorney, and it soon develops that a night club owner is the probable murderer, not Carlos, in an insurance related case where he may have destroyed his own business through an act of arson.  Marquita applies for a job to sing at the club as means of discovering the truth in this matter, and is hired by the suspect, all very melodramatic to be sure, yet the plot just about comes off thanks to some able acting by a competent cast of supporting players.  The film is burdened with a somewhat cluttered narrative line but Pearce, in addition to Dennis Moore and Kay Linaker as associates of the tale's villain, bring clarity to those sequences within which they appear.  Movita sings three numbers and veteran director Lambert Hillyer, thoroughly accustomed to working with thin budgets, abruptly ends the piece when time and funding run dry.  It must be noted that the language of Brazil and Brazilians is Portuguese rather than Spanish as is used here but, nonetheless, there is a good deal of enjoyment to be found in this admittedly routine production.",1147046400,6,3058,5.0476190476190474
