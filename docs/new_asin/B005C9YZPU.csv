8464967,3,B005C9YZPU,"The Truth About Angels, a suspense drama written and directed by Lichelli Lazar-Lea, is a Prism Awards nominee and won Best Feature at the Milan International Film Festival.  The story is about Pablo (Antonio Del Prete, Mission Impossible 3), a struggling husband, father and artist feeling trapped or maybe overwhelmed with the demands of marriage and parenting. His wife (Monique Gabriela Curnen, The Dark Knight) argues that they both made a choice to start a family thus both should equally shoulder the family responsibilities. Nevertheless, Pablo takes a time out from the pressures of life by going on a boys-night-out excursion. His best pal, Kane (Simon Rex, Scary Movie 3), a rising Hollywood star, picks him up in a stretch limo and then on to scoop up Ben G (Michael Azria, Looney Tunes), Kane's sidekick.  Pablo and Kane promise not to cheat on their wives as they enter a party mansion tucked away in the winding hills of California. Everyone in the party is young, fabulous and under the influence. Groupies, junkies, wannabes, and the star-struck keep the party interesting.  When Pablo orders a drink and begins to ask too many questions, the bartender sharply indicates that the party staff have all signed NDAs (Nondisclosure/Confidentiality Agreements) so mum's the word to any of Pablo's inquiries.

Pablo is captivated by Kristi (Dree Hemingway, Gucci model and great granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway), who appears innocent and out of place and at some point gets totally wasted.  Kristi is so wasted that she passes out. Ben G is conveniently available to take Kristi to a bathroom and rape her.  Pablo's sixth sense or fatherly instincts tells him that Kristi is in trouble but when he finds Ben G, it's too late. Pablo punches Ben G in the face but Ben G rattles back that Kristi is a MySpace slut and is only seventeen.  While Kristi is unconscious, Pablo tries to do the honorable thing by taking off his jacket and covering her body. Pablo finds Kane and mentions he wants to take Kristi in the limo to the hospital. Whoa horsie! Kane wants no part in the valiant rescue. Kane goes into self-preservation mode and declares to Pablo that his acting career would be jeopardized for being associated with a party that went sour.  Kane also reminds Pablo that Pablo's fingerprints are over Kristi's body, that Pablo was the last to be seen with Kristi, and Pablo's wife would not understand any noble explanation.  There is an unsettling end to cover up Kristi's death. Pablo returns to his modest life but is shocked by the recent chain of events. The Truth About Angels is edgy and brutally candid about human indulgence.  Although anything goes in the party world, Lichelli Lazar-Lea subtly brings out the indifference and numbness towards human life when inhibitions are far gone.  The entire cast showed promising acting abilities thereby lending the film to be provocative and alluring.",1336780800,,2917,4.956967213114754

This is one of those movies you will either love or hate. When we first meet Pablo we see a dad coming home from work and excited to see his baby. The sink is full of dishes, a tired mom is trying to feed a tired baby and she is unhappy. She asks Pablo to run a bath for the baby, he asks ""can I just catch my breath?"" Mom explains she has been up since 6:00 am and needs a break too and heads off to run the bath herself. Pablo receives a call from his oldest friend Kane and heads out in a limo for the night. He is excited about the prospect of an exciting evening and leaves his tired wife at home.

In Kane's exciting world, we see drugs, sex, money, beautiful woman, etc. Pablo runs into a mysterious woman named Kristi, Dree Hemingway who entices him to follow her. He does.  Suddenly he is in poppa mode taking care of her when she becomes unconscious. We don't know if she is drunk or has been drugged but he settles her and heads out to get help.

We see her unconscious body being raped (disturbing) by a Kane's sidekick Ben G. Pablo punches Ben and Ben tells him she came here for this. Once again Pablo is taking care of her. She falls out of the tub and hits her head and is bleeding. When he explains to Kane that they need to find an ambulance Kane explains that they can't call because it will hurt his career and end Pablo's marriage. Pablo is torn and eventually is forced to leave. The end of the party is as disturbing as it gets and we see how society is so dumb to the fact that we are all people and what is right and wrong.

The life that Pablo thought was so bad suddenly seems quite the opposite and we are left to watch Pablo cry over his sleeping daughter. Did Pablo need to see such derelict behavior to appreciate what he had? Are people really so desensitized that they could simply step over the body of a girl and go on with their lives without ever thinking about it again?

The movie was shot in 13 nights which is rather impressive and the acting is quite good. The religious undertones of the movie are there and I enjoyed the Greek names sprinkled throughout the party.

I found the movie even more interesting when I heard that the director and the actor who plays Pablo are married and wrote the movie after their daughter was born and worried about raising her in Los Angeles and the Entertainment world.

Pablo's cleansing at the end when he finally understands the harsh realities his daughter will have to face in this world made me want to cry for his rebirth!",1318723200,,2533,4.212371134020619
