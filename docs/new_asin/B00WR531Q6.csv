8713971,2,B00WR531Q6,"I purchased this quite awhile ago.  I just got around to watching a movie on it:  Fortress.  The movie was Pan & Scan (disappointed) and as it plays, there are small jerks through out the movie that happen ever second.  This leads me to believe that this movie was made from a PAL version of the movie (as that is what my other PAL movies do).

After seeing this, I played the 2nd movie on the same side as fortress.  And it jerked exactly the same!!

So, is this set really a Region 1 collection???",1468713600,2,499,4.189473684210526

8713973,5,B00WR531Q6,"This is a review of a 12 film action pack from echo bridge home entertainment. Design: 2 1/2 out of 5 stars. This movie pack contains 3 DVD's, all stacked on top of each other. There are 4 movies per disc, 1 disc is double sided with 2 movies on each side. A compact way to store them, but not a good way to store them for long term use. Movies: 4.5/5 stars. For a 12 movie pack, especially coming from echo bridge, you have to expect this kind of packaging. This means quality reductions, no subtitles and bad chapter selections. However, none of these affected my viewing experience. 8 of the movies on this set, in my personal opinion, were good: Cypher, Equilibrium, Imposter, Fortress, Nirvana, Renaissance: Paris 2054, The Faculty and The Prophecy. 1 movie was average, which was Phantoms. 2 Movies were bad, and I will describe each. 2012 Supernova is an average Asylum disaster flick. If you don't know who The Asylum is, think Sharknado. Heard of it or watched it for laughs? That movie was made by The Asylum. So was this one. A movie so bad, it's good because of laughs. I usually don't laugh at bad movies, but there have been worse movies than this. Apocalypse... If you are expecting it to be like the front box art... You'll be disappointed. 1 movie on this set is actually 2 tv episodes of a tv show called Total Recall 2070, just made into the form of a movie, Total Recall 2070: Machine Dreams. Technically, this is not a movie, however, I enjoyed it anyways. I paid $5.50 for this set, so at $0.55 a movie, I definitely got my money's worth. The quality of the movies are bad, averaging 2 to 3 mbps bitrate per movie, expect for 2: Renaissance: Paris 2054 and The Faculty. Renaissance was mixed (Could be because of the animation style used) and The Faculty was like a normal DVD release. The quality will not matter if you play these movies on an older TV, or on a portable DVD player. I finished the last movie last night, and decided to check the movie's chapters... On the 2 single sided discs, the chapter intervals are around 10 minutes each. It's like this... There's no specific area in the movie it skips to... Chapter 2 is at 10 minutes in. Cuts to the middle of a scene. On the double sided disc however, chapters are normal. Keep that in mind if you pause movies often. Subtitles are not present in any language on this set. Another problem I experienced was with the movie, The Prophecy. On my Playstation 3, the movie would not play properly. The movie is in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, but it plays like it is a full screen movie, making the view-able space really small. On my sony BDPS1200 blu ray player, it played like it should. Same with my Proscan DVD Player, even though it sucks at playing the discs. Looking for what movies are on what discs? The first disc has the more horror/thriller/Sci-fi type movies, The Faculty, Phantoms, Cypher and Nirvana. The second disc has the movies 2012 Supernova, Apocalypse, The Prophecy and Imposter. The 3rd disc is the double sided disc, containing Fortress and Total Recall 2070: Machine dreams, while the other side has Renaissance: Paris 2054 and Equilibrium. Pictures of the set itself and the problems I experienced are in the review. Overall: 5/5 stars. If you are looking for new Miramax titles to watch on DVD, and don't care about quality, subtitles or lack of chapter selection in 8 of the 12 movies, you'll be as happy as I am with this set. If you plan on buying this to watch The Prophecy on a Playstation 3, you will probably want to buy it elsewhere. Thanks for reading this review, and I hope this review determines whether or not to purchase this item.",1457308800,11,3645,4.507552870090635

8713975,4,B00WR531Q6,"there are a couple of good movies in this set that I would not pay a high price for on their own, so it was worth the price getting all 12. just be aware that you get what you pay for as far as the quality.",1454630400,2,206,3.5

8713977,5,B00WR531Q6,"Usually when I buy a multi movie action pack, I'll temper my expectations, knowing the majority on the pack will probably be movies that are lacking in story and action, but with the 12 Film Action Pack from Millennium Entertainment, I'm surprised at the quality of films and the stars included that this set contains. While not every film is a hit in my book, many of the 12 movies I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish.
THE ICEMAN-
Stars Michael Shannon, the guy who plays General Zod in Man of Steel, in a Mafia drama that would fit well with the story telling of a classic like Donnie Brasco. With a list of stars including Captain America's Chris Evans (as Mr. Freezy, a freelance Mercenary), Ray Liotta (of Goodfellas), Winona Rider (Edward Scissorhands), James Franco (Annapolis) and more, each giving great performances in this story about a cold hearted Hitman. With a soft side for his family, with great story telling that resolves most loose ends in a compelling way. 9/10
DIRECT ACTION:
Dolph Lundgren (Universal Soldier) gives a solid performance in Direct Action, where he plays a street cop who's determined to do what is right against a team of corrupt Unit cops, even after being threatened repeatedly at the cost of his life. Cool martial arts, great storytelling abound with a classic 80's style of directing. 9/10
STOLEN:
In one of his best performances in recent years (which says a lot for Cage, who sometimes dials in dull performances), Nicholas Cage (Con Air) returns to hero action form, on a quest to save his kidnapped daughter after a partner from a past robbery coerces him to pay up or else. 8/10
THE CONTRACT:
Morgan Freeman (Batman Begins) leads a team of assassins on a secret mission when everything goes wrong and he ends up a prisoner of the law, only to escape and be held captive by John Cusack (2012) and his son, who were on a camping trip turned upside down as the assassins target them to save their crooked boss. 8/10
WAKE OF DEATH:
In an emotional performance by Van Damme (Hard Target), he's a club bouncer turned vigilante on his enraged quest to avenge his murdered wife from a ruthless Japanese Crime Boss who has zero compassion for women as he kills them without mercy as he hunts for his runaway daughter. Van Damme teams up with his three hard edged friends, only to go it alone in the end in an effort to save his kidnapped son. 8/10
BLITZ:
Jason Statham (The Transporter) playing a hard nosed cop, returns in an interestingly paced thriller, tracking down a ruthless cop killer dirtbag on the loose who finds ways to twist the laws so he gets off the hook each time only to kill again. Statham doesn't get to use much martial arts sadly, but does beat up and shoot the bad guys with force. 7/10
RAMPART:
In an interesting story of a low life cop who ruthlessly bends the rules always in his favor, even with his broken family, Woody Harrelson (2012) fights the law in his quest to rid the city of crime. The question is, does his brutal approach pay off in the end, or put him into deeper turmoil with the city against his tactics against criminals? Star cast with Ned Beatty, Ben Foster, Anne Heche, Ice Cube, Sig Weaver, etc. 6/10
TRESPASS:
Nick Cage (The Rock film) returns as a businessman husband of Nicole Kidman (Eyes Wide Shut) and foolishly opens the door for the wrong people, now at their mercy in a half baked robbery attempt. This is one of those films where you think ""That was a dumb decision"" one too many times. Most of the film takes place in their house. Decent performances hampered by a silly script with questionable criminals. This would have worked better as a comedy than a serious crime thriller.  4/10
WAR INC:
Comedy about corruption as John Cusack and the lovely Marisa Tomei (The Wrestler, My Cousin Vinny) team up to take down the system. 5/10
AVENGING ANGELO:
Stallone (Rambo) sets out to protect a woman who is being hunted by hitmen. Nothing all that exciting for Stallone here sadly. Plays more like a comedy than an action movie, since there's hardly any action and the tone is light hearted.  5/10
CYBORG SOLDIER: In the style of Universal Soldier only not as interesting or exciting. Bruce Greenwood stars. 4/10
DESERT SAINTS: Kiefer Sutherland is a half hazard hitman without a heart, who kills any newly attained female partner who might bumble up his schemes of assassination. But is he smart to accept the help of a new female stranger looking for a cut of the pay? 5/10
While there are some duds, the winners in this affordable collection are movies you'd expect to see sold separately and of AAA quality in most respects. Do not pass up this collection.",1437350400,16,4657,4.629987908101572
