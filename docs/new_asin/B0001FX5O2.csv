8011913,5,B0001FX5O2,"I had to get the VHS to that show to make it Authentic. same picture and sound of the 1970's, because, I feel the digitalization destroys some of it.
Anyway - here's Bob's New hotel. and not only everything  goes wrong, but it gets fixed before it gets even more w rong. Starting With the door's hinges up to the windows on 2nd floor. Bob Newhard is considered one of the best comedians and People! He's in his mid 80's and STILL IS one of the great comedians. Look his videos. I have gotten one of his Lp's from the early 60's and it still funny now. But the show won't be good without the other actors. You have to give the pilot episode a shot and do not think 70's comedy has not so funny. For me - the modern humour is trashy full of jokes about perverts, lack of respect to people, too much about sex and really a REAL comedy is about variations of topics. Bob  is NOT putting down People in order to make a joke. Seinfeld is in the same League...Bob is an old School and some new comedians could learn from him.
The show is great for the good actors/actresses of it who ""aids"" bob maintain the hotel. I have seen part of the first pilot episode and am going to see it throguh. the other episodes I have seen in the past are great too. Just give it a shot! I was born in 1973 and I watch a show of old comedy and laugh at it. You might too!",1432944000,,1346,4.037453183520599
8011914,4,B0001FX5O2,This is a wild crazy bunch of Actors. They work well together and they are very funny. I am going to order the entire Series.,1360281600,,125,4.04
8011915,1,B0001FX5O2,I was disappointed that there were only 2 episodes on this video. I thought it would include more of the first season.,1294617600,,118,4.409090909090909
8011916,5,B0001FX5O2,"Bob Newhart at the Inn with Larry, Darryl and Darryll is always funny and entertaining. My whole family loves this show. I highly recommend this tape to any one who loves to laugh.",1217721600,,180,4.484848484848484
8011917,5,B0001FX5O2,"C'mon, studio!  Time for Newhart to be put on DVD!  At least the Bob Newhart Show (1st season) is coming out, but what's taking them so long?  And I love Newhart (Bob as Dick) even more than the BNS (Bob as Bob).  There's an amazing amount of other stuff out there (Too Close for Comfort? Three's Company? Puh-leez!) but not Newhart?  Newhart was sitcom TV at its best, the sort of clever and riotous wrtiing and acting that is gone now with the retirement of Frasier.  There's a huge market out there!  Maybe the studio should read Dick Loudon's book: How To Put a Great Show on DVD.  Now!",1113782400,17,590,4.348623853211009
8011918,5,B0001FX5O2,"Jack Dodson, famous as the mild-mannered city clerk Howard Sprague on Andy Griffith's show and Mayberry RFD, sells the Stratford Inn to the Loudons. the show was shot on videotape and not film in the beginning, and you'll spot this right away as the show looks clear and shiny. in this episode we're introduced to neighbor Kirk Devane, who turns out to be a self-admitted pathological liar which is even more hilarious because he might be lying about THAT! but, Kirk and Leslie were the younger set while Dick and Joanna tried to get the Stratford up and running. Joanna, as she's bragging on Dick's ""how-to"" book success, realator Jack Dodson tries to sell the couple on the Inn but indirectly insults Dick's career by saying: ""well, if you can't write in Vermont, you can't write!"". George Utley {Tom Poston} comes into the picture and his history of the Inn is explored. a funny first episode where all the droll, sophisticated, and at times eccentric humor of the 1982-1990 hit are layed out for the first time. the next episode deals with the couple learning that a dead woman is buried in their basement. George says something like: ""oh, Mrs. Newton? gee, it's not that bad. sometimes when i'm down there i don't even realize i'm walking on her"" to which Joanna looks as if she's about to throw up on her sweater. Dick and Joanna travel to Reverend Miller's church and inquire about Newton. she turns out to be a witch. Miller has a funny line after they ask how she died. Miller, acting fatherly, says: ""come now, they didn't burn witches in the 1700s"" and there's a slight pause and he says: ""they hung her!"". Newton was accused of making a woman's hair fall out and turning someone into a badger. later, after an unsuccessful run in with a typical yuppie teenager at the Inn who shown up to get the body {not knowing she was in the basement and had been dead for at least a century}, he freaks out and says ""hey, what is this? the Addams Family?"" and just at that moment the cast involved (Dick, Joanna, Kirk, and Leslie) look at him strange and Joanna starts to walk toward him and he runs off! the classic line by Dick: ""somebody needs to turn that kid into a badger!"" as the kid speeds off in his car. earlier the kid had said that because he now ""has wheels"" he's going over to England! Dick, very dryly says: ""that's...that'll be some trip!"". anyway, Kirk suggests that Dick hire some people who'll do anything for a buck. Their card reads: ""we'll do anything for a buck"". then, a few minutes later in walks Larry, Darryl, and Darryl as three woodsmen who'll do anything for a buck. Larry announces that Darryl had a rough time when he was crawling under a house. Dick says: ""that must've been a tough job"" and Larry says: ""it wasn't a job, Darryl here just likes to crawl under houses!"". as the trio are in the basement, excited over their witch digging job, Dick and Joanna decide to leave Newton buried in the basement. Here's the classic scene that explains why the three characters were so hilarious: Dick yells down in the basement for them to come back up. Dick asks how things are going and Larry, the only one who talks, says that they hadn't started digging yet due to the fact that they were flipping coins to see who got the first dig! When the Loudons announce that they've changed their mind, the woodsmen bow their heads and look sad that their moment of fun has ended. as they make their exit, Joanna yells: ""well, there was this rat..."" and Larry says: ""we'll take it!!"" and off they go in happiness over their job and that is the true essence of this show. absurdity and wacky people came and went but yet some people who feel the need to have reality in their shows, even in a comedy, will certainly be put off by this low-brow laugh riot. this show was hilarious but it's often viewed as inferior when compared to Newhart's earlier, 1972-1978, show. i like both programs equally but i'll have a fondness for this '80s show because that was what was on TV when i was growing up...every Monday at 9pm on CBS for a good number of years. this video is just a sample of how great the show was. highly recommended viewing with very little thinking required.",1079740800,16,4185,4.50065703022339
