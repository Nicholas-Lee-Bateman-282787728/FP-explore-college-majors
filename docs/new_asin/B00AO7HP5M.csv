5462984,5,B00AO7HP5M,"""Gaither Vocal Band, Pure and Sample"". This is one of the great and different dvd's. If you love southern gospel you will enjoy this great music.

5462985,5,B00AO7HP5M,"Nothing finer than the Gaither vocal band,what voices.....I can not wait til they have volume 2 out. I pre ordered this dvd and its awesome. I also love Joey & Rory and they are such a wonderful couple. Rory has written so many wonderful songs and he is gifted,he has a great voice . Joey is not only pretty but her voice is just amazing. You will enjoy this video and the places they travel. What a great team. GO GAITHERS.....",1361404800,2,428,4.296296296296297
5462986,5,B00AO7HP5M,There is nothing simple about the music these guys offer.  But it is pure Gospel that enriches my life in an incredible way.,1361318400,,124,4.391304347826087
5462987,5,B00AO7HP5M,"Volume one is becoming one of my all time favorite GVB productions. There is something for everyone here. My personal favorite is Michael English and he is phenomenal with his interpretation of ""The Old Rugged Cross Made The Difference"". I would have bought it for this one song alone. Amazing.",1360972800,10,294,4.9
5462988,5,B00AO7HP5M,The video is great.  Bill did it again. He brings so much wonderful uplifting music into our home. The only one missing is Guy Penrod..we miss him with the Gaither Band.,1360972800,,169,4.451612903225806
5462989,5,B00AO7HP5M,"Both volumes are excellent, but short, 65 minutes each.  The music and arrangements were excellent, as they were on the album.  Angela Primm has a couple of numbers in Vol. 2, and I don't believe it is possible to watch or hear her sing and not feel good.  The Booth Brothers were also in excellent form.  The band goes for a ride, and the clips from the ride were great fun.  Is Wes too nice?  The other four are a raucous bunch, as usual, and they piled on each other, as usual, but Wes is just too sweet to blast back.  An enjoyable experience all around.",1360886400,3,558,4.2075471698113205
5462990,5,B00AO7HP5M,"Since David Phelps and Mark Lowery are back with the group anything they do is great by me and this dvd supports that statement. The group seems to be having a ball during this taping and you have fun watching them. Not the usual Vocal Band music tho, it's more earthy and a nice switch. I just hope they don't go too far off the usual Gaither arrangements and stick to this format.",1360800000,,382,4.2465753424657535

5463013,3,B00AO7HP5M,"I haven't enjoyed any of their CD's since ""Gaither Vocal band Reunited"". In my opinion they hit their peak with Reunited.",1416528000,,121,4.809523809523809

5463019,5,B00AO7HP5M,"I loved this DVD. The Gaither Vocal Band here consists of Bill, Michael English, Wes Hampton, David Phelps, and Mark Lowry.  This one truly is Pure and Simple. All acoustical instruments. I think the cutest song they do is on this DVD ""Rasslin' Jacob."" I watch that one over and over. But to hear them sing ""The Love of God"" is worth the price of this DVD. It just brings tears to my eyes. Another great one on this recording is ""Glorious Freedom.""  The Booth Brothers sing a couple of very good songs. Also Joey and Rory sing one that's really good.  This DVD also includes some comedy from the five of them as they travel down the road in the SUV. Their DVDs have never disappointed me, and this one is no exception.",1405987200,3,718,4.343283582089552
5463020,5,B00AO7HP5M,"I bought this for my mother for her birthday.  She said she loves it.  I wish there was just 1 longer CD to buy instead of 2 shorter ones, but I guess they have to make money somehow.",1399420800,,183,3.789473684210526
5463021,4,B00AO7HP5M,"This is my second time in the past two weeks to have Amazon cut me off after I have written a review. I do not have the time to go over everthing I went over, folks. Sorry.

I had reviewed the wrong volume this time and wanted to correct the error. I give this four stars because it is shorter than the ones to which I gave five stars, and I thought the car rides were not photographed well.  I love this album much more than Volume Two.",1397865600,,437,3.9545454545454546

5463024,5,B00AO7HP5M,"I bought Vol. 1 and 2 for my folks, and what can I say...they absolutely love them! This album is a departure from some of the other Gaither Vocal Band albums, in that it has a more stripped-down, acoustic, rootsy and soulful sound. Fantastic vocal., great production and inspiring lyrics...I recommend it!",1386201600,2,306,4.903846153846154
5463025,5,B00AO7HP5M,"I really enjoyed this DVD.  My favorites were Come To Jesus with David Phelps.  I love that style of singing.  It's so plaintive.  My
other favorite on this DVD was The Old Rugged Cross Made The Difference.  This song has been one of my favorites for a long time,
both this one with Michael English and the older one with Guy Penrod.",1378339200,,333,4.306451612903226

5463027,5,B00AO7HP5M,"What can I say?....This is a fabulous DVD!  I love the ""new sound"" here.  The sweet simplicity of this music is great and I hope they do more on this order.  David Phelps singing ""Come to Jesus"" is not to be believed. I have listened to it over and over. His voice is definitely one of a kind.

 The Booth Brothers are very good also.  Now I will have to get Volume 2.:)",1375920000,5,370,4.0

5463034,5,B00AO7HP5M,"I DEARLY LOVE THE GAITHERS.  THEY COULD SING ""OLD MACDONALD"" IN HARMONY AND I WOULD LOVE IT.

5463035,5,B00AO7HP5M,"Both one and two where a certain blessing!  I hesitate to pick out just one member because they are an amazing unit, each bringing gifts and talents.
