We ordered this DVD as we are considering kayaking in Croatia this fall. We live in Austria, only a few hours away, and are experienced lake and sea kayakers. We thought this might help to focus our ""map recce"" and help us to locate not only areas where we could kayak - we can do that ourselves - but also to help with the often overlooked logistic problems of where and how we launch and land, and how and where we might store our kayaks.  Nothing of the sort is on this DVD.  In fact there is little of interest at all for knowledgable kayakers, and those who are not will learn equally little about kayaking - not where kayaks might be bought or rented, nor about instruction, nor about safety, navigation, meterology. Nothing in this DVD will be of use to anyone actually wanting to kayak in Croatia. Goodness only knows for whom it was made - possibly the authors are pleased with it. I can't imagine having a DVD of skiing in Austria which managed to tell me so little about skiing or about Austria. Go find a good guide book and a map.",1245974400,,1225,4.995098039215686
