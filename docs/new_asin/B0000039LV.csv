7902451,5,B0000039LV,"This is a must have for any Godzilla fan. This box set includes five of the most enjoyable G-Films ever made. It looks like a lot of care went into making this set, and the whole thing just looks plain good. A quick rundown of the movies:

1. Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster: A great film with a lot of funny stuff, but still some intense messages left over.

2. Son of Godzilla: The campiest Godzilla movie ever. Minilla looks like Gary Coleman! If you like to laugh at guys in rubber suits kicking each other's butts, this one's for you.

3. Godzilla vs. Gigan: A simply wonderful movie that you have to see to believe. Everything about it is so mind bogglingly terrible, you will be laughing so hard it hurts.

4. Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla: An awesome movie from the mid seventies that is so full of bright colors and cheesy music that it is nearly impossible not to like. If you care about it, the special effects are actually quite good.

5. Godzilla 1985: A real masterpiece, rivaling the original. The tone is VERY serious and the special effects have never been better. Raymond Burr is great in his role, and the end may just leave you crying.

If you care, or ever cared about the Big G, this is the box set for you.

7902452,5,B0000039LV,"Anchor Bay releases a five-tape box set of classic Godzilla films which features Godzilla 1985, Ghidrah The Three-Headed Monster, Godzilla Vs. Mecha-Godzilla, Son Of Godzilla, and Godzilla vs. Gigan. There is also another set which features ""Godzilla Vs. Megalon"" instead of ""Son"". In either case, this set is an excellent addition to any true Godzilla fan's collection.
GODZILLA 1985- Sequel to the first GODZILLA only with the return of Raymond Burr as Steve Martin. A more serious approach to the series. This was the first Godzilla movie I ever saw and as a result, this is one of my all-time favorites.
GHIDRAH THE THREE-HEADED MONSTER- Godzilla becomes a good guy as he joins forces with Rodan & Mothra to take on a new enemy, a three-headed dragon named Ghidrah from outer space. Not as campy as later entries but the scene where the monsters talk is a little silly. Classic Godzilla film.
GODZILLA VS. GIGAN- Godzilla joins forces with Angulias to take on Gigan and Ghidrah in a tag team brawl. Another excellent Godzilla movie.
GODZILLA VS. MECHAGODZILLA- Godzilla takes on his robot clone with the help of a giant ape-looking creature called King Seazar. Real good edition.
SON OF GODZILLA- Kind of silly but still pretty good. Godzilla and his son (who looks more like the Pilsbury Dough Boy then the son of Godzilla) take on a giant spider and some other big praying mantis creatures but eventually are defeated by harsh weather conditions. A little too cutesy for most but I still enjoyed it.",1060732800,3,1505,4.8828125
