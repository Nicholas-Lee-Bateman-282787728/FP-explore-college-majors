8206132,5,B000SOCADI,"This video is an exhuberant celebration of the creative genius of four giants of jazz guitar. The purpose of this video is to give those of us who were not fortunate enough to see these guitarists play live an opportunity to see their personalities.  Here are some of the observations that I made that are irrelevant to the lush richness of the music, but that made me feel like I learned something about the musicians:

1. Wes Montgomery smiling ebulliently as several times he dodges an errant microphone boom on Belgian public television.  Nothing bothered him.
2. A picture quality so clear that you can see the dust between the pickup and the neck on Joe Pass's guitar.
3. Herb Ellis scowling grouchily while his bassist is so happy to be playing with Herb Ellis that he nearly bounces off the dais on which he's perched.
4. The light glinting off the tuning head of Joe Pass's guitar like the Star of Bethlehem on a Christmas card.
5. An intensity in Barney Kessel's eyes that belies the beauty of the song he's playing.
6. Four guys who owned their music so completely that they dressed up in coats and ties (and ,in Joe Pass's case, a tuxedo) to celebrate themselves and the music they played.
7. Barney Kessel and Herb Ellis playing on Swedish public TV with sidemen who looked like they just stepped of a Viking longboat.
8. Joe Pass's humble demeanor that belies the intense concentration with which he burned up and down his fingerboard.
9. Did I mention that there are bonus Wes Montgomery tracks?  There are bonus Wes Montgomery tracks!

Every guitartist should own this video; there's a depth of emotion in the music that has been missing in popular music for at least 20 years.",1192147200,,1693,4.63
