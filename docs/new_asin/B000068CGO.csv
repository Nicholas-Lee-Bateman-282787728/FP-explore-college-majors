8186473,5,B000068CGO,"Excellent and Beautiful movie. It is based on Tibetan Buddhism and Buddha's teachings. I think that maybe is not for everyone since is some slow and could be ""shocking"" for practitioners from others religions. Nonetheless it could be really rewarded for anybody. It is wrapped with really insight teachings.",1293753600,2,307,5.285714285714286
8186474,5,B000068CGO,"This is a Bertolucci movie so it will naturally have his style. This is a different story so it should be told differently from his other films. In my opinion this is his best. It is based on a true story; this means he did not wake up in the middle of the night with a radical idea. The story is used not only for the individual incident but as an allegory for today's Tibetan (there are many other types) Buddhist way of thought.

These are not two parallel stories in contrast. With out one the other makes no sense. The section in Seattle is filtered in blue; I may have some deeper meaning; I see the blue filtered scenes as the superficial environment. These differences help with the description of impermanence.

The Selection of actors is excellent.. You do not want the actor personalities to overshadow the character. It is too late for me. I will always think of Siddhartha as looking like Keanu Reeves.

Just as with Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments "", the film story does not actually follow the written story of Siddhartha. However, as this is the one that I watch, therefore I will always think of this when some one mentions Buddha.",1256947200,4,1157,4.526315789473684
