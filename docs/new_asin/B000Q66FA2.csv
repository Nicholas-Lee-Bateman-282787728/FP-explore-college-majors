Here are the problems:

1. The instructor is from another country, spoke with a strong accent and made it difficult for me to understand what she was saying!

2. The instructional speaking/demonstration part of the dance was very BRIEF, taught the steps too quickly and was hard to follow because of the accent of the host.

3. I wish that I had saved my money and just watched videos on line instead!

3. The music was completely instrumental even when the dance was being done full out.",1398211200,,693,4.3
8608875,1,B000Q66FA2,"Wow, what a joke. The ""instructor"" with her minions does the dances in time with music, then about half time without music, then again with the music.  There's no breakdown or instruction whatsoever.  I should have saved my $ and youtubed the dances.  Bad ""Engrish"" to boot.",1312156800,,274,4.787234042553192
