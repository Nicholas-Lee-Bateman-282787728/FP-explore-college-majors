It has the perfect balance between comedy and drama, unique cast bonding, and above all a clean family-friendly Christian message.  Unlike some other christian films, the message is subtle yet strong and very thought worthy.  Very enjoyable film!!",1244851200,7,322,5.294117647058823
3870000,3,B0027W6HBA,"It is not the best among the US comedies of young adults (either Satanist or Gothics), in which a traditional thirst for riches is miraculously backed with both keeping a bag of money found, and partitioning the inherited assess.

It is really a watching for kids or if nowhere better time could be spend on.

Actually, it is hard to remember a story context longer than a few days afterwards, anyway.",1243728000,2,401,4.633802816901408
3870001,5,B0027W6HBA,"This is a great movie to watch with the whole family. It is fun, has a great message and especially is geared to connect with the younger generation, 9- 20 year olds. I would definitely recommend this.",1242777600,9,201,4.45945945945946
3870002,5,B0027W6HBA,"This one is a new family favorite there really isn't any negative content and we call it our ""Christian version of Nepoleon Dynamite"" such a funny and uplifting film. Really Recomend it!",1355184000,,186,4.84375
3870003,3,B0027W6HBA,"There are actually two movies that have been recently released with this name: one from 2011 with Milla Jovovich and Bill Pullman and one from 2009 with people you've probably never heard of. This review is for the second movie.

It's an indie Christian comedy with some drama elements that overall blend together very nicely. I'm not sure what vibe the directors were going for, or the script writers for that matter. The plot ends up solid, and I'll get to that shortly, but some of the scenes are just weird in how they were pulled together (the War Table scenes for example: the family dresses up in costumes, eats ice cream, and talks serious life issues) and some of the characters are so cliche that those aforementioned scenes become even more bizarre...cheesy even almost. The affair is almost reminiscent of skits you used to see in church: over the top characters to stress a point, crazy costumes from the church closet, etc. But the characters are likeable, and some of the comedy is genuinely funny, so the mix works.

The plot focuses around Bobby, the 16 year old little brother in the Wyler family. Mom and Dad passed on early and older brother James took on the role as parent and family pastor. Sister Andrea and other brother Dennis have long moved out, but Bobby's birthday is bringing everyone home for a reunion--that and the fact the inheritance is finally getting divided.

As the protagonist, we follow Bobby as he wrestles with Christianity, who he is, and his feelings for a new girl at school. Along the way, James continues to pour into him with legitimate Christian counsel, while his best friend's problems at home begin to weigh on in on the friendship. When things get crazy between the visiting siblings (who are the more cliche characters that somehow win you over) as their parents' will is revealed, everyone's spirituality is put to the test.

Now, hear me out. The preview is down below, and it confirms the cheesiness I warned about. But, the ending of this movie makes it all worthwhile. Bobby, the faith struggler, makes his stand for Jesus and it's pretty touching and emulation-worthy the way it plays out. So for me, the movie earned my applause. Some of the subplots are kind of annoying (Bobby and his interest in the new girl); some of the lines are a little wooden (especially between James and his love interest). But the focus on Jesus is a strong plus, and the real issues James and Bobby get into are very relatable to a Christian viewer.

All in all, I'm glad I purchased the film. I've watched it twice, and the replay value is there if there are new people to watch it with. Can I recommend it? Sure. It's only $5.50 new on Amazon, and the purchase supports independent Christian filmmakers. 3 out 5.",1353110400,,2757,4.6646090534979425
3870004,1,B0027W6HBA,I did not like this video at all.  It was boring and did not hold my interest.  My grandchildren made the same comment. Just wasn't for me.  Don't waste your money,1312156800,,163,4.193548387096774
3870005,5,B0027W6HBA,"I'm surprised how many really good messages were packed into this film. There is a lot of goofing around with each other(especially among the brothers), but those worthwhile life messages come through clearly. After many years a will is about to be settled among some people who lost both their parents, but beyond that there are many side stories that imperfect people with difficult lives can relate to, even if the scene is supposed to be funny. It's really about a family and their various friends trying to connect with one another. What I like about this movie is that the decisions are often weighed, even if only in advice, with the words in the scriptures. There are characters with serious problems, including an encounter with CPS, but the characters--at least most of them--really care about each other and the sacrifices that are made to help others and simply to make peace are so inspiring. I was surprised by the ending, too, because these kind of movies usually have all problems resolved by the time the closing credits roll, but this one leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Still, by the principles most of the characters live by, you will probably get the feeling they will do just fine. The acting is good and the plot is even better. We've bought this to enjoy and to share with others.",1290902400,3,1310,4.724890829694323
3870006,5,B0027W6HBA,"Watched this with my family and everyone of them laughed! It's a great film about living your faith. Christ's peace be with you all, Pastor Don Haselhuhn",1289865600,3,153,4.703703703703703
3870007,5,B0027W6HBA,"""Bringing Up Bobby"" is one of the funniest movies with a Christian theme that I've seen. My three youngest children, ages 19, 17 and 16 LOVED it and watched it over and over. You know how hard it is to get and keep a teenagers attention for very long, but this movie did that.
The reason I like this movie besides the hilarious parts {which are all through the movie} is the Christianity that is a major theme. Some movies just stick about God or being a Christian in one part, but ""Bringing Up Bobby"" has Christianity from start to finish. This movie shows us you can have a riot in life, but still have Jesus at the center.
""Bringing Up Bobby"" also is about reading wills, money, greed, child neglect, alcoholism and thinking you deserve everything. It also teaches even when things don't go your way you can still praise the Lord and keep on with a positive attitude.
Bobby just turning 16 doesn't know what he believes so his older brother/caregiver challenges him to read the book of John and find out what he believes. For Bobby's 16 birthday his older brother and sister say they came back to celebrate with him, but we find out they came back for the reading of the will, which happens 12 years after the death of their parents. You won't believe all of the fun and trouble this family of four and their friends get into. It is so fun and wonderful to watch a movie that is full of love for the Lord and just side splitting laughs.
The special features on this DVD are so cool. The film makers are two young brothers from OH, a great state. Outtakes, Home Movies from the set and Behind the scenes.
I highly recommend this movie for one and all.

3870009,5,B0027W6HBA,"This movie has a real life feel to it.  It show different problem people have and how they work through them. It is also very exciting, what is going to happen next, and very funny also.  Good movie for teens.  They will love it as will the whole Family.",1266710400,3,254,4.142857142857143
3870010,5,B0027W6HBA,"As an actor in the movie, I know I am somewhat biased towards this film (I play the part of the car salesman).  That being said, I have only good things to say about the entire production of this film: the shooting, the editing, and the way the actors (even bit players such as myself) were treated by the director and producer--all were handled professionally and with extreme attention to detail.

Generally speaking, I'm not a fan of most ""Christian"" movies because they are usually so heavy-handed and didactic.  ""Bringing Up Bobby"" has the requisite Christian message, but there is much more to the movie than the basic testimony one would expect.  There is a message that transcends the ""family circle of believers"" who would watch this movie regardless of how well it was written or how good the production values are.  ""Bringing Up Bobby"" has genuine comedy moments and delivers a real theme that appeals to a wide range of viewers, both Christian and non-Christian.  That is where this movie separates itself from the run-of-the-mill movies of the religious genre.

Not only was this movie a pleasure to make, it remains a pleasure to watch.  It is an honor to have been associated with it as well.  Kudos to Nick and Chris Staron for their dedication and diligence in creating this movie!",1252281600,4,1298,4.7847533632287
3870011,5,B0027W6HBA,"I missed the first 15 minutes of this, but thouroughly enjoyed the rest of the movie.  Great life lessons to be learned for youth and young adults as this deals with who you are and your identity, particularly faith.

8355219,1,B0027W6HBA,"Very positive message that gets buried by the positive gains of very undesirable and negative characters who are greedy, loveless, undeserving, and unwilling to accept responsibility.  The sister was a money hungry person who showed no love for anyone but herself and yet she was handsomely rewarded despite the wishes of her parents in their will.  The judge didn't do his job effectively by putting off the simple task of issuing a death certificate and held a grudge against a young man who was fighting to keep his family together which caused him to lose the house that was rightfully his.  The fact that everyone got something in the end means nothing when at least one of those people were undeserving and greedy.  The beautiful message of Christian values seems to have fallen upon deaf ears with the negative agendas of greed and laziness shown by Andrea and the judge..",1487808000,,879,4.84
