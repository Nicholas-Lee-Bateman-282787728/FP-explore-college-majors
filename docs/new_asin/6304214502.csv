812892,5,6304214502,"One of Mann's best, hands-down. The big news of course are DeNiro and Pacino, and they are great -- separately and in their big scene together. But the entire ensemble here is great -- Val Kilmer, Danny Trejo, Tom Sizemore, and Dennis Haysbert in the crew of criminals; Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Mykelti Williamson in the cop crew; Ashley Judd, Diane Venora, Natalie Portman, and Amy Brenneman in the women who suffer collateral damage hanging being involved with single-minded men; Tom Noonan, Hank Azaria, Jon Voight, William Fichtner, and Henry Rollins in bit parts that are nevertheless utterly believable. No one is wasted. The casting just feels so perfect, you can't imagine any other actors in these parts -- and everyone is so convincing in their roles they immerse you in the world of their characters.

Pacino is, as usual, kind of over the top in some scenes, but its at least played as the kind of aggression and attitude a cop would use to intimidate criminals and maintain his edge, his authority, and probably his sanity. DeNiro is far more understated, but it serves his character as well -- the master thief, the planner, the plotter, the one who is cautious and canny enough to walk away when he feels the heat around the corner.

The tension of the plot builds and builds to an inevitable conflict and confrontation. The people who complain this is too long and too boring are the types who need constant cross cuts and short cuts, who cannot sustain attention for long takes -- products of the music video/video game era.  I saw this in theaters when it first came out and my bf and I were riveted and at the edge of our seats. We had no idea it was nearly 3 hours. It didn't feel like it at all.

In a way this film is a lot about the consequences of one's actions -- in both the long term and in the long term, eg life long actions and choices. It is a crime film, but it isn't just a heist film. It's a meditation on the way past choices affect present and future choices (both quantity and quality), and affect the people close to us as well, like ripples spreading. It's a thoughtful examination of the relationship of cops and criminals, and the ironic similarities between the most driven of both. It's almost philosophical about the similarities in the single-mindedness and drive of the career criminal and career cop and the way they similarly de-prioritize everything else, including their close relationships with the women in their lives, if they have one.

And yet, it's one hell of a suspense film, superbly crafted and meticulously edited. Everything -- the camera work, the composition within the frame, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the screenplay, the editing, the acting -- combines into a sleek greyhound of a story that runs, and keeps running -- and keeps you following, until the very end.",1501027200,2,2837,4.7002012072434605
812893,5,6304214502,"Existential Crime  a review/essay of the film: HEAT (1995)
 Directed/written by Michael Mann & Music by Elliot Goldenthal
Starring:  Robert De Niro & Al Pacino
 H. J.  Spencer  (July 2015)
ABSTRACT
This is the quintessential film about the two opposing sides in the never-ending Crime War: here the dedicated cops and the master criminals (they need) play at the top of their game.  Michael Mann is a mans director (pun intended).  He explores people, especially men, in extremis and the effect they have on the women around them; women who would always choose love, not death.  But, apart from real war, few men ever experience living on the existential edge, where a bad decision (or just bad luck) will end it forever for them: but this beats living an ordinary dull life  a life without significance.
SUMMARY
The Crime Movie is now embedded in American consciousness almost as much as the Western was in the earlier days of film.  There are many sub-types; from the flamboyant trivia of terror from Tarantino to the psychopathic obsessionals, like Natural Born Killers.  However, for realistic views of the top of the line professional criminals, few can beat Michael Mann.  He keeps returning to the genre but Heat will probably always be his masterpiece.  Mann not only produced and directed it but wrote the script and sometimes did his own camera work, even though he keeps a dedicated team of technicians around most of the time. One of his personal touches is to enhance our empathy for what his fictional characters are feeling by using very appropriate background music, which is good enough to sell on its own CD.  One of the most moving pieces is Mobys transcendental God Moving Over the Face of the Waters that plays out as the film reaches its dramatic climax. In this film, Mann uses Elliott Goldenthal to provide a strong and consistent mood throughout.  Goldenthal brings classical training from his education with Aaron Copeland and it shows here in many symphonic touches as well as using first-class musicians like the Kronos Quartet to perform his own music.  This unity of vision by such a small team of cohesive, creative talents brings out the best from Hollywoods top actors, such as Robert De Niro (playing master-criminal Neil McCauley  actually a real Chicago criminal of the 1960s) who here is being hunted down by one of LAPDs top homicide/robbery detectives: Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (played by Al Pacino) with his usual intensity here, where it is totally convincing for a policeman sinking under the endless repetitions of evil brought on LAs citizenry by the whole range of criminals.  This persistent psychological pressure on Hanna has wrecked two of his earlier marriages and we see him repeating this self-defeating strategy with his latest wife Justine, played by the irresistible Diane Venora, who loves him in spite of all the trauma he brings into her life.  Ultimately, she takes a loser as a lover to make Hanna jealous but to no avail.  Again, director Mann portrays the real powerful tensions between adults, who are emotionally embroiled together within a fearsome situation bigger and deadlier than anyone can survive.  He shows how an intelligent sociopath, like McCauley, has thrown away the chance at love in his life by always being ready to walk away in 30 seconds.  But, now this may be his last chance with a relationship developing with a smart graphics designer Eady, played by that sharp lady, Amy Brenneman, who is drawn to him in spite of her intelligent warning instincts. This quartet of superb characters, played convincingly by some of Hollywoods best, are backed up by a strong second line, including Val Kilmer (McCauleys loyal number two, Chris Shiherlis) and his own loyal wife, Charlene (played by Ashley Judd).  I always find it a pleasure watching Wes Studi (starred in Manns marvelous Last of the Mohicans and here hes Hannas loyal sidekick, detective Sam Casals. Another solid actor is Tom Sizemore (McCauleys long-time loyal side-kick, Mike Ceritto), who gives the impression he could explode at any moment.
Interestingly, De Niro was the first cast member to see the film script and was so enthusiastic that he showed it to Pacino, who also wanted a role in the film.  De Niro believed from the beginning that Heat was going to be a great movie because of its very good story, built around believable characters with a true sense of reality and authenticity.  In order to prepare the actors for the roles of McCauley's crew, Mann took Kilmer, Sizemore and De Niro to maximum security Folsom State Prison (near Sacramento) to interview actual career criminals. While researching her own role, Ashley Judd met several former prostitutes who became housewives, like her character Charlene.  Additionally, the character of Nate is closely based on a real-life former career criminal and fence turned writer, who served as a consultant to Mann on the film.  To make the long bank shootout more realistic Mann hired British retired SAS sergeant (and author) Andy McNab as a technical weapons trainer and adviser.  McNab designed a three months weapons training curriculum to train the actors using live ammunition, before shooting with blanks for the actual take.  He also worked with training them for the bank robbery. All the filming was done on location around Los Angeles.

I am always fascinated by great movies that explore the existential dread that a few men become aware of as they realize how meaningless are much of their lives.  Men in war know this and battle becomes an overwhelming drug to raise their ordinary lives to the edge of living or dying.  Women are fortunate, especially those with children who give their mothers lives firm meaning, especially through the  existential (life and death) experience of giving birth to another human being.  Perhaps, this is why so few women seek the thrill of warfare: adding links to the Great Chain of Being is sufficient reward. Auteur Mann gives the viewer a big hint that hes exploring this theme in this film in the centerpiece scene in the coffee shop exchanging opinions on their own life-choices: neither would do anything else  they are hooked. Apparently, this scene actually happened with the real criminal (actually called McCauley) and the Chicago detective who hunted him down.  Even the film dialogue here was copied from reality.  This scene shows how nominal enemies are not only very alike but need each other to give genuine excitement to their lives.  The breaking of this mutual dependency reaches the level of high drama and pathos in the final chase and shootout between them near the runways at LAX.  I will not give too much away but say that the survivor realizes he too has lost the game with the death of his chief rival.

Even though this epic lasts almost 3 hours that challenges those with short attention spans, here the carefully crafted scenes, like the $12 million downtown failed bank holdup (that concludes with an incredible shoot-out) and the adult dialogue between these fully drawn characters keeps the intelligent movie fan totally absorbed.  Like any good story-teller, Mann plants a sub-plot around the stupid mistakes of a new addition to the gang (Waingro) made in the opening armored-car robbery and the later betrayal to the LAPD about the planned bank heist that forces McCauley to miss his escape to New Zealand, as he brings Waingro to his just demise, at his airport hotel.  There are other evil criminals shown here, such as white-collar thief, Roger van Zant (played convincingly here by William Fichtner, who always plays really bad types) who will cheat McCauley when laundering the $1.6 million in bearer-bonds stolen in the first scene.  Meanwhile, Jon Voight is the fence and loyal friend (Nate), who looks out for Neils best interests. So, there are shades of good and bad people shown in this realistic portrayal of modern serious crime.  In fact, the action high point in the movie is the huge shootout when the police ambush McCauleys betrayed team in the streets of LA.  It is not only extremely exciting to watch but it inspired real-life copycat bank robberies in North Hollywood in 1997 and armored car robberies in South Africa, Columbia, Denmark and Norway.  Emulation is the sheerest form of praise.

I can watch this movie over and over again (and have watched it 6 times) as it reveals new insights and details, even though the tension, violence and stupid mistakes keep happening.  It is number one in my crime movie genre. This is a film that movie buffs will still be watching in 50 years; so ignore the realistic violence and go see this masterpiece investigation of people facing the major crises in their lives.  This is what true drama is about, learning from the artificial portrayal of human emotions in a realistic setting.  The good news for Mann is that he only spent $60 million making this movie but it has grossed almost five times that to date, so he will continue to make more great movies for the rest of us, particularly as 86% of the film critics really liked it as well; one international film critic wrote that Heat was: ""one of the most intelligent crime-thrillers to come along in years"", and also said Pacino and De Niro's scenes together were ""poignant and gripping"".",1500595200,,9296,4.923126201153107

813307,5,6304214502,"Al Pacino and Robert De Niro became megastars in the second half of the 20th century when they played Michael and Vito Corleone in the Francis Ford Coppola classics The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather II (1974), but they never shared a scene together because they played characters in different eras. They finally met on screen face-to-face in Michael Manns film Heat, in which Pacino portrays Lieutenant Vincent Hanna of the LAPD, hot on the trail of career criminal Neil McCauley, played by De Niro. Heat is based on the true story of a real Neil McCauley, a calculating criminal and ex-Alcatraz inmate who was tracked down by Det. Chuck Adamson in 1964. In April 1994, Mann was reported to have abandoned his earlier plan to shoot a biopic of James Dean in favor of writing and directing Heat, producing it with Art Linson. The film was marketed as the first on-screen appearance of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino together in the same scene. Pacino and De Niro were Mann's first choices for the roles of Hanna and McCauley, respectively, and they both immediately agreed to appear in the film. For the restaurant sequence where McCauley and Hanna finally meet, Michael Mann ran two cameras simultaneously in order to generate a greater level of fluidity between the rivals. Since there were no rehearsals for the scene, this approach allowed both men a more generous margin for improvisational experimentation. Though Pacino and Robert De Niro share only a handful of screen minutes together, Heat is an engrossing crime drama that draws compelling performances from its stars  and confirms Michael Mann's mastery of the genre. The film also stars Val Kilmer, Diane Venora, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, William Fichtner, Ted Levine, Hank Azaria and Natalie Portman. The movie was shot in 65 locations around Los Angeles, without a single soundstage. The explicit nature of several of the film's scenes was cited as the model of a spate of robberies since its release. This included armored car robberies in South Africa, Colombia, Denmark, and Norway and most famously the 1997 North Hollywood shootout, in which Larry Phillips, Jr. and Emil Mtsreanu robbed the North Hollywood branch of the Bank of America and, similarly to the film, were confronted by the LAPD as they left the bank. This shootout is considered one of the longest and bloodiest events of its type in American police history. Both robbers were killed, and eleven police officers and seven civilians were injured during the shootout. Heat was widely referenced during the coverage of the shootout. Heat was a commercial success, grossing $67 million in the United States and $187 million worldwide (about $291 million in 2016) against a $60 million budget. It was well received by critics. This was one of Christopher Nolan's favorite films. It inspired his vision of Gotham City in The Dark Knight Trilogy.",1466035200,27,2889,4.9937759336099585

The plot is somewhat familiar and nothing all that innovative, still director Michael Mann knows how to create a captivating and nocturnal atmosphere, offering some interesting visuals and professionally filmed scenes. The character development is also above average for a movie like this, providing a couple of tense and intriguing moments. It`s also refreshing to watch L.A. at night, making for some worthwile sequences (the climatic conflict, for example). Although good, ""Heat"" runs for way too long, and a three-hour-long movie is not something I would watch much more than once.

813584,5,6304214502,"Heat is a superb movie and it receives five stars from me. The total story is realistically put together with an all-star team of actors. With an all-star studded cast such as this, this movie could not be anything less than a success.
 The movie is very realistically put together because it shows not only can police be intelligent but also in some cases they can be out smarted by criminals. Each time in this movie when Robert DeNiro's criminal ring engaged in some sort of criminal activity they new the polices responding time. This enabled them to move faster then the police so they were not caught, they literally had their criminal plans broken down to a science. It was very interesting and exciting in how Robert Deniro's ""crew"" eluded the police. In some cases it was even comical, such as the particular instance when the police were watching the criminals and thought that had a jump on the next hit, only to be disappointed by the fact that they were the one's being watched.
 A very exciting and action packed scene of this movie was the bank robbery. The bank robbers strapped with high power weapon successfully came away with money from the bank only to be shocked to see police outside. At this point the excitement starts as shots rang out from both sides and the viewer is put on the edge of their seat hoping that the criminals getaway as they engage in a high speed chase with the cops. I think the director is very successful in making you route for the wrong person, "" the bad guy.""
 I think the director takes somewhat of a joy in tricking the viewer. First the director achieves the goal of making the viewer route for the criminals. Then one by one, without the viewer even noticing he eliminates, this criminal team of masterminds, who had seemed to be untouchable. Then with most of this team dead, he leaves Val Kilmer and the star Robert DeNiro. I think he was smart to let the viewer believe that the star would get away and live happily ever after with his attractive love interest. He surprises the viewer, and kills the star off but he spares the viewer at the end and lets Val Kilmer's character getaway buy chance.
 The movie Heat has all the components to be proven to be a very good movie. It has a very good structured plot, it has romance, excitement, and it keeps the viewer guessing. All of these components on top of an all-star cast could receive nothing but a five star rating from me.",1070150400,3,2434,4.5

This movie in a way reminds me of a modern day ""Wild Bunch"", although these guys probably have more in the way of human feeling, although not much more.  People who get in the way get shot.  DeNiro's is a very high risk profession and the biggest risk is who you have working with you.  The enlistment of Waingrow at the start of the show turns out being a big mistake.  I don't see how he could have gotten away from them in the parking lot though.  DeNiro banged him up and surely would have heard him crawling away.  If you demand realism this show will be a disappointment but it is realistic enough to make you overlook what isn't.

813742,5,6304214502,"There are at least two main reasons why this movie is exceptional:
1) Robert De Niro  2) Al Pacino
Two of the greatest actors in American cinema together in a film that isn't just a motion picture..it's a masterpiece!!
Who do we have to thank for this? None other than Michael Mann.
Al Pacino plays L.A. detective Vincent Hanna. Hanna is an expert crime fighter who's always at least one step ahead of his prey. His work is obsessive and he uses all of his energy to chase guys around the block and by the time he gets home to his third wife, Justine (Diane Venora), and suicidal step-daughter, Lauren (Natalie Portman), he unfortunately has no more energy to give. Thus, putting his personal life, or perhaps lack thereof, in jeopardy. In a nutshell, Hanna's life is a mess emotionally. There's no rationality whatsoever. As he says so himself, ""My life is a disaster zone."" He's the clever cat constantly chasing the mice of Los Angeles.
Robert De Niro plays Neil McAuley, an ace thief whose obsession is taking scores. Vowing to never go back to Folsom, he ducks underneath L.A.P.D's radar and starts to put together the strategies he and his crew need in order to commit the 'perfect' crime. He's not a regular dumb criminal, but a highly intelligent one. In contrast to Hanna's life, Neil's life is completely under control. He has a 'coolness' about his personality and the way he handles things. In the midst of his drive to rob a bank, he meets a shy, young book clerk named Eady, whom he finds himself attracted to. His plan is to take down the bank and leave Los Angeles, taking Eady with him. However, he makes a fatal mistake of seeking out the man responsible for messing up a crime that takes place in the beginning of the film. And it all unfolds from there...
This film is absolutely a marvel! The bank-heist sequence is perfectly staged and choreographed. The result? One of the most AWESOME action scenes to grace the screen in a good while. But perhaps the best scene in the film is the one in which cat and mouse, Hanna and McAuley, sit down and have a cup of coffee. The whole scene is hypnotizing. Here are these two men, both different in terms of who they are, and how they live their lives, exchanging secrets that they would never tell their collegues. What's revealed is a mutual respect and understanding of each other, but also the reality that if they get in each other's way, they'll have to take the other down. The ending is so moving. I'm not gonna give it away, but take my word for it! :)
De Niro and Pacino give outstanding performances. They both play off each other very well and when you're watching this movie, it's difficult to get distracted. :) In my opinion, De Niro looks as handsome as ever and Pacino looks great in his suits. :)
Supporting roles from Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Tom Sizemore, Wes Studi, Diane Venora, and Amy Brenneman offer the icing on the cake.
Michael Mann's direction, story-telling, and cinematography is top-notch and his use of an ambivalent soundtrack is breath-takingly beautiful.
So..for those who haven't seen this film, I suggest you do! :)

813743,4,6304214502,"By virtue of the casting, this movie is further elevated to a new level above and beyond the already above average script, dialogue and fast paced action herein.

Robert DeNiro as villain -vs- Al Pacino as detective on the case, a pairing that we've never seen before, is exciting. I'd love to see these two together again, because there is just something magical about seeing these two veteran talents together on screen.

The best scene in the movie is the meeting that DeNiro and Pacino have sitting face to face at the restaurant table.  The tension,  and the mind games between the two seem very real.  I also loved the final showdown which did make me sad, because I cared about the characters. I do think, that a quality movie will make you care about the characters. In ""Heat"" there are certainly plenty of interesting characters played by high profile talents such as Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, and Val Kilmer.  They really enhance and support the Pacino and DeNiro roles well.  Pacino and DeNiro always bring any script to it's pinnacle.  While I find that Pacino tailors his acting to the roles he plays, while incorporating them into his own personality...DeNiro seems to always play himself. DeNiro is fascinating whether he's Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"" or a ""Raging Bull"" Jimmy Conway in ""Goodfellas"" or even when playing comedy such as in ""Analyze This.""  No matter what the film venue, Robert DeNiro's ordinary, is always extraordinary.

I didn't find that the movie felt too long, certain stories can't be wrapped up in the average running time of most films. There were moments where the plot intentions became vague and confusing.  I definitely recommend at least two viewings for an enriched understanding of all the elements in this complicated and engrossing story.

Amazingly, this has, to date, been the only chance a movie buff who loves Pacino and DeNiro can get two great talents for one admission!  For that reason alone, one thing is for sure, for real excitement with superb casting, you CAN'T beat the ""Heat.""",1009152000,3,2043,4.869942196531792

813838,3,6304214502,"What is demonstrated most clearly in HEAT is the different directions taken by De Niro and Pacino in the 20+ years since they were young actors in THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER PART II.
Pacino, who was such a thrill to watch in his early days, is now almost unbearable. He's lost any sense of subtlety or depth. In THE GODFATHER there was a quiet rage, an anger and intensity that bubbled just under his surface that was just amazing to watch. Now he just screams every line. In HEAT he cackles and yells in every scene, hollering at traffic, hollering at his wife, hollering at De Niro, hollering out his breakfast order...it just never stops. 'Round about SCARFACE Pacino stopped being an actor--and he'd been a great one up until that point--and started being a very bad caricature of himself. I call it the Marty Scheen syndrome.
De Niro, on the other hand, was already great at GODFATHER PART II, and has spent his time since then perfecting his craft. He's become the best actor of his generation, (unless you put Jack Nicholson in the same generation, and then it's a tie), an actor who can do action, thrillers, comedy--whatever. He is the best.
As for the film itself, I'm not as taken with it as many others seem to be. It's a good action flick, but I wouldn't put DIE HARD in the same category as APOCOLYPSE NOW, if you get my drift. HEAT is good at what it tries to do, but I don't know that it tries to do very much.
All this talk of ""dissecting the psychology"" of a cop and a criminal, finding out they're not that different, yadda yadda yadda--what a load of whooey. The conversation De Niro and Pacino have over a cup of coffee, which could have been a great set piece for both their careers and a moment movie fans would be able to recall like Bogie getting drunk in CASABLANCA or Brando emerging from the darkness in APOCOLYPSE NOW, is tedious and contrived. Pacino appears to make several blundering ad-libs, and you wouldn't be surprised to see De Niro come out of character long enough to ask him what the heck he's doing.
And Val Kilmer's part is virtually non-existent. Kilmer is a hit or miss actor--he hit on all cylinders in TOMBSTONE, missed on all in BATMAN--and this is mostly a miss.",997142400,8,2215,4.485148514851486

There are a lot of thought-provoking elements in the story that are made believable by the excellent direction of Mann (such as the suicide attempt of a 13-year old girl and the murder of a teen prostitute) that helps hit home one of the movie's messages that there is a very ugly reality out there, and it's not just in the movies.  ""Heat"" was a very well-cast movie.  The chemistry between Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino's characters is electrifying, and Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore play very good supporting roles.

Others will see a morality tale about good and evil played out with women  in the background, but actually in the forefront of our consciousness.  I  wish this part had been more fully developed.

Charlene, played by Ashley  Judd, swaps her men around, searching for the best deal, the one who will  best provide for her and the one she can best manipulate.  Justine, played  by Diane Venova, cannot help but choose the workaholic super cop (Pacino)  because he is so superior to any other man she's ever met, particularly to  her first husband, the uncaring father of her adolescent girl.  But her  life will never be secure because he is always leaving her alone so he can  chase criminals because that is what he really loves.
Some of this is a  mafia-style film without the mafia.  We have the same worshipful attitude  toward those who thumb their noses at society and give orders that must be  obeyed, super macho guys who bond together and follow the code, guys who  can out shoot and out fight mere mortals.  This is part of the fantasy.  We  see the expensive cars and the dinners with the beautiful women and the  adorable children at fancy restaurants as part of the booty of being men  who aren't afraid to take what they want regardless of risk.  These men  will always have the pick of the herd because, if successful, their mates  know they will get a lot of the goodies of this world, and if unsuccessful,  there's always the next risk taker who might succeed.
This is a complex  film and I would have to view it twice to make sure it all fits.  Being a  thriller, I know off hand that it won't.  Thrillers unravel.  But life is  too short to view this twice, so I will say I wasn't offended by the  unlikely events: the fact that the touted bank robbery scene was like a war  scene filmed with surround sound effects and jittery camera immersions and  bullets flying everywhere-semi-plausible even if nobody seemed to run out  of ammunition.  The robbery of the armored truck was nicely done except  that the tire-puncturing chain strewn across the street for the pursuing  cop cars seemed a bit stagy, and the whole thing required the most  exquisite timing.  In the uncompleted break-in there was a familiar  ""Mission Impossible"" tension-filled race against the clock that seemed  authentic, but probably wasn't.  The Los Angeles environs, especially the  final scene at LAX, provided atmospheric locales that made everything seem  real and immediate.
Where I think director Michael Mann went astray was  his insistence on giving the audience the expected confrontation between  the two big stars, a subplot that reached its low point with the phony  bonding scene with De Niro the bad guy and Pacino the good guy having  coffee together and exchanging dreams like blood brothers.  This mutual  admiration society was right out of some WWII film in which the American  general admires the courage and cunning of his Nazi counter part and vice  versa.  De Niro's final line was a little corny, but Pacino's squeezing  his hand reminded me of the way a big cat lovingly licks its prey after  killing it.  Bottom line though, Pacino and De Niro made us believe, or at  least suspend judgment for awhile, and that is what Hollywood is all about.",967852800,8,3975,4.642547033285094
813999,4,6304214502,"The movie directed by Micheal Mann is an epic masterpiece. The understated direction seemed to enhance the DeNiro and Pacino performances. The movie  seemed very real and gritty.
DeNiro played a character that you may find  oddly compelling. He was at times no different than a tough Wall Street  executive - except he settled business with a gun - sometimes. And Pacino  played a character that the only real difference between him and DeNiro was  that Al's character wore a badge.
Both were men of honor. One of them  choose a path that conflicted with the values of society. Does that make  him (DeNiro) any less honorable?
The acting and dialogue were believable.  The action scenes were intensely dramatic.
The bottom line: the movie is  only for those who like their protagonists/antagonists real. If you're  expecting to see heroic feats performed by one dimensional people then skip  this movie.

De Niro & Pacino are outstanding in this top class movie with support players Val  Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Michael Madsen et al merely adding their  considerable talents to a great action thriller.
Previous reviewers have  laready drawn attention to the bank robbery scene as being one of the most  impressive on film. I can only recall the station scene from 'The  Untouchables' as being equally memorable.
The interplay between De Niro  & Pacino in the now famous 'coffee scene' is a collision of two major  modern talents and equally impressive for totally different reasons - the  grudging respect shines through.
Professional is a largely overworked  term but it applies throughout this movie - both from a sorytelling as well  as an acting and production point of view.
It misses 5 stars only because  of the director's introduction of a 'neat, tucked away' ending with the  pre-requisite corpse. Throughout the movie De Niro remains steadfast to his  philosophy that he would walk away without looking back if the heat were  on. I believe we should have rolled credits immediately after the 'unspken  realisation' where he and his newly acquired lover/companion realise the  heat is truly on and that it is over for them by quirk of circumstance. Was  it really necessary to add anything else - least of all a tedious chase  onto the runway of the airport?

It's success can be attributed to Michael Mann and the cast he formulated around him. Mann paints the picture with  the same mordernist palette he utilised for Manhunter, his city existing in  the cold tones of grey and blue, only truly alive while Pacino and De Niro  fight it out on the streets. The pair are seen on the screen together for  the first time, and their chemistry is emphatic (one only needs to watch LA  Takedown to realise the contrast). The action scenes are quite unlike any  other film in their devotion to realism, Andy McNab, the famed SAS soldier  was the technical advisor on the film and it shows. As Pacino and De Niro  trade bullets in the street, they are forced to reload, carry wounded  buddies, and actually appear to genuinely move as if under fire.  Mann has  been described as the most intelligent director working in mainstream  Hollywood and there is certainly evidence enough in Heat, but what it  really shows is his place as one of the paramount visual stylists in the  entire film industry.",961632000,,1137,4.648241206030151

In the comfort of your home,  though, you can better absorb the character flourishes, the dialogue  drowned out in the theater, and either love or hate Pacino's over the top  line readings (I was so glad Mann vindicated his direction of Al in Heat  with the actor's only recent downplayed performance in this year's The  Insider) while marvelling at how, aw, screw it, COOL Deniro is in this.

814169,5,6304214502,"The twentieth century produced some pretty interesting films.  It almost makes me excited to see what we can accomplish in this century.  But the twentieth century can create hundreds of extrordinary crime films like the incredible ""L.A. Confidential"" or the masterpeice ""The Usual  Suspects"", only one has ever struck me so deep that I can confidently  say it is my favorite crime-oriented film ever.  It is a tough competition,  but ""Heat"" has so many incredible elements, competition becomes a  memory.  This film, a glossy, gritty, pure, emotional, and powerful  character-study, delves into the volatile black and white existence of  crime in L.A., primarily focusing on the skillful and intelligent heists  performed by a band of uneasy theives.  This gang, comprised of a genius  leader (DeNiro), a relationship-troubled right-hand man (Kilmer), and a  sadistic killer (Sizemore), face off with an intuitive and remarkable  detective (Pacino), who threatens the gang of theives at whatever occasion  possible, but always cautious.  Pacino, playing a man so good at his job  that his remaining life rots, finds a common ground in that respect with  DeNiro, also a capable and intelligent pro who leaves little verve in his  personal life.  The characterization of these two are performed well,  extremely well for that matter, and whatever surrounds them seems  enlightened with this perfection.  However, the film is due more credit to  the directing and cinematography than anything (well, perhaps the  soundtrack is a good rival at that.)  Ultimately, ""Heat"" is about  the point at which these mirror images meet, and what they have standing  behind them that eats away at their integrity and focus.  In fair warning  they finally confront eachother, but the situation lacks a sense of  rivalry, rather, courtesy.  It's quite a contrast to an enviroment of  violence, hate, depression, and social darwinism, but a welcome one, that  peers into the soul of this life scheme: that men conflict eachother, and  do what they do because that's the way things are, that is their life.  And  it's respected here as a common passion, a passion for your craft.  It's  inevitable that they will cross eachother, but will do so knowing that each  man is no different from the other; they play the same game on different  teams.  Some people will complain about the film's length, but if the film  were any different than it is, the results would be disastrous and  unforgivable.  What we have here is a profound gesture of insight into the  criminal-law enforcement relationship, one that details a rare but true  understanding of crime and it's contenders, of two lives that deal with  similair issues in a depressing and sadistic world.  It is only a tragic  coincidence that these two men's places have been taken against eachother.  However, nothing can be done to make what must happen eventually any  easier, not even the law.  This film is highly stylized and chalk full of  violence and colorful-metaphors, but you won't find violence this mature  and real anywhere else, especially with the explosive intensity.  ""Heat"" comes from that deep place, that primal but true dominion  in the human soul, the bluest flame one can see without being burned.  I  think that the extremities to which this film delivers its audience is what  makes the film in its entirety.  The less than subtle truth of  understanding that awakens between the distant geniuses contributes to this  timeless masterpeice. I cried at the end of this film.",954633600,5,3532,5.085964912280701
814286,2,6304214502,"Michael Mann's thriller which pits cop Pacino against ruthless robber De Niro has caused a lot fuss among critics and audiences. After seeing it for myself I can't understand why. Heat is an average thriller that has been  given little extra depth and a lot of extra gloss. Both De Niro's and  Pacino characters are well-worn clich&eacute;s: Pacino as an angst ridden cop on  his third marriage and De Niro as a psychotic villain who arranges his life  so that he can drop everything at 30 seconds notice when the heat is on.  Although Mann's visual style is breathtaking, presenting a stark vision of  LA, his script is a mess. Padded with irrelevant characters and sub-plots  it substitutes intrigue for plot confusion and eventually produces a mouse  of an idea: that morality and purpose alone, separates police and  criminals. The 3-hour running time is sheer self-indulgence when both  characters are unlikeable and uninteresting as Mann fills most of the time  with boring moralising as character development. When the action sequences  do come, they are brilliantly staged, but their impact is deadened by the  fact that the audience doesn't care which character survives. In my view  audiences have been sold a dummy of a film on the premise of Pacino and De  Niro coming together on screen. Yet neither actor gives a performance that  is anywhere near to their best. De Niro goes for the minimalist approach,  while Pacino spend most of his screen time shouting.

814288,5,6304214502,"I estimate that Director/Writer Michael Mann could have cut about an hour out of ""Heat"" and still have a pretty good movie, but I am glad he didn't. ""Heat"" is an outstanding film- a tour-de-force duel  between an elite crew of bank robbers led by Robert DeNiro and an elite  crew of police officers led by Al Pacino. This is a movie you have to savor  for each and every scene.
Mann does an outstanding job writing a complex  movie. Just about a bank robbery movie? Nope, the heroes and villains are  complicated and have their motives. Mann understands that the most  interesting hero is one with flaws (Pacino's cop is a workaholic ruining  his latest marriage) and the best villains are ones with their own agenda  and their own code (DeNiro has a philosophy and a noble goal- to do one big  score, leave and live the good life).
The acting talent Mann assembles is  awesome- Pacino, DeNiro, Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore,  Amy Brenneman, Natalie Portman, and Mykelti Williamson. All give great  performances.  Al Pacino is terrific as usual here, but I have the most  respect of all for Robert DeNiro. DeNiro may be the best actor alive- who  else could play his twisted, creepy psycho in ""Cape Fear"", his  cold gangster roles in ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", his  funny gangster in ""Analyze This"", and his action hero mercenary  in ""Ronin""? And this is only a fraction of the parts he's played!  Here he plays the cold, calculating leader of the bank robbers, the  worthiest adversary Al Pacino's cop has ever come up against.

I think the running time helps.  Characters are given room to roam, story lines are set up and explored fully.  You don't feel cheated.
De Niro conveys menace with his usual  flair, and I think his character is more interesting than Pacino's.  One  exception is Pacino's scene with his wife after the wedding reception.  The  wife's calm assessment and dissection of their crumbling marriage is one of  the most poignant pieces of writing I have heard.  Many hold the De  Niro/Pacino coffee shop scene up as the best ""talking heads""  scene in the film, but I disagree, this is.
Shooting on entirely on  location is a very large part of my love of the film and also enhances the  films authentic air.  An example is the scene where De Niro and Voight talk  about the re-sale of the bearer bonds after the purchase of the bank  robbery score. The morning light of LA is beautiful, and could not have  been created in a closed set.
Only one thing lets it down - the romantic  scenes shot on De Niros balcony.  To me the night-time background looks  back projected, but I could be, and probably am wrong.  Either way, the  effect lets down the scene for me.

Anyone who doubts  the power of this on-screen romance need only watch the last scene between  the two characters, where they don't even speak a word.  A movie not only  about bank robbers and cops, but about life.",923356800,,862,4.5855263157894735
814816,4,6304214502,"Michael Mann is a recognized master of the action sequence.  What makes Heat tick is the supercharged scenes of gunplay and cat-and-mouse battle of the wits.  However, Heat only succeeds unconditionally on one of the two  fronts it tackles -- its successful treatment of phallocentric  (homoerotic?) matches of power only makes its clumsy treatment of love  themes all the more frustrating.
Amy Brenneman gets a role in which she  does little more than look good and look sad.  Diane Venora is even more  grievous; she plays the vulnerable (""stoned out on Prozac"")  mother/wife role with such vicious confidence that the character of Justine  ends up not deserving any sympathy at all.  Part of the fault, as well,  must lie in Mann's writing -- he just doesn't tend to come up with strong  or complex female characters.  ""I have to demean myself with Ralph  just to get closure with you?""  Give me a break.  Ashley Judd,  super-gifted as she is, salvages her role by giving it emotional resonance  touched with a splash of courage and spirit.
As for the Pacino-De Niro  pairing...De Niro wins hands down.  Though Pacino is wonderful in scenes  where Vincent Hanna shows his ""softer"" side, he overhams other  parts so much that after a while Vincent Hanna veers closer and closer to  being a caricature.  Not so De Niro's McCauley -- repressed but never  unfeeling, cool but never subzero.  High points also to Val Kilmer in a  tailor-made role that seems to echo what he did in Tombstone.
Overlength,  a hit-or-miss score by Elliot Goldenthal (superb during action scenes,  cliched and tiring during dramatic scenes) and too many subplots mar this  otherwise sweeping action saga.",922579200,,1681,4.938848920863309
814817,5,6304214502,"'Heat' is clearly one of the best movies of its genre.  I don't normally buy videos, but I bought this one after seeing the movie and thinking about it off and on for a number of months.
Sure, the action scenes are  no-holds-barred.
Pacino is, well, Pacino, good and bad.
DeNiro, well,  he's DeNiro!  This is the movie that made me a true fan of his, and his  quiet, sophisticated portrayal of Neil MacAuley is downright inspiring.
I have never contemplated a life of crime, but if there is one movie  that could make me think about it, this is it.  This is because Mann does  an excellent job of blurring the lines between the good and the bad guys,  and on more than one occasion, I found myself pulling for the  latter.
I've heard that in the pre-screenings they released two versions  with different endings.  In the unreleased version (which I would love to  see and own), the main bad-guy MacAuley (DeNiro) ends up killing Pacino's  Vincent Hanna.  I would have preferred this ending, if for no other reason  thant he fact that his character actually had much more to live for than  Pacino's.
Overall this is a fine movie and extremely enjoyable to watch.",921110400,,1161,4.558252427184466

Val Kilmer is peerless  and Al Pacino's personal battle with DeNiro pits two great stars against  each other.
Not as much gore as you might expect but relentless fun and  action.",920592000,,375,4.636363636363637
814819,4,6304214502,"When you first see this film, what really sticks in your mind are the action scenes. But repeated viewings reveal layer after layer of awesome character development. Women may find the ""damn the torpedos, full  speed ahead"" attitudes of Pacino and Deniro to be simple male  bullheadedness, but men will relate to their compulsions. The inner  workings of both the police department and the criminal gang are fully  fleshed out. Michael Mann proves himself once again to be one of the most  stylish directors in America. Watch this video in stereo, and feel your  room shake at the end during the airport showdown, as the planes take off  and land all around Pacino and Deniro! If you like this flick, also check  out the Mann-directed crime films ""Thief"" and  ""Manhunter"". But ""Heat"" is definitely his  masterpiece... so far. Only the murdered-hooker subplot seems superfluous.  By the way, ""Heat"" is a remake of Mann's T.V. movie from the late  80s,""L.A.Takedown""",920505600,,964,4.9937106918239

Well, i went to cinema again and i saw some movies i  liked, but i don`t even dare to compare the tension of ""usual  suspects"" or the gunfights of ""LA confidential"" with  ""heat"", because it would remind me, how poor those other movies  realy are.

7865470,3,6304214502,The movie itself is top notch with two iconic actors in Pacino and DeNiro. The huge dissapointment was the quality and sound of the Blu-ray. Being blu-ray I was expecting a much better picture.  The audio was even worse with me having to raise the volume way up just to hear it loud.  For whatever reason my surround sound which is very high quality could not get much or any sound in the rear speakers. The DVD version is actually better especially the audio.  But paying only 8 dollars for the Blu ray I figure they cut back on making it high quality and it clearly shows it.,1524355200,,577,4.324074074074074
