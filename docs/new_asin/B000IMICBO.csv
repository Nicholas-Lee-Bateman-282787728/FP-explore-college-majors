It is interesting to listen to their accounts of how life was at the start of taming the Matanuska Valley for farming.  It was a hard life, but they managed,  I have have met quite a few of the remaining farmers and their families.  What a fantastic story they all have to tell.  So interesting to listen to them tell their tales.  Would recommend this if you are a history buff and want to know more about the Matanuska Valley farmers.",1381276800,,595,4.363636363636363

This gives great interviews with the ""Colonists"" but is a little long to view in one setting as it kind of drags on. Informative but the other DVD is more important as it is a ""Movie"" of the actual event. Our families preceeded the ""Colonists"" and were the original ""Settlers"" about 20+ years prior and even we learned some things we didn't know. A true adventure.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alaska-Far-Away-The-New-Deal-Pioneers-of-the-Matanuska-Colony/dp/0802611230/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alaska Far Away: The New Deal Pioneers of the Matanuska Colony</a>",1310688000,,661,6.438202247191011

My family arrived in Alaska around the same time as the people in the DVD so it was great to hear the old timers talk about the colony days. It is nice to learn a bit more about where you are from. It certainly shows what early Alaska was like for those arriving in the 1930's from their own point of view through interviews taken throughout the 1990's to the 2000's when the project was completed.

I think you have to be interested in the History of Alaska or the History of New Deal people to get the most out of this. There is a lot of information in the DVDs about this particular place and time in Alaskan history. And there is a lot of stories to listen to, the makers have done a good job in saving the stories of these people before it is too late. It shows the New Deal that was given to these families during the Great Depression as well as the impact their arrival had on the locals already living in the area.

Can't wait to get their movie ""Alaska Far Away"" on DVD!",1210204800,4,1026,4.125
