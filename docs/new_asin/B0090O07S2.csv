5212250,5,B0090O07S2,"Now THIS is the way to release a classic concert....
1) you retrieve all the existing elements and songs
2) you get a modern crew to edit the footage and clean up the sound
3) you present it in brilliant widescreen!

AND... in the value for money department
bonus feature ""Echoes Of the Bowl"" on the history of the Hollywood Bowl and the Doors talking about playing there
bonus feature about the event itself from the participants not only the Doors but the Chambers Brothers who opened
another bonus feature ""Reworking the Doors"" talking about the technical achievement in fixing the old sound and video etc..
and BONUS performances from TV shows as well as a music video....

This is just a brilliant way to bring a treasure from the glorious 60's Rock Icons back to life in all the best ways... heck just the concert redone would have been enough but all the bonus features are something we used to only get for something like Gone With the Wind or The Wizard of Oz....I'm very happy to have this, and it is easily one of my more cherished concert videos. I will revisit this over and over again... If you are a fan of The Doors this should be a NO Brainer!!",1350777600,49,1161,4.446009389671362
5212251,5,B0090O07S2,This is a great review I have the other Hollywood bowl and didn't plan to get this one but I have changed my mind I feel this is going to be better than I thought. Because of this review I will be purchasing this latest version.,1350777600,,228,3.9782608695652173
5212252,5,B0090O07S2,"When The Doors were planning what to do for the Hollywood Bowl show in 1968 Ray Manzarek floated out the idea of coming out in Kabuki masks and Japanese robes. Alternatively, Jim Morrison, who was already showing the disillusionment of being a rock star, said ""just give me my microphone, and do whatever you want to do."" Maybe if Morrison had been more receptive to the idea and they had gone through with it, the costumes would have distracted them from giving one of the best concerts of their career, and it was filmed.

""Live at the Bowl `68"" shows The Doors at the height of their musical prowess and their career. The summer before ""Light My Fire"" had made The Doors a nationally known act when it hit number one on Billboard's charts. Later in July of 1968 ""Hello, I Love You"" would do the same, and in September of 1968 they flew to Europe on what would become their one European tour. The Hollywood Bowl show was to be a celebration of The Doors and it was a hometown audience for the band, as well as the prestige of playing at the Hollywood Bowl. Before the show The Doors met and had dinner with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, both of whom attended the Hollywood Bowl show with Pam reportedly sitting on Jagger's lap during the show. That spring The Doors had started filming the shows that would become ""Feast of Friends"" so they decided to film the Hollywood Bowl show. If all that wasn't enough pressure, Morrison took a hit of acid before going on.

""Live at the Bowl `68""  reveals the stark theatre of The Doors, Morrison prowling the stage, the rat-a-tat-tat of John Densmore's drums, Manzarek's apparent joy as he played, and Doors guitarist Robby Krieger wandering the stage like a lost troubadour. The Hollywood Bowl was an atypical Doors show in a couple of ways, one that they rehearsed prior to the show, and the second was The Doors had a setlist for the show and stuck to it! Something they rarely did. The deconstruction of ""Celebration of the Lizard"" that had poetic segues into the more traditional songs such as ""Light My Fire"" creates a jarring, disconcerting and theatrical effect. Morrison demonstrates his command of an audience, highlighted during ""The End"" when he goofs on a grasshopper he sees onstage and creates the impromtu ""Ode to a Grasshopper."" When he realizes it's a moth says ""uh-oh, I blew it, it's a moth"" and gets a laugh, but he pulls everyone back into the tension and drama of the song.

Then there's the reason for the release of this DVD, the restored three songs ""Hello, I Love You,"" ""The Wasp (Texas Radio and the Big Beat),"" and ""Spanish Caravan,"" finally make this show complete. The show was remastered and digitally transferred. The color has also been restored. You can see the green of the carpeting The Doors were playing on and Jim Morrison's face doesn't turn purple or look fuzzy as it does on ""The Doors Live at the Hollywood Bowl."" The restoration lives up to the claims on the promotional materials that it `feels like you're on stage with the band.'

Something else that is unusual for The Doors is the DVD contains many bonus features, including ""Echoes From the Bowl,"" a brief history of the Hollywood Bowl, and includes The Doors history leading to the show at the bowl. ""You Had to Be There"" The Doors members' reminiscences of the show, and ""Reworking The Doors"" in which Bruce Botnick tells how he remastered the film and audio to give as close to a pristine Doors performance as possible. Also included is the 1984 music video of The Doors cover of ""Gloria,"" and their TV show appearances on the Smothers Brothers Show and Jonathon Winters show.

If you already have ""The Doors Live at the Hollywood Bowl"" and you're wondering if you need ""Live at the Bowl `68"", consider the improved quality of the sound and the film, the restoration of the previously missing songs, and the inclusion of many bonus features. It's a package that you will find you need for your collection.

I've read accounts of Jim wandering the streets of Holland taking any pill anyone offered. Of the times Ray had to and sing because Jim had left the building. And, sadly, Jim died so young. But it is what it is, and it was what it was. Morrison is so stoned it looked like he was ready to hurl. Still, the first half hour, forty-five minutes were fantastic. Things went downhill from there. The band barely holding things together. If you were hoping for some nicely edited, studio take, look elsewhere.

5212301,5,B0090O07S2,"This DVD is essential for any Doors fan. Even casual fans should buy it as it may well inspire them to investigate the bands music further. The restoration of the film of the Doors 1968 Hollywood Bowl concert is a triumph of modern technology and a credit to the original cinematographers. The video and audio is now so good that the concert could have been filmed last week. The process of restoration is covered in detail in one of the excellent Extra features on this DVD. The mini-documentaries are well worth watching and there are some bonus television performances included.

The concert itself shows the band at their peak in a live setting. At the time much of their best music was still to come, particularly the albums Morrison Hotel and L.A. Woman, but this performance is a good representation of their work up until this point. Later in their career live performances would become often shambolic and unpredictable as Jims erratic behaviour took increasing hold over him, and the band. This performance is tight and professional. The richness of their music works well in the live setting where their improvisation and extended versions of songs are developed and explored musically and lyrically. The impression we get watching is of a well-rehearsed band with an intuitive understanding of where each song is going.

The concert takes you back to a time when bands just came on stage and played. Unlike the garish and tacky antics of some modern performers, the Doors grab you and hold you with musicianship and the power of their music. There is not much theatricality, except in The End and The Unknown Soldier. Jim is the brooding presence youd expect, but with boyish smiles and charm, he is also an engaging frontman, and expressive vocalist. Robby is never less than tasteful and astute in his playing. Like the others, he makes it look easy, until, in one of my favourite shots, we see him close up, breath condensing in the cold night air, sweat pouring down his face. Laid back, but intense. Ray is perpetually smiling, hunched over his keyboards with his head cocked sideways, absorbed in the music, playing brilliantly, giving the band so much of their unique sound. The revelation for me was John Densmore. His work is powerful and expressive, subtle and complex. He is easily the equal of any rock drummer, including Baker, Bonham or Moon (and considerably more sane!)

Great concert, but I was saddened when it finished. Ahead lay trouble with the law, controversy, and for Jim, decline, and a squalid death three years later. That we know how the story ends makes this wonderful concert also quite poignant.",1424304000,3,2638,4.870824053452115
5212302,4,B0090O07S2,"It's the only full live concert in the US The Doors performed that was recorded. It's such a shame that their other concerts weren't recorded, because this concert is like drinking soda that has been open for a week, it's flat. Don't get me wrong the song quality is amazing, and the concert is said to be there best quality music they ever did. But still, I would of loved to see Jim drunk onstage cursing at the audience and letting loose. The concert is very tame, but it's still an excellent showcase filled with some of the Doors best songs.",1423526400,,546,4.415841584158416

5212323,4,B0090O07S2,"This was my first concert, and I was permitted to go with friends, and without parents. I wasn't familiar with the opening band (Steppenwolf, just before the release of ""Born to be Wild""), and was excited to see and hear the Chambers Brothers. The Doors, of course, were the key attraction. The set list was terrific, a great overview of their work to that point (just prior to ""Waiting for the Sun""), Jim Morrison was in great voice, and the band played very well behind him. The only negative, but a substantial one, is that The Doors thrived on mystery and tension. It is not possible, in my experience, to generate those sensations on a lovely summer evening at the Bowl. The crowd was mellow and reasonably stoned, and a fair number of people seemed to be there for the scene or whatever, to Morrison's periodic annoyance. Still, it looks and sounds great, particularly for 1968, and it's a terrific document.",1389657600,4,914,4.683229813664596
5212324,5,B0090O07S2,I sure wish that I had been. But this blu-ray (which has a very beautiful picture and sound) is the closest thing to actually hopping in a time machine and going there. A stellar performance by The Doors that will leave you in awe of their greatness. Recommend to anyone interested in the best classic rock band.,1388534400,,312,4.491228070175438
5212325,5,B0090O07S2,"Great DVD. Jim Morrison looked so young. I guess when I originally saw him perform on the Ed Sullivan Show I was that young too so I didn't notice. The man was a poet and a great natural performer. He instinctively knew how to connect with the audience and draw them into his world which was amazing. There hasn't been anyone like him since and I seriously doubt there ever will.

5212328,4,B0090O07S2,"A lot of time and energy has gone into this excellent digital restoration of ""Live at the Bowl '68"". An impressive achievement. And as I've commented before, in previous posts on this page, I was one of the cameramen that night, on stage filming Jim with a 16 mm Arriflex 16BL hand held camera.

I see in the Product Information section on Amazon's ""Live at the Bowl '68"" page, the Director is listed as...The Doors. Well,  the cameramen and the overall film shoot that night was directed by Paul Ferrara. Paul was a classmate of Ray and Jim at UCLA Film School, as I also was, as well as most members of the film crew that night. Paul was working for the Doors, directing the shooting of footage for what would become the film, ""Feast of Friends"". The Hollywood Bowl concert was originally shot for inclusion of some of the footage in ""Feast of Friends"". And the last sequence of that film is The Doors' performance of ""The End"" that night at the Bowl. Paul Farrara was also the cinematographer on Jim's film, ""HYWAY"", or ""HWY"". Which Paul shot in gorgeous 35 mm  wide screen Eastman Color (I saw the only 35 mm Eastman Color release print a couple of times, in 1970) . ""HWY"" seems to have fallen into one of those copyright/ownership black holes, but, of course,  inferior bootleg versions have been posted on You Tube (as have re-edited and re-scored versions of ""Feast of Friends""). Hopefully, some day a digital transfer from the original 35 mm Eastman Color negative (wherever that cut negative is) will someday be available on what will be a visually stunning Blu-ray. Sequences from HWY can be seen in the documentary ""When You're Strange"", also available from Amazon. At some time in the early 1970's, Paul sold his percentage of the ""Feast of Friends"" film, all the footage shot as well as the finished film, back to the Doors. Which I guess gives them the right to put their name on the Hollywood Bowl concert as...The Director.

The Doors' Hollywood Bowl concert is a very good concert. But, the best Doors concert I ever experienced in, a larger venue, was about 2 months later, at the Roundhouse in North London. The Doors played Friday and Saturday nights at the Roundhouse, on a double bill with The Jefferson Airplane. The Doors opened on Friday night, followed by the Airplane. Then The Doors did a second set, and the Airplane closed the show. On Saturday night the Airplane opened, then the Doors, then the Airplane and then the Doors closed the show. The Doors came on very early in the AM of Sunday, after the Underground had stopped running at 11:00 PM. Almost the entire audience stayed, and the Doors played until dawn, and the opening of the Underground on Sunday morning.  That second Doors performance on Saturday night is the very best Doors performance I've ever seen, outside of a club. That performance truly lived up to all the hype of a Doors performance being a shamanistic journey. Unfortunately, it's only available as a DVD transfer from a grainy 16 mm film shot and made by British TV. Not even the complete first Friday night performance. Most likely also available from Amazon.

The best Doors' club performance I ever experienced was also the most powerful Doors-performance-as-shamanistic- journey I ever experienced. Which was at the old Ciro's nightclub, on the Sunset Strip, in a concert presented by Kaleidoscope, in Spring 1967. I wish that performance had been filmed, or video taped!",1381968000,6,3433,4.75

existed. Just the first song, 'When the music's over' it's worth buying this DVD. They build their
sound just from the high pitched organ and bass, drums, and then WHAMO Mr. Jim Morrison
comes in with cutting guitar and it becomes magic. This should be studied buy anyone wanting
to see real star power in show and the music business. I think I'm going to go watch it again.

When I read that they re-stored the microphones carefully, restoring at least 2 songs I had to get it. ""Hello, I love you,"" and ""Unknown Soldier"" both come alive with greater power than other live versions. No one could touch the band, and nobody could top Jim Morrison's theatricality in full, improvisational force. Every reason for taking a literature class, especially poetry gets full credence. You are transfixed as Jim prowls his improvisational licks without missing a beat, seamlessly moving into another killer song like ""Unknown Soldier,"" which surpasses the excitement of the black-and-white European tour version. The Bonus Features make it more than collectible featuring: a wonderful final interview with the surviving members recollecting that time and their place in it, just a wonderful thanks to their fans. Live cuts from The Smothers Brothers Show, the Jonathan Winters Show, make this concert a wonderful Thank You package. The Doors deserve a wonderful ovation for this captured moment at The Bowl.",1364428800,,1307,5.140845070422535

When I play the disc in my Sony blu ray, which is connected to an LG TV that is connected to an LG sound bar, it starts out fine.  I have music on the menu screen, audio with the extras, but when I play the concert, there is no audio.  If I turn off the sound bar and turn on the TV speakers, we then have sound.  I called LG, who told me to call Sony, who tried to help me, but to no avail.  I've updated the blu ray firmware, but still no audio.  I gave the disc to my brother to try it on his set up.  Worked fine.  We have played many movies, and we've played other concert discs, and had no problems.  It's just a problem with this disc, and only a problem with the concert footage.

5212357,3,B0090O07S2,"If you're a fan of the doors, this is obviously essential.

But if you are a general concert film buff who appreciates high quality Blu-Ray releases, this particular Blu-Ray is very problematic. I can only presume the problem comes from the source material, which I assume was shot in 16mm. 16mm productions provide challenges for blu-ray producers because the film grain becomes so dramatically evident. So some producers have taken to using a process that blurs the grain while retaining the edge clarity of elements in the video. Done very subtly, this can improved the appearance of a film without becoming obvious or distracting.

Done poorly--as with Doors Live at the Hollywood Bowl--it becomes a case a what is known as grain rape; a crime against the original aesthetic of the footage.

Particularly in long shots the band look like a moving oil painting. I haven't seen the DVD version but it simply HAS to be better than this thing.

The gold standards for concert footage clarity is clearly Queen Rock Montreal, and other productions like AC/DC live in Donington. But not all bands could afford 35mm I guess. So to me there's no need to destroy the image in an effort to ""make it better"" just because it was shot in 16mm.

But beyond that, it sounds pretty terrific; which a mix emphasizing a ""concert sound"" and echo, and very unadventurous camera work (which is actually a really really good thing). Mostly just straight on shots of the full band with occasional close ups.",1361664000,7,1487,4.815686274509804

JM is at his theatrical best, especially in Unknown Soldier.  Consider the context.  Nothing like this existed back then.  I was highly entertained and I have watched this show repeatedly.

5212367,5,B0090O07S2,"Almost 45 years later, we have now a restoration of that legendary concert  in Hollywood  Bowl from July 5, 1968. The result are quiet surprising in this Blu-Ray with no grainy spots in the picture and some nice black levels. But the main treat is the DTS surround mix that let you hear the guitar of Mr. Krieger circulating in the speakers. Naturally the picture of a old show can't be as sharp as a new concert, but they did a nice restoration of the picture and especially the sound, because in some songs, were missing the sound of Jim's voice on the original tape. These details are fully explained in the excellent documentary in the extras.

Seeing the young Jim Morrison clearly affected by LSD is kind of strange, but he managed to start the show with control, but as the show progress, he tend to extend the notes longer, his mind starting to slow down a bit, but it didn't affected the music that much.

This is a complete show even at  72 minutes long. It goes in a flash when you feel immersed in the music of this original classic rock band that developed  a original sound with a unique singer that add poetry to his singing. It's only sad that he died a few years later, because the band could have made a lot more music, who knows.",1357516800,,1248,4.357758620689655

5212376,3,B0090O07S2,"This brief 71 minute concert is said to be the best The Doors ever recorded.  I never actually saw them live but certainly remember the directional change they and others had on modern music.  The producers of the Blu ray transfer that I watched should be commended for their efforts to resurrect this filmed version.  The original film was directed by keyboard player Ray Manzarek.

Aside from an unusual amount of shots from ""right field"" the overall work is decent.  The audio work was very good.  The audio engineer in 1968 was Bruce Botnick who also did the mix and restoration work on this disc.  Botnick notes in his booklet notes that lead singer Jim Morrison had dropped acid just before going on.  I suspect that wasn't the only thing he had been ingesting.

Frankly his performance was pretty poor.  He spends a lot of time dancing around the stage, while his band mates play the same refrain over and over, waiting for him to return.  On one song he nearly nods off standing at the mic before screaming ""wake up.""  I don't think that was aimed at the audience.  Guitarist Robby Krieger also appears high, floating around Morrison with mostly background strumming.  His one brief solo is good not great.

John Densmore on drums and Manzarek carried this concert and I suspect the band, at least on this night.  Densmore didn't seem to miss a beat and certainly had a bead on Morrison.  The more I listen and look at this band, I tend to give more and more credit to Manzarek.  As the keyboard player and without a bass player in the band, Manzarek handles the beat on the lower octaves as well as alternate as the lead instrument with Krieger.  I suspect everybody was stoned but Manzarek had that little grin on his face, suggesting ""I can't believe we're playing the Hollywood Bowl.""  This was a big deal at the time.

While my comments suggest I didn't like this concert, I did.  I just think it could have been better with a more coherent Morrison.  For me the best songs came midway through with ""Moonlight Drive,"" ""Horse Latitudes,""  ""A Little Game,"" ""The Hill Dwellers"" and ""Spanish Caravan.""

It is evident that this aging film required some serious video noise reduction.  Even so, the clarity is less than great, especially on the many distant shots.  There is new material added to the original version and some of it was edited out for a reason.  Certainly on the mid-range and close-ups the picture is very good.  The transfer is in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option as well as LPCM stereo.  I only listened to the 5.1 and it is excellent.  Certain audio segments were in fact lost on some of the songs and were recreated using other concerts.  If you watch closely you can see some synch issues, but they are barely noticeable and not a big deal.  In general the audio track is clear and authentic.

Here are the added bonus features which add about an hour to the disc (HD and SD):

Hardcore fans have seen all the footage over the last few decades, but not like this.  Plus, there is some bonus material with Bruce Botnik talking about the technical details.  I highly recommend this DVD for your collection.",1355184000,,340,4.793103448275862
5212381,4,B0090O07S2,The Doors live on bluray. Nice. Remember this is 45 years old. Sound  is amazing. I nice trip down memory lane. Great to hear and see Morrison sing. Nice piece on the history of the bowl too,1355184000,3,190,4.135135135135135

5212383,5,B0090O07S2,"There has been very little decent live video/adio of the Doors until now. I had a VHS copy of this concert obtained about 12 years ago. The new DVD, remastered for both sound and video, is incredible. This will make you feel like you've seen the Doors play live....at their Prime. I shouldn't say this, but they could have charged $100 and it would still be well worth it. This is a great deal and one you will truly enjoy. Enjoy!",1354752000,,430,4.320987654320987
5212384,5,B0090O07S2,One of the greatest bands. One of the greatest performances. And in high-definition. What else can anybody want? Every fan of classic rock n' roll should have a copie of this.,1354492800,,175,4.67741935483871

5212386,1,B0090O07S2,"Oh My!  I just watched this.  Words cannot reproduce the feeling of let down I have over this show.  While the audio is excellent, and the picture pefect, the performance is a joke.  They are obviously on a powerful illegal substance and not taking the show all that seriously.  I can appreciate that this was 1968 after all, and it was a rock band, but I expected something I would enjoy.  I didn't enjoy this.  Anyways, I watched the music videos and tv performances as well, and while interesting, the sound was presented in 48k and 16 bits.  Not much more than cd quality.  I bought this mainly because it was 96k 24 bits, and it was the doors.  While fantastically produced, the subject matter falls a bit short for my taste.  Sorry guys...  Flame away!",1354060800,7,758,4.492647058823529
5212387,5,B0090O07S2,"I remember the melodic sounds of the doors and just had to hear more when their stuff would be played on the radio.  I was too young to be at a doors concert and this intimate look at them in concert is worth every penny.  Sure, Jim is taking a ride but once you get used to this and really listen to the music you get it.
I watched it three times and felt something profound each time.
They include footage of the band playing a more raw small-town concert that feels like it could be in any high school anywhere and you can see them play clean and sober and fall for them.
To me, Jim looks like a medicated rabbit that knows he may not be pleasing everyone but he showed up to let us see a glimpse of Jim--a glimpse at his soul.  -t.f.",1353974400,,737,4.0
5212388,2,B0090O07S2,"The doors are one of my favorite groups. I was disappointed I never got to go to this concert. Not disappointed anymore, the doors in concert are boring. Also disappointed in the quality of Blu-ray on the older concerts.",1353715200,,220,4.666666666666667

Jim Morrison are close up & they are perfection! The music, and especially the vocals

Now because of clever editing and a lot of hours of hard work, all the songs from the show are included and it looks amazing.

It's a worthwhile purchase even if you have the old version, I'm sure you'll be pleased with it.",1352764800,5,346,4.149253731343284

I love hearing complete high quality live versions of Spanish Caravan and Hello I Love You. The picture and sound have been improved by so much you might as well throw your old copy away. Hats off to The Doors and all involved on this now definitive DOORS show.,1352073600,7,425,4.195121951219512
5212395,2,B0090O07S2,"There is something wrong with this disc, and the one I sent back for which this is a replacement.
Same thing again: skipping and freezing in various spots, the exact same spots in fact. A small pit in the disc surface about 7/16"" from the outer
edge can be seen in both the discs I had. There was a problem in the manufacturing (duplicating) process, and perhaps Amazon
has a vast batch of these bad clones. Customers beware. No, it's not my player. I have three Blueray players from different manufacturers, and I have tried all of them. I don't know what I will do yet...",1351987200,6,573,4.415094339622642
5212396,5,B0090O07S2,"I finally watched this new version and recently saw the one with a complaint of old version and must say that even if it has been altered in some formatting that hardly a real issue to how the whole video done. A much better print then the original DVD that was out. How they made the lost tracks fit was a marvel. It almost seems to me they used the Hollywood Bowl audio from the tapes they got from ""Absolutely Live"" but states otherwise, nevertheless, this one is worth picking up if your just wondering what The Doors were like ""Live"" or the collector wanting a better complete concert. The bonus material with members are really good as well. A history of the Bowl (which I have been to and it is a great venue for a concert) & the way the added songs were put into the DVD. So in conclusion, get this one, keep the other if you want to which they cut out the fireworks in this version & enjoy The Doors in the peak of their career. Highly recommended, get it!

5212397,5,B0090O07S2,"Watching this concert gives you a front row seat to one fantastic concert. The restoration of the original film was beautifully done and the sound was crisp and clear. You really feel like you were put in a time capsule and whooshed back in time to 1968. For any fan of The Doors or someone wanting to learn more about them, this is a must watch. The band looked and sounded great - no fireworks, laser light shows or fog needed here. The Doors talent shines and Jim Morrison is as mesmerizing as ever! The extras on the dvd are stunning tv performances which alone are worth it. I can't wait to see this in the movie theatre - don't miss this one - there will never be anyone like Jim Morrison and in watching this, makes you miss him even more.",1351555200,8,746,4.26056338028169

The Blu-ray even comes with A BOOK! Yeah. Not a huge book, but a little booklet with story, credits, etc. Well worth the money, and an absolute necessity for anyone's Doors collection.",1351555200,10,429,4.958333333333333
5212399,3,B0090O07S2,"The sound is amazing, but I'm surprised no one has mentioned that the video is cropped.  The concert was originally filmed 1:33 full frame, and there has been some cropping to get it to fill the 1:85 widescreen frame.  Very annoying!  Ray does mention that they did some digital work on it so that it wasn't stretched out (like when someone plays a full screen video in widescreen, it gets squished so it fills the frame), but if you compare some shots, they definitely cropped it somewhat.",1351468800,12,490,4.609195402298851

Visually, sonically, musically, this is an absolutely amazing concert. I don't care if you're just a casual Doors fan, or a devout Doors fan, you must buy this film. It will bring you right back to 1968, as if you were in the front row, experiencing the Doors at their absolute best. This is truly an amazing concert, beautifully filmed, with state-of-the-art sound, and the band at their best. Truly amazing. If I could give it more than five stars, I would.",1351296000,5,569,4.480769230769231

5212403,5,B0090O07S2,"If you're into classic rock, then who doesn't appreciate - if not love - The Doors and their contribution to the soundtrack of our youth?  Their music is still burned into our minds and their live performances are the stuff of legend.  To that point, The Doors supplied plenty of post-Independence Day fireworks on July 5, 1968 when the legendary quartet played the Hollywood Bowl, a concert that is considered to be the band's finest on film. For the first time, the film from the historic performance has been painstakingly restored using the original camera negatives and the audio has been remixed and mastered from original multi-tracks by the group's engineer Bruce Botnick. This new restoration offers a stunning visual upgrade from earlier versions and will give fans the closest experience to being there live alongside Jim Morrison, John Densmore, Robby Krieger and Ray Manzarek, who opined, ""You can hear it as if you were at the Hollywood Bowl, on stage with us.""

LIVE AT THE BOWL '68 will include three previously unreleased tracks from the performance. Technical issues with the recording of ""Hello, I Love You,"" ""The WASP (Texas Radio And The Big Beat),"" and ""Spanish Caravan"" prevented them from being released in the past. Now, through meticulous restoration of the audio, all three will be included, marking the first time the concert has been available in its entirety.

The DVD, Blu-Ray and digital video each feature a 16x9 high-definition digital transfer with both a stereo and 5.1 audio soundtrack as well as over an hour of bonus material. Included in the additional content are Echoes From The Bowl, The Doors' route to the Hollywood Bowl; You Had To Be There, memories of The Doors' performance at the Bowl; Reworking The Doors, an in-depth look at how the film was restored; and three bonus performances: Wild Child from The Smothers Brothers Show in 1968, Light My Fire from The Jonathan Winters Show in December 1967 and a version of Van Morrison's Gloria with specially created visuals.

Jeff Jampol, Doors manager and producer of the film said ""The Doors' live performances were a shamanistic journey into dark rock and roll psychedelic theater - a swirling mixture of rock `n' roll heat, poetry, danger, drama and unbridled musical virtuosity. Captured at the height of The Doors' magical powers, in one of the world's greatest venues, this brand new restoration, edit and mix, corny as it may sound, made me fall in love a hundred times, all over again.""

Geoff Kempin, executive producer for Eagle Rock said ""The Doors were one of THE most incredible live bands ever - we wanted to apply the top technology so that everyone can fully appreciate the phenomenon of The Doors captured at their height on 5 July 1968"".

In addition to Doors fans, music and pop culture historians will definitely want to own their own copy of this masterful restoration of this historic performance by one of rock's iconic bands: The Doors

As a keyboard player myself, I have nothing but respect for Manzarek but he could have cut the intro in half. Morrison is spot on despite apparently doing Acid before the show. Maybe he should have done it for more live performances (okay, I'm kidding) because he nails the vocals and doesn't go as crazy as usual.",1515974400,,431,4.538461538461538
