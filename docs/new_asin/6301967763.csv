398973,3,6301967763,"1935 was the year Clark Gable was out to sea. The oscar winning film ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" was also released and boy does it make this one look pale. Though I suppose it's not fair to compare them, since, they are completely different movies.
 ""China Seas"" was directed by Tay Garnett (director of many TV shows and the 1946 film version of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"")and has an incrediable cast consisting of Gable, Jean Harlow, Wallace Berry, Rosalind Russell (at first I didn't even recognize her), and one of my favorites Robert Benchley. But despite the presence of a talented cast ""China Seas"" never quite takes sail. The movie has Gable playing Capt. Alan Gaskell and a voyage being made from Hong Kong to Singapore, aboard the ship is 100 pounds of bullion, but, unknown to Gable, someone on the ship plans to steal it. Wallace Berry plans a friend Jamesy MacRdie who has a crush on Gable's girl (?) Dolly Portland (AKA ""China Doll) played by Jean Harlow. To further complicate things we have an old flame of Gable's, Sybill Barclay (Rosalind Russell) and a writer looking for material for his new book, but never has time to write a word, since he's constantly seeking inspiration from the old bottle (Robert Benchley).
 On paper ""China Seas"" seems like a good movie. And if your a fan of classic films from Hollywood's ""Golden Era"" you would think the cast might pull it off, but, the screenplay has too many problems, which was based on a novel written by Crosbie Garstin. The movie never clearly identifies the relationship between Gable and Harlow or the past relationship between Gable and Russell. We are never quite sure where everyone stands. Also, as much as I enjoy watching Benchley, to be honest he serve no purpose in this movie. His scenes make a few comedis attempts but seem out of place in this movie. His character was just not needed. And if it appears in the novel, I'm guessing it was written differently.
 Despite the all-star cast, it's Lewis Stone (probably best known for appearing in the Andy Hardy series and films such as ""Grand Hotel"") who comes out looking best. He just seems to blend in with the scenery. Granted most people will keep their eyes on Gable and Harlow, but Stone's performance is far more subtle. It's a co-starring role but there were times I had sympathy for his character and other times I hated him. It was a very good role for him.
 Most people who watch this movie will enjoy it. Since it's not exactly a popular film, only those who appreciate older films will be watching. Fun light movie, but not what it could have been.
 Bottom-line: Entertaining adventure on the high seas with some good performances, Stone's being the best. Has a weak script but older fans will look past it and have fun watching it.",1075248000,5,2776,4.6571428571428575

A fairly entertaining romantic adventure with Gable having to deal with the dumb blonde Jean Harlow. She's very sexy here, and this mov helped to create the myth. Also starring Wallace Beery as the bad guy, Rosalind Russel as the old Gable's sweetheart, and a nice little performance by Lewis Stone.

Produced by Irving Thalberg, Albert Lewin
Written by Crobie Garstin (book) James Kevin, McGuinness, Jules Furthman
Starring: Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Wallace Beery, Lewis Stone, Rosalind Russell, Robert Benchley
Music by Herbert Stothart
Cinematography Ray June, Clyde De Vinna (2nd unit}
Editing by William LeVanway.

Adventure film starring Clark Gable as a brave sea captain, Jean Harlow as his brassy paramour, and Wallace Beery as an extremely suspicious-looking character. The oceangoing epic also features Lewis Stone and Rosalind Russell, while humorist Robert Benchley memorably portrays a character reeling drunk from one end of the film to the other.
Clark Gable's several temper tantrums on the set were tolerated by MGM studio chief Louis B Mayer because the star had recently won an Oscar in It Happened One Night (1934) on a loan-out to Columbia Pictures, and he did not want to risk losing him. Mayer even tolerated that Gable risked his life by refusing a stunt double in a sequence in which he assisted numerous Chinese extras in roping in a runaway steamroller that crashed up and down the decks of the cantilevered studio ship.
 Clark Gable and Jean Harlow had worked together as supporting players four years earlier in the Wallace Beery vehicle The Secret Six, and Beery and Gable both starred later that same year in Hell Divers. Wallace Beery had received top billing in both Pre-Code films. (text so far mostly Wikipedia).

The Wikipedia review I am quoting is not only well written, buy also absolutly to the point: The lavish MGM epic is a first class screwball comedy, in the top of its field like Frank Capra - view and review!

Wallace Berry plays the slimy villian that has a soft spot for Harlow.  There is a terrific scene between the two where he shoves her and threatens her and you really see the struggle and her desire to do the right thing at war with her fear.  She was very underated as an actress and holds her own with all the pros.  Rosiland Russell gives an excellent performance and nails a British accent.

Directed by Tay Garnett

Dynamic Alan Gaskell (Clark Gable) captains a ship bound from Hong Kong to Singapore. Gaskell tries to turn over a new leaf from his hard-drinking lifestyle after becoming attached to a refined high class English lady, Sybil Barclay (Rosalind Russell). His former girlfriend Dolly (Jean Harlow) is extremely jealous of the budding relationship and tries hard to get the Captain back. He is unimpressed with her loud, obnoxious, and uncivilized manners, even though she is extremely beautiful. Wallace First Mate, Jamesy MacArdle (Wallace Beery) is in league with a gang of pirates who plan to steal the gold shipment being carried in the hold of the steamer. Dolly tumbles to MacArdle's secret, but is unable to convince Gaskell.

Based on a novel by Crosbie Garstin.  Action/adventure director and South Seas enthusiast Tay Garnet - A great adventure story told with verve by an outstanding cast in top form!

China Seas proved that the recently imposed Hollywood production code had little if any effect on the popularity of MGM sex symbols Clark Gable and Jean Harlow.

399125,4,6301967763,"""China Seas"" stars MGM's 3 top stars (Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, and Wallace Beery) in an exotic adventure tale produced by Irving Thalberg with a score by Herbert Stothart.

The pairing of these 3 stars was an enormous box office draw. All 3 had top 10 films the previous year (Beery in ""Viva Villa"", Gable in ""It Happened One Night"" and Harlow in ""The Girl from Missouri"") and in 1933 Harlow teamed with Gable in ""Hold Your Man"" (1933) and with Beery in ""Dinner at Eight"" and both films were in the top 10. In fact, from 1932 through 1935 these 3 actors appeared in the top 10 every year without fail.

Of course, Gable + Harlow were already a tremendous draw. They did 6 films together, starting in 1931 with ""The Secret Six"". Their second film in 1932, ""Red Dust"", cemented Gable's rising stardom. That film was #4 at the box office and ""Hold Your Man"" was #7 in 1933. ""China Seas"" came in #6 in 1935. The next year, ""Wife vs. Secretary"" was #10 at the box office and the following year ""Saratoga"" was #2, beaten out by ""Snow White"". So, with the exception of their first film, 5 of their next 5 films all made the Top 10 box office.

BTW - Their first film, ""The Secret Six"", starred Wallace Beery and the co-stars were Lewis Stone and Johnny Mack Brown (the cowboy star). Harlow received 4th billing and poor Clark Gable's name was way down the list. By 1935, Gable got top billing and Beery had fallen to third; Lewis Stone went from co-star to also ran. Such are the vicissitudes of a Hollywood career.

Clark Gable (1901-60) was one of the biggest stars of the 20th century, and a pretty good actor to boot. We remember him best as Rhett Butler for ""GWTW"" (1939), for which he received one of his three Oscar nominations (the other nomination was for 1935's ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and he won in 1934 for ""It Happened One Night""), but he gave us many memorable performances in films like ""Teachers' Pet"" (1958) and ""But Not for Me"" (1959) both of which earned him Golden Globe nominations. My favorite Gable flick is ""Run Silent Run Deep"" (1958). Gable plays a sea captain with a checkered past.

Jean Harlow (1911-37) plays Gable's girl friend.  Harlow was the biggest sex symbol of her times having specialized in playing the gangster's moll in such films as ""Hell's Angels"" (1930), ""The Secret Six"" (1931), and ""Public Enemy"" (1931). She evolved as an actress, exploring different personas, such as the comedienne (""Bombshell""), the brassy girl friend (""Red Dust""), and the girl next door (""Wife vs. Secretary""). Here she reverts to the brassy slightly risqu girl friend she was most famous for.

In 1935 Wallace Beery (1885-1949) was at the height of his popularity, having starred in the popular ""Min and Bill"" (1930) and ""The Big House"" (1930) and won the Oscar for ""The Champ"" (1931). He co-starred in one of the first blockbusters ever made, ""Grand Hotel"" (1932). In 1934 he played Long John Silver in ""Treasure Island"" and Pancho Villa in ""Viva Villa"" - two of the biggest hits of the year. In this film Beery plays a shady character who is in love with Harlow.

Rosalind Russell (1907-76) plays a sophisticated English woman who knew Gable ""in the old days"" when he was a proper gentleman and when she was married to his best friend. Now a widow, Russell has tracked Gable down and hopes to light the flame that merely sparked years ago. Russell is best known for her award winning performances in  ""Auntie Mame"" (1958) and ""Gypsy"" (1962), and her great role as Hildy Johnson in ""His Girl Friday"" (1940).

Lewis Stone (1879-1953) plays a disgraced former sea captain. He was a major star in the 20s and 30s and was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Patriot"" (1930). Between 1914 and 1953 he made more than 150 films; his memorable roles were as the warden in ""The Big House"" (1930), Doctor Otternschlag in ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), and ""Doc"" in ""Three Godfathers"" (1936). Gretta Garbo used him in 7 of her films. He's probably best known for his continuing role as Judge Hardy in the Andy Hardy films (1937-46).

C. Aubrey Smith (1863-1948) was a great actor known for his roles as an aristocrat. He appeared in more than 100 films from 1915 to 1949. He gave us memorable roles in a host of films, including Major Hamilton in ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), Lord Capulet in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936), and Colonel Zapt in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" (1937). I remember him best as Col. Williams in ""Wee Willie Winkie"" (1937) with Shirley Temple. Smith plays the owner of the shipping line that Gable works for.

Hattie McDaniel (1895-1952) has an uncredited role as Harlow's maid. She once said - "" I'd rather play a maid than be one."" She's best known for her Oscar winning role as Mammy in ""GWTW"" (1939), one of more than 300 roles she played in a career from 1932 to 1952. I remember her best from her TV series ""Beulah"" (1952). McDaniel and Gable were good friends, and she appeared in several films with Harlow and Gable.

Director Tay Garnett (1894-1977) keeps the action moving. Though not well known today, Garnett was a busy director in the 30s and 40s and made films like ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" (1949), ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1945), and ""Bataan"" (1943).

There are some spectacular scenes during a Typhoon, and 50 tons of water are used to simulate the storm, nearly killing two stuntmen. Gable himself performs his stunts, which involve roping a steam locomotive that is thrashing around the deck. Though generally well shot and edited, there are periodic studio shots, especially close ups that are jarring. Most of these involve Harlow. Of course, it's difficult to complain about a close up of Harlow.

The great Herbert Stothart (1885-1949) was the composer. Stothart won the Oscar for ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) and was nominated 9 more times. He was often used in period pieces, and his films include ""Treasure Island"" (1934), Viva Villa"" (1934), ""David Copperfield"" (1935), Anna Karenina"" (1935), ""Tale of Two Cities"" (1935), and ""Romeo and Juliette"" (1936).

""China Seas"" was the #6 box office film for 1935. The top films were ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (with Gable), ""Becky Sharp"", ""Top Hat"", ""The Littlest Rebel"", and ""The Informer"". The Oscars went to ""Mutiny"" (Picture), ""The Informer"" (Actor), and ""Dangerous"" (Actress). Other notable films that year were ""Captain Blood"", ""Anna Karenina"", ""The 39 Steps"", ""The Bride of Frankenstein"", ""David Copperfield"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities"", Frederic March's ""Les Miserables"", and ""A Night at the Opera"". In Germany, Leni Riefenstahl released ""Triumph of the Will"".

If you like Gable and Harlow, this is the film for you. Think of it as ""Red Dust"" Part 2. There are certainly better action films and better special effects, but where else will you see the top 3 stars in such good roles.",1301011200,,6796,4.702270815811606

""China Seas"" is just such a film.  As usual, MGM threw in the lot - a melodramatic adventure, a giant cast with more than 2 box office stars and superb production values in every department, including an exciting storm at sea.

""China Seas"" stars macho Clark Gable as a ship captain trading in the Orient, dealing with raunchy tart Jean Harlow as his girlfriend, refined Rosalind Russell as his ladylike English fiancee and Wallace Beery as a gun running crook. They are supported by an endless parade of character actors including Lewis Stone, C. Aubrey Smith and Robert Benchley. The film is at different times funny, corny, exciting and absurd. It has everything.

The print is good and there are, for once on an MGM DVD, a few extras other than the original theatrical trailer.

Clark Gable plays Captain Alan Gaskell, at the helm of a ship bound for Singapore; and trying to shake off his unwelcome stowaway, former mistress Dolly ""China Doll"" Portland (Jean Harlow).  Adding even more complications is Gaskell's prim fiancee Sybil Barclay (Rosalind Russell).  The love triangle is set against the Hong Kong-Singapore voyage, complete with a ferocious storm and a pirate attack.

CHINA SEAS is a briskly-paced romantic adventure, peppered with razor sharp dialogue.  Clark Gable and Jean Harlow fall effortlessly back into the easygoing chemistry they shared in ""Red Dust"".  In a severely under-written role (which might have originally been pegged for Mary Astor), Rosalind Russell tries her best; Wallace Beery puts in a good-humored performance as the resident heel of the piece.

At heart it's just a post-Code Red Dust on the Hong Kong-Shanghai run, Harlow's distinctly not at her best rehashing her brassy platinum blonde act for the umpteenth time and Russell is more affected than alluring, but Tay Garnett keeps it moving so fast that it doesn't matter.

The Captain is trying to ditch Dolly & thinks he's meant for Lady Sybil, played by Rosalind Russell, an old flame. But he & Dolly really are in love. Unfortunately the collaborations between Harlow & Gable was cut short at five movies with Harlow untimely & early death several years later.",1141257600,8,1060,4.348484848484849
399134,5,6301967763,"This was the first film I saw that paired Clark Gable and Jean Harlow. I expected a lot from it and I was not disappointed. They were one of the finest screen teams of the 30s.

In a way, the plot is like RED DUST on the high seas. Gable is again in charge of a location and the leader of men, including a crew of Asians. Harlow is again the woman of easy virtue with a heart of gold. Rosalind Russell, in an entertaining turn as Sybil, Gable's long ago love, is a comedic and decidedly more classy dame who captures Captain Gaskill's attention, and who incites China Doll's jealousy. Wallace Beery, who worked with both Harlow and Gable in ""THE SECRET SIX"" and with Harlow in the 1933 classic ""DINNER AT EIGHT"" is enjoyably slick and subtly shady as Jamesy. But it is the chemistry between Harlow and Gable that really holds this movie together. They obviously had great respect and liking for one another, and this only cemented their working relationship on-screen. My favorite lines, one spoken by China Doll: ""When I want you to sound off, Golden Bells, I'll pull your rope!"" The other by Gaskill, with that unmistakable Gable grin: ""And as a man said when they were about to hang him, 'This will be a lesson to me.' "" It's a gem, and don't pass it up!!!!!",1141171200,2,1261,4.412017167381975

7818903,5,6301967763,"China Seas was one of the big hits of the Thirties, teaming Gable and Harlow together for the third time in three years, the other films being Red Dust and Hold Your Man. It is still a very entertaining film, kind of a Red Dust on the South China Sea. Gable is the gruff, barking sea captain, Harlow the crass woman with a past who loves him. There is quite a list of supporting players including Wallace Beery as a gambler who loves Harlow's Dolly character, Lewis Stone as a ship's officer with a bad reputation as a coward, the always estimable C.Aubrey Smith as the ship's owner and William Henry just put of The Thin Man as the youngest officer. Rosalind Russell is entirely convincing as the proper English Lady Sybil Barclay, a type of role you wouldn't associate with her. Robert Benchley played a constantly inebriated writer in bits that for me were tiresome and repetitive, but which may have seemed funny in the Thirties.

The ship has pretty nice interiors for a tramp steamer, but it adds a bit of glamour for the characters to be in nice surroundings rather than actual tramp steamer accommodations. The special effects during the typhoon are really good for the period, with huge waves washing over everyone and a genuine sense of peril. There are a few times that the plot developments get a bit creaky and there's a hard to follow subplot with some minor characters and a pearl necklace but those elements don't take away from the fact that this is a rousing good film.",1474416000,,1487,4.590225563909774

7818907,4,6301967763,"Directed by Tay Garnett, ""China Seas"" (1935) is a fun comedy/adventure film that pairs that lovable platinum blond alongside her usual co-star, Clark Cable.

The film is set on a ship sailing from Hong Kong to Singapore. Harlow plays Dolly ""China Doll"" Portland, who has a tumultuous on/off relationship with the ship's Captain Alan Gaskell (Gable). The 2 are clearly attracted to each other but their constant bickering gets in the way of developing a serious relationship. Things get further complicated when the beautiful and sophisticated Sybil Barclay (Rosalind Russell) boards the ship. Sybil is poised and aristocratic and has a romantic history with Alan; her presence causes friction between the insanely jealous Dolly and Alan who can't help hide his feelings towards his former, more refined girlfriend. Things then take a more drastic turn when China Doll accidently uncovers a sinister plot involving one of the ship's passenger's, Jamesy MacArdle (Wallace Beery); who is plotting to steal the gold aboard the ship and is working alongside a ruthless gang of pirtates.

Jean Harlow shines in this film. Her character is annoying; not possessing any filters. The type of woman who speaks before she thinks and doesn't realize her childish antics may have direct, dire consequences to others. However her mischievous blonde bombshell looks mighty fine and despite her flaws, we clearly see why a hard-nosed macho man's man would fall for her. She also wears some splendid skin-tight gowns that must have been sewn to her curvacious body (Note: there is a scene where she has an epic wardrobe malfuction that went completely over the heads of the censors). Harlow's comedic flair is also at its best here and whenever she is on the screen, you have a hard time taking your eyes off her as her fun, wise-cracking, platinum silhouette cuts a striking yet funny figure. Gable does his usual macho routine that you've probably seen countless times and the ever gracious Rosalind Russell is her usual charming best; a complete contrast to the brash, outspoken and flashy Dolly. Others in the cast worth mentioning are Lewis Stone, Ivan Lebedeff (always playing the bad guy) and the lovable Hattie McDaniel.

Aside from the fine cast, ""China Seas"" is very entertaining, combining comedy, drama with some thrilling action sequences. Although not the best out of Harlow's or Gable's film catalogue, this is definitely one of their most entertaining pairings and it definitely highlights their talents - especially Harlow's who arguably steals the show.

The DVD doesn't offer much in extras other than the film's trailer and the Vintage Fitzpatrick TravelTalk short: ""Cherry Blossom Time in Japan"". The picture quality is just decent. However the film is worth owning if you are a fan of any of the stars listed. For Harlow fans, this film is included in the set ""TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Legends - Jean Harlow"" which also included the classics ""Dinner at Eight"", ""Libeled Lady"" and the fan favorite ""Wife vs. Secretary"".",1453852800,,3036,5.11491935483871
