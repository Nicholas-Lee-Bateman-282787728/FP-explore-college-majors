8179238,5,B000NLMGL2,These are films commissioned by NASA for public space education. The Apollo 8 film is especially good at bringing out an inspirational philosophy. The Apollo 8 film is actually more interesting than the Apollo 11 film in my opinion. But all the films do a good job of covering these space missions that were made for the benefit of all mankind or humankind.,1383004800,,357,4.682539682539683
