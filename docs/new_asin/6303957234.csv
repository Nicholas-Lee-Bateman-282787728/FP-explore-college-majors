The video quality could be a bit better, but that may actually be part of its charm. It says in the credits, it is based on a party, well I want an invite to the next one! Sit back, have a cocktail, and enjoy the voyages of the crew of the USS Intercourse!",957225600,4,380,3.935064935064935

743523,5,6303957234,"This movie was shot on a low (very) budget and the effects are so cheap, but the storyline and the cast of mostly female impersonators make this a true camp classic. Not as raunchy as the John Waters/ Divine stuff, or as well produced as camp movies like Flesh Gordon or Rocky Horror Picture Show,  it is still as amusing and entertaining.  I first saw this at a College Independent Film Festival and loved it. It's been really hard to find  and I'm glad you can get it now on Amazon in DVD format. Unfortunately in may not be around long in this release so get it now and enjoy it forever.",1363737600,2,590,4.25

743525,5,6303957234,"To fully enjoy this movie you have to be *into* it.  This movie isn't about high production values or superb acting.

It's about a group of creative people who got together and had fun acting silly and making a movie.  Fortunately, Vegas in Space is extremely entertaining and unpredictable from start to finish.

I love this movie.",1177027200,3,332,4.771929824561403
743526,4,6303957234,"First off, this is a horrible movie.  All the actors are dressed in outrageously campy drag, with cheesy lines, and a plot that Ed Wood would have been ashamed of.  You can see the fishing wire holding up the asteroids; the cityscape of Vegas is clearly made out of cardboard and Barbie doll accessories.  It's not even a B-rate movie.  It's closer to P or Q.

That being said -- the actors KNOW it's a horrible movie.  And if you just want to sit back and do a Mystery Science Theater on the thing, it's great.  It's funny, cheesy, campy, and horrible, with more in-jokes and jabs and self-mocking than you can shake a stick at.  When the actors make comments about how the Queen of Police's palace looks ""kinda like a movie set"" and that a nightmare is just ""a bad dream sequence"", you have to take the movie with a grin and a light heart.

Oscar material it's not.  But it's great for what it aims to be -- a campy, ridiculous free-for-all.",1115856000,9,943,4.337142857142857
743527,5,6303957234,"This has got to be one of the silliest, and most campy movies ever made, and if you don't own it, or haven't seen it, GET IT!!
Despite all the camp, poor acting, hilariously [inexpensive] sets, and bad drag (in some instances), this film actually has a pretty good story line, with interesting twists and turns.
It pokes fun at so many of the early sci-fi series and movies, such as ""Lost in Space"", and ""Space 1999"", that you'll be laughing inspite of yourself at the cheesy references, even if you don't end up quoting so many of the film's slap stick lines that have become classic cliches.

Prepare yourself for the ultimate gender-bending ride through the galaxy.  It's more than just a cult classic ""B"" rate movie, it's a role model for all who need those sassy one liners, those strange yet fascinating make-up tips, and those who long for ""glamour in a world filled with mediocrity"".  If you don't see this, you may be the one element that stops Captain Traci Daniels from saving the universe.

743529,3,6303957234,"In the far distant future, a theft of priceless jewels with mysterious properties lead three agents to set down on a planet to investigate--but alas, they are men, and it's a ""women only planet.""  What to do?  Why, pop a pill and turn into women, of course!
Not all the performers are men in drag--the cast is filled out with quite a few busty-babes who are more than capable of giving their genderbending co-stars a run for their tassels--but if you enjoy drag queens, VEGAS IN SPACE is the movie for you.  And for the most part, the male-to-female performers are expert in their work--which ranges ultra-high camp to occasional bouts of good old fashioned tacky.  The script is silly, the cinematography, sets, special effects, and virtually everything else about the film is cheap.  But the performers make it fun, with Doris Fish heading the line up.  Watch out the Queen of Police doesn't bust ya for wearing beige!",1010534400,12,920,4.754716981132075
743530,2,6303957234,"Fun, but not as much fun as I remember it being. This is silliness, but when you're not really exhausted, drinking, or in a silly mood, this movie just sort of bores you. It really drags in places (no pun intended) and in others it's just not funny. Good for when you don't care enough to rent the very best.",999043200,2,308,4.15

7857460,5,6303957234,"Before Paris is Burning and Priscilla Queen of the Desert, there was Sydney's Legendary Child Doris Fish.  And she was glorious  The *ideas* that sprang from her mind... All you have to do is watch Vegas in Space to know her greatness.  Only Doris Fish could possibly co-write and star in a gender-bending, interstellar space spectacular.  With a theme song.

Vegas In Space should be mandatory viewing for every film buff in the known universe.  It's that Brilliant. (Or that Bad, depending upon your point of view.)  It's a gloriously kitschy delight - complete with sex-change pills and psychedelic dream sequence and legendary Queens of all kinds.  Oh, it's all just so... FABULOUS.  It's a joyous precursor to RuPaul's Drag Race - and quite possibly one of its inspirations.

I saw Vegas in Space through Amazon Prime Video; and I had to go out and purchase my own copy on DVD. Just in case. *You* know. This is a film with a heart - one that's Good. And shiny.  In these times of political uncertainty and downright hate, this movie is a little piece of heaven. Vegas in Space was goofily, lovingly made for times like this. It proves that through drag, everything is possible. Even Vegas in Space. *Especially* Vegas in Space.",1508544000,2,1233,4.741784037558685

The fact that it was filmed in one room explains a lot but on the other hand you would think it was filmed in a much larger area in some scenes.

Had a great time watching the movie, which took eight years to make, so much time and still awful results. This is one of those party movies that is so bad, you laugh all the way through it.
