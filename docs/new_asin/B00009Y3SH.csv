7994356,2,B00009Y3SH,"A cast comprised of three romantically interwoven couples, with an additional pair who spend a good portion of this film discussing their failed relationships, deals hopelessly with a jumbled script and lacklustre direction, eventually sinking beneath the force of hollow purpose. Some of the players, notably Sarah Trigger, Sheryl Lee, and Esai Morales, produced some crackle for their dialogue, but this studentish production softened the effect. This type of scenario, involving cleverly coincidental connections among the cast, is more commonplace today than when this work was released (1994); in this instance, however, all chance of freshness was broken down by weak architectonics.",1117152000,3,689,5.764705882352941
7994357,2,B00009Y3SH,"This movie is a whole lot of talk with no real surprises, interesting story lines, or interesting characters. I viewed this on DVD due to the  fact that it had Heather Graham, whom I loved in Austin Powers 2 and Boogie  Nights. She gives a strong performance as do most of the other cast  members, however the rest of the cast is filled with no-names which was  kind of disappointing. Aside from Heather Graham this movie was not really  worth my time. The DVD didn't have a whole lot of extras which was  disappointing because that is one of my favorite things about DVD's. Unless  you're a big Heather Graham fan like me I suggest not watching this movie  on DVD or VHS.",967075200,2,672,4.40650406504065
