4713171,4,B005JTTYDG,"Zoe's content is absolutely 5 star. The breadth of material covered is staggering. The ONLY thing I thought was lacking content-wise was more performances. I expected to get at least one performance on each disc. Unless I'm missing something, there are only 2 performances total. Zoe has such a fun personality and makes the material easily understandable and fun.

Video quality is lacking. I'd give that 3 stars. The sets are poorly lit, the mirror is really too small, and she often has to stand at an awkward angle to utilize the mirror. Cheeky Girls videos usually have great production quality in my opinion, so I was pretty disappointed that this video does not.

Given that (for me) the content is 5 star and the quality is 3 stars, I settled on 4 stars.

I will also mention that I've never met a tribal dancer who would be offended, but she does exhibit some colorful language in the make up tutorial. Nothing major, and not offensive to me, but wanted to throw that in just in case it might help someone decide whether to purchase.

If you are the least bit interested in tribal fusion belly dance, you really must have this set. The value is just unbelievable.",1325980800,18,1172,4.6201923076923075
4713172,5,B005JTTYDG,"This has to be the most value for your money that you can get.  There is so much information in this instruction set, it will take a long, long time to work through it.  I am sooooooooooooo happy with this purchase.  Great job Zoe!",1325116800,2,231,4.204545454545454
4713173,5,B005JTTYDG,"Seriously, this is such a great value.  She's an amazing teacher and innovator, invaluable to our dance community.  It will pay for itself in one viewing.

In addition to normal drills and combos, she's included exercises for bellydancers, video from workshops, makeup tutorial and performances...over 7 hours on 4 DVDs.  Just buy it already.",1325116800,5,342,5.277777777777778
4713174,5,B005JTTYDG,I love the fact she has a makeup tutorial. Four dvds full of helpful information and by one of tribal's greatest dancers. I recommend it highly :D,1323302400,4,146,4.444444444444445
4713175,5,B005JTTYDG,"I think this DVD set is an amazing resource for anyone interested in tribal fusion belly dance, obviously particularly if you want to learn more about Zoe's stylization. There are over seven hours of content, but the DVDs are set up so that it is easy to break up your practice into a manageable time frame.

With the option of drilling moves, learning combos, strengthening exercises, or workshop style classes - you can tailor a practice session to whatever fits your mood that day. There is an almost conversational-style explanation of the drills or combos, and then moving on to drilling with music and very little or no speaking (there are some text prompts to remind of the basic movement being performed). It helps make the flow of the practice feel more natural. Also, the camera angles are consistent so there is never a question of which side you should be performing a move on.

Zoe Jakes and Cheeky Girl Productions outdid themselves here. This is definitely worth the investment (in money and in time!).",1322956800,6,1017,4.805714285714286
4713176,5,B005JTTYDG,"This Dvd set is amazing. My gf's and I likely own every dvd related to bellydance and I think aside Rachel Brice's Serpentine -this is one of the best ones I have come across.

I think there is great information on this set for begginer dancers and even more so for advanced dancers. Even if you can't pick up all the concepts to begin with you can start to try and get the muscle memory for them and apply later when your technique has been built up enough to support the combinations. While washing dishes or folding laundry try layering, it totally helps! lol.

I like that the dvds are sort of random too, so you might work one concept and skip to a whole other on the next chapter which helps prevent boredom.

Preordered this dvd, got it likely as soon as it was out, and I still haven't made it through everything. If you though RB's dvd was challenging take it in another direction and get this dvd, it will make you practice practice practice",1321747200,12,951,4.361581920903955
4713177,5,B005JTTYDG,"WOW!!!=oO I can't get over how packed full of various bellydance instructions are in this 4 dvd set! If you read the Editorial Review and watch the video posted in another review it goes into more detail of all that Zoe's dvds offer.
I can use these dvds daily to get a full spectrum of various bellydance techniques and styles. As always Zoe is very thorough in her explanations - she basically explains, gives a slow breakdown of the moves and then we practice what she's shown us.

In this 4dvd set you are getting:
 Bellydancing conditioning exercises
 9 combos (not including the combos you learn on the bonus workshop videos)
 Learning techniques like flutters (the MOST thorough explanation of doing flutters I've EVER seen in my 20+years of belly dancing!!), Zoe's famous *hits*,  learning how to lead with various parts of the body, layering, dancing with feather fans (which I've never seen a dvd that covers this...)
 And there is also an extended practice, M.U. tips, various performances, etc...

These 4 dvds are PACKED full of good stuff! A MUST HAVE for belly dancers!!=oD",1321401600,44,1088,4.848648648648648
4713178,5,B005JTTYDG,"This DVD set is amazing, and Zoe is a amazing instructor. She breaks all the Combinations and Layering down so that you can follow and she repeats on each side, in the first DVD she talks about posture which is great for everyone to recall, I have been into Belly Dance for 15 years (since I was 12) and I got this DVD to Help advance my dance and with just one hour with it I could tell the differents right away, I would say that a beginner may have issues with some of the things she goes over but you can follow along as she gives different levels of learning which is great for everyone.

The 40min Workshop at the end of disc 1 is great to use as well makes you feel as if you are in her workshop I loved it.

This is a must have for those out there who wish to advance thier dance, rather you are a Tribal fusion dancer or another style this DVD set is a great addtion to your study of this amazing art form, the price tag is a steal for sure. Don't wait get this DVD set as soon as you can.

4713181,3,B005JTTYDG,"I have never really used this DVD set. I have however looked through it several times. I am just overall disapointed. There is definitely a lot of information on these, but she does so much talking in between moves that you lose interest. She may do 2 figure 8's and then stop and talk for 5 minutes. I would not say this is a good warm up nor is it good for a belly dance workout. If you sit down with a notepad and take notes on what she says it's good info, but again, a lot of talking. For what she actually does in moves, it could have been put on one DVD and called it good. For as little as I've used it, it wasn't worth the money.",1390262400,3,638,3.9153846153846152
4713182,4,B005JTTYDG,"I bought this because I have attended a couple tribal fusion belly dance classes, and really love this dance form, but I am not very good at it and wanted to learn more at home.

4713183,3,B005JTTYDG,"Terrible videography- dancing with her back to us for the combos while facing a mirror is opposite what it intends- for you to dance along following the leader from behind-the mirror is reminiscent of a school chalkboard and very limiting.  Not the greatest/most effective quality instruction- she went on and on about finding the right lighting on a stage, and then proceeded to dance in the poorly lit part for the demo...she spent five minutes telling how to stylistically snap your fingers, but didn't even explain the complicated arm wrapping and hand/wrist rotations for any of the following movements!  Not the best in any measure, but she is a beautiful dancer and very graceful.",1386892800,3,687,5.017543859649122

4713186,3,B005JTTYDG,I got these discs and they were all damaged and scratched most of the disc were loose in the dvd box it came in.  I looked through it.  It doesn't seem to be a beginners dvd.  It seems like it is for people who are already tribal dancers.  She seems really down to earth which I like.  If I could dance tribal I would really love this dvd to expand my moves.

Having 2 years under my belt already, I gotta say I love this video set! She really explains things for me and I like that she goes right into moves and routines. I can't wait til I can successfully complete this video set with ease!",1369440000,,369,4.211267605633803
4713188,5,B005JTTYDG,"I had actually per-ordered this DVD before it could be purchased, and eagerly was awaiting it for quite a while. So, when it arrived, I was OVERJOYED, because I'd also attended classes of Zoe in person before.
(So, I've been using it off & on for quite a while now.)

1st, I would like to say, if you are a beginner, there are a number of parts you should skip, and stick to either the live classes, the fan instruction, and the ""Hits"", but the warm-ups are well worth trying to get into as well. Also, the make-up tutorial demo is FABULOUS, because it discusses stage lighting.

It is Boot-camp style lessons, but Zoe does put in lots of explaining.

If you are new to dance, you might not understand what ""lines"" are yet, but Zoe has a tricky way of getting you into moves with better lines, and body geometry, without you even noticing or thinking about it.

If you are a beginner, I would say stick to in person bellydance classes with a live teacher for a while first, or at least practice some basic DVDs, or a master all the episodes of ""Shimmy"" first, and when you becomes board with basics and would like to move on, this is a good one to get curious about.

Try Zoe's BDSS DVD ""Killer Drills"" first before this one.

Good for some intermediates, and especially advanced students.
If you are looking for something harder, get THIS!

The DVD set is very much like a visual Encyclopedia, and has stuff all over the place, of all sorts of things, and it's something you can work with for a very long time.

Since, I'm a video editor myself, I kinda wonder about just what material got cut out, because there are times when it feels like there's something missing, or something is random.
For example, there's a random performance of Zoe dancing a spicy cabaret cross-over which includes her ultra beautiful signature styles of explosive fire cracker & robust spins, or turns. So, I was confused. Wait, was this just in the materials we just covered? ;) Great stuff tho'!

This is a good collection of new ways of doing moves in a more muscular manner, such as chest lifts from the diaphragm, and subtle movements with posture, a variation on the ""side winder"" using ""Hits"" instead of popping & locking like the usual Tribal Fusion moves from the shoulders, and with very challenging combinations, and layering.

PLEASE go easy on this, because you can hurt yourself if you try diving into it suddenly.",1367712000,,2407,4.550925925925926
4713189,5,B005JTTYDG,"There is so much on these discs! It is well worth the money and I haven't gotten through them all yet. This set covers everything and then some. Zoey is an amazing teacher and dancer, and is really great at teaching the moves so that anyone can learn them. Absolutely amazing stuff on here.",1367280000,,290,4.388888888888889
4713190,4,B005JTTYDG,"This is a fantastic DVD for someone who is either a fully trained dancer, training in dance or if you're like me who is dedicated to making belly dance a sort of a yoga-like practice. I've been practicing some basic Arabic style belly dance off and on for almost 10 yrs but I just got into tribal about 8 months ago. I bought this DVD around then and I was so frustrated I couldn't keep up. The terminology and steps totally threw me. Zoe teaches quickly and it's true that the DVD is very boot camp style. I was upset because I am such a fan of Zoe. I tucked this gem in my collection away until recently.

I subscribed to Datura.com about 4 months ago and learned quite a bit. On a scale of 1=beg, 2=int, & 3=adv. I would comfortably say I'm a 1.5. I've got a basic handle on layering, hip, chest, arm and foot work and now I feel I'm gaining something from this awesome DVD. If you are starting from scratch and can't take live classes I would recommend Rachel Brice's Datura.com! Zoe is a guest teacher on there as well. Best of luck :)",1364256000,3,1040,4.2
4713191,5,B005JTTYDG,I have only just started working with this set and I am already amazed and the amount of material and information that it encompasses. This is like having Zoe in your house as a personal instructor. The information is presented with both lower and upper level adjustments so it is nice to have a way to build up your practice. I would recommend that the person buying this has some belly dance knowledge under their belt or this may be to much for them. I am really looking forward to using this set of dvd's for years to come to learn new information and drill.,1363392000,,562,4.3619047619047615
4713192,5,B005JTTYDG,This is one of the best DVDs I own now! Way to go Zoe! You made the moves easy by explaining them in detail.,1362873600,,108,3.5416666666666665
4713193,4,B005JTTYDG,"Disk One:
Introduction
Warm up: Her warm up section instruction went to fast. It was a kind of follow the bouncing butt. The voice over was going while she was doing the movements. But there was no breakdown. For instance while in  the lunge she says to keep the pelvic tucked., that should  have been stated before going into the movement. This warm-up will work who it works for.

Posture;
The posture section was great. I really believe great posture makes the movements all the more beautiful.

Traveling steps
Explained ,-I really liked the information presented in this section. She talks about different ways to travel and why filling out your stage is good. I like the look of al of the traveling steps that were demonstrated. I also liked them because the could be utilized in a variety of belly dance styles.

Practice; I like the fact that she switched sides, so you are forced to work both sides. But in no way with that short practice time are you going to ingrain these movements. Be prepared to drill on your own.  She does two speeds slow and full time. I like the fact that you can visually see her get into posture before each  set of movements.

Flutters: Her explanation was decent

Combinations: Both combinations start with a short demonstration then into explanations. The explanations move fast.

  This DVD is not for beginners. There is hardly any movement breakdown given. Even intermediate student s will struggle. It will be up to the individual if you want to go for it or not. I liked the DVD for the posture tips and workshops. The majority of the combinations I did not like neither did I care for the performances. For a cheeky girls production I thought the back drop would be a little better. Zoe can also be a little chatty. She is a bit nervous at first and it shows. She seems a little jittery and breathless in the beginning.
  For me the DVD was just okay. I do believe that if you stick with it, it will condition you for this kind of tribal fusion and for dancers already in this style I think this would be an excellent DVD to add to your library . Again my favorite parts were workshops and that to me is not worth $40.00. Overall though it is hard to rate this DVD anything lower than a 4 when you get 4 full DVD'S. My rate would be a 3.8. I will take this DVD from another angle though,since this is for the serious belly dancer and that is-would it give someone who wanted to advance their dance results and that answer is YES!!...

4713194,5,B005JTTYDG,As any Zoe Jakes dvd it is challenging.  I have not completed the entire set but my flexability has improved alot.  It is great for any style of dance.  Make up tips are great for that proffessional polish,1361145600,,205,4.342105263157895
4713195,4,B005JTTYDG,"The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's not really geared towards people who want to learn the moves.

From the way she breaks things down to putting things into practice, to the loads and loads of new information in here, it's been a long time since a belly dance DVD didn't reuse old methods, but I would dare to say there's not a single unoriginal thing in here.  It's all new.  And it's all good.  If you're into dance at all - not even belly dance, just dance - you will most likely find at least some utility in this set.

Picked it up months later as an intermediate student and now find that I can follow along with Zoe. The dvd includes four disks and I must say, it never gets old and I'm able to supplement it in between classes. She covers so much in this DVD and it's all well-explained and demonstrated. I easily learned to flutter using her techniques! I'd say that lastly, she also covers things way in-depth that other dvd's don't; one being the most important, posture. I'd say that you won't go wrong buying this dvd, it's well worth the money.",1355356800,,658,4.401639344262295
4713204,4,B005JTTYDG,"The only negative I can say about this dvd pack is I think in trying to appeal to the beginners and the advanced students - there is way too much chatty talking in the instructions.  I find myself getting annoyed with the beginning of the instructions for the combinations that she is moving toward.  I also don't like the combinations much.  I think they are a little complicated and dramatic for ordinary use. However, the workshop extra feature is great.

4713206,5,B005JTTYDG,This is a fantastic dvd set for the novice or pro bellydancer.  Zoe breaks it down very smooth....it's fun and a good workout.  You won't be disappointed!,1343088000,2,154,4.666666666666667
4713207,5,B005JTTYDG,Zoe is an amazing dancer and an amusing teacher. This DVD set brings her right into your home. This is NOT a beginners DVD. I found it was heard even for an intermediate dancer to follow everything. She definitely challenges me. She breaks down some things but then skips on to the advanced stuff very quickly. I do not recommend this for a new belly dancer. I do recommend it for an intermediate to advanced dancer to supplement your regular dance practice.,1341532800,2,458,4.597560975609756
4713208,5,B005JTTYDG,"First I'll say that I'm a ""super beginner"" at bellydance who - while I definitely see / appreciate Zoe's talent - has tended to resonate more with other dancers' ""styles"". And I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money on this disc, knowing I may never be at her level, and knowing that I'm not really into her popping style, which she does so amazingly (among other styles).  Well -  I'm really glad I got this disc. Though most of this material IS waaaayy beyond my level - I can say with confidence after just 40 minutes of disc 1, it's worth every penny. This DVD is NOT geared to teaching basic moves -- it's assumed you know them -- but it's still enriching for beginners. Well, let me take that back. There is some ""raw beginner"" material -- fluttering, posture, and some of the travelling. But it's really geared to teaching how to connect and approach moves, and perform them. It's kind of the glue that keeps moves together and also elevates them. The piece on posture is awesome, as is the warmup!!!! ... Many layers here for anyone really interested in the artistry of the dance. I'm looking forward to Disc 3, where she talks about how she powers/initiates movements. I definitely recommend this for any dancer, even if it's beyond you. This DVD gives something unique, and much to aspire to. I have a new appreciation for her unique artistry and talent, as a teacher, and a dancer. Thank you Zoe!!!!",1340064000,7,1412,4.533333333333333
4713209,5,B005JTTYDG,"I have been belly dancing for 10 years now and I wish I had had these DVD's when I started dancing! Zoe Jake's discussion on posture alone was worth buying these dvd's for. I have corrected some bad habits and learned new things which after dancing for so long was just great! The only thing I have to say about areas where improvement is needed is that the camera person needs to concentrate on filming all of her body, at some points when doing hip movements the camera is focused on her face and upper body. This is a problem that is found in most dance DVD's so it is to be expected, I don't think camera people realize that when learning a new move one needs to see the dancers whole body! These are wonderful dvd's!",1334620800,,721,4.2700729927007295
4713210,4,B005JTTYDG,"The range of subject covered in the DVD set is good, diverse and interesting; Zoe Jakes is great dancer/performer, her techinique is awesome.

But I doubt anyone whith a high-intermediate or advanced level of bellydance will be able to easily follow most of the parts, at least on the first go: DVD 1 already starts (after a rather long discussion on posuture, which although has common points is approached with very different ways depending on the dancer you're following) with traveling movements that imply layering.

Zoe seems in a rush to get through the DVDs, and as others have pointed out the setting is rather second class (dark, with small mirror, sometimes weird filming angles).

The DVD is a good buy to learn and review stuff if you have enough patience and discipline to try catch up with her technique; but it does seem, once again, that it was mainly targeted to either dancers who already have the skills supposedly being tought, or who are very well acquainted with Zoe's teaching style.",1330387200,8,1007,4.843023255813954
4713211,5,B005JTTYDG,"OK, I bought her killer drillz dvd first and wanted to scream.  I'm a dancer and I just wanted to give up.  But I went ahead and bought this one after that (go figure) and it is super! Love it! I especially like her versatility on choreo and her mixes with fosse.  Her layering explanations really helped.  I love Serpentine also, but she didn't really break down the shimmy part, and this helped me with both dvd's to get better.  Rubbing my tummy and patting my head is much easier now haha.",1328918400,3,493,4.315217391304348
4713212,5,B005JTTYDG,"She explains everything very well. She repeats movements so you can have a good practice of the movements and really nail down the dance that follows. I really like the that A to Zoe has different levels of learning. It's not like other belly dance dvds where there is only one level and once you have past that level you have to buy a new dvd at your newly achieved level of dance. It really is a great disc set.

4713213,5,B005JTTYDG,Zoe is really brilliant at her craft.  She is very straight forward wither her explanations and examples. It is a enjoyable workout.,1328313600,2,132,5.0
4713214,5,B005JTTYDG,This DVD set is one of the best ever for advanced tribal fusion. It gives you all you need to improve your dance. Zoe is very generous and gives you many trick. If you are an absolute beginner I suggest to start with something more basic.,1327190400,2,238,4.195652173913044
4713215,4,B005JTTYDG,"I've had to go back to more basic bellydance DVDs for beginners to warm up to this one. This one definitely for dancers, lots of choreographies.",1326931200,,144,4.576923076923077
4713216,5,B005JTTYDG,"Great Video!!!!! Easy to follow, and all new material from Zoe. Material for all levels of dance whish is encouaging. Its a must buy!!",1326499200,,134,4.625
4713217,5,B005JTTYDG,"This DVD was produced by the well-known, professional ""Cheeky Girl"" production unlike some of the other BDSS DVDs.
This DVD is excellent value for you money.  You get 4 disc that will keep you occupied for a long time with her wealth of information, techniques and combos.  The DVDs are setup in chapters so you can easily break up your practice.
Zoe breaks down her techniques quite well and then drills.  Zoe moves onto combos which Zoe clearly explains with practice after.  Zoe's signature techniques, moves and gestures are covered.  Example of just some of her techniques covered are: flutters (great explanation and breakdown), her acclaimed Zoe ""hits"", different traveling moves with layering, feather fans.  This is 1st DVD I have (and I have many belly dance) that covers feather fans!  She also includes bonus teaching of her workshops and a tribal makeup tutorial!  She has a couple lovely performances included throughout DVDs!
On Zoe's hit section, she explains ""hits"" and the difference between pop, locks and hits.
She covers her signature ""release and recoil"". She follows each of this explanations with drills then progresses to combos with practice for the combos.
The only thing that could be improved is Zoe and team NOT using mainly that same song throughout all 4 DVDs.
You can tell Zoe and her team put an EXTREME amount of effort into this DVD collection.  You won't be disappointed.",1326326400,4,1408,4.982905982905983
4713218,4,B005JTTYDG,"Incredibly Helpful for Intermediate to Advanced dancers, repeated use of this video will absolutely help with fluidity, control, etc.

My only pet peeve is she is a bit awkward at first, clearly nervous, she should have recorded her movements and voice over separately.

But definitely a worthwhile purchase that any level of dancer can build on (save for complete beginners perhaps)",1326153600,2,383,5.262295081967213
4713219,5,B005JTTYDG,Anything Zoe Jakes does is fantastic.  I can't believe what all these DVD's have.  It must have taken her HOURS to prepare for these!  Thank you for your hard work and dedication Zoe.,1326067200,,183,4.484848484848484

8476016,2,B005JTTYDG,"Yes, Zoe Jakes is brilliant.  When ""A to Zoe"" came out ... it was the first and only instructional material by Zoe ... which is why it got so many 5-star reviews (I assume).
BUT ... better options now exist ... I advise you NOT to waste your money on this DVD set unless you can get it used and cheap.

Yes, the make-up tutorial is great ... but you only need to watch it once or twice ...

The actual DANCE instruction is all over the place - no focus.  Which might be great if you need to kill time and want to bond with the fast forward button on your remote looking for that part you liked ... oh, wait ... it wasn't on this disc ... maybe on the other disc?  Where was it again?  I spent more time LOOKING for the material I wanted to drill than actually drilling it!  If you want to study with Zoe, I recommend her Datura material.  It is organized by topic so you can pick and choose what you want to study.  Plus the production is waaaaay better.

Production on A to Zoe is poor by today's standards (2014).  The camera angles aren't correct  You either follow her teaching facing you with no mirror ... or when they shoot from behind into the mirror ... it isn't a real studio mirror so you don't really see the reflection very well.  Sometimes the camera ONLY shoots the Mirror ... so you don't see Zoe ... just the reflection in the mirror.

Nowadays, the standard for dance videos is to shoot from BEHIND the teacher and INCLUDE the mirror-image in the shot so it is just like being in a dance class.  At this point in the history of technology ... anything less is just silly.  WHy waste your time trying to follow bad camera angles?

If you want to study from Zoe Jakes, I recommend DATURA.  Her Datura material is better organized, focused on particular topics and shot from the correct camera angles.  You will learn much faster from the Datura material than from A to Zoe.
I am a professional dancer and have studied dozens of instructional videos / DVD / Streaming etc.  This one is not worth all the 5-star reviews and not worth the new price.  Zoe is great ... this DVD set is not.",1415145600,7,2101,4.241813602015113

8476018,5,B005JTTYDG,"This is a fabulous DVD set.  It's a little of a-LOT!  Zoe is very good at breaking down what the movement is, and presenting it in more than one way.  I've referred several of my students to this one.",1404777600,,200,4.076923076923077
8476019,4,B005JTTYDG,"It's good, but this is the first DVD that I purchased and like some of the reviews said, it's good, but it might be difficult for beginners. I think the fact that it's dimly lit and the mirror is a bit away from the camera makes it a bit hard to practice. My favourite part of this set though is Zoe teaching a workshop at the end of 3 of the 4 DVDs, because of its uninterrupted flow. After this DVD I purchased Serpentine by Rachel Brice that I absolutely love, and it seems easier to follow. But I am hoping to go back to this one maybe a bit later when i get better.",1404000000,2,570,3.965217391304348
