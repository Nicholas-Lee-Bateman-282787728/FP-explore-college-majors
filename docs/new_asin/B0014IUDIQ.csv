8255878,3,B0014IUDIQ,"Mario Sperry begins with the premise that your opponent knows what you know, and therefore you must be prepared to get reversed, sprawled, or countered against. It is on this premise that Sperry demonstrates which techniques work against such an opponent. These dvd's won't turn you into a vale tudo master, but it will teach you the basics of VT.

The only problem I had with the series was that it was lacking instructions on mount defense. What would happen if someone mounted you? It seems Sperry assumes you will be in full control of the fight once it starts.",1319241600,2,565,4.65
