8041874,5,B0006M1YKC,"I'm partial for this video tape. I was one of the numerous persons present for Bob Hope's Berlin show in November 1969. All these years I was hoping to find it in someone's library or archives, but never did. Then last year (2010) someone told me that the video tape was available for purchase on Amazon, so I bought my own copy and saw it for the first time. After the show got aired on NBC I heard I was seen on the Berlin segment. Sure enough that is true. After Bob says the word ""Tempelhof"" for about 2 seconds this Spring Chick is shown in uniform and laughing at his joke. So, you can see how I can be partial.",1315008000,,617,4.107438016528926
8041875,3,B0006M1YKC,"GUTHY-RENKER's VHS of BOB HOPE'S CHRISTMAS WITH THE TROOPS is a heavily-edited one-hour version of an in-color NBC-TV broadcast that originally ran 90 minutes without commercial interruption. The 1/16/69 ""Bob Hope Christmas Special: Around the World with the USO"" had lots of Bob, plus lots of entertainment. What's left after a heavy G-K axe is mostly Hope's monologues and kidding with troupe members or military guests.

Sadly, here's what you DON'T get on this tape: Ann-Margret, Rosey Grier, the Golddiggers, Honey LTD., songs, skits and other fun.
