8285557,4,B001C0L7U4,"WHAT EVER YOU SAY was a delightful surprise.  Directed and starring Guillaume Canet (who also co-wrote) and the terrific Francois Berleand, tells a somewhat predictable story of a young man wanting to rise to the top as a TV host to a humiliating show that would thrill Jerry Spinger.  The producer (Francois Berleand) senses Mr. Canet's ""lean and hungry"" look but also his immaturity as to how the game of power is played.  Diane Kruger is the bait that lures Bastien into a weekend at their country estate.  It is here where the real fun and nightmare begins.  As the invited guest, he is treated to the an evening with the wife, later given the frightening experience of feeding a caged flock of vultures.  This is a beginning ... I will give away no more except the very ending gives Francois Berleand a truly magnificent send-off.  Plus seeing Mr. Canet in a big bunny suit is worth the price of admission.  He is a man of obvious talent.  This is a comedy with panache.",1346025600,,975,4.557471264367816
