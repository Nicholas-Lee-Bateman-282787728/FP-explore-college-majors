The story begins with a rider on his horse ""Tarzan"". Elsewhere two riders meet a man on a wagon. Collins wants to buy Markham's land. Later, a shot hits Markham. A rider stops the runaway wagon, then checks the spot where the shot was fired. Ken Mitchell inherited his uncle Jim's ranch. Was Collins ""the most respected man"" in town? Ken learns his uncle was hated because he loaned money to farmers and then foreclosed when they couldn't pay. Ken learns that his uncle was shipping more cattle than he owned. Who was he working for? Ken follows the tracks, and is attacked by three men. But he catches them and appears to throw in with them (he wants to learn who runs them). Ken recommends subtle sabotage rather than violence.

Ken asks the Sheriff to foreclose on the Clayton ranch. The ""Phantom Rider"" leaves money so Clayton can pay off his mortgage. The wire fences are cut on the Markham ranch, but quickly repaired. The ""Phantom Rancher"" prevents arson at the Markham ranch. There are other fires at other ranches. Collins plans a cattle stampede to ruin the crops of the small ranchers, then sell this herd across the border. Will they attempt to poison the water supply? Ken continues to work undercover to fool Collins. Glover meets Ken and learns the truth. Miss Markham finds those men changing brands, and is captured. The ""Phantom Rancher"" frees her. The Sheriff arrives to capture Collins' men at his house. Collins tries to blame Mitchell, but this is shown to be a lie. There should be a happy ending.

The story about poor people being saved by a gift of money goes back to St. Nicholas (the legend of Santa Claus). It was also part of the Robin Hood legend. The Great Depression caused people to hope for a miraculous act of charity. [Rodeo star Ken Maynard seems to be developing a tummy in this film.]",1277683200,,1852,4.623100303951368
7931693,4,B000056ATM,"PHANTOM RANCHER (1940) is from Ken Maynard's wide-waist era and is one of his last starring films in a Western series. Produced by ultra low-budget Colony Films the cheapness really shows. Bad film stock, bad stock footage inserts, bad scripting, acting and direction...just downright bad all-around!
However, Ken still has that appealing charm, that winning persona, that likable character presence that can shine above any amount of badness to be dished out. And Tarzan is always a big help as well!
In this one Ken must disguise himself as the Phantom Rancher in order to secure money to be payed back to himself to prevent the foreclosure of rancher's loans. It seems all the ranchers think Ken is the one out to get them when in reality it's really ace bad-guy Ted Adams (in a suit this time) behind all the murderous scheming.
Usual heavy Tom London is the lawman and usual good guy Dave O'Brien is the top hench/ heavy. Once again O'Brien (DEVIL BAT, CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT, etc.) shines in a poverty row production! He could have been a leading man in A-productions...their loss, our gain.
This is certainly a good, slam-bang B-Western with likeable Ken Maynard in a Lone Ranger type role, some great baddies and some awful production values...still, fun can be had here.
Pop open a beer (...err, carton of milk), pour out a bowl of nacho chips, sit back and enjoy the mysterious PHANTOM RANCHER riding at night to right all wrongs and save the valley from...himself!
Enjoy.",1184630400,3,1476,4.83794466403162
