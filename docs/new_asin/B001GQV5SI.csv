8306710,4,B001GQV5SI,"One forgets what a great game this was, because it get overshadowed by Webber's timeout
A lot of depth on UNC's team, but Michigan got some good contributions from it's bench too.
It wasn't all about just the Fab Five.
Donald Williams and George Lynch were fantastic. Billy Packer was a bit annoying",1378944000,,299,4.660377358490566
8306711,4,B001GQV5SI,"DVD of the 1993 NCAA championship game. No other items included like interviews, history, etc. Simply a replay of the game.",1360540800,2,123,4.904761904761905
8306712,1,B001GQV5SI,This is a DVD made with Reel to reel quality.  The picture looks horrible.  It looks like a game from the stone ages.  There is too much technology to produce a product that looks like this and sell it at the price this sells for.  I am a true Tarheel fan and can watch just about anything but this is unbearable....,1310428800,2,316,4.131147540983607
8306713,1,B001GQV5SI,"This DVD is supposed to contain the full broadcast of the game, but it is missing footage from around 16:52 to 15:36 of the second half.  It is the same missing footage problem as the previous release of this DVD from a few years ago with a generic DVD cover (see here and you can read my review of that one: http://www.amazon.com/1993-NCAA-Division-Basketball-Championship/dp/B000NPP9K8/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1263111122&sr=8-5).  And I haven't watched all of the disc, so it is possible that even more of the game is missing.

Another problem is that there is some kind of manufacturing problem with this DVD (not present in the previous release of the DVD), because I bought one and tried to play it, and it froze around the 11:25 mark of the first half.  It froze in the same spot in 3 different DVD players, so it was definitely a problem with the disc.  So I contacted the seller to exchange the DVD for another one, and the replacement disc froze in the exact same place (in all 3 DVD players again)!

The first 5 seconds of audio are missing, and then the next 10 seconds have an echo on Billy Packer's mic, but that's not too big of a deal, compared with the previous things I mentioned.

This DVD is an actual pressed DVD, unlike the previous release of the DVD, which was a DVD-R and used inkjet printing on the disc (I got ink all over my fingers, the ink came off so easily when it contacted normal sweat on my fingers).

Due to the first 2 things that I mentioned, I would not recommend this DVD.  (And if you read my review for the previous release, I wouldn't recommend the previous release either.)",1263081600,10,1621,4.620209059233449
