8507418,2,B00701QRMM,"Terrible acting.  A poor High Noonish movie.  No explanation for why a boy could peek in the saloon window, but no one in a position to kill the bad guys could.  Worst fake amputation ever.  One can tell it's merely a clenched fist.  Tedious and boring.  The only reason I gave it two stars was I watched it until the end.  Oh, sheriff is wearing worst toupee ever.",1514419200,,365,4.279411764705882
