2683813,5,B000K7VHMS,This is a very nice collection of Alice Faye movies.  I am a fan of the 30's and 40's films especially the musicals.  The Alice Faye collection is terrific.,1346889600,,156,4.344827586206897
2683814,5,B000K7VHMS,"Golden-haired songstress Alice Faye was ""Queen of Fox"" for nearly a decade, yet her prodigious film output has been limited on DVD to a few films, mostly with Tyrone Power; ""The Alice Faye Collection"" is a long-overdue celebration of her life and work, and should win a new generation of fans!

Four of her best films are offered, with terrific special features (including a two-part biography featuring her two daughters), entertaining commentaries, two episodes of her very funny radio show (co-starring husband Phil Harris), deleted scenes, and production materials. Best of all, her final appearance on film, a brief retrospective sponsored by Pfizer, is included, offering the still-beautiful Faye (at 70) lovingly reminiscing about Power and Don Ameche, as well as extolling keeping fit. It is irresistible!

The films of the collection:

""On the Avenue"" (1937): Rising star Faye, in support of Dick Powell (borrowed from Warner), and Madeleine Carroll, very nearly steals the film from both! A thin tale (Broadway writer/star Powell spoofs heiress Carroll in a review, then falls for her) benefits also from the Ritz Brothers' maniacally comic numbers; a great opportunity to view Darryl Zanuck's reality 'grounded' approach to production numbers, as well as 22-year-old Faye's beauty, sauciness, and sexy contralto singing voice...4 stars (out of Five)

""Lillian Russell"" (1940): 25-year-old Faye, now Hollywood's box office champ, in a big, fanciful, loving musical biopic of America's first female superstar. Supported by four of Hollywood's best leading men (Henry Fonda, Don Ameche, Edward Arnold, and Warren William) as the loves of her life, Faye imbues Russell with charm, sexiness, and an endearing innocence...5 stars (out of Five)

""That Night in Rio"" (1941): Although Faye was exhausted during filming, she still looked breathtaking in this Technicolor musical. A slight tale, of Ameche (in dual roles) as an American entertainer hired to imitate a lookalike Brazilian Baron, the film lights up whenever Carmen Miranda appears on screen; Faye shines as the Baron's neglected wife. Best remembered as the basis of the Danny Kaye musical remake, ""On the Riviera""...3 1/2 stars (out of Five)

""The Gang's All Here"" (1943): Last of Faye's 'Golden Age' musicals, this legendary film is a Busby Berkeley extravaganza, so expensive that it got him fired from Fox! A wartime tale of showgirl Faye falling for G.I. James Ellison, which Berkeley largely ignored in favor of HUGE, sexually suggestive production numbers featuring Carmen Miranda, scantily-clad women, and giant bananas...This one has to be seen to be believed! 5 stars (out of Five)

A GREAT introduction to the career of a magnificent star!",1219017600,3,2715,5.359154929577465

2683818,5,B000K7VHMS,"There has been some dialogue about the disappointing  color of THE GANG'S ALL HERE.  All I had to do was press the tint and color buttons on my remote, and the color was gorgeous and astonishing as only Fox musicals are.  Don't take this movie seriously - - just sit back and enjoy one of the most colorful, fast-moving, and entertaining musicals of the forties with so many of our favorite performers.  The production numbers are astounding!  Alice was never more beautiful than in LILLIAN RUSSELL.  The closeup for Blue Lovebird with the black background against her blonde beauty takes your breath away.  Lillian does get somewhat bogged down in the last half, especially with the boring Weber and Fields routine, but it is a sumptuous picture and very enjoyable.  ON THE AVENUE is definitely Alice's film.  Her rendition of This Year's Kisses can't be beat.  The Ritz Brothers had talent, but it was never controlled and went over the top much too often. Alice gets a little feisty in this picture, and she's a kick.  Faye, Miranda and Ameche are all very good in THAT NIGHT IN RIO. The story is really delightful with Don playing a dual role.  Alice looks sexy and smashing.  Miranda was at her best in That Night in Rio, Week-end in Havana, and The Gang's All Here (the three films in which she appeared with Faye).  She was a delight until she became a caricature of herself in later films (even going blonde).

All in all a very satisfying package showcasing one of the foremost and loveliest singing actresses in the history of Hollywood.",1187913600,5,1547,4.677777777777778

2683820,5,B000K7VHMS,"This set is a very good compendium of Alice Faye's prime films from her prime era in the late 1930s and early 1940s. My focus here is on her 1940 epic, LILLIAN RUSSELL, a rather problematic film but not for those who understand that 1.) it's a musical, not a documentary; and 2.) as the author of the film's screenplay stated, ""My is purpose is to present Lillian Russell as people remember her, not as she really was.""  So what's the problem?

The real Lillian was quite a gal who apparently had had affairs with wealthy Jesse Lewissohn (try finding HIM on an Internet search) and Diamond Jim Brady (today his claim to fame is that the Johns Hopkins Urological Center is named after him). But William Anthony McGuire, who is credited with the film's screenplay (he wrote routines for Broadway producer Florenz Ziegfeld in the 1920s) cannily wove his story with a nod both to the film censors and to his insider's knowledge of Broadway in Russell's heyday. If you know what REALLY happened, you will realize that McGuire did a pretty good job of suggesting the events of that day.

For me, the highlight of LILLIAN RUSSELL is a short sequence near the end of the film by Lillian's real-life employers back in 1895 - Joe Weber and Lew Fields. They were a comedy team who began as teenagers in New York City's Bowery of 1879. Weber & Fields became their own producers by 1889, then began producing other Broadway shows by the 1890s. When they hired Lillian Russell in 1895, her career seemed on the downswing - she was not known for her comedic abilities. But Weber & Fields took a chance (while paying her lavishly) and Lillian reinvented herself on the music hall stage.

Weber & Fields initially parted company in 1904 when they disagreed on the types of musical plays they wanted to produce, but reunited in 1912 and therafter, while continuing to produce various shows independently of each other.

Remarkably, although all their contemporaries had died long before the film LILLIAN RUSSELL was produced in 1940 (Lillian herself expired in 1922, Diamond Jim Brady in 1917), Weber & Fields were still going strong in 1940 (although retired and living in Beverly Hills, CA).

The film's producer Darryl Zanuck contacted the team and they filmed one brief routine for the film in January 1940. That should have been the end of their involvement.  But Zanuck liked the routine so much, he invited them back and asked them to expand the routine. Zanuck set aside three days to film the expanded sequence.  Weber & Fields, by then in their mid-70s, filmed a total of four different takes in only three hours. The only retakes were due to laughter by the film crew - the boys were letter perfect in all four takes. It turned out to be their final performance.

The sequence is so rich that after watching it five times I'm still discovering lines and bits of business that somehow I missed in earlier viewings. One throw-away bit occurs when Lew Fields is shuffling a deck of cards - he tells Joe Weber that he was talking to David Warfield back stage (Warfield was a comedian in Weber & Fields' company who successfully managed to transform himself into a dramatic star on Broadway).  Fields says, ""Do you know what he said?"" Weber replies, ""I dunno - he wants more money?""  ""No,"" says Fields, ""He wants to play dramatic parts."" Admittedly, a viewer who never heard of David Warfield will make no sense of this dialogue.  Movie viewers in 1940 would have followed the conversation perfectly.  Many film critics in 1940 thought the Weber & Fields sequence was the best scene in the film.

To Fox's credit, a short bio on the real Lillian Russell is part of the bonus material, along with ""on the set"" photos of Joe Weber and Lew Fields taking their last bow a half century later. So this film is not a documentary! It wasn't meant to be one.",1180656000,,3837,4.640117994100295

2683822,4,B000K7VHMS,"To me, this is one of those collections where you win some, you lose some.

It gets my four stars for ""That Night in Rio"" and ""The Gang's all Here"", both epitomising the gaudy, sometimes garish, tuneful Fox musicals after they went into color.  ""Rio"" is actually a tour de force for Don Ameche and Carmen Miranda, but Alice looks and sings her best in an unusually sophisticated role.  Similarly, she's great in ""The Gang's All Here"", another splashy extravaganza given an extra kick by Busby Berkley's inventive and bizarre talents.  But to me, the most bizarre aspect of this movie is the inclusion of someone called Phil Baker, whom I gather was well known in radio at the time.  Radio is where he should have stayed.  On film, he has no impact, no looks, no charisma and no visible talent.  The other two movies in this collection get thumbs down from me.  ""On the Avenue"" comes over as a weak attempt at screwball comedy set to music, which is a pity as the music is good and even though Alice has a supporting role she gets the best Berlin numbers and sings them beautifully.  A pity about the Ritz Brothers.  Their so-called comedy routines are painful.  Which also goes for the attempt to re-create the comedy team of Weber and Fields in a long, boring sequence of ""Lillian Russell"".  It's unfunny, which is a shame, because if ever a movie needed a lift it's ""Lillian Russell"".  Despite the obvious opulence of sets and costumes, there's something depressing and funereal about this B&W film that cries out for color and vivacity.  The script launderised Russell's life, so if they weren't sticking to facts the writers could have at least lightened things up a little.  Alice plods through it, doing her best, but it's a mournful affair.  This is the trouble with some collections - they package the lesser with the best.  But in this case, the best is worth it for Faye fans.",1178323200,4,1886,4.615615615615615
2683830,3,B000K7VHMS,"This is a very nice set from Fox. After the dismal sales of the Betty Grable Collection, I was worried that Alice Faye's films wouldn't be coming out. Not the case. Fox did an excellent job with extras and the transfers look very good, except The Gangs All Here. It's really disappointng since this was such a vibrant Technicolor musical. The movie looks washed out and has a mustardy yellow greenish tinge. If you look at the restoration comparison, you'll clearly see that the Laser Disc version from 1994 was sooooo much better. They should seriously do something with this awful transfer and do a disc replacement. Shame on you fox.

I bought the set for 'The Gang's All Here'( my favorite movie musical) and 'That Night in Rio', I'm really more of a Carmen Miranda fan. However the other two Fay movies are absolute masterpiec and examples of Faye at her best. 'Lillian Russel' is a biography of one of the great ladies of the Theater during the 19th century, Faye is a revelation all by herself in that film! 'On the Avenue' is a rompimg, frolicing fun musical. Especially Impressive are the extra materials included, some of the best and most informative 'extras' I've seen. This box set is not to be missed for fans of Alice Faye or Carmen Miranda! You can exhale now. But I'm holding out for a Carmen Miranda box set all her own!!",1175990400,2,838,4.4480519480519485

Technicolor is especially important to this film.  What happened?

2683835,2,B000K7VHMS,"20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has been turning out some first-rate discs lately, exemplified by last week's release of ""The Mr. Moto Collection, Volume 2,"" the final release in the studio' Mr. Moto series. The Moto films, atmospheric tales of international intrigue starring Peter Lorre as a vaguely Asian adventurer, again look sharp, clear and solid in Fox's transfers.

But something has gone horribly wrong with ""The Alice Faye Collection,"" a four-disc set of Fox musicals including one of the studio's crown jewels: ""The Gang's All Here,"" Busby Berkeley's psychedelic Technicolor extravaganza of 1943. The original Technicolor separation negatives were destroyed in the 1980s at a time when Fox was trying to purge its library of nitrate film elements, and the movie was transferred to an Eastman Color internegative on safety stock. The Eastman material has since faded, producing dark, heavy tones. Fox's engineers have apparently made an attempt to brighten the colors digitally, only to have the pigments look flat and pale.

The results, as in the celebrated giant bananas number starring the unforgettable Carmen Miranda, are disappointing and even grotesque; those big bananas are a washed-out tan color rather than the original, eye-popping yellow.

The other films in the set - Irving Cummings's Technicolor ""That Night in Rio"" (1941); Mr. Cummings's black-and-white biopic ""Lillian Russell"" (1940); and Roy Del Ruth's adaptation of Irving Berlin's ""On the Avenue"" - look somewhat better, though ""Avenue"" shows serious print damage throughout.

But ""The Gang's All Here"" represents another great film lost, this time right under our noses. We, and the studio libraries, ought to know better by now.",1172016000,12,1718,5.4232209737827715
2683836,5,B000K7VHMS,"How wonderful to finally get a box-set of Fox's greatest blonde - Alice Faye - and for the first time ever on DVD .

Fox has been poor at its' DVD releases of the vintage gems concentrating on the ""obvious"" titles and their marketing is not nearly as strong as WB unfortunately who have shoved all the MGM musicals down our throat.

Let's set the record straight - Alice Faye and her Fox musicals were the biggest hits of their day - entertaining and unpretentious - enjoyable and touching. From about 1937 through 1945 Fox were the ""tops"" at film musicals with the theatre owners and public - far more modern than their rivals and with a finger on the public pulse.

Alice faye was the foremost female singer in the movies of her day and advanced pouplar song for female singers with her unusual , low , warm voice. She may not have been a ""great"" actress but she was very believable , convincing and sincere in every role she played and sold songs like no other ladies on the screen. Even Bette Davis admired Alice!

It really is about time that FOX started shouting about their marvellous musicals and stopped MGM grabbing all the kudos!

Come on now Fox , get some of the other gems with Alice Faye out there and in particular here in the UK which has never even had Alexander's Ragtime Band on DVD ! Co-ordinate your releases - make sure DVD shops have them in the right section and publicise their availability as many DVD collectors would love to have the FOX Blondes sitting on their shelves.",1170720000,11,1500,4.45985401459854
2683837,4,B000K7VHMS,"While the musicals of MGM are best remembered and most admired today due to Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Judy Garland and the production unit of Arthur Freed, it is worth remembering that Twentieth Century Fox were scoring consistent bulls' eyes at the boxoffice at the same time with their much less pretentious and more accessible blondes Alice Faye, Betty Grable and June Haver.  The first, and for some, the best of these blondes was Alice Faye and this DVD collection is a welcome addition to the Fox Marquee Musical Series.

Faye was an excellent singer with a natural but untrained contralto voice and an instinct for interpretation which made her the most popular  female ""pop"" singer in films of her era. She was the female equal of Bing Crosby. Composers clambered to have her introduce their songs and she launched far more standards than any of her contemporaries. She also developed into a competent actress with a trade mark modesty, vulnerability and warmth which captured the hearts of all, particularly men.

This collection contains 4 films all of which were Box Office smashes. The first two are in black and white and the last two in the garish technicolour for which Fox musicals became famous. All of the films benefit from Fox's trademark sound and photography, possibly the best in Hollywood. More detailed descriptions of each film can be viewed under the individual titles but by way of summary:

- ""On the Avenue"", released in 1937, has Faye supporting Dick Powell and Madelaine Carroll in a funny film whereby Powell's play lampoons the richest girl in the world, played by Carroll. Faye plays Powell's sidekick and carries her share of the excellent Irving Berlin songs, including the rollicking ""Let's go Slumming"" and the superb lament ""This Years Kisses"". The Ritz Brothers, the unsubtle trio who existed somewhere between the Marx Brothers and the Three Stooges, are on hand too and they are quite funny for once. The film was made not long after Faye was regroomed by Darryl Zanuck from an imitation Jean Harlow into a smooth performer with her own warm personality. Reviewers of the time suggested she stole the film, particularly as so many preferred warm and lush Faye to charming but cool Carroll.
- By 1940, with ""Lillian Russell"", Faye was the box office queen in the United States and the transformation from ""On the Avenue"" in 3 years is amazing. Now she is a showcased film star in a superbly mounted vehicle about the icon from the turn of the century.  Unfortunately, she is hampered by a lugubrious script, distorted facts and plodding direction so the film is heavy going. Faye herself, performs with great charm and sings ""Blue Lovebird"", a really beautiful song. She looks magnificent in the period costumes too but she isn't Lillian Russell.
- In 1941, Carmen Miranda was box office dynamite and the contrast of all American Faye with the Brazilian Bombshell in ""That Night in Rio"" contributes to the excellent entertainment. This film is one of a number which promoted the Good Neighbour Policy with South America although there is nothing which really distinguishes the sets from a glittering night club. The colour, costumes and musical numbers are spectacular with a particularly dazzling opening number.  Faye's role as a baroness is almost a supporting one and she is miscast but it hardly matters. She only has 2 numbers but one, ""They Met in Rio"" suits her deep throated and underplayed emotional delivery perfectly. Don Ameche plays a dual role and he is great fun.
- By 1943, Faye was happily married to Phil Harris and thinking of retirement. ""The Gangs all Here"" is an absurd period piece, a camp classic about a soldier and the two girls ""he left behind"". Faye grounds the madness with her knowing expressions but she balked at continuing her film career with such nonsense and this in fact was her last musical.  She delivers 2 great Harry Warren songs. ""No Love No Nothing"" resonates  with its war time lyrics. Carmen Miranda sings ""The Lady in the Tutti Frutti Hat"" which is completely mad and hilarious. Busby Berkeley's use of colour is notable, especially in the finale, but the number itself is endless.

The DVD set comes with some worthwhile extras including a pleasant and informative documentary split over 2 DVDs about Faye in which her daughters and biographer appear, one about the real Lillian Russell which serves to highlight just how much the film version distorts the truth and another about Busby Berkeley which is only OK.

The prints of the films have been restored but ""On The Avenue"" still shows signs of wear and tear and ""Lillian Russell"" has visible tears in it. The technicolour films, however, look very odd, especially ""The Gang's all Here"". It is much darker than expected, missing the dazzling colours which were its best feature, but you can use the brightness/colour/hue on your player to improve it significantly. Ironically, there is a ""before and after restoration comparison"" and this is one example when the bright ""before"" looks so much better than the dark ""after"", in spite of any dirt removed from the print.

""On The Avenue"" has an excellent commentary by Miles Kreuger. Kreuger has a particularly pleasant and clear voice so he is a pleasure to hear. He also has the ability to balance observations about the film nicely with biographical details about the players. In contrast, Drew Casper, the commentator on ""The Gang's all Here"", is hard to hear at times, frequently states the obvious and has a breathless and repetitive delivery which is very tiresome. He comes over as an overeager fan, not a articulate commentator.

The package includes a couple of deleted scenes, one of which, Faye's rendition of ""Chic Chic Boom Chic"", has never been seen before. Some of the trailers for the films are included and finally, there is a short film of Faye from the eighties when she worked for Phizer Pharmeceuticals.  It is great to see her looking so good, an ex-movie queen who managed to age gracefully,

The DVD collection is good value and its mere existence helps restore Faye to the exalted position she once held.",1167868800,42,6121,4.889103182256509

I cannot add any bio. or tech. detail about the actress or these films, so I merely note Leonard Maltin's reviews in his Classic Movie Guide&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leonard-Maltin-s-Classic-Movie-Guide/dp/0452286204/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide</a>&nbsp;and give my own brief impression.
Lilian Russell. LM calls this a ""strained bio."" and gives it two stars. It's in black and white, from 1940, and carries a disclaimer that this is the best print they could find. It's the only one of these films that seems chopped up and the only one I didn't watch all the way through.
On the Avenue. B&W, 1937. LM calls this a ""tasteful, intelligent musical"" and gives it three stars (the highest rating of the four films in this set). I'm inclined to agree. It's also full of catchy Irving Berlin tunes. Many reviewers say Alice Faye has an amazing voice, and I'm inclined to agree. Her singing style seems effortless and unforced, with her staring straight ahead. It's very compelling and refreshing after so much overdone singing in so many musicals.
That Night in Rio. Technicolor, 1941. LM calls it a ""Standard Fox musical of mistaken identities,"" awarding two and a half stars. Perhaps so, but I found it rather decent and amusing. After all, aren't all of Wodehouse's novels the same story? Yet the endless variations are endlessly compelling. And Carmen Miranda is a ball of fire. Don Ameche plays his two roles rather well as well.
The Gang's All Here. Color, 1943. LM calls this a ""visually dazzling wartime musical"", and gives it two and a half stars.
Well-packaged with four one-sided discs in individual snap cases in a box set, with individual four page booklets on each film, and extras (most of which I didn't watch). There's also a second box set, this one with five Alice Faye films (see my review)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-Faye-Collection-2-Rose-of-Washington-Square-Hollywood-Cavalcade-The-Great-American-Broadcast-Hello-Frisco-Hello-Four-Jills-in-a-Jeep-Full-Chk-Gift/dp/B0018RKEQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice Faye Collection 2 (Rose of Washington Square/Hollywood Cavalcade/The Great American Broadcast/Hello, Frisco, Hello/Four Jills in a Jeep) (Full Chk Gift)</a>",1404691200,,2515,5.912087912087912

8154800,5,B000K7VHMS,"The movies were extremely fun and an excelent family entertainment. ""The gang is all here"" is a three-star propduction but Alice Faye's performance made up for it.
The other movies were really outstanding, and I wish I were a native American speaker so I could find words to do justice to  Alice Faye's magnificent performance in ""Lillian Russel"". Now I know why it is said, ""It was her favorite movie.""
I highly recomend her collection to anyone who likes musical, fun and great acting.",1369267200,,487,4.7976190476190474
