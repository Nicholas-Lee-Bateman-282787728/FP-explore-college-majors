5345100,5,B009KTJFTE,Susan Hayward was a perfect fit for the movie.  I have almost all of her films.  I wish she could have lived longer.,1363046400,2,116,4.0
5345101,5,B009KTJFTE,"After years of waiting for this DVD release I can honestly say the wait was worth every minute of it. The print that was used for this transfer is immaculate in every way, a terrific presentation in it's original widescreen (scope) format of 2.40 to 1, stunning Metrocolor and a crystal clear sound track. Have not seen the film since it's cinema release in 1962, except for a poor 16mm letter box print in the early 70's. Susan Hayward is one of my all time favourite actors and along with Peter Finch, Dianne Cilento and Cyril Cusack with great direction by Robert stevens, the Liverpool and
New Brighton locations are fascinating. This truly is a great movie produced at MGM's British arm at the studio at Boreham Wood. You will even overlook the scene in which the Dianne Cilento character is playing her LP records at speed 78. The Warner Archive collection are to be congratulated on their video on demand system allowing us to add such
gems as this to our collection.",1359849600,14,974,4.635838150289017
8542613,4,B009KTJFTE,"Pretty good movie, with a few slow and confusing areas.  Perhaps I need to watch it again to understand how the father got the pill bottle from the top of Susan Hayward's character's dressing table and just why he killed his own daughter; seems an inappropriate father/daughter relationship was implied along the way, or so I thought.  Also confused as to just how Susan's male companion died from the medicine she gave him, or were these explanations excluded from the plot.",1486166400,,475,4.851851851851852

8542622,3,B009KTJFTE,Not considered as one of Susan Hayward's better movies during the early 1960's.  The story lacked suspense.  But seeing Miss Hayward in color made up for the story impact.,1397865600,2,171,4.862068965517241
