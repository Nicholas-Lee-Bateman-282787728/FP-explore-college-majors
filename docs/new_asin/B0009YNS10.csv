8070487,5,B0009YNS10,Sweet movie; I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. Enjoyed seeing some familiar faces from past TV shows. William Sanderson and Marla Gibbs are both very good. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie.,1454716800,,215,4.538461538461538

8070489,5,B0009YNS10,"We have loved this movie for a long time, but have only had a fairly poor quality edition of it.  It's great to have it on a nicely restored print, with greatly improved sound as well. Buy it!",1329436800,,192,4.052631578947368
8070490,3,B0009YNS10,"I love independent features, and especially love movies on artists and musicians.  I find these movies inspirational, couple this with my interest in the ukulele, this was an automatic purchase.

Given that, this is a difficult movie for me to classify or state an opinion on.  I do like the plot; the storyline is ""ok"" not great, but ""ok"".  And I do really like most every character in the film.  But I do not like the lead character.  I tried to like him, and every time I think I can get past a situation in the film, another one pops us.  Out side of the character flaws (emotional immaturity, habitual liar, emotionally bordering on physical abusiveness) there are inconsistencies concerning other aspects of this guy as well.

On the ukulele music, it is well done even though the film goes back and forward between accepting the uke as an instrument and showing disdain for it, some purposefully, some unintentionally through song selection.

As an aside and further inconsistency concerning this movie:  William Sanderson (who plays the lead, Stanley) is not even listed in the ad here at Amazon.  I'm not sure what that means, but usually the lead/star of a film is listed in its description...

In short, it is a movie that interests me for multiple reasons, but irritates me when I watch it.  I really want to like it, but can't.",1273708800,2,1340,4.6995708154506435
8070491,5,B0009YNS10,"My now deceased mom bought me a ukelele when I was a boy, but I wasn't the least bit interested.  Yet, Stanley brings more than his ukelele to the nursing home ... he brings a loving heart and patiently helps a former jazz singer out of a deep depression to sing once again.  The music in the film is superb and the acting never once overshadows the story.  In an age when people seem to only want action, sex and violence, it's wonderful to watch a movie that focuses on what really counts in life: genuine kindness and selflessness.  I am now a fan of the ukelele and have understood why mom wanted me to learn to play; she would have truly loved this film.  It's not cut out for younger audiences, yet for those who have tender hearts, Stanley's Gig is a real diamond in the rough.",1198281600,4,784,4.27027027027027
8070492,4,B0009YNS10,"Wow! I ordered this as soon as I was notified of its availability on DVD. I saw this late at night on cable and loved it; great mood, concept, and just-right performances by all involved. But I was never able to find it and thought that was that. This is good news; this movie is a real find.

Stanley is a ukelele player who takes his art seriously; he takes a ""gig"" playing for old folks at a nursing home. Eventually he gets more and more involved with the patrons and

the result is a pleasant, life affirming story in the vein of ""Driving Miss Daisy"".

I don't know the names of the principal actors besides Ms. Dunaway, but Stanley is played by the guy from the 2nd Bob Newhart series (the one with two brothers Darryl) and the other main character used to be Florence from the Jeffersons. Excellent portrayals, a happy/sad and sensitive movie you will enjoy time and time again.",1127001600,10,885,4.41717791411043
