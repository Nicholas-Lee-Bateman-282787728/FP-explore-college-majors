5726291,5,B00CM0C2M0,"How much did I love this show when I was a teenager? Answer: a lot. Along with Animaniacs and Pinky & The Brain, Taz-Mania was a part of my weekend routine as my teenage self didn't want to grow up.

Honestly, a lot of cartoons aren't as good as I remembered them being (looking at you, He-Man), but this is still just as funny and great.",1394323200,,338,4.121212121212121

5726293,4,B00CM0C2M0,"While Im wildly delighted to finally be getting Taz-Mania on DVD, I have
to admit Im a bit disappointed, or more properly dismayed by this second
volume of the series. Like Volume one, this is a two disk set with 13 episodes,
But its a bit of a puzzler. Volume one was pretty straight forward having
episodes; 1-14, (missing only #8) pretty much in their proper order. However here in volume
two we have disk one with episodes; 18, 19, 21, 22,23, 34 & 37, and disk two with episodes;
38, 17, 33, 39, 19, 15, & 42. Is it just me or are these episodes
increasingly random? Worse yet the missing episode 16 was the first of the
delightfully goofy road picture series featuring Tazs uncle Drew!

  Theres still about three more volumes to go at this rate, so its not
too late to fill in the gaps and tighten up the series before we get to the
end. So lets have the rest of this great series, please!",1384473600,7,895,4.252941176470588

5726295,5,B00CM0C2M0,"I don't believe it, before the first volume was released Warner Home Video had very early announced that they're releasing a second volume for this show in August this year. WOW! I guess after most of the collectors have bought the last volumes of Animaniacs and Tiny Toons, and the first volume of Duck Dodgers (which vol. 2 is coming out in July), they decided to immediately release more volumes of their 90's animated TV shows on DVD (but where's vol. 2 of Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries? Huh? Don't stop, continue releasing more DVDs of that show). Here's the DVD content:

Disc 1
*Amazing Shrinking Taz & Co.
*Oh, Brother/Taz-Babies
*Jake's Big Date/Taz Live
*A Midsummer Night's Scream/Astro Taz
*Tazmanian Lullaby/Deer Taz/A Bonus Taz Moment
*The Outer Taz-Manian Zone/Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty Part II
*Tazmania's Funniest Home Videos/Bottle Cap Blues

Disc 2
*Hypnotazed/Mum's n' Taz's
*Boys Just Wanna Have Fun/Unhappy Together
*Food for Thought/Gone to Pieces
*Kee Wee Cornered/But, Is It Taz?
*Mall Wrecked/A Dingo's Guide to Magic
*The Man from M.A.R.S./Friends for Strife

Check it out when it comes out. I highly recommend it for those who want to get more volumes of this show. I hope Warner will continue releasing more DVDs of Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries someday in the future (as well as bringing out more volumes of Tom & Jerry Kids, and release its spin-off shows Droopy, Master Detective on a complete DVD release).",1370822400,9,1437,5.029411764705882
