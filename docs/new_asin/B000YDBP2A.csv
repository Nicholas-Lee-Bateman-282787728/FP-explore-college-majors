to Starbucks and out to cracker barrel..... this guy
has that Don Knotts awkardness... even they way
he drinks his beer is funny... the roof is
on fire and so is JR.... the bonus footage
is funny as the boat ramp bit",1208908800,,272,4.25
8231856,5,B000YDBP2A,"I love this DVD.......saw him on tour opening for a country band, and had no idea he had gotten a record deal! Sweet! Great DVD, the part about Alan Jackson is hysterical....you'll have to buy it to see what I mean....So much better than the other comedians out there working the rural fanbase. Got this and the Godfrey DVD, a great way to cheer up a lousy day! See these guys at the clubs too, I think they both tour all the time.",1207699200,,431,4.204819277108434
8231857,2,B000YDBP2A,"Wow.  This guy is filled with energy.  He was on the verge of being funny a number of times.  I hate it when comedians apologize for jokes or content of jokes...just go for it.  If it is offensive, so what?

The part where he rubbed his stomach could have been hilarious if it had lasted only a few seconds instead of what seemed like forever.

He could be funny if he polished his act.",1205971200,,386,4.148648648648648
