Refreshing entertainment in this day and age!",1461456000,,154,5.2
8230051,3,B000XUOLOI,"Nice, cute movie. Typical God is missing story with a few different elements. Matt Keeslar is always delightful in any show or movie he does. He is the reason I wanted to see it.",1354838400,,178,4.264705882352941
8230052,3,B000XUOLOI,"I only bought it because IMDB wrote James Roday (my favorite person on the planet) is playing in it, but after I watched the movie I found out he's not in it. Still - it's a cute movie and I liked it.",1315267200,,200,3.7857142857142856
8230053,4,B000XUOLOI,"There's a lot to like about Thank Heaven. The concept is absolutely charming - God sneaks around Earth playing golf, but gets a concussion from an incoming golf ball and forgets who he is. There are some funny moments, particularly with God's assistants. However, Thank Heaven's concept is dragged down by its blatantly ""made-for-TV"" level of acting and production quality. None of the characters seem as lovable or deep as they should because the acting just isn't there. It doesn't ruin the movie, but it does take away from its emotional power. Overall, I'd give this 3.5 stars.",1299024000,,581,4.938775510204081
