7807626,3,6300252337,"I've seen my fair share of blacksploitation movies, and I typically like them for the most part. Not this one. While I wouldn't necessarily call The Bad Bunch a bad movie, it's not exactly enjoyable either. I understand the entire point of the film is to display crazy racial tension... but the levels of hate and intolerance go way overboard. It makes it extremely hard to like or sympathize with any of the characters. Almost all the tension in the plot revolves around false accusations and misunderstandings. Again, I'm sure that was the point of the film itself, but I found it frustrating to watch.",1507852800,,604,4.761904761904762
7807627,1,6300252337,"This movie is TERRIBLE! One of the WORSE blaxploitation films I have ever seen! It starts off with a black dude dying before the credits roll. *SPOILER ALERT* The only good thing about the movie is that it ends with a white dude dying (with artistic emphasis on the white guy dying). But the white guy they killed was really cool, and I grew to like the character played by Greydon Clark. I would have been fine with just the police getting killed but no... they had to kill the coolest white guy in the whole film for no good reason at all. Therefore I conclude that this film is TERRIBLE!  Absolutely HORRIBLE!  TRULY AN EXAMPLE OF: WHEN KEEPING IT REAL GOES WRONG!!",1495497600,,668,4.4227642276422765

7807633,4,6300252337,"The movie shows it age, but the whole movie does show the tension. You look at today and you see that it is all still there, but covered up better. White man who has a black buddy in 'Nam who gets killed. He goes to  the ghetto to inform the father and runs into the brother's gang.  Like I  stated before, the movie shows its age, but i do think it helps the younger  generation realize the way it was....and still is.",930009600,3,419,4.073170731707317
