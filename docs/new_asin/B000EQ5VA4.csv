2528742,4,B000EQ5VA4,"This novela was the first teenage soap with the season's format in Mexico... the executive producer is the same from Rebelde..Pedro Damian... the original story is from Colombia and it called ""Francisco The Mathematician""... in this novela we see some of the actors from the succesful novela ""Rebelde"".. Dulce Maria, Alfonso Herrera, Cristian Chavez and other teenage actors... Anahi (Mia on Rebelde) doesn't appear in this dvd,.. she came to the show until the 3rd season...

this novela is very different than others soaps.. all the characters are in a dangerous gang,.. Francisco is one of the teachers who take care of these unrestless kids... the soundtrack its good,.. all of the actors of Clase sing the songs

..very good Novela,.. if you like Rebelde you love Clase 406",1144886400,12,778,5.023255813953488
2528743,5,B000EQ5VA4,"When it first came out, I loved this Telenovela. I couldn't wait until its DVD release. I was not disappointed. This DVD walks through the complete season rather elegantly. It is a single run of all the major events that lead the to developing of the story. It's very enjoyable and just as good as the first time. Since the DVDs are only a bit over 10 hrs. the show may seemed rushed at times; until you realize how much was covered on its first season. Overall, a fantastic buy that is very enjoyable to watch.",1142899200,5,511,4.333333333333333
2528834,2,B000EQ5VA4,"I purchased these dvds to help my spanish and watched two episodes but haven't seen anymore as the storyline is brutal!  IN the first two episodes someone is raped, another stabbed and someone goes to the clinic to check if they have an STD.  This is a high school drama!  It was a bit heavy for me....",1280448000,3,302,4.2631578947368425
2528835,1,B000EQ5VA4,"It is with great sadness that I have been writing about this item.
Actually do not know how the item is, because when he arrived was damaged in shipping the DVD's released from the box and scratched altogether.
I believe the dvd's are good, but the product is not well-conditioned box.
Indico when making a purchase request to enter some thing inside the box to separate the dvd's to prevent damage and can not watch the dvd's

2528836,5,B000EQ5VA4,"There are some telenovelas that we don't see here in Brasil, like Clase 406. So when I saw Alponcho Herrera in the casting, I didn't though 2 times, I surely bought! And liked very much. There are many scenes that I couldn't understand, and many micro stories that I know I left, but I loved!",1251676800,,292,4.327272727272727
2528837,1,B000EQ5VA4,"This movie's more about kids who get into trouble than a great romance movie.

The main teacher character (Alejandra Barros) is much better in the movie MARIANA DE LA NOCHE (which I would rate as 4*).

The best romance soap is LA OTRA.",1245369600,,235,4.441860465116279
2528838,5,B000EQ5VA4,"It was worth it buying this DVD. Some details or moments important ar lost here, but still very good. If u want to enjoy some real teen problems and situations buy this. On my opinion better than Rebelde.",1222214400,,204,4.394736842105263
2528839,5,B000EQ5VA4,"this is a good novela for the young heart.it is a story about some teenagers that are in the same class.it focuses on each character's issues, love, hate and life. it was very different than the typical Cinderella story novelas i was always use to....",1207785600,,251,4.6
2528840,5,B000EQ5VA4,ok so i watched this when it came out...i was about 13 i believe. and i have never ever found a novela that covered so much of your average teenage latino's everyday life. it was like looking into a mirror. so the things they do are sometimes ridiculus but guess what? it happens and on a daily basis. i think this is the best teenage novela ever made and i cant wait for the next seasons to come out on dvd. tatiana is the best...even though she was not really important in the first season,1203292800,3,491,4.178947368421053
2528841,5,B000EQ5VA4,I LOVE THIS NOVEL!!!!I;VE ALREADY SEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND SEASON AND I LOVE IT!!CAN'T WAIT FOR THE THIRD AND FOURTH TO COME OUT!!!!,1169683200,,133,4.583333333333333
2528842,2,B000EQ5VA4,"The characters in Clase 406 are ridiculous. I think I hate all of them. Their actions seem like the cause of bad parenting... but the parents you do see don't seem bad at all. Most of them are selfish.. and self absorbed. When bad things happened.. I was happy and ready to turn off the DVD. They deserved their misfortunes for being so ridiculous. I was stunned by the professors obsessions with his students-- and the students drinking while at school functions??

I purchased this DVD because I enjoyed Rebelde. It had it's silly moments, but the characters seemed to grow throughout the show. The characters in Rebelde were selfish on occasion and looking out for others at other times. I did not find that in Clase 406.

I am not a native spanish speaker, but I'm learning through books-- and these dramatic telenovelas. I purchaed my first telenovela, Piel de Otono, and loved it and was looking for something new to watch so I could pick up on a few new phrases. (I don't recommend this approach to a beginner in Spanish). Anyhow-- this set of dvds was a waste of time.",1166054400,6,1076,4.569948186528498
2528843,4,B000EQ5VA4,"I bought it and think its great. Alot of important things we're convered after edited, although the music was cut out and i was alittle disapointed on how much they actually cut. Some parts you can just notice we're missing, but in all it's good and worth purchasing. I cant wait till the second one comes out.",1147564800,3,310,4.456140350877193
8113071,3,B000EQ5VA4,"Picture quality is not that great, but it is an old show. Also, DVD skips in some areas or freezes. While I like the show, I don't believe it's appropriate for showing in an educational setting (I'm a Spanish teacher).",1507420800,,218,4.475
