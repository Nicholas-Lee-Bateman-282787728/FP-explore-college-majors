8037819,3,B00063F5OC,"I want to first start by saying that I am a huge fan of the Lopez family.  I cheer for them everytime they fight.  Though many dislike the family, no one cannot deny their tremendous talent for the sport.  I bought this recently to see what it's all about.  The videos are advertised as ""cutting edge"" material (it came out in the early 2000's).  Jean Lopez states that some of these techniques have not been used in the late 80's-90's.  However, after viewing the content of the videos, I believe he's mistaken.  All of the steps, kicks, and drills demonstrated in the tape have been around since the early 90's thus making none this content new.  The only difference is that they used different names for the techniques and steps.  I find it ironic that the title of the series is called ""Cutting Edge,"" yet most of the content is pretty basic and well-known.  In fact, the only 2 techniques that are ""cutting edge"" are the lead leg back kick (which is slow and a prime catalyst to destroy your knees) and the lead leg 360 roundhouse (again - no power, slow, and horrible on the knees).  If you're interested in these, let me give you the pros:

Volume 1 - Though the content is basic, the commentary and insight from the Lopez's is worth while.  Not to mention, the feint and elite steps are excellent (though they're not new).  Lopez's are excellent at cutting the angles for kicking - this was a great video!

Volume 2 - Opens ups with more advanced kicks.  This one wasn't as impressive.  In fact, they repeat the same advice for every kick (i.e. keep a tight knee, maintain a good center of gravity, snap the kick, keep a tight spinning motion) - though this is important, it would've been nice if they actually broke down more of the mechanics and or application tips.  Mark Lopez has some of the most beautiful and dynamic spins ans spinning techniques I've ever seen!  I wish they would have shared more.

Volume 3 - Introduces some speed drills on the paddle - not bad overall - some new ones that I like - good progressions - very good footwork drills

Overall, this series was produced to cash in on the hype of the sensation Steven Lopez.  There are some good tips mentioned throughout all three videos.  However, if you want a ton of kicking content plus drills, get the Taekwondo Training in Korea DVD by Sang H. Kim (it's only $10).  But if you are a serious competitor and or collector of TKD vids, get this.  I love the Lopez's - they're some of my favorite athletes - so this was a great collector's item!",1327017600,2,2525,4.460698689956332
