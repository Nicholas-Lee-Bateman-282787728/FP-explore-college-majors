8024169,5,B000297NM2,"I had seen this product when it was recommended to me by a fellow guitar player. It is at a basic level which is what I needed and where else to get it than at Amazon.

I would recommend the product and Amazon to anyone considering Bluegrass guitar.",1403222400,,249,4.1875
8024170,3,B000297NM2,"The DVD seems OK, but I have not spent much time with it yet.  However, on the cover it says ""Music and tab enclosed"", but *nothing* is enclosed except the DVD.  I saw reviews here that said something about having to download a PDF - from instructions on the DVD.  I could find no such instructions after an hour of so of searching, so I called Homespun.  The lady I talked to there was pleasant and helpful.  She first said it was a PDF file on the DVD, but no such file exists.  Then she said there should be a slip of paper in the case with instructions on downloading it from their website, but that didn't exist either.  Finally she just emailed me the PDF.",1364947200,,662,4.2063492063492065
8024171,5,B000297NM2,"Who or what defines beginner or intermediate? I've no idea!
Like all my Kaufman purchases there is again delight and satisfaction with the product. This basic bluegrass and rhythm DVD includes instruction for six pieces: Down in the valley* Wabash Cannonball* Blackberry Blossom** New River Train*&** Sally Goodin** and Soldiers Joy**.  *=lyrics and **=additional variation(s). He's arranged these pieces so you can play it very basic or with some flavor and even a fair splash of spiciness by the end.
The instruction is done  with Cowboy chords. Left and right hand instruction given, as in what is your right(or left)hand doing? This is what and/or how your left (or right)hand should be moving.
Steve has also included detailed visual and verbal examples for pull offs, hammer ons, walk ups, walk downs, and Lester Flatt runs. (I should probably be embarrassed but I've no idea who Lester is. Great runs though!) Well explained for an eager novice to bluegrass. Discussion for band etiquette, avoiding monotonous repetition, muscle memory and speed tips are covered as well.
The DVD includes instructions for printing off the music from a PDF accessed by your computer. The font is small for my middle age eyes but we can adjust for this. The PDF sheet music shows tab and chords. NO DIAGRAMS FOR CHORDS> Get over it. While most of the chords are common, Steve has really gifted us some unique chords to flavor the last couple pieces. As always he is both pleasant and thorough in his instruction.
So, can you can move from cowboy chord to cowboy chord without diagrams and fairly easily at that? Are you ready for spice in your strumming? Are you wanting advanced sound to your basic chords? Looking to add variation to multiple measures of same chord? Yes? Buy it! Money well invested for a self defined moderate to advanced beginner.",1345507200,6,1840,4.913183279742765
8024172,5,B000297NM2,Steve is a great guy to get lessons from. He explains things really well. On occasion it goes a little fast for my ability and he assumes you know basic things about the guitar.,1264032000,3,177,4.235294117647059
8024173,5,B000297NM2,"This is everything a bluegrass guitar lesson aught to be. The pace is good, the explanations are clear and easy to follow, and there is a good amount of material covered.

If you are new to guitar or just new to bluegrass and want to get the basics, this is a great place to start. If you are experienced bluegrass picker, it may be a little too basic. It does start off with tuning and basic chords, but progresses quickly to walking base and various lead-ins and transitions.",1205884800,6,477,4.420454545454546
8024174,4,B000297NM2,This DVD is a good introduction to basic Bluegrass rhythm guitar. I do wish it was longer.,1202428800,3,90,4.352941176470588
8024175,5,B000297NM2,The video has good camera work and good sound.  The songs covered are basic but it is a beginning video.  Steve is a good instructor.  The printed materials that come with the video (stuffed in DVD case) are somewhat weak.  I had to expand them on a copier so I could read them.  The actual notation is just fine.  I would recommend this video to a friend.,1105574400,15,356,4.2388059701492535
