8609853,5,B00EVIOX3C,"Claudette Colbert was one of those rare Golden Age Movie Stars who got great roles as a woman, and when she didn't she out acted the male lead every time. In ""Torch Singer"" She did her usual, reducing me to tears with her sensitive portrayal of the woman with a beloved illegitimate child who she can't through circumstances keep. A bit of a hurried ending, ten minutes more to tie up loose strings to the story would have satisfied me. But despite that, well worth giving this very early movie a viewing. I'll watch it many times more. A lovely clear print as well.",1411344000,4,566,4.451923076923077
8609854,4,B00EVIOX3C,"I bought this movie for my mom who is 93. We talk about old movies when I visit her and she really enjoys watching turner classics. One day,she mentioned this movie and how much she had liked it when she saw it when it was released. But she couldn't remember ever seeing it again on tv. So this was my easter gift to her and she really enjoyed seeing it again.  Now it is my turn to view it. I'm sure I will like it also.",1399507200,6,421,3.895348837209302
8609855,5,B00EVIOX3C,"It is a fabulous film with a heartbreaking storyline. Claudette is, at once, charming, witty and tough. It was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. Her singing
was an added surprise and she rarely was given this opportunity in other films.
It is a winner!",1395705600,4,261,4.822222222222222
8609856,5,B00EVIOX3C,"My grandfather was a HUGE Claudette Colbert lover. When he died, in his tool chest was a photo of her as well as a photo of my mother. I never knew my grandfather but after seeing Claudette in ""Midnight"" I saw what he saw and immediately became a huge fan. I now own all her movies that are available on DVD and I must say, I loved this story. Claudette was a miracle in taking any movie and running with it. If you are a Claudette fan as well, you know what i mean. Torch Singer is a great movie!",1389830400,3,497,3.98
