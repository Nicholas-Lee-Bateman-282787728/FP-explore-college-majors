Instead its more a documentary, that explores how the Hilltop Hoods operate as a band; how ideas are conceived, how videos are made, how tracks are recorded and how they ended up making The Hard Road Restrung (with all its complexities).  City of Light by itself becomes its own living breathing beast as you get candid interviews from Suffa, Pressure and Debris interlaced between live performances and music videos. Its done in such a way that even moderate fans can appreciate the level of work and love they put into a project.

The high point of the album is when Hilltop performs Breathe Restrung, its simply a flawless performance that belongs in the walls of hip hop hall of fame.

Its easy to see how the Hoods (independent artists at that) manage to sell 200,000 copies of their two last albums in the age of the death of CD sales on a single continent to a country of only 20 million. This makes them one of the most successful indie bands in the world regardless of genre. Strangely they've yet to break and be embraced stateside but it probably is only a matter time if they continue making music in their fashion, intelligent, dope and fresh. Suffa and Debris as a tandem production team are blessed, Suffa and Pressure trade rhymes back and forth in a way that's reminiscent of the golden era.

There's one thing maybe fans may not realize is that Aussie hip hop seems to be in the stage of evolution much like 1988-1993 (or 94) US hip hop, pre-complete commercialization of the art where talent is rewarded, pre-bling bling, pre-club sounds. Its a time that most American hip hoppers consider the pinnacle of Hip hop that artists like  Public Enemy, KRS-One and hi, Eric B. & Rakim, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest flourished along with crossover artists and gangsta.

Included on the DVD as extras are four music video, the Adelaide Center concert with the Adelaide Orchestra (In 5.1). This warrants a purchase, if alone for the concert that might be the best live performance ever, on the same level as when LL Cool J broke the mold with MTV unplugged, Dave Chapelle with The Roots, Mighty Mos, Talib and company torn down NYC or when A Tribe Called Quest rocked an entire crowd to the point of exhaustion for MTV.  After 17 years of hip hop listening, its good to see the rest of the world serving up hip hop with the same energy and authenticity as their North American counterparts.",1208131200,,2568,4.693333333333333
