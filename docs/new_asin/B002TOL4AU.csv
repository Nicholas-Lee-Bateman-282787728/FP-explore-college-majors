3985570,3,B002TOL4AU,"I'm not sure what they are doing when they slap together the entries for the Warner Archives Collection, but it is insulting to pay a premium price for something that I can watch on TCM and discover that the quality isn't any better.
The print is old and dirty. There are no chapters. You can only move scenes in 10 minute increments. The sound quality is mediocre. For what it's worth, I might just as well DVR this movie straight off TCM and save myself money.
All of this is a shame because NORA PRENTISS is one really good film. Ann Sheridan does what she does best.....sizzle intelligently and convincingly. Kent Smith delivers a great performance as a doctor making some ill-advised and life altering changes that lead him down a path to ultimate disaster. This film noir offering deserves a new audience, but not looking like someone had left it in a dust collecting cannister slowly rotting.",1280707200,11,899,4.69620253164557
3985571,2,B002TOL4AU,"This is a top notch noir from Warner Brothers that has been issued on DVD-R. The only extra is a trailer in this case, and as in all other Warner Archive entries there are no chapter stops - you can only go forwards and backwards in ten minute increments.

The above paragraph is my standard disclaimer. When I first started playing the film I was somewhat disappointed that a post-war title such as this would have the same so-so contrast and scratches that the early talking film Archive entries had, but I could have lived with that. What makes this unacceptable is that the film periodically freezes and pixelates. At one point the DVD stopped playing entirely. I tried several other players and I got the same result. At first I thought it was just this particular disc, but over at digitalbits the review for this disc indicates that the reviewer had the same problem I did leading me to deduce that at least a batch of the DVD-R's for this film are defective. At such a high price this is completely unacceptable.

I've been waiting for Nora Prentiss to come out on a pressed disc as part of the Warner Noir series for three years, and it's inconceivable to me that such a fine film should receive such a lack of respect in its treatment. If you get a chance to catch Nora Prentiss on TCM, please do. It is the odd tale of a married San Francisco doctor (Kent Smith) who fakes his own death in order to run away to New York with singer Nora (Ann Sheridan) without having to confess to his family that he wants to leave them. Later the doctor is involved in a car crash that leads to plastic surgery that completely alters his appearance. Unrecognizable as his true self, the police of San Francisco follow a paper trail that leads them back to the now renamed and refurbished doctor - and he is promptly charged with his own murder.

In short, I highly recommend this film, but stay away from this product until the manufacturer defects are addressed.",1260403200,21,1958,4.49438202247191

8380429,4,B002TOL4AU,"This is a tight little film about suburban ennui as  a well thought of doctor experiences and realizes he's on life's treadmill when he treats and subsequently falls for Nora Prentiss, a sexy singer in a second rate club. The doctor is hooked and loses himself in the tawdriness of an affair.  He neglects his family and work as his obsession grows. He arranges a nefarious plot to enable them to leave town.  Being a film noir he couldn't get away with his behavior and the ending is jarring.

Ann Sheridan is HOT as the singer who gets involved with the good doctor.  She is gorgeous, but OMG those hats the studio makes her wear...just awful.  And Kent Smith?  well, he's a bit wooden in this role, but hang on for the ride. Robert Alda is absolutely smarmy as the guy who has loved Nora for some time now, but I don't think that was his intention acting the role.

My only complaint, like others before me, is the quality of the dvd.  Mine also froze several times.  And I had to turn up the sound to75% to be able to hear the dialogue.

Other than the hats and quality of the dvd this is a really good movie for noir fans.",1496016000,,1127,4.268867924528302

8380432,2,B002TOL4AU,"The working middle aged white guy who begins to chafe at the bordeom of the same old, same old day in, day out.  The femme fatale who lures him into trouble. It's been done many times, and done very well... think 'Scarlet Street,' or 'Double Indemnity,' or 'Pitfall' for starters.

The trouble here is it isn't done very well. For starters, Ann Sheridan just doesn't have femme fatale written all over her and, in fact, other than some vague allusions in the course of conversation to her supposedly wild life, all we see here is a rather tame, somewhat witty young woman who longs to be married, who happens to fall for a married man, and who sticks with him through thick and through thin, sacrificing all for his well being no matter how bizarre and self-destructive he becomes. If anything, she's a victim of his strange obsession, hardly the manipulative gold digger/black widow. And in any event, thinking one could cast perky Ann Sheridan in the role of 'black widow' was a blunder of major proportions.

As for the plot, it's simply too jury rigged, too implausible to hold any real interest. This movie was doomed by its casting and screenplay before it got off the ground.

Watch the three films just mentioned above, then watch 'Nora Prentiss.'  If you have a pulse, you will quickly understand this film is not remotely in the same league; an Ann Sheridan is a long ways from Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Bennett and Lisabeth Scott when it comes to playing bad, bad girls. It's not film noir; it's just plain odd.",1464307200,,1519,4.652985074626866
