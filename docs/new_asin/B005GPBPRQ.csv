8472044,3,B005GPBPRQ,"Exact same footage, and unfortunately horrible narrator, as the film by Kate. There are a couple of parts that are different, and better done. If you must watch one, watch this one. Watching both is a redundant waste of time.",1493424000,2,225,4.65
8472045,4,B005GPBPRQ,"I enjoyed this documentary and would recommend it to others, but with a warning that the Narrator could teach a master class in the subtle art of shade.",1486252800,,152,4.464285714285714

8472050,2,B005GPBPRQ,"This documentary talks to people like Andrew Morten and an astrologer who used to work for Diana. That let's you know how much quality is in here. William comes off as spoiled rich boy sowing his wild oats while Kate is a blank slate sitting in the corner waiting for him. Quite shallow imo and detrimental to both parties. There are times when the narrator seems to have no linear story to tell and jumps from one topic to another without any real transition.
This documentary will give you the cliff notes shallow version of William and Kate, but I would definitely look elsewhere to get a deeper more meaningful look at the couple.",1403308800,6,634,4.5701754385964914
