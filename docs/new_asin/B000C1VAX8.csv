8095075,5,B000C1VAX8,"This is the second volume of the series of Shadow Skill. If you have seen the movies then you will recognize certain aspects of the show as the movies were just made from certain episodes (or vice versa, I am not sure). Shadow Skill is a great series for those who love martial arts mania. By this I mean the very unrealistic style of martial arts which is a common element of many anime. The story follows Elly Ragu and her adoptive younger brother Gou Ban and is primarily about Gou's growth as a warrior.

I highly recomend this series to anyone who loves anime or not-so realistic martial arts flicks. If you are not one of these people, I suggest trying something else.",1184112000,,674,4.435483870967742
