7513447,2,B017RR7420,"Wasn't exactly what I expected.  The movie was just okay.  I think acting could have been a little better.  Seemed like a Lifetime movie, not one you would pay for.",1459209600,2,164,4.4
7513448,5,B017RR7420,"If you like stories about very intrepid and resourceful women, then you'll like this.  The main character was almost a superhero which I found very soothing.  She never gave up and saved the day.  I hate the kind of stories where the women scream attractively and fall down because they are wearing high heels.  Or they stand cringing while the male hero is being clobbered and they don't do anything to help him.  This heroine put up a pretty substantial fight mentally and physically to extricate herself and her daughter from a pretty daunting predicament.  Her daughter was no dummy either-- yay for her too.",1458864000,2,612,4.780952380952381
