8520930,5,B007Q0JIK0,"Loved this show, regret there were not more seasons.  Think Superstore based on this but this format/cast were better!",1486771200,,118,5.2105263157894735
8520931,5,B007Q0JIK0,"Best improv series ever. It's so light-hearted, but awkward and fun. The characters are all delightful and the actors are just fun to watch. Jon Lehr and Bob Clendenin are my favourite and the rest of the cast work so well together. Great, feel-good show that makes you nostalgic for small-town grocery stores, is very funny, and just fun to watch.",1461974400,,348,4.721311475409836
8520932,5,B007Q0JIK0,"Surefire way to cure what saddens you. I've watched this show many times and it always makes me smile. Like most things great, gone way too early.",1448496000,2,146,4.444444444444445
8520933,5,B007Q0JIK0,"What a wonderful, simple, from the heart show. It is improvised, it is funny, quirky and heart warming. I've watched it on netflix, and knew I had to own it. Like Firefly, and Dollhouse, all the good ones go....
John Lehr, you are genius. He reminds me of Steve Martin, who, if you recall, not only was a great comedian, but also bestselling author, award winning screen write and academy award winner. An over-all talent, is what I compare and correctly so, I say. Correctly so. Watch for him alone and then fall in love with everyone else. You will, I know you will.",1412121600,3,568,4.471153846153846
