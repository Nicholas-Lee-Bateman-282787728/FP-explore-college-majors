4126957,5,B003IJQXJ2,"""Long Pigs"" has all the makings of an instant cult classic with a fresh and original story, great acting, and all the gore and intensity you can handle.  From the moment I sat down with my pad of paper and rolled the DVD, I was hooked. I was so involved in the film that I had to watch it a second time just to prepare for the review and interviews.  The characters are fresh and realistic, the storyline follows events so realistic that you'll swear that what you've seen has actually happened.  The special effects are above and beyond anything that you would expect coming into an independant film, these guys took great pride in their work and shows.  Bottom line, if you want to see a good, original film from a great filmmaking team, ""Long Pigs"" is exactly what you're looking for.",1272758400,3,787,4.4825174825174825
4126958,5,B003IJQXJ2,"This is what independent horror filmmaking is all about!!  Long Pigs is the story of two struggling filmmakers who happen upon a cannibalistic serial killer who gives them full permission to document his life and ""practice.""  This is filmed as a real documentary might be filmed, giving it a degree of authenticity.

Our killer Anthony, played by Anthony Alviano, is deceiving.  At first you think Anthony is the result of really bad miscasting by writer-directors Nathan Hynes and Chris Power.  But then you realize what Hynes and Power are doing:  They aren't going for a Silence of the Lambs or Se7en rip off here.  They're telling the story of a killer who is the ""everyday guy""; the guy you play hockey with, go out for a couple of beers with, and who holds down a job and has friends.  The story is tight, well-paced, and has excellent and realistic dialogue.  There is also some really good editing going on here (by Chris Power); he intercuts footage of Anthony, a police officer they interview (convincingly played by Shane Harbinson), their interview with a criminal psychologist, and radio host Tony Prince (Roger King).  Through creative editing Hynes and Power juxtapose the characteristics and traits of ""standard"" serial killers with those of Anthony.  This is how we come to realize that Anthony isn't your typical killer and why he's eluded the authorities for so long.

Anthony doesn't kill for sexual release, out of anger, because he was abused as a young boy, or because he has ""mommy issues"".  Anthony kills because he likes to eat human flesh.  It's that simple.  As Anthony himself explains,'""This is all just culinary.""  He's a rational, intelligent, everyday kinda guy who approaches his murderous activity with a level head and even has an entire ""cannibal philosophy"" he lives by.  Depending on what he wants to eat that night, he'll kill a particular kind of person.  We join him as he hunts for the perfect body type to make stew (a fat prostitute).  He explains that he doesn't even enjoy killing or cleaning the bodies.  It's just a job that must be done.  He approaches his work the same way you and I would approach making an omelet; it's no different from cracking eggs.

This may all sound like it's played for dark humor or even camp, but Hynes and Power play this straight and it works (I was shocked to see that bloody-[...] calls this a horror-comedy.  It's clearly not).  The success of Long Pigs (the title comes from the term human flesh is given on the Marquesas Islands in Polynesia) rests solely on actor Anthony Alviano's shoulders.  He hits all the right notes as the rational killer.  It doesn't even seem like he's acting here; he's a real natural.  The dialogue feels ""real"" and not forced; it actually sounds like something a real person would say.
There are two notable scenes here:  The first is when Anthony and the filmmakers take a tour of a pig farm and slaughter house.  This really makes you think, ""Is there really a difference between slaughtering pigs and humans?""  But it's the second scene where things take a chilling turn:  Anthony talks about the one time he killed a child (a 7 year old girl) just because he wanted to see how young flesh tasted compared to older flesh.  He said it was a onetime deal because killing a child draws too much attention and he doesn't wanna risk it again.  The filmmakers then decide to interview Merle (Paul Fowles), the father of the girl Anthony killed and ate.  They even bring Anthony along and he poses as the boom-mic operator.  It's a powerful scene watching Merle plead for the return of his daughter as we see Anthony in the background.  You'll get chills running up and down your spine as they are leaving and Anthony shakes Merle's hand.  You'll need a shower after that scene.
Once aspect that I would've liked to have seen examined in more detail was the relationship between Anthony and the filmmakers.  They filmmakers clearly cross the line and are accessories to Anthony's criminal acts.  But we never delve deeper into this relationship.

And the f/x?  I was really surprised how well-done the f/x are considering the modest budget.  You can see this is a very low budget flick, but Hynes and Power manage to present some fantastic f/x.  In one scene we watch as Anthony hangs, bleeds out, and then butchers one of his victims.  Very realistic looking!!  It's no wonder; Chris Bridges did the f/x.  You've seen his work in 2004's Dawn of the Dead; 2006's Silent Hill, Saw III, and 300; and 2007's Dairy of the Dead.

Long Pigs is one of those indie horror finds that don't come around too often.  From the acting and dialogue to the cinematography and special f/x, this is a winner.  It's gotten some well-deserved exposure at festivals winning several key awards (""Best Picture"" at the Moving Image festival in Toronto; ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Actor"" at the Mockfest festival in L.A; and ""Best Horror"" at the International Horror & Sci-Fi Fest in phoenix to name a few).  Check this one out; it'll make you re-evaluate your neighbors!!",1272240000,6,5056,4.748564867967853
4126959,5,B003IJQXJ2,"I have seen the movie twice. On DVD and in the theater and it held up in both cases. Originally, I received the DVD from the distributor and watched it - I loved it. It was fun, quirky, disgusting, I thought well done and different. The cast was very talented - Anthony, the cop and the doctor all very believable and enjoyable. The prosthetic effects were very well done. My hat is off to the film makers Chris Power, Nathan Hynes and Special Effects Artist Chris Bridges for a well made independent low budget horror movie.

I do believe LONG PIGS has the ingredients to become a cult classic and is a worthy addition to any horror fan's film collections. Get Long Pigs - you will be pleased.

AND just so you know I had the opportunity to interview Chris Power and Nathan Hyne for my program Rex Sikes' Movie Beat ""Conversations with Filmmakers"" -  you might want to hear the filmmakers discuss Long Pigs as well. Available on the internet at my website and at the itunes store as podcast.

When I saw the movie in the theater numerous viewers stood and applauded the film when it finished. I was shocked to see that, but it points out that it was well received. I enjoyed it the second time, as much if not more, having watched it once on DVD, interviewed the filmmakers, and then saw it in the theater.

As I mentioned... it held up. It was quirky, fun, funny, sick, disgusting horror entertainment. Enjoy Long Pigs.",1272240000,2,1421,4.471042471042471
4126960,4,B003IJQXJ2,"Two young directors film the hunt and butchering of a prostitute by a local cannibal serial killer. This is interspersed with footage of a grieving parent, a psychologist and a detective. How will the story unfold?

There are some minor complaints to be made. For example, the cannibal (Anthony Alviano) seems younger and nerdier than expected, which took away some of the realism. The same for the police officer (Shane Harbinson) -- seemed very young, but presented himself very professionally. A fine actor, he easily could have passed for a real cop.

The radio DJ (Roger King) was the strongest and best-written role. His words were well-scripted and well-spoken, and the way his scenes book-cased the film really worked well. The film would have been good without him, but this pushed it from good to very good... perhaps almost great.

I appreciate the argument made that ""how can it be wrong if it tastes so good?"" This is reasonable. God or nature has made edible things palatable -- we learn what to eat by whether or not our taste buds enjoy it. If man was created tasting good, something would seem to be supposed to eat it. Why not other men? (There are moral questions here, of course, but at the very least, why do we not eat the flesh of those who have died?)

More than anything else, I have to call attention to the very good use of effects on the corpse... very, very good. The body contained skin, flesh, meat, guts, bones... I do not know how this was accomplished, but it may be the greatest corpse effect in movie-making history. I believe this honor belongs to Chris Bridges, who has been involved in the field for over a decade on a number of notable projects.

I would endorse this film. It is an interesting faux documentary, and with the work of Chris Bridges, it may have you doing a double-take. Did they use a real body? It is almost too difficult to be sure.",1272240000,3,1890,4.579881656804734

If you are a fan of horror movies, this is the the breath of fresh air that you have been waiting for.

Please don't waste your time & money on those cookie-cutter remakes that Hollywood keeps pumping out.  Long Pigs is the way of the future, and I'm hungry for more!",1272240000,5,583,4.198198198198198

4126976,3,B003IJQXJ2,"This movie was good for an indie film, but I'm not sure why all the five star reviews.  It was definitely different, dark and funny, but way too predictable and the entire premise that this would even be a remote possibility for even the most desperate struggling film makers was way too hard to swallow.  No pun intended.  Also, the social commentary that it was forcing down your throat was way too obvious and made it feel amateurish.  The acting was good especially Anthony Alviano and did a good job walking the fine line of almost understanding his detachment.  The comedy was witty and was thrown in at the right spots and gave you relief and kept you watching.  All in all it was a good indie horror/mockumentary, but maybe my expectations were too high because of all the five star reviews.  Not for the weak and not for everyone, but definitely different.",1387584000,4,865,4.61437908496732

4126978,5,B003IJQXJ2,"Wow.
First of all, the acting in the movie is terrific. A lot of the script seems like it's improvised, which works well. Essentially, you're hanging out with a cannibal willing to tell you all his secrets and show you the tools of the trade. There's a bit of gore, and more than a few parts that will makes you cringe. While it is a bit disturbing, it's interesting; you're never sure where it's going to go next. The ending is by far the best part.
I'd recommend this to any horror fan.",1372204800,,488,4.258064516129032

I do think the storyline was original and that's what got me to rent this.  WHAT A MISTAKE.  I could even sit through all of it because I felt myself losing brain cells with each passing minute of this ridiculous waste of time.  I do NOT understand the high ratings.

This comes off more like a film school project from people with a couple of friends who were interns at a special effects company.

The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because there were a few genuinely disturbing moments that will be hard to forget.

If you're into the ""August Undergroud"" movement (poor/no direction, amateur actors, nasty-looking female actresses getting snuffed), maybe this will be up your alley.  If you're looking for a quality film, look elsewhere.",1335657600,,647,4.6902654867256635

This show's what it's like to be a real cannibal from start to finish...the ending doesn't really make much sense, but the begining and inbetween are pretty cool. The special effects are great, the characters are well portrayed and acted.  This movie is slightly below films like ""Behind The Mask"" as far as enjoyment and doing the documentary style movie, but it's still pretty cool.

4126996,4,B003IJQXJ2,"I'll echo others who praise ""Anthony"" for his performance.  I knew from the beginning it was well done, but it wasn't until I saw him actually have his character ""acting"" in the police interrogation scene that I knew how subtle and effective his performance throughout really was.

As a nod to the practical (special) effects of the bodies, I did have to hide my eyes during one ""butchering"" scene near the beginning.  It's one thing to see stupid teenagers getting an axe in an adrenaline-charged flight-scene with screaming and scary music.  It's another thing to see, well, I won't spoil it, but...that.  The later scene, at fast-forward and with a deviously modified little ditty from The Nutcracker, was more tolerable.  Nothing was played over the top.  The scene on the pig farm was just outright black comedy, in my mind.  I kept expecting to see a slaughter but again, the filmmakers pulled back and that ended up being one of my favorite scenes for its restraint.

What I found interesting is that I was more disturbed by the ""filmmakers'"" willingness to be complicit in Anthony's acts - as if they thought the camera gave them immunity.  Worth watching, certainly.",1309564800,,1175,4.85929648241206

4126998,4,B003IJQXJ2,"LONG PIGS takes the same Mockumentary approach to cannibalism as MAN BITES DOG had to the crime thriller. In it, a group of amateur filmmakers set out to document the life of Anthony McAllister, a modern cannibal and self-proclaimed chef, as he lures his newest victims into becoming dinner. While it bears a strong similarity to MAN BITES DOG, this dark comedy is no cheap imitation. Chris Power and Nathan Hynes have produced their own sharp and witty dialog that takes a bite out of the Horror genre. Anthony Alviano is both charming and charismatic in the lead, with a disarming personality that draws the audience into his depraved world. The funniest moments in the film are derived organically through Anthony's subtle performance and the casualness with which he describes his morbid activities. Less is more in this case, since many of the obvious attempts at humor (like the inclusion of ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" during a particularly gruesome scene) detract from the realism of the situation. Power and Hynes do give their documentary-style filming an increased sense of authenticity by conducting mic checks and by coaching Anthony on camera. Another impressive aspect of the film is how graphic and lifelike the butchering scenes are, since they are often indiscernible from reality. LONG PIGS comes as a big surprise in the Indie circuit, with an equal blend of comedy and horror that is sure to appeal to fans of MAN BITES DOG and BEHIND THE MASK: THE RISE OF LESLIE VERNON.

I was very impressed by both the acting and the special effects of this this little low budget indie horror.  It seems to be the riffing off the excellent Belgian film Man Bites Dog, but takes the documentary framing device a little farther than the slightly farcical Belgian masterpiece.

4127000,5,B003IJQXJ2,"This sounded like a pretty interesting Mocumentary horror flick but I admit I never expected it to be as good and entertaining as it was. Billed as a horror/comedy I got to say I didn't see much funny about it other then a few lines here and there that made me chuckle a bit but besides those I thought this was a pretty scary horror flick. Now when I say scary I don't mean like a slasher or ghost film might scare someone, instead Long Pigs provides it's scares through it's story and characters. This is a man who kills people for the pleasure of enjoying them for dinner, how much more horrifying can it get? The other scary part about this man was how he invited these two men with cameras into his home and allowed them to film his every move while being as polite as your next door neighbor is. To be honest to give away what happens in the movie just would not be right so I am not going to go into spoilers here. If you didn't know this wasn't a real film you would think it was that is how good every actor in the film is in portraying their roles, easily some of the best acting I have seen in an Independent, low budget film and I have seen my share of them to know. Real or mock doesn't matter much here because these talented film makers did a great job at showing just one of the many horrors that happens everyday and also providing some food for thought on the media itself and just how far or too far they go in covering our news. As far as the genre goes I am sure you can find others more bloodier but for over all content I don't think you will find many more frightening as Long Pigs. With the numerous awards the film has already won I am sure these talented film-makers know the kind of film they have create but I can add that I thought this was one of the most clever,well-written and disturbing films I have seen in some time and it left me not only feeling a bit uneasy but with a number of things to think about as well.

Yes, it's human beings on the chopping block.  Dark, gritty, and demented, this Clowns After Midnight production is bound to get under your skin.

Long Pigs is an all-too-real mockumentary on Anthony McAlistar, an affable cannibal without a conscience.  Anthony has allowed two young filmmakers full access to his life and his disturbing meal preparations.  Believe me, it is quite uncomfortable watching this monster work.  Partly because of his friendly disposition and his total disregard for human life.  Also because of the specific details he shares with you and the pride he takes in his work.  Anthony seems to enjoy the spotlight as the film captures his heinous deeds.  This also brings into question the moral disposition of the cameramen watching the crimes, plus the media's fascination with such atrocities.

Long Pigs is very well made, receiving several awards at different film fests.  The lead acting from Anthony Alviano seems almost too convincing.  Much of the script seems improvised, adding to the authenticy.  There is some brief nudity and a little bit of gore as the cook cuts up his fresh corpses for cooking.  Toss in the sloppy camerawork, scattershot direction, plus the quick and brutal murders and you have quite the sick little independent horror film.",1281484800,14,1442,5.124463519313305

8397420,5,B003IJQXJ2,"Truly great indie horror flick that flew way under the radar. Think Man Bites Dog + Behind the Mask + Street Thief, but with a charismatic cannibal as your murderous main character, and some gloriously morbid practical FX. Track this one down, it deserves a bigger fanbase.

It's the rare indie genre film that transcends its low budget with great main characters, witty humor, gore, and being engaging start to finish. Without spoiling any major plot points, an amateur film crew follows around a cannibal serial killer named Anthony McAlistar, documenting his murderous routine, and eventually find themselves lending a hand in the ritual.

One thing that makes the film so enjoyable is the main character, played by Anthony Alviano. His performance as serial killer / human flesh connoisseur Anthony McAlistar elevates a micro-budget faux doc to an entertaining indie gem worthy of repeat viewings. He's calm, charismatic, menacing, and kinda likable (for a guy who kills and eats people).

Another asset worth mentioning are the practical FX. In one scene, after dispatching a prostitute with a club, we watch McAlistar completely dismember the body like an animal in a slaughterhouse. It's brutal, unforgettable, and won't disappoint gorehounds.

In a more ""lighthearted"" moment, the film crew documents McAlistar as he gleefully prepares a pot of human stew in his kitchen. As he slurps a spoonful for a taste-test, he waxes poetic about the decadence of eating human meat. It's a clever nod to Hannibal Lector, giving the archetypal cannibal a hilarious ""foodie"" touch. Brilliant stuff.

Long Pigs is screaming to be rediscovered. Easily one of my favorite indie horror / found footage / faux doc flicks, I hope to see it garner a sizable cult following someday. Whether or not that'll happen, I'm happy to have a copy in my collection.",1461628800,,1843,5.1096345514950166

8397425,4,B003IJQXJ2,"It took me awhile to figure out if this was a real documentary.  The characters were so natural and believable. I love this kind of movie and think it has the makings of a cult classic if its not already. One cannot expect another ""Exorcist.""  It's pretty great for this genre and I would recommend it.",1420070400,,302,4.375
8397426,4,B003IJQXJ2,"Honestly, it's almost like an actual documentary (as advertised) about a cannibalistic serial killer and the two amateur cameramen... Within the first 60 seconds and for the rest of the movie I was able to suspend disbelief and believe this one - and I am a pretty harsh critic of microbudget c-horror movies.",1417132800,2,309,4.849056603773585
8397427,4,B003IJQXJ2,"Two documentary makers somehow discover a cannibalistic serial killer and decide to make a documentary rather than turn him in. They follow Anthony (Anthony Alviano) as he non-nonchalantly kills and eats people. Anthony breaks the mold for a psycho-path. The film was rather amusing in a dark kind of way. The ending clues you in that the whole film is a metaphor for how the media feeds off the misery of people, just like a cannibalistic serial killer.

The film includes a talk radio, Howard Stern sounding guy, someone who feeds off of misery (Roger King).

8397428,4,B003IJQXJ2,"Was pretty good. The effects were good, the acting was good. Just don't eat while you are watching this movie since it is a ""found footage"" that has to deal with cannibalism.",1412640000,,174,4.46875
