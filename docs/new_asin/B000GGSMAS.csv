8131998,5,B000GGSMAS,"After all her hard work, Yurie is getting better at her new job of being a goddess. She meets an old man that served in WWII. She decides to bring the Battleship Yamato back to it's home port in Hiroshima. The problem is that the Yamato has been at the bottom of the Ocean for 40 years. After solving that issue, Yurie runs for student council chairman. She should be a shoe in for the job, but she doesn't like to make speeches. Yurie's brother, Shoukichi, runs off with Miko from the shrine. This gets everyone into a panic. And Yurie also has to transfer to another school for a month in preparation for a god festival. She never gets a break.

This is the best volume yet. I like the show more and more after every episode. This is a great, and low key anime for just about everyone. I think it's geared more toward girls, but I think that everyone will find something to love about this cute little show.",1356912000,,909,4.284883720930233
8131999,5,B000GGSMAS,"Yurie has gotten a bit more used to being a god than in previous volumes, and for the most part she continues to hear prayers and help people. But she's still on a learning curve when it comes to differentiating between what people want and what they NEED. If gods answered every single prayer, then humans wouldn't do anything for themselves. Even other spirits ask Yurie for aid. For example, the spirit of a fishing boat travels to Japan because the soul of the great WWII battleship Yamato wants to go home. School is a theme of two other episodes on Volume 3, one earthly and one godly. Yurie runs reluctantly for student president (pushed by Matsuri) and learns that even a god has to compete with a rival candidate! Then she transfers to another school for a month to be close to a god convention and finds it's hard to make friends. The last episode on the disk deals with Matsuri's cute little sister, Miko, who runs away with Yurie's brother. Yurie and the others think they might have eloped!

Kamichu is a passionate and gentle rendering of what would happen if a good-hearted person became a god. I really love the characters on this show because none of them ever give in to their darker urges (except Matsuri slightly). Over emotional content is kept to a minimum and instead the writer focuses on how humans can be helped without resorting to a welfare state with Yurie at its apex. I think it's cool that even though Yurie has all these powers, she still wants to live a normal teenager's life, attending school and falling in love. The voice acting is great and the animation is feature film quality. Awesome show!

If you like this show, check out the anime Ah My Goddess! For an opposite take on this theme, I would recommend the Death Note manga.",1165363200,,1767,4.553459119496855
