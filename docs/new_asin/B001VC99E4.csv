Season 4 continues it's examination of the science and crimes that are used to safeguard our loved ones and to seek justice once our loved ones have been violated.

For those of us that don't ""Want to Believe"" in the CSI series popular on TV now this is a breath of fresh air.  The entire series is informative, and entertaining.  They go behind the scenes and look at the actual people behind reality CSI, and unlike CSI Miami, NY or Las Vegas the crimes are hideous and messy.  Crime science isn't carried out in a 40 or 30 minute time slot, it carried out over months and years ""The New Detectives"" does an incredible job of condensing much of the time without leaving out pertinent information and without minimizing the dedication that the law enforcement's, crime lab technician's, and prosecuting attorney's effort sweat, tears and drive that's required to solve the case's profiled.  While the interviews are done after the crimes, sometimes by many years they bring real life faces to the crimes and to the police we rest so much of societies defense upon.",1255737600,,1259,4.598214285714286
