8241824,2,B0011FLGVU,"It doesn't matter how much or how little footage you watch, once you get past the narrative, which could be read in any summary in a print or online source, you will find that well more than half of the video used is used again and again and again.  I am sure that the producers did their best to cover this important theater of action, however, they started with an enormous handicap: Gen. Douglas MacArthur.  It seems the general made certain that all news reports coming out of his theater were carefully screened to focus on him.  So one can easily understand the lack of actual front-line footage, especially since Gen. MacArthur did not visit the front while fighting was still occurring.  If this is read by fans of Gen. MacArthur, I do apologize for any upset.",1393804800,2,768,4.583941605839416
