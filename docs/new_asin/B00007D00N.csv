1806126,5,B00007D00N,"I'd been hearing alot about this interactive DVDs and this one is not kidding.  The instruction is simple, but the 60 minutes workouts are tough, but I figure I will build up to that, thank God there is are different increment workouts starting at 10-minutes.  What I found extremely helpful was the way the instructor Maggie Rhoades takes you through a step by step instruction with variations for many of the poses at may be challenging especially for a beginner.  So far so good and I can happily reccomend.",1131062400,44,510,4.707865168539326
1806127,5,B00007D00N,"I have been looking for a good beginners pilates tape and this is the one.  It was part of a set that Gaiam makes that included a book, the DVD, and a relaxation CD.  The combination of the book and DVD are absolutely unbeatable!  Both begin by describing the basic tenets of pilates and accompanying exercises.  Then the DVD has  modified beginners, beginners and intermediate to advanced work out levels, where each level  is represented by an individual who is working out simultaneously with the persons representing the other levels; i.e.  three people at once doing different levels.  The modified beginner can be programmed separately from the main work out if desired.  The instructor explains all things in detail in both the book and DVD--perfect for the novice.  (MOre advanced people might get bored, but this is what I was looking for)  The instructor's credentials are listed in the book; she has studied with Romana and thus her lineage is sound.  I think this DVD/book combo is a real find!!",1127433600,13,1007,4.858823529411764
1806128,3,B00007D00N,"Okay, Pilates is complicated, posture is very important along with breathing and holding in some body parts while extending others.

 I did weights for years and was just sick of them. I went to a Pilates studio just to check it out. I signed up for private sessions for 4 months, it was fantastic but, very expensive. I was forced to stop most exercises for 3 months after an injury. So, when I put this DVD on it was like starting over. But, I thought it would all come back to me. And, it did sort of.

 Even though I think this DVD is informative I found the instructor a bit annoying as I hated every level quickly blurted out for each exercise. After being in a Pilates studio with private instructors I discovered there are very small movements to concentrate on and form is everything so, with 3 levels being done at once I found it very distracting.

 I don't think this is a good way to start out again. Or start out at all. I am now looking for DVD's that show each level of instruction separately. Believe me, paying for 3 great videos is better than one video with everything crammed into one. I bought this DVD because it said , ""Pilates for BEGINNERS"" if it's for beginnners then why did someone decide to have the instructor blurt out levels 1, 2, 3 for each exercise at the same time? -( ANNOYING.

 Pilates is much more complicated than weights and if you want to do it right it's a big commitment, which I don't mind making. There are so many things to remember and then forget ..to feel like a private instructor is in your living room I think a slightly slower pace with better visual and verbal queues would be much more useful and informative and effective.

 Bottom line is that mat workout felt like a bad, 3 way phone conversation.

1806129,5,B00007D00N,"I am surprised at the other reviews, as I thought this DVD was great! It was the first one that I tried, and maybe That was why I enjoyed the in depth instruction. I thought it was great that there were 3 different levels included, and I thought that jillian hessler was a triffic instructor. The props used really do help to isolate the proper muscles and since buying them I have enjoyed my workouts even more. This DVD has even prompted me to buy more of the Gaiam series! I love the outdoor locations and soothing music ( I think that that is why they are not smiling, they are focusing on their breathing and centering...I found it to be quite relaxing and soothing.)
I am a real beginner, and feel good in the fact that I can take this one product and advance through it to the advanced level.
It gets an A+ from me!
PS- I also had no technical problems...maybe they have fixed them since the last reviewers bought theirs??",1088467200,20,929,4.344827586206897
1806130,2,B00007D00N,"First off, Jillian does a _great_ job describing proper positioning and breathing; however, the workout section was so boring that I couln't even finish the session.  They all look bored, themselves.  No smiling, no apparent energy or passion for what they are doing...just stone cold faces and almost robot-like movement through the few and low-repetition exercizes.
I also don't at all like the info-mercial aspect to the Gaiam DVDs...the instructors always seem to recommend some prop to aid in doing some move rather than describing what muscle groups are supposed to be used to help control the motion naturally.
This DVD is dull and uninspiring",1085961600,13,650,5.180952380952381
1806131,5,B00007D00N,"I started Palates last year with the ""Beginning Mat Workout"" with Anna Caban.  It was great.  I came across this DVD a few months back and decided that it would be nice to have two DVDs so that I can alternate, rather than watching the same one over and over.  This DVD is a bit easier than Anna's, but great just the same with three levels to follow.  I have moved on to the intermediate DVD with Anna Caban and I hope that Jillian Hessel considers putting out an intermediate DVD as well.  Oh, one more very important factor, this DVD has an actual MAN performing the exercises with Jillian.  As a man myself, it was very refreshing to see that Pilates is not just for women.",1058400000,72,677,4.291338582677166

1806167,4,B00007D00N,"I purchased this video to do with my teen daughter, who has gravitational insecurity and dyspraxia, which manifests in her as delayed gross motor skills, low muscle tone, bad posture, and inflexibility. The first time we tried it, I jumped ahead to one of the yoga/pilates leg workouts, which was a mistake as it was long, and too hard for her. A few months later I convinced her to try again, from the beginning. It was just challenging enough for her, without being impossible. It works for us to do each workout 5x/week for 1 or 2 weeks before moving onto the next. The workouts seem to build on each other, so I suggest starting at the beginning.
The video isn't as polished as the cover would have you believe and it takes a couple of times to really understand the instructions, but its worked well for us and has improved our strength, posture and range of motion.",1426204800,3,871,4.518987341772152

Plus you get your money's worth as the DVD has a bunch of routines.  I love that it also offers express/quick routines.  I think this is probably best for beginners and those with injuries, as well as inflexible people.  The pacing may be too slow for more advanced or injury-free people.  It doesn't seem to accelerate my heart rate like some of the more fast-paced and rigorous  pilates DVD routines.

1806213,1,B00007D00N,If you are a person who is not flexible and think this DVD will get you there then do not bother.  It is just a slower version any other Pilates/Yoga video.  She does not provide ideas on how to become more flexible or show how to become more flexible she just does the moves that all other videos do at a slower pace.  If I cannot bend in half fast I cannot do it slow either. Maybe her definition of inflexible is based on a provisional yoga instructors view of inflexibility and not on normal people.,1403481600,5,503,4.21875

1806215,1,B00007D00N,"Dreadful.

I'm annoyed because I took this DVD out of the library a few years ago, but the cover photo isn't the instructor or the set of the dvd, so I didn't remember it as the dreadful video I had previously tried.

The instructor is clearly dubbing her own voice over the video. The words and her mouth don't always line up. The set is ugly, she speaks too slowly to feel any sort of progress. Meanwhile, in the segments where she's moving at a quicker pace (and all the segments) there's this awful canned ""work-out video music"". It is so bad, I can't take it.

I do Pilates with an instructor when I can afford it. I was hoping for something I could follow along with at home that would also remind me of the modifications I need to do for my flexibility limitations. This DVD is not the solution.",1397088000,3,802,4.298013245033113

1806218,3,B00007D00N,"I guess anytime I do this much research before a purchase I have high hopes for the DVD. But I give it a B- . The DVD is only a 'C' in terms of music, setting and lip synching to voice instruction (thank God there isn't much of that in the DVD; only in the initial 'principals of pilates' portion.). Where this DVD excels, is that there are modifications for beginners in the classic poses. AND they are GOOD modifications. However, it moves from pose to pose quickly without quite as much attention to instruction on form/where the effort should be located/etc. AND the DVD doesn't allow for good navigation amongst poses. As the instructor says, you need to *pause* the DVD to review the previous posture. So, i will use this in conjunction with what I have found to be the BEST book on Pilates by Brooke Silers. Together, they will make a good team to really kicking off a quality practice. Hey, if I'm gonna take the time to build abs, it better be time well spent.",1395187200,,969,4.418994413407821
1806219,3,B00007D00N,"Maybe I am just used to attending Pilates classes where there is a little more going on, but I found this video to be extremely boring.  I am definitely a beginner, so I do not think it was the poses that were boring me.  I think it is the amount of time it takes for the instructor to describe each pose.  I felt like I was left hanging while I waited for her to stop talking.

The video does have multiple segments to choose from categorized by the area you are working on and the amount of time the exercise will take, which is great.

The instructor keeps saying ""scoop your abdominals"" which just doesn't sit right with me.",1394496000,,628,4.243697478991597

There is only one exercise in this that's NOT on the floor.  I went through all the chapters, but they all seem to be the same, except for that one standing up.

I don't know anything about Pilates, but it doesn't seem that the entire Pilates exercises would be on the floor.  Surely there should be some that don't involve being on the floor?

I don't see the point of having 7-8 chapters that are reruns of the first one.  If you buy an exercise DVD, there should be a variety of exercises.",1393372800,4,649,4.095238095238095

I did not see any movements that seemed to be modified towards increasing flexibility.  Basically, the moves were the same as the ones in my old tape - that was disappointing.  I can not do any of the exercises that have to do with being on my knees or sitting back on my heels - there were quite a few of these and I feel that I won't get the full benefit of the program by leaving any exercises out.  It is a wonderful dvd for people with no limitations, but, as I said previously, I did not see any exercises that would take inflexibility into account.

I am very pleased with this purchase and will buy the other DVD FOR YOGA for Inflexible people once my back issues are solved.

Other reviewers have mentioned the glacial aspect of the presentation. I agree with it. I found myself wanting to move faster, or at least faster than the pace of a poky pony! And yes, the background/setting is dark and reminded me old New England houses now used as yoga/pilates/arts centers with tons of darkwood, etc. Margaret is likable enough, but her style did not click with me.

Cons: The exercises are waaaay to slow, even for beginners (i.e. it takes forever to teach one posture or movement).
It is extremely boring. The explanation is way too long to the point it is hard to hold the pose while waiting for explanation to end. I wish they just taught what to do all at once and allow the viewers to check themselves as they repeat the movement.

Overall: This DVD is quite boring, that I didn't even wanna try again after the 1st try.",1340928000,3,629,4.277310924369748

I was hoping this DVD was just a little bit more for beginners than the other DVDs I've purchased, and I certainly liked the idea that this DVD offered choices in workout lengths, from just a few minutes to longer ones. For me, though, the exercises were not the least bit challenging, and when I decided to try to group several together, I found that I often had to repeat exercises I had just done. I think the introduction was informative, especially for people who have never heard of Pilates. The exercises, too, might be really good for people who are not only brand new to Pilates but brand new to starting a DVD exercise program.  For those who are even just a little familiar with Pilates and the exercises involved, I would recommend starting with something a bit more challenging, such as those by Ana Caban and Brooke Siler.",1336003200,7,974,4.502824858757062

There are a number of different ""tracks""/workouts to choose from...full workout, arms and abs, legs, etc.  The various workouts are of different lengths with the targeted workouts being 10 to 15 minutes each. I've tried varying combinations of the shorter, targeted workouts and been disappointed by the number of repeated exercises.  I had hoped the a la carte selection would a good way to build my own ""full workout"".  Not so much.  The full workouts are good, but the other workouts have too much overlap in the exercise movements.",1334880000,,705,4.923728813559322

1806279,1,B00007D00N,"I have been using this DVD in my exercise rotation for a year now, and have decided to drop it.  I bought it because of the ""For Inflexible People"" phrase; I'm over 50 and have tight hamstrings and lower back, plus I have practically no sense of balance (I fall over easily).  I've tried yoga in the past and failed miserably (see ""tight hamstrings"", ""falls over""), and I really thought this DVD would be the answer.  Yeah, well . . .

Having tried all of the workout sequences on the DVD multiple times over the past year, my main objections are 1)the routines move at the pace of a drugged brontosaurus, 2)many ""workout"" segments seem to involve rather a lot of sitting/lying still (I actually prefer to contract muscle tissue during my workouts), and 3)I don't ""feel it"" during or after the workouts - no sense of having actually worked any muscles.  Ok, maybe this was supposed to be one of those ""relax and stretch"" DVDs, but that's not what I do Pilates for.

And I do have to say I find Maggie Rhodes annoying.  She talks . . . too . . . slowly . . . while . .  explaining  . . . poses, plus uses (to me) nonsensical phrases like ""anchor the hips firmly"" - I'm sitting on my butt - how do I ""anchor"" anything more ""firmly""??

After watching it, I think they meant that if your inflexible, buy this DVD because you won't have to move much.  Through most of the video, she's barely moving!

If you follow the instruction, really focus on the muscles and your breathing, you can get a stronger mid section and get flexibility in less time then you think.

Along with the pilates there's also a yoga section.  The yoga is at the same level as the pilates, modified for the inflexible.  I hate to admit that these workouts were challenging for me, that's how inflexible I am.  But they were achievable and I started seeing the improvements within a few weeks.

""Put right hand on right ankle, left hand on right knee."" with enough time to get into the position before taking you back and forth between the legs with more than enough time to do it.  The pace is easy to follow for me.  Later on the more advance section, the set-up is quicker and the repetitions are increased.  A real good way to learn.

The rest of the DVD was simple stretching. The only other exercise that attempts to really work any muscles is a leg exercise that just made my hip and ankles hurt.

If you have any prior experience with yoga or pilates and are in moderately good shape, I'd recommend Pilates Abs by Ana Caban (which I purchased after this one), Power Yoga by Rodney Yee or Yoga Shakti with Shiva Rea.

The instructor who demonstrates the Pilates is solemn and wooden, as is the woman  who does the voice over. ""Pilates Complete for Inflexible People"" doesn't seem to have one thing, specifically, to do with inflexibility.  I'm 61, active, and in great shape (size 6 jeans), but I'm getting some stiffness in my calves and thighs, as well as my shoulders, so I was really eager to get this one, but when I tried the very first set, I was already wondering what this had to do with specialized moves for inflexibility because they're some the very same moves I was doing at the fitness center where I exercised with people from 18 to 80, only much more repetitive, and full of incorrect transitions that could actually do harm if you follow them through.

Always the optimist, I thought, ""Well, there's a lot more to this DVD than that little bit."" So, I began opening other segments, and they're all the same moves. I do know that there are hundreds of Pilate moves and positions, but this instructor seems to have gotten hold of 3 or 4 moves and made a career on them. They seemed more aimed at my stomach muscles than areas of inflexibility. I wanted a routine that would stretch and limber up my whole body,one that might be a little challenging in the beginning but that I could work up to, but that's not what I've got, and the whole setting with its dark, forboding background would have been depressing if I'd stuck with it much longer. There is nothing challenging, helpful, or inspiring about this DVD, and I would return it, but I got it here at Amazon.com when it was $9.99 w/ free shipping (I luv Amazon.com), and it would cost almost that much to return.

I also thought the instructor look bored and not enjoying herself. How can you be excited about working out if the instructor isn't?

For starters, the idea of exercising with a video is to give you the feeling of being in an exercise class.  But Maggie Rhoades video created the feeling of distance with her voice over technique as she is performing the exercise routine.  Also, her voice and the routine are a little out of sync in places.  It also drives me crazy how she keeps switching sides during the leg exercises instead of completing the series on one side.  She has zero useful form cues.  I guess thats the difference between someone who is an expert in a particular form of exercise and someone who has superficial knowledge, apparently enough to produce an exercise video.  As an example, she doesn't have any instructions for finding your balance or setting up for relatively challenging exercises such as rolling like a ball with the legs outstreched.  And this is supposed to be a beginning video. With many better pilates videos in the market, why invest in this one?",1245196800,37,1054,4.721311475409836

I loved karate but it killed my knees and was rough on my body because I just plain lacked the flexibility it requires.  I'm not old or overweight and to look at me you'd think I'm in good shape.  Fact is, I can't reach my arms overhead and keep them straight and I can barely reach past my knees.  I've been using this DVD for 3 months and it has been exceptional.  The easier sections isn't for people who want to want to improve on their average flexibility, it's for people like me who will be thrilled to just make it to average.  The next section is a bit more.

Maggie Rhoades has designed a really unique program of modified Pilates that addresses the needs of the flexibility challenged.  Good instruction and lots of routines make it easy to stick with this program as it has room for progression as you gain flexibility and get more comfortable with Pilates.  There's also a supplemental yoga section, which is also great.  I wasn't interested in yoga but after working with this section of the DVD and seeing the benefits, I'm now looking to add a yoga DVD into my collection.

Pilates is much more subtle then other exercise I've done. You really do need to focus and pay attention to alignment, your breathing and contract and stretch muscle groups as instructed.

If you do this program on a regular basis and really focus on each move it pays off.  My abs are starting to get flatter and this is the first exercise that I've found that is toning my thighs.

A trainer told me that I needed to work on ""core strength and flexibility"" and suggested Pilates.  I've been alternating routines Pilates with walking and what a fantastic combination.  The Pilates has helped me get a stronger back and abs, improved the movement in my hips and given me better overall alignment and posture.

We've tried some of the alternative workouts in hopes of finding something we liked, but even if we could find something that worked, we simply don't like it--the hostess is uninspiring and the workout sequences are uncreative.",1209859200,18,677,5.053571428571429

However, I think even this DVD aimed at people with flexibility issues, it's too advanced for me.  I like that it has a basic lesson at the beginning so you know how to align your body while you exercise, but I had trouble getting past 15 or so minutes of the basic routine...the thing is, I'm in the process of losing a lot of weight, and I'm still pretty overweight, by about 50 lbs, so maybe because of that, I have trouble getting into the right position and I end up straining more as a result.  I'm fairly fit when it comes to cardio, and I have recently started using therabands for strength training (I can't afford gym membership, and the resistance tubing is just as effective as weight traning), but I just can't seem to do this workout effectively yet.  I'm still pleased with the product, and I hope I'll be able to use it once I lose some more pounds and inches.  I've incorporated the basic lesson into my workout routine, actually, because it helps with some of my back issues to do those exercises...maybe doing them over time will get me more adept at doing pilates.  This is for inflexible people, but I guess for me it's just not modified enough.  So if you are overweight and not in the greatest of shape, I would say that you should try it after losing a bit more weight when you are in need of toning exercises.

It is intended for those new to Pilates and provides a variety of workout options, starting with more modified versions for the complete beginner and progressing to other beginning routines.  The workouts feature instructor Maggie Rhoades practicing alone (on a beautiful beach at Half Moon Bay Resort in Antigua) with voiceover instruction.  All of the workouts use a mat, and 1-lb. dumbbells are used in a few segments.

A overview of the DVD is provided below; I've first listed the main menu items and then have broken down the two submenus, ""Getting Started"" and ""As You Progress."" The times for each practice are given as they appear on-screen, but I've added adjusted times in parentheses based on my own review. I've also included brief summaries of the composition of each segment; these summaries are meant to provide an overview rather than to be all-inclusive.  Finally, some workouts consist of stand-alone segments, whereas others are compilations of several previous segments (which I've noted when applicable).

Overall, this is an very well-done DVD, but I had a few issues with it.  First of all, Maggie does not follow traditional Pilates sequencing in her approach; because I'm more experienced in Pilates, the flow sometimes felt strange to me.  Similarly, the way some of the segments were combined to form the various workouts also felt a little odd--for example, why put the ""Essentials"" segment at the end of the ""Abs & Arms"" workout above?  For those new to Pilates, however, these factors may not be an issue.  I do think that this DVD, with its huge variety of options, could be a bit overwhelming to someone who has never done Pilates before, but for those who have some prior familiarity with the discipline, need modified versions of the exercises, and prefer a wide selection of routines, Pilates for Beginners might be an ideal choice.",1171497600,119,6174,5.44794952681388

It really is for an unflexible body, unlike the Mari Winsor series (which is great if you've a healthy back) or others this one is great if you're a beginer or have had health issues, check with your doctor first, but I would gladly recomend this one to anyone of all ages.",1171152000,44,649,4.30327868852459

Maggie Rhoades is a great teacher.  Her DVD is truly one of the best I've ever found.  My core strength has improved 100% since I've started using this dvd.  I am more flexible and have found that in my ability - strength-wise and balance-wise has greatly improved now in other sports as well.

After you heat up with the 100's and rest of the warm-up you almost feel like you are on that beach next to the instructor doing the routines. Other videos are often filmed in a stark unchanging studio and can get boring after a few times.

The instructor has a nice smile and pleasing voice, and gives just the right amount of instruction and with the right tempo, making the exercises very easy to follow while always reminding you of your posture and breath. The routines  flow easily from pose to pose without unnecessary gaps or breaks. The first part is perfect for beginners, yet I found the second part challenging enough for an early intermediate level. Don't skip the intro, where the instructor does a nice job explaining what pilates is all about and how to intergrate it in your practice.

Since this video in enjoyable to do, I find myself practicing with  it often. I just returned from a snowboarding trip and felt improvements in my core strengh, balance and flexibility.

I tried a park district class for 6-7 weeks but had to quit because my back was getting worse and i thought that i just didn't have the strength to do pilates.  My friends kept insisting that pilates, when done correctly would really help me with my problems.  I looked in to private lessons and knew i wasn't able to make the financial or time commitment.  I decided to give it one more go with the aid of a dvd.  I lucked in to this dvd- picking it because it had Beginners in the title.  What i didn't expect was to get such detailed oral and visual instruction.  I understood more watching the dvd than i did in the classroom.  It is easy to follow and has helped to improve my core strength so i can use those muscles and depend on my back less.  Maggie Rhodes not only teaches pilates moves she teaches how to move while doing them.  This has been the most helpful aspect of the dvd, learning how to move correctly.

The DVD is interactive, which means you can choose what you want to do depending on how much time you have - 20 minutes, 30 minutes or an hour.  Maggie Rhodes has put together different sequences of exercises and modifies them enough that even us older folks can tackle most of them. In addition, you get Pilates and Yoga at the same time.

Most Yoga and Pilates tapes are geared towards the 20 somethings and most of the ones that I have purchased either end up at my daughter's house or in the trash.  This is not to say that they are bad but I am just not as limber as I used to be.  With Pilates Complete for Inflexible People at least I can do most of the routines without having to hobble around the next day.

I haven't even done the whole DVD but I have done enough to know that I am ordering another copy.

1806616,5,B00007D00N,This is a great workout.  At first I was disappointed because while I was doing the workout it seemed too easy.  I thought it couldn't possibly be doing anything because I wasn't even sweating.  However the next day my stomach and arm muscles were sore so I guess that means it must be doing something.  I recommend this workout for those who hate to work out like I do.,1155340800,74,370,4.318840579710145
1806627,5,B00007D00N,"This DVD provides a special ""Beginners View Mode"" that is really cool. They basically have 3 people doing the exercises and give you the option to select a focus on the person doing the ""light"" version of the exercises, so you can see how to get started.

From the goal of having a well-rounded exercise perspective, I think that focusing on what she is doing and then mixing with a good cardio or weight program would do your body the most good, preventing you from getting the ""over-strained"" or ""over-stretched"" muscle joint problems that can be common with any stretching centered routine.

Overall I give it 5 stars for really being balanced and having a ""true"" beginner mode.",1153267200,11,681,4.762711864406779
1806628,5,B00007D00N,Was very leary of ordering this because piates is totaly new to me. I did not think I would be able to do much if any of the exersizes. But thankfully I was wrong! This was great to get into pilates with! I am very happy with this DVD!,1153094400,36,235,3.816326530612245
1806629,5,B00007D00N,"I find the workout very goo for beginners, it doesn't  exhaust you and it relaxes, working the majority of muscles and taking care of your spine",1140566400,3,144,4.538461538461538
1806630,5,B00007D00N,"I had always wanted to try Pilates, but was intimidated by the thought of actually trying some of the exercises that I've seen people doing. I hurt my left knee 3 years ago and have a hard time walking and sitting for any length of time. Well, I had a hard time. I have been using this dvd for 2 months now, and can do all the beginner's exercises, even the ones I thought I couldn't do. I was pleasantly surprised at the enjoyment and sense of well-being that I get from the program. The instructor is laid back, pleasant, and offers helpful hints. You can actually see what she is doing at all times, and she explains things very well.",1138924800,177,637,4.2727272727272725
1806631,4,B00007D00N,"As a personal trainer I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who considers themselves inflexible, or recovery from injury.

1806632,5,B00007D00N,I've been to a few Pilates classes and loved the Pilates routine itself but always found it so hard to keep up with the instructor and felt as if I was missing something.  I give this DVD a big thumbs up for taking the time to guide you through each exercise and come with with many modifications for us real world folks.,1135900800,76,321,4.17741935483871
1806633,5,B00007D00N,I have suffered from arthritis in my hands and knees for sometime and could never really navigate some of these at home workout videos.  In just a  short time I've been able to do several of the exercises on the DVD without much pain and enjoy the routines as there are modifications to meet just about every level.  Recommended the DVD to a friend of mine and she love it as well.,1135728000,56,381,4.263888888888889
1806634,5,B00007D00N,"This DVD was more challenging than I thought, but within a few short weeks I can already see an improvement in my flexibility and overall fitness.  Recently someone who had not seen me in a while commented that my body looked different, so I guess that means the programs really work. HAHA :-) Overall I have been impressed with not only the level of difficulty but also the variety of content and workouts available.  I easily recommend this DVD.",1133222400,64,447,4.6455696202531644

Pilates is not traditionally a ""man"" thing for me and most guys I know, but this one really is challening and has helped me open my hamstrings, and I never knew Pilates worked the abs so damn much, or at least in this DVD.  Many great features most important the variety in workout times from 10 minutes to 60.  No complaints here.",1132531200,144,428,4.195121951219512
1806636,5,B00007D00N,"This DVD is practical, tough, and results oriented.  Within 15 minutes I was sweating all over the place, and had to stop momentarily to catch my breathe.  What I loved most of all was the baby-steps used by the instructor leading up to each exercise, especialy for someone with tight hamstrings as yours truly.",1132012800,30,311,4.7407407407407405

7975209,5,B00007D00N,"My husband and I are in our mid 50's.  We love this video.  It is easy, yet challenging and the workouts are taught in a way that make you feel  as though ""you can do it"".  The sessions are broken down into short lessons that give you time to learn the proper form before taking on the full workout.  Maggie emphasizes the importance of correct breathing and focus on the core.  My husband and I notice that our breathing is improving which diminishes injuries.  This is a terrific video for all ages.  We will be using this video for a long time because the presentation of the excercises are simple, yet challenging.
