4009082,4,B002XJDUX0,"Season 2 of Head Case has two DVD discs so I was expecting a few more episodes after the fourth show on disc 2. I thought the Freud Liberation Army would be much funnier, but I might know too much about Freud already. One of the best lines:

I don't like made up religions.

People have been trying to figure out how to worship for thousands of years, competing with various local customs. Head Case is not usually about religion. The significance of marriage and anxiety attacks dominate season 2. My real life has been devoid of comedy at this level, so I was vulnerable to becoming a fan that laughs at things other people hardly ever read about. My attempts to put a literary life together for myself are piffle compared to the final episode of Head Case. Random House is not as interested in an author as in a subject like how celebrity has become such a dominating entertainment value for people who wonder what is going on. I did not know the actors in most of the shows, but the shrink who falls asleep and the therapist passing out after drinking resonate with what my brain does so frequently that I must have struggled to stay awake to see this season.

My DVD of Head Case Season 1 has another fan in Saint Paul so I found out (from her) more about some of the people involved. I can understand why Andy Dick is almost a regular character playing himself. I like to make comparisons with rock and roll. I can't think of a single hit song about a psychotic shrink.",1354406400,,1475,4.375912408759124
4009083,3,B002XJDUX0,"Season one is the stronger of the two seasons on DVD. Maybe it's the guest stars, the fresh ideas, storylines, etc. I personally found myself wanting to see more of Dr. Myron Finkelstein (Fred Landedberg) I think he was really underused. Overall the show is entertaining but it's best to watch one episode at a time (small doses) and the improv is only as good as the subject and actors, it's no Curb. IMDB has it listed as three seasons but the DVD Complete set is two seasons. I think this show had some webisodes too bad they aren't included on the DVD. I would suggest viewing some clips on the web, Netflix it, or rent first. If you find yourself laughing at the dialogue it's probably worth adding to your collection. Get the full set though unless you already own season one.",1341273600,,782,4.475524475524476
8383697,5,B002XJDUX0,"Hilarious, edgy and absolutely unique.  Wentworth is priceless.",1525219200,,63,6.875
8383698,1,B002XJDUX0,"I discovered this cable t.v. show through a DVD streaming service from the public library. The first season was probably the best. I bought the second season expecting the same funny storylines, but this episodes were more raunchy than funny.",1461628800,,242,5.075
8383699,5,B002XJDUX0,Hilarious!  love this.  am so sad that it was cancelled.  every episode is funny.,1461456000,,81,4.642857142857143

8383701,5,B002XJDUX0,Ali Wentworth is a comedic goddess! This show made me laugh out loud more times than I can remember. Bottom line: Worth the watch.,1428624000,,130,4.458333333333333
8383702,5,B002XJDUX0,"One of the funniest series ever. A psychiatrist who tells everyone's
confidential secrets to everyone else.",1413763200,,107,5.75
8383703,5,B002XJDUX0,We stumbled upon this show and it's crazy funny!  I wish there were more episodes.  You need to know that everything is improvised on Head Case and there are some wacky performances by the guest stars but Dr. Goode is the absolute best.,1392940800,,236,4.465116279069767
8383704,5,B002XJDUX0,This is a very funny series. I can't believe they didn't continue it although it did seem that they had exhausted themes for continuing for a new season. It holds up for view our absurdities and overwhelming need for love and contact regardless of what's obviously not good for us. One of my favorites.,1386201600,,302,4.611111111111111
8383705,5,B002XJDUX0,"This is such a funny show. A little raunchy but great! I also like Party Down by Starz also! You need a laugh, look no further!!",1375920000,,128,3.9615384615384617
8383706,5,B002XJDUX0,I love her Alexandra Wentworth - could see more and more. Ali Wentworth should be seen more. Great comedic style. Hope to see her soon,1366761600,,134,4.4
