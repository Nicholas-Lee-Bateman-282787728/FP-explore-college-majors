I have all 16 series region 2 and now it is a new region release.  But, won't despair and not wait to buy, obviously.
Judge for yourself.  Will write an update when I actually see it.

6414183,3,B00KC77Z4A,I haven't seen season 17-season one was 4 1/2 to 5 stars-but I have no idea what happened in seasons 2-16 so am uneasy about purchasing this. This makes no sense whatsoever-why skip 15 seasons?? This is not exactly a good sales technique. Are previous seasons going to be released?? I just don't see why BBC thinks people are going to rush out and buy a show with15 seasons missing.,1413936000,22,382,4.4714285714285715

6414185,4,B00KC77Z4A,"much improved over the earlier seasons.  Good interplay between the personalities, more focus on the clinical methods etc.and a more realistic portrayal of what ME's actually do rather then the earlier focus on the ""lone wolf"" attitude in seasons 1,2 & 3.

6414205,4,B00KC77Z4A,"good show, not flashy like american crime/forensic shows",1444521600,,56,6.125
6414206,5,B00KC77Z4A,"This series did indeed get better as the years wore on and it started out very good. One must remember that the UK series are much shorter than ours. This, for example, has 5 episodes whereas American network series tv has 22-24 episodes per season. It is only recently with our cable and internet series shows where American shows are also going for shorter series tv. It is easier to keep the show fresh if you don't have to come up with 22-24 episodes in any given year. That is an awful lot of one character and few actors have that much personal magnetism to sustain the viewer.  So that is perhaps the number one reason why this show still seems fresh to us this many seasons later. With fewer episodes, it also was easier to switch cast members around as the years went onward.

Another reason this is better 17 seasons later is that the field itself is more interesting. It was a lot more limited 17 years ago what one could achieve in this area of medicine. It has now blown through the roof on what can be achieved.  So the stories being developed mirror the headlines in the CSI professional field. This is fascinating source material.

I am one of the few people here who have seen the entire show. You do not need to see one season to view another season. The actors personal lives are never explored that much. The cases dominate the action. That said, it was sad to lose some of the characters along the way and probably the years when Dr. Leo is in the lab are very best of this series.

I would not let seeing this out of sequence bother you. It would be nice but I don't think it is necessary to enjoying the stories. It is a very well done show and generally superior to our shows of the same type.",1441584000,2,1717,4.303405572755418
6414207,3,B00KC77Z4A,"Somewhat interesting and timely story-line, episode characters would have benefitted from additional development. Regular cast members do not inspire long-time interest.",1440979200,,169,7.095238095238095

6414210,5,B00KC77Z4A,I have seen all of the 17 seasons and this one is different because of changes in the characters.  It is splendid acting and intriquing.  I am waiting for 18 next week.,1438214400,,168,4.21875

6414219,3,B00KC77Z4A,the series seems okay.  I have not seen any of the earlier seasons so I don't know how this one compares.  I probably won''t buy the rest of the season as paying for two episodes for one show seems a bit pricey to me.  I like forensic shows and this one seems as good as most,1431734400,,275,3.875
6414220,5,B00KC77Z4A,Great British series. Emilia Fox is wonderful.  As good as the earlier Silent Witnesses with Amanda Burton.,1431216000,,107,5.294117647058823

The characters are nuanced and the plots are compelling,  making this a valuable series to add to your catalog.  I am sure I am not the only one who would buy more seasons if they were made available.",1425945600,6,362,4.128571428571429

6414228,5,B00KC77Z4A,"okay, maybe I'm bias but I LLLOOOVVVVVVEEEEEDDDDDD this series! The plot was engrossing, the story was just enough -not too overdone or overly dramatic, and the direction was great! I loved watching EVERY epi and spent a ton of money because each epi had another part and then I got so hooked into the characters on the show that I had to keep watching. Oddly enough my fav character was not the blonde Nikki but the Analyst dude that chased down all the bad guys, tried to tell Nikki to back off, and that worked very closely with Clarissa. Unfortunately and to my discredit I can't remember his name :( The series did not contain a lot of intimacy - thank the good Lord - and it didn't need it. The series is chock full of what its supposed to be about - solving crimes through forensic investigation - not all that overdone drama about the characters personal lives (CSI), who they're sleeping with (CSI - Miami, CSI, CSI - New York, etc., etc.). This series stayed on target and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Well done!",1421712000,6,1018,4.478494623655914
6414229,3,B00KC77Z4A,"Enjoyed the show. Reminds me of ""Waking the Dead"".",1421539200,,50,4.666666666666667

6414231,5,B00KC77Z4A,Still an amazing series that has not diminished after seventeen series . We'll worth watching for all people whether they are fans or not .,1420848000,2,139,4.6
6414232,4,B00KC77Z4A,"I have seen all 17 series of this show. It was at its best mid way through. This was when the cast was Leo as head, with Nikki and Harry as the pathologists under Leo. What happens is that we get down to just Nikki and new members of the cast. It is not that they are bad but it is not the same. The first season the show was not as good either since it had a different cast with a woman in the lead. If you have seen ALL of it as I have, those middle seasons with the threesome are absolutely golden. It is the very best of UK tv. However, each and every season is extremely well written and acted. If one were to compare it to CSI, it becomes rather laughable because this is so much better with just a fraction of the budget and none of the name stars. It is so much more realistic. If you think CSI is good, you will think this is out of this world. The format does not vary. Each story goes over two episodes involving a crime which involves pathologists working in their expert capacity. There is no loud rock music playing over their doing their autopsies either.",1420848000,13,1070,4.075829383886256
6414233,4,B00KC77Z4A,Don't care for it as much as the First Season. Actors were changed as well as story lines,1420416000,,89,4.0

6414236,3,B00KC77Z4A,"Disappointing:  Quality of stories is uneven.  The quality of the writing about the stories is uneven.  I keep wondering how the actors would do if they had really good material to work with.  Maybe it's time for everyone; producers, directors, writers etc., to move on to something else.",1418428800,,288,4.9375

6414239,5,B00KC77Z4A,"One of my favorite Brit mystery series. It's suffered a bit from the departure, first of Tom Ward (Dr. Harry Cunningham) and, afterwards, of William Gaminara (Professor Leo Dalton). I was very disappointed when Amanda Burton left the show, but the team that came in after her departure, including Emilia Fox (Dr. Nicki Alexander), were just as good. This new group is a bit of a disappointment. Still, I hang on in hopes.....",1416787200,3,425,4.835616438356165

8657487,2,B00KC77Z4A,"I found the stories engaging but the writing, in particular of the characters, is predictable, cliched and over$one. The acting, as well, especially the male lead, is stilted, over acted and annoying. I enjoyed the first seasons I saw but now into the 21st, its merely tedious. I must be desperate and may be to keep watching. How is it that so many Brit dramas are over writt3n and dramatized? They should watch more Scandinavian (Swedish and Danish. Oh and Icelandic) films to get some understanding of subtly.",1520640000,,512,4.829545454545454
