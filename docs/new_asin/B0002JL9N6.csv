2099710,5,B0002JL9N6,"Filmed with the same hushed awe that the books inspire, the movie shows an unexpectedly charismatic Goldsworthy. An inspiration to artists, architects, landscape architects and those who want to be, this film records Goldsworthy's philosophy of and inspiration for his art. It also shows the lifestyle and passion of an artist.",1100736000,3,327,5.431372549019608
2099711,5,B0002JL9N6,"For those who are not familiar with Andy Goldsworthy's work, he creates sculptures from nature, using rocks and tree branches and grass and anything else around the location he has chosen.  He has decided specifically to create scultpures that will only stand temporarily, as he searches for a better understanding of life, death, and the passage of time.  This film does a fantastic job of exploring the creative process and amazing things that can happen when an artist continues to experiment and look for new opportunities.  Through this discovery, Goldsworthy passes on to us his philosophy and unique perspective on the world.  It is truly a visually beautiful film and worth watching on that merit alone.  For those of us who are artists, it is a must-see, both to learn and identify with someone who has a beautiful understanding of the world.",1100131200,93,851,4.964788732394366
2099712,5,B0002JL9N6,"Rivers & Tides is such an excellent way to express the true spirit of giving - its not the ""stuff"" that's important, but the effort behind it. Give yourself and your family and friends a new way to look at nature and life.",1099180800,4,222,4.186046511627907

2099716,5,B0002JL9N6,"Not only is it beautiful and moving, it's wonderfully hypnotic.  Andy Goldsworthy and the Director Thomas Riedelsheimer take you on a incredibly memorable journey and help reconnect you to the beauty (and philosphy) of being at one with nature.

The DVD also contains over 40 minutes of equally stunning bonus materials that were not part of the original feature film and have never-been-seen-before.

This majestic film/DVD ranks as my #1 all-time favorite DVD.  Get it!  You will not be dissapointed.",1095638400,18,502,5.225
2099717,5,B0002JL9N6,"My wife and I were visiting San Francisco and happened upon an article about the movie, then playing in theatres.  The description of the film seemed interesting, but what really grabbed my attention was that legendary compososer, multi-instrumentalist, and improvisor Fred Frith had created the sound track.

We went the next day and were immediately drawn into the work and life of Goldsworthy.  Not having had any knowledge of him, it was a wonderous discovery to see him working in such an amazingly realized artistic language, speaking so clearly, powerfully, and beautifully about the fragility of nature through his art.

This movie is about Goldsworthy and his work, but it is also a work of art in itself.  I expect that I'll be giving this DVD to all my friends this holiday season.",1093824000,14,792,4.924812030075188
2099718,5,B0002JL9N6,"When Rivers and Tides was in a local theatre, I rushed to see it because I have long been a fan of Goldsworthy.  The experience was a totally new way of seeing his work.  The video images are even better than his photographs.  In some ways, the dynamic imagery even exceeds the experience of visiting one of his installations.  The interviews with him as he works are delightful gems of insight into his artistic approach.  If you like his books and installations, you will love this video.",1091145600,16,490,4.586206896551724

2099747,5,B0002JL9N6,"Goldsworthy is in my opinion the greatest artist of our time, going out into nature rain, shine, wind, sleet or snow to patiently create amazing sculptures out of leaves, rocks, twigs, icicles, and whatever catches his fancy. He captures these exhilaratingly beautiful and totally original creations on film, which is lucky for us, because most of his pieces are made to be destroyed by wind, rain, tides, and time. Their destruction is meant to be as much a part of the art as is their creation. A breathtaking book, which would be the one I would take to a desert island. Finally a coffee-table book that will be enjoyed over and over'",1411344000,,637,4.696428571428571

2099753,5,B0002JL9N6,"Very good to have this film as a supplement to Andy Goldsworthy's books of photographs.  It seems essential to a full appreciation of his art, as it showcases the process and temporality of each piece, along with a fuller experience of each work's physical environment.  And a beautifully made film.",1387756800,,299,4.96
2099754,5,B0002JL9N6,"If you don't know Andy Goldworthy's art, I think you're in for a treat. This is also QUITE child-friendly.

HIs basic brief is to go out into the world and make something from what he finds there. Then he photographs it, and then lets it return to what it was. Some of his installation pieces in galleries have been pine-cone shaped stacks of slate, or other naturally occurring building material. Tori Amos stood in one of the slate stacks, as if it were a skirt, for the cover of one of her early records. Once he made a collection of snow balls with various contents, stored them, and the put them out in the gallery to melt and reveal their content.

Its all about using what's actually there, but also all about time and how impermanent the world is. Nothing we see, not the rocks, not the mountains, not even the sea, will last for ever. Ok, ok, and the point is???? Ok. The first piece in this film is filmed before dawn, in Newfoundland. Goldworthy is out with a little bowl of water, and he's collected a bunch of carrot-sized icicles, and he's breaking them into segments and using the water to stick them back together to make an arc that starts and ends on the side of a big rock down by the ocean- like a letter C stuck to the rock as if: / C| / then the camera pulls back and you can see he's made a series of these, like the old arrow-though the head gag, a series of loops on both sides of the rock

.........I
.........L/ \
........./.....D
......C/......\
......./........D
....C/..........\

so it looks like the icicle is threaded back and forth through the rock and the at the top it turns and goes up a couple of feet straight up. Nice. He's got gloves but he's working with bare fingers because he gets better control of the ice pieces that way. It looks COLD. Just as he's about to take the picture, the sun comes up, its been twilight as he's been working, and the sunlight falls on the icicle pieces and they turn on with the golden light as if they're neon tubes or something like that... completely unexpected.

I find this charming, and it may not be the best piece in the film. Maybe the failures, the stack of rocks that keeps collapsing, the screen of sticks pinned together with thorns that a tiny breeze destroys, are the best. Good lesson for kids- some ideas don't work out- give it your best, and if it isn't going to happen, do something else. Its like going back 50,000 years to when art and engineering and science were more or less the same thing... What happens to the gallery wall he covers with mud is so cool I'm not going to reveal it. Suffice to say, its really, really, cool. Goldsworthy is playful, but also thoughful and direct.

In Berkeley, California, this was the Star Wars of documentaries- it ran for 6 months in a theater on Shattuck. That's whare I first saw it.",1383868800,,2820,4.39272030651341
2099755,5,B0002JL9N6,"Andy Goldsworthy's photography books are wonderful, but I don't think they can compare to seeing the actual movement in his pieces. Also, hearing him speak about his thoughts and watching him work is so powerful.  I showed this to several seniors in my family, and they were just as captivated as I was. One of the seniors is hard of hearing, so the breathtaking visuals fill in when the sound doesn't get through to her. The other senior has mentation issues and tends to talk a lot while a  DVD is being shown. That constant interruption can be very annoying. The room was quiet for this DVD.  Everyone was entranced, present, and fully engaged. The result was a lasting sense of inspiration and peace for all.  Thank you, Mr. Goldsworthy, and filmmakers et al...",1379289600,,765,4.686567164179104

2099758,5,B0002JL9N6,"One of my favorite artists, this compelling video gives you a glimpse into his creations, inspirations, and leaves you wanting to get into nature yourself.  Love turning it on early in the morning - my children are memorized by the imagines and has them asking questions about nature, art, ""when can we do that"" :).

2099760,5,B0002JL9N6,"Andy Galsworthy is a unique artist because of the way he communicates with different aspects of nature. His work does not simply depict nature: he uses material he finds in it to enhance aspects which he discovers and to create extraordinary beauty which without him would remain hidden. The documentary is exceptionally well made in that it not only shows us Galsworthy's work in all its glory and originality, but it also allows us to get to know the artist, his techniques and - most importantly - makes clear what motivates him. The camerawork is fabulous and makes the movie even more fascinating.",1360713600,,602,4.854368932038835

2099762,5,B0002JL9N6,"Andy Goldsworthy is truly a gifted and talented artist and sculpturist. This documentary is something you watch when you have time to snuggle-up on a couch and spend the time to SAVOR it. It's guaranteed to get your mind out of your tiny, little life and enjoy several different perceptions of NATURE-MEETS-ART that are most likely totally alien to you.",1360368000,,353,4.9
2099763,4,B0002JL9N6,"This is a visually stunning video, but the art is very confusing at first. Impermanent creations made in nature out of ice, driftwood and sheep's wool are time-consuming to create and sometimes seem pointless, but the end results are breathtaking. Perfectly-shaped eggs made of piled stones seem to be the sturdiest of his creations, but the entire processes he goes through to create these images are amazing to watch. How does he think of these things? Incredible!
Andy Goldsworthy's discussion of his art is a special glimpse into the mind of an artist, and the video is well-worth watching. Just don't be in a hurry!",1357084800,,620,4.914285714285715
2099764,5,B0002JL9N6,"This is my first experience with Goldsworthy's art and I loved it. However, he means for his art to be temporary and to watch something that took hours, even days, to make and is lovely, be slowly destroyed is sad. One piece didn't even wait and destroyed itself in the wind.  One has to have a lot of courage to make this kind of art.",1356998400,,335,4.153846153846154
2099765,5,B0002JL9N6,"The film is a work of art about a great artist.

2099766,2,B0002JL9N6,"From reviews online and quoted reviews from reputable newspapers I really expected good things from this. However, the film quality was very poor - just about the opposite of ""high definition"". The narration was patchy and conveyed little.

Best thsat could be said of this was that it is ""whimsical"" - that is the most polite way of putting it that I can think of.

2099767,5,B0002JL9N6,"Love this film. Rarely do I purchase movies, but this is a must have. Through Andy's vision and creativity, we are reminded that reconnecting with nature is primal food for the soul. Joy in the process, the exchange, the present moment, is what matters. Essential viewing for the artist, the lover of nature, and anyone wishing to be wowed.",1338076800,,340,4.779661016949152
2099768,5,B0002JL9N6,"A wonderful documentary, insightful and truly beautiful and unique. Andy Goldworthy's work is inspirational and magnificent.

2099769,5,B0002JL9N6,"Andy Goldsworthy's art is created from nature and then destroyed by nature, sometimes on the same day or in a few hours.  Using rocks, leaves, thorns, sticks, things found on-site, he makes shapes which have meaning for him.  As the film progressed, I was shocked to see him, absorbed, childlike, working against the clock, using his bare hands to dig and tear and lug and arrange the materials for his sculptures, at the expense of his own fingers.  He had cuts and Band-aids all over his irreplaceable hands.  I've known a number of installation artists, (including my own husband, Shingo Honda, an early creator in the Mono Ha movement in 1970s Japan) and have observed that most installations are impermanent.  After they've been seen in museums, they go away to spaces unknown.  I think it must be satisfying for Andy Goldsworthy to be able to be there and watch while what he has so stunningly built from nature, goes stunningly back to nature, smashed by ocean waves or tossed about by a river.  At least he knows it's not languishing in some storage locker.  I gave Rivers And Tides five stars because it's inspiring to see this man who, in a low-key way, passionately follows his dreams.  It was a nice co-incidence that we watched it, in our Hawaiian rainforest home, on the December 2011 night of the eclipse of the full moon.  Even the moon can disappear!

2099770,5,B0002JL9N6,"The images are astounding and watching the Andy Goldsworthy create is a little bit like reading Genesis (but Goldsworthy has the wisdom to mimic something about nature that is utterly perfect instead of creating creatures ""in his image!""). After watching it I went for a long hike alone and looked at shapes made by water, wind and rock. Godlsworthy seems born with an eye for the miraculous and I felt perhaps this is something that can be learned. Something about watching his creative process unfold leaves one breathless, but also more alive than before, and eager to see and do what one can to be connected with the Earth as much as Goldsworthy is. This is inspiring work and the film makers captured images as well as a glimpse of this great artists soul with a subtle passion that is perfect for the subject matter. I'll watch this one repeatedly.",1318896000,,854,4.7

2099782,5,B0002JL9N6,"In this documentation of his work, Goldsworthy reveals how humans can work with nature to transform the ordinary into extraordinary beauty. I was awed at both the imagery and the ideas behind his work. He creates much of his pieces from materials that will decompose or be swept away by water.

2099790,5,B0002JL9N6,"This DVD contains some of the most beautiful and fascinating nature art you will ever see.  What makes Andy Goldsworthy special is his creative process.  It's difficult to imagine how he conceives of his vast ideas, alone...but he also shows us the talent he has to see the concepts through, with great skill, labor and an eye for each and every detail.  These intricate, fragile works often require a great deal of patience, time and effort, on his part.  We are able to see the beauty in the sometimes temporal nature of the constructions, and it is conveyed that somehow being in the moment and being able to appreciate the process of how the art changes, over time, allows us to see that even when things destruct (or are made to eventually go back to their original form), that that, too, is ""art"".  Andy Goldsworthy is a master, at this.  There is an especially poignant moment in the film where a work Mr. Goldsworthy is trying to create keeps collapsing on him (three or four times, over the course of a few days).  The work itself--requiring an understanding of balance, physics and weight--shows us through the artist that the process itself, is ""art""....that even in the collapse, he ""gets to know the stone a little better, each time"".  The art, in many ways, becomes a analogy for what happens to people, in life.  It's just a really great film.  I've watched it over ten times (at least) and have not tired of it, yet.  Anyone with depth and an appreciation for beauty/nature should put this item into their shopping cart to be purchased as soon as possible!",1231372800,3,1572,4.6389891696750905
2099791,5,B0002JL9N6,"Goldsworthy captures the true not-knowing in which the process of creation is a true collaboration between the landscape, artist's senses, and his sensitivity (or, for the lack of a better word, his soul). The ecstasy of the sunrise lighting up stone icicles is matched by the bittersweet destruction of compositions by rivers, wind, gravity and time. rhythm permeates everything Andy does - the rhythm of change, the eternal clockwork of the tides, 'fire' created by the root's contact with the earth and seen in the blackened stem of the Scottish fern... Rhythm, and its intimate and integral partner, the chaotic decomposition into primordial elements. Destruction is an integral part of a Goldsworthy composition.

In this era when the relationship between the teacher & student, master & disciple, celebrity & awestruck peons is formalized and tends to be permeated by the deeply human notion of status and gain, Goldsworthy embodies its equally human antipode by living his life at the interface between solid & liquid, deeply profound & whimsical, village & countryside, life and death. The lack of pretentiousness in this film is, to a jaded cayote, breathtaking, humbling and ever so inspiring. i could watch and watch his band-aided fingers stick an icicle on another, a stone on a rock, a stick onto its counterpart.

just as Andy mediates his narrative by working with the elements, the filmmaker and composer contribute a sublime counterpoint with a sensitivity that is in every sense an equivalent to that of the primary creator. The filming has its own cadence and the music follows it, sometimes engulfing it, other times retreating. Just like a river. Or perhaps a tide. What we get, then, is an amplified artwork where everybody involved has practiced a letting go, a respect for the flow of color, of energy, of time and space.

The world deserves better than this. They don't even bother to show the full screen during the credits at the end, so some of them are undecipherable. It looks like the 2-disc set is also P&S.

It has also become something of a barometer of my own ability to SEE, to be in the moment. My tiny TV is in front of windows that look into the forest. I often have layers of nature in front of me, real and virtual. I hope to see another DVD like this in the future. I will be first in line.",1215388800,,573,4.079646017699115
2099801,5,B0002JL9N6,"Andy Goldsworthy creates art that a 5-year old can understand, stacking rocks, arranging leaves, piling sticks, drawing in the snow.  His ""work"" (as he keeps calling it) is simple in concept, but maybe not so simple to execute as well as he does.

And that is both the strength of it, and its downfall.  The simplicity is unpretentious and pure in a way that art very rarely is, these days.  At the same time it is fun and silly and unsophisticated in a way that makes Andy's serious pronouncements about ""his work"" and ""my art"" sound like a 5-year old kid who never got his parents' approval.  The fact that he spends so much energy building contructs of such fragile beauty, which are almost always blown away by the wind or tides until nothing remains -- and the fact that he gets so agitated when the inevitable collapse occurs -- make you wonder after his sanity.  Why does he torture himself so, what drives him to such Sisyphean frustration?

The film, by Thomas Reidelsheimer, deserves five stars for the languid portrait it paints of the hunger artist.  Like his following film Touch The Sound, it is a masterful exploration of a driven personality, one which manages to both illuminate -- and puzzle over -- the subject artist.  Both films also benefit from stunning soundtracks by Fred Frith.",1214784000,2,1303,4.704845814977974

He builds sculptures out of natural materials (stones, leaves, ice) and then waits for nature to do her part in the natural destruction of them.  His books have pictures of both the finished product and sometimes the sequence either leading up to or after the sculpture is complete, but to see the painstaking process of building (not always successfully) is very impressive.

And the piles of lavishing praise shown in these reviews take me to an extremely cynical place with the epiphany that Art is truly a minor part of peoples' lives. Even professional film critics (paired with the ""user comments"" of gullible civilians like/unlike yours truly) reserve a small window for the seeming ""fine"" arts, and whatever cow patty splats at their feet conveniently gets awarded the quota.

To be ironic and yet truthful, I highly recommend this film for some of the funniest moments in cinematic history. You will be cheering for Andy's little nature puzzles to collapse by the first quarter-hour, and when they do, it's devilish fun.",1206662400,9,763,4.9609375

2099808,4,B0002JL9N6,"Rivers and Tides: Andy Goldsworthy Working with Time (Thomas Riedelsheimer, 2001)

Andy Goldsworthy takes the concept of the mandala to its absurd extreme; he makes huge sculptures of natural materials whose entire purpose is to be destroyed by the elements. Upon hearing this, you kind of have to ask yourself what kind of mutter would do such a thing. Thomas Riedelsheimer aims to show you.

Rivers and Tides has the rather interesting distinction of having won every award for which it was nominated (there were seven, if you're keeping count), and it's pretty easy to see why. Not only is Goldsworthy himself quite charismatic (and, yes, more than a bit eccentric, which can only help in a documentary), but Riedelsheimer is a fantastic camerman. There's never a situation where you feel Riedelsheimer is overtly tugging at you-- this may have something to do with the organic nature of the things he's filming-- but despite the (rather odd, for a documentary) feeling of straightforward camerawork, it's impossible to dismiss the beautifully composed nature of some of the images. Granted, this is a film about composition, and much of it can be attributed to Goldsworthy; Riedelsheimer is, after all, filming Goldsworthy much of the time during the process of creation. But, for example, Riedelsheimer's lingering shot of the ice snake sculpture towards the beginning of the film; it's obvious no one set up the sun. It's as if Riedelsheimer took a few steps back, two or three to the left, saw what was going on, and then snapped camera to shoulder and started filming.

A gorgeous piece of work, which deserves a whole lot more exposure than it's gotten. See it soon. ****",1205107200,,1680,4.97153024911032

In all honesty, the big screen is the best way to fully experience the magic of Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy's remarkable natural works of living and moving art.  Since Goldsworthy's sculptures are made from transitory material he finds in nature (discs of melting ice that he so elegantly places near and around rootbound trees, cones made out of bits of pebble, just to name a few examples), none of his pieces last forever.  But, really, what does in this world?  Human beings spend so much time feeling to be master in command over nature, one another, material and living objects, and RIVERS & TIDES truly brings the message of the temporary state of nature and humankind in the world.  It ebbs and flows, and Goldsworthy's unassuming but dutiful continuity as a true natural artist, working with the medium of mother nature, to design intricate visual sculpture and installations out of the elements we take for granted all too often.

With that he tosses a mud ball made of dark red crushed iron stone into a river for an explosion of color. What once was solid is now liquid, the immobile stone now part of the flowing river. Ice. Twigs. Thorns. Dandelions. Rocks. Sand. Sheep wool. Snaking ribbons of braided leaves. From the North Pole to Canada, Japan, Australia, and New York, all of his work, most of which is ephemeral because that same nature will destroy it, is made from the elements of nature, sculpted in nature, and is about nature. But words cannot begin to unpack the haunting beauty and evocative power of his creations. This is a remarkable documentary about an extraordinary artist doing brilliant work. Goldsworthy narrates the film and explains how and why he does what he does. Themes of Creation and Creator loom large here.

Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works don't really last, except as photos or films of what they were. Now, one can argue that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in Scotland.",1166054400,2,863,4.917808219178082

Andy's artistic vision evokes every human emotion to those who can see. The experience of his art is transcendental. It takes patience to watch his suffering but in the end one is rewarded with an abundance of the vital nectar with which only the gifted can nourish the rest of us.

2099848,1,B0002JL9N6,"I am familiar with Goldsworthy's work. I have just returned from a 1,000-mile motorcycle trip, alone, to see the Goldsworthy exhibit at Meijer Gardens in Grand Rapids, Michigan. There are pieces by Andy Goldsworthy there that will make you weep for beauty.

This film communicates none of the beauty of Goldsworthy's work. Rather, it communicates just enough of it to tantalize... and leaves out enough to irritate.

The film maker is so caught up in ""creating"" something himself, he forgets that he is making a documentary. We get to see footage of Goldsworthy working -- but we never get to see what he is working on. The film is presented as if shot in letterbox format and cropped to 4:3 aspect ratio. The parts that would seem to give meaning to what you are seeing always seem to be just out of frame.

Tightly cropped shots of Goldsworthy's pieces fail to convey the context within which they have meaning. Flat, oblique shots of the pieces fail to communicate their shape. We are given images of Andy Goldsworthy looking at a piece he is working on, and talking about it, but we never get to see the piece itself. We are given shots of Goldsworthy carefully placing rocks, but we never get to see the pattern or shape he is creating with them.

There is a scene showing Goldsworthy talking about an ice sculpture he has just assembled; we get to see the pebble-covered beach where this takes place; Goldsworthy, himself, is just out of frame to the right; the piece in question is just out of frame to the left. We see just enough of it to know that the rising sun is illuminating the ice, and we get to hear Andy talking about how he hadn't known that the sun would illuminate both side of the piece -- but we don't get to see both sides of the piece. The result is frustrating and, in the end, pointless.

This documentary is NOT ""masterfully edited""; it is butchered. In the end, all it presents is the ego of the film maker. In addition, the music is often strident and distracting, and seems to have little to do with what is going on.

To its credit: There are a few scenes where the point of Goldworthy's work and its innate beauty cannot quite be obscured by this film's search for technique. There are scenes showing Goldsworthy assembling pieces, in which we get to see how difficult his task is. Unfortunately, the lesson is wasted, because we don't get to see the piece, itself, or we only get to see it without size references or locale; we don't get to see why Goldsworthy took on the difficult task in the first place.

If you have ever seen well-documented instances of Goldsworthy's ephemera, you will be disappointed by this film. If you don't already know about Goldsworthy's work, you will not gain an understanding of it or an appreciation of it from this film; the work is not present in this film.

What you might gain is a chance to hear Goldsworthy talking candidly about his work; and you will gain an appreciation of the hardships he endures to create these beautiful, ephemeral pieces.

But the thing that you will be most interested in will always be just outside the frame of this self-consciously pretentious piece of documentation that fails, utterly, to document.",1147996800,37,3204,4.607017543859649

2099851,5,B0002JL9N6,"As the jacket proclaims, this film is ""Gorgeously shot and masterfully edited,"" and, yes, it is mesmerizingly beautiful.  The timelessness that we perceive in stoic rock and in the unceasing ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works from Goldsworthy's hands so that in their very ephemeralness they point to eternity.

And so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in--or in the words of Matthew Arnold from ""Dover Beach"":

Listen! you hear the grating roar

Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,

At their return, up the high strand,

Begin, and cease, and then again begin,

With tremulous cadence slow, and bring

The eternal note of sadness in.

At one point near the end of the film Goldsworthy says that ""Words do their job, but what I'm doing here says a lot more.""  As a wordsmith myself I take no offense and not for a moment do I think him immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that Goldsworthy painstakingly and intuitively creates, is indeed something more than mere words can say.

At another point he remarks on ""What is here to stay...and what isn't.""  That is his theme.

I think that artists sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time; and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral.  The idea was, that by emphasizing how short-lived are even the mightiest works of humans, a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed.

Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy's work is in this sort of expression.  He painstakingly composes some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it, or places it in the river where it will be swept away; and in this process is merged both the composition and its ephemerality.

Both the transitory and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it.  And it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed is set within what is natural.  Thus the walls of stone and the eggs of stone that Goldsworthy constructs are silent and solid yet we know that they are not monuments to eternity, but instead will stay for some undefined length of time and then dissipate and return to a state much like that which existed before we came along.

This is art as art should be, akin to the spiritual.

In a sense Goldsworthy's work is an inarticulated understanding.  It is an experience purely of time and form.  In a sense his work ""answers"" Shelley's famous poem ""Ozymandias"" by saying, even as the tide washes the work away, and even as the river dissipates the expression, even so the art lives on because of our experience of it.  Similarly one thinks of Tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured out, and then just as they are so beautifully and preciously finished, they are given to the wind, so that we might know that all is flux.

Yet, in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos.  Goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer (of necessity I would say) and all his works, even the unsuccessful ones, he tells us, are photographed so that he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has not.

This cinematic production directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by Fred Frith is not to be missed.  It is one of the most beautiful documentaries that I have ever seen and one of the most spiritual.",1141862400,3,3657,4.671875

I AM SO THANKFUL TO HAVE FOUND THIS FILM.

Film is an excellent opportunity to show his unique art as it interacts with the nature that inspired it, changing over time. The moments focusing on the art itself were my favorite parts of the documentary, but they were few and far between. The majority of the time is spent in conversation with the artist as he tries to describe his work. Goldworthy himself says, ""There's a world beyond what words can define for me. Words do their job, but what I'm doing here says a lot more."" I agree with him completely, which is why I believe this film failed. It would have been much better if it was 1/3 the length and simply filmed the creation of the sculptures, their natural settings, and a glimpse of their lifespans, thereby letting the artwork speak for itself. If you're looking for a film about an artist struggling to explain his work, then definitely buy this. If you're interested in a film that focuses on the art itself, you'll likely find this film to be frustrating and unsatisfying.",1137888000,14,1145,4.617647058823529
2099854,5,B0002JL9N6,"Both Goldsworthy and his film maker ""meshed"" in making this superb documentary that is among the finest films on the life and work of an artist. It stands as ""sui generis,"" unlike any other biography or cinematic treatment in the genre, ""the life and art of.......""

Viewers will be taken with the patient, methodical cinematography that lets Goldsworthy, his work and the environments in which he is involved unfold organically. Director Reidelsheimer lets his camera linger lovingly throughout the 90 minute feature, resulting in our  immersion in the man, his art and surroundings. We are a bit shocked when we see the credits role.

The color range is often muted and elegant - even precise, contributing to the poetry inherent in Goldsworthy's work.

Finally, it is Goldsworthy himself that we embrace. What a joy to ""befriend"" an artist who is completely free of the elitist and egotistical baggage that too many contemporary artists carry, not  to mention the refreshing absence of art world jargon. He is warm, self-critical, humble, and a learner - transparently open to experiencing the natural world on its terms. And it shows in his beautiful, sometimes transitory, work.

Many have wondered if sculpture had become irrelevant, bypassed by installation projects. Goldsworthy, in his fusion of natural processes, the forms they suggest to him, and his sense of where they belong, has given us the gift of a memorable encounter in time and place. He truly has taken the sculpture to another level. Ultimately, his cairns,  icicle assembies, flower-petal pools and ruddy water falls abide in our consciousness, provoking the same imperative that Rilke realized when he contemplated a marble male torso that had survived from the Hellenistic era: You (we) must change your (our) life!

What Andy does with Nature is mind-bending in itself.  This film lets the viewer into the artist's eye, where this soft-spoken man ""sees"" the potential for these works of art; a stunning revelation.  He constructs these delicately quiet, yet marvelous, works in remote and untrammeled areas and locations - and so few people will ever see these works of art in their original form or place.  He works so hard and so diligently on beauty that, more often than not, will not last - sometimes (in the case of the ice work) only until the temperature goes up and the sculpture simply sublimates away.  And that , for me, was the main point of the film.  The director has captured these wonderful artworks for all time, though some did not last 24 hours, and the artist's work is all the more poignant and brilliant for its brevity.

2099857,5,B0002JL9N6,"I first discovered Andy Goldsworthy almost 10 years ago when, in high school, I visited the Getty Museum in Los Angeles with my friend Alex. Alex's aunt was a curator at the museum, so we were afforded a behind-the-scenes tour. Deep within the recesses of the research library I discovered one of Goldsworthy's clay dome pieces, slowly drying and cracking under a shaft of natural light from the roof above.

Fast-forward to this week and the latest installment in the City Arts and Lectures series here in San Francisco. Andy Goldsworthy was giving a slide lecture on his work and I just had to be there because between this week and that first moment of discovery, I had watched a wonderful documentary on Goldsworthy called ""Rivers and Tides"". Before watching the documentary, I had never realized that the clay dome at the Getty was created by Goldsworthy, but after watching this beautiful, lyric work from Thomas Riedelsheimer, I could understand why that sculpture enchanted me in the manner that it did.

Riedelsheimer formulates his vision by framing simple, locked-down shots, using time-lapse and an orchestration of organic sounds. But what he does best is to allow the power of Goldsworthy's transformations of nature to take center stage.

Goldsworthy is the kind of artist that makes you feel small about whatever silly profession it is to which you've decided to devote your life. His work (if that word does justice to his transformations) is both gasp-inspiring and playful. On one occasion, he covers an entire gallery wall with local clay and allows it to slowly crack in the dry air. In another place, Goldsworthy builds huge rock Cairns by stacking stones together vertically like a massive 3-D puzzle. His latest work, at the De Young Museum, is a very tongue-in-cheek piece- a simple crack in the granite that snakes its way from the roadway through the courtyard of the museum. When the De Young opens this week to great fanfare, a lot of people might not even notice the subtle work running through the courtyard- but I assure you the ones who do experience it, along with this documentary, will be rewarded for it.",1129075200,2,2141,4.892561983471074

2099859,5,B0002JL9N6,"Andy Goldwsorthy has a unique and fascinating way of relating to the natural world.  By living and feeling his surroundings intimately, he discovers things about naturally occurring materials that are invisible to the majority, and exploits these qualities to make beautiful environmental sculptures using techniques and designs susceptible to an infinite range of variations.  Although he seems inclined to be a recluse, he is also very articulate about his art, and his narration adds much to the film.  There is some clever editing, such as showing images of a ram with its large curling horns, which are phenomenally well mimicked by Goldsworthy's curved assemblages of chestnut leaves, held together only with thorns.  In fact, I thought I was looking at a ram's horn until I watched him assemble a chestnut sculpture in one of the short extra features (which are well worth watching).  The cinematography and soundtrack are also lovely, fully worthy of Goldsworthy's magnificent and visionary meditation on nature.",1118793600,,1020,5.35

2099863,5,B0002JL9N6,"This serene portrait, of the art and philosophy of sculptor Andy Goldsworthy, invites viewers to consider their current relationship to the evolving natural world around us.  Mr. Goldsworthy has a deep need for communing with the natural landscape and seeks to rearrange rocks, ice, wood, snow, leaves, vines, flowers, moss, straw and clay in order to ""touch the heart of the place"".  Indeed, the birth of a particular sculpture is often part of an active natural process that is taking place at each location: ""The very thing that brings the work to life, is the thing that will have a hand in its death or dissolution"".

Andy Goldsworthy's works generally have the quality of being ephemeral and are primarily created within remote natural settings.  Therefore the artist's own efforts to document the short life of each work, through photography, have historically been the way that these works come to be seen by the public in a gallery or museum setting.  With ""Rivers and Tides"", director Thomas Riedelsheimer assumes this task of visual documentation.  The subtitle of the documentary, ""Working With Time"", explores how the effects of the rising and falling of the ocean's tides, the flow of water in rivers and streams, plant growth through the seasons and even the movement of farm animals, all influence and interact with the artist's work.  The documentary medium of video now makes this fascinating study of time possible.

A wide range of Andy Goldsworthy's completed works are filmed, many being created specifically for this program.  The work was made throughout a number of different cycles of the seasons and in at least four major locations: Nova Scotia, Canada; Penpont, Scotland; Storm King, New York and Digne, France.  The ninety-minute documentary presents Mr. Goldsworthy as the sole narrator of his creative process.  The artist is shown scouting locations, gathering materials and using mostly his own hands to create works featuring incredible juxtapositions of physical form and color.

Composer and musician Fred Frith provides subtle sonic accents to this visual focus at interesting occasions within an otherwise partly silent journey.  Frith's haunting score is thoroughly integrated with the visual beauty and almost fanatical range of perspective in Mr. Riedelsheimer's documentary cinematography.

""Andy Goldsworthy: Rivers and Tides"" can be recommended, with confidence, to those with an interest in a holistic approach to contemporary art.",1105833600,79,2477,5.350515463917525
2099864,5,B0002JL9N6,"Andy Goldsworthy is well-known in certain art circles.  Hopefully, he'll become better known because of this film.  The biggest issue is the transient nature of his art, which is all based on transforming -- and often enhancing -- nature.  His art intentionally has a temporary life, and this film captures its ephemeral and stunningly beautiful nature.  Because of the work's nature, it can't be displayed in museums, and so this movie will have to suffice.

If you've had a bad day at the office, and have been told that you need to learn to meditate to unstress, this movie is for you.  It draws you in to the relaxed pace of Goldsworthy's work, and after only a few minutes, you'll completely be able to forget everything else going on in your life and focus on the beauty of Goldsworthy's work.

Even if you're not an art lover, it's impossible not to be drawn into the beauty of this work.  The photography is stunningly beautiful, and this film is structured in such a way that you enter the artist's mind and understand how he is able to create such beauty.",1104710400,17,1065,4.597883597883598
2099865,5,B0002JL9N6,"If you get a chance to see this film on a big screen, do it.  But home viewing is great too.  I also enjoy Goldsworthy's books... but it's particularly fun to watch the film and get a fuller sense of the process of construction (and sometimes destruction) of each work of nature-art.

Tip: play the DVD during a party with the TV on mute, and accompany with good music.",1104537600,11,369,4.318840579710145
2099866,2,B0002JL9N6,"I saw this at the local art house and it was a fantastic experience. If you can see this in a theatre, do so. I'm sorry to report that the DVD is garbage. First of all, it's letterboxed, which isn't indicated on the Amazon page or the DVD packaging. But far worse than that is the quality of the transfer. It looks as if it had been dubbed off of VHS tape--low resolution, blurry, and exhibiting a ton of compression artifacts. I can't believe no other reviewers have commented on this. Save your money or buy one of the many books of his amazing work instead.",1103932800,35,560,4.2924528301886795
2099867,4,B0002JL9N6,"This film is a slow-paced exploration of Scottish artist Andy Goldworthy's works, which are composed, displayed and deteriorate out-of-doors, generally. Goldsworthy works with sticks, roots, stones, ice etc. and forms beautiful winding images that float away or blow in the wind or are submerged with the tide. His interests are in the dynamics of nature and the temporary nature of art.

The works are beautiful to see and it is interesting to watch them disappear. There are plenty of comments by the artist, too, so if you are interested in the work or the man, you should feel satisfied by the end.

DVD extras are seven short films, which are terrific, and range from 2 to 20 minutes; stills and bios of the artist and the director.",1103241600,5,737,4.7952755905511815
2099868,5,B0002JL9N6,"I became enamoured of Andy Goldsworthy the first time I saw his book ""Collaborations with Nature"" -- here is an artist who works with nature, seeing possibilities in colors and compositions that, instead of reinventing what nature created, instead simply rearranges it in a way that deepens and enhances our understanding of the world, and of ourselves.

I had heard about ""Rivers and Tides"" and waited a long time to see it at a local art theater... and found that the man himself is as calm, as philosophical, and as elegant as the work he creates. In a peaceful and graceful documentary, allowing us the time we need to really absorb the beauty of his creations, Thomas Riedelsheimer has filmed his process and his thoughts as respectfully as the completed work. The soundtrack is exquisite and perfect as well.

Since buying the DVD just a week ago, I have watched it four times. Seeing him at the edge of the low tide in a cold grey sea patiently stacking rock upon rock, speaking in his quiet voice about the process of connecting with the stone, and then watching as the finished piece stands strong and solid against the incoming tide that devours it inch by inch -- wondering what the sea will do with this gift -- and then at the first blush of dawn, watching the tide ease out again, revealing the monolith, intact and serene -- this is magic at its purest.

Andy Goldsworthy is not like any other artist I have encountered. He is a simple man, living in a village in Scotland, who sees the connection between trees and earth, between sheep and the fields they graze, and between water in all its forms and the surfaces it moves across. He shows us how to see new possibilities, and how to have the patience to work with what we find. He shares his process with us in an intimate way, and I feel blessed to have this glimpse into this place where man dances with nature. It is simple, it is complex, it is profound, and it moves me and inspires me each time I watch it.",1101945600,44,1980,4.479224376731302
