5861150,2,B00DW7Y88I,"The Jungle is yet another addition to the over-saturated genre of found-footage film. Directed by Andrew Traucki, known for such men-eating animal thrillers as Black Water (co-directed with David Nerlich) and The Reef, the Australian film chronicles the expedition of a group of four people, led by a thirty-something big cat conservationist Larry (Rupert Reid), looking for endangered leopards in the Indonesian jungle.

As you expect, things go terribly wrong when they learn too late that there is something much more dangerous out there, poised to attack the expedition team.

The Jungle attempts to be a Predator and Blair Witch Project at the same time, and becomes none of them. The film is neither thrilling nor scary; it is just boring. You may forgive the shaky camera work, but not the dullness of the movie, in which not much happens during the course of less than 90 minutes. Also, because of the busy camera movement, we often just know what is going on.

Another minus is the character Larry which is (intentionally, I think) made unlikable. His attitudes to his wife and two Indonesian members are at best insensitive and at worst arrogant. Why should we care if something happens to the man?

My advice is simple: avoid it. The director did a much better work in the past. Watch Black Water, which is not perfect, but is still much entertaining.",1383264000,,1362,4.883116883116883

5861153,2,B00DW7Y88I,"Booooring. Just another boring, cliched, micro budget, c-movie ""horror"" title to throw on the ""pass"" pile. No scares at all. I do have to fairly say that the acting was moderately good, but other than that you will just find yourself with yet another dull excursion into the home movie/found footage genre set in yet another cliched location (mental hospital, prison, castle, abandoned church... take your pick - this one's just set in a jungle)... If I had to compare it to anything, it's just another lame Bigfoot-esque found footage movie, set in an Asian jungle.",1416528000,,566,4.90625
5861154,3,B00DW7Y88I,"I really liked this movie,but it could have been 10 times better. The story and acting were quite good,but once again no creature fx. I know a lot of these movies have no budget to speak of,but come on. You don't even see the creature until the last 5 minutes of the film,and then it was very blurry. It looked liked someone in a very poor excuse for an ape suit. I find it hard to believe that the producers could not find some talented individual to do the creature fx for a piece of the action or even a credit at the end. Could have been a four star with a cool looking monster!",1412553600,,582,4.069565217391304
5861155,4,B00DW7Y88I,"Good movie with some decent acting. Another found footage movie. If you like the found footage genre, then take a chance on this one. I notice it has some bad reviews, but I purchased it, and it was worth it.",1410912000,,208,4.225
5861156,4,B00DW7Y88I,"Found footage has become all the rage and thankfully the genre has gotten much better given the glut of poor films that followed on the heels of The Blair Witch Project. This film is very much a slow burn in the style of a Ti West movie. There is a long build up as two Aussie documentarians team up with two native Sumatrans (I think,my apologies for not remembering) to quest for video proof of a very endagered leopard. Success will mean the government will take steps at conservation of the nearly extinct feline. Unfortunately the crew gets reports of a shape shifting witch claiming the mountain as his own turf. This causes a lot of tension between the rest of the team and the tracker assigned to them. The footage is lush and the acting is quite good but the payoff doesn't come until the third act so settle in. When it finally gets to the creature bits I found it to be very effective using suffocating darkness, auditory scares and night vision.",1410480000,3,957,4.505747126436781

5861158,1,B00DW7Y88I,This is one of the worse movie that I had ever seen. This movie was wast of money.,1409356800,,82,3.611111111111111
5861159,4,B00DW7Y88I,"I thought this film was very good for what it was intended to be. The acting was very good and the characters were accurately represented.  The ""Hitchcockian"" style of the script was very effective and although the story line was predictable on the whole.  If you are really into super HD visuals then you probably would not like this film.  However, if you just want to enjoy the suspense without all the sickening gore that film makers seem to push to the limit these days, then ignore the reviews and enjoy this one.",1408060800,,519,4.559139784946237
5861168,1,B00DW7Y88I,What ever they show on the front and back cover is not in the movie. All it is  two men supposed to be the jungle it could be filmed in a back yard. The only creature is a chicken and then its over.  I returned my copy to me it was false advertising.,1406505600,2,250,3.69811320754717
5861169,1,B00DW7Y88I,"If I had known it was a ""found-footage"" film I would not have bought it, as I cannot stand this mode of film making and the herky-jerky technique.  As for the movie itself - pure garbage.  Unlike me, save your money.  I could have done a better job with my video camera without the expense of any of the crew on this film.  I'm serious.  What a waste of time and money, especially my time and my money.",1406505600,2,402,4.102564102564102
5861170,1,B00DW7Y88I,"I bought this based on the strength of Traucki's first two films--Black Water and The Reef, both of which i thought were extremely effective and wonderfully suspenseful.  They weren't exactly groundbreaking in the realm of originality, but they were well-done enough to be entertaining, interesting, and provide a great sense of dread and some genuine scares.  The moment I saw he directed The Jungle, I was on board, and that was a HUGE mistake.

I don't know how a movie this bad happened from a director who has done so much better.  I actually LIKE found footage films, so that wasn't working against the movie for me.  What does work against it is how incredibly derivative and lacking in imagination the film is.  It's essentially The Blair Witch Project in a Jungle instead of the woods if the documentarians had been looking for an actual animal and found the Blair Witch by accident.  So little happens that it just begins to drag.  While that can be a tool for building suspense when done right, it just turns into a drawn out affair that become insufferable.

When something finally DOES happen, there's not much tension or fear in it.  Most of the shots of the monster are far too fast, and while sometimes the inability to see the creature can work in a film's favor (remember how little you saw the shark in Jaws?  or how you never actually SEE the Blair Witch ever in that movie?), the handling of the reveal is done poorly, and the actual reveal itself looks like someone threw a stuffed animal at he camera while overdubbing scary growling sounds.  Basically, if you remember the show at all, it's kind of like Zoboomafoo with rabies.

I almost never regret watching a horror movie.  I will sit through just about anything at least once and find something to like about it.  I spent a good share of he second half of this one catching up on email on my cell phone, glad to be in the comfort of my living room, not because it helped the movie be less frightening, but because I didn't have to worry about my phone bothering anyone else.  This is worse than a bad movie--bad movies are at least entertaining.  This one is just boring.  Skip it.",1404604800,2,2159,4.5636363636363635
5861171,1,B00DW7Y88I,"At 1:20:07, something slightly scary happened.

Then the movie ended.

I have seen many movies over the past 5 decades, and none of them were this boring.",1404518400,5,154,4.666666666666667
5861172,4,B00DW7Y88I,"It's Paranormal Activity in the jungle. I really enjoyed this film which is one of the found footage type movies I love so much. This one had me on the edge of my seat. People are complaining that they can only see flashes of the monster, but that's the point. That's what makes the scare factor of the movie. You only are allowed to see the creature this way. I'm going to watch this one many times. As I always say in my reviews, forget what everybody else is saying and make your own opinion.",1404345600,2,495,4.221052631578948
5861173,1,B00DW7Y88I,"This movie is a scam!  Nothing happens.  Four foolish actors with one camera shoot endless footage of jungle bushes, they hear noises and the selfish stupid leader of the exhibition to save extinct leopards insists on dragging everyone into the woods in search of creatures we never see.  The only monsters in this film are the producers and directors and hard up actors who would sell their souls to make a movie.  Shame on all involved in making this film!  And shame on all of us who were duped by the false advertisement into buying it.",1403913600,2,540,4.583333333333333
5861174,1,B00DW7Y88I,"The consistently low budget, generally hand held camerawork with a narrow field of view makes for a terrible watching experience and the fake documentary storytelling style makes for a lot of boring scenes.

5861175,1,B00DW7Y88I,"I love monster movies!  Bought this one based on the great looking monster and soldier on back cover.  Most of the movie you don't see a monster...no soldiers, and at the very end you get a flash of the ""monster,"" which didn't look AT ALL like the back pictue.  Felt very let down and feel this is real close to false advertising!  Save your money and buy ""Bait"" (shark) instead!",1403827200,5,379,4.371428571428571
5861176,1,B00DW7Y88I,"The packaging leads you to believe you are going to see a real movie, instead you get another of these ""found footage"" pieces of garbage.  If I had known this I wouldn't have even bothered getting it.  I am so tired of these movies it is ridiculous.  So called ""film makers""  think they can take a very thin storyline and some cameras and hooray we have art.  Enough griping.  Very little plot, never see the creature,  A lot of running around in the jungle hearing noises.  A lot of arguing about going back.  It felt like the last third of the film was running around in the dark waving flashlights.  Everybody dies.  Same old thing.  Please save your money!
Unless of course your into fumbling around camera work in the dark where you can't see anything--then this is just up your alley.",1403568000,5,790,4.485915492957746
5861177,3,B00DW7Y88I,"I watched this in Region 2 but the version being offered here is Region 3 so unless you have an all region player you may not be able to view this.

We have all had a fright or two from `found tape' horrors; it all began with `The Blair Witch Project' or BWP as we now know it. This one is from Andrew Traucki who brought us the Croc shock `Blackwater' and Shark fest `The Reef'. Well this time he tries to do similar in the jungle.

So we meet big cat conservationist Larry Black - he heads off to the jungles of Indonesia to track the near extinct Javan leopard or is that Javenese? He is accompanied by his documentary film making brother - Ben. Once there they employ two guides to take them to find their quarry. Along the way they realise that they are being tracked by something and so the tables are turned. Now being a found tape film this means we have a lot of half filmed shots, the cameras always seem to have a glitch when the monster - or whatever it is supposed to be- gets to have any screen time.

I actually found this a bit lack lustre; the moments of tension or `fright' were cancelled by the lack of anything happening, it is just too slow. Also Larry is really unlikable - the sort of guy who is always gonna get other people into trouble and is always right into the bargain. That may have been necessary as a plot device but you need to like the characters to care or at least have some empathy and I could do neither. To be honest I would not have been over bothered if he had become lunch for the monster thing.

Now the real criticism is the cover art, where we can see some sort of monster but do not let that fool you, I think in the few seconds of screen time I might have seen a fang - oh there is a claw scene too. There are attempts to get the viewer back especially towards the end of this 85 minute offering, but I think my attention had started to drift. Still this is not a bad film per se, it just could have been a lot better. I will still give his next offering a go though.",1393718400,,2015,4.055276381909548
8598645,3,B00DW7Y88I,"the movie is very boring, actually to call it a movie is an exaggeration, there is really no plot whatsoever and
if you don't like the jungle scenes you will probably fall asleep.  You will probably fall asleep anyway.  The cover

I wasn't expecting The Godfather, however, I was expecting at least a few entertaining moments.

8598648,4,B00DW7Y88I,"For clarification, I always rate found footage movies higher than they deserve, not to mess up my recommendations.
I also rate them in relation to similar movies instead of say, The Godfather, which is obviously not in danger of being dethroned by any Horror movie.
With all of that being said, it's a solid 3 in the genre.
High quality production for a found footage movie with good character development. Slow burn 30-40 minute beginning as in all similar titles.
Not a big payoff in the end but was enjoyable and worth the rent, especially if you're in the mood and have watched all of the great ones already.",1501977600,,612,4.623853211009174
