1696591,1,B000063W59,"I saw GIANT SPIDER INVASION double billed with AT THE EARTH'S CORE when it was first released at a drive-in in 1975; I was 6 years old.  I finally had the opportunity to see this again almost 3 decades later.  Basically this film is a total failure, but don't let that deter you if you have a taste for 70's B-Movie fare.  Highlights are Alan Hale(""Hi little buddy!!"")and in one seen where you can actually see the microphone moving from side to side at the bottom of the screen.

1696592,4,B000063W59,"Back from the shadows of cheaply made monster movies incorporating a few scares (actually, this had one scare - and I was intoxicated so I'm not certain it was truly meritable of the term ""frightening"") and a lot of laughs (As the back of the movie's case implies, the ""Spider effects"" is actually a VW disguised as a Giant Spider from Outer Space, plus there are some laughable yokel mating rituals.) comes The Giant Spider Invasion.  It basically adheres to the old monster movie principles, the cheaper the monster and the thinner the reasoning, the better.
Here we have the story of a small Wisconsin town that experiences an unknown object plummeting to Earth, landing close to the farmhouse of the unsavory Dan and Ev Kester. Upon closer inspection of the impact site, the Kesters find droves of their livestock mutilated and worry about what did it, too, until they discover geodes filled with what look to be diamonds - and a more sinister eight-legged cargo that is initially overlooked. Enter the NASA scientists and their loosely scientific hypothesis that states that the crash site is actually a ""black hole"" emanating energy feeding some soon to be gigantic spiders and you have a truly fun-filled, barely budgeted monster movie!
Be forewarned that the plot is thin, the actors (with the exception of Alan Hale AKA ""The Skipper"") are subpar, and the effects are almost nonexistent. Knowing this ahead of time, however, leaves you room to enjoy this flashback to an enjoyable time in ""horror"" cinema. Buy it and experience VW love once again!",1025481600,8,1555,4.91254752851711

Marry a plot of cosmic, vaguely Lovecraftian proportions to 50s-style scientists and moist hillbilly sex, greed and booze domestic drama, fold in the afore-mentioned motorized monster Muppet and serve it all up on a budget that wouldn't get you an extra topping on a pizza - and you begin to comprehend the sleazy splendor that is Giant Spider Invasion. So where the heck do the 3 stars come from? For starters - from the very elements noted above. Viewers with a appreciation for the tart taste of trash know the film delivers a full course meal. This disc received an additional 2 stars by offering folks outside of North East Ohio an introduction to Son of Ghoul, a horror host for over 16 years in the Cleveland area, who kicks off the disc with a wild and wooley trip to the car wash. It seems his sidekick, Fidge, is bedeviled by dandruff, and an industrial strength shower is the only way to take care of the problem.

1696623,4,B000063W59,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Let me say up front that this movie is not a cinematic achievement that film historians will be discussing over the next 100 years. No, it is not the CITIZEN KANE of giant critter flicks. What it is though is a lot of fun and thanks to VCI it is now available on blu-ray.

Film has changed with each passing decade and the most wonderful thing about movies in the 60s, 70s and into the early 80s was that low budget independent movies could be made and actually be found playing in theaters, mostly drive-ins, across the country. A small group of talented (or not talented) individuals could come together on a relatively small budget and make an actual movie. But times changed with the advent of video and now DVD and those movies rarely show on a big screen and almost always go straight to video if they get made at all. But those gems of the past are now making their way to this new format for movie fans to enjoy.

The movie opens with a meteor crashing in the field of farmer Dan (Robert Easton) and his wife Ev (Leslie Parrish). Talk about a dysfunctional family, Dan is a philandering husband hitting the local hooker at night, Ev is an alcoholic and Evs sister Terry is a teenage tease whos dating local newspaper reporter while taunting Dan. Dan and Ev see the meteor in the sky and decide to check it out the next morning.

At the same time local scientist Dr. Jenny Langer (Barbara Hale) has noted some strange readings and contacted NASA who send out Dr. Vance (Steve Brodie) to investigate. Most of their time is spent discussing the scientific questions revolving around the strange readings Langer got as well as those from NASA before they go out to investigate at Dans ranch.

Its not long before we discover that what seemed a meteor was actually a method for an invasion of spiders that start normal size but eventually grow to the size of a small car (a Volkswagen draped in a welded frame and outfitted to look like a giant spider was used). In addition to plenty of webbing walked through we get the giant spider eating any and all it comes in contact with while both doctors try and find a way to get rid of the pesky critter.

While this may not qualify as a classic such as THEM it does have a certain amount of charm to it. Those who would make note of the bad acting here are missing the point. This is not an award winning film and never intended to be. Instead it was a low budget horror film that was intended to open doors and be a part of a resume. The fact that it made so much money on such a miniscule budget (by Hollywood standards) shows that there was a definite market for movies like this at the time. As noted in the extras even Johnny Carson mentioned the film on his show due to the amount of money it made.

VCI has dusted off the movie to offer the cleanest presentation available for fans of both the film and of low budget horror flicks. If you fall into those categories you won't be disappointed. Not only do you get the best reproduction of the film there are plenty of extras as well. Included are a new documentary on the film by Daniel Griffith, a super-8 version of the film transferred to HD, a behind the scenes gallery if photos, the original trailer and TV spots, interviews with members of the cast and crew, a newsreel, an 18 track recording of the upcoming stage musical based on the film and more. VCI have gone out of their way to satisfy the fans of the film.

This is the sort of movie that you put on after popping a bowl of popcorn, grabbing your favorite beverage of choice and plopping your feet up in the recliner to sit back and have a laugh with. It won't alter your life or ask you to join some misguided organization that wants to save spiders. What it could possibly do is have you consider buying a home theater projector to sit up on the back porch come summer so you can watch movies like this they was they were intended, under a starry night listening through a tinny speaker and having a blast. One last note is the appearance of Alan Hale, the Captain of GILLIGANS ISLAND, playing the town sheriff in what amounts to a cameo role. Just another great reason to pick up this movie.",1456876800,,4220,4.346446700507614
1696624,4,B000063W59,"I noticed a LOT of reviews, here, THEN, noticed that NOBODY actually BOUGHT the---newly restored---Blu-ray of the monster movie with the title creature being an old VOLKSWAGON.
The Sheriff (GILLIGAN'S ISLANDS' Alan Hale, Jr.), answers the phone a lot!
The hillbilly red long-johns actor---that aged VERY well since his multiple appearance in old '50s shows, like THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN did a great job being a sexual preditor.
Barbara Hale (NO relation to ALAN [formerly on PERRY MASON]) as Dr. Jenny Langer, the only smart woman in this movie.
While this movie DID have a LIMITED BUDGET, it is entertaining.
This flick comes with:
1.) Blu-ray version.... with bonuses.
2.) DVD version [also]with bonuses.
3.) CD soundtrack of newly recorded spoof-songs.
4.) A mini-comic book.",1455840000,5,781,5.256
1696635,4,B000063W59,"I purchased this movie because I remembered these humongous spiders attacking people from when I was a teenager watching ""Midnight Theatre"" on the weekends and at that time I thought it was pretty funny and wild. While I still enjoy this crazy and silly, classic sci-fi film I am reducing it to 4 stars because there is some language in the movie. While a whole lot of people today give no importance to inappropriate language or have different ideas of what appropriate or inappropriate language is I am leaving this comment only for those who are concerned about language.

I have noticed throughout my movie purchases on Amazon that a lot of the time there is no language rating given and people rarely ever speak about bad language in movies anymore. Generally movies made prior to the 1970s have no bad language because it was considered inappropriate and not allowed back then but moving into the 1970s bad language was seeping in and increasing as the years neared the 1980s.

So to whomever may be wondering about bad language in this movie, well there is some. The bad language is not real prevalent but it is there. I never counted how many times I heard it. I try to forget hearing it at all. Why on earth the writers, producers, directors, or whomever is responsible for allowing it ever allows it at all is beyond me because it only degrades the movies.

Aside from the occasional bad words, I still enjoy watching these great big spiders attacking people. Umm, sounds kind of strange. lol! What is it that is fun about watching some crazy movie that is creepy and scary? Food for thought- well, I expect that with the knowledge known about radiation today that such things may be possible if left in the wrong hands.",1453334400,2,1730,4.647058823529412
1696636,5,B000063W59,"The title, THE GIANT SPIDER INVASION tells you everything you need to know about this great film. The opening shows the denizens of a small hick town engaged in various activities. There's a big revival meeting going on at the local church, while those not attending it are busy fooling around w/ their neighbors' spouses. Simultaneously, a fiery meteor crash-lands nearby. Oh no! That was no ordinary space-rock! Cue the poorly-used military stock footage. Enter Sheriff What's-his-name (Alan Hale Jr.!), answering his phone like nobody's business! Cue the hillbilly in his long-johns and back-brace! Yee-haw! Cue the banjos! Meanwhile, government-types attempt to get to the bottom of the meteor mystery. Enter Barbara Hale as Dr. Jenny Langer, the only woman in this movie w/ a functioning brain. Uh-oh, hillbilly back-brace man has put on some clothing, just in time to discover that something's been eating his cows! Yep, he's got himself a GIANT SPIDER problem. As part of his daily routine, the sheriff sits in various locations. Terror erupts. THE GIANT SPIDER INVASION is one of those 70's monster movies that'll pop your brain-cells like so much bubble wrap! One of the main problems is the slllooowww build-up, before anything actually happens. The big arachnids themselves are so poorly realized as to rival the hilarity generated by the ""acting"" of the humans involved! Made entirely of cheeeze, TGSI rates a perfect 10 on the cinematic pain scale! Like its cousin, SQUIRM, this movie is a triumph of bottom-of-the-cesspool film-making. The gargantuan spider is truly a wonder to behold, making a hideous sound that can only be described as bear-claws-down-a-chalkboard!

1696639,5,B000063W59,"Thanksgiving is a time when we gather with friends and family, enjoy a great meal, and reflect upon all the things we're thankful for. One thing that we're extremely thankful for is the fine art of B that has transformed our beings. With that thought we figured ""why not incorporate some B early in the Thanksgiving day?"" Once that was established we wondered what kind of B would be perfect? Light-hearted yet entertaining seemed ideal. You don't want anything too heavy to disrupt your cheerful mood. Then MST3K came to mind and the rest is history. After watching Giant Spider Invasion it became clear that this will be part of the annual tradition from here on out. The combination of B, football, and a great meal is a staple in our heritage and must be continued for years to come. Honestly, do you ever really need an excuse to watch a horrible movie?

The Giant Spider Invasion takes place in North Wisconsin...GO PACK!...in a town that's thriving with some of the finest back-woods hicks to ever grace the silver screen. Our main hillbilly and his drunk wife are arguing outside when a beam of light crashes down behind their house. Turns out this explosion was a black hole from another dimension that touched down in middle America. This black hole unleashes a gang of spiders lead by one giant beast that looked like it took about 20 minutes to whip up. The thing looks like it was made from giant pipe cleaners. The rest of the spiders are tarantulas...which apparently are of alien origin. The town looks to the Sheriff, who is horribly acted by the Skipper, to take down the alien spider race. The skipper couldn't manage to get the SS Minnow up and running after being deserted, so how do you think he'd fare against the spider invasion? Not well would be the answer as he gets eaten while the dumb Wisconsin hicks run around for their lives. NASA has to then step in and create a bomb to take out the man eating spiders saving the Packers and the cheese factory.

Thanks to the jokers at MST3K this movie was a 5 star success with plenty of laughs. If this film is watched in it's original form you will probably attempt to hang yourself half way through. Once again it's the jokes that keep this one alive. The multiple references to the Packers, Brett Q, and hicks were a thing of beauty. As always, whenever you lace a movie with rednecks you are guaranteed to get some great results. We implore you to incorporate some MST3K into your Thanksgiving morning if at all possible. It's the perfect way to start your day. It mellows you out before Santa fires up his antics and you have to make him sit at the kids table. Even when he's challenging you to a feats of strength over making the gravy, you can reflect back to your movie viewing morning and laugh it away.",1353542400,2,2783,4.530815109343936
1696640,3,B000063W59,"There is no doubt this movie is laughable in most every respect.  It does have both decent and terrible acting, bad special effects, and is in serious need of remastering.  But on the other hand if you're a fan of creature movies--especially low budget 'B'--well, ok 'Z' movies--this might be for you.  It's fun and entertaining, and the plot could be worse--I rather enjoyed it.  Just turn off your brain, sit on your intelligence, so to speak--as you would with, say, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.  It has nothing to do with the movie being from the 70s; the 70s were a great decade for cinema in many respects, if not the BEST decade; just don't cite this movie as an example of 70s cinema (please don't!).",1350259200,,710,4.559055118110236

All I remember is there were about 10 people in the theater and some of them were smoking (what I don't recall).
I'm even more ashamed to admit I ran out of the theater during the secne where a woman runs to a barn and a giant spider (or stuffed pillow being pushed) attacks her. You see, I was and still am terrfied of spiders and coupled with the fact that I was 6 I ran like a fool. My dad failed to convince me to go back in so we left. He later thanked me for him not having to watch any more of the film.
I am proud that we got MST3000 to air this by request and they destroyed it which was awesome!
All these years later I finally have this abysmal disgrace on DVD and to say the least I'm not scared-only by the fact that this somehow played theaters! Still, what a glorious time when a pathetic film such as this could actually get into a theater.

1696643,2,B000063W59,"Like many, I enjoy a good bad movie, and this one is legendarily bad. This ""director's cut"" has some very subtle edits from the version most of us might have been used to from ""MST3K"", most notably the insertion of some stock military footage at the beginning of the movie (which adds nothing), the mysterious removal of Alan Hale's ""Hi little buddy!"", and a few other minor edits. There is also a very brief snippet of nudity, completely gratuitous and not especially interesting. The picture is a bit sharper than other versions I've seen, but the transfer is horrible, making the picture jumpy, almost like watching an old filmstrip. Some of the supplemental material is mildly interesting at first, but becomes tedious very quickly. In particular, home videos of efforts to find and retrieve the original giant spider out of the woods of northern Wisconsin were raw footage and nearly unwatchable. From here, the documentary-type footage became sad as friends of Bill Rebane and fans of the movie try to raise funds to restore the spider and nobody else shows any interest. The multiple interviews with Rebane, and his commentary during the film, add nothing of any real substance. In short, this version is probably of interest only to hard-core fans.",1277424000,,1256,4.957345971563981

Alan Hale is lovable as the town sheriff and Steve Brodie does his best to be the leading man who is the scientist who will save the day.  Barbara Hale is the only half believable character as an astronomy professor who has a clue, while everyone else just bellows and whines in frustration.  This movie will leave you laughing at some of the residents who are carrying on in their rural peyton place (Robert Easton is particularly repulsive as Dan Kester, a man who looks as if he has not bathed in a month, but he shows how talented he is to those who are familiar with his previous work).

Id keep any release of this movie at this point.
This is a 2 disc set - and they discs are silver and not DVDr. There are some great bonus features on the 2nd disc(interviews,etc). Plus the first disc has commentary.

The back says Synergy Entertainment & MVD Visual. Obviously MVD had it ready for release & cancelled it at the last min. Then Synergy picked it up & released it. Synergy known for releasing cheap DVDR's this is great & amazing MVD Visual are the original manufactures so that's why we get the real deal silver DVD's I am shocked this was even released on DVD again by itself for the second time. The second Disc has over 2 hrs. worth of bonus features! amazing stuff some of the bonus material was on the 2006 Academy Of Video Arts rare release 2-Disc DVD-R Set called ""The Giant Spider Invasion Revisited 30th Anniversary 2-Disc"" That one has an audio commentary also which goes with the Theatrical Cut. So now I got 2 different commentaries! The Bonus features the this new 2009 release one is much better quality. Also alot of the stuff has the same footage though here it is longer & complete. Like when Mr. Rebane takes big fan Corey J. Udler into the woods to show him the remains of the metal spider frame. The footage is longer here. Seems I get alot more extras too that I have never seen on this new 2-Disc! Disc 1 has the movie a nice clean crisp film print of the movie The Director's Cut it runs about 76 mins. & some seconds. Which I don't understand Director's Cuts are supposed to be longer then the theatrical cuts. The 2002 Retromedia DVD Release which I also own, runs a little under 80 mins. Same version which is on the 30th Anniversary Revisited 2-Disc DVD-R Set. This version on the 2009 release I have never seen. Always ran into copies of the other a little under 80 mins. The back of the DVD Case says 84 mins. which is wrong I have always seen that screw up run time said about the film for either version. Also states ""Plus 112 mins. of bonus extras"". Which I checked it was 2 hrs. & 16 mins. worth. I just ran through the Discs didn't really watch them yet will soon though. This has to be my favorite Cult Movie of all time! I have all 4 different DVD releases of it. In 2005 it was released as part of the 2-Disc Collection ""Invasion Of Terror"" Which featured that & another Sci-Fi Cult Classic from Rebane ""Invasion From Inner Earth"" released in 1974. Nice copy of that too & has a choice of 2.0 Stereo or 5.1 Surround same with Spider Invasion on that one. Brentwood Home Video put these out, also includes 2 other films that are Horror Movies not from Bill Rebane though. They are both doubled sided discs. This new 2009 one here also we get on Disc 1 a Slide Show Image Gallery & a feature length audio commentary with Producer/Director Mr. Bill Rebane with someone in the background asking him questions a bit. I admire this man so much for what he went through without a script & during the production of the movie. Also not only that. I really like his films I have seen all his 70's Sci-Fi Flicks also own them all. I have yet to see his 80's Horror Efforts. Obviously too have seen Monster A-Go Go (1965) which Mr. Hershell Gordon Lewis finished & ruined cause Rebane didn't have the money to finish it. I like Hershell's Films also. But I like Rebane's better. Didn't really care for Monster A-Go Go, all that much it was alright though. Spider Invasion is my favorite of Rebane's films. Cause of what he went through during the production. More so cause it is a homage or throwback to 50's Sci-Fi Giant Spider Films. On Disc 2 we get a neat condensed 8mm Version of the film. This 2-Disc is well worth the 18 something I payed for via amazon.com  This King Of Cult Classic Films finally gets it's just goods & they are delivered fantastically here! For u movie fans this film isn't as bad as some may think. I have seen worse Low-Budget Sci-Fi & Horror Efforts. Made for around 300,000 Dollars it went on to Gross over 24 Million Dollars how is that for a Drive-Inn Low-Budget Sci-Fi Picture? Most say that's amazing! Johnny Carson mentioned it on one of his shows back in 1975. U probably already know it was in the Top 50 Grossing Films of 1975. What else can I say get this 2-Disc, it won't be around too long. Well worthy DVD Set for a great Cult Classic still admired today!",1240790400,,4277,4.373115577889447
1696669,1,B000063W59,"The Giant Spider Invasion (Bill Rebane, 1975)

I have to give props to any movie in which Alan Hale, Jr., plays a sheriff, and has ""Well hi, little buddy!"" as his first spoken line. That should tell you right there that this movie has no pretensions whatsoever at being serious. If you persist in thinking so, however, this movie will put paid to that many, many times during its dreadful hour and a half running time; it's just too stupid for words.

The labyrinthine, yet simple-minded, plot involves spiders emerging from geodes studded with diamonds. Yes, I'm serious. (And yet somehow only one person in the movie becomes aware that if you can get past the spiders, you can make a fortune.) There's a slightly worse problem in that when the spiders are left unchecked, they tend to grow. How big? Oh, to about the size of a VW Bug with eight mechanically-waving legs attached. (You can see the Bug in a scene or two.) To make it even better, the cast is a who's-who of bad television-- Barbara Hale, Steve Brodie, Robert Easton (whose character, an alcoholic pedophile, is the only really creepy thing about the movie), and Leslie Parrish, augmented with softcore star Diane Lee Hart (as the object of Easton's character's affection). With a stable of acting talent like that, the question is not how you can go wrong, but how you can go right. Top it off with a bottom-of-the-barrel script (co-written by Easton, which makes his character even creepier) and truly lame direction from schlockmeister Bill Rebane, best-remembered these days for Blood Harvest (starring Tiny Tim as an insane clown), and you've got perfect Mystery Science Theater 3000 material. Me? I saw it played straight. Pity me. *",1223596800,,1705,4.815699658703072
1696670,2,B000063W59,"Poorly acted, a lot of dead screen time where the director seems to be just tickeing off the footage, this mid-70's turkey is watchable only for how bad it is. Alan ""Skipper"" Hale from Gilligans Island shows up as a local sherrif in a town plagued by an invasion of arachanoids. Funny as hell this film tried to pass off a fur covered VW Beetle (complete with arms!) as a spider. I know it was tough going before CGI, but if the cast and crew got through this without laughing hard at themselves, they truly have no humor in their DNA...",1190851200,,537,4.326732673267327
1696671,3,B000063W59,"The title's a bit ambiguous, isn't it?  I mean, is this a giant invasion of spiders, or is it an invasion by a single giant spider?  As it turns out, it's a little bit of both.  It's also a pretty lousy B-movie ripe for heckling, as the boys at MST3K certainly proved - in retrospect, this one was almost too easy.  When you start the dialogue with Alan ""Skipper"" Hale greeting a visitor to his sheriff's office with the words ""little buddy,"" you know this isn't going to be an exercise in mental acuity.  If you've never seen any of the Gilligan's Island gang in their post-Gilligan movie careers, consider yourself lucky because it isn't pretty (although nothing can approach the ignominy of Jim Backus in Angels' Revenge - a film that also featured Alan Hale).

This film takes place in the ultra-exciting surroundings of the Wisconsin countryside.  Apparently, the big invasion either got off-course or the invaders were looking for easy pickings (or perhaps they just really, really like cheese).  The invaders have a fairly explosive arrival, but no one seems to care very much - except the sheriff, who quickly gets annoyed with all the reports of cars and electrical gizmos suddenly not working that night.  The next day, the biggest rube in Wisconsin finally meanders out into his field to find some mutilated cows and mysterious rocks.  These rocks start turning up everywhere, and - amazingly - no one seems to notice the fact that really hairy spiders crawl out of the things when they finally burst.  A local scientist does care about all of the unusual scientific readings she is suddenly getting in the area, and her reports encourage NASA to send out a greasy scientist to see what's what.  The two of them come up with a cockamamie story about a black hole hitting the earth spewing out alien spiders.  I guess that's one way to explain the sudden spider infestation and, eventually, the appearance of the mother of all spiders to terrorize the local yokels.

Nothing much really happens until the gigantic spider finally turns up.  Sure, it's obviously just a VW bug in disguise, but I think it does look fairly impressive making its way just over yon hill toward town.  In at least one respect, it does have a deadly aspect to it, as several crew members were almost killed during filming.  Perhaps the scariest character in the film, however, is the fiery preacher who pops up from time to time, mainly as a vehicle for the sheriff's constantly bad jokes.

If you enjoy old B-movie monster movies, you might actually get a kick out of Giant Spider Invasion - well, probably not, but at least you'll pretty much know what to expect (which is not much).  How can you resist a campy giant spider movie, though?",1140825600,2,2727,4.703157894736842
1696672,1,B000063W59,"Bad.  That's the only way to say it.  This movie is ""no-budget"" film making trying to make an effects extravaganza.  And failing.  The movie includes the infamous VW Bug as the giant bug, the ""hi-tech"" science lab which seems to be in high school biology classroom, untold shots of basically meaningless shadows and darkness, and the Skipper from Gilligan's Island as the ""comic relief"" -- read: spouting corny jokes.  The film can be enjoyed two ways: (1) Enjoy the hokiness in the way B-movie can.  (2) Watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version.  The MST3K version is hilarious!  This version features hilarious running commentary pointing such details as ""Lab provided by Mrs. Johnson's class,""  or ""'But, You can't see anything in this shot!'  Be quiet film school grad!

1696673,2,B000063W59,"I've always enjoyed a good enormous insect devouring the Earth film, with some of my favorites being Them! (1954), The Black Scorpion (1957), and even Empire of the Ants (1977), but The Giant Spider Invasion (1975), while having its' moments, barely rates as a blip on the silver screen, or any screen, comparatively speaking.  Directed by Bill Rebane, whose other credits include Monster a-Go Go (1965) and The Capture of Bigfoot (1979), stars Steve Brodie as NASA scientist J.R. Vance.  Now, Brodie looked familiar, but I couldn't recall what other films I've seen him in until I looked up his bio and saw such cinematic flotsam as The Wild World of Batwoman (1966) and Jerry Warren's Frankenstein Island (1981)...ugh...I'm still reeling from that last one.  The film also stars Barbara Hale (from TV's Perry Mason) as Dr. Jenny Langer, character actor Robert Easton, and Alan Hale Jr. aka the skipper from Gilligan's Island...oh man, I feel a serious cinematic hurting coming on...

The film starts out with some kind of foreign object traveling to Earth, crashing spectacularly on Dan Kester's farm in Hicksville, Wisconsin (okay, the town wasn't named Hicksville, but it shoulda been, given the complete idiotic, backwoods nature of the residents we've met so far).  Shortly after impact of the extraterrestrial object, residents begin reporting problems with radios and televisions, but that's the extent of incident.  No one really seems to have noticed that a fairly large object from outer space has slammed into a Wisconsin pasture, and even the farmer puts off investigating until the next day.  A scientist, Dr. Langer, working at the local observatory does report strange and unusual readings to NASA...to which they dispatch Dr. Vance to investigate.  The following day Kester and his alcoholic wife decide to investigate the strange happening at their farm, and discover a number of cattle have been partially eaten.  They also find the impact site, and a number of geodes around the area.  After breaking one open, they find what appears to be diamonds inside, and dreams of wealth begin to swirl in their heads.  What they missed was the spider that popped out of the geode, and scurried off to do whatever it is spiders do...soon the spiders begin to make frequent appearances, creeping and crawling all over the place.  And not just wee, bitty spiders but great big uns, too...and they appear to be hungry.  After several townspeople get all et up in a particularly gruesome fashion by the biggest spider (I tell you, he's fifty feet tall if he's a foot!), Dr. Langer and Dr. Vance postulate that the object that crashed to Earth opened up a portal to an alternate universe, one that is populated by spiders, and they are now coming through this portal to Earth.  That seems like quite a presumption, but since Vance is a NASA scientist, who am I to argue?  Anyway, various plans begin to formulate, with the scientists looking for a way to close the portal, and local yokels forming gun-toting mobs to hunt down the giant spider what et up their kin.  After getting to know the various residents of this small farming community, I formulated my own plan...let the spiders gorge themselves on these knuckleheads, and then perform a tactical nuclear strike on the community.  Do they manage to stop the invasion of voracious interstellar arachnids?  Or are we all doomed to become space spider sweet meats?

Okay, first of all the effects are really shoddy, but I that doesn't automatically make a film bad.  If the acting, script, dialog, direction and/or characters are decent, I can let poor effects slide, especially in the context of low budget filmmaking (the cost of the film was about $250,000 to $300,000).  Well, guess what?  Most of those elements were pretty shoddy as well...I will say that it did look like a lot of effort and heart were put into this rather doomed production, but it seemed the director was never able to muster anything near the overall impact he was looking for, as I think this was a definite case of over reaching ones' limitations, specifically in the budget department.  Alan Hale Jr. makes a few appearances throughout the film as the sheriff, but he spends more time in his office than anything else, making some of the lamest jokes you've ever heard.  You can tell the writer tried to inject a comic element into the script, but mostly these elicited a great deal of groaning from this viewer.  The funniest elements were the ones not meant to be funny, like the giant spider (it's actually a VW bug with fake legs attached), the theories thrown about by the scientists, and just the general character development.  In many scenes real, smaller, spiders were used, and certainly provided many creeps, but what I found even creepier was the casual notion of relations of a biblical nature between some of the characters who where related to each other...none of this was shown, but it was eluded to, and given the characters involved, it was certainly not great stretch of the imagination.  (Things that make you go `ewwwww')

Fred Olen Ray's Retromedia Entertainment provides a decent full screen print (about as good as a VHS copy) here with some noticeable wear and tear at a couple of spots.  A real plus is the inclusion of some pretty good special features like an introduction by Akron, Ohio's Son of Ghoul, a mini reproduction of a four page comic book put out at the time of the film's release, a theatrical trailer for the film, and an interview with director Bill Rebane in which he basically points out the weaknesses in his film, lack of money, too many producers (five, at one point), and lack of a decent script, to name a few.  Despite my criticisms, I am happy to know that someone out there is releasing films like this on DVD.

Talon: Beyond all the long phone conversations, the bad acting, the terrible development, the dumb science, and the limited time we saw the giant spider...

...this movie still sucks.

Joe: The giant spider, which was actually a Volkswagen covered in fake black fur, was a joy to behold. Whether it's worth sitting through the running time to see it in action depends on how high you are.

Talon: Put ISHTAR back in.

But don't put ZAAT back in. That movie makes me want cut off my arms and fall from a great height.

Joe: I hate ZAAT like I hate poverty and disease.

Talon: Here's some of the dialog my dad and I had while viewing. Try to imagine some of our phrases as catchy slogans:

""I've never seen a movie with more people talking on the phone.""

""All small towns have a rock shop.""

""The bush blew up the motorcycle.""

""If they cut every scene with people talking on the phone, this movie would be eight minutes long.""

""Is that his sister? Is Dutch trying to nail his sister?""

""Paul looks a lot like Charles Manson.""
""Hey, don't talk about Paul like that. That guy rocks.""

""Is that car a Dodge Dart?""
""No, its a hatch back.""
""Oh.""

""Is that a Dodge Dart?""
""No.""
""Oh.""

""Hey, I think that's a Dodge Dart.""
""Oh my god.""

""That giant spider is actually pretty cool.""
""Is it? I ripped out my own eyes twenty minutes ago.""
