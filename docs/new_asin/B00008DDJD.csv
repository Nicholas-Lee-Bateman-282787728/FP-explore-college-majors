1834716,5,B00008DDJD,"Leslie Sansone finally came out with a walk that exceeds her 3 mile tape (which I worked up to being able to finish with ease after a few weeks.)  It takes about 56 minutes to do the 4 mile walk, that is about 9 minutes longer than the 3 mile walk from the 1/2/3 WATP series, so there is a somewhat faster pace most notably in the second mile.

No weights or special devices are needed in this workout which is great.  There is more attention to arm/upper body in this tape than in the 1/2/3 series.  While there are no new ""moves"" per se, there are variations on the basics WATP steps in miles 3 and 4 which add interest and engage the muscles differently.

There is adequate warm-up and cool-down time.  The weird hip-hop-esque music is the only thing I didn't love about the tape and even that changes to regular exercise music after the first mile.

I would *HIGHLY* recommend this tape to anyone familiar with Leslie's previous tapes seeking a greater challenge.  It would also be suitable for anyone who wants to settle into a 1-hour in-home walking regimen even if they have not done Leslie's earlier tapes; viewers can always modify the intensity at which they walk or stop before the end of the tape as long as a cool-down is done.

TIPS for the true couch potato: if your TV has a ""picture in picture"" capability, once you watch this a couple of times you can workout to this tape while playing another program simultaneously.  I used to not be able to finish the 1 mile and now I do at least an hour of in-home exercise to video tapes daily with the 4 mile WATP as one of my mainstays- it is so convenient.  For any sedentary person who is on the fence about the WATP series- it feels so much better to be active than not.  This program allows you to breath hard a sweat (if you choose to work at that intensity) without jumping around.  You feel lighter, stronger and in a better mood within a few workouts.  If you can force yourself to do it everyday for about 3 weeks, even if you cannot finish it or cannot work at an intensity where you  breath hard & sweat, working out will at least become second nature to you, you'll look forward to working out and get a glimpse of some of the longer-term rewards like suddenly being able to advance much farther into the tape than you could just a day or two before, breathing easier at higher activity levels, breaking your first good sweat, clothes fitting a little looser.  I cannot WAIT for a 5 mile equivalent at less than 60 minutes to come out!",1055030400,118,2507,4.347639484978541
1834717,5,B00008DDJD,"The ""Super Challenge"" DVD is a great addition for in-home walkers. If you are a veteran of the Walk Away the Pounds workouts and you're looking for the next level of working out, this is your DVD.
Leslie uses steps that are easy to follow, this is not about aerobic dancing. The steps on this DVD are:
- Walking (of course!)
- Side Steps (single and double)
- Knee Lifts
- Kicks
- Kick backs (leg curls)
To add some variety to this workout, Leslie uses double side steps, double knee lifts, and even brings back the fabled 80's Grapevine.
The walkers on this DVD are sure to get you motivated. There are women in their 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's, and even a man in his 70's. People of all ages and all levels of walking can use this DVD. If you're just getting started, only do the first mile.
The thing that I appreciated most about this DVD is that there is no exercise ""extras"" you need to buy to do it. There is no ""stretchie"", no weights, no belt, nothing but your own two feet (and sneakers). Not using extras makes this DVD accessible for everyone.
The music for this DVD is contemporary techno. There is even one song with a little Latin feel to it. The music continues to build in pace until you reach the third mile where you level off for the fourth mile. The pace at the end of the second mile into the beginning of the third mile gets very, very brisk. Hang in there for a great workout.",1055030400,15,1396,4.2518796992481205

1834719,5,B00008DDJD,"I have one of Leslie's older tapes.  Although I like it, this one beats it hands down!  The tape is energizing and upbeat.  I don't even look at the counter on my VCR.  When I finish, I feel refreshed and like I really accomplished something good for myself.  Leslie is trademark-chatty, but much less than in my other video.  Also, I find her chattiness in this video motivating, inspirational and down to earth.  I truly love this video and Leslie!  She is fabulous!",1054598400,4,468,4.554216867469879
1834720,5,B00008DDJD,I have been doing Leslie Sansone's 3-mile Super Fat Burn tapes with weights and the ab belt for almost one year. I was ready for a new challenge! I liked this new DVD and it was  definitely an aerobic challenge! The pace was perfect and it did NOT seem like a Super Challenge. I had my heart monitor on and saw the changes the different moves had on my heart rate. My heart rate stayed in its target zone throughout the movements even the ones I thought were easy. The movements are fun with a few more twists than her other programs! I enjoyed seeing some of her former exercise partners and another man who was 72 years old. Leslie's program can be done by any age groups and only requires perseverance to build up one's endurance. I am a great fan of Leslie Sansone and highly recommend her exercise programs. I figured the DVD format was more durable than the other tapes because I will absolutely put much wear on this DVD! Try this program and you will be hooked! It is easy on your joints and only has about 4 basic steps to learn! Leslie lets you know when you have completed each mile of the 4-mile workout!,1053993600,9,1116,4.314285714285714
1834721,4,B00008DDJD,"This is the 2nd of Leslie's video's for me. I got it because I have her Walk Away the Pounds 3-mile video, and I love that one. This one I don't like as much, because I like the toning aspect of using hand weights. This one doesn't have that, but it's still a very good workout. Besides, nothing stops you from using your handweights anyway if you want to. Leslie is upbeat and positive as usual, and as chatty as usual. But I don't mind, because her personality seems so down-to-earth. I plan to add more of her tapes to my collection.",1053648000,2,536,4.264705882352941
1834722,5,B00008DDJD,I LOVE THE THREE TAPE SET OF WALK AWAY THE POUNDS.  I AM A KINDERGARTEN SHOOL TEACHER AND YOU WOULD THINK I WOULD GET ENOUGH EXECISE JUST DOING THAT.  I AM MENTALLY DRAINED BY THE END OF THE DAY TRYING TO STAY A STEP AHEAD OF THE LITTLE ONES.  WALK AWAY THE POUNDS IS FUN AND EASY....IT TAKES HARDLY ANY THINKING SKILLS TO USE THIS TAPE YET IT GIVES AN EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE WORKOUT. IT IS SO CONVIENIENT I DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE IF I DON'T WANT TO.  I CAN WALK AWAY THE POUNDS IN MY LIVING ROOM AND WALK RIGHT TO THE SHOWER AND RELAX!  I LOVE IT!,1052697600,6,553,3.9909090909090907
1834723,5,B00008DDJD,"It's just that---the workout of workouts!  Of all the Sansone workouts I have tried, this is her best!  I love the fast-paced, energetic music!  The walkers are friendly, normal people and the atmosphere is fun and comfortable---and Leslie is at her best, just as motivating and cheerful as ever!  It IS an intense workout, about 59 minutes, and is much faster paced than her previous workouts.  But, as one reviewer said, you'll never have to count calories again!  I HIGHLY recommend this video!  And, like the other reviewer, am enjoying it so much that I'm ready for Leslie to produce a five mile super challenge!",1051142400,5,617,4.819047619047619
1834724,5,B00008DDJD,"I rely on Leslie Sansone's workouts to keep me consistent with my fitness regime.  This tape is FANTASTIC!  I did it yesterday for the first time, thinking I may not be able to complete all 4 miles.  But the workout was so fun, fast-paced, and energetic that I couldn't stop myself and before I knew it -- I had finished it!
EFFECTIVE workout, cool music, and lots of FUN.  And you feel GREAT after those 4 powerful miles!
I HIGHLY recommend this tape, as well as all other Leslie Sansone tapes!",1050624000,10,495,4.406593406593407

1834743,5,B00008DDJD,"I've been using the Walk Away the Pounds series for many years.  This one is my favorite as it is four consecutive miles.  The other tapes do a mile at a time and you have to combine them to get an extended walk.  I don't care to start each mile over with a warm up, and wanted one that went four or five miles start to finish.  If you're looking for the extended workout, this tape is great.",1461283200,,392,3.9871794871794872

It is one of my absolutes favorites because it is a fast-paced workout that has me sweating 5 minutes in. Pretty much every part of the body gets a workout and I never grow tired of it. I use this DVD as my pre-warm up/work out before heading to my local park to walk with friends for another 8 to 10 miles each day without fail weather permitting.

1834777,5,B00008DDJD,"I seem to always start out my reviews of Leslie Sansone's DVD's the same, by telling a bit about myself.  I'm 45 years old, I'm an advanced walker.  I've been using Leslie Sansone's DVD's for about 5 years now and own about 20 of them.  They've really helped me maintain my weight and stay in shape.  This is one of my favorites.  This is a 4 mile, 1 hour walk.  There are no weights or stretchy bands used, its straight cardio.  I can still work up a pretty good sweat on this one when I work hard at it and, therefore, I love it.  The music is instrumental only but it's a great beat to excercise to and very motivating.  It's starts slow but it gets pretty fast so that you get a great workout.  My only complaint is it slows down about 20 minutes before the end of the workout instead of the usual 10 minutes before so the end drags a little.  This one is all low impact so I think a beginner could do this one if they don't make their movements too exaggerated and save their energy but it's best for an intermediate or advanced walker.  She mainly keeps to the four basic steps of marching, side steps, knee lifts and kicks but she adds some variation.  Like she adds a tap to the double side step and then adds a kick back to the double side step as well.  She also keeps with the same move longer than her other DVD's which I really like since I can start to feel the strain.  She does quite a lengthy session of knee lifts moving up and back and a long sessions of kicks as well.  This is a good workout and a lot of fun.",1441929600,3,1530,4.066889632107023

1834837,1,B00008DDJD,"I am giving this ONE star not because of the content- but because the material on this DVD is IDENTICAL to that which is on another Sansone DVD: the ""Ultimate Collection"".  I was REALLY disappointed when I popped in this disc and there was the SAME  ""4 Mile Super Challenge""....same people, same outfits...SAME.  And that is ALL that is on this DVD...just that single, same 4 mile walk.
Now, as for that 4 mile walk itself- I'd give it a 5 star rating- love it.",1406764800,4,461,4.4
1834838,3,B00008DDJD,I would suggest to anyone that is interested in buying this to review it prior to purchasing if given the chance. It seems to be a good workout and they did work up a sweat however Leslie just wouldn't shut up. My God it was sooooo annoying. The funny thing is that I read this in other reviews and thought that people were being petty but I completely agree with them. I will  buy this DVD however I will definitely play it on mute and watch while I listen to my iPod.,1406332800,,469,4.0978260869565215

1834841,5,B00008DDJD,"I can't say enough good things about this dvd.  It is wonderful for people with limitations or who have not exercised in a while because it starts out very easy.  And with each day, I got stronger and more motivated.  I began to feel better about myself and my health the first week!  After you've built your confidence and a little endurance, you can move up to the longer sessions.  It was actually fun and it shows how long you've walked and how far, too.",1400457600,,458,4.341176470588235
1834842,5,B00008DDJD,"This is a great walk workout equivalent to that of a four-mile walk. What I really like about it is that the instructor tells you when you have completed 1 mile, 2 miles, 3 miles etc.  So if you are tired or don't have the time, you can opt to do just one mile (which goes really fast) or you can break up the exercise and do 1 mile in the morning and two/three miles in the evening.  The instructor and the walkers are quite personable and make you want to keep up with them.

The exercise session is one hour long including warm ups and cool down and comprises of the following moves
1. Brisk walking in place and walking back and forth
2. Knee lifts
3. Kicks
4. Side steps
5. Kick Back",1398038400,,688,4.0814814814814815

1834864,5,B00008DDJD,I started with Leslie's 1 mile walk several years ago. Although my favorite is the 5 mile (with the 2 minute high intensity segments). I mostly use this when I can't get out due to the weather. Also when I need a 15 min pick me up during my work day. It's very easy to adapt this to what you have the time and energy to do on a given day. You can keep it low impact or jog when they walk. I am a fan forever!,1395878400,,408,3.7011494252873565

This dvd is awesome! You can stop whenever you want, anywhere from 1 to 4 miles. It's easy enough that I can listen to my own music while working out, and follow along, yet it's a great workout! I would call it step aerobics, rather than walking. I've done this video 4 times in the last week.  I did 1 mile 3 days, and 2 miles one day... took two days off total so far. This, along with my 1,300 - 1,400 a day calorie limit, has helped me drop 5 lbs. in 6 days. Pretty awesome! It's low impact, which helps me to want to keep doing it over and over.

But I can do up to 1 hr. of any of the Sansone DVDs with no problem to my back or leg at all & get the greatest work out ever. So I highly recommend any one of her tapes if you want to get & stay in shape. The best thing is you can do use them no matter what the weather is like outside.

1834894,4,B00008DDJD,"Love Leslie Sansone's exercise videos (her talking can be a bit like fingernails on the chalkboard...but the exercise itself is worth utilizing the ""picture in picture"" function).  Like the rest of her videos, she pretty much uses the same moves.  However, the 4th mile is that little extra push that can be great when you have extra time.  All in all, the 3 mile walk works best for shortened time periods but this video is worth the purchase.",1387670400,,444,4.666666666666667

1834896,4,B00008DDJD,"I'm a big fan of Leslie Sansone's videos because the workouts are generally doable and quick, but as intense as you want to make them. My go-to video is her Walk It Off In 30 Days because I can alternate Burn 30 one day and Firm 30 (with weights) the next. But sometimes I'm just in the mood for a longer workout. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was because it's not my favorite Leslie Sansone video. But I do like it better than her Five Mega Miles simply because I don't like using the firming band she uses in that one. No equipment required in this one, so it's just the thing for those days when you need to burn a few more calories than a 30-minute workout will burn.",1386633600,,696,4.125

1834898,4,B00008DDJD,"I tried this with a pedometer and found that I only truly walked ""4 miles"" if I just power walked without doing kicks. side steps, etc. I, also, burned more calories just by being creative with the power walking. I found when I did kicks, etc, the 4 mile walk was really only 3.5 miles and I didn't burn as many calories.. I'm sure she takes in account the kicks, side steps, etc when she does her calculations. I just use her ""beats"" to do my own power walk with a little imagination. I do Zumba 3x a week so when I do this DVD, it's all about the steps/calories.

However I have other Sansone videos in my collection that really make me sweat. I will not be using this video again soon. I really think this video is geared for seniors who, due to certain circumstances, need to walk in the comfort of their home.,

Good for beginners to start exercising. Includes some arm exercises during the walk and marching in place, doing side steps, double side steps, side steps with toe tap, grapevine, kick forward and kick backs. Nothing difficult and the marching speeds up quickly after the 1st mile. Video shows Leslie and a variety of walkers (ages 30's-70's) following the steps - video does not have a music only option though which would be nice to just listen to the music while exercising. If you tire of all the talking you can mute the video and still follow along easily with the exercises.  It is a good way to rev up the metabolism without becoming sore all over. No equipment needed - can be done in a small space.

1834991,3,B00008DDJD,"I began working out with this DVD almost ten years ago as a college freshmen and still use it on occassion despite being several years older and pounds lighter.

This DVD features the familiar features common to Leslie Sansone's walking DVDs including: kicks, knee lifts, lateral side steps, walking. I believe the variety of movement is this DVD is what makes it fun and adaptable as your level of fitness improves, for instance now when the team are simply walking I am more keen to run to keep the challenge up. The larger your space to move the more challenging this workout will become. If you're intrested in aerobics but challenged in the pace or cordination department this is a great 'starter' workout and what you do here will transfer to other workouts with practice.

As other reviewers have noted, Sansone is rather chatty and predictable and the dialogue becomes tiresome after a couple of views so I love to play it on silent whilst watching something else. The variety and personalities of the workout staff are cheerful and encouraging even if the generic music leaves a lot to be desired. The aknowledgement of each mile is a great addition but it is difficult to skip ahead or stop the workout without them.

This DVD is quite suitable for those just beginning to workout and/or those who need to modify their routines, and there's no doubt that after an hour of dedication you will feel accomplished.",1356566400,,1420,4.764227642276423

1834993,5,B00008DDJD,"I got this because I have several other DVDs by Leslie. I love her high energy, and this one doesn't disappoint. Fast-paced, but you don't ever actually run or jog in place. One reason I really liked it is because it's 4 continuous miles (no costume or cast changes between the miles).",1354147200,3,285,4.5
1835004,5,B00008DDJD,"I loved the 4 mile! I have Leslie Sansone Walk Slim: Fast and Firm 4 Really Big Miles which I like and her Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk which is my favorite. This 4 mile walk had terrific walking music, Leslie was at her prime in teaching. Some of the movements in this that are not in others are forward side step which is a nice change, forward and back knee-up which you feel, side step tap which is relaxing and you should stretch that tap to get more out of it, and the grapevine at the end is a long, nice stretch because Leslie talks quite a bit. I'm not complaining about her talking though because it's all motivational and encouraging. She tells you about different body parts and what you're working on which is nice. I love the way she mentioned everyone's name and the fact that the ages were all over the board from 20's to 70's. At the 24 minute mark you get to meet 72 year old Elton who is obviously happy to be there and happy to work out. At the 40 minute mark she mentions 55 year old Carole, a feisty little red head who is 60 lbs down! (Congratulations Carole!) At the 45 minute mark you meet Linda who is a walk leader and has been helping Leslie lead classes for 23 years. There are so many other gals I recognize from her other videos and love seeing them all in this video - many of them are obviously walk leaders as well. The walk is fast and fun. Each mile mark is shown across the bottom of the screen and averages about 15 minutes. You don't have to fret if you get out of step, just keep stepping, you can change when it's convenient. If the camera zooms in on someone who is out of sync - look away and keep marching. As long as you're moving you'll get a good workout out of this dvd.

Love it, I've seen quick results as well and have recommended this to all of my friends.  Thank you, Leslie is fantastic and keeps it fun....I like that she has all ages represented, I plan to NEVER stop moving, that's when you turn to jelly, not happening, ""50-something and Size 4 Forever""....yay!",1346889600,,677,4.28125

However, I will say that Leslie Sansone is very encouraging and authentic in this dvd. If you are just looking to get a little more healthy and mobile, or just starting to get into working out, this is a great introduction to getting moving. However, if you are hoping to see home drastic changes in your body, from MY personal experience, this is not necessarily the way to go.",1338163200,,583,4.252252252252252

Her workouts are great for beginners and are not to hard on any part of your body. When I first started I did not find myself waking up in the morning with sore muscles or being in pain. I can say I have done the 1,2,3 and 4 mile workouts and I love them all. I do recommend working your way up start at 1 do that for a few weeks then move on, now I use the 1 and 2 mile walks when I need a quick workout on a busy day.

However, I was disappointed with this purchase since I thought it was a different express walk than one I already own (I have this one: http://www.amazon.com/Leslie-Sansone-Pounds-Express-Challenge/dp/B00008DDJD/ref=pd_cp_mov_0 with the green cover).

1835013,5,B00008DDJD,"This is my third exercise DVD from Leslie. My first two (the 1 and 2 mile walk diet and the 3 mile super fat burning WATP) especially the 3 mile one was very intense. Now I have worked my way up to the 4 mile and I love it!! One of the best things I like about this video is that it did not require any equipment like the 3 mile did, just all the way straight cardio. Another thing that is super about this video is that Leslie have different ""twists"" for some of the exercises, for example the side walk has 3 other twists in addition to the double side walk: the toe tap, the kick back, and the  grapevine ( which I still have not done yet!).
I started to get interested in Leslie Sansone exercise videos last June or July, when a lady acquaintance at an organization I belong to informed about the 1 and 2 mile walk diet ( which my son purchased for me on another website). I liked that video so much and it also helped in losing weight that I bought the 3, 4, and 5 mile from Amazon.
I just had gastric bypass surgery last March on St Paddys Day ( I will be celebrating my one year anniversary soon), and the doctors stress having an exercise regiment every day or at least 3 times a week for at least 30 minutes at a time. At first after surgery at home I was just walking around the corridor around the apartment complex wher I live, and that was getting boring, and I am so glad this lady suggested that video to me, because I have been on a role since then!!
I fell in love with this video and the others because Leslies approach (god bless this women!!) is so simple and she motivates her audience throughout the whole exercise. I have read a few of the other comments that mention Leslie is very chatty. She is chatty, but if people really pay attention, most of her chattiness (around 90%) is encourging and motivating the audience, which I love. The other 10% is just talking with the walkers, which just helps take up time.
So far, as of this date I have lost around 120 lbs approx since my surgery last March and I have used Leslie's exercise DVDs including the 4 mile ( for 3 weeks) since last June or July, so they have made a Hugh contribution to my weight loss. My current exercise schedule is up to 6 times a week with the 4 mile 3 times during the week (usually Monday, Wednesday and Friday), the 3 mile 2 times during the week (usually Tuesday and Thursday), and the 2 mile during the weekend( usually Saturday).
I have never in my life looked forward to doing any type of exercise, not this couch potato!! But since I have introduced to Leslies videos and is now on the 4 mile (super challenge) I can't wait to get to the 5 mile one and I will continue to purchase more exercise DVDs from this incredible lady who motivates people like me to get up off our buns and do a good workout with her simplified but challenging approach. Now that I am an experienced witness I can say, ""Leslie, you are my Exercise Guru. God bless you!!""",1331251200,6,2951,4.204585537918871

1835020,5,B00008DDJD,"This was the first 4 mile dvd I purchased once I felt I was ready to graduate from the 3 mile workout. At first I wasn't too sure about the workout. Mainly, it didn't seem as intense as the 3 mile at times. But once I tried it a few times, I realized that I truly was getting a good workout and the pounds started dropping off again (I had hit a plateau with 3 miles). I then ended up going to another 4 mile workout with the firm band and boosted walking. But I highly recommend this dvd as as a bridge between 3 miles and the more intense 4 mile workouts.

The music was not great, but it was okay. And the walkers were some old favorites from other dvds. It was also a boost to see Mary from the 3 mile dvd looking much thinner. Love how cheerful Leslie is during the dvds although it drives other people nuts at times. I've read some reviews that said Leslie misses cues or gets off time, but I don't see that. All in all, I think she does great and I'm enjoying working out with her.",1323302400,3,988,4.0152284263959395

1835022,5,B00008DDJD,This walking DVD is the best I have tried.  It keeps you motivated and allows for modifications.  The only way to experience the wonderful change is to get started  I had to work up to the 4 miles but that is expected and honored by Leslie  This is the only walking DVD that has held my interest and is definately satisfying  I lost 30 lbs in about 4-months  walking a minimum of three times a week  thank you leslie!!!!!!,1317168000,8,422,4.265822784810126

1835024,5,B00008DDJD,"I've done a few of the WATP dvds, but this one stands out way above the others.  I started out sweating like a pig during the 1 mile and, after much dedication and time, I am now doing this dvd 6 days a week.  This is what Leslie does for you!  I went from sucking in air and barely making it through the program to still sucking in air, but being able to push myself and get through this program with MUCH less struggle.

If you're willing to commit to doing these dvds often, Leslie will do the rest.  Yes, she talks a lot, but she's incredibly encouraging and makes you want to keep going.  If you're on the market for a mid-advanced cardio workout, I can tell you that you would be surprised how much this pushes you.

ONE MORE THING: yes, there is one point when she says, ""when I kick, I kick a cat.""  And then she laughs a laugh like, 'oh crap, I just said something inappropriate.'  Honestly, though, I don't think she is advocating violence toward animals in any way, shape, or form.  She was clearly kidding.  So, to the people who threw a fit over that one little thing, get over it.  Life is too short.  There are MANY more important things in the world to be passionate about.  If you're an animal lover and want to help them, donate your time to an animal shelter.  Don't spend your time whining behind a computer.  I can promise you that you have ZERO impact doing that.  Just a thought.

Anyway, the video is awesome.  Go buy it!",1307750400,4,1445,4.2463235294117645

I am 6 months pregnant and I am feeling pretty darn good. I hope to continue with this dvd for the next three months!

I alternate this dvd with another one of Leslie workouts. I try to fit in a mile in the morning. I find the more I exercise the better I am feeling!

I had to find something low impact, but yet fast enough to help with my circulation. Swimming seemd like a good option, but then again it's a big pain to haul myself there. Here with the dvd's I have the convenience to exercising when I want and even how long. She gives the option of 1 mile, 2mile...ect.

I have no problem finishing this workout (its an hour), though the five mile walk I have, I cant seem to get through all five miles. I think because its at a slower pace, so you notice that it takes longer. The moves can be a little repetitious but its fun and you actually break a sweat and get your heart rate up.

1835053,1,B00008DDJD,"We were reviewing this dvd, prior to actually doing the routine. It was rather ordinary, with music that was annoying and the usual routine aerobics, mixed with intervals of walking. What wasn't expected was the comment made by Sansone about doing kicks. She said she thought of kicking a cat,everytime she did a kick and laughed. I have never heard anything like this on any exercise tape, it was shocking and disturbing.

Will not be buying any of these tapes, based on what this instructor said. Promoting animal cruelty on a exercise dvd, what next???",1281139200,9,555,4.842105263157895
1835054,4,B00008DDJD,"While not as vigorous as Leslie's ""Walk Slim Fast & Firm 4 Really Big Miles"", this tape does a really good job of waking your body up to an exercise week. In fact I totally understand why Diane Vitale, the leader of the St Theresa Catholic Church (in Sunny Hills, Florida) exercise group, uses it first thing Monday mornings.

Unlike a previous reviewer, I do not find the tape ""extremely boring"" but then I like to dance. Additionally, like a number of other aerobic tapes on the market, you get out of it what you put into it. Leslie herself keeps telling her audience to ""keep exagerating your movements"" and to ""challenge yourself"". That might mean bending your knees more as you side step to the music. I particularly liked pacing myself to the energetic woman to the right of Leslie on the screen, 55-year-old Carol, who Leslie reported had lost 60 lbs since starting to exercise to the Walk Away the Pounds series.

As Leslie Sansone herself states: ""Of all the healthy choices you can make in your life, the one that bring you the most rewards is a brisk, brisk walking program.  You're doing it now.""  She cheerfully adds that she hopes her group helps to motivate the exerciser doing the movements. Indeed it does. Thanks, Leslie.",1279497600,2,1240,4.648401826484018

It goes for about 55 minutes and uses no bands or weights-all you need to bring is yourself.  I love the fast pace she uses for part of the workout and I love the easy to follow variety of moves she uses, too.

1835057,4,B00008DDJD,"This is a nice addition to the Walk Away the Pounds series by Leslie Sansone. In-home walking can be a good way to get in low-impact exercise whether you're beginning a new exercise program or need to break-up and compliment other routines that you do. But it's easy to become bored ""just walking"" without an engaging instructor to keep you motivated, some mixing up of the moves, and providing a bit of a challenge to the more experienced walker. This workout comes through on all of the above points.

The full four mile walk takes a little under an hour to complete, and you WILL feel as if you've gotten a good -- but perhaps not overly strenuous -- workout from it. No addiional equipment is required for this program, which is also a bonus, although I try to use light handweights when I do it to give my upper-body more of a challenge. If you're familiar with Leslie Sansone's other walking programs, you'll be familiar with the moves here. It's all her basic stuff: primarily kickbacks, sidesteps, kneelifts with some doubles and a little grapevine thrown in at the end. The kneelifts definitely will make your legs burn after four miles!

I also enjoyed that this video was not just Leslie walking alone, but with a full studio of other walkers. It's motivating to see people of all age groups (20 to 70+ in this case!) and of all different shapes and sizes doing the program. The musical score is decent enough, setting the pace to gradually increase through the first two miles and then slowly decrease at the end.

If you're used to doing long, very aerobically intense workouts, you may not feel like you're getting a lot of ""burn"" out of this program. However, there are ways to up the intensity, either by using light handweights as I do, or taking some moves to higher-impact versions (like doing skips or skaters instead of sidesteps). But it's also nice sometimes to take it down a notch and simply feel refreshed from taking a long, quick-paced walk. So overall, I give this program a strong positive rating, a good step up (sorry, no pun intended!) from Leslie's 2 and 3 mile routines.",1262476800,,2105,4.638069705093834

What more could a girl possibly ask for? Now this was way back in 2006. After using the dvd for about a month or so, I became a little careless with it and I think my then 1 year old probably scratched it and that was the end of my leslie sansone dvd :-( Now 3 years later, I have ordered for the dvd again, along with 3 other leslie sansone dvds, and I just got them in the mail yesterday...I am super excited and I plan to give you an update in a few weeks or months when I see results....and as it so happens I am the greatest female couch potato you ever met ;-)) All in all, I would absolutely recommend this dvd.",1260144000,,844,3.8563218390804597

1835060,5,B00008DDJD,"As a huge fan of Leslie Sansone's walking workouts, I must say that this is one of my most favorite walking workouts in her series.  When I initially bought the DVD, I thought that I would never have time to do a 4-mile workout.  However, on a whim, I decided to try it out one Saturday morning and was amazed at how quickly the time flew by!

The music was energetic, Leslie and her buddies were very peppy, and the combinations were great!  Yes, Leslie does stick with the same routine as her other workouts, but she does ""mix it up"" by doing double kick-backs, double side steps with a kick-back, and some other new moves.  There are no weights or stretchie bands used, but this workout gets the heart racing, oxygen flowing, and body parts moving around.  By the end of this workout, you will definitely feel like you did something great for your body.

Sometimes her workouts tend to drag on some of her DVDs, but this one flies by.  At the moment, this is my favorite workout DVD on my aerobics days.  I just wish all of her workouts were this fast-paced and upbeat.  :)  I never thought I would say this about a 4-mile walk, as I usually only have time for 2- and 3-mile walks in the morning.

I was not sure what to expect, being that it's close to an hour, I thought it might drag and be a tad boring.  Not the case at all, the time went by quickly and I really enjoyed the workout.

Leslie is joined by quite a large group here, mostly ladies but one man is also in the class, who is 70 and quite energetic.  They are all dressed in black attire, and seem to be really enjoying themselves.

There are no balls, stretchie bands or anything else used, just the basic steps, plus a few new moves that add a little variety.  The first mile is slower, miles 2 & 3 are brisker, and then you slow down again for mile 4.  A part of me had trouble slowing down, I wanted to keep going!  I would have preferred slowing down at the 3.5 mile mark rather than the 3 mile mark but that's just a minor quibble.  Certainly not a dealbreaker.

Overall, I was very pleased with this workout, the music is lively and keeps you going.  Very enjoyable, I am glad that I picked this one up.  4 and a half stars.",1258761600,2,1107,4.097674418604651

Having said that, this is a great workout dvd!  All of the walkers seem sincerely happy and Leslie and the music motivate me to complete the 4-mile walk (takes about 55 minutes) each time.  Of course, you can only do 1, 2, or 3 miles, but since day 1, I've always been motivated to walk 4 miles.  I am not sure how many calories we burn with this workout but I try to exaggerate the moves to burn a few additional calories.  I recommend this dvd for a total body workout.  I also use Kickboxing for Dummies.  Again, I rarely exercise but the goal is to alternate between this dvd and the kickboxing dvd.",1240963200,2,761,4.1506849315068495

It has a great pace and the 4 miles go by fast, everyone in the video is energetic and the music is great.  I walk 5 days a week and usually 4 out of the 5 days I use this video.  I love it and highly recommend it and know you'll love it too.",1240790400,3,317,3.5652173913043477

I'm biased perhaps as I love all her DVD's though with some of her groups she tends to be chatty.  If you prefer exercising with Leslie alone, this one isn't for you.

It is tough when you go away or just want a change of pace.
These videos can be as strong as you want them; and not only cover walking, it could be running, balance, strength incorporated as you get better and better.
Plus, you just need a few square feet in front of your tv.

I have lost so much weight from it, I am able to use my old clothes for blankets and curtains now!!! Feels so good to SWEAT, SWEAT, SWEAT.",1238976000,4,444,4.056818181818182
1835071,5,B00008DDJD,"What a fantastic workout! I did it for the first time all the way through yesterday. I felt so good afterward!

WATP Express: 4 Mile Super Challenge is one of three 4-mile workouts that Leslie Sansone offers. What makes this differ from the others is that there are no intervals of her ""boosted walking"" (a light jog). There's also no use of her ""boosters"" (i.e. stretchie, walk belt, hand weights). I would recommend this program for anyone who has been using Leslie's programs and want to see if they can do something a little bit longer without getting exhausted. It's also perfect if you just want a total low-impact cardio workout that lasts an hour.

It's definitely intermediate, but beginners should not be intimidated. One of the wonderful things about Leslie is that she always says you can't do her workouts wrong. Just try a mile if you're concerned, and you can work your way up. How great you'll feel when you can do it all the way through! There are markers that show up on the screen when you've completed a mile, which is a great reinforcement. Also, late into the workout Leslie promises it never gets faster than you're doing at that moment. That really pushed me to finish it. I was actually very tired when i did it. This workout is just the great quality you'd expect from Leslie Sansone. Great music, good cuing, excited cast members, and lots of inspiration.

I have several of Leslie's DVDs now, because she's one of the most encouraging, non-intimidating, friendly instructors out there. I should also mention that I am the proud survivor of two-open heart surgeries. So, I'm no athlete! You CAN do this, and you WILL see results if you stick to it.",1237075200,4,1675,4.671186440677966

She often states that her workouts are not for sissies and that is very true but REALLY anyone can do them. You just set your own pace. I started working out with Leslie's videos on April 1st, 2008. I weighed 240 lbs. It is now February 24th, 2009 and I am happy...no thrilled to tell you that I have walked away 83 lbs!!! I went from 2X to size 12. My goal is to lose 100 lbs and I know I will get there. When I started out I could barely get to the end of the 3 mile video. I'm up to 5 miles now and I love it! I'm hooked! What a great thing to be addicted to...excerize!!! Now here's the best part....I'm 62..I'll be 63 in just a few days and the young girls who work out with me can't keep up!!!

All of my favorite walkers are there, along with some new ones & they all look happy & fit.  I'm particularly impressed with the 72-year-old man, who is so robust for his age, & Carole, who at 55 years looks so fit.

If you are looking for something ""more"" here it is.  However I did not like the fact that she didn't use weights in this video and the setting was very impersonal and intimidating.  The set was a steel gray and all the people were in very good shape which made it seem like this video wasn't for everyone.",1223769600,,463,4.287356321839081

The four miles do go by quickly and the steps are fast-paced, but easy to follow.  I like the fact that this is all aerobics - no weights, stretchies, etc.  It's great that all the walkers are wearing the same outfit - somehow it makes it less distracting.  I thought the music was good - each segment matches up perfectly with it.  Thanks to Leslie, I am now down 45 pounds - half way to my goal.  I work out to her many DVDs just about daily.  Thanks, Leslie!!!",1221868800,,619,4.1
1835081,5,B00008DDJD,"I'm not a hard-core aerobicizer by far, so this work out works perfectly for people like me.  It's straightforward and easy to do, and Leslie is really great at motivating.  If you've grown tired of the patter, you can always do what I do - catch-up with friends, family and errands on the phone while you do the work-out.  It's THAT easy.  You can do two things at the same time but still get a highly effective work-out.

Don't expect a flashy or snazzy video.  This is just a bunch of gals and a dude in a glorified studio, but hey, that's all you really need.  What's great about this video is that you can make it part of your week.  Unlike so many other videos that are just too tiring and intimidating that you quit in a couple of months, I've been a Walk Away the Pounds fan for a good 4 years now.  I do it 2-3 times a week and found my health to have massively improved.  I've tried other videos in that time but always find myself popping Leslie back into the DVD player.

Another great thing is how she always reminds you that you don't need to do the full range.  You can slow down a bit or do a half-range so it truly does become an individualized work-out.

Easy to do but effective, better health and losing weight.  Good deal!  Can't wait to try the 5 Mile, Leslie!  Thanks a bunch!

PS  Leslie, if you're reading this, please consider adding SUBTITLES to your videos!  Makes it easier for us multi-taskers (on the phone talking while working out) to keep up.  And of course, the hearing-impaired!  Thanks!",1219536000,4,1523,4.329787234042553

You can feel the energy from beginning to end...most importantly the effects of the workout afterward.  FEELS SO GOOD TO SWEAT, SWEAT, SWEAT!!",1217116800,,400,4.591549295774648

All of the usual steps are in there plus some grapevines and other movements which are a bit different than usual.  After I finish this workout I feel great and feel like I have gotten a good workout.  (And no....she doesn't say she likes to kick cats....she says that Cat, who is one of the walkers, loves to do kicks!)",1216512000,2,471,4.5058823529411764

I didn't really think I could get a good workout but after a few sessions, I'm convinced this is a great alternative to walking outside.

Leslie Sansone is very likeable, the workout is very doable for all kinds of ages, and it is something you can stick to, unless some other workout videos that make you jump, kick, dance with very difficult moves that get you frustrated.

This DVD in particular presents a great challenge, that not only involves light walking, it also offers some nice aerobic segments that make you sweat, but not to the point of hating it. It's very very doable, as I said above.

I don't really need to buy a treadmill now. Insead, I put a Sansone DVD, turn on my favorite music, and walk 1, 2, 3, or more miles without getting out.

If you are familiar with Leslie Sansone, then you know her workouts are made to be easy, even for the ""coordination challenged group"" like myself.  This video uses her regular walk, sidestep, knee lift, kick and kick-back, but in the second half of the walk also introduces some variations that make the walk interesting(the grapevine, and double kick-backs, ect...) and you really don't feel like you've walked an hour when it's done. Don't get me wrong, you'll be sweating, but unlike the dull repetitive treadmill or other exercise, you are constantly changing things up, and it passes the time quickly.

This  and the 3 mile are my primary workouts now, and to date I have lost 26lbs with the combination of these workouts.  I love Leslies positive attitude and the music is peppy and fun.",1213833600,5,950,4.526315789473684

It is not customizable--I would find it much more user-friendly if it was. It would be such a simple thing to make it better in this way. Also, the steps are somewhat repetitive throughout.

1835104,5,B00008DDJD,"I have several of Leslie's tapes and this is one of my favorites.  I often don't have time for this workout during the week so I tend to save it for weekends (it also allows my husband to join me since he like these workouts too).  I really enjoy the longer walks, they get my heart pumping and I can work up a good sweat but the best thing about them is how I feel afterward. Unlike some tapes I do Leslie's workouts never leave me exhausted. These workouts have very easy steps to follow so your mind doesn't have to work very hard BUT they require enough of your attention that you are focused on the steps and your body while the rest of the world goes away.  For this one hour whatever else is on your mind gets pushed to the back and you will feel tension just melting from your body as you walk.  By the time the tape is over my mind and body are totally relaxed yet energized at the same time.

I highly recommend this video, I purchased mine as part of a set with 3 & 4 mile workouts.  There is also a set with one, two and three mile walks for those who wish to start off with a shorter walk.  They are not complicated or hard but you will get a good cardio workout and she will work most of the muscles in your body. It's great to do after a strength training workout, especially if you are a little sore.  I find it loosens all of my tight muscle and I feel much better afterwards.

As for all of the people who complain about the chatter, I find her more annoying than some instructors, much less annoying than others.  At least all her chatter seems genuine, you feel like if you took a class in  person that is just how she'd be.  Overall a really good investment for your health or weight loss goals.",1193616000,6,1716,4.104790419161676
1835105,3,B00008DDJD,"I absolutely loved this DVD when I got it--that is, I loved it right up until I developed major knee problems...

Leslie Sansone's workouts typically feature a lot of sidesteps, many of which are done while bending the knees (ie, squatting ""like a shortstop"", as she says).  I never, EVER had knee/leg problems and didn't suffer any accidents or specific injuries...rather, my problems flared up directly after doing this particular DVD over the course of a few days.  Now, I've been dealing with problems for the last 1-1/2 years and had to undergo physical therapy to try and undo the damage.  In fact, following my injuries, I've had two physical therapists and an orthopedic surgeon all tell me that the squatting sidesteps are extremely hard on the knees and are a bad idea overall.

For those who are interested in weight loss, I found that this DVD was not helpful to me in that arena either.  I had initially started doing this and some other Sansone DVDs for the express purpose of trying to lose a little bit of weight.  After a year of using her various DVDs with zero results, I finally gave up on them.  Instead, I started doing interval training on my own and finally lost weight after only two months.  In fact, with the interval training, I find I am much more toned than I ever was while doing Sansone's workouts.

Anyway, for people who are still interested in this DVD, I can say that I loved the music and appreciated the fact that this session did not require weights, belts, or any other special equipment.  I also really enjoyed the upbeat nature of the workout, with the minor exception of Sansone's ""verbal diarrhea"".  However, following the damage to my knees, I did end up selling my copy of this particular DVD.  I ultimately decided that avoiding Leslie Sansone workouts was necessary in order to spare my knees from further injury.  This particular DVD is much more intense and strenuous than many of her previous workouts (at least of the ones I've tried) and, in my case, it did more harm than good.",1191283200,2,2031,4.652661064425771
1835106,5,B00008DDJD,"I would call this a gently vigorous low impact aerobics workout.  I have several dozen workout tapes, collected over the years, and this is the one I keep coming back to.  It has a good warm-up and cool-down and between them, about one hour of walking in place, kicks, side-steps, etc. Leslie's talking during the workout annoyed me a little at first, but has  grown on me and I now actually enjoy her motivational efforts and find the tape easy to get through without watching the clock.  What I like best though, is the emphasis on strengthening ""the core"".  I've found that by doing this workout 1-2X weekly and then mixing some of my other workouts the rest of the week, that core area really is stronger and my posture has improved.  I feel better walking and it's become easier to do my other workout videos/DVD's.
I do highly recommend this workout unless you're looking for high impact activity.  If someone is just starting to work out, this is good, but may take a few times to get all the way through without flagging.",1190419200,,1029,4.559782608695652

I get a little tired of the constant chatter, but I do love Leslie's philosophy ""do quality things every day."" Working up a good sweat is a great thing to do, and this DVD gets you going. Also, this is an excellent DVD for women going through menopause.",1188950400,2,546,4.259615384615385
1835110,4,B00008DDJD,This is a great Walk Away the Pounds Workout if you feel like you are just past the 3 miler.  Leslie does tend to chat too much and her corny jokes are really annoying after the 10th time.  After completing the workout a few times I now pop the DVD into my laptop and walk while watching TV.,1187827200,2,291,4.0
1835111,5,B00008DDJD,"This is a great workout, I got my first Leslie tape 10 years ago which was the 2 miles walk.  I just got this and I can't believe what an enjoyable workout it is.
At first I could not do the whole 4 miles and I found the routine to be difficult and long.  It took me about a week or 10 days to do the whole 4 miles from start to finish.  Once I built tolerance and did the 4 miles I could not believe how fast the time would go and I love the routine too. So don't be disgorged at the beginning it will take time.",1185926400,5,513,3.688073394495413
1835112,5,B00008DDJD,"This workout is so fun and feels great! Leslie is uplifting and motivating as usual. I'm one who enjoys her chatter and optimistic outlook on health and life in general! She's awesome. This dvd is fantastic! My favorite WATP workout to date. Oh, unlike one reviewer noted, Leslie does not say anything about ""kicking a cat!"" She mentions her fellow walker whose name is ""Kat,"" and how much ""Kat"" loves the kicking parts of the workout and how everytime ""I kick, I think of Kat,"" and the camera then pans to ""Kat"". Come on, this is Leslie were talking about, she's not the type that would hurt an innocent animal.",1185494400,7,612,4.572727272727272

1835114,5,B00008DDJD,Thank you Leslie. I do this dvd 2 times a day. Once in the morning and than once in the late afternoon. Looking forward to the results. Never have a problem with the steps of in home walking and the pace is great. You know that all of your muscles are at work for a good 56 minutes and it feels terrrriiifffic. Thank you again.

1835115,5,B00008DDJD,"I'm not out of shape by any means, but I've never engaged in deliberate, regular cardiovascular activity. For the last few weeks I've been trying to get into a cardio routine that I could actually stick with, to no avail. I prefer to work out at night, but don't have access to a gym, and am loathe to go running in the dark. So I tried out a few cardio DVD's, including this one. This is the one I'll be sticking with. It's certainly not perfect; there are several non-exercise related issues I have with this DVD, but they could all be positives for someone else, so I'll list the pros and cons and let you decide.

PROS
1. This is just a good workout. It's brisk, fun and at the end, I'm always sweating hard.
2. There is no extra equipment necessary. This was a big plus for me: no weights, no stretchies, no steps, nothing. Just some space and a pair of walking shoes.
3. The steps involved are few and easy to learn.
- Knee lifts: lifting alternate knees to about waist level.
- Kicks: a controlled kick to the front.
- Side-steps: stepping out wide to alternating sides.
- Kick-backs: lifting the leg backwards.
And of course, walking in place. Leslie also incorporates some very simple arm moves.
4. This workout is almost an hour long, but it goes by very very quickly, due in part to the fact that Leslie almost never stops talking, so you're not thinking about the time. I'm always surprised how much time has gone by when I'm done.
5. Leslie has a good sense of how the watcher is going to feel, physically, at each part of the exercise. The more intense moves, like kickbacks, only come up a few times, with long intervals between them. And the hardest parts only last about a minute, so you feel tired without being competely exhausted and discouraged. At no point did I feel like I couldn't finish.
6. Finally, Leslie gives frequent reminders about form and posture that make it very difficult to forget to stand up straight and stabilize your abs. Every few minutes she reminds you to check your posture.

CONS
1. Coming off that last pro, eventually, when you've done the workout a few times and know what to do, Leslie's advice came seem a little annoying. But this isn't really a big deal since it's necessary and helps the workout move faster.
2. The music, which is mostly techno, doesn't transition well. It stops and there are a few moments of silence before the next song starts. Every time this happens, you can see that the background walkers lose their rhythm and kind of falter, then struggle to match the new beat.
3. Not being a Christian, I found myself distracted by Leslie's occasional religious comment, like ""throw your arms to heaven,"" and ""say Hallelujah!"" She also make several mentions of how the workout is good for the soul, which I found both cheesy and unnecessary. I'm doing this for aerobic benefits, not a spiritual lift. But some of you might appreciate this, so decide for yourself.
4. I have to tell you, Leslie's sense of humor leaves something to be desired. She loves to make silly little jokes that I usually found lame. But she's sincere and sometimes I chuckled a little, so we'll let it slide.
5. Over and over again, Leslie mentions the ages of the walkers, pointing out that several of them are grandmothers, over 70, etc. A few of them looked a little uncomfortable to have her pointing this out, and I swear one of the women grimaced when her age was mentioned. As an 18-year-old, I couldn't really relate to this age-dropping and wondered for a few minutes if I'd picked up a workout for the elderly.
6. Leslie repeats the same words of encouragement over and over and over. ""We're doing this for all the benefits!"" That's her favorite and it drove me nuts.

So none of my complaints are with the workout itself, just about the presentation. The music is just okay, as is the set. One girl, named Wendy apparently, on the far right of the group, has simply AMAZING abs that made me really push myself hard. I want Wendy's six-pack! Sounds lame, but it keeps me motivated.

I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a good cardio/walking routine. I cannot imagine that you could do this regularly and not see the results you want.",1182470400,14,4203,4.533596837944664
1835116,5,B00008DDJD,This is a great exercise video.  Not like others I have purchased.  It is very easy and gives you an awesome workout.  I've since ordered the 5 mile video by Leslie Sansone!  Can't wait to get it!,1182211200,3,196,4.216216216216216
1835117,5,B00008DDJD,I love this workout - I do it 4 times a week and I am getting great results.  Highly recommend it for a sold indoor walking program.,1180396800,2,132,3.888888888888889
1835118,4,B00008DDJD,"I can't do aerobic tapes to save my life, I can never follow the steps at every exercise class I've tried, and just walking feels so unproductive. Leslie Sansone's WATP 1-2-3 mile tapes clicked with me, so I had to get  the 4 mile Super Challenge. It's the aerobic workout I've always wanted and it's a workout I can actually do. The walkers are energetic and can keep up, which means there's no modification, although Leslie does show some herself. Their enthusiasm is contagious. The music isn't that bad, especially if you're just following the beat. I like that there is no toning to slow down the pace. There are days when I dread the almost one hour workout, but once you get into it, it really does go by quickly. Her stretching is too short, but you can do more on your own.

Of course, Leslie still does chatter a lot and is out of rhythm sometimes, so I make it a point to watch one of the women in the background. Occasionally, she'll be so busy talking, she'll lose count and will just abruptly stop a move and tell everyone to go back to walking. I've done the workout enough times to know when to tune her out. I can't figure out why the music just stops and starts instead of transitioning, but as long as you keep walking and adjust when it starts up again, you'll be okay.

All in all, it is a good workout and she really does seem like she cares about health and fitness. I just pre-ordered her 4 Fast Miles DVD, hoping it's the same type of workout in quicker time.",1180396800,9,1484,4.311827956989247
1835129,5,B00008DDJD,"If complicated aerobic moves leave you feeling frustrated but you still want a good workout, try this video!  You can do 1, 2 3, or 4 mile walks and they will get your heartrate pumping.  I am pretty fit and was doubtful if this could give me a good workout but it certainly does.  At one hour for the full 4 mile walk this is great endurance training.  Buy this DVD and you won't be disappointed.",1179446400,8,397,4.184210526315789

1835132,4,B00008DDJD,"for people who are ""on the go"" or very busy, I think this workout takes too long, but I guess that's what you get when you walk 4 miles!  It is a one hour video.  It's still better than driving to the gym, working out, remembering your gym clothes, etc....You'll definetly get a terrific workout with this one.",1177977600,,310,4.327586206896552
1835133,5,B00008DDJD,"I have several of Leslie Sansone's walking videos and this one is one of my favorites! It is challengeing, but not exhausting. I feel great afterwards! I enjoy the group of walkers she has with her and the music keeps you at a good pace. You don't need any stretchie bands or anything at all like in a few of her others........although, you can easily omit them even in those and get a great workout. That is what I love about her workouts--so easy to taylor to your own level and needs.

I highly recommend this, and her other workouts.",1175644800,8,537,4.37

1835137,5,B00008DDJD,I'm in my 50s. I have many workout DVDs and this is definitely one of the best I've owned. It's low impact and easy on the joints. The pace is neither too fast nor too slow. This is a great workout for older women/men who enjoy easier aerobic workout with simple basic moves but still work up a lot of sweat at the end. You can intensify the moves if you feel up to it. I even modified some of the moves to make them a little harder. Lesile Sansone is a good intructor although she is a little too chatty. I wish she would give me a break sometime! This is a very good workout DVD and I would highly recommend it.,1174348800,7,613,3.991869918699187

I fell in love with Leslie's dvds and continued to use them after the pregnancy was over to lose weight. They really work! After losing 50 lbs and coming to a standstill, I needed to rev it up and break the plateau I'd reached...well, this dvd did it!! I'm not losing as many pounds now, but the inches on my waistline and hips are melting away! My 18 month old twins even enjoy trying to walk with me!!! (they think it is funny to see mommy walking in one spot) So not only is this a great workout, but you can even work out when the kiddies won't take a nap with this one...that's pretty hard to beat! Keep bringing it Leslie!",1174003200,7,783,4.261744966442953

It's a lot of fun to do, and as always Leslie keeps you motivated and lets you know if you're just starting out that you do not have to do all the moves just keep the pace.  She has some great variations in this DVD.  I have some of her other DVD's and I like them too, but this one is my favorite.  It's a great winter work out when the weather keeps you from waling outside.",1172188800,5,438,3.8222222222222224

Each mile walked is celebrated and you feel a sense of accomplishment. I would especially reccommend this dvd to previously sedentary persons who are in good health. It will definitely get you moving and looking forward to your next workout. I am now an avid exercising fan! Some reviewers hated the music, but I believe this is a reflection of personal tastes. It was my experience that the music encouraged me and was appropriate to the exercise routines. I have bought a Leslie Sansone dvd before, but this is the one that transformed my exercise history and  changed my life.",1170892800,7,716,4.682539682539683

1835147,5,B00008DDJD,"I love this DVD!  The only time I can exercise is early in the morning before work.  Walking alone outside in the dark is not the greatest idea, so this in-home walking program is a life-saver!  It is not difficult, but at the same time, all the muscle groups get a really great workout.  Anyone can follow along!  I sit at a desk all day and my joints get tired and achy.  Doing this upbeat cardio program indoors 3 days a week, and walking outdoors on the weekend really helps keep me in shape.  I love Leslie's positive attitude, which motivates me to keep going even when I'm tired!  Great addition to anyone's exercise DVD library!",1169596800,5,636,4.422413793103448
1835148,5,B00008DDJD,"The previous poster (E. Snyder) misinterpreted what Leslie said in reference to kicking. Leslie does not say ""every time I kick, I pretend to kick a cat"". She says ""every time I kick, I think of 'Kat'"". Kat is the young lady in the back that enjoys the kicking part of the walk program, she is actually one of my favorite walkers. Too bad you misintrepreted that comment and have missed out on some wonderful health benefits walking with Leslie.",1168992000,9,445,4.575
1835149,5,B00008DDJD,"I like to play this DVD while I walk on the treadmill.  I can't do all the extra moves that Leslie does, but it keeps me walking at a nice fast pace.  My daughter does it without the teadmill and enjoys it also.  I also have Leslie's Walk and Jog DVD and do that on the treadmill too.  I would highly recommend this DVD!",1167955200,5,320,3.953125
1835150,4,B00008DDJD,"If you're a fan of the other Leslie Sansone DVDs, then you will definitely enjoy this one too. It's a really great work-out and you can feel all your muscles getting fired up as you go. Walking 4 miles in just less than an hour feels like a wonderful achievement. And the great part is that the studio paticipants have also worked up a sweat! Leslie's chatter can get quite distracting, but it's still an excellent way to boost your metabolism and have some fun at the same time.",1167177600,4,479,4.393258426966292

1835152,5,B00008DDJD,"This is my fourth workout with Leslie. I did the one-mile, two-mile, and three-mile already and wanted to move up in intensity and endurance. This dvd is great! The workout lasts for about an hour and really challenges you just like her other dvds. This time around there are no weights or anything, just good ol' fashioned exercise. As a reformed couch potato who just turned 30, I am very happy that I've discovered these workouts.

As compared to the other earlier workouts, this one for some reason seems to have more energy. Though I miss the women (and Randy!) from the other dvds, you will see that the intensity is much stronger with this set of workout folk. This time you will actually see them sweat!

My only complaint about this workout is that the music in the beginning is absolutely mind-bogglingly annoying (power walk, ugh, power walk) and then throughout the workout there are a few seconds here and there without any music. Kind of makes keeping the beat a little more difficult.",1163376000,8,999,4.702857142857143

1835155,5,B00008DDJD,"This is my favorite of all my exercise tapes/dvds.  The music in this one is really good.  I catch myself humming ""walk, power walk"" off & on during the day. I have a new role model - Alton is 72 years old.  I want to move that good when I'm his age. That's the motivation for me getting up at 6:00 every morning and taking this awesome walk with Leslie & these happy, healthy folks. I'll be putting this dvd into a few Christmas stockings this year.",1162684800,2,450,4.149425287356322

Having said that, I really love working out to both dvd's. This one is nice because you need absolutely no equipment, and there is a bit more of a stretching segment at the end. It takes 56 minutes to complete and the Abs one takes 45 mins.

This is excellent, excellent exercise, and Leslie is a very positive and seemingly lovely person. It's nice to have someone like that in my living room, helping me be healthy!!",1162598400,12,690,4.425196850393701
1835162,5,B00008DDJD,"I started doing Leslie's tapes again two months ago.  I had 3 of her other videos and ordered two more.  This one is by far the very best.  I especially like that there is no apparatus; it's a great cardio workout without the unneccesary frill, and it will make you sweat, sweat, sweat. In the last year, I have gone through surgery and chemo, and been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.  If this former couch potato can do this workout anyone can - except my 27-year-old granddaughter.  Sbe's only made it through the first two miles.

  People complain about Leslie's talking, but it's really not too bad, and you can tune her out after awhile.  Another critism I've read is that not everyone is using the right form.  So what.  If you know what to do, do it.",1161561600,5,763,4.4963503649635035
1835163,5,B00008DDJD,"This is my first WATP video, but I started at the highest mile because I am an intermediate/advanced exerciser so I knew I needed something high intensity to get my heart rate going, but mostly I was looking for variety in my workout.  And I must say, I just love this video.  It is the only video I own that MAKES me want to do it.  I truly enjoy working out, but when I find a workout that makes it fun and mixes things up, I know I hit the jackpot.  This workout can be perfect for most exercisers, although beginners probably want to start with her starter videos and gradually work up to the Super Challenge.  Leslie is a good instructor, but as most have mentioned, she does talk quite a bit and has a very annoying laugh.  But its about the workout, not the sound of her voice, and in that, WATP Super Challenge accomplishes alot.  I hope to buy more of her videos in the future.",1160438400,6,886,4.207100591715976
1835164,5,B00008DDJD,"The 4 mile super challenge is great! I did it for the first time with my mother today and we both agreed it went by so fast.  Leslie lets you know when you've reached each mile.  There is so much energy in the whole group.  They really keep you motivated.  One thing that annoyed me is the music in the warmup and beginning of the workout.  You can fix that by muting your television, though.  My mother and I totally recommend this workout! We are going to do it twice a week :o) and the other days alternate with her other dvds that we own (1-3 mile walk, Walk and Jog, Walk and Kick, and Power Mile). I hope to lose weight doing this and eating better.  After reading the previous reviews on how people lost weight doing this I'm convinced it will help me too!",1157155200,4,763,4.184931506849315

I use this one about once a week because it is longer than the others (60 min) and because I'm usually drenched with sweat at the end of it. It's got her core moves (marching, kicks, side steps, knee lifts), but she has jazzed things up a bit.  It's a good pace and a great workout.

It would be nice though for her production company to improve the features on the DVD though (no menus is one thing). The meter only shows up after each mile and that can be a little discouraging.

My only complaints about the workout itself is that there's not as much concentration on the arms and that the stretching is less than adequate.",1156809600,8,706,4.333333333333333

I am so glad I did- I just love this, the added Mile (15 more minutes basically) is so nice, not too much, not too hard, but a good healthy 60 minute walking workout that I believe can work for anyone of any age and you do not need much space to do, so even if you have a small living room this still can work for you!

Fun, motivating, I never get bored never get tired of the WATP!

I get up before my kids every morning and get 4 miles in before they even get up- helps me feel great all day long!

I highly recommend this workout Dvd for all!",1155772800,8,734,3.6923076923076925

I started off with Leslie's 2 mile work outs..I have a brisk walk dvd and then another that uses the weights. In all honesty, all her workouts are worth the money. Leslie does love to chat through the workout but it makes the time fly by. When I first heard of Leslie and her workouts, I did not even entertain the thought of a walking video..I love to sweat and just assumed that I would not get that kind of result. Boy was I wrong....",1155513600,6,540,4.41
1835168,5,B00008DDJD,"I have found this exercise very do-able and enjoyable, even though I am 70+ years. It moves along briskly.  I'd highly recommend it.",1154822400,8,132,4.739130434782608
1835169,5,B00008DDJD,My sister and I love this in home walking DVD.  It is the best Leslie has done so far.  We do it every day.  It doesn't even seem like an hour.  I encouarge everyone to who enjoys walking to try it.,1154563200,,198,3.7560975609756095
1835170,5,B00008DDJD,"I love this workout!!  Being in average shape, I began working out with Leslie's 3 mile Super Fat Burning and then progressed to this one and the 5 mile workout when I needed more of a challenge.  This one is my favorite, it has good music, no annoying instructors (my problem with the 3 mile tape) and a good warm up (my only quibble with the 5 mile tape is the complete lack of a warm up).  I feel like this workout is a challenge and makes you pour sweat, but I do not feel wiped out and good for nothing else the rest of the day (like, say, after doing an hour long The Firm workout).  In addition, my leg muscles are visible now, especially the line down the outside of my thigh, I assume from all the side steps.  I like that.  Overall, a great tape, delivers on the walk away the pounds promise!",1150848000,13,802,4.108974358974359
1835171,5,B00008DDJD,"I have about 10-12 of Leslie's work-out DVD's.  I also have a basement shelf full of other work-out DVD's - Abs of Steel - Richard Simmons - Tae-Bo - Pilate's and many, many more.  I'm 48 almost 49 years old, and I have been looking - for most of my adult life - for in-home work-out videos that didn't hurt me, showed quick results and didn't bore me to tears after about a week or two of using them.

Leslie's unique low-impact work-out is a dream come true for me.  I am totally uncoordinated - so the very fast paced work-out videos always left me in the dust.  The slower ones like Pilate's were a tremendous work-out that left me totally exhausted, but with no cardio work-out.  Who wants to go for an intense cardio work out after 45 minutes of intense strength training??  OK - some people may say, ""ME!""  But not this couch potato!  I HATE to work out - always have, but know it's essential to good health.  Leslie's work-outs are so easy to follow.  She has her basic steps that she incorporates throughout all of her work-outs that I have and a three year old could follow the basic steps.

I bought the set of Walk Away the Pounds Express DVD's and it came with the stretchy.  You don't even need the stretchy with this WATP Express 4 mile work-out and it still amazes me how fast these routines go!  But you will have a TREMENDOUS strength and cardio work-out!

I was a total unmovable couch potato from November 2005 prior to Thanksgiving until early March 2006 due to a mysterious chronic joint pain problem that left me with daily headaches and migraines (thought to by Fibromyalgia).  So I was utterly out of shape.  A doctor treated me with steroids and by early March - the pain had gone away.  So I was ready to move again and chose Leslie's Walk Away the Pounds Deluxe Edition 2 DVD pack.  I started with her first and very basic work-out and even though I hadn't lifted a finger to exercise in all that time - I was only slightly sore in the upper part of my body the next day.

This was with a sprained ankle that had just begun to heal and a hyper extended opposite knee due to favoring the ankle and coming out of the shower and slipping on water.  But because Sansone so carefully warms up and the work-out is so low impact (especially her beginner ones)  and she also allows you to modify any movements - I was able to gradually work up to her 2nd DVD and third in the series and then wanted to move on.

So I bought Walk Away the Pounds Express 1 & 2 and Walk Away the Pounds Express 3 in a set and then added WATP Express 4 shortly thereafter.  For variety I also now use WATP Walk and kick - 33 minutes and I swear you'll be kick-boxing, working up a tremendous sweat and LOVING IT.  I can't believe I AM KICKBOXING!  It goes so fast as most all of her work-outs do!

I also - for variety --  use WATP Walk and Jog - I NEVER jog - I always hated to jog as it would hurt my ankles and my lungs would feel like they're on fire.  But I jog with Leslie!

Just read the reviews for each one and see which ones are or aren't for you - but I'm telling you - without changing my diet in any significant way - it is now May 26th and I've lost 12 pounds and two pant sizes and could squeeze into a size 4 again!  That may not seem much - but I'm very petite, 5'2"", and small boned (ring size 4 ).  So three or four pounds on me is a pant size.  My arms are toned, my stomach is much flatter, the ""tire"" around my hips has melted away.  I also feel GREAT - and have much more motion to a once stiff neck and other joints that were still pretty stiff due to no exercise for so long.

And I WANT to do her work-outs.  I look forward to them every day!  But you don't even have to do them every day; I do them about four or five times a week.

If you've tried them all and believe me - I know where you're coming from - try Leslie.  A gorgeous young, fit runner in our church borrowed one of the early DVD's of Leslie's from me and she LOVES it and is going to buy all of the WATP DVD's because she said she's so sick of just running on the treadmill!

Vary your work- out - and get healthy - get numerous Leslie Sansone DVD's but if you're a beginner - do what I did and get her set.  Start with the basics - and you'll be so surprised how fast you'll be moving on up to her longer more challenging routines.

What's also great about her work-outs is - if you don't have time that day to do her longer one - you'll STILL get a great fat-burning work-out with any one of her shorter videos like Walk and Kick or Walk and Jog.  Get her DVD's today and begin a life of fitness!",1148601600,61,4591,4.065701559020044
1835179,3,B00008DDJD,"I agree with the other review that stated this is a nice workout because you didn't need anything additional like a stretchie, etc. to work out.  Sometimes I just want the straight walking.

However, I find the workout to be a little slow.  I enjoyed some of the different moves in this as opposed to her other videos like the grapevine, the double kickback and the double sidesteps with a tap.  However, I own Leslie's 5 mile tape and that is definitely an advanced level workout with 1 of the miles being only 10 minutes.  This tape was close to 1 full hour for 4 miles and her 5 mile advanced tape is only 62 minutes. So for only 2 minutes more I can get an extra mile in.

This tape is nice though when I don't want a full on harder workout like her 5 mile tape.  But I do wish she did a more fast moving 4 mile workout.",1147219200,29,824,4.080745341614906
1835180,5,B00008DDJD,"I used the 3 mile and saw that she made a 4 mile and decided , what the heck!

I love it!

The music is more current as can be and it really works. I did it at least 4 times a week and in the first week I really noticed the difference in my pants first.

My thighs were smaller and my waist was a bit smaller too.

So I continued my use and people started to notice so I was all about this. Soon enough I had started off by giving mine away...I owned 2 and she loved it. In my eyes she didn't need to lose anything but it's great for toning and your mind.

You CAN challenge yourself when doing it too. Use weights and I learned some other moves from some of ehr other videos so i jusi incorporate those when I can.

I am LOOKING FOR A 5 MILE LESLIE!!!

I know it will be even better than the 4!

If you guys can't do it all then just do what you can and be pleased with yourself that you at least got up and moved!

Thanks for reading.

1835181,3,B00008DDJD,"I really like this DVD.  I think Leslie is great. However it is not very challenging for advanced level.  I had to do the tape two times almost to get a really good sweat and I am 50 years old.  This is proberly because I already do 4 or 5 miles.  I just worked a little harder than she did to get my heart beat up where it needed to be.  What I am going to do when I do this work out is add my step that I use with another tape and that will really get my heartbeat where it needs to be in an hour.  It is really sad because this can be a great tape.

I really liked the music also however the only reason I gave it 3 stars was because it just is not very challenging.

I would say this is for a person that is just starting to work out.",1146009600,4,738,3.656050955414013
1835182,5,B00008DDJD,"This 4-mile walk video is one of my favorite of Leslie's that I have in my collection.  It may be 4-miles long, but all the usual steps from her previous videos are within this video.  I love doing this workout when I have the time for an hour long w/o.  I like the people that are in the video as well.  In some of her earlier videos, the people exercising with her are yacking away and don't seem to be quiet, but this one isn't like that.  Of course, the usual Leslie chatter is in this one, but it is what makes her unique and, in my opinion, doesn't take away anything from the video.  If you like her videos and want something new thrown into the mix, then I would recommend buying this w/o as a great addition to the Leslie collection.",1145577600,10,742,4.153846153846154

It has a nice warm-up, and brisk walking that takes you through to the cool down and some stretching at the end (it's 58 minutes of workout).  You don't use any weights, but with the pace of the walk, it probably would be hard to keep up with weights, unless you are superfit.  I love the music, the walkers are fun and Leslie is an upbeat bundle of energy.  She is the best reason for buying this tape.",1144972800,8,456,4.089887640449438

I did have to give myself a pep talk on the 3rd mile the first week, but after 1 week of diligently doing the workout I have the endurance to keep up the pace. Its such a ""non-threatening"" no-nonsense approach to burning that butter!",1142553600,11,391,4.297297297297297
1835186,5,B00008DDJD,"I have several of Leslie's dvds and this one is my favorite now.  It gives me a great workout-she gets my heart rate up, but alternates enough to allow some recovery during the routine.  The energy levels of the walkers are high on this one, which helps keep me going.  She has some varying moves as well.  Will do a double kick-back, double side step with a tap and another with a kickback.  Also included the classic grapevine - which I have never liked - but actually enjoy it in this routine. (okay truth is I could never do the grapevine-at least not way back when & avoided it like the plague!)

I have her other 4mile one - but it is an old version (so 1980's styles)- it's a good workout, because of the different moves (some I have not seen in other dvds)however, Leslie was a little less experienced and cues leave a lot to be desired.

Since I bought the 4-mi Express I have not used the old 4mile one, but still alternate with other dvds.  If you are ready to advance past the 3 mile and sweat you will love this one.  Plus you burn so many calories!",1142553600,10,1062,4.217821782178218

She was diagnosed with high blood pressure and high cholesterol and her doctor warned her she was a candidate for a heart attack. I actually screened the DVD prior to giving it to her and found the moves to be simple yet effective. I was worried that my mom would be intimidated by the moves but she LOVES it!! After a few months of regularly working out to this DVD & eating right she has lost weight, has better posture and feels energized. UPDATE: Today is a great day: my mom got her cholesterol test results and she went from a 256 down to 115!! Her doctor was FLOORED and said she has never seen such a drastic decrease. My mom thanked me for ""saving her life"" by introducing her to this DVD - it totally motivated her and she got AMAZING results. I work out with this DVD too - I enjoy it immensely, Leslie is so personable, it really feels like she's talking to you. I highly recommend this DVD if you are starting your first workout regimen or just want a great, non-jarring cardio workout. Thanks Leslie!!",1140480000,24,1097,4.278846153846154
1835188,5,B00008DDJD,"This is the first Leslie Sansone video I've ever bought and used. It really gave me a great workout! The first time I did the walk, I wasn't planning on doing all 4 miles, but ended up doing so anyway. It was very easy to get into, and once I did, the time, and miles, went by very quickly.

The moves you do aside from the vigorous walking are simple, and you can modify them to suit your fitness level, if needed. There are front kicks, knee ups, side steps (single and double), all of which you can opt to use arm movements with.

The energy of the people in the class is very high and it definitely helped me to stay motivated. I try to match my pace to theirs, and then increase it even more to really up my heart rate. I also modify the double side steps by adding a shuffle and/or hop, and using arm movement, even when the rest of the class isn't using arms. Of course, not everyone may want to do this, but I like to work harder when I have the energy flowing.

Leslie is great and very uplifting. She tends to talk a lot, which can be a little annoying, but at the same time, it helps to focus on what she's saying, rather than how much time is left.

There are people of all ages in this video, and they actually work up a visible sweat. That was nice to see, since in most exercise workouts, all they do is smile inanely and make it seem like it's a cakewalk, while you're breathing hard and working up a good sweat. At least in this video, you can see that everyone's exerting themself and are sweating right along with you.

One slight complaint I have is how quickly the pace starts to decrease before you've even completely reached the end of the 3rd mile. And from the 3rd-4th mile, it decreases significantly and I'm already close to my starting heart rate. So, I've just gotten into the habit of still keeping my pace intense until maybe 5 mins before I reach the 4th mile, and the cooldown.

Another minor complaint is that they don't show you when you've reached a half mile or any point in between miles. Leslie just tells you when you're 'close' to completing a particular mile, and then when you're done with it. It'd be a little bit easier if I had an idea of where the half mile mark was between each mile, in case I only felt like doing 2.5 miles, etc, rather than all 4. Of course, I have the VHS version, so maybe the dvd is slightly different.

Those issues aside, it's a great workout and a wonderful asset to my other videos.",1140134400,16,2457,4.214893617021277
1835208,5,B00008DDJD,"Combined with a sensible eating program, I lost 15 pounds in two weeks using  this DVD and two other 3-mile and 4-mile workouts by Leslie, 3 Mile Super Fat Burning and Weight Loss Walk. I used them six days a week and the pounds just melted way.  I couldn't believe it. I used a pedometer with this and I actually did go 4 miles.

I believe the success of these workouts is based upon their simplicity. There are only four basic steps:marching(walking), kicks, leg curls and high knees. For variety, Leslie sometimes doubles the moves or travels short distances. Another bonus is that the DVD does not require a lot of space. I could do the entire workout in my tiny dorm room with no problem. It was easy to get started and stick with the program. Additionally, my knees sometimes bother me so it was nice to have good low impact workout that was easy on my knees and back.

Another caveat of this program is that there are no high impact moves, so you're never so sore that you can't workout the next day.

Leslie is very encouraging as an instructor. She cues well and her counting is always right on. The only drawback, and I wouldn't throw it away because of this, is that she laughs just like Fran Drescher (the Nanny) and talks almost constantly.  However, you soon get used to it and after using the DVD consistently you can just play your own music and put her on mute.  The music is very techno and kept a good pace to keep you motivated.  The scenery includes a regular exercise studio and the people exercising with Leslie are of all different ages and sizes. It makes you think if that Grandma can do it, I can't dare sit down.

Overall I highly recommend this video for its' efficacy. You will see results! Just get off that couch and get moving! :)",1138752000,34,1763,4.4
1835209,5,B00008DDJD,"I'm 46, and I feel so good doing this walk everyday. I get it done first thing in the morning, or else I end up not fitting it into my day. In the past month, I have lost 10 pounds of weight that has been my nemesis for the past three years. I like to do 10 minutes of my own intense stretching after the 4 mile walk, because that's when my muscles are warmest and it's an ideal time to do this. I also follow up with the ""Breathworks"" abdominal routine (book is available on Amazon) after I cool down, the best program I've found for healing bad backs, and one that I recommend to any of my patients that suffers from back pain.(And no, I am not in any way affiliated with Breathworks, except that I think the program is exceptional.)

I love how fast the 4 miles go when I'm following along with this DVD. Leslie is personable and fun-loving, and I believe this to be a better muscle-worker than a regular walk outdoors, because she does vary the leg and footwork. Yet at the end, I simply feel rejuvenated. My stress is relieved by this workout, and I seem to be ready to accomplish more during the day.",1138579200,20,1106,4.216981132075472
1835210,5,B00008DDJD,"First of all, I must say that the music with which she starts all of the workouts in this series drives me absolutely nuts.  Luckily, it only repeats for the first five minutes or so and the rest of the music is fairly good as workout music goes.  Hopefully she'll pick less annoying music with which to start the workouts in future series.

Also, as far as I know, this is the longest and most difficult of the videos she offers, but my comments (and approbation) pretty much apply to all of her videos that I have used-- they are all very good, for the reasons set forth below.

I love all the Walk Away the Pounds videos because she focuses on simple movements that can be modified to work for people of almost any fitness level.  Unless you are at a very high cardio fitness level already (and if so, you probably aren't doing things like exercise videos) this should work for you because it's all in how you do the moves-- it can be easy, moderate or difficult depending on the intensity with which you do the movements.

And-- important for me-- the moves are easy to master.  There's no complicated (and unexplained) choreography like a lot of other videos on the market which, in my opnion, are injuries waiting to happen.

Another interesting thing about her videos is that, while ""perky"" personalities usually drive me up the wall (and she does tend to be relentlessly perky on camera) I actually like her and find her to be a motivating instructor.  I enjoy her videos so much that I intend to get a variety of 2, 3 and 4 mile workouts to use as a regular part of my fitness routine.

Plus, they are perfect to have on hand in inclement weather, and as a Seattleite this is very important to me.",1136851200,16,1706,4.404458598726115

I have the 1, 2, and 3 mile DVD and all 3 of these do use the weights.  This is a one hour workout and 4 miles but because of the lack of weights, it seemed somewhat easier than the 3 mile DVD that I already had.",1136073600,12,343,3.684931506849315

The pace and beat of the music don't match and there are some brief pauses when the music changes, which can cause one to lose their pace.  Overall, I like the extra challenge of the 4 miles, and am now looking for something to help tone my arms separately.",1135814400,3,578,4.2272727272727275

As a diehard Leslie fan I was glad to see that there are no 'extras' you have to have like belts, stretchies or weights of any kind. This is a very brisk 4 miles and you really feel like you have done some work when you're finished. It starts with a warmup but goes into a pretty upbeat pace very quickly. There is a section between the 2 and 3 miles where Leslie says, 'This is as brisk as it gets,"" which is nice because you know the really fast part is over soon. By mile 3 it's a little slower(but not much) and you are really feeling good by mile 4. I highly recommend this workout for intermediate and advanced walkers. However, as with all of Leslie's tapes, you can always choose to do just one or some of the miles if you like. Be ready for a challenge with this one, though!",1133654400,15,927,4.0989010989010985

Although it is a good workout, the movements get tedious.  She doesn't introduce enough variation to really get you into this workout.  I found myself looking at the clock wondering how long until I could stop.

I may be marching in my living room all alone, but I never feel like I am really alone when I'm exercising with this series.  I've gotten to know all of Leslie's ""Walking Buddies"" by name, and I feel like I am right there with them.  As other reviewers have already stated, anyone can do these workout, no matter how much they weigh, or how old they are. I like the fact that the walkers in the video are all different shapes and sizes and ages, and look like they feel good about themselves--self-esteem is a big issue when you are using videos to help lose weight! Leslie herself has the right personality for leading others to good health while having fun!

I had a stretchy band at home, but you can easily just do the motions with your arms, and not use a band, or you could substitute light weights.  I had a neck problem, and my doctor said not to use weights or the stretchie, so I just went through the motions, and it was fine.

The music in this series is better than on most of her videos--I love the warm up song that is used on each of these tapes.  Sometimes you get bored with a workout video after you have used it a while, but I haven't gotten bored with these.  Even the chit-chat doesn't bore me on this one.

If you are only going to get one Leslie Sansone video, make it one SERIES, and choose this one!  It is worth the cost of the 4 tapes or DVDs.",1131408000,12,1643,4.151419558359621

Leslie talks a lot, so she's not really working that hard.  PICK YOUR FEET UP!  Get her book and read about how she wants you to exercise.  You have to want to walk hard -- this isn't treadmill walking!!  This was the first one I ever got and I made it through the first time but couldn't work very hard.  Now I'm doing it holding one pound weights.  This will improve your cardio and help you lose weight if you do what she says, and ""PICK UP THOSE FEET!""

I was able to do the complete 4 miles relatively easily without building much a sweat....and believe me I was pushing myself. I think the excercise program would only be ok if combined with other regimens....I did a 3 mile run afterwards since I was on an exercise ""high""....now that built up alot of sweat....save your money and walk round the block!!!",1124755200,2,539,4.74468085106383

1835237,4,B00008DDJD,"I am a competitive athlete, and I wanted to add a new video to my home workout library to help me train for my upcoming fitness competitions.  I like to use videos as a way of adding variety to my cardiovascular training, but they must be aggressive and intense.  The only home videos that have lived up to the intensity challenge for me are those by Cathe Frederich and Billy Blanks.  I also do some Bosu training for stability and balance work (great!), as well as pilates for flexibility.  I thought that I was taking a risk with WATP, as I thought it would be too easy.  However, I know that jogging/walking is a great form of exercise, and one that I don't practice nearly enough.  I was hoping this tape would give me the motivation and courage to improve my jogging/running endurance and technique.

Let me tell you that I am very pleasantly surprised with this series!!  I made a few modifications to increase the workout intensity a bit (such as jogging, adding hand weights, and jumping jacks).  I was proud of my ability to keep up with Leslie.  Even without modifications, the workout is extremely effective.  I liked the way the video was filmed, and the fact that they used background exercises of all shapes, sizes, and fitness levels.  The only reason I didn't give this video 5 stars is because I found Leslie to be annoying at times, but she did a great job of keeping the pace moving.  I'm looking forward to doing this workout again!!

I also have the Super Fat Burning 3-Mile workout, which I have yet to try.  I am glad that I purchased WATP.  I am now a firm believer in the product and the principle!  Hats off to Leslie Sansone and WATP!!!!!",1123027200,10,1666,4.48172757475083

Since I always exercised a lot, I needed something that would be challening enough but not too hard for my pregnancy. For that purpose the program was perfect!

After a few months I had worked up to the 3 mile, and loved it.  Now, at 150 lbs. I ordered Leslies 4 mile video.  I think it's great.  The miles go by so fast, and you feel great afterwards.  Here's a tip:  the music on all of the videos isn't that great, and can get annoying after you've watched them 100 times.  Put on a great techno, or high beat elecronica c.d., and turn down the volume on you t.v.  It makes for a great workout.  The 4 mile doesn't use any weights like the others do, but you can add weights to her arm exercises on your own to add a little ""umph"" to the workout.  For anyone who has asthma (as I do) or has a hard time with arobics, this is a GREAT place to start.  It's addictive, and if you can make yourself do it everyday for 2 weeks, it becomes a habit after that.  I highly recommend these videos.  Hope this helps!!",1116892800,8,998,3.9696969696969697

I'd consider myself an intermediate level exerciser (I usually work out to Cathe or Beachbody videos) and I bought this video because I thought it would be a good video for a ""light"" day. I always wear a heart-rate monitor during my workouts and, when I used this video, I was always way below my aerobic zone, even when I used weights and did exaggerated movements. So my advice is to only buy this video if you're a beginner; intermediate and advanced exercisers will probably want something more intense.",1116374400,16,618,4.627272727272727
1835318,5,B00008DDJD,"I am in shape and outdoor hicking is one of my favorite activities.  Although I regularly do aerobics I decided to give this a try because I need something low impact, calorie burning so that I can lose the last 5 baby pounds, and that I can do at home while caring for my children.  This has fit in beautifully.  I wondered at first whether it would even work up a sweat - well it does.  I started with the four mile walk because a couple of miles are just a relaxing walk to me.  Well, I have to admit that it took me 4 tries before I finally completed the entire 4 miles on this DVD.  It really does provide a good workout and it can be done by anyone.  Although I am fit I can see how someone with even limited motion could do this DVD.  The only downfall is that some of Leslie's talk is a bit annoying (does she really need to tell us the ages and grandparent status of so many of her walkers) and the forced chuckles at times are too much.  But that is easily ignored.  I found this to be one of my favorite routines.",1114214400,6,1024,4.0

1835321,5,B00008DDJD,"So far this is my favorite Leslie workout because it is strictly cardio (no weights or other equipment needed), and she does such a good job of varying the routine, that the hour goes by very quickly.  Like many over-50 people, I had to stop running because of knee problems and osteoarthritis.  I discovered Leslie Sansone after 7 years of working out on an elliptical cross-trainer. Now exercise is fun again, and I look forward to this high energy hour with Leslie and her ""girls"" (plus one 72 year old gentleman!).

The 1st mile goes at a moderate pace, with miles 2 and 3 being the peak pace of the workout. If I'm feeling energetic, sometimes I jog gently, rather than power walk, to the music, but you can easily do the entire workout with low impact moves.  Mile 4 is somewhat slower, leading to the cooldown. Thus if you don't have a whole hour, you can just do the 1st 3 miles and skip to the cooldown at the end.  I was in good aerobic condition when I purchased this DVD, but I am soaked with sweat when I do the whole 4 miles.  If you miss the ""endorphin burn"" from running, give this one a try.  An aside for other over-50 folks:  my favorite walker on this DVD is 55 year old Carol - an elegant redhead who lost 60 pounds!  Carol, you are an inspiration!",1111017600,14,1269,4.298319327731092
1835322,4,B00008DDJD,"This is one of Leslie's best DVD's. A 4 mile walk that will get you going! The walk starts out fairly briskly right from the start and then builds to an even faster pace.

Leslie is accompanied by a large group of exercisers, with an age range of 20 to 72 proving this is a great workout for any age. The exercisers wear simple black workout gear with white trim at the waist, all black for Leslie (lucky her as the white trim is very unflattering). The walk is in a studio with faux brickwork in the background and the words ""Walk Away The Pounds Express"" written on the brickwork.

The walk is the basic simple to follow typical Leslie fare. Sidesteps, marches, leglifts etc. She also adds in some hands over head and other hand movements to pump up the pace. A meter at the bottom and Leslie let you know when you have completed each mile.

The biggest drawback with the workout is that Goodtimes was too cheap to chapter the DVD. So you can't easily jump from mile 1 to mile 2, 3 or 4. For the price they are charging they could easily have chaptered it.

Overall though the workout is quicker paced and longer than Leslie's other walks and a good one to get when you are ready to pump up the pace!",1110240000,12,1202,4.258771929824562

1835324,5,B00008DDJD,"I have been using the Walk Away the Pounds Express, 4 Mile walk for exactly three weeks now.  I do the workout every morning Monday through Friday.  I'm 26 and my fitness level is such that I can get through the Taebo II Advanced workouts without hyperventilating.  However, I was concerned about my knees from all the kicks and squats in Taebo.  I also don't like going to the gym, esp. living in frigid-cold Boston.  I decided to give the WATP 4M a try.

At first I was concerned that it would be so low impact that it would not really benefit me much.  But after the first time I did it, I knew that it was not a walk in the park.  I felt so buzzed and energized that day.

Having done it for three weeks, I am now beginning to see my body becoming more toned and tight.  I keep looking in the mirror at myself.  Also, my muscles have been slightly sore, so I know it is working!

The workout consists of lots of walking in place, some front kicks, side steps, a grapevine, knee lifts, and leg curls.  There is also a little upper body work (lifting your hands above your head and such).  While doing it my breathing gets a heavy at times, but I can't say that I work up a tremendous sweat (esp. not as much as a Taebo workout).  Because it is so easy to do though and doesn't kill me everytime I do it, I have been able to wake up in the morning and do it consistently.  Whereas with other videos that were much more strenuous, I would skip days because I just didn't want to go through that pain.  In the long-run because it is something I can do consistently, I know I am getting better health benefits.

WATP 4M has helped my mood stay elevated, it has firmed me up, it keeps me from getting tired in the middle of the day, I sleep more restfully at night, I think more clearly, my endurance has strengthened, and it helps my self-image because I know I am doing the best I can to take care of my body.  I have noticed a drastic difference in all these things since I started doing it every morning.

I find 10% of what Leslie says during the workout to be annoying.  I find the other 90% of what she says to be motivational.

I highly recommend WATP 4M to someone who wants to begin incorporating exercise into their lifestyle.  This is definitely that kind of video. While not the most strenuous exercise video out there, it is something you can stick to doing.

Money-wise, I'm not sure why someone would buy the 1 mile, 2 mile, and 3 mile walks.  Why not just get the 4 mile walk and work up to as many miles as you want to do?  But hey, that's just me.",1109376000,39,2564,4.150101419878296

One thing I like about this video the best is that it does have any of the extras like the stretchie you will use in the first two miles.  But, that doesn't mean it is any easier.  It is a wonderful workout and you will still sweat.  You will feel wonderful once you finish her walks and she is highly motivating--so much motivating that sometimes she annoys you in a good way.  Such as a parent might annoy one that is Leslie.  She also does easy basic steps that anyone any age can do. And the music is super great in this workout!  I find the new express sets are a great addition to my huge Leslie collection.  I encourage anyone who has mastered the basic and intermediate walks to join in on the fun of a 4 mile walk and the best part you are done in a quick hour.  It goes really fast and you will be like wow I can't believe I just walked four miles in only and hour and it was FUN!

There are arm raises, side to side walks, squats just everything to get your heart pumping and body sweating! She is also very motivational and lets you know that you are sooo worth it!

  I have 1, 2, 3 and this 4 mile walk and I have various dvd's from The Firm to spinning. Due to a back injury I am taking it easy with my back and this was the perfect workout for me!

I know some people find Leslie's chatter annoying, but for me, she's a friendly, cheerful, super motivator - like exercising with a friend.

I started with Leslie's Get Up And Get Started & High Calorie Burn 1 and 2 Mile workouts, then moved up to the 3-Mile Super Fat Burning workout. I rarely use the 1 and 2 Mile workouts anymore; I rotate the 4-Mile Super Challenge with the 3-Mile and also the Power Series Walk & Jog (good interval training).

This workout does not incorporate the use of weights, but once you know the moves for hand weights with Leslie's programs, it's easy enough to add them in. I usually add weights for the first and fourth miles, and skip using weights for the very fast-paced second and third miles.

I was already a regular exerciser and quite fit when I bought the 4-Mile Super Challenge, but still find it a good challenge. My heart rate gets raised to my target range, I sweat a good deal, and those knee lifts are excellent for the rear end!

I have recommended this workout to many of my friends and family. My mother-in-law does it regularly now too, along with the Walk & Jog.",1107907200,10,1258,4.52863436123348

Love the music in this one, it really makes you want to move.  She does talk a little much, but I just try to concentrate on the music.  Although, she is a very motivating person and really makes you want to work and get healthy.  Another thing I like about this video is to see someone sweat!  In the other ones that I have not one person drops a bead of sweat, they don't even shine a little bit and in this one someone is sweating.

1835381,5,B00008DDJD,"I bought the 4 Mile Super Challenge after doing the Walk Away the Pounds express-Walk Strong video. I like this video because it does not require any equipment. You also do not need a whole lot of space to do it, although you will move continuously through out the tape. Leslie shows you the four basic moves that you will do in the video during the warm up at the beginning. I found the upbeat, techno like music very energizing. I am in my 20's and was looking for a way to start exercising, because I really never have had a routine. I really felt encourgaged by all the people in the video who are much older and doing all the moves with me.

A lot of reviewers will tell you that Leslie talks a lot and they find it annoying, but I like it. It makes the tape go by faster and lets you know shes a real person. She also has a great message in this video, ""Think positive, What's tomorrow to bring?"" and "" You are so smart for taking care of your body. Im so proud of you."" For me, these words were very powerful and kept me going until the end of the tape. It really sent a message that I thought about even after the tape- just reminding me that I really should be taking care of myself, no matter what my age. Leslie is very sweet and bubbly and she smiles and encourages you through out the tape. If you are not a beginner and consider yourself more advanced, you can still get a great work out from this tape by sitting lower during some of the movements or kicking higher during the kicks.

Leslie really makes you want to exercise, and get up and move. I found it very encouraging as a beginner who never really had an exercise routine. I like that she talks to you during the tape because it really feels like she is talking directly to you. And she is so positive- I give this 5 stars.",1105142400,29,1797,4.1461318051575935

I was expecting a challenging workout, and this has certainly been that.  It is challenging!  One reviewer said it didn't bring up her heart rate? That's a mystery to me unless she's already an aerobic powerhouse and should be doing her own videos.  LOL

This is kind of challenging for those of us with less coordination - it requires the ability to walk and chew gum, in a way...doing backward kicks and arm lifts at the same time - that's a challenge for me, a natural clutz.  But my heart was pumping and I was sweating before the 2nd mile.  You do require more free space for movement with this workout than with the other one I have, the Three Mile Ab workout.  You are taking two to three steps forward, sideways and backwards on this one, whereas with the Ab workout, you only need about two steps on each side of you and space in front of you for kicks.  If you have very limited space to workout, this one may frustrate you - I recommend the Three Mile Ab workout for that.

The only thing I am upset with is the format of the DVD.  I bought the DVD because I didn't want to have to fast forward to the spot I wanted - I wanted to have a menu or something...to be able to skip to the cool down if I wanted to finish before the end of the workout.  Nope, still have to fast forward!  No menu!!  DVD in my opinion is nothing but a compact video tape.  LOL...it is less bulky than the VHS, but I wanted the convenience of chapter selections.

Incidentally, the Three Mile Ab workout DVD, unfortunately, is the same way.

I have been walking and doing other workout videos (Such as Crunch: Turbo Sculpt) but, when I did this video, I actually had a hard time keeping up!! It was great! I have been searching for a good aerobic workout that wasn't salsa or some other dance. I'm very uncoordinated. I'm lucky I can walk and chew bubble gum without falling!

Let me include some things that other people didn't. When I was looking at the reviews, I wanted to know more about what the video itself included. I didn't realize there was a video that was simply walking in place. It's perfect for my needs as an at home mom of two babies.

Leslie gives great signals when you're going to switch to something new, and she tells you what it is you are switching to. The video does NOT include difficult steps, I thought that was great. This is so easy to follow. The four main steps of the video are side steps; hamstring lifts; front kicks; and knee lifts. You power walking place a lot. This might SOUND very annoying and repetitive but, the time flies by. I was sweating profusely! I couldn't believe it.

I

 noticed other people saying that they didn't like Leslie's voice. I found her to be motivating and very energetic. I am a big Denise Austin fan because of that too. They both want you to GET HEALTHY, and they seem genuine in that.

You don't need any extra equipment. I loved this video because of that.  Now, I do recommend you do a strength training video with this one, as it is NOT a strength training workout. You are simply moving to lose FAT. The Crunch: Turbo Sculpt video I am doing is a strength training, muscle building, workout. So, I needed something that would help me get LEAN. I don't want to be a firm 14 I want to be a firm 10! :) I hope my review helps you. I really do love this video and am contemplating getting the three pack of the 1 through 3 mile.

Really, the only ""problem"" I had with the video was that she said the word ""NICE"" a lot and her laugh is kind of annoying. But, her words were motivating and helped the video go by FASTER! It was TRULY motivating to find out that one of the ladies was 52 years old and lost 60 pounds!!! I saw tears in her eyes! I was about to cry with her~ Keep moving and never give up on your goal!!!

I feel that Leslie is upbeat and very encouraging.  It was a lot of fun to do and very easy to follow.  The steps are not complicated like some home video exercise programs.  I definately worked up a sweat by the middle of the second mile and my heart rate was high, however I feel that it wasn't too much.  Overall, an excellent excercise video.  I would highly recommend.",1101859200,8,515,4.173469387755102

I won't allow myself any excuses for not exercising and now that I have this DVD, it's hard to turn away from it.

Great for anyone who has never worked out before.  Not intimidating or complicated.

Great for anyone who is active and wants to mix things up.

I love it because it gets me moving and it helps to start my day off right.  I alternate between this and yoga and I feel very healthy.  I've always been active-i.e. running, yoga, pilates and I will be honest and say that I'm not sweating buckets (although, I am glistening;).  I'm not a big believer in ""no pain, no gain"", so this is perfect.

Only complaints--steps can be repetitive (what you'd expect from a walk workout) and her voice--rather do without (*mute).  All in all, I highly suggest this to anyone.",1097625600,11,887,4.41358024691358

It was very similar to the 2 Mile Walk except there were a few new faces, there was less arm movements (easily fixed by adding some), more banter with the perticipiants in the video, everyone wore similar outfits, the background was ""tougher"" in appearance, and the music beat slowley progressed to a faster pace than in the 2 Mile video. Thankfully the last mile in the 4 Mile slowed down or I would not have been able to finish the video!

It was extreemly easy to follow and she only incorporates the grapevine steps once near the end.

I don't understand what all the annoyed reviews about Leslie's refrences to God and Heaven was about! She did not come off as overly or offensivly religious to me. She was her usualy gragarious self! I also found the music to be very apropriate. Just don't turn it up too loud and you will not notice the lyrics refer to walking and exercising.

The only criticism I have for the video is I did not like Leslie's hair, and they did not show mph on the meter when it popped up at each mile mark.",1095292800,14,1068,4.303482587064677
1835401,5,B00008DDJD,"I'm very familiar with Leslie's other WATP videos and own many of them.  This is my new favorite!

I love that this one doesn't use any weights or other props because I can take it out of town with me and easily watch it on my laptop and exercise in a hotel room or when visiting relatives.

I love that Leslie and all of the participants are super upbeat throughout.  Her encouraging words are definitely what a person wants to hear when exercising.

The music is great.  I don't know what other posters are complaining about.  It's varied and appropriate.  Besides, after you've done Leslie's workout several times, you can turn down the sound and play a CD of your favorite dance tunes instead.  All exercise music gets boring after hearing it over and over.

I would recommend rotating this one with Leslie's other workouts that include the weights or any other workout that uses weights for toning.  Variety is the spice of life and choosing to do the very same workout every day is a recipe for disaster.  Rotate!  This one would be a great one to do twice per week and do a different one once or twice a week.",1093910400,9,1116,4.465346534653466

The movements are easy to do and the videos help to keep me motivated and really work!  The DVD doesn't split up the workouts in the menu screen and that is about the only problem that I had.  These workouts are not for experienced runners, athletes, or people looking for a really intense challenge.  This is more of a challenge for people that are getting back or starting an exercise program.  These videos have helped me to lose weight and get healthier.

I was so excited and pumped as I was just getting into it that I was literally almost crying.  I know ... corny!!  I can't explain it, but I just got all emotional.  I think it was because I was so proud of myself that I was actually DOING this high intensity cardio workout in the first place.  Leslie is a super lady and I really love her videos, although my collection has just started.  I was sweating before the workout was over.  Sweating is good!  When it was over - 4 miles in 1 hour - I was really, really proud of myself.  I suffer from asthma and I am overweight (I'd like to lose about 50 lbs).  If I can do this, so can you!  Oh yeah, the man that is in the video is 72 years old, and looks fabulous.  Even more inspiration for all of us.  Anyway, I highly recommend giving this workout a try.

Loved the music--very hip and dancey, like club music, which I love. I have done this workout 2 or 3 times so far and it is fantastic. ""Joyful"" is the word that came to mind when I was doing it. The miles go by so fast, there was never a point where I was thinking ""OH GAWD, when are we getting to the next mile?!""

Leslie manages to be energizing and engaging without getting into that whole cheerleader thing that other aerobic instructors have.  Her cues are wonderful and the steps extremely easy to follow, and you'll see results within a week. This is a focused power-walk workout that anyone can do, no matter what shape you're in.

In a couple of weeks I noticed the pounds started to come off.  I was very excited when I saw the 4 mile DVD advertised and could not wait to get it. The tape is very upbeat and fast paced.  You will certainly work up a sweat!! I have been working out for almost 3 months and have lost *40 pounds* durning that time.

1835441,2,B00008DDJD,"I've done other Walk Away the Pounds DVDs, and I've enjoyed them - they're perfect for the days when you don't feel like doing anything, or you know you can't concentrate, but you still need to get some cardio in.  Even though every DVD in the series has faults, overall, they're fairly good.  But this one - this one has so many problems it's almost unusable.
This DVD is really inconvenient.  There aren't any chapter titles, so you can't skip around; if you want to go straight to mile 2 or 3 (and the faster pace) after the warmup, you can't, and you also can't easily repeat a given chapter.  And I don't know why she advises you to quit if you're tired, since you can't go straight to the cool down.  So there's no point to buying the DVD - it's exactly like having this on VHS.
And if being hard to use wasn't enough, this one's also annoying.  Other reviewers have mentioned the music, and yes, it truly is that awful.  For the first 15 minutes, the ""music"" consists of a synthesizer beat and angry, shouting people.  And they're shouting about walking, too, so you feel like you're exercising in a brainwashing session.  The religious comments don't help with the whole brainwashing feeling, either; being instructed to lift my arms up to heaven and shout hallelujah does not inspire me to exercise *or* pray.
Also, the exercise isn't vigorous enough to qualify as a ""super challenge""; it's not a lot different than the 2 mile DVD, say, just longer.  My heart rate didn't elevate enough until I got to the highest-paced part of the program. So if the other WAtP programs are too easy for you, know that this one will be, too.  (And I am not some gymbot, either; I'm fat, out of shape, and clumsy, so if this is too easy for me, it's too easy for almost everyone.)
If you're totally new to exercise, or you need very gentle programs, get Sansone's 1 or 2 mile DVD; you can always repeat the program when you need to add time, and it will be much easier than trying to fast-forward and rewind your way through this one.  If you've been exercising for a while or you're at all fit, get Crunch Cardio Salsa or some other cardio DVD.  In any case, don't bother with this one.",1081382400,25,2179,4.4175

I got a very good workout in 30 minutes, so I then ordered Walk Away the Pounds Express Two Pack.  That includes one, two, and three mile walks.  Feeling energized, I then ordered the four mile walk.  What a good workout!  You really work up a good sweat and work every part of your body.  I have since bought the abs workouts.  I rotate from workout to workout, never getting bored.  Yes, Leslie talks a lot, but if you're not in the mood for her chatting, just press mute and put on your own music.  I have never been so enthusiastic about a program.  I actually look forward to my workouts and have stuck to the program since mid-December (It is now March 23, 2004.

1835444,5,B00008DDJD,"I just have to ask myself what planet I've been living on all these years Leslie has been cranking out her walk aerobic workouts because I never knew such a great fitness program existed - until this year.  In January, I purchased several of Leslie's ""Walk Away The Pounds"" DVDs in an effort to do something about the extra weight I'd been complacent about losing.  I didn't want to fail with programs that were too intense or demanding and walk aerobics sounded like someting I could do.  Smartest choice I could have made.
I think what is so satisfying about WATP is that it really is doable for anyone at any fitness level.  Leslie encourages you all along the way and provides modifications to all the movements for those who don't have full range of motion or whose muscles may not be up to strenuous activity.
Because the motions and steps are easy to perform, bystanders may get the impression that these programs can't possibly deliver a good cardio workout - but nothing could be further than the truth!  The cumulative affect of all those knee lifts, kicks and side steps not only gets your heart pumping but within only a few weeks you will see visible slimming and toning of your body.  I've only been doing the workouts since the middle of January, and already I am very encouraged with the results.
All of Leslie's workouts are fun, challenging and addictive.  I am currently doing this WATP Express 4-mile workout followed by the WATP 3-mile with weights on a daily basis - and I'm just a beginner!  If you can move, you can enjoy these workout and reap the benefits of a healthier happier life and a cute new shape.

THE SIMPLICITY OF THE STEPS (SIDE STEPS, KICKS, KNEE LIFTS AND KICK BACKS) MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TRIP OVER MY OWN FEET.  THERE IS A ""GRAPEVINE"" STEP ADDED TOWARDS THE END OF THE WORKOUT THAT ADDS A BIT OF VARIETY AND MORE FUN.

I'm also not the fittest person in the world.  Actually, Leslie's DVD was the first exercise tape (other than yoga) that I've ever bought that I've been able to complete the first time... with arms!  Given that, it's probably targeted towards beginners/advanced beginners.  Still, a great workout...lots of fun.  The mile meter updates really help keep you motivated.

I bought this in the DVD format because I wanted to be able to do 1 or 2 miles then quickly get to the stretching segment at the end without prolonged fast-forwarding that one would need to do with a VHS tape. The ability to do this is a huge advantage DVDs have over VHS format. Most of my workout DVDs have this feature.
Unfortunately, this DVD is not formatted that way. You cannot go back to a main menu then select the cool-down stretch. If you want to get to the end you have to step it forward, i.e. fast forward. On my DVD player this is even slower than fast forward on a VCR.
So when I don't do the whole workout I do my own stretching routine. But had I known this before buying the DVD I would have bought the VHS tape.",1073865600,4,820,4.03680981595092

I even make up some of my own moves while stepping but it's similar to the walking moves in the video.  Anyways, Leslie is a very motivating sweet person to workout to.

You find really good low-impact moves, and very easy direction on how to do each move.  There are no complex aerobics to learn, if you can walk you can do this workout.  Leslie also does a great job at reminding us to stay healthy and drink our water and the other walkers in the video are realistic people rather than super-thin crazy workout gurus.

1835483,5,B00008DDJD,"This video is the newest in my Leslie Sansone collection.  I first purchased the Walk Off and Firm Off Weight videos circa 1992.  Last year, I purchased the three pack set (1, 2, and 3 mile) fat burning videos that use the weighted balls (I use 2 and 3 pound dumbells). It was time for a longer program (approximately one hour) for those days when I feel more energetic.  Enter Walk Away the Pounds Express, 4-mile Super Challenge.
The four basic moves are the same as her other videos, power walking, side steps, knee lifts, and leg kicks.  They are done in various order and intensity so your muscles do not get bored.  The tape starts off slowly, and builds to an excellent fat burning pace within the first mile, then gets even more intense by mile two and three.  Mile four moves more slowly as your heart rate needs to go down at a good pace before cooldown exercises.  Cooldown is similar to her other videos, some calf and lower back stretching.  There is no jogging unless you want to!  The music is enjoyable, however, I did not like the opening ""song.""  It featured a man's voice that repeated the words ""walk and walk"" over again.  That's what it sounded like to me.  A few of the ""girls"" walking with Leslie were featured in some of her earlier videos, so it seemed like this was the ""reunion"" walk.  I always enjoy the bantering that goes on between her and the ""girls.""  Her talkativeness does not bother me, I like her upbeat personality and comments.  She seems very genuine, and the ""girls"" seem like everyday people who sometimes struggle with their weight.  She also features a very nice looking young ""70ish"" man who walks with the ""girls.""
This video does not have as much arm movement as some of the other Leslie videos.  It does not use any equipment, such as weights.  I prefer more arm movement, so I add my own when desired.  I use this video about once or twice per week, alternating with going to the gym for the weights and elliptical machine, and use her other fat burning 2 and 3 mile walk with weights. You can also walk one, two, or three miles and go to cooldown, depending upon how much time and energy you have.  It's not necessary to do the entire tape every time.
Overall, this is a great video!  It's easy on the joints while giving you a great calorie burning workout in a decent amount of time.  Did I mention I've lost 15 pounds and lots of inches so far using her tapes along with Weight Watchers over an 11 week period?

Even the music and color scheme seemed more intense.  The ONLY thing I didn't like was that there wasn't much upper-body work.",1062028800,4,443,4.353658536585366
1835486,3,B00008DDJD,"I have the three mile video and bought this one hoping for some variety. This video features the SAME people as the Three Mile Walk Away The Pounds and, worse, the SAME music. I also found her reminders to not exert myself repetitive (this goes for the 3-mile tape too).
  Don't get me wrong, I like her upbeat, vocal-less music, but I wanted some variety.
  However, if you don't have one of her other tapes, this is a great in-home walking tape. She's very energetic and genuine. That's a nice way to begin the day.",1062028800,3,517,4.410526315789474
1835541,3,B00008DDJD,"I bought this video because it is currently a bit too hot outside for power walking or jogging. The tape gives you a walk alright, and I can work up a pretty good sweat: the moves are very easy to learn, and basically are just walking in place, side steps, knee ups, little forward kicks and backward kicks, with a few moves doubled at times. The music is Ok by exercise tape standards, and I really do like a couple of the segments that have a strong drum beat. The exercisers in the background all have very firm bodies, and what seem to me to be rather fake smiles, and I would have liked to have seen a few people with extra poundage who jiggle a bit, as I do! The main complaint that I have is that Leslie Ransone talks solid for the full hour, and I can think of nobody (including my lovely husband and kids) that I want to hear non-stop for an hour! She doesn't stop talking through the whole video, and it gets very old very fast to hear all that talk over and over again. There is no way to keep the music and lose the chat, so now, when it's a hot evening outside, and I do the video, I simply turn off the volume, start a great cassette tape I have of fast songs recorded from the radio (oldies from the late 1960s that I really love, I'm 47 years old by the way), and simply watch the video for visual clues as to when to change step. I would much rather walk outside, and in the house, I like Kathy Smith for weight training, Karen Voight for stretching, and Richard Simmons' ""Sweatin' to the Oldies"" series for very fun aerobic sessions that always feel like I'm at a party! I would say that this walking tape is fine for getting you moving in a way that does indeed simulate an energetic walk, but if you, like me, really dislike non-stop chat, then you might find yourself getting irritated as I did.",1060732800,12,1816,4.191428571428571
1835542,4,B00008DDJD,"This is my 2nd pregnancy and none of the pregnancy tapes out there really suited me.  They were ancient in most instances or way too easy.  Now, always check with your doctor but this it would seem that any of Leslie's tapes would be doable while pregnant or of course, not pregnant.  I felt like this was actually a little too fast paced for when you get bigger but I modified and was still ok.  Not pregnant and following all the steps, this would be a great workout.  Again, I can't stress enough to check with your doctor about any exercise while pregnant but mine ok'd exercise and said walking was just fine.",1057881600,,614,4.398230088495575
1835543,5,B00008DDJD,"Absolutely wonderful.  Leslie I'm waiting for the 5 and 10 mile editions.  I really feel wonderful. I'm becoming so strong, that I use the 2 and 3 mile cassettes to warm up for the real workout and my other exercises.  Hurry up, I can't wait for the 5 mile workout. By the way I've gone from size 14 pants to an 8.

1835544,5,B00008DDJD,"I'm 33, in good shape and was looking for a little variety to break up going to the gym everyday. I started trying Leslie's 1, 2, 3 and 4 mile work outs. These are quick, fun and challenging. It's shaken up my metabolism and I've managed to lose even more weight while doing them, coupled with a healthful diet of course. You will NOT be sorry! Althought 1,2,3,4 requires weights, you can use your own -- you don't have to buy the Walk Away weights. I had some 3 pound dumb bells which I used. Just choose 2 or 3 pound weights. You won't be alternating them, so just choose 2 or 3 pounds -- whatever works for you.
Also - these are great tapes if you have knees problems. Even at my young age, I have a trick knee from a previous injury. I would love to do those high intensity FIRM work outs, however, I suspect the stress on my joints would be too much. You don't have to worry about that with any of Leslie's videos. Low impact, high calorie burning! You'll love it!!",1056758400,6,970,4.192513368983957
1835545,5,B00008DDJD,"This video is ideal for aerobic activity that is not too light, not too heavy, and keeps you at just the right heart rate. Besides boosting your energy, it has so many benefits, such as weight loss, strength, being able to eat without calculating everything I eat...!! Tae Bo was giving me sciatica pains (and I'm barely 30), and I wasn't pushing myself enough when I was walking at my own leisure. This tape will give you some structure without overdoing it. I feel like someone's taking a pencil and erasing those little cellulite dents off my legs (especially since I follow it with the Firm-Up Fast video). However, it's not just about the physical effects. The camaraderie between Leslie's fellow 20-70-year-old walkers is enough to inspire and motivate. In fact, they look like people (my mom and) I would be friends with in real life. Leslie and her friends are truly human. Anyway, I FEEL LIKE A BIGGER PERSON MENTALLY AND SMALLER PHYSICALLY! THANKS, LESLIE SANSONE & FRIENDS!!",1056499200,4,985,4.834319526627219
1835546,5,B00008DDJD,"I have been doing the WATP workouts every day for about 6 months and am very comfortable with the 3 mile tapes, so I was excited to find the 4 mile super challenge, and a challenge it is!  I also have a couple of her other 4 mile tapes and while they are a good workout, they don't compare to the super challenge.
You start out easily enough with the familiar warmup from her other videos, but once you're past that, be ready for a high-stepping, pulse-pounding walk in your living room!  Once you get to the peak rate, you'll remain there for over a mile - by the time you're finished,  you'll know you'be been burning off that fat.  The music is great, very motivating, and she has incorporated a more involved stretching routine at the end that I really enjoyed.  Highly recommended tape for anyone looking to push themselves a little further in a low impact workout.",1055980800,257,870,4.446540880503145
1835547,5,B00008DDJD,"While I enjoy working out at the gym on the cardio equipment, there are some days where I just don't have time to drive there and back *and* have time to workout. This DVD is a great alternative!! Not only that but it helps to include variety each week, rather than doing the same routine all the time. Having been introduced to an older video in the Leslie Sansone series, I was excited by the fresh music and the new look. The great thing about this program is the versatility-any fitness level can do it! You can increase or decrease the intensity based on your own comfort level. You can also choose to work up to 4 miles, doing only a mile or two. When I first heard about it I thought, ""why would I want to walk in place??"" That's what I pictured...but walking is really only part of it. You do walk in place, but you also walk forward and back (if you have the space), sidesteps, little kicks, knee lifts, and arm movements. This is a great way to get started on a workout program (and you can continue it as you increase your fitness level)...you can workout at your own pace, in the comfort and privacy of your own home, no matter what the weather or your time constraints. With this video there is NO excuse not to exercise regularly!!",1055980800,36,1245,4.3247863247863245
1835548,5,B00008DDJD,"I've been using Leslie's workout videos for years and I believe the 4 mile super challenge is her best so far.  If you're just starting to exercise again or you're out of shape you might want to start with mile 1 or 2 but if you feel that you need a bigger challenge, that is fun and very motivating, mile 4 super challenge is for you.  The music helps you keep a fast pace, Leslie's postive attidude keeps you from wanting to quit, and the exercises throughout the program are so simple that anyone with two left feet can do them.  I own several of the Walk Away the Pounds videos because I can mix and match the different miles and create my own exercise program.  These are wonerful videos and anyone who wants a workout that is challenging but easy to follow should try them in a heartbeat.",1055894400,12,794,4.308724832214765
1835549,5,B00008DDJD,I just purchased this tape and I have to say I absolutely love it.  It is one of those tapes that you can either do one mile or up to the entire four.

Very easy workout but when you are done...you definately feel like you accomplished a great workout!!!!!,1055721600,2,363,4.231884057971015
