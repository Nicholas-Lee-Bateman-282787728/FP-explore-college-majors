1979072,2,B0001907BW,"This DVD is a case of false advertising. Even if you disregard the promotional hype that the Second Season Edition contains ""Outtakes"" and ""Commentaries"", the cover of the box set proclaims it is ""Loaded With Extras"". It is loaded all right, but not with extras. It is loaded with mistakes and printing errors. And no ""Commentaries"" or ""Outtakes"". There is no excuse for a DVD Video company to be so careless with their product. Indexes and menus are intended to help the viewers navigate the programs, not hinder them. Criticism aside, I bought this box set because I am a fan of the show. The episodes are funny and entertaining, even if the final product is not. Shame on NBC Home Entertainment. You are a disappointment.",1081728000,14,724,4.753968253968254
1979073,5,B0001907BW,"The second season is brilliant once I watch one episode I want to watch another straight away. I hadnt really seen the second series and was not let down by it. I was let down by the extra features, there isn't as much as season one cause it is just themed featurettes. People who are getting the dvd mainly  to see the extra features ,dont get it. Season two is brilliant and anyone who likes will and grace should definetily(?) get it.",1081382400,2,437,4.329268292682927
1979074,4,B0001907BW,"The episodes are classic.(...)  Many events happen in season two:  Grace moves out of Will's apartment (across the hall).  Jack moves in with Karen & Rosario.  Will loses his job, but finds another.  I won't list synopses of episodes, because a more diligent fan has listed them below.  This DVD is worth the excellent price on Amazon.  It's simply hilarious and makes good weekend watching.  However, there are a few problems with the DVD.  As for special features, there are no commentaries and no bloopers, only the themed featurettes which include scenes from the episodes.  The featurettes are indeed funny, but when you've seen all the episodes, they lose their luster.  The DVD box list of episodes is wrong - the first episodes of discs 2, 3, and 4 are actually the last episodes on discs 1, 2, and 3.  And on disc 4, the episodes are out of order (they appear to be backward).  This isn't that big of a deal, as you can watch them in order if you choose, but I was surprised when I pressed ""Play all"" to find that the last episode was first (I hope that makes sense).  You'd think that NBC or Lions Gate would have found those mistakes before releasing the DVD.
Let's face it - we buy these DVDs for the convenience of watching episodes whenever we choose.  I would have enjoyed bloopers, interviews, and commentaries, but Will & Grace shines on it's own.  The episodes are 5-star, but the DVD itself is only 3 (because of the mix-ups and the lack of bloopers and commentaries which I was led to believe would be on this set).  If you're a of fan high-brow (and low-brow) comedy, buy this DVD.  I've rarely laughed harder.",1080518400,10,1631,4.527397260273973
1979075,5,B0001907BW,"Will and Grace is one of the best comdies to hit television in a  very long time.  The antics, chemistry and timing between Eric McCormick, Debra Messing, Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes is outstanding!  This second season is just the beginning of many more funny times to come.  It truly shows all their talent and how Emmy winning deserving they all are...not to mention all the writers and director.  My only disappointment was that there are again no outtakes like with the season one DVD release.  That would add so much to this already great DVD collection.  Hopefully they will be on season three...and four...and five...
ANd a P.S....I am not sure if this was intentional but on disc four the episodes are not in order of how they occured on television.  They are backwards.  Ooops!",1080432000,9,788,4.735294117647059
1979076,5,B0001907BW,"One of the best-written TV shows ever is now available on DVD!
From the creators of ""Friends"" comes a series about Will Truman & Grace Adler. Two best friends, two people who share the same past and who are perfect for each other. The twist in our story is that Will is gay and Grace is straight.
So when Grace  asks Will if he agrees with her decision to marry her boyfriend Danny, and he says no, begins a story that has made us laugh for over 5 years now.
Will and Grace live in New York, and as well as their best friends. Jack , a flamboyant gay man who changes men like shirts, considers himself a ""showman"" and lives with money Will and his mother. And of course, my personal favorite character, Karen, a spoiled and lazy rich and glamorous woman,with drinking and other kind of ddiction problems who always comments on Grace's clothing choices, ""works"" for Grace, although as Grace comments "" Karen would prefer to chew her own foot than do an honest days work"".
 In season 2, we have Grace moving out from Will's apartment to the one next door,Jack producing his new show ""Jack 2000"", and Karen as always, doing her usual stuff.
Jack has moved to Karen's apartment since in the end of the previous season he married her housekeeper and close ""friend"", Rosario.
I wouldn't wanna reveal more, 'cause one picture is like a thousand words.

1979077,5,B0001907BW,"this is such a great show that i could rave about it forever but i won't for time reasons.  this season is really a standout season and is the season where sean hayes and megan mullaly and the show won their emmy's and all well deserved for that matter.  the highlights of the season are many but here are just a few of my favorites.  the water bra episode is one of the funniest ever done.  i like the part in the apartment where all three of them are feeling each other up, and then the part where grace and karen go shopping for the actual water bra.  then the part where the bra is punctured by karens broach.  there is also a funny side story where jack discovers that will once had a fling with one of his old boyfriends.  another episode has jack and rosario having to go in front of the ins people and prove they are really a couple, only to find out that jack had a fling with the ins guy, while will and grace are forced into a situation with grace's mom and her famous fix ups, except this time the fix up is for will.  one of the funniest scenes ever between karen and grace comes in the episode where karen is put on a budget by stan.  grace tries to help karen but karen won't listen and then grace holds one of her clothes hostage with some scissors.  she threatens the label then to here karen say, ""no honey that is the best part.""  when karen still refuses to listen grace tells karen that the blouse is her size and that she will go and try it on draws a scream from karen, utterly hilarious.  another great episode has grace discovering that karen once did a fetish film.  and to see her reaction is priceless.  my favorite line is ""whats hapeening, whats going on here why aren't you licking that floor?""  then there is the classic thanksgiving episode where jack comes out to his mom, how she doesnt he is gay is beyond me.  i especially like the lie he told her about how grace was his girlfriend, and then karen decides to add to the lie and say that jack cheated on grace with her.  another episode has will trying to land karen as a client in his new law firm, he is so desperate that karen makes him do a little michelle pfeifer on a piano while singing an olivia newton john song.  while grace and jack go to antiques on the road so grace can do ""the face"" and jack can hook up with the cute appraiser porcelain paul.  my last favorite has grace and molly shannon, as the crazy val, bondind and then having another one of their hilarious fights.  on the other hand jack and karen attend a meeting of ex-gays because jack has a crush on one of the reformed gays, and goes in an attempt to get with him.  so the two of them both pose as ex-gays and i love the part where karen says something funny and say listen to me im a funny lesbian then raises her hand and says ""i'm ellen"" pure genius and gives ellen a great shout out.  there are so many more episodes to talk about, but those are some of the best.  go and buy this season, it is well worth the money and you will laugh unendingly.",1079568000,7,3015,4.151462994836489
1979078,5,B0001907BW,"In my opinion, Will & Grace was at their best in Season 2.  Every one of these episodes were some of the best sitcom writing in years.  W&G earned a 'Best Comedy' Emmy from this season, as did Sean and Megan for supporting roles.  Season 2 offers some of my all-time favorite episodes.  Who can forgot 'Das Boob' when a picture in a newspaper makes Grace's chest appear much larger than they are - with the hilarious scene of Grace, Jack, and Will feeling each other up.  'To Serve and Disinfect' is awesome!!  Grace finds out Karen was in an adult fetish film and has some fun getting her back for all the mean put-downs Karen has thrown at her.  Also, Will works for Jack as a waiter serving lawyers.  This is one of the best episodes ever!!  'Homo for the Holidays' is outrageous!  Jack 'comes out' to his mother (as Karen says, ""What is she, headless?"") - a very well-written, socially responsible, yet so damn funny episode.  'The Hospital Show' where Stan is in the hospital and the gang all bet which one of them Karen will cry to first.  Karen finds out about the bet and has some fun with them.  'An Affair to Remember' features Rob & Ellen making wedding plans and later Ellen finds out that Grace slept with Rob.  So, to get back at him, she tries to sleep with Will - who can forgot her shaking her bra-laden boobies at Will saying, ""Get a load of these torpedoes!""  ""Girls, Interrupted"" was the most controversial episode of the season and ultimately one of the best.  Jack falls in love with a guy who's trying to get him 'back on the straight and narrow'.  So Karen and Jack attend one of his church-based meetings (turning gay people straight) only to expose everyone as attending a 'gay pick-up joint'.  I for one thought this was very brave writing and it is down-right funny.
I guess I could go on and on, but if you really want to see the best episodes of Will & Grace, you have to buy Season 2.  It is without a doubt one of the finest sitcom seasons in television history.  You definitely won't be disappointed!",1079049600,29,2033,4.399463806970509
1979079,5,B0001907BW,This is the series that i love and the season is one of the most cool season in all the Will & Grace show....I'm see it always...from 1998. I'm a 100% fan.,1078444800,5,155,3.875
1979080,5,B0001907BW,"""Will And Grace"" is one of the most hilarious shows on television.  This second season edition is only one way it displays that.  Those who thought season one was great are in for a thrill ride.  The jokes are funnier, the lifestyles are more flamboyant, the characters are more ""in-your-face"", and many more.  The writers prove that they know how to prolong audiences' enjoyment through their work.  Their brilliant work will go down in history.  Before the show began, only ""Ellen"", which starred Ellen DeGeneres, explored gay issues to this magnitude.  Such daring attempts deserve the ""Will And Grace"" cast and crew tremendous respect.  This brings the GLBT rights movement closer to success by letting audiences know that this is out there, and they must get over their hatred.
""Will And Grace"" stars Debra Messing, Eric McCormick, Sean Hayes, and Megan Mullally.  This season saw the introduction of Shelley Morrison, Rosario, in the cast.  Every actor offers their own sense of humor into every episode.  Every episode shows many surprises from the actors, especially their behavior.  They never have a dull moment.  The guest celebrity stars offer added enjoyment to the show: Gregory Hines, Veronica Cartright, Neil Patrick Harris, Joan Collins, and more.
Those who didn't watch the second season of ""Will And Grace"" when it originally aired (1999-2000) will get to see Will and Grace's struggle to find love while still living together, Karen still mourning her husband being lock up in prison, and of course, Jack being Jack.  This DVD set is one way to discover how the characters come to be who they are now.  Those who watched the show in its second season will also find enjoyment.  Regardless how many times each episode is watched, it never gets dull.  Those who love this collection should also buy the first season.  Such combination makes a hilarious experience.",1078272000,2,1882,5.016129032258065

Some how long episodes are split into two and are missing footage!
Some episodes are 16x9 and others are 4x3.
What a mess! Don't bother. Even the DVDs are better than these.

The two-part division was made for later syndicated reruns. More importantly, substantial cuts were also made, totalling three missing minutes. As I read on this site, this shameful situation is the same in all of Seasons 5 and 6 (probably 7 and 8 as well), where the cut, syndicated versions are used--the same ones people can see for free in daily TV reruns.

The only reason Grace keeps Karen around is for her leads and connections in the greater New York metropolitan area.  We also are introducted to Ben Deucett (the late, great Gregory Hines--yes, the same one best known for tap dancing into our hearts in films like TAP), crafty boss of lawyer Will Truman (Eric McCormack). We also have the great pleasure of seeing Debbie Reynolds, as Bobbie Adler, Grace's mother.  Reynolds totally hams it up on the program, and sends up her image as a big, on-screen musical theater diva.  The laughs come fast and furiously.  Of course, many of the greatest and biggest laughs are prompted by the antics of would-be song and dance man Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes), Will's best friend.

1979332,5,B0001907BW,"Season 2 is probably the best season of the show which incidentally the season where the show won an Emmy for Outstanding Series. The show has one of the wackiest ensembles in TV with Sean Hayes and Megan Mullaly often stealing the show. But big credit should also be given to Debra Messing and Eric Mccormack who both provided some sense of reality to the over the top and larger than life characters that populate the show. I don't think Hayes and Mullaly wouldn't be as effective if not for Messing and Mccormack (jokes poking fun at will and Grace). And besides Karen and Jack may be the comedic core of the show, but the heart and soul of the show are Will and Grace.

Some of the best episodes of the second season are:

-Guess Who's Not Coming to Dinner

-Das Boob (a great episode for Messing)

-To Serve and Disinfect (Mullaly stole the show and she had a great moment with Grace when she was hurt by the porn jokes)

-Homo for the holidays (one of the best episodes of the series, great ensemble episode)

-Hey La, Hey La, My Ex-boyfriend's Back (watch out for Mullaly's very funny scenes as she tried to design a chair)

-The Hospital Show

-Sweet and Sour Shoe

-He's Come Undone

1979334,5,B0001907BW,"Premiering in the Fall of 1998, Will & Grace has become one of the most celebrated shows of its time. Nominated for 49 Emmys, and winner of 12 (including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2000), the show follows the lives of two best friends who live together. With a plethora of other award nominations - 24 Golden Globes, 14 SAG Awards, and 6 People's Choice Awards, Will & Grace continues to light up the small screen with its unique brand of comic humor and groundbreaking sitcom format...

Debra Messing stars in the role of Grace Adler, a straight interior designer who moves into an apartment with her best friend Will (Eric McCormack). Friends since college, Will is a successful lawyer who also happens to be gay (thus, keeping their relationship from becoming a permanent romantic one). Having dated before Will came out of the closet, the two maintain a more intimate relationship than mere casual friends. The comic sequences involving the two are complimented by Will's flamboyantly gay friend Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes) and Grace's sarcastic, alcoholic assistant Karen Walker (Megan Mullally)...

The Will & Grace (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Guess Who's Not Coming to Dinner?"" in which Grace, having moved into the apartment across the hall, is nonetheless still reliant on Will for support. To prove to Will that she's not clingy, she throws a dinner party and refuses to invite him. Meanwhile, Jack moves in with Rosario in order to keep the government from deporting him... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""To Serve & Disinfect"" in which a newly unemployed Will agrees to work as a waiter for Jack's catering business only to end up working an American Bar Association function, and ""Advise & Resent"" in which Will is set up on a blind date by his boss (and Jack gives him some timely advice)...

When I say that WILL & GRACE is a lame sitcom, you should see the way some people react.  I'm not saying it doesn't have a right to exist, that the cause of civil rights needs to beaten down to the ground, that internment camps should be built.  I'm just saying that this show is NOT FUNNY.

I just hope they have it where I can watch it in Spanish like Season 1!",1092873600,4,564,3.955357142857143
1979339,5,B0001907BW,"Just as the majority of us have grown up channel surfing only to have seen ""I Love Lucy"" run, re-run and re-re-run, and laughing-out-loud every time as if it were our first experience, ""Will And Grace"" now replaces that ground-breaking and pioneering sitcom we will grow old watching over and over with adoring anticipation.
With Grace (Debra Messing) seducing us with her sexy, and often ""hands-on"" comedic displays, Will's (Eric McCormack) reactive facial expressions and quick-to-the-punch retorts, Jack's (Sean Hayes) endearing honesty coupled with his hilarious ability to shine and Karen's (Megan Mullally) irrepressive and fly-by-the-seat-of-her-pants knack of incredibly funny yet critical one-liners, ""Will And Grace"" takes the top spot for small-screen comedy entertainment.
It really doesn't matter whether you're gay, straight or somewhere in between. ""Will And Grace"" never stays on one side of the tracks for very long and provides equal comedic relief to every sexually orientated niche doing it with style, impeccable comedic timing and knee-slapping hilarity.
For anyone who's ever wanted for quality sitcomic entertainment with an adoring cast and situations that will have you laughing every time you watch, ""Will And Grace"" is your all-around best bet and the best yet since the yelpings of ""Babaloo!""",1089590400,3,1321,5.577114427860696
1979360,3,B0001907BW,"Will and Grace is sssooo extrememly boring!  Th only funny person on the show is Jack.  If you are interested in some REAL comedy, buy any one of the ""Friends"" seasons on DvD.",1088726400,2,175,4.2727272727272725
1979361,5,B0001907BW,"This is my all time favourite sitcom. So...I decide to see if Amazon.com advertises its release in America. YES!!!! Series One & Two on DVD. Finally....they arrive in Sydney and so..I start watching a series I've always adored (but never experienced), from the beginning...so to speak.
There's only one word......WOW.....
There must be buckets of people, beyond me, who have not seen W&G from the very beginning. For everyone with a passion for 'Friends' - I can now understand why 'W&G' has survived, because I'm finally blessed to be able to see this iconic series from Day One - including the pilot. I always wanted to know how 'W&G' atarted and this DVD set plugs every hole & does not disappoint. The packaging from America is as good as one would expect - in other words....excellent.
Whether the show has deteriorated or not over the following several years from this wonderful beginning is immaterial. This box set...and Season Two...are MUST HAVES in any serious DVD collection. Flick your head, change the station, do whatever....who hasn't watched Will & Grace? But to revisit it from the very beginning though....well, I've already written about that.

What IS also material is that if one goes the United Kingdom Amazon.com website, one will find that they're already releasing Seasons Three & Four.
(OK..with different start-dates, to be sure...[ones which do not correspond with 1998/1999...when the show surfaced in the USA]... but never the less, what is going on?) It can't be right that an iconic American sitcom that I love (and will do, 'til I die), is being pumped out on DVD in England, before it hits the streets in Manhattan.",1085184000,10,1650,4.956678700361011
1979362,4,B0001907BW,"I would find it hard to believe that whoever was primarily responsible for assembling the package design for this DVD set still has his or her job.  Sloppy.  Just sloppy.
The disc contents info listings are inaccurate, some of the shows are out of order (the 2-part finale leads off disc 4 instead of concluding it), an episode listed for one disc actually appears on another, etc.
I thought we were supposed to be dealing with reasonably intelligent professional folks at these studios!  I'm sure many of them are doing their jobs well and accurately, but when goofs like this make it to the product when it hits the street it just makes everyone involved look incompetent.  Perhaps some of these mindless offenders are in a union and have protected jobs.  No motivation for excellence.  Perhaps.  Oh well.  End of rant.
And now, the content itself:
Season 2 is arguably funnier than season 1.  That is a tribute to the writers and the producers -- they found ways to keep the show fresh when the show could have so easily been stuck in a repetitive rut, repeating the same gay jokes over and over and over.
The ""themed featurettes"" are once again disappointing.  All they are are 3-minute collections of show clips and punchlines.  Not exactly value-added material, y'know.
Suggestion for Season 3's box set:  find someone with half a brain to personally see the development and production process through from start to finish.  Establish some direct accountability in the hopes of preventing the stupid, preventable design and chronology errors that made the Season 2 set look so unimpressive.  Heck, if they will pay me enough I will come do it myself.  Start to finish - initial concept to street release.  How much are the current folks getting paid for this, anyway?  Too much, apparently.
Advance warning to the production company and studio:  Many of us will be deliberately searching for similar goofs when Season 3 comes out later.  Save yourselves some embarrassment and do your jobs right.  The top man or woman on the totem pole is just as responsible as the line employees at every step along the process.  Sloppy output and inefficiency = lack of respect for the consumer.
Surely it should bother the DVD production staff that the lasting impression the consumers have of the Season 2 set is ""Great show, but the production staff is borderline incompetent"".  Try shaking off that image, guys and gals.
It's just more proof that ""the world is run by C students"".  (-Anonymous)",1083369600,44,2491,4.836879432624113
1979363,5,B0001907BW,"The content of this 4 DVD package is without question, some of the funniest, and superb comedy ever seen on television.. and nearly everyone agrees this is a treasure box. YES, the content is out of order, and perhaps there are some factual errors on the box...... BUT... I must say, as a graphic designer, the actual DESIGN and PACKAGING of this set is very beautiful and, like SEASON 1, was beautifully laid out with a thoughtful presentation.  I CANNOT give this set bad marks for content or appearance... and the blunders on the info and show order still does not pull down the plusses. This is a MUST have for any good collector of terrific television and tasteful side-splitting comedy and the PICTURE, COLOR, SOUND, and QUALITY in reproduction is first rate.

1979364,3,B0001907BW,"Will and Grace's second season is even better than the first, although I still don't think it's at its best, but the whole season shows promise as it rolls along to its finale...

...speaking of, as other reviewers have mentioned, the episodes (on the last disc) are completely out of order--you need to use the episode guide in the booklet in order to avoid confusion.  I'm surprised that NBC let such a mix-up slip by, especially for one of their highest-rated shows (I could understand if the episodes were backwards, but they are completely shuffled around randomly).  Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until I'd watched all the DVDs, and remained confused about what had happened after the ""final"" episode.  I realize this may not be that big a deal to most people, but this really bothered me and took a little bit away from the last couple of episodes since I wasn't so much focused on the humor, but trying to put illogical pieces together.

The extras are also skimpy (same kind of featurettes as the previous season's DVD, and no interviews this time), but at least all the episodes are there... in some order.

I just hope NBC wakes up when making the next season's DVDs...",1082332800,36,1187,4.7101449275362315
1979365,3,B0001907BW,"Let me first say that I am a huge Will & Grace fan and will explain why I rated this DVD with only 3 stars. If you are interested in viewing hilarious and brilliantly written comedy episodes, then Season 2 will be a great purchase and will not disappoint. I, however, always look at the DVD extras. Will & Grace Season 2, as was the case with Season 1, could have really been ""loaded with extra features"" but, once again, this DVD is lacking. In fact, it's worse than the extra features in Season 1. On this DVD, there are themed featurettes on each disc which are truly well done. But, why are there no interviews with the cast, the producer, the director? Why aren't there any outtake featurettes? I'm sure we ALL would have loved to see bloopers by Will, Grace, Jack, Karen and even Rosario. There must have been tons on the cutting room floor. Even humorous mistakes (which I'm sure there were) by guest stars would have been fun to include too. As cleverly put together as the themed featurettes are, having only them on each disc is a bit redundant.
Also, I did notice that the listings on the jacket describing the contents of the discs is inaccurate. For example, according to the jacket, the themed featurettes are supposed to only be on disc 3, but, in fact, they're on each of the 4 discs. As well, disc 4's episodes do not follow in cronological order. In other words, the season finale is the very first episode on the disc. What's that all about?
I'm not impressed at all with the production of this DVD and you will not be either. I only hope they'll learn from Season 2 because they obviously didn't from Season 1. Perhaps Season 3 will be so incredibly ""loaded with extra features"" we'll forgive them and forget about this one. Go ahead and purchase Will & Grace Season 2 for it's sidesplitting comedy, but if you're looking for the ""loaded with extra features"" you won't find it here...trust me.",1082246400,15,1913,4.5

Others have been complaining about the fact that some episodes are out of order, and that is true.  However, this is still an outstanding set with a wonderful value.  You'll be a little confused at first about the fact that, due to the mix-up, Will magically teleports from the Caribbean island to New York, but that's a very small detail.

The second season is hilarious.  This season starts off with Jack married to Rosario(Karen's maid) and ends with Will running away to the islands.  It's just hard to say which show out of this package is the best.  If I had to, it would probably be Jack coming out to his mom.  ""Girl Interuppted"" is another hilight when Molly Shannon is back as Val.  The themed features are also funny.  The only thing that is not here are bloopers.  Buy this set.
