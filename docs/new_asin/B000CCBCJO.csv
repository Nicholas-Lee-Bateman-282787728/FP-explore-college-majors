2455738,5,B000CCBCJO,"Many people may say that Nick Cannon is someone that you wouldn't consider to be really all that talented, considering that his last few movies and music albums haven't really set the big screen or the airwaves on fire.  However, if there is one particular realm that Cannon may have found his niche in, it's the world of comedy.  Improv comedy, that is.  MTV wanted to test this out by creating Wild 'N Out, and the results gave the network high ratings and a 2nd season of the series (currently in progress).

Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out is a sketch comedy show that plays like a more urbanized version of ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"", with 2 teams of comedians (Red Squad, led normally by Cannon, and the Black Squad, led by a celebrity guest) facing off in a series of games that showcase the comedy skills.  Each game culminates in a final round called WildStyle where the teams face off in a freestyle rapping competition similar to 8 Mile.  The teams earn points for the main games but in WildStyle each punchline can score 1 individual point towards the final team score.

Wild 'N Out-Season One is a 3 disc set which contains the first 10 episodes of the series (Episodes 1-5 are on Disc 1 while 6-10 are on Disc 2) and features Cannon taking on Orlando Jones (Cannon's co-star from Drumline), Christina Milian (Cannon's now-former girlfriend), Method Man, Omarion, Kanye West, Eva Pigford (America's Next Top Model Cycle 3 winner), and more.

Each episode contains extra extended games that didn't get to air on the show, bonus sketches and more.  The 3rd disc is full of special features including more bonus games, extended games, bloopers, best of WildStyle (If you watch the Kanye West episode, in which he pretty much decimates Red Squad, the best of WildStyle segment is required viewing as it contains an extended version and it is CLASSIC since Kanye REALLY unleashes on Red Squad!) and a video featuring the sexy Wild 'N Out Girls.

While the disc set is uncensored there are some things that are still censored out even though it is on DVD, but that doesn't take away from the uproarious humor Nick and the crew bring.

So if you want to get a little Wild and laugh, get Wild 'N Out...",1141862400,4,2209,4.60969387755102
2455739,4,B000CCBCJO,"I loved this show when it was on and since leaving the states to serve a tour here in Germany, I went into a movie store here and saw that this was out. I rented it and the two discs of shows took only a couple of hours and the extras are not really that great. They are skits that nobody laugh at when they were taping so they cut them. I love this show but on dvd it is way to short and you will find out when you get the dvd.",1141516800,2,428,3.6129032258064515

2455741,5,B000CCBCJO,"This show gets 5 stars for the skit Judge Mo Dollars alone. Each one lasts about 3-5 minutes but it is possibly one of the funniest things I had seen on television.

As a whole the show is quite good especially the freestyle battles at the end of the show which have a tendency to get nasty.",1140480000,,291,4.105263157894737
2455742,5,B000CCBCJO,"This is by far the best show I've seen from all of last year. It's very funny too. I love the contests that they have, the things they have the contestants do are absolutely hillarious. And this is certainly a lot better than that absoltuely dreadful Andy Milonakis show. This is a major come back for MTV.",1139097600,,306,4.385964912280702
2455743,4,B000CCBCJO,"If you are into hillarious improtu comedy you will love this show. I was a skeptic at first because it was Nick Cannon but after I saw one episode my mind was soon changed. The guest on the shows are brilliant, especially the Ying Yang Twins and Kanye West. No one is spared. Not even Cannon himself. I suggest this DVD to anyone who enjoys laughing.",1139097600,2,350,4.318181818181818
2455774,5,B000CCBCJO,This show is really funny. I would recommend this show to anyone who wants to have a good laugh. People with good sense of humor will really like this show. The show can be watched live.,1150416000,2,186,4.194444444444445
2455775,3,B000CCBCJO,"I know it's been a common complaint among users, but yeah it bugged me enough to put out my two cents in. When i purchased the DVD box, i expected UNCENSORED performances. Since the vast majority of the comedy is verbal, it's upsetting when you don't know what the comedians are saying with their punch-lines being bleeped out. It leaves you trying to figure out the missing lines which COMPLETELY defeats the purpose of watching improv comedy.

Moreover, the missing musical acts takes alot away from the show, too. As soon as the final act/game is over, it cuts out leaving the showing feeling like it's been rushed toward completion. On top of that, i'd really really like to SEE some of these acts (ie. T.I., Cassidy) so why the HECK not?!

To sum things up.. it was a GREAT watch. Some really funny stuff, and decent extras... but why not get the WHOLE deal when you pay the price for just that? In the end... i still feel deceived and ripped off.

Boo nick cannon. Boo.",1144713600,11,975,4.497175141242938
2455776,4,B000CCBCJO,"Wild and out is illest improv comedy from downtown L.A.'s top of the charts. It is recommended. Now if you want to buy it for your kids, you may re-consider it. It has some racism and if you're 14 or younger you might consider watching it with your parents. OR I guess you can be mature. Sometimes people get naked too. So as an uncenscored DVD some content is not appropriate for your children. I still recommend you buying it. If you like gotham comedy, the funniest on the planet.",1143676800,,483,4.377777777777778
2455777,2,B000CCBCJO,"I love the show, I've seen all the episodes, but when I saw that the 1st season was going to be released uncensored, I was waiting for the release date.  I bought the DVD and still heard more bleeps than punch lines and the musical performances were cut out for no reason.

Sister company Comedy Central: Dave Chepelle season's all have complete musical performances.  (No copy right laws if that's what your thinking)

Biggest disappointment: Can't return DVD's.",1143417600,9,463,4.897435897435898
2455778,3,B000CCBCJO,"To start this off, I was amped up when I heard about the Season 1 DVD release, even more amped when I bought it out of FYE. but when I got home and viewed the ENTIRE set, I've got some complaints that I'm sure a lot fo fans of the show share with me.

The last time I checked, the term ""uncensored"", in it's best sense, means no bleeps. I understand that MTV has standards and practices to abide by, but keep in mind the key word: ""uncensored"".

Although it's a great watch for me, I still feel a bit ripped off. I feel, IMO, that MTV needs to take a page from it's brother/sister/cousin network, Comedy Central, because when THEY release uncensored material (i.e., Chappelle Show Seasons 1 and 2), it is UNCENSORED. MTV needs to REALLY sit back and think about this, because, if it hasn't already happened yet, someone may bring suit against them. Why? ""False advertising"".

MTV, please perform a re-call of this set, and re-release it with ABSOLUTELY NO BLEEPS!

Thank you.",1142553600,4,975,4.491525423728813

That being said, I didn't give it five stars because season 1 they were just starting out and it wasn't my favorite season, though still very funny. If you are a fan of Whose Line is It Anyway you will likely enjoy this show as well. They both have the improv that keeps things interesting.",1409875200,,349,4.384615384615385
