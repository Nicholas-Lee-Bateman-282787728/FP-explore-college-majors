8037874,1,B000637S7Y,This video was more for a person looking for choreography!! Not an excercise video in my opinion. Definitely a 'dance' video!!,1236816000,,126,5.0476190476190474
8037875,4,B000637S7Y,"I tried her other dance ""Cardio Soul"" & loved it. She broke down moves, she was chatty, but she has a great personality, a huge amount of infectious energy, great fluidity & love of dance & isn't into being perfect, so her workouts are more fun.
This is done on a large studio set w/fake urban walls & fan with wood floor. The dancers sometimes change throughout the several chaptered workout with using mostly woman & 2 guys.
After the 1 min intro, you have a 5 min warm up & then 18 min of the main dance. There were mambos, shasses? (fast 2 step), hip twist, v-step, running man, but they aren't broken down & there was a lot of step touches. It ends with an ab work w/hand weight is only 5 min, then about 3 min of some simple cardio moves & a few seconds of punching the air.
It could have had more dance, but Victoria is great here as always. Those who like easier step touches, etc. might like it more.
Delete two stars if you were looking for strictly dancing moves.

You can see a sample of her style on youtube under ""Victoria's body shoppe"" ""Cardio DAnce Training VBS Episode #5 Cardio"" & here her ideas about training women on ""Cardio Training To Burn Fat""
