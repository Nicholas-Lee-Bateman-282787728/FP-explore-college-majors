8595487,5,B00008AJBX,"As an RN, I do some consulting in nutrition.  Using the muscle testing techniques that David Getoff teaches in his video series, I believe all health care practitioners can greatly improve their ability to help their patients.  One of the things I like about David is that he has learned muscle testing from the best in the field - ALL the best, not just one.  He has been using it successfully in his private practice for many years, helping people find their way back to optimal health.  I strive to become as proficient as David so that I, too, can make such a difference in people's lives.  I also felt I got more than I paid for because of all the incredible information about nutrition and supplements on the videos.  David is an expert in his field, is passionate about sharing his knowledge with others, and is an inspiration to all who hear him.",1092614400,,854,4.512987012987013
