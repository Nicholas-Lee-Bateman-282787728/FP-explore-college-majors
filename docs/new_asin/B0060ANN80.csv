8490313,2,B0060ANN80,"I really don't remember if I was sent this 2011 film as a screener, was gag gifted it, or bought it on a whim but the DVD has been sitting in my over-sized pile of movies to watch for about 2 years so I decided to bite the bullet and sit down to watch it. After having watched it I really hope it was a screener or gift and that I didn't actually pay for it. That should give you an idea where this is going.

In this realm of a zombie apocalypse we end up finding that the zombies are caused by some kind of space virus right off the bat that comes down and starts infecting people. We see a quick idea of how it spread and fast forward to two stoners who are surviving after the apocalypse. We don't really see how they are surviving by getting their supplies but we do see how they are getting by on their own supply, or weed that is. Yes, Bong of the Dead should have given it away with the name that its a stoner zombie film. Its an idea that could have potential if it didn't seem like writer and director Thomas Newman (Lake Placid) was stoned while he was creating it.

The introduction actually is catchy. Its a bit of off humor silent film styled horror that makes you think that the director may have been on to something. It was a different way to not only introduce how zombies were done but had enough of a different approach that I got my hopes up about the film. That was a mistake. Im not sure if it was genius or fluke but all of the good will the film bought was spent right after that.

Edwin and Tommy are the two heroes of the film though in all honestly all they want to do is chase their next high. What we find out that makes them have to go and deal with more zombies is that apparently the brains of the undead make for some killer fertilizer for weed. (Yes, because THAT sounds like a good idea to try out.) With their stash getting low they must run to the danger zone in order to track down more of the undead and grab a few brain filled skulls to restock.

While the thought on the twist of humans needing zombie brains is fun, getting there is painful. The dialogue is full of horribly written (and not funny) stoner jokes and a pile of what is apparently waxing poetic about the state of the world in the zombie apocalypse.

It just didn't mesh together.

The film had an almost redeeming moment when the two stoners car runs out of gas and they meet Leah as the bad ass chick whose been on her own. It worked for a full ten minutes and I again got my hopes up until she suddenly was quite smitten with the two, in her own way. I understand that she had to go along with them to move the story forward but the way they did it? Just didn't work for me.

Oh, and there is an intelligent zombie trying to build an army from the not-so-intelligent undead thats out there as well.

Now on the one hand the film had a lot of things going for it visually with the $5,000 budget it had to put it together. *I* could probably not make a movie that looked better on that budget. So I really cant knock the movie visually (and they did have a decent look for most of the undead as well.) So I cant completely tear this one apart.

So with a slow plot and a not funny script when its supposed to be a zomcom.. I just cant suggest picking this one up.

Im pretty sure I was just a LOT more fair to this movie than it deserved.",1392681600,,3346,4.056060606060606
8490314,5,B0060ANN80,"First off it's not fair for anyone to criticize this movie based on effects, storyline, or acting. The fact is if you read the credits this movie was filmed with one camera and edited on a single Mac with Pro Tools. Half of the actors are related and you'll see that most of the same guys handling multiple directing, editing, and technical roles. In fact, I would about bet this was someones college film project. The movie title says it all, it's a silly ultra low budget zombie stoner comedy about 2 dudes willing to risk their lives in order to make some killer weed out of home made zombie brain fertilizer.  The acting wasn't bad and I've seen much worse acting on other low budget zombie flicks. This movie is worth taking a look at if you are not closed minded and are into low budget zombie comedies.",1387670400,,809,4.429530201342282
8490315,2,B0060ANN80,"A zombie outbreak is caused by CG meteors. Two stoners (Jy Harris, Mark Wynn) survive and hook up with a woman (Simone Bailly). They travel to a place broadcast on the radio to be a safe zone. That's pretty much it. Plenty of stoner ""humor"". Acting is bad, the dialouge is idiotic. The plot is simple and stupid. The blood effects are mostly ""Troma"" style.

This film is supposed to be humorous, but it was just plain stupid. I had high hopes for it in the beginning, but once our Beethoven loving Hummel painter scene was over, the movie tanked.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex. Nudity (Tanzyn Ambrose, Rose Greenwood)",1366416000,,619,4.618181818181818

8490317,4,B0060ANN80,"Bong of the Dead is a stoner comedy on the order of Cheech and Chong, but with Zombies.  The special effects and gore scenes are amazing for the budget, and the characters are likeable (but often annoying).  The middle drags a little and there are far too many scenes of our heroes kicking back and partying.  That being said there were a few things I haven't seen in a movie before (especially a zombie movie) so the uniqueness of the story and situations make it a must see for Zombie fans.  Give it a watch and you won't be disappointed.  Just be aware that the movie is 70% stoner comedy and 30% zombie ....but the 30% makes it worth your time.",1337126400,3,648,4.322314049586777
