8215772,5,B000UYN9RC,This was a really wonderful journey.  I also watched INTO THE PRIDE also with Dave Salmoni  which is a great documentary to go along with this and a much more dangerous assignment.  He is sensational and really loves his work and puts his life on the line for what he believes in.  Time goes really fast when you watch this.  A must for lion lovers.,1444435200,,349,4.3076923076923075
8215773,4,B000UYN9RC,"This is an entertaining documentary/reality type show where a man goes out into the wild or semi-wild and engages a fully grown adult lion.  It takes guts to do that, obviously.  You have to be a bit crazy as well.  Yet, it takes people of daring bravery to help us understand these marvelous creatures better so we can preserve their species... before it's too late.

This documentary is well made, if a little predictable.  He doesn't get eaten or anything.....  I hope that doesn't come across as a spoiler...  LOL.

If you like Lions and related documentaries, you will no doubt enjoy this one too.  When I bought it, the price was certainly right.  When the quality is this good and the price is cheap, you just can't miss with it. I seem to recall a second feature as a bonus on the disc as well.  It is also very interesting.

Happy viewing.",1344988800,,848,4.470588235294118
8215774,1,B000UYN9RC,"I am giving this piece of trash 0 star.

Dave Salmoni is not a ""zoologist"". This clown is by profession a CIRCUS ANIMAL TRAINER.

In this show, (which I could not sit through for more than 15 minutes), Salmoni leaves the comfort and travesty of a circus (comprised of some endangered species) at Bowmanville Zoo, Ontario, Canada, to visit a private ""luxury game reserve"" named Thornybush, owned by a bunch of Caucasians in South Africa.

In a pathetic attempt to prove what little masculinity that he may possess, he harasses the lions in the game reserve by yelling at them and approaching them on foot. Both of these actions violate the protocols of the game reserve, but are made by the show to seem like acts of ""bravery"".

This show is an absolutely ridiculous and despicable attempt by a circus animal trainer to ""condition"" some wild lions of South Africa into the only ""wild animals"" he knew -- circus animals. The narrations are blatant, sensational, and fallacious. Discovery Channel has stooped to a very low level indeed, to be endorsing such tripe. Discovery Channel and Animal Planet might as well be showing Jersey Shore from now on.",1320537600,2,1148,4.812182741116751
8215775,4,B000UYN9RC,"I saw this one on tv, and ever since, we've been calling our cat the big lion. The animal guy has a canadian accent, and they way he talks is quite amusing. There are some amazing scenes where he plays with a baby lion and chills out right next to a family of lions.",1274313600,,266,3.9444444444444446
8215776,3,B000UYN9RC,"If you want to buy this DVD for the ""Into the Lion's Den"" only that's fine, but if you expect to see the ""Living with Tigers"" in its integrity you will be disappointed. The ""Living with Tigers"" shown here is not the entire program which it's about 1 hour and 38 minutes, but a short version of it with several scenes cut off the film. If you want to buy ""Living with Tigers"" go to the Discovery Channel site and get it there.",1265414400,9,425,4.132530120481928
