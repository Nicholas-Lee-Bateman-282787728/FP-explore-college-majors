 I just finished a Hours Long Marathon of Stratos 4, and I just would like to pass my impression here.

 At first I just bought the series for I liked the artwork and songs, but I was not that sure about the story itself, and the TV here in Brasil is showing one ep per week, wich is very slow indeed (I saw up to the 3rd when decided to buy the series).

 Well, after watching the first known ones and going to the unknown ones to me, I got engrossed in the plot, and just went all the way to the end, and I need to say, buy this series. The artwork is very beautifull, the songs are first rate, and the story has an interesting twist at the end, wich I will not tell to not spoil the fun.

 Of course the end, although happy, leaves a taste of ""so what..."" and should have being extended, up to 26 eps at least, for the story peaks up by the 10 ep, meaning, at the very end, making things rushed.

 But this is a very good anime.

 And one extra here...The artwork reminds me a lot Studio Gonzo style (Gourgeous to the very last minute/scene) but nothing is said about it at least where I was able to understand...But then, on one scene, on ""Go Gate"" you will see two very interesting guests: Meia and Dita from Vandread!!!No mistakes here...They were on Shimoji Island, and having fun... a cute crossover here, and a strong telltale that this anime has something indeed to do with Studio Gonzo...

 I bought the asian Complete Box Series, but I advise you to buy the american release, as the legends are not that good, and the image is not par up with a domestic DVD....

  Best Regards

8217833,4,B00020HC04,"In the future, the survival of mankind is threatened by a swarm of travelling meteorites which could destroy civilization as we know it. Knowing about this 50 years ahead of time, the nations of the Earth make plans to stop the meteorites from reaching the surface of the planet. The first line of defense in orbit is an elite corps of pilots known as the Comet Blasters. Their job is to shatter the meteorites into pieces small enough to burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere. Just in case some pieces make it through, another line of protection is called upon. Jets are lauched to the edge of space piloted by the Meteor Sweepers to take out any fragments. There also have to be backups of the main pilots just in case of emergency. That's where our four heroines step into the picture. They are back up Meteor Sweepers.

 Shizuha, Ayamo, Karin, and Mikaze's characters aren't really formed a whole lot in this first volume. Mikaze seems to have the most angst and most screentime. She comes from a family of pilots and has been held up to a higher standard than the other girls. It's like she always pushed into being a pilot so now she's wondering what SHE wants to do with her life. The problem is that while she's distracted and inattentive during training, her lack of enthusiasm might cause someone to lose their life. Ayamo is the titular wanna-be leader of the group and is dedicated to getting into space and being a Comet Blaster. Needless to say, she has a lot of frustration about Mikaze's failure to live up to her potential. Shizuha, for now just seems like a Yes-woman for Ayamo who doesn't have a very strong will. Lastly, Karin spends most of her time sending text messages on her cell-phone. She seems intelligent, but a little lackadaisical in normal life. Good thing that she's all business in the cockpit.

 The first volume is mainly just the setup for the rest of the series. It follows the girl's daily lives as they step up from being observers of others risking their lives to the girls in full participation defending the Earth from a deadly threat. There's lots of humor and shades of fan service and some great adventure here. The question is whether or not the girls can mature enough mentally to handle the danger of their duty. Nevermind why only young boys and girls could fill these roles. This is an anime.

 Highly recommended. I didn't think it was going to be a good series at first, but as I got to know the characters, I became more involved and now I think it's great.

 Great music here too, from pop songs to orchestral, and the art is first-rate.

 There's a couple of nice extras on the dvd, including a video segment as two of the Japanese voice actresses, the director, and character designer spend a day sightseeing the real Shimoji Island, the location of the Stratos 4 base. There is also an amusing segment where a slightly toothless ""military commentator"" explains the real basis for the vehicles in the series. Especially enlightening is his explanation as to why the girls have to straddle their seats in the jets like a motorcycle, causing their butts to stick in the camera's lens. Also includes clean open/closes and brief bios of the English actors.
