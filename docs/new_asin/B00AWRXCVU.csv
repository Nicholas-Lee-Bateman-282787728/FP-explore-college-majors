8558549,5,B00AWRXCVU,"This 56 minute leg and cardio workout is part of Cathe's Xtrain Series.  You alternate a cardio blast with a leg exercise for 12 rounds.  Rounds 1- 6 have floor cardio and Rounds 7 - 12 have step cardio. This more of an endurance workout than a strength one because you aren't using really heavy weights.  Your heart rate will be elevated for the entire workout!

Like the other workouts in the Xtrain series, there are lots of premixes, both longer and shorter.  The bonus workouts are Core 1 and 2.  The challenge workout is Hip Thrusts.

Overall, I enjoyed this workout.  It's tough, but it didn't leave me gasping for air. At the end, I felt energized not tired.

What you'll need for this workout:

* Step with 3 risers per side
* Dumbbells; Cathe uses 15 - 25 pound dumbbells
* Dixie cups
*Firewalker band.

Why I enjoyed this workout:

* Cathe tells us what weights she is using.  While it is strongly recommended you do one rep max testing for this workout, you don't have to and can still get a good workout.  My legs are pretty strong, so I was able to use similar weights.

* No exercises are repeated, so if you don't like a particular exercise don't worry it will be over before you know it.

* The alternating cardio and leg exercises make for a nice flow.

* The stretches in between several of the rounds.  These really help me give it my all for the entire workout.

* It is very easy to modify to make it easier or harder.  You can keep the cardio all low impact and not do any jumping.  To make things harder, you can use heavier weights and jump higher.

Unfortunately, Cathe's choice of music was a real downer.  The music for the first 30 minutes was fine.  It had a driving beat and kept me energized.  At the 30 minute mark, the music changed into the awful whiney music that unfortunately seems to be Cathe's trademark.  This was a definite de-motivator for me.  It's at this point in a workout when I especially need a driving beat to keep me going.

I do recommend this workout for anyone wanting a fun and not too challenging leg and cardio workout.",1364342400,,2077,4.3524804177545695
