8395629,1,B003EU4BAS,"Bought this horrible choice unfortunately. Rank amateurish, poorly directed sham of a movie. Shouldn't be sold on Amazon! IT REALLY STINKS",1439164800,,138,5.619047619047619
8395630,3,B003EU4BAS,"It was funny, but hard to give any more stars when I missed the last 1/3 of the movie. Maybe the theatrical version moved along a little faster.",1394409600,,144,4.178571428571429
8395631,5,B003EU4BAS,"This campy movie packs in layers of clever humor and dozens of quotable quotes.  Each time you watch, you'll catch something new.  There are a few bare breasts, but it's definitely not just a ""guy"" flick; it's a great movie to watch with friends of both sexes.  The acting is generally great and very entertaining.  Put it on during your next party.  You and your friends will probably be trading quotes for the next several weeks, a la Seinfeld or Rocky Horror.",1274745600,2,462,4.585365853658536
