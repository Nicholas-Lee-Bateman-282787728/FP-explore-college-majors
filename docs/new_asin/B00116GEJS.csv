3060591,1,B00116GEJS,"I have been waiting for this, the last of the ""Lomesome Dove"" series, to make it to TV. I was hugely disapointed. I can't believe the author, Larry McMurtry, is credited with co-writing the screen play. The original ""Lonesome Dove"" was perhaps the best miniseries TV ever produced. The three follow ups, though not as good, were well done. ""Comanche Moon"" was a mess. Beinging with the poor screen play,the less then mediocre production, bad acting, ect. The camera work had the canvas of the old West to use, but I can't recall on time when they took advantage of the sceenery. The acting was just liveless. Even the little kid who played Newt look like a doll, when he should have look like a  boy. The relationship between Gus and Clara that was so real and full of feeling in the original just left me cool.
I should have known something was wrong when I saw that TV kept delaying its release. If there had not been a writters strike we may never have seen this Turkey.
I am sorry that Lonesome Dove will end like this.",1200700800,11,1023,4.441489361702128
3060592,4,B00116GEJS,"I have been waiting to remember why I loved the first Lonesome Dove and basically not liking any that followed. The friendship between Woodrow
and Cal while the horror goes on is similar to our sit at home watching TV
America. It is a nice Yin Yang dark and light that reflects our real world.
Friendship is how we get through all the BS. Comanche Moon with all the
the excellent production values and excellent acting had me whistling in appreciation; I was not bothered a bit by the historical mistakes because the charm of the characters had me smiling. Sequels are tough and it is
hard to live up our memories of a great series. Comanche Moon completes
the saga: the beginning journey that illuminates Lonesome Dove's
bitter sweets themes.",1200528000,41,743,4.679389312977099
3060593,1,B00116GEJS,"Long and boring with little action, they do not even give you the thrill of seeing the good guys fight the bad guys! They spend too much time on the loves and lives of the Austin women, more like a romance instead of a western.
The worst of the movie is how the American Indians are treated. They receive little credit and hardly any lines, they are even listed last on the opening credits! Wes Studi plays Buffalo Hump, he is a magnificent actor and I do not believe they justified his talent. Adam Beach plays Blue Duck, he is also a very talent actor, he had very limited parts which is not fair considering Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump are main characters in the novel the movie is based on. The no name white women received more lines than Wes and Adam put together. Eddie Spears, star of  Black Cloud, is a rising young star and they show him sitting on a horse for like three seconds. Unless you research the movie, you do not even know he is playing Quannah Parker.  I would have much rather watched these warriors in battle rather than listen to Clara and Maggie cry over their love lives. But as usual they show the Indians as a bunch of wild savages raping white women instead of brave warriors fighting for their race's survival. For those of those who do not know any better Buffalo Hump and Quannah Parker were not fictional characters.
  The rangers do not fight, do not rescue, do nothing much except ride around and look at everything and everyone like they are in a trance. I think they are also talented actors, just received poor lines.
  And yes, I have read the book. The book does not spend this much time on the women and the book has action! It is the movie and the acting  that I am reviewing, not the book. The book serves as a basic format, no movie is ever the same as the book. The Comanche Moon screenplay was co-written with Diana Ossana.",1200528000,20,1868,4.350574712643678
3060594,5,B00116GEJS,"Having seen Lonesome Dove and in 1989, I was a bit skeptical about a ""prequel"" to this great mini-series.  But I must admit, Steve Zahn did an amazing job of a young August McRae and reminding me how much I loved Robert Duvall's character - adult Gus.  Slow to start on the first night, but well worth the wait to see Inez Scull get her just desserts!  Watching this new part of the saga makes me want to buy this one and the Loneseome Dove original and watch them over and over again!",1200528000,13,485,4.193548387096774
3060595,3,B00116GEJS,"I read the book first and loved it. Couldn't wait for the movie. The acting was only mediocre. Steve Zahn was good as Augustus Mcrea. He seemed to have studied Robert Duvall's mannerism's, speech and hand gestures. He is no Robert Duvall though. The other fellow who played Captain Call was not up to snuff. He had a long way to go to be as good as Tommy lee Jones. I like Val Kilmer as an actor but the part he played really was weird. Sort of a loony rich man. Didn't seem to be an important part of the movie. Wes Studi was great as Buffalo Hump. Would like to have seen his part more in the movie. I liked the little boy that played Newt. He did a good job. Very likable. This movie ranks low in my book in the Lonesome Dove Movies. The original Lonesome Dove was the best. Return to Lonesome Dove and Streets of Laredo are a close second and third. This one lacked something the others had. Maybe not as emotional and not as good actors. I probably will not buy this dvd. It's just not good enough for my library. Too bad.

3060596,1,B00116GEJS,"I'll start by saying I loved LONESOME DOVE. However, as great as that mini-series was, that's how awful COMANCHE MOON is. It's tedious, boring, and completely historically inaccurate. The action shown in the commercials is about all the action you'll see. The rest is long, talky, boring filler.

How can a writer like Larry McMurtry have Gus say to Call ""We don't even own the horses we're riding"" when anyone over the age of six who knows anything at all about the Texas Rangers knows the Rangers had to provide their own horses? The State of Texas didn't furnish them. Basic and obvious error.

The story is full of holes like that. Men talking about their ""Ranger careers"" when before the Civil War, when this story is set, the Texas Rangers were a volunteer force. No one made a career of Rangering at that time.

The acting is inept, the characters cliches, the settings bizarre. ""Austin"" is set in the middle of a near-desert. The land bears no resemblance to the topography around the real Austin. The Comanche attack on Austin is weird beyond belief. Why not have that take place around Victoria or Galveston where such events really happened.

You have riders in Western saddles posting to the trot as if they were on a hunt course, and a horse that was supposedly gored by a longhorn just standing there calm as can be, not showing a sign of distress or pain as obviously fake blood pours from its belly. As another person said, this film is so bad even the horses can't act. The producers couldn't even get the birds right. A ""parrot"" is actually a blue and gold macaw.

The big buildup to what the viewer is led to believe will be a major confrontation between Captain Scull and Ahlomado, his captor, leads to a bizarre and nothing denouement.

There are so many errors, plot flaws, and just plain bad scenes, lines, and acting a list of them would be as long as the COMANCHE MOON script.

Don't waste your money on this DVD. Just watch LONESOME DOVE again. You'll do far better.",1200441600,31,1992,4.578651685393258

3060650,4,B00116GEJS,"A very nice explanation of the early relationship between Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae during their days as Texas rangers.  Val Kilmer was a bit over the top, but the rest of the acting is great.  Both Urban as the taciturn Call and Zahn as the rambling McCrae are entirely believable as the characters that have matured in Lonesome Dove.  The only other criticism is that there is not much of a development about the relationship, if you can call it that, between Call and Clara.  I have always loved Angelica Huston's Clara ""I despised you then for what you were, and I despise you now for what you are doing."" put down of Call in Lonesome Dove.

On a side note, from everything I have read about the Comanche wars in Texas, the brutality and attitudes of the Comanche and the Texans to each other as depicted in the movie appear to be accurate.  They hated each other.",1510617600,,870,4.440251572327044

3060840,3,B00116GEJS,"If you love Lonesome Dove (the miniseries) as much as I do, you have probably watched it so many times that you can never watch it again. Because you know every line, every nuance. So you look around for some other vehicle that can get you to that unique place, some other piece of the McCrae-Call saga that will serve.

You know that James Garner can never be Woodrow Call, so you pass over the Streets of Laredo. You keep looking.

And you find Comanche Moon, a prequel which was at least a book written by Larry McMurtry before it became a miniseries directed by Simon Wincer, the very wizard that had directed Lonesome Dove! And in this story you get to see the boys when they were younger, thinking about retirement but still rangering. Yes, here are the younger Gus, Woodrow, and Blue Duck, and Lori's mother Maggie, whom Call would never acknowledge as the mother of his child Newt.

What actors play the two principals, you ask? And how do they fare? Well Steve Zahn plays Gus McCrae. You may know him from Riding in Cars with Boys, and I certainly cherish him for his role in the little-watched film Shattered Glass, in which he plays a reporter who exposes a writer for the New Republic who makes up stories. Steve Zahn, unfortunately, is the reason Comanche Moon falters. Another guy plays Woodrow Call. His name is Karl Urban, and he does better.

The thing about Lonesome Dove is that the main characters had INTELLIGENCE. Augustus was a genuine philosopher with a wonderfully droll outlook and a mystical appreciation of lifes details. Even Woodrow Call, despite his clipped, laborious values and discomfort with the feminine side, had a wickedly sardonic sense of humor, which he often turned on Gus to good effect. And Frederic Forrest as the sadistic rogue Indian, Blue Duck, was an edgy, perceptive character whose sarcasm easily matched that of Captain McCrae.

But in the prequel, not so much. It isn't just because the actors aren't furnished with lines that are as soulful and shrewd  which they definitely arent. (McMurtry seems to have gotten lazy since his greatest novel.) Its also because the actors don't quite know how to be natural. Maybe they are trying too hard to be heroic, like Tom Hanks did in Apollo 13. But give Steve Zahn credit. he comes up with a very passable impression of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae. The mannerisms are there! The problem is not his performance, which is a very good effort: the problem is that Zahn is miscast. As a specimen of the male animal, he simply cant convey the gravitas, danger, glamour, leadership, and warrior intensity that Robert Duvall gave us. Zahn isn't leading man material. We know what Duvall was like when he was young, because we saw him in The Godfather. His role was that of a faithful aide-de-camp, a right-hand man, and we didn't see that he could thrill us as Gus McCrae and make us believe he could ride in like the wrath of God and assassinate a whole troop of wastrels who were holding a young woman hostage and were about to despoil her. But we still saw that he was a force to be reckoned with, a man who held his own with Brando as Vito Corleone.

We do have Val Kilmer though, giving a crazy-good performance as Inish Scull, a sort of monster of military ferocity who is also an eccentric thinker and a fine singer, and who is the leader of the Texas Rangers before he hands off that duty to Call and McCrae and heads out into the wilderness to create a future rescue mission for our heroes. We also have two fine performances by Linda Cardellini as Clara Forsythe, the love of Gus's life, and by the wondrous Elizabeth Banks as the aforementioned Maggie. It's true that Cardellini is no Angelica Huston, but I always felt that that actress was a little too much for her role.

In the background we hear the same kind of stately, sad instrumental music that we recall from Lonesome Dove, whose message is that brave men will go on futile missions where they are as likely as not to get killed, and so the women whom they love will be forced into poverty, sickness, or bad marriages  heartbreak all around, folks. The kind of heartbreak we are partial to!

So, is it worth it? Well, watching Comanche Moon is kind of like being visited by the son of a man you once loved, a man for all seasons who got too old and died, and now his son is in the rocking chair on your porch, sipping beer instead of bourbon, and he is not as bright and not as fiery as his dad, but he does remind you some of the one whom you lost, so the pain in your heart is assuaged just a bit, the pain of missing that great friend.

So I watched Comanche Moon and then damn it, I decided to watch Lonesome Dove again, and one thing I can say is that it never seemed so gleaming and so much fun.",1464307200,12,4761,4.460919540229885

3060894,5,B00116GEJS,"Our Rangers covering the period between ""Dean Man Walking"" and ""Lonesome Dove"".  Kilmer is great as a weird yet savvy leader of the Rangers.  Steve Zahn must have studied Duval to get the right gestures and postures, yet managed to make the role his own.  Karl Urban handled Capt. Call well.  The writers left out the famous Call temper scene - which has been in every other epsidode of this saga.  Speaking of which, Pea Eye Parker is real young here, in Lonesome Dove he appears about 10 years senior,  and in Streets of Laredo he's now 15 years younger, enough to have married Lorena - who became a real b***h - and father 4 children, one who is a pre-teen?  Our Indian antagonists get a little lost. Buffalo Hump here is a chief who looks into his retirement.  In DMW he was a very energetic loner who appeared out of nowhere.  Blue Duck in Comanche is a feisty, young troublemaker.  In Lonesome Dove he's much older yet still a threat.  Mok-mok keeps appearing but really gets little notice until Streets of Laredo.  I guess I'm saying this follows very well in its order and covers major characters that had gotten lost in the other episodes.",1453161600,2,1148,4.519417475728155

3060900,5,B00116GEJS,In my opinion - the best movie to come out of the Lonesome Dove series!  Steve Zahn clearly studied Duvall's Gus and totally nails it.  Karl Urban is excellent as well.

3060932,4,B00116GEJS,"Just watched it again a few days ago. Steve Zahn does a remarkable job of playing young Gus McCrae. Urban was just okay as
Woodrow Call, but who can follow in Tommy Lee Jones' footsteps?  No one.
Val Kilmer and his slutty wife were a bit much.  He over acted his part in my opinion.
I'm glad I came across this movie at a Goodwill store because I wasn't aware Lonesome Dove had young McCrae and Call and all
the other characters in that series. I love the theme song in Lonesome Dove too. Great musical score.",1439164800,2,509,4.237113402061856

Would someone please tell me who portrayed the little Hispanic boy who is orphaned and then adopted by the neighbor lady? I also would like to know the character's name in the film. I found the scene most touching when the child realizes his mother has died.

3061097,5,B00116GEJS,"I'm a huge fan of the Robert Duval / Tommy Lee Jones original miniseries, but I've never read any of the books. I was skeptical when I ran across this movie; how could anyone else play Gus McCrae or Woodrow Call? I was very pleasantly surprised to see that Steve Zahn had adopted the accent and mannerisms that Robert Duval used for the original character. He was entirely believable as young Gus McCrae. Karl Urban did passably well as Woodrow, although he actually looks like a younger Robert Ulrich, so why didn't they cast him as young Jake Spoon? Val Kilmer's character is pretty awesome- he comes across as an oddball at first and his character is certainly eccentric. However, he is gradually revealed to be worthy of the legendary reputation he possesses. It was interesting seeing Woodrow and Maggie, as well as Gus & Clara (the actress playing Clara wasn't as spot on or sharp-tongued as Anjelica Houston). Overall, the production values were excellent, and fans of Westerns will be entirely pleased with this miniseries. The soundtrack isn't quite as moving as the original Lonesome Dove soundtrack, but it's hard for lightning to strike twice.

Bottom Line: Entertaining Western, well worth your money, especially for fans of the original series.",1409961600,2,1258,4.962085308056872

3061151,5,B00116GEJS,I can watch this movie over and over again. For anyone who has see the original lonesome dove this movie shows you alot that you may not understand about it. Like the town lonesome dove and the Rangerin' days. It is very good I actually like it more than lonesome dove itself but when watched together it fits in perfectly together. The cast could not have played the roles better. Val Kilmer was not in the original but is in Comanche Moon is absolutely fantastic. If you are a western movie buff this is definitely worth a look.,1369440000,,530,4.418367346938775
3061152,3,B00116GEJS,"Larry Mc Murtry's material has been swept into prequels, sequels, exploitequals, etc, so Comanche Moon (I have most of his books and read this one with interest after the original Lonesome Dove TV and book) has always seemed a little contrived and disjointed. Mc Murtry has the awkward position, in a prequel,  of being able to razzle the plot and shape the destiny of the story while being obliged to take great care, honour authenticity and bear a duty to literature in evading and avoiding traps of logic, morals, ethics, common sense and accepted literary traditions. He has an endless inner concept of character and a professional reassessment of the period so that little challenge might be made of details and accuracy. It's a little stilted, a little diluted, a little stiff compared to the public position and reputation of Lonesome Dove. A sequel to Lonesome Dove on TV was thin, sick and weedy. The Dead Man's Walk made for good TV viewing. So is this, and, I'll return to it soon. It's about a three and a halfer now.",1369008000,2,1029,4.716666666666667

3061178,2,B00116GEJS,The story is a prequal to the original story and helps set the stage but is only average in acting and production.

3061180,4,B00116GEJS,As a big fan of Lonesome Dove I was pleasantly surprised at the production and direction of this TV Movie. As always with the writing of Larry McMurty its dialogue is always a pleasure to listen to. The use of subtitles for the Commance language makes for more realistic characterisations of the native americans. How the actors coped with this problem I do not know but it works. The location filming made it a pleasure to watch on a large plasma screen. Lennie Niehaus's score was up to his usual high standard. Highly recommended.,1353801600,,533,4.680851063829787
3061181,3,B00116GEJS,"It's no surprise Larry McMurtry wrote two prequels to his classic ""Lonesome Dove,"" and only one sequel. The prequels, after all, are able to include the irrepressible Gus McCrae! While nobody will ever beat Robert Duvall's portrayal, both David Arquette in ""Dead Man's Walk"" and Steve Zahn in ""Comanche Moon"" bring him recognizably back to us. He and Captain Call (this time played by Karl Urban) are what draw most fans back to the universe of ""Lonesome Dove"" again and again.

Unfortunately, that universe changes considerably in ""Comanche Moon,"" the action of which takes place in Austin, not Lonesome Dove, despite the original book and miniseries implying otherwise. More significantly, almost everything established about Woodrow's history with Maggie and Newt in ""Lonesome Dove's"" back story is wholly rewritten, and it almost ruins the character of Call. In ""Lonesome Dove,"" he's a man who had a fling with a whore, then felt he was getting in too deep, quit her, and was unwilling to believe the son she bore was his--after all, she was a prostitute--while she drank herself to death. Later, he and Gus took the boy in to raise, but Call could not acknowledge his son.

That's bad enough, especially with both Clara Allen and Gus insisting that the boy is Call's spitting image, but we can understand without condoning. At least he was no deadbeat dad. He fed and raised and protected the boy. His failures hurt us, but they rarely enraged us.

In ""Comanche Moon,"" Maggie is played by the very likable Elizabeth Banks. She and Call are pretty much living together for quite some time, including *during* her pregnancy. Her love for him shows through in her every word and glance. Still, he refuses to marry her over the *years* that she is raising Newt as a single mother, despite that he continues to visit with her and she turns her life around and becomes a respectable shop girl whom everyone in town apparently loves. A whore-turned-respectable-shop girl is as unlikely as a whore-turned-schoolteacher (see: ""Streets of Laredo""). Still, that's what we're shown, and Call's moral paralysis over so much time turns him into someone it's difficult not to despise.

""Comanche Moon"" also includes McMurtry's increasingly heavy reliance on ""quirky"" characters--this time the Scull couple--and time spent with the Native Americans, which thankfully did not dominate the original ""Lonesome Dove,"" as well as his usual fascination with torture and rape. There's plenty of shoot-em-up action and frontier humor. If I had never seen ""Lonesome Dove,"" I might give ""Comanche Moon"" 4 instead of 3 stars. It's great to see Gus and Call again. Their adventures as Texas Rangers remain entertaining. But their romantic escapades, on which ""Comanche Moon"" focuses, are ultimately disappointing.",1345161600,,2790,5.1118421052631575

3061198,2,B00116GEJS,"When the lights come on at the end of a film and people start filing out of the theater, I'm one of the handful of people who sit and read the credits.  I still don't know exactly what a gaffer does.  One of the most curious credits for me is ""casting"".  I always thought the directors and/or producers did the casting.  When I see interviews with movie people and they tell the stories about how they became involved in a project, I've NEVER heard the story ""well, this casting director called me...""

The reason I'm spending all this time talking about casting is that in many decades of movie and television viewing, this is the first time I actually had the thought ""the casting for this film is absolutely TERRIBLE.""

The blessing - and the curse - of all of the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lonesome-Dove/dp/B0018PH3L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lonesome Dove</a>"" films is that they will all be compared to the original, an icon that ranks high on frequently produced ""best ever"" lists of both mini-series and westerns.  In the original Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones gave definitive performances as Augustus ""Gus"" McCrae and Woodrow Call in the first of the Lonesome Dove stories written by Larry McMurtry.  The original cast was rounded out by Robert Urich as Jake Spoon, Angelica Huston as Clara, and Danny Glover as Deets.

Naysayers will say ""this wasn't SUPPOSED to be Lonesome Dove, and THIS cast was only giving their own performance from McMurtry's source material"" or something of the like.

Poppycock.

In the same way that I can't adequately suspend my disbelief in biographical films unless the actor achieves some reasonable facsimile of the original (such as Helen Mirren in her Oscar-winning turn as Queen Elizabeth II) I also can't enjoy a film with different actors cast in familiar roles unless they do an adequate job ""making it their own.""  It seems a little unfair to report that Steve Zahn is no Robert Duvall.  I give him some credit for even trying.  Karl Urban would have been spectacular in this film - as Jake Spoon.  I would ask the gentle reader to compare not only photos of Mr. Urban and Mr. Urich, but if you decide to watch this film - compare the performances of the two as well.  It is so unsettling - the effect is as if Jake Spoon decided just prior to commencement of filming ""I'm kinda TIRED of bein' Jake Spoon.  You know whut, Woodrow?  I think I'm a-gonna be YOU fer a spell.""

As I said - I don't know exactly the jobs of people who get casting credits - but it seems that if you have an actor available who can duplicate a major character in a role reprisal, you have done the work and the audience a disservice if you cast this actor in a different role.  Among the thousands of SAG members they couldn't find a single person who could suggest the appearance and mannerisms of Tommy Lee Jones as Woodrow?  (Too bad that Jonny Lee Miller must have been busy doing ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eli-Stone-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B001ASIHZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eli Stone: The Complete First Season</a>"" instead of being available to try the part again as he did in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Larry-McMurtry-s-Dead-Man-s-Walk/dp/B00368PSKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Larry McMurtry's Dead Man's Walk</a>."")

All of the above would be bad enough, but the writing (both plot and dialogue) and acting are across the board a substantial step backwards from any previous ""Lonesome Dove"" incarnation.  I would only recommend this for Lonesome Dove devotees who absolutely have to view every frame ever filmed about Gus and Woodrow.",1295308800,4,3716,5.197986577181208
3061199,4,B00116GEJS,"I've just purchase the entire movie series, Dead mans walk, Comanche Moon, Lonesome Dove, Return to Lonesome Dove and The Streets of Laredo. Originally I did not appreciate Dead mans walk. Johnny Lee Miller as Capt Woodrow F Call was very good. He captured the intense persona of the character. However David Arquette as Capt Augustus McCrae was very under whelming. He was poorly cast and I was expecting more. I could see none of the characteristics that would illustrate to me, that this guy would be the heroic ""Gus"" from Lonesome Dove.

With that being said. Comanche Moon is a different animal altogether. First lets start with the casting. The principle actors Steve Zahn as Augustus McCrae and Karl Urban as Woodrow F Call were spot on. Personally I believe that it is easy for a halfway decent actor to portray Captain Call because he is such an emotionally pent up guy. And I'm not trying to minimize Tommy Lee Jones because I'm not. He made that character. But I feel as though any actor who portray Augustus would have to address a broader range of emotions. But with Captain Call all that an actor has to do is show very little emotion. However Steve Zahn is a marvel! He perfectly captured the mannerisms that Robert Duvall introduce to this character. Just watch his voice inflection's and hand gesture's and mannerisms, that's Gus!! This film would not have worked if Zahn would not have done his home work with this character. Comanche Moon focused on both of the main characters quite often. However this film was really a character study on Augustus McCrae. In the very same way that ""Dead Man's Walk"" was a character study on Captain Call.

The rest of the cast was fine, but I don't want to fake it! It's really about Call and Gus! Having Simon Wincer to return as the director was fantastic. However each episode did not end with the exciting punch that concluded each one of his previous Lonesome Dove episodes from the original mini series. In those episodes, each show had a dramatic ""punch"" that caused you to want to see the next one. I remember watching the first episode from the mini series on a cold February Sunday in 1989. When the series began, I never thought that I would be sitting and watching the entire mini series. But after viewing episode 1# and the way that it ended,I was hooked!

And the musical score was minor to say the least. The Lonesome Dove was scored by Basil Poledouris. His melodies where haunting to say the least. Listen to ""On the trail"" During the long Wagon train trail march in the harsh terrain from the first Lonesome Dove. That melody has stayed with me for 21 years. However, as much as I love Comanche Moon, the film suffers from a poor musical score. The original series clearly illustrate that a compelling score is just as important as casting good actors.

To conclude, Comanche Moon is very good! It's better than Dead Man's Walk. But Dead Man's walk had a better sound track. I highly recommend that you purchase these films. And if you've never seen them before? Then I envy you, because you have the pleasure of watching them all, for the first time. Lucky you.

3061201,5,B00116GEJS,"For anyone who loves a good western, the ""Lonesome Dove"" movies are a must see. I ordered Comanche Moon and soon realized it was part of the Lonesome Dove story.

#2...Comanche Moon
#3...Lonesome Dove
#4...Return To Lonesome Dove
#5...Lonesome Dove The Series
#6...Lonesome Dove The Outlaw Years
#7...Streets Of Loredo

A few years pass between Comanche Moon and Lonesome Dove. Lonesome Dove & Return To Lonesome Dove are like watching one movie. It picks up right where Lonesome Dove left off. In my opinion the best two movies of the seven, although all are worth watching.
Lonesome Dove The Outlaw Years has the same charactors, but it is 22 episods. It reminded me a bit like Gunsmoke, the same town, the same people, but a different story each week. They are all good, just not a continous story. If you watch all 7 movies you will have approx. 60 hours of entertainment. Very enjoyable, and you will feel like you're back in the 1980's. There are so many different charactors and so much happens, I plan on watching it over again many times. You will follow the lives of Gus McCrea & Woodrow Call. It is quite addicting. You will enjoy each movie and wanting more.
The only complaint is there is a few things left un resolved. It's almost like there should have been a few more movies to tell the entire story.
I highly recommend these movies.

3061206,4,B00116GEJS,"I put off watching this because I had been disappointed with the book's major sub-plot involving torture. It's still there in the video, but it's downplayed and makes more sense somehow. Val Kilmer does a great job playing the torture-ee and making the point that the character is challenged to try new experiences at any cost.

The movie has a really superb look and attention to detail. For example the rangers are always with the correct firearms, going from what I think is a Sharps rifle to the Winchester ""Yellowboy"" between the late '50s and late '60s. The history is pretty accurate too, from what I've read on the subject. Buffalo Hump really did lead a Comanche raid to the Gulf and Charles Goodnight was one of the Rangers who ""rescued"" Cynthia Ann Parker, saying exactly what he said in the video. However, Quanah and Peta Nakona hanging out together is not so accurate. I believe current thinking is that Peta Nakona was killed when Quanah was 12 years old by Sul Ross, future governor of Texas (which is a pretty interesting story in itself).

The leads do a pretty good job. The difference in heights between Woodrow and Gus is a little weird, but they capture the mannerisms and vocals pioneered by Duval and Jones and they look pretty macho. The action is pretty cool with nice riding and shooting and some creative camera angles. So, I'd say not as good as Lonesome Dove, but worth watching. If you haven't seen any of the four mini-series I'd recommend going chronological, which would be - Dead Man's Walk - Comanche Moon - Lonesome Dove - Streets of Laredo. I'd also highly recommend the books, and just about every other book written by McMurtry.",1279065600,,1668,4.689419795221843

3061216,5,B00116GEJS,"""Commanche Moon"", is a fairly interesting prequel to ""Lonsome Dove"", which I think most LD fans will appreciate.

While Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call as played by Steve Zahn and Karl Urban may take some getting used to, by the film's conclusion, the actors are firmly established as their characters.  Zahn does a great job of portraying the McCrae character as fleshed out by Robert Duvall, but anytime he would be situated next to Urban, I found myself wishing that someone had put him on a soap box or something, to add a few inches.

Karl Urban as Call was as wooden as the Tommy Lee Jones Call, but Val Kilmer as Captain Inish Scull is great.  I was a little surpised at how well the film followed the book in how this character, and his antagonists were true to McMurty's vision.

If you're looking for answers to your questions about ""Lonesome Dove"", ""Commanche Moon"" pretty well illustrates the prior exploits of most of the LD characters and the reasons for their actions.  Buffalo Hump and son, Blue Duck are well represented. Maggie Tilton is only part of the dialogue in ""Lonsome Dove"", but in ""Commanche Moon"", her relationship to Call is far more expanded and explained, especially in comparison to the earlier ""Dead Man's Walk"".

Even more revealing, ""Commanche Moon"" also goes into some detail concerning the prior exploits of Jake Spoon and his relationship to McCrae and Call.  ""Don't take up with any hoodlums.  We'd hate to have to hang you,"" is something spoken to Spoon by McCrae towards the end of the film that is said in jest, but LD fans will be able to immediately pick up on the irony.

Like ""Lonsome Dove"", there were various points where I, as a viewer, thought that the story could end, but then surprisingly, the story continued.  Therefore, when the end of ""Commanche Moon"" finally did come, it was sort of a surprise.  The good thing about the ending itself is that it is an apt lead-in to ""Lonesome Dove"", which, timeline-wise, begins only about ten years later.

""Commanche Moon"" isn't a great film, like ""Lonesome Dove"", but it's a very good one, and I think, a better addition to the LD series than ""Dead Man's Walk"" or ""The Streets of Laredo"".

I've given it five stars because it doesn't need to great to be enjoyable, and I really enjoyed ""Commanche Moon"".",1238630400,31,2295,4.662531017369727

3061220,3,B00116GEJS,"I thought this recent TV miniseries was okay but a far cry from ""Lonesome Dove, ""  as it was being compared since it is a prequel to that famous story.

""Commanche Moon"" is definitely worth a watch for any fan of westerns. Just don't expect it to be as intense as ""Lonesome Dove."" Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play aren't as strong.  Some say it's unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison but you have to compare it - it's the story of the same two leading Texas Ranger characters: ""Woodrow Call"" and ""Gus McCrae.""

The main difference, I found, was that this prequel is a lot of slower and more relational (the two Rangers and their women) at times. Yet, I didn't mind that because the two main women were pretty ladies and likable people. They were played nicely by Linda Cardelini (""Clara Forsythe"") and Elizabeth Banks (""Maggie.""). They helped make this long movie palatable.  Maggie's son ""Newt"" was a wonderful kid, too - the kind of boy every parent would want.

The most interesting character, I thought, turned out to be ""Inish Scull,"" played by Val Kilmer. As in the western film, ""Tombstone,"" Kilmer almost steals the show from the leads. ""Scull"" is really an original, if I ever saw one: a strange dude, indeed.

Actually, all of the supporting actors in here did a fine job, from Keith Robinson's ""Deets"" to Wes Studi as ""Buffalo Hump."" I always find Studi to be fascinating, no matter what role he plays. I wish he had had a bigger role in this miniseries.

One thing this film has in common with ""Lonesome Dove"" and other good westerns: the scenery and photography. It's just beautiful at times and is a joy to watch. We also have an excellent director of this film: Simon Wincer.

Another thing, you get your money's worth: the two-disc DVD version is  about 4 hours and 40 minutes.",1233705600,7,1878,4.57910447761194

3061225,5,B00116GEJS,"Back in the 1840's the State Texas was known as the Texas Republic, a harsh environment where several cultures clashed: Apache and Comanche, Anglos and Hispanics, for the most part, Mexicans. The battle over land, water and resources was furious, the spirit of these men as they set out to conquer, indomitable. The Texas Rangers were members of a law enforcement agency that investigated crimes from murder to political corruption, tracking fugitives and forging most important events in Texas history.

In their early days, the Texas Rangers protected the frontier against Indian attacks on settlers, then serving as scouts, spies, couriers, and guides for those wishing to settle in the West. These men were trained to aim, fire and reload their weapons from horseback, an amazing development from the usual technique of dismounting before shooting at enemies and reloading.

This is the second installment to a trilogy centered on the lives of two men, Augustus ""Gus"" McCrae, played by Steve Zahn and Woodrow Call, played by Karl Urban.

Comanche Moon presents the Rangers, now serving under an eccentric character played by Val Kilmer, working to protect the territories against the Comanches. Buffalo Hump, played by Wes Studi, and his son Blue Duck, played by Adam Beach.

We see the men falling in love, with Call playing the role of a quiet, introspective and isolative man who does not know how to understand and therefore, handle women, get involved with a prostitute who bears him a son. McRae falls in love with the store owner's daughter, Clara, but because his style of life is not to be depended upon, they never make it to marriage.

The movie brings romance, adventure and a view to life in the west. Don't miss it.",1221091200,4,1733,4.962068965517242

3061229,2,B00116GEJS,"I've followed both the book and made-for-TV series for quite a while. While I believe the novel Comanche Moon was a pretty decent read, this movie adaptation is the worst of the Lonesome Dove series.

Zahn did a decent job as Gus McRae (you can tell he had studied Duvall's  portrayal of the character and tried to get down the technique, and while not perfect, it wasn't bad) - but most of the other actors literally sounded like they were reading right from the script. Urban was really a terrible W.F.Call, and while I thought West Studi was good as Famous Shoes in Streets of Laredo, he didn't seem to fit the role of Buffalo Hump in this one, not at all. Val Kilmer was absolutely awful as Inish Scull. Instead of giving the impression he was a tough, if slightly eccentric Yankee-in-Texas, he came across as a clown.

I noticed Halmark/Artisan didn't produce this one as they did the others in the series (which were all better - I'd rank them in this order as the best to least: Lonesome Dove, Streets of Laredo, Dead Man's Walk) and I don't know if that had something to do with it, but this was pretty bad. I'm not even comparing it to Lonesome Dove other than to say Zahn did a decent job of learning Duvall's mannerisms for McRae, but even as a stand alone Western this one just felt cheap and looked cheap. Almost no one seemed to have really gotten into acting their characters and it shows.",1215302400,2,1404,4.434108527131783

Val Kilmer gave a fearless performance of Captain Skull which was spot on from the character portrayed in the book.  The supporting cast was equally as good, the direction excellent and the story well paced and interesting.

I find it intriging the way Larry McMurtry portrays women in his novels. Strong,brave and vulnerable, living a life that gives them so few choices. They really can't count on the crusty and sometimes invulnerable men they fall in love with so they make do with eachother's help.

The complete story finishes with Streets of Laredo.  One of the most interesting parts is the depiction of the state capital, Austin, in its early years.  Additionally, what makes all four movies of the series so compelling is the character development of the main characters, so that it is not just a ""shoot 'em up"" with a lot of action but no story to tell, but rather, a tale that leaves you wanting to know what happens to Gus and Woodrow in the next stage.

3061234,4,B00116GEJS,"Finally we have the last chapter in the lonesome dove saga
after years of supposed adaptations of Larry mcmurtry's final lonesome dove tale to close out and link up the middle years of McCrae,Call and cronies. Simon Wincer
the original miniseries director has returned to bookend
the series and does an estimable job, while not on the scale of the original , Wincer talkles amuch broader canvas especially in regard to the comanche who at the time  were still quite able to vigourasously defend their culture and territory. Val Kilmer as Inish Skull has been critized as portraying the eccentric ranger leader as over the top when in fact scull is exactly that as created by McMurtry. Kilmer seems to enjoy the character as is a off the radar contrast to most of the main characters. In Dead Man's Walk Woodrow Call recieved a bit more story time at least in character building while in Comanche MOON Augustus McCrae is given substantive screen time via Steve Zahn to project the beloved ranger
we have come to know throughout the series. In Comanche
Moon zahn's gus is his ownand does succeed in bringing
a familiar character with his own nuances recognizable
but new. Karl Urban also succeed's but in a lesser degree
but he has less to work with as Call's make up has been
established in previous stories what Urban has left is aman who is in pain for being who heis and pain in being unable to truly embrace a future with a woman he clearly loves and who desperately loves him . His dedication to
keeping the Texas republic safe and his friendship with gus are his only respite. Ryan Merriman is miscast as
 Jake Spoon and in fact is given even less to do than in the novel. Wes Studi is probably the most talented of native actors today  and brings a dignity of character and
time to his portrayal of Buffalo Hump. Technically i do not think ,however he was the proper choice for Buffalo Hump. Though aging the comanche apearance should be closer though older to Eric Schweig's in Dead Man's Walk
an actor like Steve Reevis who actually has a the role of worm or Gil Birmingham from Into the West  i would have prefered tom keep in line with previous versions though
if any of these actors could match studi's acting chops
is debatable. Jonathan Joss is wasted as he is hardly seen inthe miniseries as kicking wolf a major adversary of the rangers. Linda Cardenilli does afine job as Clara
andin fact brings in such more to the characterv that could be expected, the character of Maggie Tilton ,always
heard of and seen for a few scenes in Dead Man's Walk now comes to the fore  and MS. Banks work is admirable and tragic to watch. The locations are used wonderfully  filmed in New Mexico  and used to the greatest effect.
My Rewiew is apostive review with resevations regarding some casting and the much of the story edited out from
novel ,some of which has been restored in the dvd .
Part 1 moves along slowly with thoughts of a dis appointing adaptation,however that changes soon and the next chapters depicted reaffirm this western as a fine
sweeping ,exciting, tale . while again not 1989's lonesome dove or even Dead Man's Walk it is finally
 a welcome version of a saga long awaited for to close out

If producers are inclined to sink large amounts of cash into any made for TV movie, my advice is to do homework first and determine if the investment is wise.  The investment in COMANCHE MOON was most unwise.  Weak acting, weak dialogue, weak story are the result of a weak screenplay.  I was sooo bored with this production, dialogue, and romance scenes that I kept fast forwarding the play to find some action and ""true grit.""

I have to agree with most of the other reviews-the ensemble cast-while hosting several A-Listers-was too heavy on the bad acting side to make the multiple hour investment worthwhile.  While Val Kilmer and Steve Zahn do make valiant efforts to ""get it right"", the biggest disappointment was Carl Urban's.

Urban-who has the looks of a young Tommy Lee Jones-was too wooden and his southern accent was bad and even nonexistant in some parts.  This was a disappointment as I have liked Urban in other films, but it's looking like he may be a ""one trick pony"", ala Schwarzenegger and Vin Diesel.

The feminine side of the ensemble were the films downfall.  Griffiths was too caricature, Cardellini too comedic and high pitched and Banks-the most appropriate as Newts mom Maggie-was given literally nothing to work with-unfortunate since Maggie plays such a vital role post mortem in LD.

Commanche Moon could have been so much more, instead it's like visiting an old friend and wondering what drew you to them in the first place.  My advice-keep the beauty of Lonesome Dove without letting Commanche Moon spoil it.

Lonesome Dove, the novel and the miniseries, were as classic as classic gets. The Novel is one of the only books that I've ever read more than once. And the miniseries adaptation is just as memorable. The miniseries starred Robert Duvall as Augustus McCrae, Tommy Lee Jones as Woodrow Call, Rick Schroder as Newt, Diane Lane as Lorena Wood, Danny Glover as Joshua Deets, Robert Urich as Jake Spoon and Anjelica Huston as Clara Allen. What a line up of A-listers giving A-list performances. Duvall and Jones absolutely nailed the characters created by McMurtry in the novel. And Director Simon Wincer really preserved the integrity of the novel.

Streets of Laredo and Dead Man's Walk were good books, and adapted to fair-at-best miniseries. So when I saw that Comanche Moon was coming to CBS as the final book adaptation miniseries in January 2008, I was not that excited. But I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. Comanche Moon was a very good book and the miniseries was equally satisfying.

In Comanche Moon we find McCrae and Call as Texas Rangers as the Civil War is ending. They aren't involved in the Civil War as much as they are still battling the Comanches as well the cruel and diabolical bandit Ahumado. Val Kilmer is Captain Skull, and together with Gus, Woodrow and some other rangers they head out to the plains to get the bad guys.

There's a good amount of violence in some sequences, but some of the brutalities in the book have been tamed down for TV. (I.e. in the book Captain Skull's eyelids are removed by one of Ahumado's henchmen as a form of torture; that treatment is completely removed from the TV series.)

The miniseries producers did a smart thing: They brought back Wincer in the director's chair. And he once again brought a McMurtry novel to life with class and integrity. Comanche Moon (the novel or the miniseries) is no classic like Lonesome Dove was, but it was highly entertaining and enjoyable. However, like the last third of the novel, the Comanche Moon miniseries comes to grueling slow-down (in part 3 of the 3-part series). But it didn't take away from the enjoyment of watching Gus, Call and their crew as young, Pre-Lonesome Dove Texas Rangers looking for their place in life and trying to preserve life for others.

Steve Zahn is Gus McCrae and Karl Urban is Woodrow Call. They clearly read the book, watched the first miniseries and got some terrific direction from Director Wincer; they really captured the essence of their characters. And Val Kilmer should get an award for his portrayal of Captain Skull. There are some other popular (TV) actors in Comanche Moon, and they all combine to give us a very good CBS miniseries based on a very good book.

If you missed Comanche Moon on TV and you liked Lonesome Dove, you'll find this DVD quite enjoyable...with no commercials. Oh, and just how did the town of Lonesome Dove get its name?...Well, you'll just have to add this DVD to yer cart to find that out, pards.",1202169600,192,4466,6.1312
3061263,1,B00116GEJS,Watched the show on TV.. or to say the first installment only.  The acting was so terrible it was laughable.  Its a shame to see 'big name' actors do such a terrible job.  I am wondering if this was written by some high school students and adapted for TV due to the writers' strike.,1201824000,7,282,4.185185185185185
3061264,3,B00116GEJS,"We all miss Bill Wittliff. He was the writer on the teleplay on LONESOME DOVE, and did a masterful job of bringing Larry McMurtry's book come alive on the screen. I have read all four books of the Lonesome Dove epic and have  seen all of the TV adaptations.

Like other reviewers I was looking forward to COMMANCHE MOON on TV. It was a wonderful read, with great characters, such as the Skulls. But unless I was dozing during the second episode, none of that seemed to lead anywhere.

The New York Times was in my opinion a bit harsh calling the roles of Gus and Woodrow miscast. I think they did their best to mimic how these characters would have acted 15 years earlier in their lives. They did their best to inform the development of the characters over the years. But the reality is that Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones made these roles impossible to follow.

I was surprised that McMurtry who is generally very careful in his research chose to stage a Commanche raid on Austin, especially when there actually was one on Galveston, that was the whole point of what Bear Hump was talking about in ""driving to the sea.""

So I wound up showing the original to my friends once again on my 60 inch

3061266,3,B00116GEJS,"A few years back I stumbled onto a used copy of the book, COMANCHE MOON, on sale at my local library.  I bought it, eagerly read it, thoroughly enjoyed it and anxiously awaited what I assumed would be the inevitable excellent television release of the final film installment of the LONESOME DOVE saga.

Now that the movie version of the book has been released, it's time to sort things out. First the good things.

Simon Wincer, the director of the original LONESOME DOVE, is back with this video prequel. Wincer's eye is evident everywhere here as he paints panorama after panorama of a gorgeous western landscape. Wincer has become the consummate modern Western director and proves it again here.

There are some wonderful surprises in the cast. At first I was skeptical about casting Steve Zahn in the role of Augustus McCrae.  I assumed that Zahn, an actor famous for his airheaded portrayals of every character he has played, wouldn't have the ability to arise to a role defined, originally by the inimitable Robert Duvall.  But as the miniseries played out I found Zahn to be, not only believable in the role, but also extremely credible and charming. It was easy to see him as a young Duvall or, more to the point, a young McCrae.

Karl Urban does an equally fine job of portraying a young Woodrow Call. He's dry and straightforward, all business, with a stern approach to McMurtry's famous hero.  Moreover, the chemistry between Urban and Zahn is just what it should be.

We get a brief glimpse of Maggie Tilton's tragic character in DEAD MAN'S WALK.  COMANCHE MOON develops her, as she becomes a key figure in the LONESOME DOVE story. Here Elizabeth Banks does a wonderful job of portraying a woman of feeling and tenderness, one who rises above the horrible life of a frontier whore, seeking a life of respectability but not apologizing for what she has had to be in order to survive.

McMurtry is famous for including an array of nutty characters that bring an air of comedy as well as insanity to his works.  This is especially true of his LONESOME DOVE quartet.  In COMANCHE MOON the main players fitting this description are Inish and Inez Scull, portrayed, respectively, by Val Kilmer and Rachel Griffiths.  The book is replete with the adventures of these two, describing their doings and what is done to them, especially on the part of Kilmer's character, Inish.  And sadly, for me, the miniseries falls unforgivably short, and I am not blaming Kilmer or Griffiths, when it comes to the Sculls.  Yes, it may be that the TV medium wouldn't allow an accurate and graphic portrayal of what befalls Inish in the book (even though there is plenty of gore in Ahumado's encampment).  Yes, it may be that Inez's antics were equally racy and, therefore, the stuff that ended up on the cutting room floor.  But, frankly, I was surprised that McMurtry, being a co-writer on the project, would allow the whitewashed portrayal of these two that ensues in the movie. Accordingly, a star is, of necessity lost for skimping here.

An additional star has to be lost for the weakness of the remaining cast, a bumbling bunch that is so unbelievable that the story is nearly lost. Many are misportrayals of various key characters. McMurtry's Blue Duck, portrayed masterfully in the original LONESOME DOVE by Frederic Forrest, is the personification of evil and carries the half-breed chip on his shoulder with sinister accuracy.  In COMANCHE MOON, Adam Beach, though a fine actor in his own right, is far too Indian to be believable as a half-breed and falls considerably short of Forrest's portrayal.

A weak three stars for me. Yes, it completes the set and is a necessary watch for any follower of LONESOME DOVE. But COMANCHE MOON could have been far better.  It's as though McMurtry simply succumbed to the temptation to get this one out of the way and pocket his money and, so, skimped on the details that made LONESOME DOVE the classic that it remains in the Western genre.

3061267,4,B00116GEJS,"I just finished watching Comanche moon, and I have to say I thought it was very good.  Not nearly as good as lonesome dove, but that is like comparing apples to oranges.  The original Lonesome dove is hands down one of the greatest westerns of our time.  The actors were phenominal, the story was awesome, it pulled you in, and made you hold on the whole time.  Most of Lonesome Dove's appeal in movie form was due to the great actors, Tommy Lee Jones is Woodrow Call, no one will ever play that part like he did.  Gus is Robert Duvall, and no one will ever play that part as well as he did.  However I thought these actors Steve Zahn and Karl Urban did a fairly good job at playing the parts.  It is a hard act to follow, and they definitely did a better job then any other actors I have seen in any of the other Lonesome Dove series after the original.  Watching the others, dead mans walk, streets of laredo, return to lonesome dove, was just uncomfortable watching the actors trying to portray the characters that Tommy lee Jones and Robert Duvall brought to life on the screen.

 I will defnitely buy this movie to add to my lonesome dove collection.  To the review that said it wasn't historically accurate, it is a fictional series of books, not a historical one.",1201219200,3,1270,4.361702127659575
3061268,5,B00116GEJS,"I think this was an excellent prequel to Lonesome Dove!  Granted... IT IS NOT LONESOME DOVE.  They will never top that series... or even match it... who even expects it?  When I say Steve Zahn playing Gus I thought, ""This is going to be terrible!  How did they select him?"", but I was plesantly surprized!  He was excellent as Gus... mimicing Duval I thought was great... irritating... not at all... this was a young Gus, just as I would have expected him to be.  Steve did an excellent job!  I did expect a little more from Karl.  He could have opened up a little more, studied the character Call a little more.  I just didn't find much in his character other than being stiff.  The other characters:  Deets, Pea Eye, and Jake Spoon where not developed in detail, but it did make connection... it was a short series.  Maybe if it were as long as Lonesome Dove...  Technically correct... probably not, but you can be just as critical to most all movies.  I will certainly add it to my collection as it fills the gap.  I do wish it were longer or that they would add another series prior to Lonesome Dove for further character development.  I loved Val Kilmer's role, but I wished they would have developed or explored Gus and Calls' relationship with him more.  His character was weird, but I suppose that he was a source lending to their qualities and his wife supporting Gus as a playboy.",1201046400,6,1390,4.47410358565737
3061269,3,B00116GEJS,"I waited with increasing anticipation for this miniseries, and I must say, I was a little let down.  Only a little though.  It was nowhere near as bad as some of these reviews say (and I must say, being from Austin, there are parts of this city that ARE near-deserts) but it is also not as good as the original.  It is, however, BY FAR the best of the other ""Lonesome Dove"" movies.  I hated ""Return to Lonesome Dove"" enough to sour my impression of the original until I bought the DVD and remembered why I loved it in the first place.  The best part of this prequel by far was Steve Zahn's interpretation of Gus.  He had all of Robert Duval's mannerisms down and I felt that this prequel added significantly to the personal tragedy that ""followed"" in the original.  A worthwhile watch (especially for Zahn) and an improvement, despite the historical inaccuracies, over anything with the ""Lonesome Dove"" tag on it since the original.",1200960000,4,932,4.578313253012048
3061270,5,B00116GEJS,"This is the second part, fourth to be presented (I do not count the pathetic, not enough words to describe how bad it was, non-McMurtry ""Return to Lonesome Dove"" as a part) in the Lonesome Dove series.  The book and the mini-series are simply is not as good as Lonesome Dove.  That said, it is certainly not as bad as many here have said.  A consistent criticism seems to be the odd story lines, such as with Capt. Scull and his never completed climax with Ahumado.  Like it or dislike it, odd twists are staples of McMurtry writing.  You're not going to see them dueling in the middle of Main Street.  Having the arch villain bitten by a spider is much more likely in McMurtry's world.

Steve Zahn does a good job mimicking Robert Duvall's Augustus McCrae.  Some pan this and others like it.  I find myself in the latter camp.  When all is said and done, they are playing the character and trying to maintain some consistency.  For that matter, David Arquette played Duvall playing McCrae in Dead Man's Walk as well.  After Duvall's fantastic portrayal of Gus in Lonesome Dove, we wouldn't want Gus to act like Clint Eastwood.  And while Karl Urban plays a stiff Woodrow Call, Call was stiff.  That was the point of his character.  If he wasn't, he would have married Maggie, Gus wouldn't have kept going off rangering and married Clara, and there wouldn't be a story to tell.

Note that the story is NOT about the Comanches.  Hence, although they provide the driving force behind the story, the Comanche characters do not have as many lines or as much face-time on screen.  While the Comanche story would be one I would like to see, the Lonesome Dove series doesn't tell it.  If it did, the series would be called ""Palo Duro,"" not ""Lonesome Dove.""

On the bright side, the story is an interesting one full of twists, despite having to fill in between a known beginning and known ending.  It is not Lonesome Dove, but that is hard to expect.",1200960000,6,1942,4.522988505747127

The three follow ups, though not as good, were well done. ""Comanche Moon"" was a mess. Beinging with the poor screen play,the less then mediocre production, bad acting, ect. The camera work had the canvas of the old West to use, but I can't recall on time when they took advantage of the sceenery. The acting was just liveless. Even the little kid who played Newt look like a doll, when he should have look like a  boy. The relationship between Gus and Clara that was so real and full of feeling in the original just left me cool.
I should have known something was wrong when I saw that TV kept delaying its release. If there had not been a writters strike we may never have seen this Turkey.

The worst of the movie is how the American Indians are treated. They receive little credit and hardly any lines, they are even listed last on the opening credits! Wes Studi plays Buffalo Hump, he is a magnificent actor and I do not believe they justified his talent. Adam Beach plays Blue Duck, he is also a very talent actor, he had very limited parts which is not fair considering Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump are main characters in the novel the movie is based on. The no name white women received more lines than Wes and Adam put together. Eddie Spears, star of  Black Cloud, is a rising young star and they show him sitting on a horse for like three seconds. Unless you research the movie, you do not even know he is playing Quannah Parker.  I would have much rather watched these warriors in battle rather than listen to Clara and Maggie cry over their love lives. But as usual they show the Indians as a bunch of wild savages raping white women instead of brave warriors fighting for their race's survival. For those of those who do not know any better Buffalo Hump and Quannah Parker were not fictional characters.
  The rangers do not fight, do not rescue, do nothing much except ride around and look at everything and everyone like they are in a trance. I think they are also talented actors, just received poor lines.
  And yes, I have read the book. The book does not spend this much time on the women and the book has action! It is the movie and the acting  that I am reviewing, not the book. The book serves as a basic format, no movie is ever the same as the book. The Comanche Moon screenplay was co-written with Diana Ossana.",1200528000,20,1868,4.350574712643678

3295093,1,B00116GEJS,"I'll start by saying I loved LONESOME DOVE. However, as great as that mini-series was, that's how awful COMANCHE MOON is. It's tedious, boring, and completely historically inaccurate. The action shown in the commercials is about all the action you'll see. The rest is long, talky, boring filler.

How can a writer like Larry McMurtry have Gus say to Call ""We don't even own the horses we're riding"" when anyone over the age of six who knows anything at all about the Texas Rangers knows the Rangers had to provide their own horses? The State of Texas didn't furnish them. Basic and obvious error.

The story is full of holes like that. Men talking about their ""Ranger careers"" when before the Civil War, when this story is set, the Texas Rangers were a volunteer force. No one made a career of Rangering at that time.

The acting is inept, the characters cliches, the settings bizarre. ""Austin"" is set in the middle of a near-desert. The land bears no resemblance to the topography around the real Austin. The Comanche attack on Austin is weird beyond belief. Why not have that take place around Victoria or Galveston where such events really happened.

You have riders in Western saddles posting to the trot as if they were on a hunt course, and a horse that was supposedly gored by a longhorn just standing there calm as can be, not showing a sign of distress or pain as obviously fake blood pours from its belly. As another person said, this film is so bad even the horses can't act. The producers couldn't even get the birds right. A ""parrot"" is actually a blue and gold macaw.

The big buildup to what the viewer is led to believe will be a major confrontation between Captain Scull and Ahlomado, his captor, leads to a bizarre and nothing denouement.

There are so many errors, plot flaws, and just plain bad scenes, lines, and acting a list of them would be as long as the COMANCHE MOON script.

3295147,4,B00116GEJS,"A very nice explanation of the early relationship between Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae during their days as Texas rangers.  Val Kilmer was a bit over the top, but the rest of the acting is great.  Both Urban as the taciturn Call and Zahn as the rambling McCrae are entirely believable as the characters that have matured in Lonesome Dove.  The only other criticism is that there is not much of a development about the relationship, if you can call it that, between Call and Clara.  I have always loved Angelica Huston's Clara ""I despised you then for what you were, and I despise you now for what you are doing."" put down of Call in Lonesome Dove.

On a side note, from everything I have read about the Comanche wars in Texas, the brutality and attitudes of the Comanche and the Texans to each other as depicted in the movie appear to be accurate.  They hated each other.",1510617600,,870,4.440251572327044

I thought the story was rambling, wandering without any real direction, and the acting was for the most part second rate.  After a couple hours of viewing this turkey, I started fast forwarding through it just to cut short the pain of watching.  I almost bought this on DVD and then decided to rent it instead.  I recommend if you feel you must see this film, that you rent it and you won't feel quite so cheated. I really enjoy a good western, but this isn't it.",1494201600,,556,4.216981132075472

3295281,3,B00116GEJS,Nice installment of the series...great overall performances by top actors. But it looked like it was hastily made. Some points just did not fit with what was already made. Like Call is too refined when it comes to the rudeness of some. And the major problem is where Maggie Tillman dies. Gus yells at Call in reference to her death of how she waited in the saloon of Lonesome Dove day after day until her death.,1481068800,,411,4.421052631578948

3295337,3,B00116GEJS,"If you love Lonesome Dove (the miniseries) as much as I do, you have probably watched it so many times that you can never watch it again. Because you know every line, every nuance. So you look around for some other vehicle that can get you to that unique place, some other piece of the McCrae-Call saga that will serve.

You know that James Garner can never be Woodrow Call, so you pass over the Streets of Laredo. You keep looking.

And you find Comanche Moon, a prequel which was at least a book written by Larry McMurtry before it became a miniseries directed by Simon Wincer, the very wizard that had directed Lonesome Dove! And in this story you get to see the boys when they were younger, thinking about retirement but still rangering. Yes, here are the younger Gus, Woodrow, and Blue Duck, and Lori's mother Maggie, whom Call would never acknowledge as the mother of his child Newt.

What actors play the two principals, you ask? And how do they fare? Well Steve Zahn plays Gus McCrae. You may know him from Riding in Cars with Boys, and I certainly cherish him for his role in the little-watched film Shattered Glass, in which he plays a reporter who exposes a writer for the New Republic who makes up stories. Steve Zahn, unfortunately, is the reason Comanche Moon falters. Another guy plays Woodrow Call. His name is Karl Urban, and he does better.

The thing about Lonesome Dove is that the main characters had INTELLIGENCE. Augustus was a genuine philosopher with a wonderfully droll outlook and a mystical appreciation of lifes details. Even Woodrow Call, despite his clipped, laborious values and discomfort with the feminine side, had a wickedly sardonic sense of humor, which he often turned on Gus to good effect. And Frederic Forrest as the sadistic rogue Indian, Blue Duck, was an edgy, perceptive character whose sarcasm easily matched that of Captain McCrae.

But in the prequel, not so much. It isn't just because the actors aren't furnished with lines that are as soulful and shrewd  which they definitely arent. (McMurtry seems to have gotten lazy since his greatest novel.) Its also because the actors don't quite know how to be natural. Maybe they are trying too hard to be heroic, like Tom Hanks did in Apollo 13. But give Steve Zahn credit. he comes up with a very passable impression of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae. The mannerisms are there! The problem is not his performance, which is a very good effort: the problem is that Zahn is miscast. As a specimen of the male animal, he simply cant convey the gravitas, danger, glamour, leadership, and warrior intensity that Robert Duvall gave us. Zahn isn't leading man material. We know what Duvall was like when he was young, because we saw him in The Godfather. His role was that of a faithful aide-de-camp, a right-hand man, and we didn't see that he could thrill us as Gus McCrae and make us believe he could ride in like the wrath of God and assassinate a whole troop of wastrels who were holding a young woman hostage and were about to despoil her. But we still saw that he was a force to be reckoned with, a man who held his own with Brando as Vito Corleone.

We do have Val Kilmer though, giving a crazy-good performance as Inish Scull, a sort of monster of military ferocity who is also an eccentric thinker and a fine singer, and who is the leader of the Texas Rangers before he hands off that duty to Call and McCrae and heads out into the wilderness to create a future rescue mission for our heroes. We also have two fine performances by Linda Cardellini as Clara Forsythe, the love of Gus's life, and by the wondrous Elizabeth Banks as the aforementioned Maggie. It's true that Cardellini is no Angelica Huston, but I always felt that that actress was a little too much for her role.

In the background we hear the same kind of stately, sad instrumental music that we recall from Lonesome Dove, whose message is that brave men will go on futile missions where they are as likely as not to get killed, and so the women whom they love will be forced into poverty, sickness, or bad marriages  heartbreak all around, folks. The kind of heartbreak we are partial to!

So, is it worth it? Well, watching Comanche Moon is kind of like being visited by the son of a man you once loved, a man for all seasons who got too old and died, and now his son is in the rocking chair on your porch, sipping beer instead of bourbon, and he is not as bright and not as fiery as his dad, but he does remind you some of the one whom you lost, so the pain in your heart is assuaged just a bit, the pain of missing that great friend.

So I watched Comanche Moon and then damn it, I decided to watch Lonesome Dove again, and one thing I can say is that it never seemed so gleaming and so much fun.",1464307200,12,4761,4.460919540229885

3295378,5,B00116GEJS,Mr. McMurtry surprised me as this book is every bit as good as the first book-Lonesome Dove.

3295391,5,B00116GEJS,"Our Rangers covering the period between ""Dean Man Walking"" and ""Lonesome Dove"".  Kilmer is great as a weird yet savvy leader of the Rangers.  Steve Zahn must have studied Duval to get the right gestures and postures, yet managed to make the role his own.  Karl Urban handled Capt. Call well.  The writers left out the famous Call temper scene - which has been in every other epsidode of this saga.  Speaking of which, Pea Eye Parker is real young here, in Lonesome Dove he appears about 10 years senior,  and in Streets of Laredo he's now 15 years younger, enough to have married Lorena - who became a real b***h - and father 4 children, one who is a pre-teen?  Our Indian antagonists get a little lost. Buffalo Hump here is a chief who looks into his retirement.  In DMW he was a very energetic loner who appeared out of nowhere.  Blue Duck in Comanche is a feisty, young troublemaker.  In Lonesome Dove he's much older yet still a threat.  Mok-mok keeps appearing but really gets little notice until Streets of Laredo.  I guess I'm saying this follows very well in its order and covers major characters that had gotten lost in the other episodes.",1453161600,2,1148,4.519417475728155

This film and Dead Mans Walk were great additions to LD . As for Streets of Laredo ??? Well I think that someone must of kidnapped Larry McMurtry and wrote that without his help .

3295594,5,B00116GEJS,"I'm a huge fan of the Robert Duval / Tommy Lee Jones original miniseries, but I've never read any of the books. I was skeptical when I ran across this movie; how could anyone else play Gus McCrae or Woodrow Call? I was very pleasantly surprised to see that Steve Zahn had adopted the accent and mannerisms that Robert Duval used for the original character. He was entirely believable as young Gus McCrae. Karl Urban did passably well as Woodrow, although he actually looks like a younger Robert Ulrich, so why didn't they cast him as young Jake Spoon? Val Kilmer's character is pretty awesome- he comes across as an oddball at first and his character is certainly eccentric. However, he is gradually revealed to be worthy of the legendary reputation he possesses. It was interesting seeing Woodrow and Maggie, as well as Gus & Clara (the actress playing Clara wasn't as spot on or sharp-tongued as Anjelica Houston). Overall, the production values were excellent, and fans of Westerns will be entirely pleased with this miniseries. The soundtrack isn't quite as moving as the original Lonesome Dove soundtrack, but it's hard for lightning to strike twice.

3295648,5,B00116GEJS,I can watch this movie over and over again. For anyone who has see the original lonesome dove this movie shows you alot that you may not understand about it. Like the town lonesome dove and the Rangerin' days. It is very good I actually like it more than lonesome dove itself but when watched together it fits in perfectly together. The cast could not have played the roles better. Val Kilmer was not in the original but is in Comanche Moon is absolutely fantastic. If you are a western movie buff this is definitely worth a look.,1369440000,,530,4.418367346938775
3295649,3,B00116GEJS,"Larry Mc Murtry's material has been swept into prequels, sequels, exploitequals, etc, so Comanche Moon (I have most of his books and read this one with interest after the original Lonesome Dove TV and book) has always seemed a little contrived and disjointed. Mc Murtry has the awkward position, in a prequel,  of being able to razzle the plot and shape the destiny of the story while being obliged to take great care, honour authenticity and bear a duty to literature in evading and avoiding traps of logic, morals, ethics, common sense and accepted literary traditions. He has an endless inner concept of character and a professional reassessment of the period so that little challenge might be made of details and accuracy. It's a little stilted, a little diluted, a little stiff compared to the public position and reputation of Lonesome Dove. A sequel to Lonesome Dove on TV was thin, sick and weedy. The Dead Man's Walk made for good TV viewing. So is this, and, I'll return to it soon. It's about a three and a halfer now.",1369008000,2,1029,4.716666666666667

3295675,2,B00116GEJS,The story is a prequal to the original story and helps set the stage but is only average in acting and production. It looks like a staged mini series with a somewhat concocted story. As part of the series its worth owning and watching but only once unlike the original which you can watch repeatedly and be rewarded.,1353888000,,316,4.4655172413793105

3295677,4,B00116GEJS,As a big fan of Lonesome Dove I was pleasantly surprised at the production and direction of this TV Movie. As always with the writing of Larry McMurty its dialogue is always a pleasure to listen to. The use of subtitles for the Commance language makes for more realistic characterisations of the native americans. How the actors coped with this problem I do not know but it works. The location filming made it a pleasure to watch on a large plasma screen. Lennie Niehaus's score was up to his usual high standard. Highly recommended.,1353801600,,533,4.680851063829787
3295678,3,B00116GEJS,"It's no surprise Larry McMurtry wrote two prequels to his classic ""Lonesome Dove,"" and only one sequel. The prequels, after all, are able to include the irrepressible Gus McCrae! While nobody will ever beat Robert Duvall's portrayal, both David Arquette in ""Dead Man's Walk"" and Steve Zahn in ""Comanche Moon"" bring him recognizably back to us. He and Captain Call (this time played by Karl Urban) are what draw most fans back to the universe of ""Lonesome Dove"" again and again.

Unfortunately, that universe changes considerably in ""Comanche Moon,"" the action of which takes place in Austin, not Lonesome Dove, despite the original book and miniseries implying otherwise. More significantly, almost everything established about Woodrow's history with Maggie and Newt in ""Lonesome Dove's"" back story is wholly rewritten, and it almost ruins the character of Call. In ""Lonesome Dove,"" he's a man who had a fling with a whore, then felt he was getting in too deep, quit her, and was unwilling to believe the son she bore was his--after all, she was a prostitute--while she drank herself to death. Later, he and Gus took the boy in to raise, but Call could not acknowledge his son.

That's bad enough, especially with both Clara Allen and Gus insisting that the boy is Call's spitting image, but we can understand without condoning. At least he was no deadbeat dad. He fed and raised and protected the boy. His failures hurt us, but they rarely enraged us.

In ""Comanche Moon,"" Maggie is played by the very likable Elizabeth Banks. She and Call are pretty much living together for quite some time, including *during* her pregnancy. Her love for him shows through in her every word and glance. Still, he refuses to marry her over the *years* that she is raising Newt as a single mother, despite that he continues to visit with her and she turns her life around and becomes a respectable shop girl whom everyone in town apparently loves. A whore-turned-respectable-shop girl is as unlikely as a whore-turned-schoolteacher (see: ""Streets of Laredo""). Still, that's what we're shown, and Call's moral paralysis over so much time turns him into someone it's difficult not to despise.

""Comanche Moon"" also includes McMurtry's increasingly heavy reliance on ""quirky"" characters--this time the Scull couple--and time spent with the Native Americans, which thankfully did not dominate the original ""Lonesome Dove,"" as well as his usual fascination with torture and rape. There's plenty of shoot-em-up action and frontier humor. If I had never seen ""Lonesome Dove,"" I might give ""Comanche Moon"" 4 instead of 3 stars. It's great to see Gus and Call again. Their adventures as Texas Rangers remain entertaining. But their romantic escapades, on which ""Comanche Moon"" focuses, are ultimately disappointing.",1345161600,,2790,5.1118421052631575

I still don't know exactly what a gaffer does.  One of the most curious credits for me is ""casting"".  I always thought the directors and/or producers did the casting.  When I see interviews with movie people and they tell the stories about how they became involved in a project, I've NEVER heard the story ""well, this casting director called me...""

The reason I'm spending all this time talking about casting is that in many decades of movie and television viewing, this is the first time I actually had the thought ""the casting for this film is absolutely TERRIBLE.""

The blessing - and the curse - of all of the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lonesome-Dove/dp/B0018PH3L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lonesome Dove</a>"" films is that they will all be compared to the original, an icon that ranks high on frequently produced ""best ever"" lists of both mini-series and westerns.  In the original Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones gave definitive performances as Augustus ""Gus"" McCrae and Woodrow Call in the first of the Lonesome Dove stories written by Larry McMurtry.  The original cast was rounded out by Robert Urich as Jake Spoon, Angelica Huston as Clara, and Danny Glover as Deets.

Naysayers will say ""this wasn't SUPPOSED to be Lonesome Dove, and THIS cast was only giving their own performance from McMurtry's source material"" or something of the like.

Poppycock.

In the same way that I can't adequately suspend my disbelief in biographical films unless the actor achieves some reasonable facsimile of the original (such as Helen Mirren in her Oscar-winning turn as Queen Elizabeth II) I also can't enjoy a film with different actors cast in familiar roles unless they do an adequate job ""making it their own.""  It seems a little unfair to report that Steve Zahn is no Robert Duvall.  I give him some credit for even trying.  Karl Urban would have been spectacular in this film - as Jake Spoon.  I would ask the gentle reader to compare not only photos of Mr. Urban and Mr. Urich, but if you decide to watch this film - compare the performances of the two as well.  It is so unsettling - the effect is as if Jake Spoon decided just prior to commencement of filming ""I'm kinda TIRED of bein' Jake Spoon.  You know whut, Woodrow?  I think I'm a-gonna be YOU fer a spell.""

As I said - I don't know exactly the jobs of people who get casting credits - but it seems that if you have an actor available who can duplicate a major character in a role reprisal, you have done the work and the audience a disservice if you cast this actor in a different role.  Among the thousands of SAG members they couldn't find a single person who could suggest the appearance and mannerisms of Tommy Lee Jones as Woodrow?  (Too bad that Jonny Lee Miller must have been busy doing ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eli-Stone-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B001ASIHZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eli Stone: The Complete First Season</a>"" instead of being available to try the part again as he did in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Larry-McMurtry-s-Dead-Man-s-Walk/dp/B00368PSKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Larry McMurtry's Dead Man's Walk</a>."")

All of the above would be bad enough, but the writing (both plot and dialogue) and acting are across the board a substantial step backwards from any previous ""Lonesome Dove"" incarnation.  I would only recommend this for Lonesome Dove devotees who absolutely have to view every frame ever filmed about Gus and Woodrow.",1295308800,4,3716,5.197986577181208
3295696,4,B00116GEJS,"I've just purchase the entire movie series, Dead mans walk, Comanche Moon, Lonesome Dove, Return to Lonesome Dove and The Streets of Laredo. Originally I did not appreciate Dead mans walk. Johnny Lee Miller as Capt Woodrow F Call was very good. He captured the intense persona of the character. However David Arquette as Capt Augustus McCrae was very under whelming. He was poorly cast and I was expecting more. I could see none of the characteristics that would illustrate to me, that this guy would be the heroic ""Gus"" from Lonesome Dove.

With that being said. Comanche Moon is a different animal altogether. First lets start with the casting. The principle actors Steve Zahn as Augustus McCrae and Karl Urban as Woodrow F Call were spot on. Personally I believe that it is easy for a halfway decent actor to portray Captain Call because he is such an emotionally pent up guy. And I'm not trying to minimize Tommy Lee Jones because I'm not. He made that character. But I feel as though any actor who portray Augustus would have to address a broader range of emotions. But with Captain Call all that an actor has to do is show very little emotion. However Steve Zahn is a marvel! He perfectly captured the mannerisms that Robert Duvall introduce to this character. Just watch his voice inflection's and hand gesture's and mannerisms, that's Gus!! This film would not have worked if Zahn would not have done his home work with this character. Comanche Moon focused on both of the main characters quite often. However this film was really a character study on Augustus McCrae. In the very same way that ""Dead Man's Walk"" was a character study on Captain Call.

The rest of the cast was fine, but I don't want to fake it! It's really about Call and Gus! Having Simon Wincer to return as the director was fantastic. However each episode did not end with the exciting punch that concluded each one of his previous Lonesome Dove episodes from the original mini series. In those episodes, each show had a dramatic ""punch"" that caused you to want to see the next one. I remember watching the first episode from the mini series on a cold February Sunday in 1989. When the series began, I never thought that I would be sitting and watching the entire mini series. But after viewing episode 1# and the way that it ended,I was hooked!

And the musical score was minor to say the least. The Lonesome Dove was scored by Basil Poledouris. His melodies where haunting to say the least. Listen to ""On the trail"" During the long Wagon train trail march in the harsh terrain from the first Lonesome Dove. That melody has stayed with me for 21 years. However, as much as I love Comanche Moon, the film suffers from a poor musical score. The original series clearly illustrate that a compelling score is just as important as casting good actors.

To conclude, Comanche Moon is very good! It's better than Dead Man's Walk. But Dead Man's walk had a better sound track. I highly recommend that you purchase these films. And if you've never seen them before? Then I envy you, because you have the pleasure of watching them all, for the first time. Lucky you.

After ordering more movies, sometimes out of order I finally got them all. Here is the list according to order if you want to watch the story from beginning to end.

#1...Dead Man's Walk
#2...Comanche Moon
#3...Lonesome Dove
#4...Return To Lonesome Dove
#5...Lonesome Dove The Series
#6...Lonesome Dove The Outlaw Years
#7...Streets Of Loredo

A few years pass between Comanche Moon and Lonesome Dove. Lonesome Dove & Return To Lonesome Dove are like watching one movie. It picks up right where Lonesome Dove left off. In my opinion the best two movies of the seven, although all are worth watching.
Lonesome Dove The Outlaw Years has the same charactors, but it is 22 episods. It reminded me a bit like Gunsmoke, the same town, the same people, but a different story each week. They are all good, just not a continous story. If you watch all 7 movies you will have approx. 60 hours of entertainment. Very enjoyable, and you will feel like you're back in the 1980's. There are so many different charactors and so much happens, I plan on watching it over again many times. You will follow the lives of Gus McCrea & Woodrow Call. It is quite addicting. You will enjoy each movie and wanting more.
The only complaint is there is a few things left un resolved. It's almost like there should have been a few more movies to tell the entire story.
I highly recommend these movies.

3295703,4,B00116GEJS,"I put off watching this because I had been disappointed with the book's major sub-plot involving torture. It's still there in the video, but it's downplayed and makes more sense somehow. Val Kilmer does a great job playing the torture-ee and making the point that the character is challenged to try new experiences at any cost.

The movie has a really superb look and attention to detail. For example the rangers are always with the correct firearms, going from what I think is a Sharps rifle to the Winchester ""Yellowboy"" between the late '50s and late '60s. The history is pretty accurate too, from what I've read on the subject. Buffalo Hump really did lead a Comanche raid to the Gulf and Charles Goodnight was one of the Rangers who ""rescued"" Cynthia Ann Parker, saying exactly what he said in the video. However, Quanah and Peta Nakona hanging out together is not so accurate. I believe current thinking is that Peta Nakona was killed when Quanah was 12 years old by Sul Ross, future governor of Texas (which is a pretty interesting story in itself).

The leads do a pretty good job. The difference in heights between Woodrow and Gus is a little weird, but they capture the mannerisms and vocals pioneered by Duval and Jones and they look pretty macho. The action is pretty cool with nice riding and shooting and some creative camera angles. So, I'd say not as good as Lonesome Dove, but worth watching. If you haven't seen any of the four mini-series I'd recommend going chronological, which would be - Dead Man's Walk - Comanche Moon - Lonesome Dove - Streets of Laredo. I'd also highly recommend the books, and just about every other book written by McMurtry.",1279065600,,1668,4.689419795221843

3295713,5,B00116GEJS,"""Commanche Moon"", is a fairly interesting prequel to ""Lonsome Dove"", which I think most LD fans will appreciate.

While Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call as played by Steve Zahn and Karl Urban may take some getting used to, by the film's conclusion, the actors are firmly established as their characters.  Zahn does a great job of portraying the McCrae character as fleshed out by Robert Duvall, but anytime he would be situated next to Urban, I found myself wishing that someone had put him on a soap box or something, to add a few inches.

Karl Urban as Call was as wooden as the Tommy Lee Jones Call, but Val Kilmer as Captain Inish Scull is great.  I was a little surpised at how well the film followed the book in how this character, and his antagonists were true to McMurty's vision.

If you're looking for answers to your questions about ""Lonesome Dove"", ""Commanche Moon"" pretty well illustrates the prior exploits of most of the LD characters and the reasons for their actions.  Buffalo Hump and son, Blue Duck are well represented. Maggie Tilton is only part of the dialogue in ""Lonsome Dove"", but in ""Commanche Moon"", her relationship to Call is far more expanded and explained, especially in comparison to the earlier ""Dead Man's Walk"".

Even more revealing, ""Commanche Moon"" also goes into some detail concerning the prior exploits of Jake Spoon and his relationship to McCrae and Call.  ""Don't take up with any hoodlums.  We'd hate to have to hang you,"" is something spoken to Spoon by McCrae towards the end of the film that is said in jest, but LD fans will be able to immediately pick up on the irony.

Like ""Lonsome Dove"", there were various points where I, as a viewer, thought that the story could end, but then surprisingly, the story continued.  Therefore, when the end of ""Commanche Moon"" finally did come, it was sort of a surprise.  The good thing about the ending itself is that it is an apt lead-in to ""Lonesome Dove"", which, timeline-wise, begins only about ten years later.

""Commanche Moon"" isn't a great film, like ""Lonesome Dove"", but it's a very good one, and I think, a better addition to the LD series than ""Dead Man's Walk"" or ""The Streets of Laredo"".

I've given it five stars because it doesn't need to great to be enjoyable, and I really enjoyed ""Commanche Moon"".",1238630400,31,2295,4.662531017369727

3295717,3,B00116GEJS,"I thought this recent TV miniseries was okay but a far cry from ""Lonesome Dove, ""  as it was being compared since it is a prequel to that famous story.

""Commanche Moon"" is definitely worth a watch for any fan of westerns. Just don't expect it to be as intense as ""Lonesome Dove."" Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play aren't as strong.  Some say it's unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison but you have to compare it - it's the story of the same two leading Texas Ranger characters: ""Woodrow Call"" and ""Gus McCrae.""

The main difference, I found, was that this prequel is a lot of slower and more relational (the two Rangers and their women) at times. Yet, I didn't mind that because the two main women were pretty ladies and likable people. They were played nicely by Linda Cardelini (""Clara Forsythe"") and Elizabeth Banks (""Maggie.""). They helped make this long movie palatable.  Maggie's son ""Newt"" was a wonderful kid, too - the kind of boy every parent would want.

The most interesting character, I thought, turned out to be ""Inish Scull,"" played by Val Kilmer. As in the western film, ""Tombstone,"" Kilmer almost steals the show from the leads. ""Scull"" is really an original, if I ever saw one: a strange dude, indeed.

Actually, all of the supporting actors in here did a fine job, from Keith Robinson's ""Deets"" to Wes Studi as ""Buffalo Hump."" I always find Studi to be fascinating, no matter what role he plays. I wish he had had a bigger role in this miniseries.

One thing this film has in common with ""Lonesome Dove"" and other good westerns: the scenery and photography. It's just beautiful at times and is a joy to watch. We also have an excellent director of this film: Simon Wincer.

3295722,5,B00116GEJS,"Back in the 1840's the State Texas was known as the Texas Republic, a harsh environment where several cultures clashed: Apache and Comanche, Anglos and Hispanics, for the most part, Mexicans. The battle over land, water and resources was furious, the spirit of these men as they set out to conquer, indomitable. The Texas Rangers were members of a law enforcement agency that investigated crimes from murder to political corruption, tracking fugitives and forging most important events in Texas history.

In their early days, the Texas Rangers protected the frontier against Indian attacks on settlers, then serving as scouts, spies, couriers, and guides for those wishing to settle in the West. These men were trained to aim, fire and reload their weapons from horseback, an amazing development from the usual technique of dismounting before shooting at enemies and reloading.

This is the second installment to a trilogy centered on the lives of two men, Augustus ""Gus"" McCrae, played by Steve Zahn and Woodrow Call, played by Karl Urban.

Comanche Moon presents the Rangers, now serving under an eccentric character played by Val Kilmer, working to protect the territories against the Comanches. Buffalo Hump, played by Wes Studi, and his son Blue Duck, played by Adam Beach.

We see the men falling in love, with Call playing the role of a quiet, introspective and isolative man who does not know how to understand and therefore, handle women, get involved with a prostitute who bears him a son. McRae falls in love with the store owner's daughter, Clara, but because his style of life is not to be depended upon, they never make it to marriage.

Zahn did a decent job as Gus McRae (you can tell he had studied Duvall's  portrayal of the character and tried to get down the technique, and while not perfect, it wasn't bad) - but most of the other actors literally sounded like they were reading right from the script. Urban was really a terrible W.F.Call, and while I thought West Studi was good as Famous Shoes in Streets of Laredo, he didn't seem to fit the role of Buffalo Hump in this one, not at all. Val Kilmer was absolutely awful as Inish Scull. Instead of giving the impression he was a tough, if slightly eccentric Yankee-in-Texas, he came across as a clown.

I noticed Halmark/Artisan didn't produce this one as they did the others in the series (which were all better - I'd rank them in this order as the best to least: Lonesome Dove, Streets of Laredo, Dead Man's Walk) and I don't know if that had something to do with it, but this was pretty bad.

3295730,5,B00116GEJS,"This is a simply outstanding made-for-television movie about the lives of Texas Rangers Augustus McRae and Woodrow F. Call.  Although it the second part of the four-part series and was filmed last, it is every bit as good as its predecessor (Dead Man's Walk) and almost as good as its successor (Lonesome Dove).  The complete story finishes with Streets of Laredo.  One of the most interesting parts is the depiction of the state capital, Austin, in its early years.  Additionally, what makes all four movies of the series so compelling is the character development of the main characters, so that it is not just a ""shoot 'em up"" with a lot of action but no story to tell, but rather, a tale that leaves you wanting to know what happens to Gus and Woodrow in the next stage.  I highly recommend this to Texans, peace officers, and anyone else who loves the Old West.",1210723200,,866,4.597402597402597
3295731,4,B00116GEJS,"Finally we have the last chapter in the lonesome dove saga
after years of supposed adaptations of Larry mcmurtry's final lonesome dove tale to close out and link up the middle years of McCrae,Call and cronies. Simon Wincer
the original miniseries director has returned to bookend
the series and does an estimable job, while not on the scale of the original , Wincer talkles amuch broader canvas especially in regard to the comanche who at the time  were still quite able to vigourasously defend their culture and territory. Val Kilmer as Inish Skull has been critized as portraying the eccentric ranger leader as over the top when in fact scull is exactly that as created by McMurtry. Kilmer seems to enjoy the character as is a off the radar contrast to most of the main characters. In Dead Man's Walk Woodrow Call recieved a bit more story time at least in character building while in Comanche MOON Augustus McCrae is given substantive screen time via Steve Zahn to project the beloved ranger
we have come to know throughout the series. In Comanche
Moon zahn's gus is his ownand does succeed in bringing
a familiar character with his own nuances recognizable
but new. Karl Urban also succeed's but in a lesser degree
but he has less to work with as Call's make up has been
established in previous stories what Urban has left is aman who is in pain for being who heis and pain in being unable to truly embrace a future with a woman he clearly loves and who desperately loves him . His dedication to
keeping the Texas republic safe and his friendship with gus are his only respite. Ryan Merriman is miscast as
 Jake Spoon and in fact is given even less to do than in the novel. Wes Studi is probably the most talented of native actors today  and brings a dignity of character and
time to his portrayal of Buffalo Hump. Technically i do not think ,however he was the proper choice for Buffalo Hump. Though aging the comanche apearance should be closer though older to Eric Schweig's in Dead Man's Walk
an actor like Steve Reevis who actually has a the role of worm or Gil Birmingham from Into the West  i would have prefered tom keep in line with previous versions though
if any of these actors could match studi's acting chops
is debatable. Jonathan Joss is wasted as he is hardly seen inthe miniseries as kicking wolf a major adversary of the rangers. Linda Cardenilli does afine job as Clara
andin fact brings in such more to the characterv that could be expected, the character of Maggie Tilton ,always
heard of and seen for a few scenes in Dead Man's Walk now comes to the fore  and MS. Banks work is admirable and tragic to watch. The locations are used wonderfully  filmed in New Mexico  and used to the greatest effect.
My Rewiew is apostive review with resevations regarding some casting and the much of the story edited out from
novel ,some of which has been restored in the dvd .
Part 1 moves along slowly with thoughts of a dis appointing adaptation,however that changes soon and the next chapters depicted reaffirm this western as a fine
sweeping ,exciting, tale . while again not 1989's lonesome dove or even Dead Man's Walk it is finally
 a welcome version of a saga long awaited for to close out

If producers are inclined to sink large amounts of cash into any made for TV movie, my advice is to do homework first and determine if the investment is wise.  The investment in COMANCHE MOON was most unwise.  Weak acting, weak dialogue, weak story are the result of a weak screenplay.  I was sooo bored with this production, dialogue, and romance scenes that I kept fast forwarding the play to find some action and ""true grit.""

I have to agree with most of the other reviews-the ensemble cast-while hosting several A-Listers-was too heavy on the bad acting side to make the multiple hour investment worthwhile.  While Val Kilmer and Steve Zahn do make valiant efforts to ""get it right"", the biggest disappointment was Carl Urban's.

Urban-who has the looks of a young Tommy Lee Jones-was too wooden and his southern accent was bad and even nonexistant in some parts.  This was a disappointment as I have liked Urban in other films, but it's looking like he may be a ""one trick pony"", ala Schwarzenegger and Vin Diesel.

The feminine side of the ensemble were the films downfall.  Griffiths was too caricature, Cardellini too comedic and high pitched and Banks-the most appropriate as Newts mom Maggie-was given literally nothing to work with-unfortunate since Maggie plays such a vital role post mortem in LD.

Commanche Moon could have been so much more, instead it's like visiting an old friend and wondering what drew you to them in the first place.  My advice-keep the beauty of Lonesome Dove without letting Commanche Moon spoil it.

Lonesome Dove, the novel and the miniseries, were as classic as classic gets. The Novel is one of the only books that I've ever read more than once. And the miniseries adaptation is just as memorable. The miniseries starred Robert Duvall as Augustus McCrae, Tommy Lee Jones as Woodrow Call, Rick Schroder as Newt, Diane Lane as Lorena Wood, Danny Glover as Joshua Deets, Robert Urich as Jake Spoon and Anjelica Huston as Clara Allen. What a line up of A-listers giving A-list performances. Duvall and Jones absolutely nailed the characters created by McMurtry in the novel. And Director Simon Wincer really preserved the integrity of the novel.

Streets of Laredo and Dead Man's Walk were good books, and adapted to fair-at-best miniseries. So when I saw that Comanche Moon was coming to CBS as the final book adaptation miniseries in January 2008, I was not that excited. But I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. Comanche Moon was a very good book and the miniseries was equally satisfying.

In Comanche Moon we find McCrae and Call as Texas Rangers as the Civil War is ending. They aren't involved in the Civil War as much as they are still battling the Comanches as well the cruel and diabolical bandit Ahumado. Val Kilmer is Captain Skull, and together with Gus, Woodrow and some other rangers they head out to the plains to get the bad guys.

There's a good amount of violence in some sequences, but some of the brutalities in the book have been tamed down for TV. (I.e. in the book Captain Skull's eyelids are removed by one of Ahumado's henchmen as a form of torture; that treatment is completely removed from the TV series.)

The miniseries producers did a smart thing: They brought back Wincer in the director's chair. And he once again brought a McMurtry novel to life with class and integrity. Comanche Moon (the novel or the miniseries) is no classic like Lonesome Dove was, but it was highly entertaining and enjoyable. However, like the last third of the novel, the Comanche Moon miniseries comes to grueling slow-down (in part 3 of the 3-part series). But it didn't take away from the enjoyment of watching Gus, Call and their crew as young, Pre-Lonesome Dove Texas Rangers looking for their place in life and trying to preserve life for others.

Steve Zahn is Gus McCrae and Karl Urban is Woodrow Call. They clearly read the book, watched the first miniseries and got some terrific direction from Director Wincer; they really captured the essence of their characters. And Val Kilmer should get an award for his portrayal of Captain Skull. There are some other popular (TV) actors in Comanche Moon, and they all combine to give us a very good CBS miniseries based on a very good book.

If you missed Comanche Moon on TV and you liked Lonesome Dove, you'll find this DVD quite enjoyable...with no commercials. Oh, and just how did the town of Lonesome Dove get its name?...Well, you'll just have to add this DVD to yer cart to find that out, pards.",1202169600,192,4466,6.1312

3295761,3,B00116GEJS,"We all miss Bill Wittliff. He was the writer on the teleplay on LONESOME DOVE, and did a masterful job of bringing Larry McMurtry's book come alive on the screen. I have read all four books of the Lonesome Dove epic and have  seen all of the TV adaptations.

Like other reviewers I was looking forward to COMMANCHE MOON on TV. It was a wonderful read, with great characters, such as the Skulls. But unless I was dozing during the second episode, none of that seemed to lead anywhere.

The New York Times was in my opinion a bit harsh calling the roles of Gus and Woodrow miscast. I think they did their best to mimic how these characters would have acted 15 years earlier in their lives. They did their best to inform the development of the characters over the years. But the reality is that Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones made these roles impossible to follow.

I was surprised that McMurtry who is generally very careful in his research chose to stage a Commanche raid on Austin, especially when there actually was one on Galveston, that was the whole point of what Bear Hump was talking about in ""driving to the sea.""

3295763,3,B00116GEJS,"A few years back I stumbled onto a used copy of the book, COMANCHE MOON, on sale at my local library.  I bought it, eagerly read it, thoroughly enjoyed it and anxiously awaited what I assumed would be the inevitable excellent television release of the final film installment of the LONESOME DOVE saga.

Now that the movie version of the book has been released, it's time to sort things out. First the good things.

Simon Wincer, the director of the original LONESOME DOVE, is back with this video prequel. Wincer's eye is evident everywhere here as he paints panorama after panorama of a gorgeous western landscape. Wincer has become the consummate modern Western director and proves it again here.

There are some wonderful surprises in the cast. At first I was skeptical about casting Steve Zahn in the role of Augustus McCrae.  I assumed that Zahn, an actor famous for his airheaded portrayals of every character he has played, wouldn't have the ability to arise to a role defined, originally by the inimitable Robert Duvall.  But as the miniseries played out I found Zahn to be, not only believable in the role, but also extremely credible and charming. It was easy to see him as a young Duvall or, more to the point, a young McCrae.

Karl Urban does an equally fine job of portraying a young Woodrow Call. He's dry and straightforward, all business, with a stern approach to McMurtry's famous hero.  Moreover, the chemistry between Urban and Zahn is just what it should be.

We get a brief glimpse of Maggie Tilton's tragic character in DEAD MAN'S WALK.  COMANCHE MOON develops her, as she becomes a key figure in the LONESOME DOVE story. Here Elizabeth Banks does a wonderful job of portraying a woman of feeling and tenderness, one who rises above the horrible life of a frontier whore, seeking a life of respectability but not apologizing for what she has had to be in order to survive.

McMurtry is famous for including an array of nutty characters that bring an air of comedy as well as insanity to his works.  This is especially true of his LONESOME DOVE quartet.  In COMANCHE MOON the main players fitting this description are Inish and Inez Scull, portrayed, respectively, by Val Kilmer and Rachel Griffiths.  The book is replete with the adventures of these two, describing their doings and what is done to them, especially on the part of Kilmer's character, Inish.  And sadly, for me, the miniseries falls unforgivably short, and I am not blaming Kilmer or Griffiths, when it comes to the Sculls.  Yes, it may be that the TV medium wouldn't allow an accurate and graphic portrayal of what befalls Inish in the book (even though there is plenty of gore in Ahumado's encampment).  Yes, it may be that Inez's antics were equally racy and, therefore, the stuff that ended up on the cutting room floor.  But, frankly, I was surprised that McMurtry, being a co-writer on the project, would allow the whitewashed portrayal of these two that ensues in the movie. Accordingly, a star is, of necessity lost for skimping here.

An additional star has to be lost for the weakness of the remaining cast, a bumbling bunch that is so unbelievable that the story is nearly lost. Many are misportrayals of various key characters. McMurtry's Blue Duck, portrayed masterfully in the original LONESOME DOVE by Frederic Forrest, is the personification of evil and carries the half-breed chip on his shoulder with sinister accuracy.  In COMANCHE MOON, Adam Beach, though a fine actor in his own right, is far too Indian to be believable as a half-breed and falls considerably short of Forrest's portrayal.

A weak three stars for me. Yes, it completes the set and is a necessary watch for any follower of LONESOME DOVE. But COMANCHE MOON could have been far better.  It's as though McMurtry simply succumbed to the temptation to get this one out of the way and pocket his money and, so, skimped on the details that made LONESOME DOVE the classic that it remains in the Western genre.

Most of Lonesome Dove's appeal in movie form was due to the great actors, Tommy Lee Jones is Woodrow Call, no one will ever play that part like he did.  Gus is Robert Duvall, and no one will ever play that part as well as he did.  However I thought these actors Steve Zahn and Karl Urban did a fairly good job at playing the parts.  It is a hard act to follow, and they definitely did a better job then any other actors I have seen in any of the other Lonesome Dove series after the original.  Watching the others, dead mans walk, streets of laredo, return to lonesome dove, was just uncomfortable watching the actors trying to portray the characters that Tommy lee Jones and Robert Duvall brought to life on the screen.

 I will defnitely buy this movie to add to my lonesome dove collection.  To the review that said it wasn't historically accurate, it is a fictional series of books, not a historical one.",1201219200,3,1270,4.361702127659575
3295765,5,B00116GEJS,"I think this was an excellent prequel to Lonesome Dove!  Granted... IT IS NOT LONESOME DOVE.  They will never top that series... or even match it... who even expects it?  When I say Steve Zahn playing Gus I thought, ""This is going to be terrible!  How did they select him?"", but I was plesantly surprized!  He was excellent as Gus... mimicing Duval I thought was great... irritating... not at all... this was a young Gus, just as I would have expected him to be.  Steve did an excellent job!  I did expect a little more from Karl.  He could have opened up a little more, studied the character Call a little more.  I just didn't find much in his character other than being stiff.  The other characters:  Deets, Pea Eye, and Jake Spoon where not developed in detail, but it did make connection... it was a short series.  Maybe if it were as long as Lonesome Dove...  Technically correct... probably not, but you can be just as critical to most all movies.  I will certainly add it to my collection as it fills the gap.  I do wish it were longer or that they would add another series prior to Lonesome Dove for further character development.  I loved Val Kilmer's role, but I wished they would have developed or explored Gus and Calls' relationship with him more.  His character was weird, but I suppose that he was a source lending to their qualities and his wife supporting Gus as a playboy.",1201046400,6,1390,4.47410358565737
3295766,3,B00116GEJS,"I waited with increasing anticipation for this miniseries, and I must say, I was a little let down.  Only a little though.  It was nowhere near as bad as some of these reviews say (and I must say, being from Austin, there are parts of this city that ARE near-deserts) but it is also not as good as the original.  It is, however, BY FAR the best of the other ""Lonesome Dove"" movies.  I hated ""Return to Lonesome Dove"" enough to sour my impression of the original until I bought the DVD and remembered why I loved it in the first place.  The best part of this prequel by far was Steve Zahn's interpretation of Gus.  He had all of Robert Duval's mannerisms down and I felt that this prequel added significantly to the personal tragedy that ""followed"" in the original.  A worthwhile watch (especially for Zahn) and an improvement, despite the historical inaccuracies, over anything with the ""Lonesome Dove"" tag on it since the original.",1200960000,4,932,4.578313253012048
3295767,5,B00116GEJS,"This is the second part, fourth to be presented (I do not count the pathetic, not enough words to describe how bad it was, non-McMurtry ""Return to Lonesome Dove"" as a part) in the Lonesome Dove series.  The book and the mini-series are simply is not as good as Lonesome Dove.  That said, it is certainly not as bad as many here have said.  A consistent criticism seems to be the odd story lines, such as with Capt. Scull and his never completed climax with Ahumado.  Like it or dislike it, odd twists are staples of McMurtry writing.  You're not going to see them dueling in the middle of Main Street.  Having the arch villain bitten by a spider is much more likely in McMurtry's world.

Steve Zahn does a good job mimicking Robert Duvall's Augustus McCrae.  Some pan this and others like it.  I find myself in the latter camp.  When all is said and done, they are playing the character and trying to maintain some consistency.  For that matter, David Arquette played Duvall playing McCrae in Dead Man's Walk as well.  After Duvall's fantastic portrayal of Gus in Lonesome Dove, we wouldn't want Gus to act like Clint Eastwood.  And while Karl Urban plays a stiff Woodrow Call, Call was stiff.  That was the point of his character.  If he wasn't, he would have married Maggie, Gus wouldn't have kept going off rangering and married Clara, and there wouldn't be a story to tell.

Note that the story is NOT about the Comanches.  Hence, although they provide the driving force behind the story, the Comanche characters do not have as many lines or as much face-time on screen.  While the Comanche story would be one I would like to see, the Lonesome Dove series doesn't tell it.  If it did, the series would be called ""Palo Duro,"" not ""Lonesome Dove.""

On the bright side, the story is an interesting one full of twists, despite having to fill in between a known beginning and known ending.  It is not Lonesome Dove, but that is hard to expect.",1200960000,6,1942,4.522988505747127

Zahn did perfect!  urban descant not so great but the movie i love and will watch countless times.  i admit they didn't devolop deets, jake, and peaye enough but we still got  a taste.  i will cherish this movie.. im a true fan i can quote almost every line from begining to end in the orignal i won't listne to trash talk from people who don't know anything....great movie, true fans buy and enjoy!",1200873600,,872,4.262195121951219
3295769,1,B00116GEJS,"Lonesome Dove is probably my favorite western movie of all time.  I really enjoy all western movies and can always find a scene, character, or message that makes them enjoyable.  Commanche Moon is the exception.  It is the first western I have seen that I can't say anything good about. It appeared the story plot around the character Skull was going to be entertaining, but that to was a disappointment, ending abruptly and strangely. I recorded the mini-series on DVD when it aired on tv but am not going to keep it in my collection.",1200873600,10,535,4.610526315789474
