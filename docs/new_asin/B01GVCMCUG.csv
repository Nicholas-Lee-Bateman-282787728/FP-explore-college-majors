8763626,4,B01GVCMCUG,"I was delighted to be able to get this CD.  However beware!  It came from Germany and would not play on an American player, so I
had to find someone with the equipment to copy it.  It does have English subtitles. It  is an excellent film, and the dancing is wonderful
as expected, although as is true of many dance documentaries only clips of dances are shown, so it left me badly wanting to see an
entire dance - from start to finish.",1491091200,3,435,4.204819277108434

8763628,5,B01GVCMCUG,It has English subtitles which was my main concern. You just have to go through the set up when you begin the video. It is in the middle column. Wonderful documentary.,1483315200,3,167,4.419354838709677
