6425822,5,B00KGLE3KG,"Amazon and Nick have finally answered their fans and put the 2nd season of Rugrats, in its entirety, on DVD, just in time for the 10th anniversary of the series finale episodes, (The entire 9th and last season is also on DVD!) which debuted in June 2004 with the last episodes of fellow Nicktoons, Hey Arnold! and The Wild Thornberrys. Aside from the whole 9th season, no other season set of Rugrats contains FBI/DHS Warnings on every show, OR just once via the Play All options. All 26 shows contain the show's themes at the time, including the special one for The Santa Experience. That and the remaining 12 shows on discs 3 and 4 contain a modern Nickelodeon jingle to start them off, especially to let you know these weren't on DVD sets like this before, or on DVD period. What's more, all 4 discs are dual-layered DVD-R discs, just like with season 9's 2 discs, and every episode contains closed-captioning in both new sets. Sadly, no other extras are in here nor in any other season set. Starting here, the series was achieving the familiar look many of us came to expect with Rugrats, not being as rough as season 1 looks, having added music and/or dialogue during the end credits, and being a smash hit on Nick with kids AND ""growed ups"". This season also marked the first real appearances of Angelica's ""bossy"" mother Charlotte, the Carmichaels, especially Susie, and Aunt Miriam. There's a bonanza of adventures in this set alone; 51 to be exact, season 3's the same way! If you're wanting to have the entire 2nd season of Rugrats and not the ""best-of"" set, go right ahead and get it, if you get a chance! All 9 whole season sets are under $20 each when I typed this, so what're you waiting for? (Unless you already have them all.) What kind of nut would wanna pay thousands of bucks to get just one DVD or Blu-ray set?! Just get the whole enchilada and save yourselves tons of dough, it's worth every penny!

6425826,5,B00KGLE3KG,So glad that Nickelodeon/Amazon made it right by releasing the COMPLETE season 2! I now have every episode of Rugrats on DVD and I couldn't be happier.,1401148800,,151,4.62962962962963
6425827,5,B00KGLE3KG,"I'll skip reviewing the show, because you obviously like it if you're checking out the listing for this 20-year-old cartoon, and focus on the DVD.

This is, indeed, the entire second season spread out over four discs... finally. I'm surprised it took Amazon so long to make this available. I don't know if it was an issue at Amazon's end, or Nickelodeon's end, but this is better late than never.

The first thing I noticed about this set was that it only has four discs (I was expecting six like the season 3 set). They managed to fit everything that was in the old season 2 set (later renamed the ""Best of Season 2"") onto the first two discs of this one, along with the Christmas episode. The rest of the season is on the final two discs.

Another thing I noticed about this set that was different from every other Amazon Nicktoon set I've bought, is the inclusion of the opening theme in front of every episode! I've bought all of Amazon's Doug sets, their Hey Arnold! sets (back when Amazon offered them before Shout! Factory got the rights), and the first three Rugrats sets, and with all of those, they only had the opening theme play at the start of the disc once and then the episodes would follow (with end credits still intact). I know nothing about the technical aspect of making these, but I'm thinking maybe a new method of manufacturing was developed that allowed for enough space on a disc to fit more episodes AND include the opening theme in front of every one. The video and sound quality of each episode did NOT suffer because of this either.

I highly recommend this, as it's the complete season 2 that we've been waiting five years for, the picture and sound quality is great, and (of course) this was back when the show was in its heyday and is still enjoyable today.",1401148800,34,1789,4.478527607361963

6425830,5,B00KGLE3KG,I don't mean to write a review but has anyone seen the new listing for season 2 I'm wondering if it's the complete season. If you read the description very carefully they say it's the complete second season with All 26 episodes. Can someone get back at me about this,1400889600,,266,4.34
6425831,2,B00KGLE3KG,"When they showed that they had the whole season 2, I was very excited. I thought they redid it. They even showed that they were going to have 4 disc, and that all the episodes from season 2 were on there. It feels like I've been cheated. I had to cancell season 9, because even though it looked like that was going to be the complete season 9, I knew it was the best of before. The worst part is, I already donated my other best of season 2 DVD, so I can't send this one back. Thanks alot!!!",1400716800,,491,3.9696969696969697
6425832,5,B00KGLE3KG,"I have loved the Rugrats since I was an actual little rugrat. I have loved this show since I was about 2 1/2 - Oh Nickelodeon! How I miss the days of quality cartoons. I now have seasons: 2, 6,7 & 9. I need seasons 1,3,4,5 & 8 to complete the original series. I am going to purchase the spin-off series: All-Grown Up; it was very cute. This was one of Nick's longest running cartoons (being surpassed now by the odious Spongebob Squarepants - I didn't like that show as a 9 year old and I do not like it now) the 1990's Nickelodeon had an amazing roster of shows and this was one of them. There aren't any special features of anything like that on the DVD sets it is just the episodes and that is okay - but honestly it would have been nice to have some extras.",1489622400,,761,4.08

6425881,4,B00KGLE3KG,"I received the complete season 2 of Rugrats on DVD as a Christmas present this year, and I have to say, an excellent season! It features 26 episodes on a 4 disc set, which include several favorites of mine, such as Mirrorland, Reptar on Ice, Super Hero Chuckie, Feeding Hubert, and Spike the Wonder Dog.

I did notice something though. I also have seasons 1, 3, 4, and 5, and on those seasons, the theme song only plays once at the start of the disc, following the episodes, with the ending credits appearing after each 22 minute block, and on those DVD's, when chapter selecting post hitting the play all button, each chapter is split up at the title card that starts off each 11 minute story, or each 11 minute piece, as even the 22 minute episodes are split into 2 chapters, something that was not done on the Decade in Diapers DVD, so glad to see this has been approved on.

However, when it comes to how chapters are divided up on the season 2 DVD, obviously, the opening theme starts off the chapters, but for the second 11 minute piece of each 22 minute block, those chapters split about 3 to 5 minutes into the episode, not at the title card starting off the episode. It's not a huge deal, but it might be if you want to watch for example, The Dog Broomer, which is the second 11 minute episode after Super Hero Chuckie, and via chapter selection, it starts in the middle of the episode, and not at the beginning, thus, you almost have to be sure you have time to watch a full 22 minutes, starting at the opening theme, if you want to see each episode in their entirety, and not have to do any fast rewinding post selection to get back to the beginning of the episode.

No bonuses on this season, though I can't really think of anything that would have made sense to include as a bonus on season 2, but I've noticed several people have complained that close captioning hasn't been included, and I think I know why this is on these DVD's. According to the Unofficial Rugrats Online website, created by Steve Mindacowski, if you read his episode guides, several captioning errors have occurred throughout the entire series. Surely had those been included on the seasons, and their errors not been cleaned up beforehand, there would have been several complaints from those who rely on captioning on the series, though had they taken the time to clean those up and include corrected captions, that would have been nice. Luckily though, I don't need those, so no big deal.

Also, in terms of including the theme song before each episode, it's nice they did that on this particular season, since the theme is slightly different on The Santa Experience episode. And so, another great season to get, with no issues, except for that chapter selection one, which, why this one was formatted differently, while seasons 1 and 3 weren't, is beyond me, but whatever, it's a good season, despite its flaws. I will say though, that so far, while Decade in Diapers had the Rugrats theme music play in the background of the DVD main menu screen, that hasn't been the case with these season releases, and I personally would have liked it had they chosen to do that, but no big deal that they didn't, I just think it would have been nice. No matter, despite any flaws I have found, it's flaws I can live with, so, hang on to your diapies babies, we're going in!",1419724800,,3349,4.494252873563219
