8142611,2,B000HXDM7S,"I love spaghettis for the landscapes, the campy performances, and the propaganda. This movie only really delivers on the first, despite the presence of Telly Savalas as a Confederate officer not even trying to have a Southern accent. The token minority is a Native American who is pretty bad but doesn't get to say much. Horribly dubbed. Can't really recommend it.",1300579200,,364,4.983606557377049

8142613,2,B000HXDM7S,"A film that has James Coburn and Telly Savalas starring should be entertaining, at least that's what I thought when I bought this dvd.  Unfortunately, a mediocre story line sinks this, and Savalas does not even appear until an hour into the film, and his performance is restrained at best. I'm wondering if he was doing Mario Bava's ""Lisa and the Devil"" which was around the same time, and this was just a quick job for him.  He adds nothing to the film.  Coburn is okay, but the decision to dub his voice with another actor is strange.  The cinematography is excellent, and the dvd transfer is great as well, though the first five minutes of the film is very rough, with scratches and a washed out look.  Otherwise it looks gorgeous, almost Criterion quality. The plot, borrowing liberally from the Dirty Dozen, involves Coburn ""recruiting"" men sentenced to death for various crimes.  Their mission: to destroy a Confederate base that is the key to Southern control of the South West part of the Confederacy.  The real purpose is personal, and Coburn wants Savalas dead.  Nice idea, but there is no depth to the characters; Coburn's men are a motley lot, but after the initial escape attempt, are a bunch of red shirts being led to slaughter.  For diehard spaghetti western completists only.",1197244800,3,1292,4.757847533632287
8142614,2,B000HXDM7S,"Despite the Fistful of Dynamite looking cover art, Leone this is not.  It's nothing more than a mediocre spaghetti at best and is really weakened by the dubbing of American actors who were already speaking english.  I mean really, who dubs over the legendary voice of the Late, Great Mr. James Coburn!?!?!

note:  The fort in this flick is the same fort built for El Condor with Lee Van Cleef and Jim Brown - which is a much, much better film.",1182556800,5,443,4.432098765432099
8142615,4,B000HXDM7S,"Sometimes only a spaghetti western can satisfy my cravings for some trash cinema,and I feel that this one does in spades! More-or-less a riff on the Dirty Dozen, set in the Civil War era. I won't bore you with a lengthy plot synopsis - the film slows down a bit in certain stretches (like most Spaghetti's),but the final act is something to see! Crazy rip-off of Peckinpah's ""Wild Bunch"" minus the slow-mo bits,machine guns and bodies everywhere! Ha,Ha!!",1163721600,5,454,4.833333333333333
