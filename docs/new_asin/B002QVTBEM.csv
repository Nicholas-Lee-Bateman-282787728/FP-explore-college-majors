Saw the Motown show at Mission Estate New Zealand 2 days ago and was blown away by the Temptations; Four Top; Miracles etc.
This Dvd is a must for all Motown fans.",1266105600,,220,4.261904761904762
3967689,5,B002QVTBEM,"What can I say, I loved it, especially knowing that the great voices of Mary Wells, Eddie Kendrick and David Ruffin are no longer with us.  This is must if you fans of MOtown and wnat to catch one of the lat real performance of Mary Wells.  This is a collectable DVD.",1265500800,10,267,4.115384615384615
3967690,5,B002QVTBEM,Great product for Motown Fans! It also included a rare video of the motown picnic.,1262736000,,82,4.533333333333333
3967691,4,B002QVTBEM,"If you've bought the other DVDs in the series (Supremes/Temptations/Miracles/Four Tops/Marvin Gaye),you know what to expect here....Some great footage of some of the 'lesser' Motown acts-Marvelettes,David Ruffen,Jimmy Ruffen,Edwin Starr,Brenda Holliway,plus a few Supremes,Temptations,Miracles & Four Tops clips not used on their respective DVDs. And a clip of Stevie Wonder--where's HIS DVD?????----Overall very well done,and as with the other Motown DVDs,there's a number of audio options. The only possible negative comment I can say is the qualitly of some of the clips are noy quite top-notch,but at the same time,as a hard-core collector of vintage music,I know for a fact,that the original masters for some of these clips no longer exsist,and the producers had to work with the best available sources....As for the 'bonus' footage...one of the extras is a homemovie of a Motown picnic. Intresting footage it is,but the narrator(former Motown exec,-the footage is silent)-A)Id's the footage as being from ""1970"",when it's obviously from 1973/74 B)Mis-identifies a few artists C)Refers to BERRY Gordy,Jr.-repeatly-as BARRY Gordy.",1261353600,10,1134,5.878787878787879
3967692,5,B002QVTBEM,"I HAVE NO  COMPLAINTS WITH THIS DVD.  FIRST OF ALL THANKS FOR HAVING JUST ONE PERFORMANCE BY THE SUPREMES.
THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO MOTOWN THAN THE SUPRMES. THE STANDOUTS FOR ME THE CONTOURS LOVE THE WAY  THEY ARE GROUPED
IN THERE PERFORMANCE. THE MARVELETTES NOW THEY WERE THE GIRL GROUP DANCERS. ALL OF A SUDDEN THE MARVELETTES ARE
FINALLY GETTING THEIR DUE WITH 2 PERFORMANCES PLUS PLEASE MR. POSTMAN BEING PLAYED WHILE THE CREDITS RUN. GOOD TO
SEE ARTISTS LIKE KIM WESTON, EDWIN STARR,BRENDA HOLLOWAY, JIMMY RUFFIN.  WHAT A  AMAZING PERFORMANCE  BY MARTHA
AND THE VANDELLAS SINGING NOWHERE TO RUN WHILE WE SEE A MUSTANG ASSEMBLED WITH THE  GROUP SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT
THIS  VIDEO IS SO COOL AND STILL STANDS UP. AND THE FOUR TOPS LIVE PERFORMANCE IS FUN TO WATCH. MARVIN GAYE,
 TEMPTATIONS, SMOKEY ROBINSON AND THE MIRACLES. THIS IS A FAIR REPRESENTATION OF ALL THE  MOTOWN  GROUPS WHICH
SHOW THE CONTRIBUTION EACH MADE. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY MOTOWN FAN",1260748800,9,962,4.734939759036145

The film is often very grainy and in poor condition.  The Temptations are seen doing My Girl with such poor footage that their heads are cut off at the top for much of the song.  There is more bad than good.  And forget about the ""Bonus"" features.  There are way better Motown videos available.",1259366400,84,443,4.353658536585366
3967695,2,B002QVTBEM,"This DVD was something I looked forward to, but unfortunately, fell short of my expectations. First, off.... the first video of ""Please Mr. Postman"" by the Marvelettes carries HORRIFIC film faults running down BOTH SIDES of the picture throughout the entire performance. The sad part is that Universal released this sad quality version on DVD when the same footage on YOUTUBE doesn't carry that fault (Only has minor fault on one side, intermittently)a rank amateur obviously did the transfers for this DVD, as color balance if off many times, and some clips have been artificially sharpened, and the result is VERY grainy footage. Universal was also very cheap in that they did no digital correction of any film or video tape faults. The clip of ""Tears Of A Clown"" looks great, until the color flickers in a couple of places, something that could have easliy been corrected with today's technology.",1258416000,142,899,5.0

3967707,4,B002QVTBEM,"Interesting documentary with good intentions but video quality ranges from poor to fair.
Classic standards are here of course and a few performances are real gems. I know digital restoration is time consuming and probably expensive but this is what technology is for and I can't think of a more worthwhile use for it.
Performance art is Art and should be preserved!
There are some informative extras including a 1959 newsreel type time capsule.
Actually there is no way a single disc could present the prolific history of Motown in complete performances, it would have to be a multi-disc affair with DECENT video quality!
If you love Motown don't be afraid to buy this, especially if you find it for a good price. It is tolerable but The Supremes-Reflections 1964-69 is a higher quality Motown offering.",1478995200,4,803,4.911764705882353

3967734,4,B002QVTBEM,"You'd think, as another commentator mentioned, that there might have been technically better material available to sync the classic Motown recordings to. However, this is what you get. Since the prevailing method in the '50's to 70's on these teen dance shows was for the artists to lipsync to their records, you've a mixture of primitive video or even kinescopes coupled with first rate sound. There are a few actual live performance mixed in as well. In any case, the 5.1 audio option (actually just stereo, but the cleanest option of the various included audio tracks), is a vast improvement of the notoriously weak audio presentations for which Motown is noted. I remember the early singles and l.p's being so overdone that you could actually hear the records with the amp turned off. Plus, there's an option to play the songs only. So, you can leave the t.v. off and use the soundtrack as a jukebox compendium. And, the selection and music, as we all know, is just fantastic. They really don't make them like this anymore. A great reminder of some of the most influential pop music ever.",1423440000,,1092,4.783068783068783

3967769,5,B002QVTBEM,"The birth of Motown Records, and eventually Motown Industries, organically coincided with the first maturation of television as a medium for teen entertainment. Berry Gordy created the Artist Development department, headlined by Maxine Powell. Berry cultivated the raw talent that seemed to sprout from the street corners of Detroit morphing from the doo wop groups of the 50s.
The whole of television as a medium for music started out very conservative. There were so few people of color on the air that when say a Nat King Cole half hour variety camera show, news spread through black households like a gas-soaked newspaper. So outside of Diahann Carroll on ""Julia"" or the more controversial, ""The Amos 'N Andy Show"", people of color seemed like an extinct breed that never shared nary a penlight of the spotlight.
But Ms. Powell's Pygmalion classes of upper strata breeding prepared an entire roster of artists for that transforming from proletarians to near fairytale-like debutantes and knighthood. The Valdectorian was none other than the daughter of Ernestine and Fred Ross, the inimitable Diana Ross",1390953600,,1107,5.224719101123595

3967771,4,B002QVTBEM,"This is a great collection of Motown's finest from their golden hit making years. The adults enjoyed the video for the trip down memory lane that it induced, the younger generation enjoyed it because the DVD puts a face on the classic songs they hear on on the radio and in the car. Also it's fun to convince our little cherubs that our plasma television isn't broken, and explain to them that there were very little color programming back then.",1387756800,4,445,4.575
3967772,1,B002QVTBEM,"Insulting, both to the artists that appear on the DVD, and to anyone who buys it. For the simple reason that whoever made this piece of s##t dvd didn't respect the singers enough to leave in the original soundtrack, but felt they needed to impose a high-def recording of the original hit onto old, faded films of the artists, like they do on PBS tv shows now. I mean, can't they figure-out that anybody who is interested enough in the history of this music that they are willing to put up with old films is also willing to put up with bad sound, as long as it is the original live recording? If they had any respect for our intellegence they would, but they dont.
 The thing that bothers me also is that in reading these reviews before I bought thie dvd, I read so many that complained about the poor picture. I didn't see ANY that complained about the fact that the dvd had stripped OUT the original soundtrack and inserted an awkward sounding modern recording over the old film, when combined givies the entire package a fake look and sound. I would like to flush the thing down the toilet, I swear I would, but it would be an insult to the other stuff I flush down it",1384732800,16,1170,4.318181818181818

I love love love the caucasions girls dancing in the background. They did a wonderful job with their go go boots. This is wonderful if you want to look back on the songs and the steps that the groups danced to. Fabulous! I will watch it again and again.
Buy it now! You will not be disappointed.

3967797,1,B002QVTBEM,"This item was made in a back alley it is so badly done and obviously by some inexperienced individual going through personally taped concerts from broken down VHS tapes that are possibly scratched and lacking any original quality or resolution it might have at one time had.

There are lines running through some of the musical sets, offset and horrible view.  Worst, absolutely the worst made DVD I have yet seen.  I love Motown and own many DVDs of this excellent music era.  I was ripped off knowing I paid certainly more than the 25 cents for its value.

I want my money back, this is garbage.

3967801,4,B002QVTBEM,"This was a great concept. Although there were times in certain areas of the video, the quality was gritty and streaky. Overall, this is an excellent dvd showing the classic motown performers in their prime. The video also shows, these performers had a strong support system in Berry Gordy. With that factor, and their strong work ethic to their profession, they were successful. Hard work and dedication paid off for many of these performers. I would recommend this treasure to anyone who would like see how the motown sound was created.",1292976000,5,537,4.912087912087912
