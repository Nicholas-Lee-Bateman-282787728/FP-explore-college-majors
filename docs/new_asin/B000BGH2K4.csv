8086412,3,B000BGH2K4,"Hokey is the word, but still enjoyable.  I can't resist a Foreign Legion film, and this one doesn't disappoint.  Yvonne De Carlo is suitably vampy and heroic.  Good old fashioned fun.",1461542400,,183,4.838709677419355

8086415,4,B000BGH2K4,"After watching each and every episode of Perry Mason, all NINE seasons, we have completely fallen in love with old Ray(mond) Burr. So... now we're watching his other movies too. This one was pretty cool :)",1402185600,2,205,4.722222222222222
8086416,5,B000BGH2K4,The title of this review says it all.  Quality of the hardware ... Great.  Quality of the story ... depends on personal taste.  Why doesn't Universal release two box sets featureing the most beaufiful female who ever worked for their studio.  One could be the black and white features and the other could showcase the real Queen Of Techincolor.  I would buy two copies of each one just in case I wore one out.,1354233600,3,409,4.472972972972973

8086418,1,B000BGH2K4,"The film is in black & white.

A white-guy plays the Arab-sheik with tanning-makeup, breaking all realism. The producers did not care to hire an Arab to play the part.

The low-budget-sets, lack of props, and lack of extra-people make you always aware you are on low-budget film-set, in a low-budget-film, and are not in Algeria; further breaking all realism.

There is no story of interest, no humor, no cleverness, no suspense, no one you care about, no romance, no believable action, and only minimal suggestion of the foreign-legion. Anyone could have written this script, and done better.

I recommend instead: ""Beau Geste"", ""Gunga Din"", or ""Wee Willie Winkie"".",1283817600,,666,5.08256880733945
8086419,4,B000BGH2K4,"The fort in FORT ALGIERS is like a fort in any American western, however, this time it has been transplanted to Algeria, with the French Foreign Legion as the cavalry saving the day. Cliches like bullets fly left and right, but it is still fun to see oily smooth villain Raymond Burr (vintage 1953) and lovely singer/spy Yvonne De Carlo in action. An entertaining 76 minutes, directed by one of the most capable, but often overlooked Hollywood contract directors of B westerns, Lesley Selander. Selander's crowning achievements, among numerous lower budget films, in my opinion, are the two B+ Rod Cameron westerns: PANHANDLE (1948) and STAMPEDE (1949).
I will bestow 3 stars upon FORT ALGIERS for entertainment value, but must absolutely insist on adding another star for the pristine pictorial quality of the DVD. Geneon has released a flawless black and white print, clean and sharp. Even Criterion could not have done better. The disc has no extras, but for the condition and low price, FORT ALGIERS is a B movie treasure.",1143590400,27,1026,4.97093023255814
