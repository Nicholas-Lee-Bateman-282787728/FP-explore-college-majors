7993078,2,B00009V7PO,"If you like the ""Cantinflas"" movies and you're over 45 -and have sentimental connections with Mexico- you might like this movie. But your children probably will not! This movie is simply too old-fashioned in every aspect.

I bought it for my 3 y.o son and, like me, he didn't care for the movie at all.",1193011200,,421,4.410256410256411
