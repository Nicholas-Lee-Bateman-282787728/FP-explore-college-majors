208658,5,6300150151,"A thirteen-century ballad provides the conceptual source for the Virgin Spring written by novelist and screenplay writer Ulla Isaksson.  The ballad is titled, Tre's Daughter at Vnge, and there are evidently several versions of this ballad.  Isaksson used the ballad to retell the legend of a virgin's harrowing doom amidst the dark ages.  As the legend goes, a virgin met a brutal demise and the location of her death became the origin of a spring with healing powers.  Those interested in the legend should know that there is a spring connected with the legend located in central Sweden where people gather to celebrate midsummer and enjoy the healing powers of the spring.  Whether the spring actually has healing powers is for each reader to decide, but the legend serves as terrific base for a brilliant story.

The Swedish director Ingmar Bergman found the idea appealing and gave it his own cinematic treatment, which went on and won his first Oscar.  What is interesting is that Bergman usually writes his own material, but with the Virgin Spring, he made one of a few exceptions and directed a film based on someone else's written work.  For a film such as the Virgin Spring, Bergman is the best possible choice as a director, as he has a keen understanding for Christianity and human psychology.  Bergman's awareness captures the audience much like Munch's paintings where the anxiety and emotional pain emerge in the moment when the work connects with the audience.  It is all in done through his meticulous direction that does not leave anything aside, as his cinematic artistry evolves into something grander than illustrated on the silver screen.  Thus, Bergman has the perfect mind and creativity to seize the psychological oppression of the dark ages where guilt and fear are the driving forces behind humanity and divinity.

Over a fireplace stands Ingeri (Gunnel Lindblom) in the opening of the film with fierce wildness in her eyes, as she breathes life back into the fire.  Symbolically, it offers a notion to pagans that frequented the countryside when Christianity had just begun to spread in the northern nations of today's Europe.  Ingeri is up early before anyone else, taking care of the important chores on a farm somewhere in the dark woods of Sweden in a time when people still believed in the trolls, witches, and other sinister creatures.  Her back is aching from an illegitimate child that she bears within, as she carefully checks the room to see if she is alone.  When she is certain of her solitude, she looks through the ceiling hole towards the sky and pleads to the highest god in Norse mythology, Odin, for aid.  At the time, if caught it could possibly mean a certain death for Ingri, if reported to authorities.  The opening presents a time of fear and spiritual oppression, as Ingeri performs this early morning ritual in great secrecy.

Contrastingly, an introduction to Christianity of the time emerges through Tre (Max von Sydow) and his wife Mreta (Birgitta Valberg) praying before a crucifix.  They pray to God for protection from temptations, shame, and dangers.  It is evident that both Tre and Mreta are devoted Christians, and live strictly by the gospels of the lord.  The scene initiates a strong presence of Christian values that continues throughout the film, including the seven deadly sins and the seven virtues.  Mreta even demonstrates her apprehension to what might happen, if they are to do wrong.  The whole film seems drenched in heavy guilt burden by fear of misdoing, or of past transgressions.  The guilt and fear becomes two overwhelming forces that steer the film in its intended direction, as it displays how each sin emerges from of a previous sin.

The film's opening leads the audience to learn that Mreta spoils her daughter Karin (Birgitta Pettersson), as the fear of loosing her only daughter has dug its claws deep within her.  It leads Mreta to have a relaxed attitude towards Karin, which seems to trouble Tre, because Karin has become both vain and lazy.  In addition, the mother's constant sheltering of the daughter has brought about an extremely nave character within Karin, as she is completely unaware of the dangers in the world.  Meanwhile, Ingri has a deep-rooted envy for Karin, probably due to her tedious and difficult chores from which Karin is completely protected.

As a virgin, Karin is the only one suitable to deliver Virgin Mary candles to the only church that lays some distance away.  Unaware of Ingeri's hatred, Karin requests that she come along.  However, before they set off Ingri curses the ration intended for Karin with a toad in the hope of her demise, or other evil misfortune.  Whether the curse works or not depends on the fate of the believer.  On the trip they come across a number of interesting characters before Karin stumbles upon her looming fate.  They all play stimulating roles, which adds additional drama while it helps convoluting the story in an interesting way. However, it is not until Karin meets three brothers that she enters the phase that will seal her fate.  The tension of wickedness lingers like the big bad wolf circling the little red riding hood, but here there is more than one perpetrator.

An interesting thought in regards to innocence emerges during the viewing, as Karin navely expects nothing but goodness from all she meets.  It is obvious she is unaware of the lurking dangers of the world, and as previously mentioned much is due to her mother's overprotective tendencies.  This innocence is incapable of harming anyone, as it clearly embraces the virtues of Christianity with zealous dedication.  The notion of her virtuous ideals appears clearly, when she welcomes the three brothers to break bread with her before they make her realize the existing evils.  In the light of the crime, the concept of virginity provides a symbolic reference to goodness.

Amidst the thick Christian theme burden by both anguishing guilt and psychological fear of what if captures the true spirit of the medieval times.  Bergman even suggests that no one is without sin, even the virgin Karin shows signs of sloth while all others present one or more of the seven deadly sins.  Ingri, who witnesses the dreadful event in the wood opening, plays a significant part in regards to the sin.  Both Mreta and Tre also display error that takes the shape of one of the seven sins.  The gruesome, yet excellent Se7en (1995), where a serial killer carries out his heinous crimes after the seven deadly sins - gluttony, lust, greed, envy, sloth, pride, and eventually wrath vaguely resembles the path of the Virgin Spring.  In the end, the Virgin Spring provides a strongly spiritual film that provides an authentic ambiguous atmosphere that displays the anxiousness and guilty conscience of the time.  It also offers much contemplation in regards to the moral values and the importance of ethics among people, which ultimately turns into a truly spectacular cinematic experience.",1138752000,8,6998,4.951198630136986
208659,5,6300150151,"`The Virgin Spring' directed by the great Swedish film auteur, Ingmar Bergman in 1959 is, I believe, one of his earliest and, to contemporary eyes, possibly his crudest movies. It may seem crude since its great power is much less invested in plot as it is in characterization and in mythic overtones, much like Bergman's other early films such as `The Magician', `Wild Strawberries', and `The Seventh Seal'. And yet, this film may be even more powerful than some of these others, as it makes no use at all of supernatural or fantasy overtones.

This movie was the source of the story for `The Last House on the Left', famed horror writer / director Wes Craven's very first movie. Be very clear that Bergman's film is NOT a horror movie. It is not even a suspense movie or thriller and it certainly has less erotic or bloody scenes as in Craven's essay on the subject. I enjoyed the fact that Craven had no apologies for cribbing from such a famous source, as he correctly indicates that Bergman himself borrowed this story from an old Swedish legend.

In fact, it even takes place in 14th century Sweden, which is clear since it is obvious it must be set before the Protestant Reformation, which Sweden embraced as fully as any European country, since all the characters in the film are clearly Catholic. And, religion plays a very important part in the story.

And, while the story is powerful, in some ways even harking back to the revenge plots of the Greek tragedies, much of the power of the film comes from the acting and the skill with which the actors' expressions are captured by the very famous cinematographer, Sven Nykvist, who did most of Bergman's early films, later to move on to film a few films for Woody Allen.

The faces of the actors, especially those who lived in the `manor house' owned by Max Von Sydow's character whose faces are not obscured by dark facial hair, seem to be chiseled from marble. The characters' expressions seem to tell as much of the story as their dialogue.

One of the most accurate statements among the blurbs on the cover is the phrase that describes the film as `Unflinchingly simple and direct.' This is probably a very good example of how great feeling can be evoked from simple situations. This movie is probably as totally different as you can imagine where a murder is involved and Alfred Hitchcock directed the movie. There is very little suspense, although there is an unfolding of audience expectations as they watch the characters discover what the audience already knows.

This is not as interesting a movie to my tastes as my favorite early Bergman film, `The Magician', but it is definitely more interesting than many of Bergman's later movies set in contemporary times.

This is a `must see' for those with any interest in film in general or Bergman (or Wes Craven for that matter) in particular.",1135728000,4,2857,4.702

The story revolves around a man's quest to avenge the rape and murder of his daughter.  Although the movie was very predictable, I found it to be very effective in stirring emotions and getting me to think.

In some ways, the movie reminded me of ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" but ironically, the main character seeking vengenge in this film didn't show as much emotion.

The scene in the film with the goatherders and the girl was very disturbing, but what I found equally disturbing was the violent scene in the end.  What was depicted in both of those scenes is seldom (if ever) depicted in modern films.  It's not for the shear brutallity of it, but who the brutallity was aimed at.  It was clear from what happened that the father did not have to do what he did to all three.

208696,5,6300150151,"I just finished watching this MAGNIFICENT, wrenching, PROFOUNDLY humane film.

May I interrupt with a few tawdry comments?
I NEVER CRY (still a mystery) and when those ""hankie"" movies are shown on Turner Classics I find it a bit ""repulsive"" that my partner cries with those shallow melodramas. Even with Jeannette MacDonald! Did I choose....well.....

TONIGHT I DID.

Getting up to get something from the kitchen? It crossed my mind, but it was simply impossible to detach myself from this work of art.

I had seen the movie 20 years ago, and when I rented it again this time I KNEW I would be seeing the work of a master. But I barely remembered the plot------and anyway, I don't watch movies for plot, generally.

I don't know what to say------words fail me. The movie is only 90 minutes, but it is so RIVETING that it might as well be 15.

It is a very ""simple"" tale of medieval people who are all basically good human beings, pious and deeply devoted to their faith. What else did you have in such a period of time? Indeed, we in our comfort (those of who are, even when you're down and out in the ""modern world"") will be touched deeply by the way Bergman presents the period in all its poverty, its dirt and wanting, its habits that show humans as we were-------almost animals in the way they eat, the shelter they occupy.
Max von Sydow is LUMINOUS in his role, and they all perform without an inch of doubt for us to consider. The names escape me, but the wife, the two young girls, the servants, the criminals are all magnificent. How do you cast such an ensemble?

Basically I don't bother with plot in my reviews because a thousand others have given you that. I simply offer you snippets of the film, but primarily my impression.
Bergman is, broadly speaking, considered the ""ultimate downer""------mention Bergman and even art-film lovers tremble, preparing themselves for what's ahead-------deeply depressive stuff. And there is perhaps quite some truth to that. Think of ""Cries and Whispers"", a movie I don't want to see with any regularity-----though also a profound meditation on our psyche.

In my opinion, that is not the case with this film. There is a tenderness, a silence, a group of people who carry on with life grimly, but also quietly accepting.
From afar the fim appears a very simple one. But Bergman offers us the human ""heart"", our deepest emotions in quiet, stealthy ways that few auters do.

The very BEAUTIFUL pregnant girl, who remains mostly an enigma, and who they basically treat at arms length, is a magnificently beautiful woman. What became of her as an actress?
And here I am wondering why Bergman did not cast her as the main role. Perhaps because she is too ""sexual"", too vixen-like for us to see her as a truly innocent girl.
Other things are perplexing. Why does the family permit a girl to stay overnight in the town, as we come to know she has done many times? Well, one can only guess that crime is virtually unheard of in such a corner of the world. Sweden, I believe.
It is fascinating that the pregnant girl harbors a certain hatred for the ""maiden"", as she sees the love and devotion that the latter one is given.
And then the wife confesses to the husband that she came to ""hate"" him as he devoted his love on their only child.

NOTHING changes in life, right? it is a lesson you are left with------the human emotions we harbored for millenia are still with us today. All our longings and hatreds and love and pride---------we are virtually unchanged.

It is a little off-putting that the movie closes with a magnificent miracle. But only the most cynical will hold that against Bergman.....in fact, he is ""re-creating"" an old poem that was very famous at the time. I have no patience for ""miracles"" (except that we are in fact SURROUNDED by them from birth to death------isn't that a conundrum...) but Bergman brings it to a close in such a beautiful way that there is no need to question this at all. No intellectualizing at this point. He has us, virtually, in the palm of his hand.

Very few movies are as MAGICAL, as entrancing, as powerful, as humane, as quietly understanding of our sorrows and wretchedness, our LONGING for TRANSCENDENCE as this film.

Now, I will say to you that the ""BEASTS"", the repugnant men that carry the horrible rape and killing (come to think of it------happening EVERY DAY by the thousands in this world TODAY!!)are also INNOCENTS. How many of you agree with such a statement?
The fact is that they are almost animals, living mostly by instinct, given to evil by all the hatred that has been thrown at them. Their act is one of sudden lust, for men who perhaps have never seen such beauty in their lives. And beauty can intoxicate us, DERAIL us, make us do things we never would otherwise. And, sadly, for naught. Physical beauty is one of the most overrated of qualities in our human condition.

It takes place in Medieval Sweden a few centuries after it's adoption of Christianity and focuses on a grieving father's (Max Von Sydow) revenge of the rape and murder of his cherished only child, a daughter named Karin (Birgitta Pettersson). The film is shot in black and white and contains some truly beautiful, pastoral scenery, which forms an interesting contrast with the dark tone of the film. Although it takes place during an era when Christianity was firmly entrenched in Swedish society, at the beginning of the film the maid-servant Ingeri (Gunnel Lindblom) tries to invoke the pagan god Odin's wrath on Karin, whom she is jealous of due to her favored status in the home and her innocence. It demonstrates that old habits and customs die hard, and illustrates Bergman, who was an avowed atheist, and his view that all religion, not just Christianity, was negative and harmful. The themes in this film include revenge, faith, morality, and violence and I feel it was a much better film than the 1972 Wes Craven exploitation film The Last House on the Left and it's awful remake, both of which were inspired by this film. The acting in this film is great all around and while the rape scene is definitely unpleasant, it was a relief not seeing anything too graphic or disturbing, which cannot be said for the rape scenes in pretty much any film made since the 70's such as I spit on your grave and it's remake, Irreversible, and Life it Hot in Cracktown.

ring truer and more emotional.

a couple of key moments felt a bit contrived, but this is a very tense,
intense, disturbing and emotional look at one family from another time

In order to put this film in proper context, you have to remember that it is set in 14th century Sweden.  This isn't modern times or even last century, so behaviors differ.  A religious landowner (Max von Sydow) sends his 15 year old virgin daughter (Birgitta Pettersson) to the local town taking candles to their church. She is accompanied by a pregnant young woman (Gunnel Lindblom) whom Tore (von Sydow) had taken in.  Ingeri (Lindblom) disliked Karin (Pettersson) however because the family pampered her so much.  In route to the church they become separated.  Continuing on, Karin comes across 3 brothers herding their goats.  The youngest is only about 12 but the older brothers are adults.

The nave Karin accepts an invitation to picnic but the older boys have more in mind.  In a difficult scene Karin is raped, killed and stripped of her elaborate clothing.  Having caught up to Karin, Ingeri watches in hiding without intervening.  The story moves back to the Tore farm where they await Karin's return, not knowing her fate.  The three brothers show up looking for shelter.  Tore agrees and takes them in and feeds them.  Tore's wife, Mareta (Birgitta Valberg) is tucking in the young boy, when one of the brothers offers to sell her the dress worn by the daughter, not knowing the relationship.  To me, this is an inconsistency in the storyline.  Earlier, Karin had told the brothers where she lived, at least directionally.  Were these guys too stupid to think that the farm they stumbled upon might be her parents?

Once the very formidable Tore learns of the incident with the dress, he enters the area where the brother's are sleeping and discovers more of Karin's clothing, some with blood on them.  He manages to slit the throat of one, puts another in a fire pit and tosses the boy across the room into a brick wall.  Earlier, Mareta had returned and told Tore what she had seen, even implicating the boy who was not actually involved in the rape or killing of the girl.  Why would she do this?  When Tore and their workers return to the woods to recover Karin's body, he is not only overcome with grief but by his sin of killing the brothers.  He asks God for forgiveness, promising to build a church with his own hands on the spot where Karin died.  As they pick her body, water begins to flow where her head had lain.  Thus the virgin spring.

Director Ingmar Bergman directs this Oscar winner for best foreign film.  The visuals are well done in this Criterion adaptation.  The sound is Dolby Digital mono and is fine if unremarkable.  Perhaps what is most surprising about this very good movie is that is a blueprint for Wes Craven's ""Last House on the Left.""",1331078400,3,2699,4.670912951167728

208716,5,6300150151,"The plot of VIRGIN SPRING is simple: In the 14th century hinterlands of Sweden, a propserous man & wife see their only (living) child, a beautiful girl, off on the girl's short pilgrimage to deliver white candles for the Virgin Mary at the local church. En route she is waylaid by 3 louts & they rape & murder her. It is their misfortune to seek nightly lodging at the parents' farm. One of them tries to sell the daughter's stolen garments. BIG mistake.

There are some elements that sugguest to me that the plot is based on real events. It really doesn't matter, and I don't think that giving the plot away detracts from the reader's potential viewing experiemce because, it is not so much the plot, but how the plot unveils, that is at the heart of VIRGIN SPRING.

There's Max Von Sydow's strong, somewhat repressive Nordic presence. It's no wonder Bergman cast him again & again in his many notable productions. Max seems to have stepped out of a book of fables. He & his wife are totally infatuated by their daughter, the only surviving child. They both try, but fail, to cover-up their love & tendency to spoil the girl.

There is the touching scene when the mother, totally but sweetly ruled by her daughter, helps to put on her finest garments for the horseback ride to the Church with her gift of candles. She is so gentle & loving. Later we learn that she is jealous of her husband's relation with the daughter. We also learn that she is prone to inflict pain on herself as penance.

There is the strange & sullen pregnant servant girl (one reviewer called her a foster daughter) full of resentment and who believes in the old gods. She prays to Odin to intervene on her behalf. She looks very much like a angry, beautiful witch.

The servant accompanies the daughter, but gets sidetracked by an ugly, old pagan wizard who literally lives in the middle of a fast flowing spring. He displays his little treasures to her, like a severed finger with the power to cause a person's blood to cease to flow. When he leeringly tries to put the move on the girl, she gets repulsed and runs away.

She witnesses the daughter's graphic & hideous rape & killing, but is unable--or perhaps unwilling--to prevent it. It is a gut-wrenching scene that is thankfully comparatively brief.

At the end of the movie, after the transgressors have met with hinterland justice, there is the tragic scene where all the members of the family have gone on foot to find the daughter's body. Again, it is a touching scene of simple authenticity with the 6 or 7 people of all ages stumbling swiftly & despondently across forest & streams to find the outraged girl.

As her mother is gently cleaning the dirt off the girl's face, off to the side Von Sydow has collapsed on his knees, railing at God for having not prevented his daughter's grotesque fate. There is often this same sort of God-questioning monologue in Bergman's film. They are usually a sort of Existentialist commentary on the film's themes & events. It is generally an impotent cry to a God so far removed from human reality as to be unable or unwilling to hear the lament. It's a little different in VIRGIN SPRING. After the father accuses a God who may or not be there, Von Sydow immediately rises up & vows to overcome his doubts by building a church on the spot. He proclaims that he'll build it himself, brick by brick.

Some people saw this is as cop-out. I prefer to think it reflects a time when belief in God was still required in order to continue the moral & social evolution of humanity. In contemporary times we have become too cynical & too brutalized ourselves to invoke or blame a god who may or may not exist.

PS. After finishing this review I read some of the others. The first 2 in the series (the oldest) are outstanding & masterpieces in their own right. In comparison mine is more subjective & a little sketchy. So I'm encouraging people who read this in my Profile to link back to the product page & read these wonderful reviews.

208718,5,6300150151,"Never been a great fan of Bergman's films. Have looked at about a dozen of them over the years and this is about the only one that grabbed me.
Usually this guy's touchy-feely B.S.  either puts me to sleep or else I get a strong urge to throw things at the screen.

So, yeah, see this one. But I'd say Last House On The Left (directed by Wes Craven) is just as strong and gut-churning, if not stronger. The only thing that is hard to take is the absolutely moronic and UNFUNNY keystone cops segment that takes place between all the wrenching mayhem.

Hey, Wes, people who love and respect horror DO NOT WANT TO SEE

Sutle, dark humor (as in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is acceptable...but nothing beyond that--unless you're doing UBER CRAP

208721,5,6300150151,"Some films abruptly attack your senses, leaving their mark on you almost immediately.  Other films, like `Jungfrukallan', make it a point to creep up on you slowly, never really unveiling its true motive until the final frames.  Films like this are haunting to say the least, and this is truly a film that will never leave you.

Set in medieval Sweden, `Jungfrukallan' tells us the story of Tore, a peasant farmer who is trying to raise his only daughter Karin and his adopted daughter Ingeri to live the Christian way.  Karin is beautiful yet nave and slightly vain, while Ingeri, who has managed to get herself pregnant, is resentful of Karin's beauty and charm.  She herself is not nave to the way of the world as her sister is, and this causes her to become hardened towards her.

The panicle scene in the film comes when Karin and Ingeri are on their way to a distant church.  As they travel through the woods Karin is savagely attacked by three herdsmen.  She is violated and then murdered.  The three men then turn and venture to find shelter, unknowingly calling upon Tore for room and board, which he provides.  Tore and his wife Mareta are desperately waiting for their daughter to return, but since the journey was a long way off they conclude that she must have spent the night in the village.  But light is shed and they realize that these men sleeping in their barn may very well have had something to do with their daughter's disappearance.

`Jungfrukallan' is a wonderful example of a film that broaches a wide variety of subjects and emotions without running over two hours in length.  In fact, the film isn't even an hour and a half, yet it devastatingly captures the purity in human emotion and reaction.

Ingmar Bergman is one of those filmmakers that is lauded as the best of the best, and while I am new to his fan club and have only seen a few of his films I must say that he approaches each film with such honesty.  What I love so much about his work, especially in `Jungfrukallan', is that he allows the audience to take what they must from the film, and he offers so much that we are bound to find something we need.  Within the final frames alone `Jungfrukallan' broaches the need for god, for forgiveness, for understanding; he also broaches the idealism of purity, which is embellished by the corruption and eventual demise of a young boy.  Bergman, without bias, looks deeply into the heart of love and vengeance, and the power of suggestion.  Guilt is seen as each surviving character blames themselves for the tragedy, and layers of humility are seen as they attempt to put back all the pieces.

This is not a film for everyone.  Not only is it tragic and brutal in scenes, but Bergman is also an acquired taste so-to-speak.  I know a lot of people who find his style of filmmaking boring and tedious, but if you appreciate the artform that is film then you will see the genius behind each and every frame.",1227139200,2,2938,4.558095238095238
208722,3,6300150151,"Ingmar Bergman's 1960 film The Virgin Spring (Jungfrukllan) is, despite its winning the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1961, one of his lesser outings. Part of this is, no doubt, due to the fact that the bulk of the film was not written by Bergman, but by novelist Ulla Isaksson, who based her thin script upon a medieval ballad called Tre's Daughter At Vnge. The title of the film is a double entendre which refers to the chaste lead character's outing during the springtime, and a rivulet of water that emerges from where her corpse is eventually found by her family after she is raped and murdered. Compared to the films which preceded it, it lacks the emotional heft of The Seventh Seal or Wild Strawberries, and compared to the films that followed it, it lacks the filmic daring of Persona or A Passion. It is an odd film in the Bergman canon, and ranks with Cries And Whispers and The Serpent's Egg as one of the few filmic mediocrities the director ever crafted. Its characters are wooden, almost unintendedly comic, their motivations and reactions are wholly stilted and artificial, and the symbolism is often heavyhanded. Fortunately, it's only an hour and a half in length. It's little wonder that only a dozen or so years later horror filmmaker Wes Craven (and Sean Cunningham) would launch his forgettable career with a film heavily influenced by, if not flat out based upon, it, called Last House On The Left....  Yet, the reason why this film fails to live up to the high standards of most Bergman films- although, by contrast, it's still worlds better than 99.9% of the Hollywood crap churned out today, all boils down to that most important, yet overlooked, reason why all films fail or succeed, and that's because, despite being a visual medium, a film must be well written, with well developed characters and a scenario that can emotionally affect a viewer, be that in the archetypal or realistic vein, to succeed artistically. This film never gets off the stylistic fence and decides whether it is a realistic film nor a symbolic allegory. Thus it fails on both scores, and the bulk of the blame for that can be laid upon the pro-Christian leaning script of the novelist Ulla Isaksson, who wrote an earlier Bergman film, So Close To Life, a few years before. While there is no comparing Wes Craven's 1972 filmic spin on this theme, Last House On The Left, in any cinematic nor artistic terms to The Virgin Spring, in one odd way, Craven's later film does seem more relevant, for it never attempts to find reasons for, nor make sense of, its anomic violence, thus it cannot fail, on that level. Bergman's film asks the big questions, and when its own silence bellows forth no answers, its hollowness only too easily engulfs its own inquisitions, which displays flaws the lesser film could only dream to be vilified for.",1221955200,3,2854,4.730923694779117
208723,5,6300150151,"After seeing THE SEVENTH SEAL, I wanted to explore other works by Bergman. I checked this out on NetFlix - thank God for NetFlix! - and I have to say that it is now one of my favorite films. This is in no way a pleasant film experience, but it is one that needs to be seen. It is the story of a young, virginal teenager who comes from a very religious family in Sweden. As she is riding on horseback to carry out a task for her father, she is raped and murdered by a pair of disgusting goatherds in the forest. However, as fate would have it, the goatherds unknowingly arrive at the young girl's home for shelter. Let's just say that by the end of the film, they'll wish they hadn't. This film asks many questions about God's mercy and grace. Why does God allow horrible things to happen to good people? Where is God in those moments? Many films would go on to explore this territory. I believe that this is one of the first - or atleast, one of the first to explore this topic with such powerful results.

See this film once, and you'll never forget it. There are long scenes without dialogue that build a mood and allow you to simply observe the world that Bergman has created. Never before have I seen a film that benefited more from it's quiet moments.

For all of it's ugliness, this really is a beautiful film. I highly recommend it. I can truthfully say that it had an impact on me. What more could I have asked for than that? In a world where we are smothered by the likes of BANGKOK DANGEROUS and the over-hyped DARK KNIGHT, it's especially important to cherish films like THE VIRGIN SPRING.",1221264000,4,1600,4.2947019867549665
208724,5,6300150151,"Ingmar Bergman's film ""The Virgin Spring"" is based on the Swedish folk ballad.  It is set at the time when pagan worship was intermixed with newly arrived Christianity.  The film explores the meaning of good and evil and how it affects us in every day life. According to the story, it is customary that a young virgin maiden brings candles and offerings to the Church on a high holiday.  Karen, an only daughter of a wealthy trader and his wife is to deliver them to the church herself.  Her escort is a female servant, pregnant and unmarried who spends her time cooking, baking and taking care of household chores. Karen is young, pure, innocent, blond; her servant is dark haired, thin and worn out from the hard work and pregnancy and for all that resentful.  While Karen is adored, pampered and spoiled by her parents and servants, her servant girl is tormented and criticised about everything about her.  Both of them are day and night.  In the process of delivering candles to the church, naive Karen runs into three shepards and offers them some food.  Before long, two elder ones attack her, rape her and murder her.  She is stripped off her clothes and left in a ditch as her servant girl is watching it all in horror.  Circumstances bring shepards to Karen's parents house where they are offered food and shelter. In gratitude, shepards offer Karen's mother Karen's clothes for sale, not realizing that it is murdered girls' mother they were selling clothes to.  As pregnant girl servant makes it to the village and explains to Karen's father what has happened and she confirms that shepards are rapists and murderers, Karen's father decides to ravenge his only child's death.  All three shepards are murdered and household sets out to finding Karen's body. It is at the place where Karen's body is found that some of the most powerful scenes from the film transpire.  Her father is asking God how God could allow that a young, innocent girl has such terrible fate.  In the nature where everything is so calm and beautiful how could God take away precious life of an innocent girl?  It is after Karen's body is removed, that everyone realizes that she was laid under a spring of pure water of life. So the revenge was futile.  Karen is dead, her tormentors are dead, life will never be the same for everyone involved, but must start new, fresh and pure with everlasting pain that will be reminder to what happened to a young maiden and everyone who loved and resented her.",1217808000,,2482,4.684331797235023
208725,5,6300150151,"Karin (Birgitta Pettersson), the spoiled but lovable only surviving child of wealthy householder Tore (Max von Sydow) and his wife Mareta (Birgitta Valberg) is raped and murdered as a dark and gypsy-like free spirited servant, Ingeri (Gunnel Lindblom) looks on.  Later, the rapists unwittingly ask for shelter from the night at Tore's house.  Their identity is discovered, Tore slays each of them (even a young boy who accompanies them but who didn't participate in the crime), Karin's body is discovered, and a healing spring miraculously gushes from the spot where she was violated and slain.  The film closes with everyone kneeling in prayer.

Your typical ""Song of Bernadette"" sort of flick?  Nope.  It's Bergman, and that means that the apparent piety of the film needs to be read through a glass darkly.  The film, both visually and thematically, is really a study in contrast between darkness and light:  camera shots accentuate the interplay between the two, and so do the moral dynamics of the characters and the action.  Karin is a combination of spoiled and innocent child; Ingeri, tempest and depth; Tore, piety and fury; Mareta, self-hatred and maternal love.  Nothing in the world is straightforward, unambiguous, simple.  Even the ""religious"" ending of the film is immediately prefaced by an agonized Tore, on his knees but nonetheless defiant and angry (again, the contrast), shouting out to God:  ""You allowed it to happen--the death of an innocent child and my vengeance!  You allowed it to happen!  I don't understand you!""  The Job-like rebel--and yet in the very next frame, Tore says:  ""Yet still I ask your forgiveness.  I don't know any other way to live.""  This magnificent scene reminds one of the story from Auschiwtz, in which interned rabbis, after an all-night session, determined that God was guilty of crimes against humanity, but then adjourned for morning prayer.

Bergmam originally intended ""Virgin Spring,"" filmed immmediately after ""Seventh Seal,"" to be the first in his God trilogy.  Eventually, however, it was excluded from the trilogy.  Yet the theme of all five films, from ""Seventh Seal"" to ""The Silence,"" are of one piece:  how to live in a world where God is either absent or malevolent.  It's a good question.

The performances in this film, by the way, are magnificent.  Pettersson is the perfect spoiled, innocent girl, and Lindblom's darkness and anger are frightening.  Von Sydow is frightening in a different way as the avenging father.  But perhaps the finest performance is given by Valberg, whose Mareta is a loveless, desperate woman who clings to her only surviving child by spoiling her, and who apparently tries to make deals with providence by physically punishing herself.",1217030400,,2733,5.124434389140271

This adaptation of a ballad of the XIVth century tells the story of a young virgin who's raped in the forest by three vagrants while riding to the church. I don't know what to admire most in this film: Ulla Isaksson's screenplay that is so keen with its references to fairy tales (the Little Red Riding Hood, for instance) or the description of the antagonism Paganism/Christianism, Sven Nykvist's photography which literally re-creates before our eyes paintings of the Middle Ages or at last the formidable artistic fusion that existed between Ingmar Bergman and his actors. No place for improvisation in Bergman's cinema!

The swiftness of the story, the space allowed for interpretation, the simplicity of intention; the ominous nature of dream, feeling, omen, impulse-all evenly and gently presented, make for a spectacular film.
The final section, focusing on the (Max von Sydow) father of a murdered maiden, and his will to revenge and blossoming faith is harrowing, with a deafening silence and one of Film's greatest silent screams.
No hyperbole here: The Virgin Spring is a masterpiece of faith, silence, impulse, eternal love and ultimate hope. Highly recommended.",1206662400,3,794,5.36
208738,5,6300150151,"A virgin spring would be an early spring when the days break bright and clear but the nights are still forbiddingly cold.  As one of the characters says, The day began with such promise only to end tragically--or words to that effect.  A virgin spring is also that time in a young maiden's life when she is still innocent and has no sense of the hardships to come or the beasts that dwell in the deep dark woods.  And a virgin spring may be a miraculous sign from God of clear spring water flowing spontaneously from an hitherto unknown fountain, a place on which to build a church to honor the God that one has offended.

All of these springs are in this riveting masterwork by one of cinema's greatest directors, the incomparable Ingmar Bergman.  Light and darkness suffuse the 14th century landscape of a Sweden only partially given over to Christianity.  Odin still rules the forests and the glades, the mountain tops and the cold, deep rivers.  He is the god of darkness in this film, almost something akin to the devil, worshiped by the bridge keeper shaman with his herbs and by the dark-haired, dark-eyed young servant Ingeri (played with something close to demonic vivaciousness by Gunnel Lindblom).  Lightness comes in the form of her privileged stepsister, Karin (Birgitta Pettersson) who is blonde and gets to wear fine clothes and is much loved by her father, Tore (Max von Sydow), and her doting mother, Mareta (Birgitta Valberg).

And so one bright spring day the two young women ride off to town, Karin in her finery carrying candles for the church, Ingeri in her rags many months pregnant with the child of someone who had forced himself upon her, her heart full of jealousy and hate.  She has prayed to Odin for harm to come to Karin, for Karin to be taken against her will as she was, for Karin to suffer the humiliation and the pain that she suffered.  In fact she has worked a little black magic with a toad in the bread that Karin takes with her.

She says to Karin, it could happen to you if a man puts his hands on your neck and around your waist.  But Karin says no she would rebuff such a man, and when she is with child she will be happily married to a man of substance and privilege.  But the man is stronger and will take you behind a bush and you won't be able to fight him off, Ingeri insists.  Karin slaps her for such insolence.

This is a foreshadowing of events to come.  But first they come upon a bridge keeper, an old shamanistic man living alone, a man who collects medicinal herbs and feeds the ravens.  He represents the old Norse gods.  While they are there Ingeri decides she can't go on.  Karin leaves and the bridge keeper presses close to Ingeri to enthrall her with the black magic of the old gods.  But she becomes frightened and runs away.

The thing that stays with me the most is the pure animal brutality of the two herders.  They had only a sense of greed and ignorance about them.  They raped and murdered and stole, and then stupidly sealed their own fate.  They seemed almost subhuman.

Von Sydow's Tore is almost like a Norse God.  And when he confronted God with ""You saw this!"" he spoke for everyone who has ever suffered a grievous harm and has wondered why God let it happen.  Of course he represents along with his wife, Christianity.

The other thing that stays with me is the harsh life that these Swedes from the 14th century had to live.  One imagines how short the spring and how long the winter.  And one understands Karin's desire to have fun after being cooped up all winter.  The terrible irony that is at the heart of the human condition is this hope of spring which everyone feels so powerfully; and then to have this senseless tragedy ensue defies explanation.

But an explanation is attempted.  Bergman points to the girl's vanity and her naivety, to the mother's jealousy of the father who is more loved by Karin, to the way they look down on Ingeri and treat her like a serf who has sinned.  Or even to the palpable presence of evil in the world.  But the real explanation belongs to something naturalistic, primeval, something dark and cold and bestial in the Swedish woods, something before civilization and before the rule of law.

Indelible is Gunnel Lindblom's Ingeri, a woman-child of the devil almost (Odin would be like the devil to these medieval Christians), embittered and full of hate, but with such an animal presence.  The carefully plotted story that allows her to watch her desire for revenge come to life in front of her eyes and then to have her cry out later in guilt and blame herself for what she had done heightens our involvement and deepens the complex tragedy.

Bottom line: one of Bergman's best and that is very good indeed.",1202342400,5,4728,4.52414605418139

208741,5,6300150151,"Yes, you can definitely see Kurosawa's influence reigning over this Bergman film--a kind of, Bergman does ""Rashomon""--at least, visually--full of primal angst, man against man, man against woman, woman against woman, woman against society, father against child,, husband against wife, man against God--the whole arena in a tight little structure--with the force of Bergman's own vision filling out the tremulous daylight and the grim shadowed night. This could only ever be a black and white film.

I had one problem with it which I never fully resolved in my viewing (besides sometimes not being able to read the subtitles fast enough): the premise that any medieval father with so much love for his daughter could allow her to so simply go off on a long trek basically on her own--actually, insisting that she do so-- except this particular time, accompanied only by a woman no one trusted, and rightly so. The naive, young (how old is she anyway? teenager?), attractive, virgin daughter travels on horseback through a dark forest--and in fine apparel, no less--bypassing lecherous, creepy older men--practically trolls--and the suggestion is, that she's done this on many other occasions, attracting the attention of all the men of the area, some courting and some near-assaulting her. And spending the night in town sometimes! With who? Hey, who's more naive? The daughter or the father? Dad naive? Maybe blind would be more accurate. Perhaps, that's the whole tragedy of the story.

The only way I got myself over that implausible setup is to recognize how much this is a fairy tale--this is the sometimes-told, gruesome version of Red Ridinghood in which grandma gets eaten viciously and the rescuing woodsman savagely hacks away at the wolf finding parts of grandma inside.  Young, naive women in dark forests alone--the substance of folklore--and this time, the grim Grimm's.

I've just started my viewing of Bergman's oeuvre. First with Seventh Seal, and now this one. Seem like good movies to start with. Black and white, stark, with the themes bold and pronounced over the shady landscape, and Bergman's touch much more than simply apparent. It's wonderful to spend time with real directorial genius again.

I absolutely loved the very short scene with Sydow tearing down the birch tree in this one. What a great image. Look forward to it!

Excuse me, but I have to ask some of the other reviewers, including the professionals, is there a reason to tell the whole story in your reviews? Don't you realize that, for a lot of us, that spoils one of the most significant pleasures of watching a film? It's greatly unwelcome. The best reviews always avoid doing that. It's really, at all times, unnecessary. If you feel the need to tell the whole story, write a book about it, not a review. This is not an after-viewing group discussion board. It's a place where people come to see if the movie's worth watching, worth purchasing, not to find out how it ends.",1187395200,2,2966,4.969758064516129
208742,5,6300150151,"Not a typical film from recently deceased Swedish director Ingmar Bergman - and maybe that is the reason why I liked this movie so much, and why is not so well regarded among Bergman fans. Set in Medieval Sweden, the story is inspired by a 13th century ballad and is refreshingly simple: On her way to church, a beautiful young girl is raped and killed by two desperate shepherds, accompanied by a 13 year old boy. Unfortunately for them, they would later take shelter in the home of the girl's father (Max von Sydow, in a fine performance). When he learns they are her daughter's killers, he will take justice by his own hands, killing them as well as the innocent boy. In the place where the girl was murdered, a spring miraculously appears. The movie is oddly catholic (in Francoist Spain, this film was shown in churches), yet is moving, beautifully shot in black and white, unpretentious and straightforward.",1187308800,,913,4.7125

Based on the 14th - century Swedish legend, ""Virgin Spring"" is a moving and haunting tragic story about a young girl who was raped and killed while on the journey to the church. The killers unknowingly asked for the shelter at her parents' house... One of three was a young boy who only watched the crime.

Max von Sydow gives one of his best performances as an outraged father. Ingmar Bergman and his genius cinematographer Swen Nykwist reconstructed the medieval world full of realities and life, stunningly beautiful and deadly dangerous in the same time.

208744,4,6300150151,I saw this film after finding out that Last House On the Left was based on it so I was curious. It seems like every few years I rent LHOTL forgetting which film it was because they package it cleverly to look like something with a much bigger budget.  I end up watching it again and it creeps the hell out of me every time. Part of it is because they inadvertantly nail that early 70's drugged out and willing to do anything evil Manson Family kind of culture to a T.  I was fascinated by the idea of the same story in 12 or 13th century Sweden. I watched it once and it does have an eerieness of it's own and the style is unforgettable. At first I though it was good but not great but then I found myself wanting to put myself through it again. It is not as graphic as LHOTL - even with the infamous rape scene... so it doesn't have that horrific Faces of Death feel to it like the remake does. I am not going to bother to talk about the storyline since so many others here have... but I wanted to tell people that are watching it via LHOTL that they will be fascinated by it.,1175990400,2,1077,4.02803738317757
208745,5,6300150151,"I am just becoming acquainted with Bergman films. This was the first one I ever saw. I liked it better than the Seventh Seal. I've also seen Wild Strawberries, which I also enjoyed. The Virgin Spring, in my opinion, is the strongest of the three.

Like someone else said in their post, I can never get tired of this film. It is remarkable how you can always find something in a film that you didn't see the first time. I think that film is beautifully crafted. It's beautiful visually and the story is very compelling.

A brief synopsis of the film: the story is set in 14th century Sweden. Sweden is in a transition from Norse pantheism to Christianity. A young girl, Karin, and her foster sister, Ingeri, set out on their way to church one day so that Karin can offer some candles to the Virgin Mary. On the way to Church, Karin and Ingeri have a small disagreement. It seems that Karin was enjoying herself too much at a dance the night before, and that the man who may be the father of Ingeri's child had flirted with her, thus making making Ingeri jealous. So Ingeri stays behind and Karin goes alone. Before Karin reaches the church, she meets up with two desperate goatherds and their little brother. Karin is very friendly but also very nave. She feels pity for the goatherds and offers to share her lunch with them. They accept her offer only under the condition that she joins them. She agrees, not realizing what they really have in mind. It's obvious that as she is eating with them, Karin begins to feel uncomfortable with the way the two older goatherds have suddenly changed their demeanor towards her and the way they are looking at her. Eating is the last thing on the minds of the two men. They both rape her and then one of them kills her by hitting her over the head with a club. Ingeri has managed to find Karin, and she watches as the goatherds rape and kill her. It's obvious at this point that Ingeri does not really and truly want Karin to be harmed, despite her previous wishes. She watches in frozen horror, too shocked and frightened to do anything to help her sister. After it is over, Ingeri runs back home, but she is too afraid and feeling too guilty to tell her foster parents right away. She hides until she is found by her foster father. In a strange twist of fate, the goatherds end up asking for shelter at Karin's home. During the course of the evening, Karin's parents learn about what has happened to their daughter, unbeknownst to the goatherds. Despite their Christian beliefs, the parents exact their revenge on the two men. Sadly, the father also cruelly kills the younger brother. The boy is not responsible in any way for Karin's rape and murder, and he is also a victim. He is only guilty by association in the father's eyes. Immediately after killing the boy, the father realizes that he has gone too far. He later promises to God to atone for his sins.

This movie is just so powerful. It made such an impact on me. I was Karin as a young girl. I was nave and bit spoiled and coddled as a child and teenager. I was also resented by siblings. I mean, my siblings loved me and still do, but I understand the situation between Karin and Ingeri so well. In the beginning of the story, Karin seems vain, selfish, and nave. She's pretty and more privileged than her foster sister, Ingeri. I felt so much pity for Ingeri. Ingeri is never allowed to forget that this family is kind enough to take her in as one of their own. She is also ""damaged goods."" This is medieval Sweden and Ingeri is unmarried and pregnant. She feels very much trapped in the world that she is in, and there is no hope to escape it. It is never revealed who the father of Ingeri's child is. We don't know if she is pregnant because she was raped or if she has willingly engaged in sex before being married. Karin even makes an insulting remark to her early in the film about her condition. Karin asks Ingeri if the baby ""hurts"" her, and Ingeri tells her that she will find out for herself one day. Karin then offers a mean retort. She tells her that when that day does come, she will be married with ""honor"" and mistress of her own home. (Ouch!)This probably will not be the case for Ingeri!

Early in the film, Ingeri's jealousy and pain make her wish for something bad to happen to her sister. I think that these are normal human emotions. When something bad does happen to Karin, Ingeri is immediately sorry.

This is a wonderful, sad, timeless film that is truly a work of art.",1175212800,10,4497,4.406738868832732
208746,5,6300150151,"I make no claim to be an expert on movies, but I know a good one when I see it and The Virgin Spring is just one more of the powerful, deeply moving masterpieces I've had the pleasure of viewing lately.

I won't rehash the plot, but I will comment on things worthy of notice not really mentioned by other reviewers.

1)What is the symbolism in Odin-worship of the frog? Notice how the kid got sick after tasting the bread that had sandwiched the frog?

2)Note how the prayer said before the meal had a powerful affect on the same kid. Only he seems to remember its the same prayer said when Karin shared her food with the goatherds. See that he is the only one of the goatherds with a semblance of a conscience because of how he reacts.

3)See how carefree and guileless Karin was in the presence of the goatherds until the one mentioned how lovely her waist was. Perhaps at that point she remembers what her half-sister had said about the impossibility of maintaining virtue when confronted by determined and half-savage rapists. Karin was kind of spoiled. One thing her folks didn't teach her was the ways of the world.

4)Note how Karin's mother kept her head when presented with her daughter's garments for sale, saying she would have to consult with her husband on the proper price for such a valuable gown. Once she managed to leave the manor-house where the goatherds were sheltering overnight without breaking down, she then had the presence of mind to bar the door so that the guilty could not escape. She did such a good job hiding her feelings that the goatherds felt safe enough to fall asleep.

5)Note how the father removed his daughter's things from the murderer's bag and laid them on the table, waiting for the murderers to awaken so he could confront them and so the ostensible guests would know why they were to be killed. His impatience didn't allow him to wait for them to awaken, however, and he finished them off with hard struggle after awakening them himself. Vengeance is one of the movie's themes. The father's religious beliefs made him feel guilty. But in the absence of an established legal system, what else could he do? He couldn't bring his daughter back but the guilty certainly received their condign punishments.

His foster-daughter was lucky that he allowed her to live after what she told him about the rape/slaying of his daughter. But how would he regard her from that point on?

6)Then there is the religious symbolism at the end where the spring burst forth from where the murdered girl's head lay after her father proclaimed to the heavens his intention to build a church on the spot with his bare hands.

There are a lot of other instances throughout the movie fraught with symbolism and I'm sure I missed some of them. But beyond the artistic beauty of the film and the quality of the performances, there is much food for thought offered the viewer if only he or she will partake of it. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants something beyond mindless entertainment from their movie experiences. It is certainly a film I will watch again.",1171929600,6,3089,4.622262773722627
208747,5,6300150151,"One of his early films, what I find compelling about Bergman's Virgin Spring is its apparent pure simplicity in a story told with economy and a minimum of dialogue, and yet the great depth of emotion and character that is revealed within this spare fable. The telling detail of each of the leads is revealed in small, fleeting moments, with a look or gesture.  The film's themes of love and jealousy, of want and privilege, of violence and vengeance, of faith and despair are told in brief touches, and no character is presented in simple terms, but rather display counter-intuitive but completely human traits.

The cast, lead by the always strong and impressive Max Von Sydow, is fine.  The black and white photography by Sven Nykvist is, as usual, exquisite.  The medieval costume and sets convincing. The assault and murder as presented within this 1960 film is still terrible to watch.  The subsequent vengeance is troubling.  The questioning of God but the final surrender to faith understandable.

Reading my fellow reviewers, I note that some say this is Bergman's most accessible film, and possibly not as highly rated by his admirers.  Well, I agree to the former but not with the latter.  And I caution that its accessiblity does not mean it is without depth. Every action here has consequence.  Nothing is simple and clear-cut.  We cry out for vengeance, but Bergman undercuts our emotion when the father goes one act too many.  Innocense is destroyed, and in the face of such abject despair how can life go on?  And yet a spring spills forth and somehow solace and renewal must be found.

I had not seen this film in 20 years and upon watching it again I was struck by the power of a simple story, beautifully told.",1169510400,6,1728,4.735785953177258

208749,4,6300150151,"Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring, is a cold-hearted, dramatic document mirroring unfortunate sordid headlines of today's news, in it's tragic story of a young medieval Swedish girl assaulted by a group of ruffians on her way to church. Too many real-life young girl abductions come to mind as the camera painfully reveals the aftermath of the tragedy, which starts off as innocently as a tea party with Alice in Wonderland, and ends with a disturbing, realistic visual, that remains one of the most unsettling, lurid sights ever captured on dramatic film. The two young actresses, Brigitta Pettersson, as the young victim, and Gunnel Lindblom, as her pagan worshipping stepsister, offer exemplary acting performances, and while the revenge aspect of the drama seems common, Bergman's examination of an active, involved, and strangely sympathetic Pagan religion, contrasts well with the merciless, empty sky-full of Christian belief that ends the film.",1158192000,5,970,5.473333333333334
208750,5,6300150151,"How is it possible for god to exist in such an unjust world? - Bergman's constant question of the 1960's begins in the 'Virgin Spring'. Bergman at first planned this to be part of his trilogy - which would begin with 'Through a Glass Darkly' - but the problem is it also feels like his earlier works. It is a period piece like the 'Seventh Seal'.

The movie falls so neatly between the chamber pieces to come, and the works of Bergman's past.

'The Virgin Spring' is one of Bergman's strangest and darkest movies - it looks at rape and violence in a way that is shocking for 1960. It is quite typical in the moral questions it presents - but typical is never the right word to describe the works of Bergman.",1142121600,6,707,4.30827067669173
208751,5,6300150151,"Bergman was the son of a Christian pastor and a lifelong atheist.  He spent considerable intellectual capital trying to work out why humans were so desperate for a God.  He also devoted significant artistic effort to depicting a world where people call out to God but God doesn't answer.

The Virgin Spring is set in medieval Sweden, a time when Christianity was ascendant, but some people still prayed to their old pagan gods.  In the opening scene, Ingeri, a foster daughter, invokes Odin to call down a curse on Karin, the favored only child.  In the next scene, we see the patriarch Tore (Max Von Sydow) and his wife Mareta (Birgitta Valberg) praying to a lurid statue of Christ on the cross.  The rest of the movie goes deep into this tension between the forbearance of Jesus and the bloody justice of the Norse pagan gods.

The story, based on a 13th century Swedish ballad, is simple and stark.  Karin, accompanied by Ingeri, sets off to deliver some candles to the church.  While riding through the woods they get separated.  Ingeri meets an old hermit, a pantheist, who shows her his secret stash of magic relics.  Repulsed, she flees deeper into the forest.  Karin meets two goatherds and their younger brother, and offers to share her lunch with them.  They lead the nave girl to a glade by a stream, and there they rape and murder her.  They strip her of her fine clothing, intending to sell it, and flee.

Unfortunately for them, the first farm they come to is Tore's.  Unaware of what has happened, Tore gives them dinner and a bed for the night.  After dinner, the goatherds offer Karin's blood stained dress for sale to her mother.  Hiding her shock, she hurries away to tell Tore.  Without hestitation, Tore prepares himself with a purifying bath, then bursts into the guesthouse and takes revenge on the goatherds.  In a final act of rage, he kills their younger brother as well.

Ingeri returns during the night, and the next day she leads them to Karin's body.  When Tore lifts up his daughter's corpse, an underground spring gushes forth from beneath her. In a masterful scene, shot almost entirely from behind Tore, we watch him absorb the emotional impact of his daughter's death like a body blow.  He raises supplicating hands to demand of his God why He let this happen.  He then decides to build a sturdy church on this spot.  It's his way of trying to control and appease the inexplicable evil that has descended upon his life, and, perhaps, his way of atoning for the evil he has done in return.

Christianity has struggled for centuries with this simple question: if God is so just, all-powerful and merciful, why does he allow so much evil to exist in this world?  Christianity's most pernicious and effective response is found in the story of Job.  It's pernicious because it blames the victim for his own misfortune, which is all the justification generations of psychopaths, warlords and totalitarians have needed to inflict their evil on innocent people who can't or won't strike back.  It's effective because it locates the response to misfortune in the only place a human can control, which is his own reaction to what befalls him.  Bergman, like Dostoievski's great apostates, cannot respect a God who allows the rape and murder of a young girl.  Not respecting, he also doesn't believe.

For Bergman, nothing exists beyond human actions and their consequences.  Tore knows that killing the goatherds won't assuage his anguish, and that killing the boy is morally questionable at best.  Yet neither he nor Mareta hesitates in the slightest when it comes time to take revenge.  Bergman is showing us what a difficult God this Jesus is.  As Dostoievski pointed out so brilliantly in The Grand Inquistor chapter of the Brothers Karamazov, Jesus is both too much like us to obey without question and too pure in his responses to emulate successfully.  In the end, having taken a bloodthirsty, pagan revenge, Tore is praying to a God whose example he can't follow and who can't or won't protect him from the suffering of this world.  These intellectual contradictions and emotional conundrums are the polluted springs from which flowed the dour, life-denying Christian Protestantism inflicted on Bergman as a boy.

This is the first feature length collaboration between Bergman and Sven Nykvist.  Nykvist captures the war of sunlight and shadow that occurs during early spring in the northern latitudes.  He also provides some vivid tracking shots through the latticework of the unleafed forest.  Lingering closeups on faces became a Bergman trademark.  Here they work to great effect, showing us Karin's spoiled innocence, Ingeri's conflicted resentment, Tore's ambivalent rage.

The Virgin Spring is one of Bergman's greatest achievements.  By refusing to impose a viewpoint on his simple story, he gives us the room we need to absorb its tragic and universal dimensions.  This movie stays with you long after the credits stop rolling.",1142035200,72,4969,4.8970059880239525
208752,5,6300150151,"If there is any theme in life of which one can never tire it is of the interplay between good and evil. The epic battle is the subject of The Virgin Spring, and that is partially what makes it a subtle masterpiece. What I personally found most illuminating about this particular version of the film is the commentary included which one can select to have roll in the background. It comes from a Swedish professor and I found her analysis fascinating. Her insight reveals much about both film and auteur. The purposeful, focused craftsmanship of Bergmann is quite pronounced as very shot and angle appears to have been the result of serious assessment. The tale is set against the backdrop of the medieval struggle between Paganism and Christianity for dominance in Sweden. Despite the country's new devotion to Christ, Odin remains a powerful force as his ravens peer out at the characters. The symbolism is perhaps more important than the plot, but Bergman's mastery prevents the production from appearing contrived. As for the actors and actresses, I like Von Sydow in everything, even though the director later thought his performance overstated. The rest of the cast is outstanding. Also, the beauty of the landscape is something which constantly pleased and was most notable in the scene with Von Sydow wrestling with the birch tree. I guess, when judging the character of many films critics, I'm not surprised that The Virgin Spring was not liked by them, but it does highlight the fact that genius often goes unrecognized in its time. That Bergman bought into some of their negativity is a disappointment though.",1141603200,3,1619,4.955882352941177
208753,5,6300150151,"It is surprising. Yet, this is the gist of ""The Virgin Spring"", a film based on the 13th century Scandinavian ballad ""Tore's Daughter at Vange"", recounting the rape of a virgin girl, the father's revenge and a spring miraculously flowing from the spot where she is killed.

What at first may seem an ordinary tale becomes a sublime morality play, thanks to director Ingmar Bergman's incorporation of symbolic images, psychological tension and imaginative cinemagraphic techniques, fittingly designed so as to complement cameraman Sven Nykvist natural, three-dimensional style.  Bergman then puts this all to great effect by pitting Christian virtues of kindness, purity and familial love against the savagery and superstitions of Norse paganism.

He portrays New Testament symbols through the patriarch Tore (Max von Sydow) reciting grace while sitting at the centre of the dining table in a manner reminiscent of Da Vinci's portrait of The Last Supper. His wife Margeta's (Birgitta Valberg) piety is shown when she prays before a crucifix, then inflicts pain upon herself to suffer Christ's agony. Their daughter  Karin's (Birgitta Pettersson) innocence is reflected in a clean-faced girl dressed in a silken dress made by ""fifteen seamstresses"" and the grace she recites before the goatherds when she breaks and shares bread with them.

In contrast, paganism is portrayed in the pregnant foster sister Ingeri (Gunnel Lindblom) whose face is besmirched and dressed in an unadorned and dirty garment. She curses Karin by invoking the Norse god of death and war Odin, then places a toad in a loaf of bread (symbols of death and the devil), not so much out of pagan ritual, but jealousy and spite of her. When Ingeri meets a sinister old man whose home in the ford is filled with Viking idols, he foretells the fate of Karin and the goatherds as though he were Odin answering her supplication. Lastly, the coarse, ragged and filthy goatherds trample the gleaming white candles Karin intended to deliver to the church, signifying their savagery.

To delineate goodness from a filmic point of view, Bergman shows nothingness all around to focus attention on the actor's character role. The scene of Tore wrestling a lone birch tree to the ground and stripping its branches is one such example. He does this also when Karin is riding a horse and the sea is set in the background. This is Bergman at his best painting a metaphor of Karin's purity and the father's rite of purification. We see this motif again at the end when Ingeri gathers the spring water into her hands and cleanses her face as though to absolve herself.

As for evilness, the depiction of the rape scene is disturbing, just as it should be, but not as overtly graphic as many films have since become on this subject. The scene, which was edited when it was first shown and released for subsequent home videos, is shown in its entirety to underscore the violation of Karin's chastity, the despicable crime and wickedness of the goatherds.

The same holds true of Tore avenging Karin's rape. Bergman doesn't bloody the camera lens. He lets us see the patriarch's tense facial expressions and brute physical strength as he thrusts the dagger into one brother, burns another in an open fire and throws the youngest against a wall.  It is Old Testament vengeance exacted for a sin, equally as violent as the rape, but at the same time it is Bergman's way of adding psychological tension and posing a moral dilemma to the viewer. Who has the right to kill another human being? Why did God let this happen?

For some, the death of their only child in the forest may prove too heart wrenching. Others may find solace in the spring that gurgles forth once Tore lifts Karin's head -- hence the title, ""the Virgin...Spring"". Interestingly, there is a church and spring in Karna, central Sweden said to be the spot where this incident occurred, just as Tore vows to God he would build as penance for the deaths of the goatherds.

So, there you have it, a tense, thought provoking and cathartic film! It's one of Bergman's best, and the perfect companion film to ""The Seventh Seal"".

Moreover, Criterion has put together a rather comprehensive DVD package. With this superbly remastered film is a 28-page booklet featuring essays from film scholar Peter Cowrie and screenwriter Ulla Isaksson, along with a letter from Bergman on the controversial rape scene and the poem ""Tore's Daughter at Vange"".

208754,5,6300150151,"Great art can have a transforming effect on the psyche when it proceeds from a collaboration of the intellect and the emotions towards an honest pursuit for the truth. The Virgin Spring is a great work of art that illustrates the possibilities of cinema. Whether or not one is familiar with the story, this is not a story driven film, nor is it character driven film. It is completely the director's film. The characters react to events beyond their control, beyond their understanding and that is the story. That is life. The film takes place during the middle ages, when Christianity was in the process of vanquishing the old Pagan religions which were firmly rooted in the power of Nature. There is great beauty in Nature but also mystery and danger. All of this is exquisitely captured by the brilliant camera work of Sven Nykvist, where practically every scene is a photographic masterpiece. We are introduced to a devout Christian family, their servants, and the centerpiece of the film, their spoiled daughter Karin who is the pride and joy of their lives. Equally important is Ingrid, their unwed God child who is visibly pregnant. Wild and volatile, Karin is a child of Nature, caught between the Old Norse Gods of her past and the new Christian God of her adopted caretakers. Though it is never directly dealt with in the film, it is insinuated that Ingrid was robed of her virginity in a violent act. As a consequence, she develops an acute jealous hatred of Karin, specifically of her ""unspoiled"" innocence. In fact, the film opens with her invoking the old Norse God Odin to smite her rival; an invocation that will have profound implications, indeed a sin that will only be forgiven in a miraculous baptismal event that is the Virgin Spring! And so the film proceeds like a funeral procession in the midst of joyous life - where love breeds jealousy, jealousy breeds hatred, hatred results in violence, which in turn reasserts itself with revenge, and only after all is lost, reflection. In the end a father reaching helplessly into the sky laments: ""You saw it! God you saw it! The death of an innocent child and my vengeance. You allowed it to happen. I don't understand you. I don't understand you! And still I ask of your forgiveness. I know no other way to make peace with myself, than with my own hands. I know no other way to live.""",1139356800,3,2353,4.699757869249395
208755,5,6300150151,"""The Virgin Spring"" is as powerful a movie as Ingmar Bergman has made and as world cinema has to offer. Shot in black-and-white, it is brutal and beautiful at the same time. And because it is an impeccably constructed period piece, it looks like it was made last week instead of in 1959. Its 2006 re-release on DVD from The Criterion Collection, in the full-length uncensored director's cut, will surely become the standard for Bergman students and gain a wider audience.

Bergman has taken a brief Norse ballad and, aided by novelist Ulla Isaksson, turned it into a medieval tapestry threaded with good and evil, guilt and innocence, terror and atonement. A young girl (Birgitta Pettersson) is raped and murdered while journeying through the countryside; her parents (Max von Sydow, Birgitta Valberg) take a terrible revenge on the three killers, one a mere boy. That's the tale, but Bergman has extended and deepened it by enlarging the context, that of one set of superstitions replacing another (Christianity replacing Paganism.)

Seen today, the rape and murder sequence that caused such controversy and censorship in 1960 America (but not elsewhere) is standard stuff; nevertheless, it is still harrowing, as is the parents' vengeance. ""The Virgin Spring"" is Bergman's first collaboration with photographer Sven Nykvist, who would shoot his subsequent films. Their miracle of a movie ends, appropriately, with a miracle, and its release ended with an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

And the legendary rape scene essentially has one of three bandits taking advantage of the girl, but he doesn't so much as remove his trousers.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but don't criminals like these ""share"" their victim?  Okay, it was made in a day before online smut, so we're not going to see too much explicit material here (thank goodness), but this film doesn't strike me as being all that transcendentally ""deep"" as its reputation would have it.

If someone violently violated your daughter, you wouldn't waste any time getting revenge in those days.  Oh sure, you might go to the local lord, maybe get the town watch or something, but if you were out away from the castle, with essentially no lord, or one who was very far away, and you yourself had a societal status akin to a knight or a man-at-arms, then you'd dish your own justice and would be quick about it.  You wouldn't wrestle with a tree, hem-haw, brood, think about it, and what not.  You'd whip out your sword and cut these miscreants to bloody shreds.

This movie and the review I'm writing reminds me of the review I wrote for MacBeth.  Another flatus-brained story where major plot holes really torpedo what might have been a better film.  With Macbeth it was the king's general acting like some schizophrenic warrior who was brave and strong one day, and then a complete scheming idiot the next who then blames his wife for the whole thing.  With The Virgin Spring there seems to be an attempt to make more out of a typical sexual assault case than is actually there.

I think a more ... not ""better"", but perhaps more reasonable or believable film would have been for Max Von Sydow's character to go hunting after these scoundrels after they had had their way and tried to make off by covering up their crime, because otherwise there's no real film here.  Oh sure, it's well shot, its directed by Bergman, it's in black and white, it's a foreign film, it shows (as best for the time in a G-rated sort of way) a pretty foul crime, and whatever else you want to toss in there.  But even for the 1960s these thing is pretty tame.

The Raisuli theory is that people went to this film hoping to see some sex.  Instead what they got was a film meant for fathers, husbands and other males who's female loved ones had been taken advantage of, and they weren't there to stop it.  Well, okay, if that's the film you want to make, then great.  But remember that there's another portion of people who want to see an actual story, and not just some cinematic visual cartharsis, or, to paraphrase George Lucas, ""A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.""  Meaning no matter what visuals you're presenting, you need a story, and just a story, but a compelling one.  This story is not compelling.

Whatever.  I bought a copy because I had heard of it and was, at the time, interested in making a series of medieval shorts, and thought I should see other films of the genre.  Well, this one isn't worth much.  And I say that without any apologies to film snobs the world over who heap high praises on the director.  Not everything he did was stamped with a gold leaf seal of approval folks, and this film shows that.",1501977600,,3355,4.464696223316913
7802954,5,6300150151,"Astonishing in every way. I won't review the film, because there is no point in praising one of the greatest movies in the canon. I will only say that I was surprised, even knowing that I would be, that I was affected by the rape scene. There is no nudity involved. There is minimal violence involved. What there is is superb acting. With almost no music in the entire film, we have only characters, and we KNOW and feel the innocence of Karin, the rape victim. We know her brattiness is childishness rather than wickedness. We recognize, in minimal strokes, the pride of her father. We see, with astonishing economy, the separate ways of dealing with a child's death.
The Criterion Collection's ""extras"" live up to their reputation. The alternate audio commentary is non-intrusive, non-pedantic, synced, and clear. The included AFI interview is entertaining and illuminating of Bergman's personality and approach (if not ""The Virgin Spring"" especially). The interviews with surviving actresses from the film are interesting.
There is no real excuse for buying any truncated, untrustworthy, less expensive version of ""The Virgin Spring."" This has censored seconds that make all the difference and a gorgeous print.",1500768000,5,1214,5.16751269035533

7802960,5,6300150151,"""The Virgin Spring"" is a great adaptation by Ingmar Bergman of the famous swedish ballad of the 13th century called""Tore's daughter of Vange"". It is reminiscent of the famous Icelandic sagas where the struggle between Good and Evil is always the underlining theme.. Here we see the struggle between the principles of the Christian Faith of purity, holiness, chastity and innocence as represented in the character of Karin, the daughter of the Christian parents Tore and Margreta. Karin is the embodiment of the purity of the christian faith as she was so pure and innocent, and we see that clearly when she offered to have a meal with the evil men not knowing or even suspecting their evil intentions. Karin as a Christian girl utters a beautiful prayer to The Lord and God Jesus Christ askingg his blessings on the meal, but the evil men to the contrast don't even pretend to pray. It is a clear contrast between the Holiness as reoresented by the Christian Faith in contrast with the unbelief and atheism of the gotherds who d8n't share Karin's Faith in the Powerful, Ever Living God, and thus they don't respect the innocence and goodness of this pure Young lady. It also shows the honesty and the Truthfulness of The Christian young lady Karin compared the evil, devious nature of the atheist men who didn't even respect the fact that they had eaten with the girl, and in the middle ages when people eat together and share bread together they shouldn't cheat each other.
  On the other hand , we see Tore who even though he had become a Christian, yet he still carries the barbatism of paganism in him, as he forgets that the veneance is the Lord's not him, and as he forgets that the Lord never promises that his people ard not going to be hurt by evil but that he rewards his followers eternal life and He is the one who inflicts the just punishment on the evil. So, we see Tore takes justice on his own hands and kill the rapists and killers of his daughter even the young boy who had no say on the events. We see another contrast between Christianity as represented in the Holiness and Purity of Karin in contrast with the perfideous nature of Ingmer who was presented as a pregnant young woman and who out of jealousy of Karin is praying to the false pagan god odin in contrast with Karin's prayer to The Powerful Ever-Living God Jesus Christ. Moreover, in the middle ages and even in the purtanical swedish society of the 1950's for a young woman to become pregnant without marriage was a greatly shameful act compared with the Virginity of Karin that was the embodiment of the idealism of Christianity.
  Margreta, as the mother represented a real Christian mother who taught her daughter to be pure and Holy, but forgot to teach her to beware of the evil that is is the world particularly of the unbelievers who are always jealous and hateful of the Christian purity and Holiness. As we see thag Ingmer the jealous foster daughter of Tore and Margreta watch the rape and murder of Karin without trying to do anything to save her. It was only after Tore had killed the three evil men men that she took him and Margreta and some of their neighbors to the place where the body of Karin was. At the sight of Karin's body, Tore who is still influenced by paganism starts blaming God for the evil crimes of men, yet we see that his Christian faith takes hold of him and he decides to build a Church where the Holy Name of The Lord and God Jesus christ will forever be mentioned in that place, in order to purify it from the evil and heinous crime that was committed by evil men.
  The last scene, where we see the spring of pure water gushes forth from under the head of tge pure Lady Karin, as if to say that out of the Holiness and Purity of Christianity gushes forth a pure spring the cleanses from sin and evil in contrast of the sterility and vagueness of atheisn and paganism that produce nothing but rape, murder and all evil. It also shows that Lord Jesus Christ to whom Karin prayed hadn't forgotten to honor her as she had honored him. It is said that this a true story and there is an ancient church that was built in meridional Sweden by the Tore the father of the slain girl as a penance for taking the life of his daughter's rapists and killers. It is another token of the Love spread by the Christian faith , that made Tore repent of the evil that he had committed by taking justice into his own hands in cpntrast with evilness of atheism and lack of faith the evil men who didn't have any guilt or remorse for what they had done to the Pure Karin, The Christian Lady.",1463097600,,4589,4.444180522565321
