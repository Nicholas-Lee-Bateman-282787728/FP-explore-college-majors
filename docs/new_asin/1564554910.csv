7796442,5,1564554910,I absolutely loved watching this VHS even though age has taken a toll on the quality of the tape. The information in the brochure included with the VHS was invaluable. Learning about music thanatology before my mother passed away made it possible for me to request this service for her by Kindred Hospice. Having the music thanatologist play her harp at my mother's beside transformed my experience of my mother's passing from sorrow to joy.,1501891200,,441,4.8933333333333335
7796443,2,1564554910,"When I received this video, I was disappointed that the video was on a cassette and not in DVD format.  The video content is great but cassette format is outdated.  It was not made clear that the video format is on a cassette.",1362182400,,226,4.232558139534884
7796444,5,1564554910,"Therese Schroeder-Sheker is a gifted harpist, singer and composer.  Her Chalice of Repose project located in Montana is so important for the dying and should be something available all over America. Anyone who works in Hospice care or who understands the the healing power of music should get this video.  The scenes of Montana were just gorgeous.  And when Ms. Sheker sings, you can tell how much she loves music and believes in it as a form of spirituality.  I have been in contact with the Chalice of Repose staff, alot of nice people who work there.  If you enjoy the music of Enya or Loreena Mckennitt then I recommend Therese Schroeder-Sheker's music on CD. I have most of her music and it is soothing and peacefull.  I hope she may release more music in the future.",1033516800,13,772,4.598540145985401
7796445,5,1564554910,"The Chalice of Repose is such a beautiful documentary.  On the musician's  contemplative practice of music thanantology, which is playing prescriptive  music for the dying.  Therese's voice is angelic, and the harp music is so  serene.  I hope when it is my time to pass, that there will be something  like this for me.  I've seen this video about 10 times, and it amazes me  everytime.  If you enjoy beautiful vocal and harp music, or have an  interest in the medical field, and care about dying patients, this video is  a definate must see!!!",965347200,13,544,4.670212765957447
7796446,4,1564554910,"As a hospice nurse for 15 years, I found Ms. Schroeder-Sheker insightful  and ""right on"" target with her observations of the goals of a  ""good death"".  Focusing on a safe sanctuary for the patient and  their loved ones including the peaceful atmosphere created by music allows  the patient and their loved ones to speak those important words of  reconciliation, love, and ultimate joy that the joining of their lives has  brought.  This video could be used as a background piece to any long term  care facility or residence or as a learning medium for caregivers who want  to create that ""safe sanctuary"".",962668800,9,605,4.8431372549019605
