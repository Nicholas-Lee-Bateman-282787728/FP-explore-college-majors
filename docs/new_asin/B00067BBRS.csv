8039807,2,B00067BBRS,"Just in case you didn't do any research and want to buy this movie simply because Steven Seagal's in it, be warned: this is not a Steven Seagal movie. Seagal's cumulative onscreen presence doesn't top five minutes in length, and with the exception of a momentary flash, you don't see him until the very end of the movie. That said, his presence is the sole highlight of a very muddled action-drama that's almost sure to disappoint the type of audience it's advertised to. This is neither a martial arts flick nor a cop/gangster movie, but a 90-minute soap opera with some disappointing fight scenes tossed in that Seagal barely contributes to.

The story: Kim (Lee Dong-Jun) is an alcoholic ex-cop raising his young daughter Sa Rang (Eun See-Woo) following the death of her mother. While Sa Rang befriends a female inspector (Kim Hye-Ri ,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Evil-Lake/dp/B0182ZY6JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Evil Lake</a>), Kim falls into servitude of a crime lord determined to push him into a high-paying fight with King of the Cage champion Jack Miller (Seagal).

Dong-Jun, Hye-Ri, See-Woo, and director Kim Du-Yeong are not well-known in Korean show business, and it's easy to see why, since nobody performs their job beyond an acceptable level. Dong-Jun is vaguely interesting in channeling a Chow Yun-Fat screw-up character (similar to one Seagal would play four years later in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pistol-Whipped/dp/B0011VIO4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pistol Whipped</a>), but is too inconsistent to leave an impression. See-Woo may be commendable for pulling off the precocious little girl, but only if she doesn't creep you out with a couple uncomfortable scenes in which she wants to marry her father and tries to take his pants off for him (they're innocent circumstances, but I don't know why they're in the script in the first place). This soap opera acting lends itself to a literal soap opera storyline about Sa Rang's parentage, and no less than five scenes conclude with dramatic music playing and Sa Rang crying. This is definitely not what you're expecting when looking at the DVD cover.

I hoped that there would be some decent fight scenes to tide me over as I dealt with the weirdo soundtrack (classical orchestration, pop ballads, and heavy metal riffs all in the same movie!) and the ceaseless proclamations between Kim and Sa Rang, but to no avail. There are only two real hand-to-hand fights leading up to the Seagal-Kim encounter, and while these allow Lee to demonstrate some martial arts prowess, they're so atrociously filmed that you can't actually see much of the action. The climatic showdown in the cage is no better: Seagal looks a little better than he did in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-of-the-Beast/dp/B000006PAB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly of the Beast</a>, but the entire bout consists of either tight close-ups or stunt doubles filmed from a distance. Seagal's character takes a bit more of a beating than fans are used to, but Dong-Jun doesn't really get to show off. What's more, who wins the fight is left ambiguous.

Seagal has only a few lines of dialogue, and these are drowned out by the background music. Even for Seagal completionists, this film is not worth spending a lot of money for, since all of his scenes can now be found online. Spare yourselves.",1267401600,8,3503,5.5055762081784385
8039808,4,B00067BBRS,"Im a big fan of Mr. Seagal, and i couldn't miss a movie of him.

So i also bought Clementine (asia edition)

This movie has a pretty good played dramatic story-line.

Of a father that lost his wife and is stuck with his young daughter, they love eachother very much, but he cant be there for her every-minute, and thats a thing she wants.

It even gets worse when hes been treatend to do illegal fights if he wants to see her daughter again,he wins them all in a row, till the last one, The KING Steven Seagal(Seagal has honor)

1.) You want to buy the film because of Steven, you must be a real fan (like iam) hes in the movie for 8 min.

2.)The movie itself is good played , dramatic , nice storyline and suprising end.

If Seagal didn't played in this movie we (non-asia ppl) never knew about this title and didn't bought either,its just that Seagal played is an extra rush to Rent or Buy this movie.

I give the movie 3 stars, but with Seagal in it, he get a 4!
