8648763,1,B00J8LXCU2,"Well what can I say, this film longs for a place in that special category I call ""A terrible waste of film and natural resources"". If there was a plot I missed it, it was disjointed, characters kept popping in from who knows where as others got killed off.  Initially people are turning one a a time until at a point at the wedding when everyone turns a once, also the groom is sprayed at the same time his friend is and the only that turns in a zombie is the friend, amazing isn't it.  The Director who I believe is responsible for the flow from beginning to end should not quit there day job.  Its so bad it doesn't even qualify for camp.",1469232000,,640,4.145161290322581
8648764,4,B00J8LXCU2,"Well done for a low budget zombie movie. The gore was great(with some seriously gross moments), the acting was surprisingly pretty good (for most characters) and the plot was fluid and made sense.
I liked the Rockabilly theme which made for a great soundtrack and interesting characters. Good zombie fun!",1466726400,,304,5.1

8648768,3,B00J8LXCU2,"This is another zombie film that runs through the formula. The government sprays a toxic chemical which creates zombies through biting and infected insect bites. Grant (Daniel Baldock) and Becky (Christina Bach) are getting married that same day, in what may be an entry for the worst dressed wedding party contest. Bar tender Mom (Melissa Gruver) delays the wedding by fighting to get off work and that drug thing. About the time of the nuptial exchange,  things break loose. Characters well established for a zombie film.

On the plus side was the sound track, The film created a diversity of characters within the genre, but had less diversity than say ""Redneck Zombies.""  Unlike ""Redneck Zombies"" the film lacked the camp value that should have been there. The film needed to laugh at itself more and done more with their odd characters.

Would recommend as a rental.

Guide: F-bomb, groping, women eaten by zombie nudity.",1430697600,2,926,4.987012987012987
