The story is simple enough; criticisms almost variably focus on the film's message of racial and cultural equality.  Yes, the film has a message but it's presented in a very tasteful way. The movie makes it's pount without rubbing your nose in the obvious.

The characters in this film are also beautifully represented; they are robust personalities that you can relate to. I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie.

The special edition of Azur & Asmar seen in this listing is Korean and it region 3.  The set itself is wonderful; the book is high quality and contains stills taken from the film.  There is also a bonus dvd which personally I've never watched.

If you're looking for an affordable region free player I recommend the Philips 5690. I bought mine right here on amazon.  Google the model for further details.",1225497600,,1092,4.61139896373057
