2910127,1,B000TSTENC,"As is stands today, it is almost exactly DOUBLE the price to buy the set, than to buy the individual volumes separately.  Every now and then this set comes down to a reasonable price, but it seems that every time I look at it in my wish list, the price has changed.  One day it's $300, then it's $190, then it's $240, etc etc etc.  What gives?",1205280000,8,343,4.08955223880597
2910128,3,B000TSTENC,"I love the cartoons, but I didn't like the morality lesson I had to endure at the beginnings of volumes 3, 4, and 5. They really put a damper on my joy of viewing them. I felt guilty and THAT, everybody, is wrong. I could get into a lengthy discussion on how that guilt was elicited - between the authors' use of color and imagery - to make their Politically Correct message so effective, but I don't want to spoil my good mood. I would only like to say this to the publishers of these discs: it's too much! Let the bigots and racists make themselves examples of abhorrent behavior, don't shove your righteous messages down my unsuspecting throat!!

Anyway, I'm going to MP4 every short from all five volumes and put them on my iPod, so I'll never have to see those red-alerts (that's right, the backgrounds are RED, as if what they're telling us is coming straight from the police (or something).

Truth is, what's really going on is fear propaganda through use of color and imagery.) This is a case in which their intentions may be good, but their means of conveying them and their choice of venue is totally inappropriate. I just want the public to be aware of this kind of stuff. It's not right because it's potentially dangerous, and it should always be resisted. It's  like Darren Brown, the great English illusionist said, ""Question everything."" If you are passionate about the belief in democracy, free will, and free speech, that quote is not to be taken lightly.",1203552000,6,1472,4.5893536121673
2910129,3,B000TSTENC,"When it comes to classic animation, Warner Brothers has really hit the nail on the head with the Looney Tunes. Nevertheless, the animated gems have maintained a hard core audience with longtime die hard fans. Unfortunately, I wish I could say the same for younger audiences today, who seem to be more into acts like Spongebob Squarepants, and Jimmy Neutron on Nickelodeon. Sadly though, the classics have really influenced so much more today in animation, but the Looney Tunes gang doesn't get that credit where it really is due. Nevertheless, the previous box sets have all shined brightly from the Golden Collection, and now you could have all of them, including the newest, volume 5.

The Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volumes 1-5 consists of nearly 300 animated greats from Warner brothers classic era of animation. The collection includes classic cartoons that have been restored mostly well, but there were some audio problems in volume 1. The collection though includes classic gems like What's Opera Doc?, Chuck Jones masterpiece spoof of Vagner's operatic classics where Bugs & Elmer are going head to head through music and dance, and the Oscar-winning Speedy Gonzales where Speedy speeds his way to get cheese out of a factory for his friends, and goes past through their goofy guard cat, Sylvester. There are also a lot of great cartoons here, especially highlighted on the newest volume 5 which includes classics from the great director Bob Clampett like The Old Grey Hare, and The Daffy Doc, where Daffy fakes being a doctor to a well Porky and tries to operate on him in the looniest way possible.

There are also a lot of extras here including commentary from people who worked in these wonderful cartoons like June Foray, who played Granny, Tweety's guardian and the overlooked villainess, Witch Hazel, and behind the toons which takes a look at the characters from Pepe Le Pew and Elmer Fudd, which work very well, and classic TV Specials that were dedicated to Warner Brothers cartoon legends like the 1990 clebration Happy Birthday Bugs: 50 Looney Years; which featured special dedications from Whoopi Goldberg, Dr. Ruth and the late and definitively great voiceover Mel Blanc, as well as other TV Specials like Bugs Bunny's Bustin' Out All Over on the new Volume 5.

Still, with a price of nearly $300, Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volumes 1-5 doesn't completely add up in value to newcomers of the Looney Tunes classics, unless you are a definitive die hard fan. Still, it does have a lot of classic cartoons that are still sure to make anybody laugh their heads off, and that still is all folks!

2910130,1,B000TSTENC,"The contents of the individual Golden Collection sets that are gathered together here range from ""stupendous"" down to ""pretty good"".  Unfortunately, Amazon keeps changing the price, and for the majority of the time it doesn't make any sense at all to buy this 5 set collection.  As of July 9, 2008 it costs about $100 more than the 4 set collection.  Why on earth would anyone would pay $100 for set 5, which has an MSRP $35 LESS????  What is Amazon thinking?  If it ever drops down to $190 or less again by all means snap it right up, but most of the time this isn't worth it.",1191801600,4,577,4.305555555555555
2910131,2,B000TSTENC,"We go through this every year when a new Golden Collection comes out. The pricing of this set was originally set sixty dollars higher than if you bought Looney Tunes: Golden Collection, Vol. 1-4 together and then preordered Volume 5 separately, which is what I suggest if you don't have any of the Golden Collections and want to start from scratch until the price comes down. As for the collections themselves, they are all outstanding. The only negative thing I can say is that characters and styles of cartoons tend to be grouped together on a disc, so you may get tired of watching an entire disc of Tweety in one sitting, for example.

This year's release, Volume 5, will include:
1. A disc dedicated to Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, with a few cartoons in which they appear together.
2. A disc dedicated to fairy tales. This disc will include a couple of Tex Avery's. Some cartoons will have the familiar Looney Tunes characters, and some will not.
3. A disc dedicated to the work of Bob Clampett. Clampett's irreverant and outrageous style is what helped Warner Bros. animation step out of the shadow of Disney's style into its own unique territory.
4. Disc four is entitled ""Early Daze"" and has some early cartoons and miscellaneous classics on it.

Special features include a documentary on Chuck Jones made in 2000, commentaries, TV specials, and segments from ""The Bugs Bunny Show"". Note that my two star rating will not hold and should turn to five stars if the collection ever equals or betters the individually sets sold separately.",1189036800,29,1542,4.75
2910132,5,B000TSTENC,"Hey... Just want to say ""Thanks so much"" for the Golden Collection of Looney Tunes (Volumes 1-5). I received my dvds quickly and in good condition. I could not find them at a better price on the outside... not even at the wholesale clubs. We're still on volume one, so we have many more cartoons to enjoy. Thanks again. SHAWN",1254787200,2,325,4.433333333333334
2910133,5,B000TSTENC,"I watched this site on and off for about 3 months; eventually I was able to get my new set at a very affordable price.  So glad I got mine!  I do think this is the best collection you'll find while it's still available.  It's so huge, I can spend one Saturday afternoon with just one CD (there are 20 all together). I'm able to relish and have a few good laughs to brighten the end of the week. I'll be watching these for some time to come - they get crazier and funnier as you go.

What's so fun about Looney Tunes?  Perhaps you could start with the creators, who give a few interviews at the end of each CD, talking about how much fun they had developing the characters and story lines.  The great musical compositions can be mesmerizing; the funny side-effect sounds, the zany pals and foes who are always getting themselves into and out of trouble - everyone is either being chased because someone is hungry, or outwitting the bully or taking some mean beatings-up, often self-inflicted!  A little like real life?! The story lines are often ironic, perplexing and cynical. Throw in some elements of fairy tale... All the things kids deal with!  Maybe that's why these cartoons are classics - they help us keep a sense of humor.

Beautifully colored animations and backgrounds enhance the life-like ""personalities"", making characters like Tweety, Sylvester, Granny, Daffy, Yosemete Sam, Coyote & Roadrunner, Foghorn Leghorn and Bugs unforgettable.  For all children at heart!  You will want these sets to keep and share forever.",1244246400,,1531,4.739622641509434
2910134,4,B000TSTENC,"Very entertaining, but the 'themes' tend to cause the children to lose interest. Part of the joy of the original 'toons' was the randomness of the episodes. 4.5 to 5 stars if it were presented more in chronological order, or just random order. That's all folks!",1243468800,,261,4.695652173913044

2910136,5,B000TSTENC,"So I didn't purchase this collection from Amazon. I actually bought it from ebay for 129.00 then they had 10% off and so it was 119 with free shipping! I must say it has been the best investment I've made all year long!!!!! I mean wow. My husband came home the other day and found me giggling like a gleeful child on the floor in front of the TV. Absolutely some of the best television ever! In total I believe it's about 300 hours of lovely cartoon classic bliss.

In short, the bargains are out there. Just do your homework and shop around and believe me, it's so worth it!",1227398400,,575,4.2272727272727275

2910138,5,B000TSTENC,These DVD's are a treasure trove of excellence in the glory days of animation. I am so thankful the Warner Bros. boys decided to put these out and Praise God they are not censored. I literally laughed until I cried watching these exquisite classics. I loved them as a kid watching them afterschool and on Saturday mornings and I consider them a national treasure. I pray that there will be even more in the future.,1219449600,,414,4.533333333333333
2910139,5,B000TSTENC,"I'm 18 and I love all of the old looney toons shows that I used to watch.  It was the first thing I turned to when I watched tv.

2910141,5,B000TSTENC,First of all I'm not reviewing about the price of these and I'm not going into great detail about each volume. Anyone looking up Looney Tunes or anything associated with the franchise should be a fan and I'm sure each of you have seen these cartoons enough for me not to go into detail. Sure they're a little expensive but think about it what series on DVD isn't?,1205884800,,363,4.352941176470588

I do have so that I never realized how much Bugs Bunny ran around in drag before I watched these again....hmmmm....",1267056000,,447,4.55
