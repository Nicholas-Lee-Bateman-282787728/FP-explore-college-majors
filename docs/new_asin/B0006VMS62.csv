ROSA PARKS: MODERN DAY HEROINE is the first in a new line of releases titled, ""Golden Classics."" These will feature a number of restoration packages of many of Ray's personal films over the past 40 years, and will be a new line of releases to be seen over the next two years. The award-winning U.S. Navy documentary WEST AFRICA: A CNO SPECIAL (1981) hosted by Alex Haley is planned as the next Golden Classics release.

But back to ROSA PARKS. Ray adapted this DVD, from a filmstrip he produced 30 years ago, which is now seen as the first documentary ever done on this subject. With the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement approaching next year, he felt it was his duty to be involved with its restoration.

The DVD starts off with Ray sitting before the camera and telling us about this project, and his own involvement. He speaks quite passionately and you tell how much joy and pride he takes in his work.

The documentary starts off with the narrator asking the question, ""What is Heroism?"" We are then shown a number of historical individuals, both black and white, that made their marks in history. The final person mentioned is Rosa Parks and we are ready to hear her own story.

We are given a history of Rosa and the events that led up to her refusing to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus to a white male passenger in December of 1955. This led to the involvement of the Civil Rights leaders Martin Luther King and Ralph Abernathy and the famous Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rosa's voice gives us some of the narration of the events and is supplemented by the wonderfully stirring musical score by Michael Gonzales. I can't say enough glowing things about the superlative production on this wonderful documentary.

Included with the DVD is a ""Study Guide"" that teacher's can use with their students, after they have viewed the documentary.
