6936424,5,B00RY3N7S8,nash bridges season 4 a great tv show from amazon,1425686400,,49,4.0
6936425,3,B00RY3N7S8,"great show, so happy to have it on disc finally! the only reasons i gave it a 3 is because there are no subtitles, no 'play all' function, each episode is 1 long chapter and the picture is quite grainy, almost blurry at times (not faulty discs, just not a great transfer). however, aside from those few minor issues it's a great set and had no problem enjoying each episode for what they are. i wish paramount would have released all the seasons instead of VEI, but i will take what i can.",1424995200,3,489,4.268817204301075
6936426,5,B00RY3N7S8,Please offer season 5 & 6 as you offered season 4- I'm ready to buy!,1424390400,,68,3.6
6936427,5,B00RY3N7S8,How wonderful to finally get season 4 of Nash Bridges.  The DVDs played perfectly.  I hope the final two seasons are released in a timely fashion.,1423872000,,146,4.576923076923077
6936428,1,B00RY3N7S8,Every disc has a defect in it. The next to last episode will not play in order from the menu. I had to go to the last episode and back up into the previous episode. This worked on two of the disc's but the last disc the next to last episode would not play at all. It froze the disc and I had to turn my player off and back on again. And to make makes worse the episode that would not play is the first of a two part episode. I have never had this kind of problem with a DVD before and I buy 100's of DVD's. It is obviously a manufacturing defect. When you buy as many DVD's as I do you expect to have a problem now and then but it is still frustrating. I would chalk it up to just a bad disc if it did not happen on every disc the exact same way.,1423699200,7,746,3.66875
6936429,5,B00RY3N7S8,I have a weakness for Don Johnson. Don't judge me! I'm SO happy that more seasons of this show are being made available on DVD. Now I don't need to look like I'm stuck in 1993 by saving my old VHS tapes.,1423008000,3,203,3.857142857142857

6936439,4,B00RY3N7S8,"Good stuff, season 4 is very entertaining  with a bit of drama thrown in. Yasmine Bleeth is terrific and a welcome addition
to the series. Her confrontations with Nash are a hoot to say the least. Also Joe, Evan, Harvey, Cassidy, Nick and Rick
make for a good supporting cast. . The San Francisco setting also adds good views to one of the most beautiful
cities in the world. Don Johnson is one terrific actor not only in this series but also Miami Vice, His cameo role
in the movie Django Unchained was priceless.  that's a wrap ""Bubba.""  ROCKIN RON.",1437782400,,551,4.49

6936445,4,B00RY3N7S8,"This collection has all the old shows with good clear picture quality and decent sound.  It has none of the little extras that Paramount put into their Season 1-3 discs.  This season also lacks subtitles.  Still, it beats buying the Japanese versions for $300.00 per season.",1433894400,,274,4.913043478260869
6936446,5,B00RY3N7S8,Waited a long time for the other seasons. Happy with the purchase.,1433462400,,66,4.583333333333333

6936450,5,B00RY3N7S8,"I just wish they would break the remainder of the series a part.  Why put out the first three out individually and then packed the remainder in a package.  Season five you can only get in Japanese or some such mess.  If I hadn't had the first three seasons already, I would gladly bought the package, but this is ridiculous at this late date.",1431043200,2,342,4.3125

6936452,5,B00RY3N7S8,"I enjoyed watching Nash Bridges-Season 4 every bit as much as I liked watching Seasons 1, 2 and 3.  I wish Don Johnson and Cheech Marin

were still making Nash Bridges.  It was a terrific tv series.  I can't wait to get Season 5 and 6.  If you really want something good to watch, I

would recommend this series 100%.",1428969600,,317,4.2

8696271,4,B00RY3N7S8,"The episodes are great. The last episode of season four, about 24 minutes through, freezes and is unwatchable. The part right when Nash and Cage are fighting the group of martial artists in the gym. How irritating.",1470355200,,214,4.8108108108108105

8696276,4,B00RY3N7S8,The actress portraying Nash's daughter (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) is sickening and a real pain in the tush.  Cheech Marin and Don Johnson's playing off each other is entertaining.  I can understand why it didn't go beyond five seasons.,1449705600,,227,4.947368421052632
