In 1937, Grierson left the GPO [later known as the Crown Film Unit] and Cavalcanti took charge with the production of the seminal NORTH SEA.

To expand a bit more on that bare description:  GRANTON TRAWLER, co-directed by John Grierson and Edgar Anstey in 1934, follows a fishing trawler from her home base in Scotland's Granton Harbour up to the fishing grounds between Shetland and Norway.  This particular boat was later sunk in a 1941 German bombing raid.  PETT AND POTT: A FAIRY STORY OF THE SUBURBS is a 1934 satire directed by Cavalcanti.  NORTH SEA, directed by Harry Watt in 1938, is the tale of another fishing trawler.  This time the drama is provided by a dangerous storm, and the film praises both the brave fishermen and the government coastal-radio services which help to keep them from harm.
