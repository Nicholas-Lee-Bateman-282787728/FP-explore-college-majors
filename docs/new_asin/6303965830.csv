7858099,5,6303965830,"This tape is really about the end of two of Scotland's finest military organizations - Highlanders and Queens Own Highlanders.  The video provides a well done documentary regarding the history of those, some great footage from the memorial, and then also of the final parading of their colors in 1994 with HRH Prince Charles in attendance.  I found my copy via on of Amazon's associates and for the price thought I got a steal!",1041724800,3,427,4.756756756756757
7858100,5,6303965830,"The title of this video is a bit deceiving.  This is the farewell concert in 1994 of the regimental bands of the Gordon Highlanders and Queens Own Highlanders.  Under Options for Change all regimental bands in the British army were being augmented as larger divisional bands.  This resulted in the loss of many fine old bands which had existed with their regiments for several hundred years.  This video concerns the last concert that was given by the bands in Aberdeen, the regimental home of the Gordons.  As such it is a moving and sad salute.  The two bands on stage are also joined by the Drums and Pipes of the 1st battalion the Gordon Highlanders.  This 60 minute presentation provides some of the highlights of the concert.  The combined regimental bands provide a stirring program of concert music and regimental tunes. The emphasis is on the Gordons, the Queens Own seem to get little attention here. When both bands are joined by the drums and pipes some fine combined selections are played, as well as a spirited display by the regimental dancers of the ""Highland Fling"". This video is certainly worth having as it is a fitting salute to the end of the Gordons.  Not long afterwards both the Gordons and Queens Own Highlanders were combined into the The Highlanders (Seaforths, Camerons and Gordons)  It is in this truncated form that both regiments now live on as a remainder of their once great past.",977788800,16,1414,4.758196721311475
