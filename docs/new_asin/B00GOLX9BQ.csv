With Unmanned he has once again hit the target with incredible timing. A full on investigation into U.S. drone policy, Unmanned will absolutely open your eyes into the impact of drone strikes, and whether you are pro or con their use, this is a film you should see.",1398124800,2,431,4.917808219178082
6095683,5,B00GOLX9BQ,"This film is absolutely essential!. Drone warfare is a nightmarish technology- a 21st century method of lynching. Like a lynch mob, drone murder is  anonymous and cowardly with the drone operator 10,000 miles away; they both presume the guilt of their victims; and they both take place within the context of the racist dehumanization of an entire people. Shame on Obama for embracing Bush's oil driven racist war on terror- a truly insane formula for never-ending war where the only winners are the companies that manufacture the weapons. This film opens a door to this horror that is being conducted in our name- it should be seen by all of us.",1430438400,2,645,4.8108108108108105

6095687,5,B00GOLX9BQ,"This is not an easy film to watch. But it is well worth watching.

You might say that every documentary should show both sides of the story in a balanced way, which this one fails to do. All you see are the stories of the children getting killed and injured, or community leaders in peaceful discussions being blown apart. The film doesn't show all the Taliban and terrorists who have been killed by drones - where are they?

The point, surely, is that it doesn't matter how many bad guys have been killed. How many innocents does it take before you begin to call it murder? How many unjustified attacks can a peaceful, long-suffering people absorb before hatred takes hold, and an entire people begins to regard the US as a cowardly and cruel source of evil and death?

Killing innocent people is murder. The ""other side of the story"" is irrelevant. There is no way to create a ""balanced"" report on cold blooded indiscriminate murder.

This film has made me think of President Obama in a completely different way: not as a champion of democracy but as a serial killer. And that isn't a good thing.",1422230400,,1098,4.558375634517766

6095689,3,B00GOLX9BQ,"While traumatic to be sure, this show doesn't (and can't because of National Security issues) give all sides. Only those that are given by the operator and ""witnesses"" on the ground. If this was a bad shoot then heads should roll! I personally believe there should be some on the oversight committee that have actually been in combat. However, I do agree that with this kind of technology, There will be opportunity for abuse. Does that mean don't use it? Maybe hesitate a little and a good guy dies? This is just one more dilemma of WAR. I am grateful for those people who serve, and I pray that they are protected. Other wise a good show, Because it forces those questions to be thought and talked about. I gave it 3 stars because of it not quite being balanced. (lean to liberal).",1405555200,,783,4.4825174825174825

6095691,5,B00GOLX9BQ,Highly recommended.  One of Greenwald's best.  Film covers many of the issues related to drones in an economical 63 minutes.  Greenwald has done a great service in bringing out this film.,1398643200,3,187,4.967741935483871
8625611,5,B00GOLX9BQ,"Absolutely Brilliant and Powerfully Illuminating Documentary long over due on the reality of ""our"" war against terrorism. The real terrorism of the slaughter of innocent people by drones told by a drone pilot along with extensive research on the truth behind the propaganda which is making us less safe and more immoral.",1521244800,,320,5.173076923076923
8625612,4,B00GOLX9BQ,"This documentary shows the horrendous end results of erroneous drone bombings.  See kids, grandparents, parents, etc. get drone
bombed for no good reason.  These military drone planes are created by U.S. companies like Boeing, Raytheon, etc.
Read comments about politicians under the Obama administration taking credit for taking out teen soccer players and grandparents who
they claim were terrorists.  Hear about people's anxiety about leaving their homes in Pakistan.  Listen to a drone bomb operator voice his
remorse and express how a military chaplain told him it was okay.  We as a nation are having our security put at risk by high ranking military
puppet masters such as Leon and his cohorts.",1508198400,,701,5.223214285714286

8625614,5,B00GOLX9BQ,"From Robert Greenwald, the documentary director that gave us films like OUTFOXED, UNCONSTITUTIONAL: THE WAR ON OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES, UNCOVERED: THE WAR ON IRAQ, and WAR ON WHISTLEBLOWERS comes another fairly short but nevertheless devastating documentary about how endangered America is by what our government does, allegedly in our name but totally ignoring the value of human lifer we hold dear.  That film is UNMANNED: AMERICAS DRONE WARS.

Given that thousands of American troops and millions of innocent civilians have had to pay the ultimate price for an out-of-control American foreign policy in Afghanistan and Iraq, a new kind of warfare has emerged in recent years, that of drone warfare, instigated by unmanned drones controlled by pilots in isolated bunkers thousands of miles away from the battlefield itself.  Developed by the Bush Administration in the so-called War On Terror, and accelerated under the Obama Administration, such warfare was supposed to reduce the so-called collateral damage and unintended side effects of actual person-to-person combat.  But as Greenwald found out, interviewing one pilot who controlled several drone strikes, the victims of such drone strikes in Afghanistan and Iraq, and U.S. military veterans like Andrew Bacevich and Lawrence Wilkerson (the latter the former press spokesman to Colin Powell), the U.S. drone program has had some incredible problems in minimizing such damage; and in fact, instead of helping us win the War On Terror, it may in fact be radicalizing the very people in those areas of the world where the strikes are being carried outthe very people who we are supposedly saving, but in fact could turn out to be the next jihadists, whether they go into whats left of Al-Qaeda, ISIS, or whatever future extremist Islamic terrorist group that comes in the future.

Exactly how are we protecting ourselves from another 9/11, or incidents like the attacks in Paris, Brussels, or San Bernardino if, by killing with imprecise technology launched from an isolated bunker, combined with imprecise intelligence, we end up killing ten or twenty innocent civilians just to get a mere handful of jihadists?  How is that protecting either the national security or, more importantly, the people of the United States?

UNMANNED, like the more recent fictional feature film EYE IN THE SKY, probes that conundrum in detail, and the results of our drone strikes are not made to be pleasant to watch, even as they resemble video games.  This movie forces us to think of the blowback and the unintended consequences that could come our way in the future.  We are ill-served by our leaders who make decisions without having thought such things through, and that is what the essential nexus of UNMANNED is really about.",1461974400,,2767,5.186098654708521

8625616,5,B00GOLX9BQ,"Keep watching the skies?  The documentary RISE OF THE DRONES is a good companion to this one, making you wish drones were still just some science-fiction like in THE TERMINATOR movies.  Now drones are both on your Christmas List and your Sh*t List. Drones are one of those mixed blessings.  I love the episode of HARRY'S LAW where the hero lawyer shotguns down a drone over her home. What fun!  Another video game!  Even the Military has high-power laser weapons designed to shoot down incoming drones.  Can you even imagine a 100,000 watt laser?!  Recall that your little green pointer is supposed to be less than about 0.005 watt to protect eyes.  Now our government thinks its own drones are above background checks, just like personal guns.  Just wait for your own little drone to come in the mail, file that FAA paperwork to register it, and momentarily think of all the foreign deaths big drones cause.

8625617,5,B00GOLX9BQ,A must see for every American who plans to vote. We are morally responsible to know how the US government is conducting war. Drone warfare is preemptive warfare and tge IS Congress has never discussed the issue.,1448409600,,211,4.72972972972973
