8132012,4,B000GGSMBC,"After three DVDs of mainly fillers, I was more than ready for an actual plot to start developing. (As much as I love fillers, Reload's did not all capture my attention as the first Saiyuki series' did.) DVD 4 of Saiyuki Reload doesn't quite get into the real plot of series, but it does get a little more serious.

The first episode is a cute filler that deals with Hakuryu, the white dragon, and a group of little kids who want to keep him as a pet.

In the second and third episodes, Dr. Ni gives Kougaiji a forbidden bracelet that would enhance the power of its user. More determined than ever, Kougaiji seeks out the Sanzo party to defeat them once and for all. The plot of these two episodes is very similar to the three-parter on DVD 5 of Saiyuki, ""Sting of the Scorpion."" Sanzo has been poisoned, and Kougaiji wants to attack. Goku, Gojyo, and Hakkai all fight back, but when Kougaiji gets cornered, he puts on the bracelet and becomes nearly invincible. It's interesting to see how in the original series, Goku was the one resorting to drastic measures to beat Kougaiji, while in these episodes, Kougaiji is the one using forbidden powers to win.

However, when all hope seems lost, Kougaiji's bracelet starts to weaken him suddenly, and Goku and the others manage to break it and knock him out. Dokugakuji appears on the scene and collects Kougaiji. When he gets him back to the castle, however, Ni explains that Yaone is out at the moment, and that the only ones available to take care of Kougaiji are the doctors. With no other option, Doku hands him over.

The last episode on the disc covers two stories: one is Goku reminiscing about the snow, and the first time he'd walked out into it, and the other deals with Yaone and Dokugakuji, who are fighting their way through the guards at the castle to reach Kougaiji, whom the doctors are all experimenting on.

All in all, the disc was pretty good. Not as exciting as the first fight in the desert, but still pretty enjoyable. Kougaiji's group probably won't be seen again until the next series, and the next DVD looks to start the main plot of the remainder of the series.",1126137600,3,2134,4.518134715025907
