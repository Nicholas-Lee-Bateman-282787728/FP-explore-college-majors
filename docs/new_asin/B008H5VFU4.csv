5162221,3,B008H5VFU4,"This film was made from one of Henning Mankell's truly abysmal novels. It was not well-written. The film, on the other hand, takes some liberties, lops off some-frankly, worthless-excursions of Mankells, and delivers an OK result. The European sequences are good, and set up a good potential struggle that goes unrealized, based on a set-piece that happens at the very beginning, unfortunately. That sequence is good enough that it was probably the hook that got the film made at all. At any rate, the personality clash that comes up in the beginning isn't explored; one of the characters goes on to investigate the murders alone, and she solves it. If you see it, don't expect much, but trust me-the book is even worse. Note: I don't dislike Henning Mankell's work. It's just this book/film that I find less than satisfactory.",1357171200,3,827,4.914285714285715
5162222,4,B008H5VFU4,This is a well crafted thriller. The real life presentation of the leading characters is refreshing. The story is rich and believable even though the conceptual story is so fantastic.,1354924800,,183,5.133333333333334
5162223,4,B008H5VFU4,"Although I knew about the Chinese working on the construction of our early railways, I never considered what their life was like. It was an eye opener and motivatived me into a research of this part of our history.",1354665600,4,214,4.512820512820513
5162224,5,B008H5VFU4,"It is an excellent movie that will help you reflect on one of the current world issues - revenge based on historical injustice.  It is masterfully centered around great abuses that ocurred to the Chinese immigrants who came to America in the 1800s, but the revenge for the abuses are being carried out now.  The movie involves the last member of a Swedish family, the only member to have accidentally survived the revenge of a Chinese man who is well trained with the sword.  Both social realities for how to see historical abuse are represented in the story.  It is a drama that is driven along with a tension of suspense, a suspense driven by when is she going to get it.  There are many questions a viewer will take from this thought provoker.  A question that I took away from the story is how independent should my family loyalty be in light of a government's design to have all people individualized into the government's mode of behavior as defined by the terms ""an obedient citizen"".

Women who enjoy watching women control the power position in social dynamics will be satisfied with this movie.  All the positions of power are controlled by women except one but that male is nixed out by a woman of authority.  Interesting.
I found it an engaging dynamic that seemed pretty realistic except for one aspect that was missing.  The one aspect that was missing was the equally prone tendency of corruption that goes along with positions of power.  Women are as vulnerable as men, this is also where both sexes are equal.

I got more than I paid for.  Watch it and expect to have your mind expanded while entertained.",1350345600,17,1622,4.629370629370629
5162225,3,B008H5VFU4,"If you have NOTHING better to do for three hours, you might
like this.  To cut a long story short, it's about flashbacks to
when Chinese help built the railroad and had a brutal white
boss, who raped and killed a Chinese wife.

Then the young boy's ancestors demanded revenge, to save face and honor. They hire a hit man who kills the ancestors of the white guy and it goes on and on.  FF to halfway.....

The main player is a Swedish female judge
who is the only remaining descendant of the white guy and
she goes to China to find the killer.  It's long.  I'm sure
this is a re-release and this is an OLD picture made in the 90's.

It's sad what America did to the Chinese to get the railroad
built and we owe them penance for their forced service.",1349481600,3,749,4.159722222222222
5162226,5,B008H5VFU4,The plot was interesting and not obvious.  Acting and filming was well done.  I liked that it had a strong female as the main character.  The extent of the final concept of revenge was a bit far fetched but I still thought it worked for an intriguing story.  I would recommend it to people who enjoy any of the Scandinavian mysteries such as Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.,1393286400,,370,4.397058823529412

5162236,2,B008H5VFU4,"this was a very disappointing movie.  the premise is interesting but so many cliche tropes took any resemblance of drama away from it.  it tries too hard to capture the elements of a specific culture, specific history and notions of revenge that have been done many times already.  even the characterizations of divorce, police, corruption, family fealty, and the moral/ethical dilemmas of justice were just so basic and cliche.  i will forgive the subtitled translation as playing a larger role in why certain foreign concepts don't translate well to English language as well as blaming my own cultural experiences to judging this to be cliche.  for an American audience, i give this 2 stars.",1383091200,,693,5.043859649122807

So many changes from the book - I barely recognized it. Token scene in Africa, but never followed up, which was a major plot point of the book. And a husband? Maybe it's just been a while since I read the book, but I don't remember the main character having a husband. And why is he even here? In the end, he's pointless. And why is a Swedish judge running around ""Beijing"" in a house dress that looks like something my grandmother might have worn 30 years ago?

5162240,5,B008H5VFU4,"I was hooked in the first five minutes!

The story line creates a classic mystery in the form of a who-done-it.  As the plot unfolds the blending of modern and historical events weave together in a constantly twisting, dramatic fashion leading to an anti-climatic, yet appropriate, end.

Peter Keglevic, the Director, does an excellent job of addressing several modern and cultural issues.  Keglevic effectively shows multiple points of view on the death penalty, family dysfunction, ethnic bigotry, and cultural clash.

The characters are believable.  The soundtrack ebbs, flows, and peaks to create an emotional bond with the story and the characters that keeps the suspense alive.  The cinematography draws the viewer into the story making the film an enjoyable experience.",1377388800,,776,5.416666666666667

I've watched Part 1 of 2, which is mostly in Sweden.
It was a decently done murder/mystery, and the ending left you in mid-air.
I'd give it 3.5; but we can't do half stars.
So I'll watch the 2nd part tonight and update this after.

Ok, the 2nd part... takes place supposedly in Guangzhou (Canton), with back-flashes to the US west, and some scenes back in Sweden.

5162250,4,B008H5VFU4,"A good movie to watch with international intrigue based on avarice and revenge.  It shows the dangers of taking family tragedy generated hate beyond the point of reason.  This movie is set on the international stage and does show some, but not much, Chinese government involvement mostly in the form of tacit approval of the actions of one of its private citizens.  An unusual feature of this movie is a mature female protagonist.  I enjoyed this movie.

This is a two part movie with both parts coming on the same download or streaming.  The two parts may have made sense for the dramatic release but do not for a video to be seen at home.

There is some actual violence in the movie and a lot of implied violence and death.  The base subject matter of the evils of prejudice and hatred are subjects that should taught to all age groups but I think this movie would be too much for younger viewers to absorb and understand and would not recommend it for those younger than late teens.",1371340800,,985,4.49438202247191
5162251,1,B008H5VFU4,"A waste of time. The story has promise, but the movie sucks. Acting is poor, Swedish speaking chinese with dubbed voices is awkward, and it is much too long. More like a student film with a budget.",1370995200,2,197,4.351351351351352

I'm a huge fan of foreign films but this one is a complete bust! The pace was bad, plot not believable and the acting was way below par. Not to mention there's going to be more in the future. I was so angry with the stupid ending that I couldn't help but to vent my frustration on Amazon.

Yes, the movie was free with Amazon Prime but PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AS I HAVE. They should remove this movie from Amazon completely and burn the original.",1370476800,4,634,3.984251968503937
5162254,1,B008H5VFU4,"I just finished watching this movie. I had started reading the book and thought I would skip ahead, so to speak, by watching the movie. The book is well written, but this movie, what a mess. The woman who plays the judge in search of a killer has got to be the stupidest person on the planet. I finally began to wish the killer would just finish her off. She kept stumbling in and out of trouble so often it just became ridiculous. Only the killer was more inept. How he managed to kill all those other people in the first place is a mystery. Don't waste your time with this movie.",1370476800,7,581,4.196428571428571
5162255,2,B008H5VFU4,"After watching the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy, which was excellent, I was looking forward to a film with similar qualities. I regret that this film failed on all counts. Although the concept for the plot was good, the script, the acting and almost every aspect of the film failed to meet my expectations. I gave the film two stars and that was being generous.

If all of the judges in Sweden have the same lack of common sense and intelligence as shown by the main character, the country is in serious trouble. The plot failed to meet the ""it could happen"" test in this regard. The lead police detective character has the same problem. If she is an example of the average Swedish detective, God help the victims of crime in Sweden. A judge that finds themselves in a situation where the lead detective treats the only surviving family member of a massacre in that way would be on the phone to any number of political and judicial connections to get the situation under control. The detective would have been removed from the case so fast as to make her head spin.

Any person who is intelligent enough to become a judge should have the common sense to have a couple of bodyguards assigned to her instead of bumbling around and making herself an easy target for the killer. I realize that human frailty is a key ingredient in adding tension to the plot of a ""thriller"", but the way it was used in this film was ridiculous. It's on a level with those films where the character is running away from a killer but keeps falling down and tripping just to make sure the killer catches up. I won't even address the idea of the judge flying off to China to try and track down the killer herself. At least she called her soon to be ex-husband, a train conductor. All he needed to do to help her was to turn his train around and get the porters to form up a posse.",1369872000,5,1862,4.378612716763006
5162256,1,B008H5VFU4,"Directed by Peter Keglevic, whose greatest claim to fame was a comedy about magic drumsticks 25 years ago.  Competent actors wasted on an absurd script; the wonderful Michael Nyquist is thrown away in practically a bit part.  Main lead Suzanne Von Brosody does her best but can't overcome the ridiculous plot in which Swedish police are colossal idiots, everyone speaks German, even in Nevada, Sweden and China, and the main character impulsively chases a Chinese mass murderer to China with no plan or resources.  Amy Cheng, as the sister of a sociopathic corrupt Chinese businessman, is compelling but ultimately she's undone by the mindless plot as well.  Almost everybody dies, but not soon enough.  Decent production values, but who cares?  The whole thing is a mess, except for some intercut flashbacks of 1800s America, which are gruesome and over the top, but at least the story is compelling.  The first half starts out well, but the whole thing is ultimately hopelessly disappointing, if you value logic in any quantity.",1367193600,6,1030,5.059171597633136

It moves from Sweden to China in this century and to the US in the 19th century.  I felt more atmosphere in Sweden but there is more action in China. Credibility gets stretched thin at times.  This is partly corrected by the actress who plays the lead who makes her character convincing most of the time. The Chinese actors were less convincing.

The direction is more like ""directionless.""; I had to wonder if the director was sending up the mystery genre? Or just incompetent? Threads of plot disappear into nowhere, the setting flips between locales and eras with poor links, and several plausible twists and/or resolutions are studiously avoided in favor of some vague revenge motive, further complicated with a criminal mastermind sub-plot that is introduced and then never developed or connected to the main scenario.

I must say this is one of the most disturbing movie, I have ever saw. I need to psychoanalyst the Swedish mind. I thought swedish people are pretty balanced people. I don't know who is more disturbed, the people who made this movie or the reviewers who liked this movie.

Instead of writing a review myself. Let me just quote from another reviewer from IMDB.

""This film is made up of spare parts, but it's still an improvement on the book. It appears that, in turning a book into a movie, it is possible to substitute good acting and production values for sloppy writing. The first 20-odd pages of the book were well-done, and that is replicated in the film. The first 30 minutes or so show a horrific murder scene, and introduce two good, well-acted female characters clashing over the investigation. Near the end of that sequence, the Chinese connection is made, and all credibility goes out the window. The evidence of a Chinese connection is frail & tenuous, but, OK, the scene shifts to Beijing, where we meet a comic-book Chinese villain who is, of course, ruthless, wealthy & powerful for no apparent reason. Actually, ""ruthless"" can be explained-for the story's purposes-by a violent, xenophobic assault suffered by his father when he was laying track for American railways in the 1860s. This wealthy & powerful guy is maybe 40-45 years old? You do the math. Fortunately,the filmmaker,who is Austrian, opted to omit the book's section set in Africa, which contained some real howlers, and he chooses to end it with the central figure, a Swedish judge, arriving safely back in Stockholm. One peculiarity of this film that can't be blamed on the book's author is the treatment of language. For the US print, of course, the subtitles are in English, but in spite of the settings, i.e., Sweden, China, and very briefly the US, every character on screen speaks German. The Chinese characters are dubbed in German, the lone American character actually speaks good German, and all the Swedes speak serviceable German. Maybe it was made for Austrian TV. Whatever the reason, it was jarring to see Chinese characters, in a subtitled film, delivering lines in German. Another good reason to avoid the scenes set in Africa.""",1360454400,3,2348,4.8675

8527950,5,B008H5VFU4,Great mystery story by Henning Mankell. IMO  Henning Mankell is a fabulous mystery writer who also investigated cultural issues.,1471305600,,128,5.7368421052631575

8527952,5,B008H5VFU4,"When most books are adapted for the movies they are not very good.  But in the case of any Mankell works the movies are better.  Why?
Because they cut out the excess and all the red herrings Mankell slips into his works.  He will cheat at the end and say ""Nobody ever figured out why such and such happened""  That cheating but the books are so good and so far the movie versions are even better.  Same for the Kenneth Branagh WALLANDER episodes.  This one is no exception.  All the nonsense about colonizing Africa and other things that bogged down the book are gone and we still have a long movie but quite good.  Nice to see Michael Bloomquist again and he is great. So Mr Mankell, keep writing great books and let the movie people make it better.",1441238400,,749,4.338129496402877

8527954,4,B008H5VFU4,Great show; however it didn't follow the book too closely.  I thought the acting was superb and the cinematography was very good.,1425945600,,129,4.863636363636363
8527955,3,B008H5VFU4,"Subtitled and in German, not Swedish, as Mankell the author. I have seen another version I thought was better. Female lead character appears to be rather nieve towards the end. Rather frustrating to watch here get into situations you know she can't handle. 3 hours long.",1415836800,,270,4.891304347826087
8527956,1,B008H5VFU4,"All mysteries become improbable at some point.  Some push it and try your patience.  This one is so ridiculous, so insultingly stupid that I still can't believe it got made.",1401062400,,173,4.733333333333333
8527957,4,B008H5VFU4,Very good movie with great people cast in the roles they played thought provoking and realistic shows you why letting go is important !!!,1393804800,,137,4.75
8527958,5,B008H5VFU4,"The show consists of two back-to-back TV movies based on a book by Henning Mankell  (best known from ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""). The soundtrack language is German and subtitles are in English. As a native German speaker I found the combination very easy to comprehend, just listen and do the occasional read. But the subtitles are very good all by themselves. The only thing that seemed a little strange to me was the way Swedish and Chinese actors came out with this flawless Gernan enunciation.

Anyhow, I prefer not to give away too much if the plot. It involves a batch of grisly murders in a Swedish backwoods hamlet, hometown of a female judge, whose estranged parents are among the victims. Her efforts to unravel the mystery diverge from the easy local solution proposed by the various  police organizations that get involved. Bit by bit, she us able to collect evidence of a long-standing feud, stretching back more than a century to building of the transcontinental railroad in the American West, that ties together a Chinese organization and one of her ancestral relatives. In the second movie, the action shifts from what is depicted as largely rural Sweden to a dramatically modern China and leads to an eventual resolution of the mysteries. Highly recommended to watch in a single session.",1393459200,,1311,4.896396396396397
