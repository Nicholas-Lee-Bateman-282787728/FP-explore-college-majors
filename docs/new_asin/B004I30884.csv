4382894,5,B004I30884,"Darlene Love: Concert of Love. A live concert DVD by one of America's greatest, under-recognized, singers, finally, as of 2011, voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This is a sassy, spirited, spontaneous performance by Darlene Love, a woman whose voice has been heard on literally hundreds of hits, as she brings down the house with favorites never before seen in a live concert recording of her solo show.  She's surely no spring chicken these days, but I don't think her voice has lost a bit.

Music legend Phil Spector hand-picked Love as a singer himself, and suggested she take ""Love"" as a stage name: as, she says, she always mistrusted Spector, we now know with very good cause, she later legally changed her surname.  She was, in fact, born Darlene Wright, a preacher's daughter.

At any rate, Love is widely considered the voice that launched a hundred hits. During the 1960's mega girl-group era, she sang backup for artists like Sam Cooke, Elvis Presley Doris Day, Nat King Cole, Cher, Dionne Warwick, the Righteous Brothers, Tom Jones and many other great acts. On some of Spector's greatest hits, every voice on the supposedly Crystals' ""Da Doo Ron Ron"" was hers; as was every voice on any Bobby Sox and the Blue Jeans hit.  She played Maybelle Motormouth for three years in the Broadway production of ""Hairspray:"" (Queen Latifah took the part in the film.)  Love co-starred with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in all four of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lethal-Weapon-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00000G3PL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lethal Weapon: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;films. She also appeared in the last film made by Elvis Presley, in 1969,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Change-of-Habit/dp/B00006674X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Change of Habit</a>, with Mary Tyler Moore. Love has long been a favorite of TV personality David Letterman's; she has performed on his Late Night Christmas special since 1986.  Her music has been featured on over 22 movies soundtracks, but there has never been a live solo performance recorded until now.  Hallelujah!

Some of the songs on this DVD are:
Da Doo Ron Ron
He's Sure the Boy I Love
He's a Rebel
Today I Met the Boy I'm Gonna Marry
Wait Til My Bobby Gets Home
I Know Where I've Been (from ""Hairspray"")

She's a great, longtime favorite of mine, and I've managed to read her autobiography, long out of print, and hard to find, unfortunately:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Name-Is-Love-The-Darlene-Love-Story/dp/0688156576/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Name Is Love: The Darlene Love Story</a>.  I've also managed to see her several times.  At least twice at New York's late, lamented club, the Bottom Line (a site now absorbed into New York University), doing her Christmas show with Ronni Spector, another of Spector's great stars, and also a long-time favorite of mine.  At Central Park, in an open-air show with Nona Hendryx.  At that show, I found myself standing by the path that had been set aside for the artists to exit, surrounded by autograph hunters.  As she passed me by, she gave me a look that us New Yorkers would call, ""so nu, what are you doing standing here without an autograph book?""  Hey, I just wanted to breathe the same air as her for a second.  You can bet that this DVD gives me great pleasure.",1301356800,2,3425,5.407894736842105

4382917,5,B004I30884,"It's just fantastic to have available a live concert DVD of the legendary Darlene Love. Audio and video quality are very good. One might have wished for a longer set, but, as this is the only available Love concert, something is so much better than nothing. Darlene is in fine voice and is obviously enthusiastic and involved at this show. A broad range of diverse material from her back catalog is testament to her tremendous vocal prowess. Highlight is a smoking version of ""River Deep, Mountain High"" that demonstrates Phil Spector perhaps made a misjudgement in giving the song to Tina Turner for the original release. His choice made Tina's career. How different it would have been for Darlene's if her version had been chosen instead. An excellent show by an All American great. Indispensable for all lovers of American popular music. One last thought, where can one get hold of Darlene's performances on the David Letterman show? There's some great stuff there also.",1382227200,4,973,4.939024390243903
4382918,5,B004I30884,"I turn 70 in a few days. Plagued by unsteady gait, fatigue, decreased stamina, etc., the usual afflictions. The compensations, however, are that pretty girls generally walk a little slower, people, especially those near my age, either enjoy an easy going, oblique sense of humor, or they tolerate this old geezer.

The distinctive feature of this album is that the performance is brought to us by the ""backup"", ie the ""help"". The quality of this music attests to the ""headliners"", but is proven by Darlene Love and those others providing the headliner's musical platform.

Short term memory can be ""iffy"", but remote memory can often be a blessing. I think I can remember breakfast this morning, but Darlene Love's ""The Concert of Love"", has bought forward not only the beauty of this music, but also some of the fondest late night memories of this septuagenarian.",1375401600,,864,4.951724137931034
4382919,5,B004I30884,"I had never really known who she was. I had heard her music as a background singer and in other venues without really knowing.
I don't think she got the recognition that deserved. I hope this DVD will rectify that.",1362873600,,214,4.375
4382920,5,B004I30884,This concert DVD is totally fantastic !!  Darlene performs all of her biggest hits with such vitality and talent !!  This is one of my very favorite DVDs.  She has such an amazing voice and personality that this concert just flies by so fast.  I hope to see Darlene perform live someday.  One of the greatest musical talents of all-time !!  Magnificent !!,1360540800,,355,4.555555555555555

4382923,5,B004I30884,"Absolutely Brilliant. Well worth the money. There were so many brilliant US girl groups in the '60's', and this Lady was the source of my schoolboy fantasies, although I didn't know it. What a Superb voice. She doesn't sound any different, yet obviously she is older now. So many great songs, and no 'fillers'. This DVD is extremely well produced. The band are terrific and support Darlene really well, without overpowering her (who could 'overpower' that voice !!!). Only niggle for me is that there is no menu, so it's from start to finish or fast-forward to find particular songs. But, Hey, that's just a personal thing for me, and no way does it detract from the Total Quality of this DVD. My plain simple advice to everyone - BUY IT !!!!. Thanks to Amazon for your quick delivery.",1358899200,2,785,4.654676258992806

A great recorded concert that covers much of her entire Fifty plus year career. Favorite songs are Please Be Patient With Me,a A Fine Fine Boy, River Deep Mountain Gigh, He's A Rebel, and Christmas Baby Please Come Home. If you are a fan of Darlene Love,don't miss this ! Fans will love it. And you KNOW who you are.",1346198400,,418,4.172839506172839
4382925,5,B004I30884,"This is one of the most entertaining DVDs and with Darlene's magnificient voice, I often wonder why she was never the super-star, a title that she rightfully deserves. The quality of sound and video is at it's best and once you hear the first song, you can't walk away until the end of the concert. I remember her excerpts from the off-Broadway show ""Leader of the Pack"", which I would love to have on DVD, but don't know if it even exists.  Darlene is a winner in all that she does and has one of the best singing voices ever. She's paid her dues, now she needs the recognition she rightfully deserves.",1334275200,3,603,4.383928571428571
4382926,5,B004I30884,What a powerhouse of a voice like Shirley Bassey and Tina Turner.  I remember all of her hits from the old days.  They don't sing'em like that anymore.,1329091200,,151,4.357142857142857

4382928,5,B004I30884,"My daughter and I attended this concert at the Bergen PAC in Engelwood, NJ and it was such a joy to spend time with Darlene Love.  Her voice is as strong and beautiful as ever and I think this DVD should become a collecter's item for anyone who appreciates the great songs that came out of the 60's.  Darlene never received the credit she deserved for all the singing and backup singing she did on so many hit records.  Now, she's been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame - where she most definitely belongs.  My recommendation would be to do yourself a favor and buy this DVD - you will never regret doing so.",1307577600,,617,4.247863247863248
4382929,5,B004I30884,This is a wonderful concert.  The audience was blown away by her great voice.  Wish it was longer!!!,1305417600,,100,4.5
4382930,5,B004I30884,"I just recieved this DVD from Amazon. I first saw/heard of Darlene Love at a Murray The K show at the Brooklyn Fox theatre. She was performing with Bobby Sheen as Bob B. Soxx & The Blue Jeans. They sang their hit ""Zip A Dee Doo Dah"" on which Mr. Sheen sang lead, but Darlene ""yeah yeah yeahed"" at the end. Murray The K then came out and let the audience in on a big secret-Bob B. Soxx & The Blue Jeans were actually the group singing the current hit ""He's A Rebel"", not The Crystals. It was actually just Darlene, & she then sang it. Since then I've followed her career. I watched her as part of The Blossoms on Shindig, I've seen her at MSG backing up Elvis, at Westbury Music Fair backing up Dionne Warwick, I've her attended her Christmas concert, seen her on Letterman every year singing Christmas(Baby Please Come Home), I've seen her on Broadway in Leader Of The Pack, read her autobiography & bought all of her records.
  It's amazing to see her sing these songs that she recorded nearly 50 years ago & sound just like the records. Her backup band & singers did their best to try to recreate the ""wall of sound"". The audio & video quality is good. My only problem with the concert is that two of her big hits, Why Do Lover's Break Each Other's Hearts & Not Too Young To Get Married, both recorded as Bob B. Soxx & The Blue Jeans, were left off. It would have added another 6 minutes to the concert, but otherwise I highly recomend it.",1304640000,,1441,4.255474452554744
4382931,5,B004I30884,"Although she's nearing 70, Darlene Love's voice has remained almost identical to her youthful days as front singer of the Blossoms and the Crystals, solo act, and Phil Spector's secret weapon.

DARLENE LOVE: THE CONCERT OF LOVE DVD proves this fact and was filmed in 2010 and Love was in fine voice!

I had to find out more about Darlene Love when I heard the seminal Christmas song, ""Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home)"" in the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-With-the-Kranks/dp/B0007A0F4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas With the Kranks</a>. Even though I've heard that familiar voice before, I couldn't place it and was surprised to find out that Love wasn't a household name -- even though she's got an instantly recognizable singing voice; distinct, powerful and uniquely hers -- except for younger sister Edna Wright who fronted the group ""Honey Cone"" and their big hit ""Want Ads"" from the late 60s (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Take-Me-With-You-Sweet-Replies-Soulful-Tapestry-Lo/dp/B0034C24PU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Take Me With You/Sweet Replies/Soulful Tapestry/Lo</a>) who sounds similar.

Anyway, this fabulous concert showcases all of Love's songs including those recorded when she was part of a group and her solo stuff, plus the aforementioned Christmas song, and she does ""River Deep, Mountain High,"" which she wanted to do in the 60s but was regulated to the background, according to her monologue, as Spector gave that to Ike and Tina Turner.

Interspersed between the concert is some added footage of interviews with Love and ""Little"" Steven Van Zandt (Bruce Springsteen's E-Street Band member--Springsteen and Van Zandt call Love the greatest female rock singer of all time). I wish there was more interviews like this at the end or in the special features but there isn't. There aren't any special features, either.

But still even without any extras, the CONCERT OF LOVE DVD is worth it. I'm glad she finally got inducted into the Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame.

4382933,5,B004I30884,"I can't believe it took all these years for Darlene Love to have a concert on DVD. I've been a big fan from her early days with the Crystals. I saw her in Leader Of The Pack on Broadway and she made that musical. The concert on dvd is just unbelieveable. For a person her age she sings each song like she sang then back in the 60's. She sings most of her big hits and If your a fan you must have this DVD. If you don't know who she is, then get this DVD and you won't be sorry. There is only one draw back to the concert. It's not 2 hours long. It's only one hour and ten mintues long, but worth every minute. Thank you Darlene for this wonderful concert.",1302307200,,655,3.8955223880597014
4382934,5,B004I30884,"I'm a VERY ""happy camper""! Finally - after nearly 50 years there is a full length Darlene Love concert available for home video - to watch again and again! Its hard to believe that no one captured this rock and roll legend - and 2011 inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame - like this before. Sure, she shows up singing one song on some of the ""oldies show"" compilation - and usually just as part of the Crystals - and she is on most of the Rhino Home Video tapes of Shindig! (still not out on DVD, but then she's part of The Blossoms.

It took Love herself to make this happen - she is listed as one of the Producers - and I'm thankful for that. There's a lengthy review posted on Amazon listing the detailed contents (though I will point out that Bobby Soxx and the Blue Jeans has two ""x""'s, not one) so I won't rehash much of that. It's a well-done review. But I'll add a few more of my impressions.

This concert was recorded in Englewood, NJ at a performing arts center. The audience is of the age you see in those PBS oldies shows. But heck, that's my age - and probably yours - and we collected all those Love records (Crystals, Bobby Soxx, the Phil Spector Christmas Album, and her own singles. One gem performed here is the rare single ""Stumble and Fall"" which Spector never released in the 1960s. This will be new for many. Not for me though; I have the original promo 45 and have played it often over the years. Its probably my all-time favorite Love song.

Nearly every hit she had is performed in this hour-long concert. And even a ""hit"" she didn't record - Tina Turner's ""River Deep, Mountain High"".

Love is backed by a full band (plus strings), plus NINE (yep!) backup singers. (Hey, they had to recreate what Phil Spector did in the studio! There are some short song intros but, basically, its wall-to-wall music.

I'll certainly treasure this DVD and watch it a lot. You can never get too much Love! Grab it while you can and savor it. And know that Love herself will benefit from you purchase!
