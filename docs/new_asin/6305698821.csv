1058511,4,6305698821,"This movie is thoroughly enjoyable.  The scenes between Mickey Rooney (as Andy Hardy) and his blind date are hysterical.  The expressions on his parents faces when they think that this is the girl their son wants to marry are priceless.  The dance scenes have to be seen to be belived.  Of course as in all of the Andy Hardy movies with Lewis Stone as the father and Fay Holden as the mother, the parent / child conversations are wonderful.  I highly recommend this Andy Hardy movie and any others you can get your hands on.",979776000,14,524,4.473684210526316

1058590,5,6305698821,"Mickey Rooney was a consummate actor, and I love the Andy Hardy movies which highlight his abilities to be comical, vulnerable, romantic, penitent and respectfully family oriented. This is true of ""Live Laughs at Andy Hardy.""  He zooms off to college thinking he is fully in charge of his destiny when life smacks him in the face.  He gets A+ for his bravado in the dance scene with his extremely tall blind date.  That scene is double-over, riproariously hilarious!  His typical admiration for his father and his devotion to his mother are qualities we don't see in movies today.  For classic movie lovers this one is a must-see!!",1449100800,,631,4.805555555555555

1058609,4,6305698821,"Like all the ""Andy Hardy"" movies, this one is another episode dealing with life situations and solutions dealt with by a proud but somewhat naive young man (Andy) .

1058612,3,6305698821,"The quality of the transfer is so-so, mainly because this movie ended up in public domain (as no one bothered to renew the copyright on it), that also explains why it can be had so cheaply.  This is the second to last Andy Hardy movie made.  At this point, the series was dragging.  Time moved on but not so Andy Hardy.  He was rapidly approaching 30 yet still acting the goofball nincompoop.  In this film, Andy pursues Bonita Granville (as Kay), while being pursued by Lina Romay (as Isobel Gonzales).  He also ""dates"" the magnificently tall Dorothy Ford (as Coffy Smith).  Their dance sequence is hilarious (Dorothy Ford was 6'2"" and a model.  Mickey Rooney was 5'2"").  As always, the best actor/character in this movie/series was the stalwart Lewis Stone as Judge Hardy.  Brimming with common sense, he was the one who singlehandedly grounded these movies.  Sara Haden (as Aunt Milly) was also fun.  In this offering, Andy schemes, his mother stews, and Lina sings a polka.  It had a certain homespun charm that was starting to get a little sticky and gooey by this point in time.  It's a short fall to hokum.  It didn't help that Rooney's idea of acting meant doing some alarming things with his face.  Even so, they should release this entire series in a nice box set.  Blu-ray would be welcomed but I won't press my luck thinking it will happen in my lifetime (if ever).",1398124800,4,1377,4.62396694214876

1058717,3,6305698821,"This is a review of the 2001 ""Passion Productions a Division of PMC Corp."" DVD of ""Love Laughs at Andy Hardy"", and not a review of the film itself.

This edition of ""Love Laughs at Andy Hardy"" is low budget, as the cover photo and copy will immediately inform you, should you purchase this DVD.  The cover photo shows a modern building (perhaps PMC Corporation, perhaps a college) with low resolution photographs of Lewis Stone, Mickey Rooney, and Judy Garland superimposed, and the captions: ""Lewis Stone - Mickey Rooney - Bonita Granville"".  Yes, that's correct, Judy Garland's photo is captioned ""Bonita Granville"".  (Bonita Granville is in the film, not Judy Garland, just to be clear.)

The description on the back of the DVD clam shell case reads:
""Andy Hardy goes to college after returning from the war.  As usual, he is in love with Kay Wilson this time [sic], but a succession of hilarious circumstances pushes him into on [sic] frenetic situation after another.""

The DVD itself has a print of the film that is rather too bright, though not grainy.  Still, the images get washed-out periodically.  The case indicates the disc is region free, which may account for the fact that the film played with no sound in my Panasonic DVD player.  My Sony DVD player treated me to both the picture and the sound.

None of this bothered me much, since I paid $4 plus $3 shipping for the disc, so I got what I paid for.  Still, if you want a high quality DVD of this film you should look elsewhere.  Caveat emptor!",1329696000,4,1512,4.639097744360902

1058722,3,6305698821,"Based on a previous review which proported these film prints to be the best on the market, I purchased this disk.  Not so much for Andy Hardy; I wanted my own copy of Colonel Effingham's Raid.

To say that these are the best prints on the market does not necessarily mean that they are particularly good prints or that the DVD's authorship is without error.  On the contrary, Colonel Effingham's Raid is your standard public domain fare.  And the video masters used for this DVD are very challanged themselves in spots.  Glitches in the picture occur several times during each feature, and not because of the source material used.  These glitches were strictly manufacturing flaws in the DVD authorship.

All this considered, the disc's quality is still within the range of  acceptable, especially if the price is right.  My disc was purchased for less than eight dollars total.  My one major complaint is that the company cuts off the studio logos in the beginning.  I have never understood why some companies continue to do this, and others don't.  I would like to see Marengo Films cease this practice, and give us the entire film -- from begining to end.",1237248000,,1158,4.763819095477387

1058758,5,6305698821,"This is one of the 12 capers of Andy Hardy movies starring Mickey Rooney, which started production in 1939. When Andy Hardy returns home from service, his mother Emily Hardy (Fay Holden), and his father Judge James Hardy (Lewis Stone) are thrilled to see him back. Under the watchful eyes of his parents, Andy shows clear signs of a typical young man who is in love. All he wants to do is go back to college and ask his beautiful sweetheart Kay Wilson (Bonita Granville) for marriage. Things go awry whenever he tries to pop the question. Meanwhile he makes new friends at the college, and dates a much taller Coffey Smith (Dorothy Ford) who is beautiful and gracious to Andy. She offers some fine performance not only as Andy's date for a freshman dance at the college, but also as a great friend. The dance scenes with Coffey Smith are hilarious as much as the way his parents try to discover who his love interest is. Ultimately Andy discovers the real truth that his girl will not be his wife because she is getting married to a much older man for wealth and money. Disappointed and hurt, Andy tries to go to South America to work, and nothing changes his mind until he finds out who his new employer will be. Lina Romay offers another excellent performance as young family friend, Isobel Gonzales who shows interest in Andy, but the friendship remains with no luck for romance.

There is some excellent writing by William Ludwig. I highly recommend this to any parent who is in a desperate situation to talk to their sons or daughter being dumped, and they are planning to join the army or go elsewhere. The conversation between James Hardy and Andy Hardy gets high points as he makes so much sense to young Andy without hurting his feelings. The fatherly advice is very mature and thought provoking.
