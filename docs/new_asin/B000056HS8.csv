8188079,3,B000056HS8,"This is a moderately entertaining, fast paced action film. Nicholas Cage gives an engaging performance as a reformed master car thief, known as ""Memphis"" Raines. Giovanni Ribisi convincingly plays his stupid, younger brother, Kip Raines.

""Memphis"" comes home to help his younger brother, Kip, who has followed in his older brother's footsteps but is not as skilled at stealing cars. Having screwed up a major car boost, his employer, a sadistic, maniacal individual, will kill him, unless ""Memphis"" agrees to fulfil a contractual obligation of stealing fifty top of the line cars for which Kip's ""boss"" has made a commitment. The only glitch is that ""Memphis"" has a decidely short deadline in which to make his quota.

For reasons that those who view the movie will immediately discern, ""Memphis"" agrees to this thankless task. He gets his old crew together and with his former nemesis, a hard nosed detective played by Delroy Lindo, in hot pursuit, the games begin.

Look for lots of action, some great car chase sequences, and a bit of suspense. If you are looking for some mindless entertainment, then this film will fit the bill. Kick back your shoes and hang on for the ride!",1165276800,,1181,4.924623115577889
