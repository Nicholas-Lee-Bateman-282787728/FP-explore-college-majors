7789244,5,0769720501,"I got these in a different 8 DVD set containing the 3 documentaries in this set.
( I live in New Zealand and this set was zoned for that region)
They very made for Discovery Channel in 1997 if I read the Roman numerals right.
It clearly isn't by David Attenborough and are not in his league.
I nevertheless enjoyed watching them and learnt a lot.
Clearly the images are less crisp compared to HD.
Would I get them-- well, I ,like many like Attenborough and would go for his documentaries first.
These set of documentaries are  worth while if the price is reasonable

NOTE
I have reviewed both the Gorilla and Great Siberian Grizzle Documentaries at another spot
They were market in my country as

Wild Discovery Gorillas. My review is under VHS as that seemed the closest to the information I had. I tried to cut and paste but I am no computer whizz

Wild Discovery Great Siberian Grizzle. Again you need to look for the VHS label.
I fact I like both a lot. They are useful additions to other material I had

Summary.
This is a good 3 set DVD. It is currently listed at $4 and at that price is a bargain if you are interested in these animals.
After watching these DVD's I will be keen to see more on these interesting animals
The basic approach is to follow one or more families in contrasting circumstances over a time period.
In the RUSSIAN Siberian Grizzle from Emerging from the den at the end of hibernation to the return to the den and hibernation after the great salmon catching period and getting a enough stores on board to survive hibernation",1433721600,,1553,4.435087719298245

This is a region 2 set. the seller did not specify this but unfortunately I'm not able to give them a review...plus I had hoped this was a David Attenborough set and it is not. Each DVD has a different narrator. still, an ok set",1408233600,,296,4.120689655172414
