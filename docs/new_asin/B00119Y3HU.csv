8241184,3,B00119Y3HU,"I found this movie purely by accident when I searched the title ""Venus Flytrap"".  This title is really incorrect since the movie doesn't include a character named Dr. X and there is no revenge of any kind.  My only reason for buying this was the fact that its said to be written by Ed Wood Jr.  The credits that are included here are totally wrong as they are actually from a different movie.",1440892800,4,392,4.342465753424658
