6155187,3,B005SG0QFA,"Typical Japanese horror fare. Predictable with some good horror effects. Well done cinematically & acting not bad. Subtitles are not a bother for me.

6155188,4,B005SG0QFA,"This is one of the oddest of the Tomie movies. Although, I wouldn't expect anything less from the director of Robo Geisha and Mutant Girl Squad. The movie is more low key than those two films, but not by much. The film is very bizarre, with tons of odd imagery, over the top violence, intentionally jarring musical cues, and plenty of appropriately big performances. While the whole film feels almost tongue in cheek, this film also has one of the more disturbing (but appropriate) endings.

The production values are higher than Beginning and Revenge. This was obviously a theatrical release, and the increased budget shows in the slicker appearance and better visual effects. I say better, although these still aren't big budget effects. The puppets look plenty rubbery, and the cg sticks out like a sore thumb, but it all comes together to create an very interesting, entertaining experience.

If you can handle the almost comic book nature of the film, I would totally recommend Tomie: Unlimited.",1469059200,,1000,4.982035928143713

6155191,2,B005SG0QFA,"I knew this movie was in trouble from the start. When a girl is shown dropping a camera and they pan in on the Nikon strap. Then we see a Canon camera hitting the ground. Bad editing? Failed continuity? Or just poor prop management? No photographer would use a Canon camera and a Nikon strap. I know it's picky but it shows a lack of attention to detail on a scene they even shot in slo-mo for added emphasis.

My second thought was, ""THIS is Tomie? THIS is the siren that holds such power over men and elicits such anger and jealousy from women?"" I would have thought they could find a remotely attractive or, in the very least, an interesting and/or mesmerizing female character. I couldn't help thinking she was not only not the least bit attractive, but was probably the least attractive female character in the movie.

I know that sounds judgmental and harsh and her looks wouldn't matter...normally. But when her entire character is built on sexual tension, envy, lust, etc. it's kind of a big aspect to her character. I couldn't see even the most desperate of men being lured in by this Tomie.

Disjointed story (even knowing the background and reading/seeing previous versions).

This one didn't work for me. Disappointing.",1463356800,2,1231,4.711627906976744

I've seen all the Tomie movies and read all the mangas, so I'm a fan of the series.  If you've never seen the movies start with the first one released in 1999 with Miho Kanno, since it was pretty good and I would recommend reading the manga as well.",1447286400,,354,4.176470588235294

6155206,3,B005SG0QFA,"This latest Tomie film delivers some over the top entertainment.

If this is your first experience with Tomie, you might come out of it feeling a bit confused. But basically, Tomie's like a siren of sorts, who has two, very distinct affects on humans. For men, she basically causes them to fall in love with her, to the point where they want her to themselves. They will do anything for her, including killing others at her request. The hitch is, if they get to the point where they think they can't keep her anymore, they will kill her in some way. It often includes them chopping her up into little pieces.

Her effect on females is quite differnt. She generally causes a deep jealousy in them, because the girls see how love struck all the guys are with her. The girls usually gang up on her. And Tomie will often steal their boyfriends or crushes, just to spite them. She also directs the guys that she's stolen, to get back at the girls who are being mean to her.

But make no mistake, Tomie at her core, is a monster. She never really dies. She simply regenerates if she's killed. Including regenerating herself from small, chopped up pieces.

So now that you have some background on Tomie, I can safely say this film is over the top, even for a Tomie film.  And I've seen all of them. In this film, we have some of the formulas I described above. But since they've been visited before, in other Tomie films, the director seemed to be going for more of a surreal scenario. It almost felt like I was watching Tomie meets Beetlejuice, for lack of a better description. It got really crazy, especially towards the end. Some of the more interesting moments in the film were, tiny Tomie heads growing inside a lunchbox. Tomie centipede heads  running around a school, killing people. A supersize Tomie and a Tomie head trying to grow out of the body of a girl, who had her head hacked off by some of Tomie's love struck beaus.

It was weird, creepy, wild and horrifying, all at the same time. It gets to the point where everything is going nuts, but you just want to see how it all turns out in the end.

In any case, the film is offered in Japanese only, with English subtitles. No other features were available on prime.

In conclusion, I've seen all the Tomie films, so I knew where this film was coming from. But if this is your first experience with her, I suggest holding off on this one until you've watched some of the earlier films. Like all series, some are better than others. But I think you'll appreciate this one more if you do. Watching this one, out of the blue, will probably feel like getting hit by a semi-truck. Other Tomie films, that will give you a better background on her are, Tomie Replay, Tomie Rebirth, Tomie Forbidden Fruit, and Tomie Beginning. Beginning is good because it takes a story from the manga that Tomie is based on. Rebirth is a high production value film, and Tomie is portrayed older than usual. She's more like a college student, rather than a highschool girl. And the other two films were pretty good Tomie stories in their own right. There are others, that you can explore also.

Here is a list of them:
Tomie
Tomie: Another Face (This one is a set of short Tomie  Stories, based on the Tomie Mangas)
Tomie: Replay
Tomie: Rebirth
Tomie: Forbidden Fruit
Tomie: Revenge
Tomie: Beginning
Tomie vs Tomie
Tomie: Unlimited

Anyway, 3 stars for this Tomie film. It was definitely different, that's for sure.",1443139200,12,3447,4.506410256410256
8631750,1,B005SG0QFA,"I liked the first 5 Tomie movies, but this one just ruined the formula by being far too campy and ridiculous. And it's not even a case of ""it's so bad, it's good"" -- it's just bad. It took the worst aspects of the later Nightmare on Elm Street movies -- silly looking prosthetics and a move more towards comedy than horror -- and made an unwatchable mess. This is by far the worst Tomie movie, but don't let it deter you from watching the others. All of them are far better and less cheesy.",1516665600,,490,4.168421052631579
8631751,2,B005SG0QFA,Not for mature audience-very much for teens and rather silly and incoherent movie. Not recommended.,1506038400,,99,5.666666666666667
8631752,1,B005SG0QFA,"Write a review?? Oh yes, I'll write a review.  I love the Tomie series of movies.  This one should have never been made.  Noboru Iguchi is a great director for movies like Machine Girl and Zombie Ass: Toilet of the Dead, but he absolutely ruined Tomie with this pile of rotting garbage.  I like his other movies, I just think he should have left Tomie alone.  This series is not his kind of horror.  Also, I cannot agree more with previous reviewers who noted that the girl playing Tomie was ugly.  In the case of these movies, this matters very much as the whole essence of Tomie is her beauty, and casting dropped the ball on this one.  This ""Tomie"" didn't get hit with the ugly stick, she went skiing through the ugly forest and hit every tree on the way down.  I can't even believe the pedophile father wanted anything to do with her.  What they should have done was use the actress playing Tsukiko as Tomie, and vice versa.  That would have been more accurate to the story.  But the rest of the movie makes no sense, why should that part.  Then there's the crazy stuff.  Talking tumors growing from necks, miniature Tomie heads in Tupperware, Tomie heads joined to make centipedes, a school girl running around with no head, and a woman running around with her head on upside down.  These may be perfect for any of Iguchi's other movies, but they have no place in a Tomie movie.  The resulting piece of trash that I refuse to call a film is an abomination, a travesty, and a perversion of an otherwise good series of movies.  Considering that this was the last Tomie made, I blame Iguchi, who is also responsible for the ""screenplay"", for the death of the series.  The one running consistency throughout all of the installments is that Tomie could never die... but apparently all it took to kill her for good was director Noboru Iguchi.  In short, don't waste your time on this drive, you'll never get that time back.  If your bored, paint a wall and watch it dry.  Burn ants with a magnifying glass.  Buy an hourglass and keep flipping it over and over, and try to count the grains of sand.  Anything but this.  Literally anything.  One star given because Amazon will not let me log none.  So please consider it as a NEGATIVE one star.",1500163200,,2241,4.458128078817734
8631753,1,B005SG0QFA,"What just happened? The character Tomie was supposed to be attractive but she was kinda butt ugly, maybe Japanese view that differently. Aside from that little foible I have no idea what this was about. Seemed like whack-a-mole with a dead girl, you kill her and another one pops up, for no reason that I could figure out. The father-a disgusting pock marked troll of a man to start with-is a raging incestuous pedophile... guess that's where the horror is. Nonsensical piece of trash with bad ""John Carpenters The Thing (except that was cool)"" style rubber effects. Pile of trash, but marginally better than the home grown American horror drivel that permeates Prime Video now.",1488412800,,678,4.904347826086957
