3696037,5,B001MEJY8C,"It reminded me of a millennium version of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  This one is out of this world (no pun intended).  Kudos to Lambert Wilson, who plays the role of St. George's.  Riveting.  The special effects are superb...and the suspense and support acting is flawless.  Director Marc Caro has created a masterpiece.  This is his first film in over a decade...a decade in the making.  He's best known for The City of Lost Children, and Delicatessen in 1991.  This is one of the ""Dimension Extreme"" classics, so labelled because of its intense and graphic nature.  But that's what the new millennium is all about.  He takes us to the doorstep of sci-fi in the second decade of the millennium.  All 5 stars...no questions asked.",1250726400,,727,4.736
3696038,3,B001MEJY8C,"Dante 01 is a dark and engaging movie and I still think about it long after turning off the TV.

I've discovered that good French movies are often hard to predict. I tested this hypothesis over and over again as I watched Martyrs, Them and High Tension. Not until close to the end do I find myself realizing the hidden meanings behind these types of movies.

Dante 01 is no exception. It starts on a remote ship - a space station for criminally insane - orbiting around a star. Soon, viewers witness new arrivals of a doctor and another patient whose role proves mysterious until the very end of the movie.

While the new doctor integrates with the others, the patient is left to fight for his own among the insane who by the way appear well organized and quite rational. After series of incidents the viewers discover that the new arrival possess the capacity to heal wounds and take away death.

The new doctor delivers new technology to the station - nanotechnology that once injected into a patient can genetically reprogram the DNA. Not all doctors are converted to this new technology and soon there is a rift between the ranks, rift that causes the end of the station's existence.

To shorten the story, the new patient becomes a favorite among some of the wild bunch who decide to protect him rather than hurt him. Fights occur between the doctors and among the two fractions of the insane  and soon the survivors regroup to help their failing space station, which is falling apart and on a trajectory to crash on the surface pf the star.
And then the heroism and role of the new patient is revealed.

The acting is good and the story interesting. Movies in similar fashion:

3696039,3,B001MEJY8C,"We should be glad for the Dimension Extreme label, for even though it is home to a number of absurdly gory horror films that offer little other than said gore, it also helps make available some hidden foreign gems that we may not see otherwise.  It also houses this French sci-fi film Dante 01, which doesn't quite come close to being a gem, but remains worth seeing nonetheless.  Written and directed by Delicatessen and City of Lost Children co-director Marc Caro, Dante 01 stars Lambert Wilson (who you'll remember as the smarmy Frenchman from Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions) as a mysterious and seemingly mute man who arrives on a prison ship called Dante 01, and begins to exhibit otherworldly abilities and powers, including healing and resurrection.  Dubbed Saint Georges, and drawing the attention of those in charge who seek to experiment on him, it isn't long before bad things start to happen.  The first thing you'll notice about Dante 01 is that despite its low budget, the film features some dazzing imagery and brilliant camerawork by Caro.  However, the sheer incoherency of Caro's story is what reigns more apparent than anything else.  Though it is abvious that Caro's intentions of allegory are there, they get lost the longer the film runs.  Not to mention that for being an 82 minute film, Dante 01 ends up feeling like it's just plodding along towards an ending sequence that does little more than cause viewer irritation.  Rumor has it that Caro himself wasn't happy with how the film turned out, and while the film as a whole isn't a terrible mess, you can't exactly blame Caro for feeling that way.  All in all though, Dante 01 is a different sort of sci-fi that is definitely worth checking out just because it is a different sort of thing, and for fans of Caro's previous work, even though Dante 01 doesn't compare, the film is still worth a look at the very least.",1242950400,5,1900,4.750759878419453

8321149,4,B001MEJY8C,"Dante 01 is a French language SciFi film released in 2008 with a reported budget of 8 million Euros. The story takes place aboard a mental hospital space station, full of dangerous patients and staff members of questionable ethics. The plot revolves around the mysterious new patient called Saint George, who behaves quite curiously and might possess some hidden powers (further spoilers avoided). Sanity, mystery, and religion are central themes, while the setting is claustrophobic and unpleasant. More than anything, Dante 01 reminds me of Alien 3, although it is more psychological and mystical and less horror-esque and action filled. (However, comparing Dante 01 to any big budget Hollywood movie would be quite unfair, so I shan't do that). All in all, I enjoyed Dante 01 quite a bit and would recommend it to those who like interesting and fresh approaches. It should be mentioned thought, that I did not understand the film's ending at all... perhaps I'm just slow ;)",1376524800,,976,5.068322981366459

8321151,4,B001MEJY8C,"I was expecting a very high degree of quality for this MC's first film as a director and my expectations were either met or surpassed. The film had a distinctive visual style that I've come to expect from watching his work with Jeunet; but the script was what really made it exceptional. Not at all your typical sci-fi bloody shoot 'em up, this film actually had a purpose much as A Clockwork Orange did 42 years ago.",1363564800,,417,4.428571428571429
8321152,2,B001MEJY8C,"There seems to be a kind of curse affecting French directors every time when they try to make a SF movie. Most of them fail because of low budgets, but here it was clearly not the case - with 8 millions Euros director Marc Caro had quite a comfortable war treasure, at least by Old Continent standards.

This film suffers from another frequent weakness in French SF films - a very weak scenario. As one of previous reviewers noticed, for this film Marc Caro clearly looked for inspiration in other films: ""Alien3"" and ""Green Mile"", and I think also a little bit in ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"". But mostly he failed to mix his cocktail right and the result is very disappointing.

The initial idea of a secret penal space station orbiting a vulcanic planet in a remote star system, allowing the mysterious ""Company"" to conduct experiences on dangerous criminals and psychopaths seemed promising. The names of all persons present on board were also well chosen: the chief of station is Charon, the female doctor is Persephone and the inmates are called Cesar, Lazarus, Moloch, Buddha, Attila and Raspoutine (there are also two security guards, BR and CR, but they are less important to the plot). Then all the delicate balance of this ""little hell"" (which by the way appears in space as a cross...) is bouleversed by the arrival of two newcomers: a new doctor, Elisa and a new inmate, ""Unknown"", but soon called ""Saint George"", because of a tattoo on his shoulder. Oh, by the way, everybody in the film is bald...

That covers the first five minutes of the film. It could be a really good film with such a starting point - but sadly it isn't. It is very slow. People act absurdly. There is a lot of weird visions which will not be explained. People vomit a lot. Dialogs are very poor, with great wisdom moments like ""Do not give me that sh-t about God"" and ""Oh, me you know, human kind - what do I care"" being maybe the most interesting things people say. Elisa shows her boobies. A fat guy eats a lot - and he is a very messy eater. Oh no, one of the psychopaths is a real psychopath - who would have thought that? The main ""hero"" says ONE word! And then, there is the ""Deux Ex Machina"" ending, which is so ridiculous that I laughed out loud.

I spend a rather bad moment watching this film. The only reason I give ""Dante 01"" two stars is the visual aspect - it was done nicely and the gallery of (mostly butt ugly) faces is also a very interesting thing. I would advise against watching this film, except if you are a fan of French cinema or very much into cinematographic curiosities.",1348531200,2,2591,4.471458773784355
