1048965,2,6305511934,"City Hunter fans and general anime fans of the world a few words of advice, DO NOT BUY THIS ANIME! I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS ANIME, RENT IT IF YOU MUST BUT DON'T WASTE $25 ON THIS! If you must buy this title then at  least get the dubbed version it is cheaper. This film has lame animation, a  down right stupid story, the characters are annoying and the only desent  action scene, the one thing that stops this from getting only one star, in  the entire film is at the very ending. ADV Films is really desperate for  money if they have decided to release this tape on the market. If you want  true action then stick with any of the other City Hunter videos. Warning  this film contains Violence, Language, brief Nudity and Mature Themes.  Suggested age is 13 and up.",961200000,,766,4.270833333333333

7891812,4,6305511934,"I loved it! Which is probably a very strange thing for a girl to say, considering Ryo's personality. I fell in love with all of the characters almost immediately when I watched the series, and this is more of them. That said, the movies rarely measure up to the series. The series follows the manga, while the movies are made up out of the script-writers' imaginations, rather than the creator's. I always get the feeling that the scriptwriters for the City Hunter movies were trying just slightly too hard, and skew the characters just a little. Rather like what happens to your typical Disney sequel, but not quite as bad as that.",1403481600,,632,4.651785714285714
7891813,4,6305511934,"This Japanese movie is similiar to the animated TV series (1987), which was based on the manga series (1958 - 1991), by Tsukasa Hojo.  There is also a Hong Kong movie staring Jackie Chan (1993), and a Korean TV series staring Lee Min Ho (2011).  Wikipedia has a disambiguation, and more detailed descriptions of these productions and of the actors.  The Hong Kong and Korean versions are very different from the origional Japanese version.
City Hunter, Ryo Seaba is a faithful adaptation of the manga.",1355702400,,501,4.870588235294117
7891814,5,6305511934,"This is a must have for anime fans if you are into smart gunfights, and easily charm by beautiful women then I highly recommend this title. It has everything including humour, unforgettalbe music, and very funny in parts.",1093824000,2,221,4.842105263157895
7891815,5,6305511934,"City Hunter is one of the 1st anime I ever watched, and something about the silly sex humor and gun battles always caught my eye. I'll be honest, its an older anime so it's not the best animation nor are a lot of the topics current (again, because of the age). But it is BY GOD FUNNY! Especially the subtitled version of .357 Magnum. I think its worth a buy especially if you just want to laugh your head off. City Hunter is made for those who wanna watch an anime to laugh and laugh hard. I know I did. I think it's worth it and then some.",1007424000,3,540,4.0092592592592595
7891816,4,6305511934,".357 Magnum is a very good movie, but those familiar with the other City Hunter movies will notice that this one's a bit lacking. The plot tends to drag very often, more than the Motion Picture, lacking the constant action and excitement that City Hunter usually provides. There's still some humor which is handled pretty well in the dub, and an awesome final raid scene. City Hunter: .357 is still worthy of a purchase, but it's not the best one.",992908800,2,447,4.6
7891817,5,6305511934,"For a movie made in 1990, its pretty damn good. My favorite part is when Joe's partner blows the wall open and comes in shooting. The music is classic 80's rock which is really great if you have a sweettooth for classic rock. Everytime Joe protects a different women. This time its a piano player. Out of all the women Joe protects, this has to be the worst drawn one ever. But no matter. There is still the great stuff you love about City Hunter in .357 Magnum. Joe's cool car, great action and the infamous Big Mallet which Joe encounters everytime. Ha ha ha. With comedy and action, this is an anime that would make the directors of Miami Vice proud.",980121600,3,653,4.360655737704918
