7817019,5,6301933354,"Since the age of 6, I have been fascinated by English stories and ideas. As I grew into the turbulence of adolescence, I chose virile and dynamic heroes, to model my clumsy attempts of coolness after; mostly British. While in college, I checked this VHS out of my local public library and it was like a drill tapping into an oil deposit;  pressure released after an eternity under ground.

This program is a flyby tour of historical buildings, sites and ruins that link England's past to the present. Frequently, the filmmakers focus on a site of particular interest: Syon House, Chatsworth, Blenheim Palace, the City of Bath, etc. There are also a few festivals highlighted: the Henley Royal Regatta, Trooping the Color, the Parade of the Knights of the Garter, etc. Neolithic sites also feature prominently: Stonehenge, Avesbury Stone Circle, the Uffington White Horse, the Cerne Abbas Giant, etc. To many English people, these places are as much a part of their psyche as the Washington Monument, the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls are to an American. Not everyone has visited them, but you still know they are out there somewhere; part of your collective heritage.

This video will seem very long and drawn out to the individual who does not have some kind of curiosity about England. If you feel any faint Anglophilic tendencies stirring in your soul, this video will be an overwhelming experience.

When I first saw this video, the internet did not exist in its present form. Therefore, I wrote out lists of people, places and things I had never heard of and looked them up at my library. When I finally visited in 2005, I felt at home. It is difficult to explain but, I know that my imagination has been wed to this place and people; this video performed the ceremony.

The photography is beautiful, the music is idyllic and stirring and the narrator's voice is oddly soothing...for the right person. The odds of Reader's Digest releasing this Travel video on DVD are probably a million to one. But, if it does, I will definitely purchase it, to replace my VHS copy, which is almost completely worn out.",1223337600,2,2110,4.785714285714286

7817021,5,6301933354,"Of all the series of his I grew up with, it seemed to be that after the typical Allen cliches, series continuity techniques (no one ever changes clothes except in this series..), and implausible science, the cast and direction shines through remarkably.  The entire cast is MUCH, MUCH stronger than in previous series outings, and despite the pressure to reenact the boy-buffoon-robot triangle from LIS (which mercifully dissipated as the series went on..), all the characters are used intelligently, with much more maturity, a dash of depth and even grittiness, with the occasional conflict and fist-fighting among the leads.  Don Matheson simply rocks in this area, his character maintaining an appropriate amount of visual intensity and pressure in climatic scenes that would have otherwise gone limp and laughable.

I have the fondest memories of this series, and especially the themes they built on in the second series (anti-war, tolitarian society intrique, etc).  A truely classic show which has aged very, very well, worthy of many hours of enjoyment.  Gary Conway definitely brought a sophisicated sense of pressure and depth to his role, definitely being the COOLEST commander around, bar none.  Enjoy!",1197676800,,1213,5.324607329842932
7817022,3,6301933354,"""Land of the Giants"" was the last and, in my opinion, least of producer Irwin Allen's great sci-fi TV series of the '60s. Like his other shows -- ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"" ""Lost in Space"" and ""Time Tunnel"" -- ""Giants"" was a rip-roaring futuristic fantasy with lots of action, incredible (for its day) special effects and cliff-hanging excitement, usually with a lot of silliness thrown in to boot. For the most part, the adventure stories worked well and the overall concept was unique, even though the science was usually laughably implausible. The show's biggest drawback, though, was that the Fitzhugh-Barry relationship tried to mirror too closely the Dr. Smith-Will Robinson dynamic from ""Lost in Space.""

Those who grew up with the show will certainly enjoy the sense of nostalgia watching these episodes again will engender. And there will probably be quite a few unintended laughs and a few grimaces at just how corny it all was. But a generation of people, myself included, will love to have this series on DVD.

If you're dying to see ""Land of the Giants"" once again, there is good news. According to the ""TV Shows on DVD"" website, Fox is planning to release the entire series (all 51 shows of its two seasons) in one big package later in 2007. As with the other Irwin Allen series that Fox has released, the episodes will look sharp and the set will probably include a handful of interesting extras. But mainly, the Fox set will be authorized (ie. not a bootleg), the episodes will be restored to decent quality, and it won't cost $235! So be patient, TV lovers, the real deal will be coming soon.",1169251200,23,1617,4.710247349823321
