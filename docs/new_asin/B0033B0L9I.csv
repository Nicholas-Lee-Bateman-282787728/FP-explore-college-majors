One might almost be able to deduce the outline of the course from the lectures themselves.  This particular set of lectures deals with the scope of sizes and times involved in understanding the universe.  It also gives a thorough discussion of how astronomers derive their understanding of the universe through the interpretation of light and of how the light of the universe is collected by various types of telescope. It also goes into some detail over the phenomenon of eclipses.

Professor Filippenko is charming and engaging in his style of address and exhibits enthusiasm for his subject.  The graphic illustrations are adequate to help the student understand the content, but don't expect the magnificence of a Discovery Channel or PBS documentary on the same topics.  There is more a sense of the classroom than of the magnificence of the universe in the visual format of these lessons.

Although the courses date to the late 1990s and much has recently been discovered in astrophysics, nothing in the lessons is actually out of date; that is the student won't be receiving any inaccurate information.

If you've already read a lot on your own about the topic, you may find the course is a little lame.  In that case, you may enjoy predicting what the instructor will say about a topic before he does.  It's a fine confirmation of what you've already learned.

For those who've never had an astronomy course this one is very good because it focuses on concepts rather than on the mathematics of the physics.  There are a few formulae, but they are well discussed and fairly simple and direct.  The instructor goes through them logically so that the student should see how the various components are related to one another--that is afterall what the purpose of the equations are.  While the professor discusses scientific notation and large and small numbers and the concept of the light year, he does so mostly to reveal the vast differences in the sizes of the different constituents of the universe and where people stand in regard to them.

For the student this should be a good way of supplementing and reviewing at a more self-controlled pace the topics that will appear in classroom courses at their own institution.  Every avenue of learning that is availed will propel the student towards their own personal academic goals.",1283558400,2,2469,4.896634615384615
