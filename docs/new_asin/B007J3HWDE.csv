5090779,5,B007J3HWDE,Season 7 was the best ever. I really enjoyed this seasons contest. It offered Gordon at his best and the winner did an excellent job handleing the pressure. The season gave us an opportunity to see another side of Gordon with his wife and children and even his Mother.,1343088000,,268,4.489795918367347
5090780,5,B007J3HWDE,hell's kitchen is one of my favorite show love it and am glad I now have the dvd I watch it all the time thank you,1342310400,,114,3.423076923076923
5090781,4,B007J3HWDE,"The right person wins but getting there is torture. This crew had very few stand outs. Ben gets my vote for most annoying contestant ever, what surprised me was how few people commented on his whiney egotism throughout. I guess he made a good foil for the person who eventually won.",1341100800,,282,4.549019607843137
5090782,5,B007J3HWDE,"this is a very good show, i enjoy it alot, i hope that next season will be even more intense",1338768000,,92,3.65
5090783,5,B007J3HWDE,"well, this is the 7th season.  questions are being raised on who came up with the idea. many of what you see on primetime, and BBC on cable have been idea's that have been talked about or have been done in england with success. reasons for shows ending there and coming to america?  personalities clashed.  for this topic, hells kitchen came from a show which started in england called ""Boiling Point"". the show was a little different. if you read both his books on his life they go into this in much more detail and explain it much better than me. however, ""boiling point"" was the same show more or less, but they used famous people who didn't know how to cook. some knew a little. people went nuts, fighting, yelling and screaming, and that was off camera. ramsay in his book said that outside pressures got to him and he gained way to much weight and he admitted to being a little to far off his rocker when filming that show. anyway, they changed it to what you see now in hells kitchen. a much more organized show. a much more relaxed ramsay believe it or not. and  this season is great. you have a little bit of everything. this season they seemed to want to add sex appeal. you have a few girls on here who are to say the least very attractive. and the one hollie is amazingly sexy. dark hair, and blue eyes, blue as the pacific ocean blue. but lighter. and for the ladies, yes they have men for you to look at to. but the dynamic of the show is the same, new turns and twists and the sex appeal they pushed kinda hard in this season. but never a dull moment. you still have your nut jobs, people you think cant function in life much less in a kitchen with ramsay, and tough men and woman who hang in there. i won't ruin the ending. although i disagree with it.  its everything you expect and more. much more. they really try to give you something new every season. the challenges, the rewards, and the punishments are all fun to watch and some are new as well. you cant go wrong. if your a fan don't just watch one show. buy the season especially this one, and you cant go wrong. i love all the seasons. as i said before i have my favorites. but this season is as good as any. while im writing this the 8th season is done. and i own that one to. for ramsay fans its a must and i promiss you cant go wrong. its still unique after all these years, and i still say all the other shows have ramsay to thank for their careers. in my opinion.  watch and enjoy my friends......and seasons one through five are just hysterical and amazing to watch as well.  i cant wait for the next season, season 9 to start.",1295913600,,2609,4.206
5090784,5,B007J3HWDE,"My hat is off to the guys who came up with this idea. If you has told me I would watch a Chef competition where the head chef was a madman most of the time AND that I would do it for 7 years I would have told you what an idiot you were. Here we are 7 years later and I am still loving it :) I never tire of this show although the quality of the chefs I think is getting less but then again how many idiots can you find that will put themselves through this ""Hell's Kitchen"" when they can just live a normal life . Some you can pick out early and you wonder just how long he will keep them around and some you wonder if they can make it to the end. While you may not agree with some of his decisions I always think the 2 best chefs are left at the end (not the best of the 2 always wins IMHO).

BOTTOM LINE: This stuff is addicting, while I know it cannot go on forever I am going to need drugs to detox it when it finally does go off the air but ratings are still high so I assume there will be a few more seasons and I will be there like a entertained zombie watching everyone of them :)",1280016000,4,1088,3.7304347826086954

5090786,2,B007J3HWDE,The show thats on now Iwouldn't hire any one of them. All the swearing with little children in the resturant is horriable. I don't think I could eat after lisening to that. These people are suppose to be chief's they don't even act like they can boil water. I record it so I can flip past the BS.,1398988800,,296,4.120689655172414

5090788,5,B007J3HWDE,"Recently, I had ""several"" bad experience with Amazon due to Shippers, poor information on the product, not able to get the product in the two promised with prime  and poor shipping.
This last order was going to be my last if it was not done correctly and the least amount of work I had to do to get the service i was promised.  Well, I was surprised  the Shipping came by the carrier that i need it too, got to my place on time and the product is in good shape. As a Result of these correction, I purchased the Prime Membership. I think that a company that is willing to work hard to show they will do almost anything to make the customer happy is worth supporting . Amazon is one of the the few companies Great Corp.",1397692800,,717,4.143884892086331
5090789,5,B007J3HWDE,Great show! I love Gordon Ramsay and this is my favorite cooking show. My favorite season of Hell's Kitchen as well!,1386288000,,116,4.571428571428571
5090790,4,B007J3HWDE,Now I have all the seasons through season 8. These people must be crazy to even go on the show.,1384905600,,95,3.8
5090791,5,B007J3HWDE,Always like this show.  Getting all of the set .  Always like the different things they have to go through to get to the next step.,1378339200,,131,4.0
5090792,1,B007J3HWDE,"As I mentioned about season 6 the disks were scratched, many episodes did not play, and it ruined the experience.  I really feel ripped off.",1377043200,,140,4.6
5090793,5,B007J3HWDE,We have 8 seasons of Hell's Kitchen and will continue to buy more. We watch Gordon Ramsay for both entertainment and we always pick up a few tricks about cooking as well after watching the shows. Hell's Kitchen is our favorite of Gordon Ramsay's series.,1372032000,,253,4.644444444444445
5090794,5,B007J3HWDE,once you watch one season you are hooked and then have to see them all. it is even more fun watching them again because you know who is going to win so you the people who say i have this you can say no you don't this person is going to win.,1360886400,,240,3.6346153846153846
5090795,5,B007J3HWDE,"Hell's Kitchen is my guilty pleasure.  I can't cook to save my life, but I really enjoy watching these chefs get ripped a new one by Ramsey each and every episode.  It pretty much follows the same formula as the previous 6 seasons, so you know what you're getting.",1359158400,,264,4.36734693877551
5090796,5,B007J3HWDE,"I would recommend this site for any dvd season purchase. They find what you need, and it arrives exactly when promised.",1358726400,,119,4.714285714285714
5090797,5,B007J3HWDE,"This I think is my favorite season yet. All of these are hilarious and what's funny to me is, when Gordo is teaching
Something I learn it! But his fowl mouth and the show doesn't disappoint.",1357257600,,190,4.305555555555555
5090798,5,B007J3HWDE,Not as good as the first 5 seasons but still unique. Gordan Ramsay is an awesome and amazing chef. Great!,1355875200,,105,4.3
5090799,3,B007J3HWDE,"Halfway through this season I found myself thinking that none of the competitors were anywhere near Gordon Ramsey Executive Chef caliber.  One guy seemed close, but I honestly wondered, ""How is Ramsay going to deal with this?"".  Well, the winner just seemed to come out of nowhere and exhibited nothing more than really solid line-cooking skills.  Not surprisingly, the winner ended up not getting the gig after all.  After watching the finale, I went back to episode one to review the 'signature dish' challenge.  The winner's dish was a pathetic, misguided, clumsy mess.  How does one go from that, to the stellar winning dishes that come out later?  I expect a little bit of 'fakeness', but man, this season really bummed me out.",1350604800,3,732,4.902439024390244
5090800,4,B007J3HWDE,this dvd was great i loved it forgot how bad autum was and ben what a jerk if he was working at a restrurant i went to i would walk out,1346371200,,135,3.3870967741935485
5090801,5,B007J3HWDE,Now that Hell's Kitchen has been renewed for two more seasons (11 and 12) I look forward to seeing them and then adding them to my collection! As each new set of DVD's comes out I purchase them and the whole family enjoys that season all over again. The unedited (for language)version is always more fun (it's amazing how much swearing goes on!). These type of shows make you a bit wary of what goes on back in the kitchen.,1344816000,,423,4.3
5090802,5,B007J3HWDE,Gordan Ramsey Book Humble Pie is such a great look into  the life of Gordan Ramsey. He had a very tough life but he had the determination to not end up like his Father. Cooking was his passion early in his life and is still a passion in his life today> The book is such a great insite to the not so great life he had to endured! I would highly recommend the book to all Gordan Ramsey fans and people who are not!!!,1344384000,,414,3.9285714285714284
5090803,5,B007J3HWDE,I'm never dissapointed in Gordon Ramsey!!!  I hope he keeps bringing them out. Waiting on the next one!!!  Wish I could cook like that!!!,1344211200,,137,4.666666666666667
5090804,4,B007J3HWDE,"Season 7 is different from previous seasons in many ways. Ramsay gets to show off this talent, wit and family a lot this time. Also the difference between strong chef's and weak chef's become very obvious as many chef's continually preform bad, but unlike previous seasons, there are too many of them to isolate all the problems.

Spoilers below at this piont (To avoid find these ***) Soilers below at this piont (To avoid find these ***)

This season also is different as one team of chefs constantly outpreform the other. Out of 20 possible wins one team only recives 5(some are unjust and two are shared with the other team), while the other revices 14(but clearly should've won some loses or are safe dispite losing).
Also the teamwork that helped seasons 5 and 6 loses some steam as rivalries spring up everywhere. Also for the first time, I feel Ramsay made the wrong decision in the final two. The winner did deserve final two, but I feel like the other should've taken the prize, as I feel we got more time with that chef.
