8683947,1,B00OJTEGTE,"Probably one of the worst instrument purchases I ever made.  Aside from the gold hardware, I love the look.  But, I thought I would be able to live with the gold...I mean, I play guitar but I'm not a 'guitarist', if you know what I mean.  Guitar sounds fine but boy is it a piece of junk!  I upgraded the tuners to Grover which didn't fit the same way so it left screw holes in the headstock...fine, whatever, but then the cable jack fell INSIDE the guitar after rehearsal one evening.  I managed to fix it myself but a couple weeks later, during practice, I turned up the volume knobs only to discover the one for the front pickup is nearly falling off.  I should've gotten the Epiphone I wanted off off Craigslist.  Do not buy guitars from this manufacturer!!  - update...after further playing (trying to make the most of this sad purchase) the strap peg by the neck just came off at rehearsal. I mean, it's like they used Elmer's glue to make this thing.  I'm bruised from kicking myself over and over and over.",1438387200,,1014,4.408602150537634
8683948,5,B00OJTEGTE,"Great guitar, similar to more expensive instruments. Sounds like the 1950's, smooth action. Thanks again.",1419897600,,105,6.066666666666666
8683949,5,B00OJTEGTE,This guitar is gorgeous and plays very well. It has that vintage tone just like more expensive and older models. An all around great instrument.,1419552000,,144,4.8
8683950,5,B00OJTEGTE,I am quite happy with the guitar.  Upgraded the strings for a much nicer sound.,1416355200,2,79,4.266666666666667
