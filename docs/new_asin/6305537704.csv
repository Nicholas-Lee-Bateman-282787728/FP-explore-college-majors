1043914,1,6305537704,"I watched this because I like Rapaport, but he can't save this jumbled mess of a film. A movie this ridiculous should make the most of its ridiculousness, but the laughs here are few and far between; a few clever  morsels tossed into a stew of pointlessness.",945561600,,258,4.48936170212766
1043915,4,6305537704,"Being a great Coen Brothers fan, I expected much of this film directed by the Coen's storyboard artist J. Todd Anderson, and written by Anderson and Ethan Coen. Let me say simply that it is not a great film. In fact, as a  film, it is not even very good. Then why the four stars? I rate it highly  because it has spectacular imagery, a sometimes hilarious script, and the  filmakers did not set out to make a great film. They did exactly what they  wanted to do. They created a often hilarious and always entertaining story  of a chiropractor by day, wrestler by night who avenges the deaths of his  parents by curing spinal disalignment everywhere. Cheers to Mr. Rapaport  and Michael Jeter for going all out. Anderson shows some promise with a  style much like John Waters. Elvis and the ""All Wrestlers Call""  are two highlights. Please enjoy and rent all Coen films if you have not  previously seen them.",943228800,6,907,4.54320987654321

7891010,3,6305537704,I ordered the movie which I wanted in DVD but I could only find it in VHS. I watched it and the only thing I did not like about it was the Spanish sub titles. I feel that Amazon should have indicated that the VHS had Spanish sub titles on the order form.,1326067200,,254,3.811320754716981
7891011,5,6305537704,"Although it's wacky, this is the best chiropractic movie ever made. It may be a turnoff for some audiences (especially chiropractors with no sense of humor) since our star, Michael Rappaport, gets a bit wild in the film.

It's funny stuff that's full of inside chiropractic jokes, hints of chiropractic philosophy, and mentions of maintaining spinal integrity for better living (although the methods in the film are rather radical).

This has become a collector's item, and may be tough to get a hold of. Recommended viewing for all doctors of chiropractic as it will tickle your funny bone and have you rooting for truth, justice, and the chiropractic way.",1210982400,,657,5.018348623853211
7891012,4,6305537704,"This film was recommended to me by a friend who's opinion I value and therefore I watched the film with him.  This film is interesting if you  look into it, but a lot of people probably aren't digging into the  psychological aspects of this movie.  I found the scenes with the disabled  to be particularly funny because they were handled a lot differently than  most films that portray the handicapped.  A lot of people have  misconceptions about handicapped people and most movies just feed that  ignorance to the point where the ignorance becomes mainstream thought - in  the same manner that our minds were tainted against African Americans, the  Japanese (during WWII), or Latin Americans today.  But this film goes  against the grain of pop culture and makes fun of our misconceptions and  prejudices.  It exposes our ludicrous thinking that we can understand the  disabled just by watching movies about their situations.  Well . . .  perhaps we can by watching more movies made in this style.
  On top of  that, it is a very interesting movie to watch and hilariously (and  sometimes quite badly - to the point of almost laughing at itself) using  the Naked Man as a symbol for modern prejudice.  It's overdone, but I  believe that was their intention - so it can be pulled off.
  All in all  - the ultimate mark of a movie is whether you would watch it again or not.  I would have to say I would, if only to bring myself possibly a little  closer to understanding my own faults and exposing my own prejudices -  wherever they may lie.",966124800,6,1541,4.5962962962962965
7891013,4,6305537704,"The Naked Man definitely has a Coen-esque flavor, but it's more darkly humorous than, say, Raising Arizona.  It starts off slow but about an hour into the movie when ""The Naked Man"" has gone nuts, you may begin  to wonder if Terry Gilliam just took over the directing chores or if this  is some bizarre dark side track in The World According to Garp.
Highly  recommended if you like your comedy weird and with a body count.  But on  the other hand if you're expecting ""The Wedding Singer"" you'll be  left scratching your head.",961113600,3,526,4.531914893617022
7891014,5,6305537704,"I feel bad that I enjoyed this movie especially as much as I did. Frankly as far as style and technique goes from a production stand point this is a about as bad as it gets. Yet I love it beyond words. As far as I'm  concerned J. Todd Anderson is a genius. I was aprehensive about renting it  in the first place, I had seen a preview for it on Lock Stock and two  Smoking Barrels. It seemed oddly funny and I heard the word Coen which to  me defines great comedy but God did I feel weird on the phone asking the  clerk if the ""Naked Man"" was available! I began watching it and  laughed occaisonallly and then an oversized red handcapped van came  lumbering up a hill, it was here that I comtamplated turning it off. I  thought this movie would join the ranks of the countless others who have  either made merciless fun or grossly misportrayed the handicapped. For  example ""Walking on Air"" and Fox's ""Family Guy"" and  ""Malcolm in the Middle."" And granted it did misportray and made  it's share of fun of the handicapped villain played brilliantly by Michael  Jeeter. With one key difference never before seen, it added it's own  demension and made as much fun of the adverage person and their hilarious  misconceptions of the disabled. I can dubbly appreciate this aspect of the  film because I am both disabled (cerbral palsy) and have a degree of spine  curvature which is also made humorous in this exquisite comedy. i wouldn't  be a bit suprized if J. Todd Anderson were disabled himself because he  shows remarkable insight into the daily trials and annoyances of disabled  life and makes them incredibly funny. I will buy this movie as soon as it  becomes available for the mass market and I suggest you do too.",953683200,7,1717,4.491909385113269
