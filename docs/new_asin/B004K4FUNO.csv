4393731,5,B004K4FUNO,I love this movie. I rented it for an essay that I was writing and I ended up watching it four times while I had it. A small act of kindness really does make a difference.,1353628800,2,171,3.7777777777777777

Incredible story from start to finish. I saw it many months ago on HBO and have waited so long to be able to purchase it. The story is impacting and just as the title reads, a small act can grow to a massive harvest.",1343692800,,355,6.12
4393733,5,B004K4FUNO,"My wife Gail and I watched ""A Small Act"" this evening.  What a great film.  The movie perfectly captures the spirit of Your Mark on the World.

The movie is about a Swedish holocaust survivor, Hilde Back, who casually decided to sponsor a child in Kenya, and the boy she sponsored, Chris Mburu, who, created a foundation in her name to sponsor similarly situated kids.

Chris grew up in a family without the means to keep him in primary school, but was highest scoring student in the district when he was in school.  With Hilde's sponsorship, he stayed in school, completing primary and secondary school, and graduated from college in Kenya.  He then completed a masters degree at Harvard.

He now works to prevent human rights abuses in his job working for the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland.

Along the way, he worked through the Swedish embassy in Kenya to find Hilda.  She was both shocked and thrilled to find her name on the new foundation.  Chris and HIlde have now built a close relationship.",1338336000,2,1007,4.702857142857143
4393734,5,B004K4FUNO,"This is a beautiful movie!!  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  I originally saw it at Ebertfest 2011, and had to purchase it for my mother.  If you generally agree with Roger Ebert's taste in movies, then you'll love this one!",1330992000,,230,4.560975609756097
4393735,5,B004K4FUNO,"This documentary is in a sense about a butterfly effect that directly impacts human beings.  It is a story of a teacher in Sweden who decides to sponsor a boy in Kenya, so he can get a high school education.  It is a story of that boy, who after graduating from High School, earns a scholarship to Harvard University and eventually graduates from Harvard Law School, works for the United Nations, and decides to start his own scholarship program for disadvantaged children like himself.  It is story about three of those children in present Kenya who are studying as hard as they can, working as hard they can to earn one of the coveted scholarships.  I defy anyone not to fall in love with any of these kids.
The movie shows us how a small act (hence the title) can have ripples yielding positive results we can barely imagine.
As a child psychiatrist, I also like to recommend this movie to parents of teenagers and pre-teenagers who have a jaded view of school and learning.  I think they need to see how in other parts of the world, children are trying with all their might to succeed in school, knowing that success or failure can literally mean life or death for their families.  Maybe children here will better appreciate what we so often take for granted if they see this.",1328054400,3,1280,4.543478260869565
4393736,5,B004K4FUNO,"This film should be required viewing for middle school students.  We take for granted the basic creature comforts we enjoy daily: running water, toilets, electricity, solid homes.  In a small African village, the children's only hope for secondary (high school) education is to get a scholarship.  They study for weeks to take a difficult aptitude exam.  Their scores must be high enough to win a scholarship or trust.  This is often the entire family's only hope for support.
The story also features light humor, inspiration and hope.  Through a ""Sponsor a Child"" program, we learn of a boy in the 1970's who is sponsored by a woman in Sweden (equivalent of $40/month today) and is able to attend secondary school.  He continues to university, wins Fullbright scholarship to Harvard to study Human Rights Law.  He works in many organizations promoting human rights.  He begins a sponsorship program in his home village named after his benefactor, Hilde Back.  He finally meets his sponsor and both are moved, thrilled.  A winning film full of depth of emotion, blight, spirit and hope.",1321833600,2,1086,5.011173184357542
4393737,5,B004K4FUNO,A wonderful documentary! It's inspiring to see how a simple act of kindness can make such a huge difference in people's lives. I saw it on TV and decided I had to purchase it for others to see.,1318896000,,193,4.105263157894737
4393738,5,B004K4FUNO,"Our local university sponsored a screening of A Small Act. As I watched I recalled my own experience in a Maasai village where I first became aware of the hunger for education shared by young people in villages with barely the means for daily living. They had some early schooling that accounted for their use and understanding of the English language but in order to continue their education, financial sponsorship was needed.  A Small Act puts this story on the wide screen for a wider audience to share my sense of ""what if?"" for our highly motivated and appreciative third world neighbors. The producer of A Small Act attended the screening and shared her experiences of trying to get this story to the screen with very limited resources. The story was brought to her attention while she was attending the University of Nairobi. She managed to engage a friend who served the dual role as videographer/producer and those two women made a way out of no way to get this story on video. The story behind the story that she shared was almost as entertaining and informative as the story of Hilde's gift and Chris' determination.",1303603200,19,1127,4.75
4393739,5,B004K4FUNO,"Yes...there are many horrors in the world today -  TV news floods us with stories of environmental degradation, terrible crimes, foreclosures out of control, wall street greed. So, from time to time, it is worthwhile to remember that there are random acts of kindness that can create waves of ""the good"". This is such a story

A child who was rescued from the Nazi holocaust - Hilda Back - later became a schoolteacher. Because she was rescued by a small act of charity, she wanted to give something back to another person.  So...she supported an African child  - Chris Mburu - from Kenya as a charitable act through those Jewish or Christian charity organizations.  Food and school made it possible for this young man to pull himself up from dark poverty. Eventually he became a lawyer, went to Harvard, and even became a chief advocate for human rights as an important employee of the United Nations.  And he has gone back to his country to provide education in the midst of bitter civil war and abject poverty.  His goal - only education will ""enlighten"" the young to move towards tolerance and economic sustainability.

The recipient of Hilde Back's charity has returned the gift.  He has set up a small educational fund to give - every year - 10 high school scholarships to African children  It is likely these boys and girls will become leaders; and so, the wave of goodness continues.

The film compellingly details the strength of will of young people desperate for education in their 3rd world environment of terrible poverty, sickness, and war -  a determination of spirit that is usually lacking in America where our educational gifts are taken for granted and squandered.

Overall, the film has the ""feeling"" of an episode of ""CNN's HEROES"".  The bottom line is that, yes, it is a story of heroes.  I truly hope the film will generate an avalanche of charity.",1284854400,41,1871,4.767080745341615
4393740,5,B004K4FUNO,"""A Small Act"" is a compelling documentary which highlights not only the importance of education and working hard but how small acts of kindness can have a wave even tsunami effect - power of one. A must see for all who  belong to the human race.",1280016000,3,245,4.326086956521739
4393771,5,B004K4FUNO,"Other reviews criticized the documentary for being too slow and including irrelevant material. It's not the fast-paced world of instant gratification that we have come to know in the Western world..I felt that the pace was appropriate. It's a story that is, at times, difficult to watch, but wonderfully told and very inspirational.",1416700800,2,332,5.283018867924528

4393775,5,B004K4FUNO,"Every parent and every child at every school should be made to watch this amazing documentary which teaches us lessons on so many levels - we learn the power and importance of giving, however small the gift; we are shown the value of education and how special our teachers are; and we are taught to appreciate building an ethic of hard work and resilience in our kids. Brilliant film!",1395878400,,384,4.579710144927536
4393776,5,B004K4FUNO,The lives of everyone in this film stayed with me long after watching it.  If you ever wondering if it was worth it to do something small even if it can't solve the whole situation...this movie will change your mind and heart forever.,1384300800,,234,4.441860465116279
4393777,5,B004K4FUNO,It's always heartening to hear of stories of people doing good for others.  The act of good told here has so many unexpected and wonderful ramifications.  Makes me hopeful to hear and see stories like this one.  The story is well told.  I recommend it highly.,1378080000,,259,4.565217391304348
4393778,3,B004K4FUNO,Quite an interesting movie and I am glad to have purchased it but it is not what I would class as a high class documentary.  There were quite a lot of times when video footage was wasted on uninteresting and unhelpful subject material.  This slowed the plot down.  The worst parts were when the children were waiting for exam results.  Generally the subject matter was interesting.,1373846400,2,381,4.7272727272727275
4393779,4,B004K4FUNO,"I am hoping that this film can help me motivate my students about their education. It is powerful to see in this film that there are children in the world desperate to fight for educational opportunities that some students in the US take for granted. It is even more powerful to watch and consider the resonating power of small acts of kindness on a global scale.

I look forward to making this my go-to-feel-good film for those moments when I could use a little reminder of the seed of goodness in humankind.",1361404800,,509,4.532608695652174
4393780,5,B004K4FUNO,What an inspirational story. Small acts of kindness translate into great moments. We need more people like Chris. A must see film.,1358380800,,130,4.954545454545454

8432394,5,B004K4FUNO,"This is such an amazing documentary displaying many different aspects of Kenya. I'm only a high school student, but recently I visited an orphanage there and while watching this, I saw the kids that forever have a piece of my heart! I'm currently writing a research paper about Kenyan education & this video has been very helpful and totally worth the amount of time (and tears) I set aside to watch it!!",1480550400,,404,4.625

8432397,5,B004K4FUNO,"This is a wonderful story of how sponsoring a child (or any similar small act) can make a big difference in the world.  It's a grounded explanation of the aphorism that ""everything is connected to everything else."" I have read some reviews that point out that the film follows several people, and find that approach a bit 'spread out', because they are looking for a ""clear"" plot.  To me it was beautifully and amazingly clear!  All of the protagonists are connected through their efforts to use and improve the education system in the village where the central character, Chris, comes from. It is a video about education, community, and love. It will teach you things.  It is gracious and inspiring!",1462924800,2,700,4.808333333333334
8432398,5,B004K4FUNO,"This is a must see movie. Yes, it has been around awhile but its message is timeless. We can all change the world with our one small acts. Simple, beautiful message of giving without expectation of reward or recognition. Genuine message with real people - highly recommend this for all ages (older elementary children - through adult).",1462752000,,335,4.894736842105263
8432399,4,B004K4FUNO,"Yes, its a bit schmaltzy and feel just a touch like one of those  you can save a child commercials.  But this film proves you really CAN save a child, and that even small acts by regular folks can make a real difference in the world.

 In this case it was a holocaust survivor, the charming and sweet Hilde Bach, who escaped from Germany to Sweden as a child and grew up to become a school teacher  leaving behind her parents who perished in the camps.  Knowing something of how hard life can be, she joined a Swedish program donating $15 a month to help a child in Africa.  Little did she know that her money was enough to allow that boy to go on to secondary school, and then in turn get a scholarship  to Harvard Law School.  Now he works for the United Nations, heading up a group fighting genocide around the world.

Knowing that he would never have made it to where he is without Hildes kindness, Chris starts his own foundation to help pay for childrens educations in his native Kenya, and also sets out to find the Swedish woman he never met, who made his life, and the life he in turn is offering to the next generation possible.

This is all intercut with following three young students hoping to get one of the education grants provided by Chriss foundation.  But first they have to score high enough on Kenyas version of the SATs, a demanding and daunting test that determines whether or not a child can even go on to secondary school at all, or is doomed to a life of low-paying manual labor or farming.  Knowing there is no way all three can get the award makes it tense, dramatic and sad at times, and there are some unexpected twists along the way.

Ultimately, its a pretty delightful and empowering film.  If its a little rough around the edges on a film-making level, thats more than balanced by how it gives one a little bit of faith and hope in a world that often seems to do all it can to rob us of feeling that we can change things for the better.",1449360000,2,1970,4.286486486486487
8432400,5,B004K4FUNO,I've shown this film to my students for the past 2 school years. It is wonderful at showing kids what life is like in other parts of the world and makes them appreciate what they have...and how the smallest act of kindness can make the biggest difference. :),1437177600,,258,4.395833333333333
