2757147,1,B000N6U0VU,"In seven years of conservative government and culture, one venue I thought would remain unchanged was Masterpiece Theatre.  Since the late 1960's this PBS program has entertained Americans with film renditions of the classics like ""War and Peace"" and popular literature like ""The Forsyte Saga"".  We have had to endure however some very mediocre programming these last years and interminable reruns.  I had great hopes for tonight.  However, the change in the introductory format of this incredible and most popular event should have been the warning to avoid what was coming next.  Gillian Anderson, of X-Files fame, is no Alistair Cooke.  And tonights premiere of a new version of ""Persuasion"" is not persuasive.  Of anything. Frankly, Penry-Jones as the Captain, on leave, of a multi-gun warship is not persuasive.  Sally Hawkins as the girl who turned him down years before is not persuasive. Alice Krige as the overly influential godmother is not persuasive.  This production fails.  Country squires do not have the vast estates, carriages and horses, and retinues of Baronets and Earls as portrayed here.  Virginal ladies of the years between England's wars with Napolean DID NOT play Beethoven on the piano; he was considered most radical at that time and most unsuitable for wellbred and innocent ears. Naval men did not wear civvies all the time during this period.  And candlelight never had the brightness of 100 watt blubs so evident nearly throughout this film.  It is almost as if the producers and directors took their version of Austen's ""Persuasion"" from a Readers Digest abridged edition.  Hawkins is so anemic one wonders what Captain Wentworth ever saw in the girl.  Penry-Jones is so ""soft"", one wonders if this Wentworth could command anything.  Anne Eliot's hypochondriac sister, overplayed here, is so tiresome anyone, including myself, would drown the woman.  The family she has married into in Austen's novel is supposed to be on a lower social scale; being a family of gentleman farmers.  But in this film their home and possessions rival the aristocratic Eliots'.  Bit of an oops there, I think.  As for the bad boy cousin Eliot who has found favor again with his family?  Austen portrays him as an elegant and hanesome if superficial and conniving man.  There was none of that present in the actor chosen for this version.  If this premiere is an example of what we can continue to expect from PBS, thank goodness there are DVD's of better versions of Persuasion and DVD's and VHS tapes of the wonderful dramas and comedys from all the years PBS, Masterpiece Theatre, and Mystery can proud of and nearly all of them can be purchased right here at [...].  Considering that the newer directors and board members of PBS and CPB include people from very culturally rich and diverse backgrounds I am stunned even more at tonight's poor showing.  After all, they do decide what we see.  I thought the days of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" being redone as a moralistic tale of the evils of prostitution and syphillis, first shown on PBS in 2005, and other such interpretive horrors were long gone.  There may be little or no moralizing in tonight's new film of ""Persuasion"".  But, in truth, there was not much of anything to recommend it either, in light especially of two earlier versions either of which are so very much better in every way.",1200182400,25,3358,4.937611408199643
2757148,3,B000N6U0VU,"I was hoping that ITV would take the fine '95 film version, upgrade Captain Wentworth (Ciaran Hind was just too stern and forbidding), which they did well with Rupert Penry-Jones and make Anne a bit more attractive, less mousy and a tiny bit less brow beaten than Amanda Root, which they didn't.  Nobody said that Anne has to be so sad and droopy looking, just a bit ""faded.""  After all, she is almost over the hill at 27. Anthony Head is a perfect preening Sir Walter Elliot, Tobias Menzies is excellently devious as William Elliot and Alice Krige plays Lady Russell as she should be.  And while I'm happy to see any new version of anything Jane Austen, previous reviewer Jenelle Hunter sums it up brilliantly, ""Its like Run Lola Run all over Bath, and hey look, Mrs. Smith isn't crippled, so she can run alongside and explain all the junk about Mr. Elliott. ""  Yes, and then there's that weird kiss at the end.  Oh well, at least we can be sure that this won't be the last dvd adaptation of such a wonderful book.",1200182400,16,1015,4.435483870967742
2757149,2,B000N6U0VU,"I loved the earlier version of Persuasion and was prepared to like this newer version.  After all the BBC re-do of Pride and Prejudice was far superior to the 70s version.  Alas,  it just seemed too rushed and too compacted.  If you didn't know the story or the family dynamics, you won't learn them from this film.  I like the actors, but the screenplay leaves a lot to be desired.
The music is nice.  Even if you are not a Jane Austen purist, see the Amanda Roots version to really enjoy Persuasion.",1200182400,12,501,4.391304347826087
2757150,2,B000N6U0VU,"Presenting a simplified version of a novel widely regarded as a masterpiece of English literature is not a meritless idea: though we understand that especially the development of character may be diminished or compromised, it may be worth it to get the essentials across.  To present a simplified version of a novel which is an out-of-order, jumbled, misshapen, meaningless shadow of the original is a disservice to all who watch it.  It neither helps us understand the infrastructure of the original novel, nor is it a worthwhile piece of art in itself.  This production represents a  total failure of engagement; it's a piece of cotton candy.  Watch the 1995 Amanda Root version, as close to perfection as a filmed version of an Austen novel has gotten so far.

(Will no one ever cast a version of ""Persuasion"" in which the heroine's sister Elizabeth really is beautiful?)",1200182400,132,874,4.9520547945205475
2757151,4,B000N6U0VU,"Of the three new iTV films done as part of the Jane Austen Season this year, this one is my favorite (although it was really a toss-up with Northanger Abbey, this one wins for less content issues):  iTV Britain adapted the following to 90 minute TV films this year: Persuasion, Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey, and this one I think is the best of the bunch.  Although short, this film packs most of the best bits of Jane Austen's `Persuasion', into a 90 minute easy-to-watch (though hardly accurate) period piece, taking this film `to the masses' as intended.

Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot and Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Frederick Wentworth are well cast, doing their parts justice: the others are mostly well cast, with a few exceptions (personally I found Mary Musgrove hard to take, the Musgrove sisters a bit too silly and Elizabeth Elliot a bit too old), and although I like this new adaptation, I think it cannot compare to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was extremely well cast and was just so beautifully done.  This new version is intended to bring Jane Austen to new audiences and I think it does so admirably.  It is beautifully shot and nicely costumed, and there are some very sweet and emotional moments that portray the books good points nicely.  I like the focus that this film has on the type of wife and characters IN a wife that Captain Wentworth is interested in, and how Anne is or isn't fitting into that idea at any given point.

Personally, one of my favorite things about this new `Persuasion' adaptation is the music (when it's there): the score that is part of this piece is very light, but mellow and haunting, sweet and melodious; I would love to purchase this music as a soundtrack CD, but haven't yet seen it available (nor I think, is it likely to be made so)...nonetheless, it is nicely done and worth paying attention to as you watch the film!

Content: there is not much objectionable with this film: there is mild innuendo, polite references to marriages and flirtations, but nothing much to give offense: all in all, a family-friendly film...

Yes, it's not entirely true to the book, yes, it's too short, yes, things have been changed, but the emotional swell created by the top-notch acting of Sally Hawkins, among others, as well as the build of the film and music, I think, pay off in the end: the end is short, too short for me, I will admit...the entire ending is summed into a quick few minutes in which everything is resolved that takes time to resolve in the book, but I still am happy to have this emotional and nicely-filmed version of Persuasion to add to the collection!",1199836800,45,2654,4.641791044776119
2757152,4,B000N6U0VU,"Ok so it wasn't perfect especially the way they did the ending but I loved it anyways. I actually prefer this version to the 95 version because Rupert Penry Jones played wenworth so much better, sally hawkins portrayl of ann was wonderful, and it's a little faster paced than the older version. But they really messed up the ending, and that kiss was repulsive to watch... all that spit...yuck. overall, of all the new itv adaptations, this one is the best. Northanger abbey was cute. Don't even bother with mansfield park, billy piper just ruined it. You'd do better with the 1999 version with Frances occoner.",1199577600,5,611,4.773584905660377
2757153,3,B000N6U0VU,"Ok, just to let you know, I'm just finishing a whole semester focusing on this book, so I feel like a bit of an authority! Anyway, the great thing about this movie, besides Wentworth being so smoking HOT (sorry Ciaran), is its appeal to Austen newbies: it simplifies and reorganizes the story so it makes sense in a screenplay. That said, if you're an Austen purist, this movie is going to kill you!

From the start, the details are rearranged, making me cringe at the lost subtleties from the novel. The very climax of the book, the all important conversation between Anne and Harville and Wentworth's subsequent letter, are broken into separate sections of the movie and completely out of order. Sure it works, but its not right! I felt I was denied one of the greatest scenes of the book! Ugh!

 As for the actors, besides Wentworth being hot (I feel I must reiterate this) he wasn't necessarily better or worse than Ciaran, just a different take. Anne was mixed: one minute I hated her, the next I loved her. She also brought a new aspect to the character and I appreciated it. Everybody else, though, was insignificant. I really felt like the 95 version made even the small characters round and dynamic, and in this movie, if you weren't the hero or heroine you were blah. And whoa...way too much over-emoting.

 And what was said before was true: the end stinks. Its like Run Lola Run all over Bath, and hey look, Mrs. Smith isn't crippled, so she can run alongside and explain all the junk about Mr. Elliott. Nice one guys. Yeah, so my last thought of the movie was that maybe I would at least get to see a satisfying kiss between Anne and Wentworth, and after the slow inching toward each other's face with Anne chomping (literally!) at the bit, it was finally there. So that was nice.

 Ok, in summation, the 95 version is classic and timeless, but if you don't know the story beforehand you're going to get lost. This version is Persuasion for Dummies but it does have a few merits. Its worth watching, whatever your experience, but consider yourselves forewarned!

P.S. If you're hoping the new Mansfield Park is going to be better than the 99 version I think you will be disappointed. I could only stomach a few minutes before I HAD to turn it off. But then again, I kinda liked the 99 version, so who knows.",1197676800,302,2320,4.533492822966507
2757154,4,B000N6U0VU,"""Persuasion"" is tied with ""Pride & Prejudice"" as my top favorite Jane Austen novel. I was looking forward to this version, after being a little disappointed with the 1995 adaptation (actors were a bit too old for their roles, I thought, but that's another review).

While ""Northanger Abbey"" is a story of young love, ""Persuasion"" is a story of love lost.  Anne Eliott was once engaged to Frederick Wentworth but has had to give up the engagement due to the persuasion of her friend Lady Russell. Anne is the daughter of a baronet and Frederick is a young lieutenant with little prospects and was deemed by her friends and family as not worthy enough to marry Anne. Fast forward to 7 or so years later, and Anne's family is in dire circumstances. Her family has to move from their large country estate to Bath in an effort to retrench and avoid further debt.  Frederick returns to England as a wealthy and highly eligible naval captain and his and Anne's paths meet again. Frederick is pursued by 2 of Anne's younger sisters-in-law while Anne is left to wonder what might have been. After a stressful visit to Lyme, Frederick and Anne's paths briefly separate.  Anne moves to Bath where she is pursued by her cousin William Eliott and she crosses paths with Frederick again. Will love triumph the second time around?

Whether you agree or disagree with my assessment of the 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, I think you will find that Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins are wonderful in their roles as Frederick Wentworth and Anne Eliott.  Sally Hawkins - unknown to me until now - gives a soul-stirring and endearing performance as Jane Austen's long suffering heroine.  Rupert Penry-Jones is aptly dashing and handsome, though perhaps a little bland, as Frederick (I'd take him over Ciaran Hinds any day). The supporting cast is solid - with a few exceptions - and the screenplay, up until the last 10 minutes, stays true to the tone and spirit of the book. The production values, costumes and locations are excellent. This scores points for actually filming in Bath and Lyme (actual locations from the book). Another high note is Martin Phipps (who also composed the amazing score of BBC's ""North & South) who delivers yet another stirring score.

The reasons for the 4 stars are as follows (warning, spoilers!):
a) Casting - I absolutely detest Amanda Hale as Mary Musgrove. She is annoying and stands out in a bad way from the rest of the cast. Julia Davis is also off as Elizabeth Eliott and looks more like Anne's wicked stepmom than her older (by 2 years) sister. Elizabeth is supposed to be beautiful and elegant, and Julia Davis is nowhere near this. Surely there are more than enough talented British actresses who could have played these roles.
b) Changes - Some long-time fans will be a little irritated with the changes made to famous scenes from the book. This is where the 1995 version triumphs over this version. While the Amanda Root version remained faithful to the book, this version strayed in some of the vital scenes such as the dialogue between Captain Harville and Anne on woman's constancy; and the scene where Frederick writes a letter to Anne.
c) The last 10 minutes - where Anne runs around Bath like a headless turkey - almost completely ruined it for me. Whoever thought of sending a docile, elegant, poised, upper-class lady like Anne to run around town like a servant girl is beyond me.  The adaptation would have been outstanding except for this miscalculation. I am not a purist, but there is just so much a long-time Jane Austen fan can take and this one crossed the line for me.

All in all, however, I give it 4 stars for Sally, Rupert, most of the supporting cast, Bath, the score and the first 80 minutes.  It goes along swimmingly up until the climax, at which point I have to fast forward to skip the part I detest.  A good and solid adaptation, but ""Northanger Abbey"" starring JJ Feild and Felicity Jones gets my vote as my favorite of the recent Jane Austen adaptations.",1197072000,506,4033,4.704964539007092
2757155,5,B000N6U0VU,"Persuasion is my favorite novel by the astounding Jane Austen.  I loved the older adaptation and wondered how this version would meet my expectations.  I was amazed and entranced with the actors, the script, and the added subtulties the movie provided.  I ended the movie with tears in my eyes.  You will not waste your time with this movie.  I ordered this DVD before it was available in the states and programmed my DVD player to play region 2.  I couldn't wait.  I even pre-ordered the region 1 version so I can watch it on my big screen.",1196812800,20,541,4.459183673469388

2757200,5,B000N6U0VU,"This was such a bittersweet take on my favorite novel. I cried more watching this version than the 1995 version. I've ordered the BBC version of Persuasion from 1971, not to compare, but in hopes of finding a movie that captures the heart and soul of the book.",1520812800,,260,4.4375
2757201,2,B000N6U0VU,"Bleh!!!  I have rarely left such a low score but I found this version of ""Persuasion"" rushed and extremely forgettable.  Rupert Henry-Jones makes quite an impression but his time with Anne is limited and lacks chemistry.  The rest of the cast is not distinct in making an impression.  One aspect is that it is difficult to keep track of which character is which from the standpoint that many of the women have similar hair color as Mrs. Clay and Elizabeth.  Elizabeth comes off as such a shrew more as the evil stepsister in Cinderella and Mrs. Clay could have easily been written out all together for as little screen time she has.  I like the actress Alice Krige but she also fades into the scenery as Lady Russell.  Much is not seen but only mentioned in that the film lacks drive: 1) When Anne's friend reports the true reason of the machinations of her cousin's desire to marry her, it comes off as a side note and not as important as it should be. 2) Visiting with Captain Wentworth's former seamen also comes off as overly long and tedious. 3)The device of Anne speaking to the viewer breaking the fourth wall takes up time and does not impact the overall film.

I highly much prefer the ""Persuasion"" from the 90s starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds as the leads with Susan Fleetwood as a very distinct Lady Russell, Samuel West as the deceiving cousin Mr. Elliot, Sophie Thompson as the ""ailing"" Mary who yearns for attention, and John Woodvine and Fiona Shaw as Capt and Mrs. Croft.

They all make a distinct impression as distinct characters.
I highly recommend the",1520208000,2,1577,4.603571428571429
2757202,4,B000N6U0VU,"I both love and hate this adaptation of Jane Austen's Persuasion.

First what I hate about it:

I also have the old, 1971 (I think) adaptation, with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall, and even though I didn't like it that much as far as casting and costumes, and some other elements, it at least told the whole story. It was incredibly faithful to the novel.

Possibly the biggest problem with this adaptation is that it is far too short. Austen's stories are concise as well as long. They are complex tales that require some time and attention to detail to present properly. This movie didn't go nearly far enough to do that. If I weren't already extremely familiar with the story, I would likely not have understood it at all. There was so much left out, so much under-emphasized, and so much left unsaid. Even the characterization of the two lead characters was weak. I could list everything in great detail, but I'll just say that if you've only seen this movie adaptation and have never read the book, you have no idea what you're missing.

What I loved about it:

For someone already well familiar with the story, this movie presents almost a dream about it. It has that quality, of a dream, and it's beautifully done.  That's exactly how it felt to me, as if I read the novel, feel asleep, and had a beautiful, vague, foggy dream about the story. To me that felt wonderful, and I'm sure I'll enjoy it on my next viewing, because I won't be so shocked at how much is missing. So, thanks for the lovely dream, but to anyone who hasn't read it, please do yourself a favor and also read the book.",1520121600,2,1596,4.448630136986301
2757203,5,B000N6U0VU,"Ive read the book and watched many versions but this one is my favorite. I am a fan of period pieces but prefer those where the actors truly capture their chatacters sentiments.

Do not confuse this with the Columbia Pictures Classics version with Amanda Root. This is the BBC version, and has much more heart and depth.

Most remarkably, the director has her ""breaking the fourth wall"" by looking directly at YOU, the viewer, at the most pivotal moments. Her expression says everything, and pierces your heart.

Although some of the camerawork is awkward and the movie is a little too short, the acting is brilliant and heartfelt. Annes intense-but-restrained emotions may slightly mirror Jane Austens own, and Sally Hawkins really captured this character with subtle detail. While this Wentworth is a bit arrogant and dimwitted (how could he not see Louisas family thought he was interested in her?!) I prefer him because he felt flesh-and-blood. Often Wentworth seems important only because Anne is interested in him, whereas this one seemed to have a life aside from her. Austen movies are frequently mincing or cutesy, as well,  but Persuasion 2007 had characters who were more intense.",1495411200,,847,5.182481751824818

The scenery is very nice, but instead of closeups that show what the characters are feeling we mostly get long shots. It's very difficult to become emotionally attached to any of the characters or actually care what happens to them. Lady Russell hardly comes across as the controlling godmother, Mary is feckless as the ailing sister, the Musgrove sisters are just silly, both of the Misters Elliot are disappointing. The 1995 television production is so far superior in the casting, the direction, the production quality, and framing of the scenes I wonder that the people who have loved this version have obviously never seen the the Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root version. This one is not worth the money. If you wish to purchase a truly superior version of this wonderful Jane Austen classic, get the one with Hinds and Root in the title role.

2757814,4,B000N6U0VU,"Second only to ""Pride and Prejudice"", Persuasion is Jane Austen's best novel!  Difficult not to compare the various adaptations of ""Persuasion"", though; they all have their memorable moments. For me, Rupert Penry-Jones portrayed, to perfection, Cpt. Wentworth. Sally Hawkins was a sweet and gentle Anne. The closing scene, with Cpt. & Mrs. Wentworth in front of the house, redeems the last 10 minutes of the movie. It was a beatifully done adaptation, even though it took liberties with the book. I fast forward over the last few minutes.....the running through the streets and the ""slow-motion"" kiss, with a very uncomfortable close up of Anne in that scene. Why no shot of the Captain looking lovingIy at Anne? I  know Rupert and Sally were taking directions & were doing wonderfully with the script they were given for those last 10 minutes. But neither did justice for what should and could have been a beautiful closing scene with 2 of Austen's most memorable characters..
Even though it was a 27 year old Anne that ran through the streets, maybe in her heart, she was that 18 year old girl who had said ""no"" 9 years earlier and she was not going to lose a second chance at love with her Captain. So, she ran.
And I wonder....if they chose to make Anne so pretty on the DVD cover, why did they not do the same in the movie? Any scenes with Cpt. Wentworth were my favorite because he brought his character, off the pages of the book, to life.",1465689600,8,1446,4.622568093385214

2757869,4,B000N6U0VU,"This newest version of the Jane Austen classic has some poignant moments and strong characters. While I like Rupert Penry-Jones in the role of Captain Wentworth and Sally Hawkins as Anne Eliot. I think the camera work destroys some of the mood. Often Anne will look right at the camera during different moments alone which I found jarring. The ending (small spoiler here) where she runs from place to place didn't strike me as being significant to the story. While it is Anne's story, the moment when they finally come together should be both of their story. The camera is totally on Anne without any expression from Wentworth which I think removes some of the drama and feeling. Otherwise the set and characterization of the movie is interesting and worth watching even though there are other versions that don't contain these few drawbacks. See Ciaran Hinds / Amanda Root version from 1995 and the much older 1971 version have good points as well.",1464048000,3,949,4.828220858895706

All of the cast does such a marvelous job, but I'm convinced that this is definitely the best performance I've seen from Sally Hawkins and she has been in some really fantastic roles. Also, enough praise cannot be given for Martin Phipps' subtle and striking soundtrack. To this day many of the tracks and deliberate silences haunt and provoke me.

2757933,5,B000N6U0VU,I love almost all of Jane Austin's novels adapted to film and have watched (and own) several versions of Persuasion. This is a great one.  I may prefer Hinds over Penry-Jones in certain scenes but all the actors are wonderful and very  sincere. Hawkins and Root versions both cause me to tear up during their soliloquy near the end when it seems apparent all hope is lost and there is a feeling of terrible regret. Alice Krige is wonderful in this one.  Costumes and set dressings are very believable.  To be frank I cannot truly tell if it is worth upgrading from the standard DVD to Blu-ray; there no visible flaws in the DVD itself and lighting/black level/sound etc is fine.

For example, the scene in the Bath concert hall when Anne Elliott is in deep conversation with her cousin William Elliott, which leads to Captain Wentworth's departure, is missing. Also missing is the scene in the Elliot's Bath drawing room when Anne Elliott turns down the proposal of William Elliott. The dialogue in this scene is terrific, and sorely missed in this version. Whatever its flaws, especially the last 10 minutes when Anne Elliott runs all over Bath looking for Captain Wentworth - what Austen heroine would do that - I still like this version.

2757996,5,B000N6U0VU,"This is an amazing, heart-wrenching production, proving that beauty is only skin deep.  My wife and I have been  re-watching all the Jane Austen videos and find this one to be a breed apart.  It not only is the most serious story of the six novels that Jane wrote but probably the most autobiographical and emotional one, as well.  The story is well known to all Jane Austen followers but this rendition adds a lot of pain and remorse that are not dwelled upon in the other videos we've seen.  Except for the final 10 minutes or so, the viewer is immersed in sorrow for poor Anne Elliot as she is used and abused by her father and sisters.  She's treated as little more than a servant by them and taken for granted as the person best fit to do the dirty work.  In this way, sweet, loveable Anne is much like Cinderella with her mean step sisters waiting for the glass slipper and prince charming to save her.  That finally happens, all right, but not after many twists and turns.  One can argue about whether or not this makes sense, but the emotional impact is hard to miss.  We only wish that Anne would have been dolled up more at the end as she is redeemed by Capt. Wentworth and embarks on a new life of hope and prosperity.  She certainly deserves this, with all the folly of a class-conscious society that surrounds her. This production is a short, 93 minutes, but well worth the time for anyone interested in British life in the early-1800's.  For most of us, be very glad you live today.",1457654400,10,1496,4.380434782608695

But when are the British going to give up on trying to make their heroines look homely, unappealing, and almost ugly. They did the same thing in the Ciaran Hinds version. And they write the girl as so meek and insecure, it is extremely difficult to believe that the captain would find ANYTHING at all to be attracted to. The same thing is true with the most recent ""Sense and Sensibility"" and several other recent BBC productions. Would it kill the BBC to put a little bit of blush & mascara on the girl? Make up artists are quite capable of making it look natural. And would it kill the BBC to to cast an actress that is attractive? Sorry to sound mean, but have they run out of pretty girls in the entire United Kingdom?????? We don't need a Kiera Knightly, but for heaven's sake, what's wrong with someone like Daniela Denby-Ashe, who was fabulous in (BBC's) North and South? Or Ramola Garai OR Johdi May in Emma and Daniel Deronda? OR JENNIFER EHLE from 1995's Pride and Predudice?

I love each movie adaptation, but as far as books, I've only read Pride and Prejudice all the way through. When I saw the Hallmark movie, ""Crown for Christmas,"" I just loved Rupert Penry-Jones. When I learned he was in the BBC production of Persuasion, I ordered it. Some of the reviews spoke of differences between the book and this movie adaptation, which, having never read the book, didn't bother me. The ""running through the town"" scene was mentioned in several reviews and I have to admit, it was awkward. I was like, ""When is she going to stop running?"" Then the kiss scene...eek. Anne Elliot was breathing hard (from running) and she had spit connecting her lips. Her mouth kept opening and closing...just strange. It took FOREVER for the two of them to come together in this kiss. Enough is enough, you know? Just do it and get it over with. It was weird to watch.

2758142,5,B000N6U0VU,"I think I own almost every filmed version of every Austen novel.  I find different strengths and weaknesses in all of them, but I would not trash any of them the way people do some versions because they don't stay true enough to the books.  I write books and - were I lucky enough (or good enough) to have any made into a film, I would not be offended if they were changed, even greatly, as long as it wasn't trashed.  Books and movies have different needs and ways of telling a story.  That said, I really love this interpretation of Persuasion.

I greatly appreciate how British productions often don't automatically lunge for the most beautiful or most handsome actors and actresses in their lead roles, as American productions are apt to do.  Sally Hawkins is by no means ugly, but she is almost homely in some of her scenes, such as when she is weeping.  I read a criticism in a review of how the actors stare into the camera, but I think Sally is at her most masterful doing just that, looking right at us, such as in the very first scene, or the weeping scene I just mentioned.  Her facial expression changes are sometimes dramatic and other times subtle but still very effective. I think all of the acting is wonderful here, from the effete snob father right down through to the many minor characters.

I do admit I was a bit mystified by one aspect of the ending.  I will try not to give it away to those who may actually be deciding whether to watch it, but the book's ending is changed for the film, which as I said above, isn't a problem for me in itself. There are enough versions of Austen movies or mini-series out there that I am fine with each doing some interpreting. And in this version, they want to make the final scene more dramatic.  That is fine.  But what struck me as weird was that Anne follows a character out the front door just seconds behind him, but that person is nowhere to be seen on the street, and she goes off in pursuit.  It wouldn't have taken much to have Anne be delayed leaving just long enough to make it realistic that there would be no sign of him when she steps outside.  But I forgive them that oddity. Perhaps it was the result of an editing room dilemma.

The music by Martin Phipps is also wonderful, moody and rich.  I am surprised that the soundtrack was not made available (the last time I checked).  The closest I have come to finding it was, oddly enough, a CD called H2O by the Canadian nature CD producer Dan Gibson.  It is similar to the main theme music of the movie, though obviously not the same thing.",1445904000,2,2564,4.339622641509434
2758143,1,B000N6U0VU,"I understand this is a shortened version to what we've seen in past versions, but right away there was wasted time with no dialogue running through the house.  A few lines of dialogue could have explained the packing up of the house.  The costumes and hairstyles looked more like a 1970's dated version, not as accurate to an early 1800's design.  The ladies all looked heavily made up. I much prefer try 1995 P&P's design of having the actresses not wear any make up, to more accurately portray women at the time.

Sorry, but 1995's version is much superior.  This looked like a bad inaccurate version.  If they needed to make a new version, better to do it right rather than slap together a shortened inferior version.",1445904000,3,720,4.6299212598425195
2758144,5,B000N6U0VU,"Powerful performances and a hauntingly beautiful score easily make this the best adaptation of Jane Austen's Persuasion I've seen.  When I saw Sally Hawkins' name in the opening credits, I knew the caliber of talent and production values were going to be excellent, and they certainly are.  If you've ever felt the grief of losing the one person you knew you were destined to be with, then this film will resonate deeply with you.  I've had that experience and like Anne Eliot, that person unexpectedly re-entered my life after many years, as well.  Sally Hawkins' performance as Anne is heart-wrenchingly true to life.  Her Anne lives on a tightrope, precariously balanced on the tension between resisting the temptation to hope that a future with her lost love could even be remotely possible now and her overwhelming regret for her decision to reject him so many years ago and what can probably never be again.  Rupert Penry-Jones is equally outstanding, guarding a heart that has not mended in eight years, never knowing what to expect from the situation or the woman who inexplicably rejected him so many years ago.  My heart broke for both of them as their powerful performances had me wholly invested in the outcome of their story.  The production is rounded out by a strong supporting ensemble as well, including Murray Head, who does a terrific turn as Anne's conceited, tempestuous father who struggles to maintain his all-important social standing even while his fortune is waning.  Equally as important is the score by Martin Phipps.  I was immediately taken aback by how beautiful it was.  Built around haunting and wistful piano solos, the score provides the atmosphere with a palpable sense of yearning that underscores and accentuates all the performances as if it were its own character.  For me, the Jane Austen by which all other adaptations are judged is the 1995 BBC Pride & Prejudice miniseries with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle  that I consider to be near perfection.  Although Persuasion is a different kind of story and doesn't have the budget or six hours of film that Pride & Prejudice had to take you on its journey, it's amazing what it accomplishes in just 1.5 hours.  With the ideal cast, director, writer and composer, it's near perfection itself.  Highly recommended.",1444953600,2,2301,4.953125

The screen play relies on our knowledge of the text not only to locate ourselves in Jane Austen' s story, but so we can fill in the void of unknowing when nothing is verbally expressed. The music of restless dreams slides into tingling awareness when AE, nearly grounded into dust by grief, disparately trying to out run it, alerts the viewer. The illogical medical attributes, and the queasy ending at Kellynch, (after so much sweet suffering, blind-folded on her wedding trip? No thank you, Sir!), were difficult to get by. After seeing it a few times, I was able to sort it out for myself, and began to enjoy the work. ""Captial"", as Capt Harvell and Sir William Lucas would say.

2758206,3,B000N6U0VU,"If you're an Austin purist - or even if you're fond of the book - this is probably not going to be the adaptation for you. While it's probable that the same lines are used as in the '95 adaptation, they're spoken by different characters, and in different order. It drove me mad!

The things I liked:
- The reordered and reassigned dialogue emphasizes the close relationship between Wentworth and Harville.
- The actors are younger.
- The Musgroves, Mary excepted, are generally more likable than the '95 adaptation.
- Louisa and Henrietta Musgrove are portrayed as the sweet, unaffected young ladies they're supposed to be.
- Captain Wentworth is handsome enough to merit the attention he receives on that account.
- Prettier locations (obviously, a subjective assessment).

Things I didn't like:
- The reordered dialogue now comes across as exposition, robbing the story of much of its suspense.
- Anne (and Mrs Smith!) running all over Bath.
- Frederic and Anne leave Camden Court at approximately the same time, Anne at a dead run, and Frederick stops off to write a long letter along the way, but she still takes FOREVER to catch him.
- The Crofts seemed a lot less affable than they were in the '95 adaptation.
- Mary Musgrove snivelled through every scene in which she appeared, and at times seemed genuinely unhinged.
- Anne's jaw hung slack through the entire movie. I spent the entire time fighting the urge to say ""Close your mouth, Anne!""
- Anne was supposed to be meek and malleable in her youth. She was supposed to have matured into a steady, quietly confident woman. She seemed way too timid.
- I was disappointed that they changed the surprised reunion of Frederick and Anne in Bath by telling her about it beforehand.
- Mr Elliot's reserve at the recital (not asking Anne to translate the Italian, generally giving her space, and not behaving like a possessive dolt) makes Frederick's abrupt departure seem like ugly, jealous rage.",1438041600,2,1948,4.811940298507463

The first time I watched this movie, I was so overcome with sadness because I just knew Captain Wentworth had stopped loving her. However, this movie has given me hope that true love never dies and that the universe always has a bigger plan for us even when all hope seems lost. I can't wait until my nieces or perhaps my own daughter(s) are old enough so that I can watch this movie with them and talk about the beauty of love ever so innocently while we lie in our pajamas and feast on tasty treats!

2758260,2,B000N6U0VU,"The main character in this classic story, Anne, is miscast and poorly directed.  She looks and acts like an awkward, menial servant girl instead of the elegant, aristocratic, although disappointed, young woman she is in the book.  The actress's habit of allowing her mouth to hang loose and open in response to nearly everything that happens or is said to her becomes annoying very soon.  The open mouth schtick (in tight close-up) is used to convey panting passion in the final scene which consists of a fumbling, slushy kiss.  Laughable and totally out of whack for any authentic depiction of a Jane Austen story.  The version with Amanda Root is far, far superior.",1433203200,,667,4.867256637168142

2758295,4,B000N6U0VU,"We liked it, but we didn't love it.  Sorry.  We were disappointed and I think Jane Austen would be, too.  I would like to ask the casting director why he chose Sally Hawkins to play Anne Elliot.  We hesitate to use the word 'inadequate' for her acting, but it did leave something to be desired.  She did try, but perhaps she had poor directing, or maybe she misunderstood the character.  All of the actors conveyed a feeling of 'being rushed' as they attempted to act their parts.  They all lacked depth and believability, in our opinion. The word ""Shallow"" comes to mind.  Rupert Penry-Jones who played Frederick Wentworth, did a lot of 'posing', as if to say, ""Hey, I'm a handsome guy, why do I need to be an actor, too?""  We felt cheated after watching Persuasion.  It was as if the actors didn't take it seriously, so how were we supposed to?",1431043200,3,846,4.470588235294118

That simply isn't the way Jane Austin wrote the book.  Ann does feel that pain and anxiety, but she is a very pragmatic and sensible creature that while wishing things were different would still carry on.

2758338,4,B000N6U0VU,"What can I say? Love these two, Sally and Rupert, but the sickly sister (Amanda Hale) made me want to smack her, and I'm not a violent person. I found her mannerisms annoying. I've since seen her similar behavior in other parts and it seems to be her way. She is tolerable I suppose, but not tolerable enough to tempt me. Thankfully, we see little enough of it here and Rupert Penry-Jones helps the scenery fly by with ease making her forgettable. Sally Hawkins is great but the kiss ... you will see what I mean ... get on with it. Too much delay in trying to create suspense and it just falls flat because of it. Worth a look, but really wish they had done another take on the kiss. I don't want to be examining her uvula and the effectiveness of her teeth whitener while waiting for the moment. Not my idea of suspense. That said, it's in my Jane collection and gets a viewing now and then. The elder sister seemed more wife material for ""father"" than a daughter, but I overlooked it. They call it suspension of disbelief, don't they? It is required here. I think there is 11 years actual difference between the actors. Wish they would cast these films more accurately to the characters' ages. (ie Emma Thompson in S&S) However, I dropped a star for the kiss alone.",1428105600,,1268,4.4

We didn't know this until we were unable to watch a second disc received from Amazon, which we had to return as we did the first disc. Finally, we ordered a non-Blu-ray disc and it worked with no problem and we enjoyed that disc so much we have already watched it three times. This is a period piece based on Jane Austen's novel that takes place near the end of the Napoleanic wars. What is remarkable about it is not just the attention to details of manners and dress, but primarily the subtle portrayals of the various characters in a story about hurt feelings, wounded pride, hopes long lost gradually rekindled and re-dampened with a resolution that only comes in the film's very last moments.

He is petulant and ignores her through the first half of the movie, cozying up to Louisa and then when he sees her with her cousin Elliott, pouts like a child.  Was he worth running the Victorian marathon for?  Well, his letter is quite romantic and well written and, as others have said, Rupert Penry-Jones is a ""hottie!""",1422403200,,511,4.655555555555556

Sally Hawkins and that totally hunky Rupert Penry-Jones create so much restrained passion and devotion.  Sure wish PBS or Masterpiece would work them into Downton Abbey.  He is just gorgeous.

2758538,2,B000N6U0VU,"Out of all Jane Austen's novels, ""Persuasion"" is probably the hardest one to adapt -- especially since Anne Elliott is a quiet, understated heroine.

So it's not much of a surprise that the 2007 adaptation of ""Persuasion"" is... well, a bellyflop. The story is strangely pallid and colorless, without any moments of actual passion or intensity -- and despite being simplified and streamlined for Austen noobs, it feels very rushed. And it's hard to tell if the limp, weepy depiction of Anne is due to the direction or actress Sally Hawkins.

Eight years ago, Anne Elliott (Hawkins) was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth (Rupert Penry-Jones), but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell (Alice Krige). Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter (Anthony Stewart Head)  is facing financial ruin.

So Lady Russell convinces Sir Walter to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.

And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her concerns clash with her shallow father and sister. Furthermore, her father's entailed heir William (Tobias Menzies) recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.

""Persuasion"" feels like it was directed by a depressed person -- everything is filmed in a wobbly, pallid way that makes me think of a Regency-era found footage movie. There's no sense of passion here, except for the all-too-frequent scenes where Anne goes to her room to blubber over Frederick seemingly being in love with someone else. When people are injured, or angry, or happy... there's just a sense of grey flatness, underscored by slow violins.

Admittedly it's not a bad way to be introduced to the plot of ""Persuasion,"" especially since the scenery is breathtakingly pretty in the pale light -- the beaches, the forests, the rambling stone houses. The story is rather simplified here... but it still feels rushed. For instance, Mrs. Smith randomly pops up on the street to breathlessly blurt out exposition to Anne, even though Anne supposedly visited her earlier in the movie. It feels overstuffed and stripped-down at the same time.

And the climax is unintentionally absurd. First Anne goes on a wild ""Run Lola Run"" sprint through Bath twice (which, in Regency dress, looks completely silly). Then she has the world's least sexy kissing scene with Wentworth, where she keeps opening and closing her mouth pre-kiss -- it's like watching a hungry fish trying to reach a hook.

I'll give Hawkins and Penry-Jones credit -- they do pretty well with their characters, although Penry-Jones looks a bit pale to be a professional sailor. Unfortunately, Anne is... kind of spineless and gormless here. She cries a lot, and never shows even a flicker of spirit where Wentworth is concerned -- it's hard to see why a strong sea-captain would be attracted to her. And the movie wastes Krige and Stewart-Head, neither of whom get to do much -- she flutters around anxiously, and he fusses. That's it.

But I'm... simply mesmerized by Amanda Hale's performance. It is possibly the most bizarre performance I have ever seen in a movie -- her Mary honestly comes across as mentally disabled sometimes. It just left me wondering... whose idea was that?

""Persuasion"" is a decent introduction to Jane Austen's story if you've never read the book or seen any other adaptation... but for those familiar with Austen's works, this rushed, joyless version will fail to persuade.",1402617600,2,3892,5.056162246489859

Because, this movie, 'Persuasion,' checks all of my romance, love, and story-line buttons.  'Persuasion' holds my attention as it leads me through a 'love affair' between a man, and a woman who really do not initially get the opportunity to fully realize there dreams to be together forever, due to the time, and customs of the same in which they live.  What's more fascinating about this movie, is... just when you think you may be turned-off by these facts that this man and woman face regarding their relationship; or, lack-of; the strong story-line holds this movie together extremely well as it tells you a story of 'true' love, endurance, and 'persuasion!'

2758571,2,B000N6U0VU,"This is the WORST adaptation I've ever seen of an Austen book ( and I have seen a lot ), but I did find myself enjoying it - for the wrong reasons. It was so ridiculous and far fetched I just had to lough, and by the end of the movie my husband and I  were laughing so hard we almost fell out of bed. And also The actor who plays Capt. Wentworth is so very hot.

Persuasion is Austen's last novel, publishes after her death in 1817. It tells the story of Anne Eliott, A heroine not so young or beautiful any more. At the age of 27, Anne is considered, by that time standards, to be an old spinster  (remember, Elizabeth Bennet from ""pride and prejudice"" was 19 and her sister Lydia Eloped at the tender age of 15 !!!!). Having lost her youth and beauty and with no prospects of ever marrying , Anne is quietly resigned to spending the rest of her life taking care of her self centered father and sisters. Though They are unappreciative of her, and often mistreat her, Anne is  a strong  person  and manages to live her life with dignity and courage.  Her quiet existence is completely shaken by a the return of Capt. Wentworth, whom she turned down 9 years ago, following advice from her friend, who thought he was not socially and financially suitable.  Now that Wentworth is a naval officer who has returned from the war with fortune,  he's successful, wealthy and considered a very suitable match, and is sought after by every young eligible woman in sight.
Anne finds herself in the dangerous situation where hopes and dreams she thought are long gone and forgotten awaken in her, but Capt. Wentworth is unforgiving and cold. As the story unfolds we discover that Wentworth's coldness is just a front to disguise the hurt he still carries from being turned down by Anne, and that he could not forget her.

 So much for the novel - and on to the adaptation: The script, the casting, the acting, everything was so off. Nothing made sense and nothing was there to support the narrative of the romance between Wentworth and Anne. The production's hair stylist and costume designer should have won an Oscar if there was an Oscar for  ""most unattractive and unflattering costume"" and ""The ugliest hair style in recorded history"" for their treatment of poor Anne. You can see that a lot of effort was put into turning the actress, Sally Hawkins, from an attractive young woman to a person past her prime who pays no attention to herself. But no effort is evident on the side of the script writers to provide us with even a clue as to why Wentworth would fall in love with her in the first place, and why he would love her still, after all the hurt she caused him. In the ( MUCH BETTER ) 1995 BBC adaptation of Persuasion&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persuasion-HD/dp/B00AEUPOVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persuasion [HD</a>] we see how loyal, kind, and loving Anne is.  We see how she takes care of everyone in her family ( though they are ungrateful and unworthy of her ) how she quietly and efficiently runs her father's household, takes care of her hypochondriac and spoiled sister and does it all with a smile, and we understand why others, including Wentworth, would hold her in high esteem.
But here - the writers simply cut everything out, we are left with a woman in ugly clothes and and oily hair who is also dull, uninteresting and has the personality of a door mat. It seems that she spends most of her time whimpering and pathetically crying into her diary.  Now this woman had dumped the most handsome and dashing officer in the whole wide British navy because he had no money.
9 years later he shows up, still dashing but now also wealthy. She regrets dumping him, well -DUH, but why would HE even give her a second look?

Smoking Wentworth stirs a lot of excitement among all the unmarried woman and  they all compete for his attention.  This is when it started to be so bad I had to laugh - on a stroll one of wenthworth's Admirers, Louisa, is flirting with Wentworth and is jumping into his arms calling ""catch me"" ,until he fails to catch her and she falls and suffers a severe head injury. This bit is indeed in the book -  but when you see how it plays out in the movie it's simply hilarious. Instead of being a tragic mishap , you watch how Louisa simply hurls herself down from a great height and you wonder if the head injury was there BEFORE she fell.

Everyone is worried about Louisa and the accident accept for Wentworth: on a conversation with a friend he is surprised to find out he was courting Louisa. I should think their flirting should have tipped him off. He reveals that he  did not intend to propose to her as everyone thinks, and now he is more worried about people's expectations , rather than for her recovery. You get the notion that he  regrets she survived her idiotic accident, because if she lives he's obliged  to marry her, if he wants to or not  -  how comic.  The friend advices him to put some distance between himself and poor brain damaged Louisa, and he accepts in order to diminish any thoughts about marriage.
He confesses he still loves Anne - which would be a huge shock if we did not read the novel, because up until this point he did not seem to notice her existence ( and who would blame him ).  Ciaran Hinds played Wentworth so beautifully in the previous adaptation: he gave a very nuanced and convincing performance so you can tell he still cares deeply for Anne while he is PRETENDING not to notice her. She had hurt his feelings and his pride and he is working hard to suppress his love. Here Rupert Penry Jones as Wentworth simply goes from totally ignoring her and flirting with another woman to dumping the other woman in her hour of need because he's  supposedly madly in love with Anne.  Totally unbelievable. I can't even understand how people who have not read the novel or seen the other adaptation are supposed to understand what the hell is going on. Everything is so hasty and inexplicable.

The script carries on to be even more rushed and unconvincing from now on, so much of the plot and the conversations was edited out. If it hadn't been for the comic moments this movie provided, I would have turned it off by now.  It's a good thing I didn't  - because the most comical moment of all is still yet to come - the scene in which Anne is running all over Bath trying to find Wentworth. Beside the fact that running around in the streets was a behaviour  that was totally unbecoming of a lady and poor Austen would have stabbed the directors and writers had she been alive to see her heroine disgraced so, Anne is clearly in a very bad shape. By the time she finds him she is breathing heavily and panting and you half expect her to drop down dead. Despite  his confessed  undying love for her, Wentworth seems to be detached and unimpressed with her effort to find him. You would expect him to take her in his arms, or at least bring her a glass of water, but he seems mostly put off, Perhaps because she is too sweaty after her long jog . Their first kiss is weird, I guess they were going for a shy, hesitant kiss, as PDA were frowned upon back then, but again Wentworth gives the vibe like he is NOT so interested in kissing her, and that he would have preferred to wait until she showered first.",1400112000,4,7321,4.4879518072289155

2758576,5,B000N6U0VU,"When Joe Wright created his adaptation of Pride and Prejudice he set off a bit of a revolution in film-making at the ol' BBC. Why can't Jane Austen be just as theatrical and cinematic as a great work of film art? While they are undeniably classic books, why not release something that uses visuals and music to tell a different kind of story, one with deep emotional undercurrents to go along with the lovely dialog? As a answer to those questions we got quite a few fantastic adaptations, from Emma to Northanger Abbey, but this one is my favorite.

An Understated but Powerful Romance

The main character of this film reminds me very much of a friend of mine. Shy, quiet, selfless, genuine, and caring, her wants and needs, to say nothing of her feelings and desires, are buried deep down. She made a mistake years ago, and is tortured by the thought that she may have thrown away her only chance at real and complete happiness. For the romantic who knows feelings of pining and longing, this story is the food of the gods.

The two leads are pretty much perfect in their roles, being compelling, understated, and deeply likable. You accept them both as the sort of people you would want for friends. Not for the person they are on the outside, but for the qualities they quietly wear and display with no bragging or fanfare (but which very much come to the attention of others).

A sumptuous feast for the senses

I'm not normally one for the overcast dark palette of England, but here it is perfection. Not brooding or gothic, it comes across with a wonderful warmth of color that pulls you in. Not a sunny picture, to be sure, but beautifully, cinematically shot, with a haunting piano score that makes the heart ache with anticipation at the promise of loss restored. This isn't a story that is particularly long or that features particularly eye-popping scenery, but the film definitely makes the most of locations, editing, and scoring to take you on a lovely trip.

I can't hear your criticism over the sound of my heart bursting

Some people take issue with various aspects of this film. Particularly with the ending. Too modern? Too emotional? If Kenneth Branagh can take artistic liberties with Shakespeare to produce a great film, then I have ZERO issues with our shy, mousy heroine running as fast as her feet will carry her and getting lost in a rapturous moment of fulfilled longing when she finally agrees to marry and kisses her true love. It's called wish fulfillment people, and it's what makes life worth living. Inappropriate for the era? Sure. Wildly emotional? No doubt. And satisfying? Endlessly. Perfect. One of my favorite moments in any romantic film ever. Awesome. And highly recommended to the hopeless romantic.",1398643200,4,2742,4.7478991596638656

2758578,1,B000N6U0VU,"I am a Jane Austen fan, but I would not call myself a purist. I understand that film and books are different media, and thus sometimes there needs to be some creative changes when adapting a novel into film. An overview of what was GOOD about this film:

1. The Cast: Way better than the 1995 adaptation in my opinion. They actually looked the right age, and fit what I think most people imagine when thinking of Ann Elliot and Frederick Wentworth.

2. The Costumes: Not so fancy and elaborate as to elicit doubt as to their authenticity. I thought they were appropriate.

3. The Scenery: Some interesting shots of some beautiful places in England were there.

4. Accurate: Up until the last 10-20 minutes, the diversions from the original story were not that big of a deal (i.e. that Mrs. Clay's husband died instead of whatever shameful thing happened in the book).

Why it SUCKED:

1. Directing: Holy Shake Cam, Batman. So annoying. It got awfully old fast. And WAYYY too many head on shots. I think the director was trying to be artistic, but it came off as amateur and stupid.

2. Diary-writing: Please, if you are going to rip off the Mansfield Park adaptation from 1999 with her writing, go long or go home. The occasional entries into her diary with terribly close ups were just strange and felt out of place.

3. The last 10 Minutes: OH. MY. GOODNESS. This is one of the sweetest moments in all of Austen's writings, and it is RUINED by the completely asinine scene where Ann is RUNNING through Bath. Not just running, but panting in front of a shake cam. For 5 minutes. She must fine Frederick! Where could he be? Essentially she runs all the way to the Crofts only to find out he is back where she started at Camden Place. And then, after the drawn-out, awkward, and painful to watch running scene, we see them kiss. But first she has to decide if she is going to eat him or kiss him. Mouth open, leaning in. For 30 seconds. I swear it seemed like an eternity. WTF.

If you want to see a rushed, thrown together version of Persuasion, this is your film. If you want to see an adaptation that truly brings the novel to life, despite its too-old cast, watch the 1995 version with Ciaran Hinds.",1398297600,2,2202,4.45771144278607

2758589,2,B000N6U0VU,"I must admit that I have not read this book, though I have read others by Austen. And I have enjoyed film adaptations of her work. I expected--and found--familiar trappings: the anxiety and fussing about being an old maid and marrying well, leavened with emotions and moments that are human and believable, even viewed from the context of today's world.

But this rendering baffled me. Sitting around a big table of friends and acquaintances, sharing a meal and talking, our heroine falls into a rather heartfelt, intimate conversation with a young man who is widowed. Why, they are practically friends and equals. And yet--hello?--men hold so much power above women in this world. She's still got to wait and wish and hope that a man will bestow a marriage proposal on her. Gawd. I guess a young woman had the freedom to say yes or no when that shining moment arrived, but let's be honest, sometimes she could not follow her heart and plenty of other people are usually minding her business.

Her godmother probably gave her bad advice years before, poor dear Anne. Is that because her godmother is from an older, more conservative generation, or is the bad advice particular to the person who gave it? Perhaps the book sheds more light on this subplot and its dynamic.

To have Anne get the man she longs for AND recover the house in the end was like a fairy tale. Oh, we had a similar ending in Pride & Predjudice, but it disappointed me both times, frankly. At best, not necessary, at worst, it begs belief. Why do true love and financial security have to be on the same plane?, is my gripe here. Or in Jane Austen's world, is financial security the reason for marrying and true love the frosting on the cake? Sigh.

Last but not least: the friend who lent this to me praised the chemistry between the two leads. She was right; they had it. That was fun enough! (Though the much-awaited snog was painfully protracted.)",1394323200,,1922,4.627565982404692

There are several good actors--I like Sally Hawkins performance--she portrays the poignancy of Anne Elliot's position so well--and Rupert Penry-Jones also portryas Capt. Wentworth with a great touch of pride struggling with love he still carries for Anne.  All the supporting actors are excellent.

I compare this favorably with the Ciaran Hinds/Amand Root version.  The only  I did not like is that this film doesn't include the priceless scene where Wentworth pens his passionate letter and secretly passes it to Anne all while in the company of un-noticing family & friends --this should not be left out, even in the interest of meeting the time constraints of a movie.

I don't know why the BBC even tried to do versions of these stories in only about 100 minutes - it cannot be done!  Even so I did like this version of Persuasion.  I thought these characters were more 'real' than in many previous versions, especially Anne Elliot.  I think the story is easier to follow in this version compared to other shortened versions.

Among its other faults, the portrayals of the two main characters was way off.  Penry-Jones may be hot, but I found him lukewarm and unbelieveable as Wentworth. As for Sally Hawkins, she looked like a half-wit, when she wasn't looking like a total schlump.  Give me Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds any day.

There were many things I didn't care for in the prior version but at least I felt they did a decent job of casting. Someone screwed up here. Mr. Wentworth isn't that bad and actually as it went on I didn't mind him so much when compared to the tediousness of watching Anne. What was with the open mouth throughout the whole entire film? I only gave it two stars because i did see where this could have been a great adaptation.

I bought the version with Ciaran Hinds because I loved The Mayor of Casterbridge so much. The 2008 version of Persuasion is much more charismatic. I also enjoy Alice Krige as an actress so that was a bonus.,1384905600,,317,4.389830508474576
2758662,5,B000N6U0VU,One of my personal favourite version of  Persuasion . I think Rupert Penry -jones was absolutely perfect in this role. Sally Hawkins was very believable in her role too . Very enjoyable but I must say the the main characters did it for me.,1384819200,,239,4.431818181818182
2758663,4,B000N6U0VU,"The best thing about this version is Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Wentworth. While a tad too good looking and smooth faced for a naval captain that fought in a ruthless war, for the most part he does a credible job of portraying Wentworth.

The worst thing about this movie is that either the screenwriter or the director have taken undue liberties with the plot. I found RPJ and SH's acting to be good, but unfortunately they had the deck stacked against them by the terrible script and/or the terrible directing.

The most egregious offense as far as I'm concerned is changing Anne from dignified, resigned and intelligent to mousy, inarticulate and ever-weeping. This new version of the heroine really makes you wonder why Captain Wentworth was ever interested in her and how can he continue to be so? All the intelligent conversations that Anne holds with Benwick and other characters in the book (and the 1995 adaptation) are cut out, giving the viewer absolutely no clue as to her personality and charms. Benwick, which is a fairly important character in the book, is given a grand total of 3 minutes screen time.

Anne's expected bloom in the second half of the movie is simply never seen. She continues on mousy and washed out, with her mouth perpetually agape and trembling, weeping from beginning to end. I have to blame this one on the director. It is not bad acting but it is not in keeping with the Anne Elliot conceived by Austen. Meanwhile, even changing her hairstyle or giving her slighly prettier outfits would have helped create the impression that her reacquaintance with Wentworth is filling her with renewed hope and optimism, and that she is transformed by her love for him.

The ending reeks of Harlequin, not only due to Anne's utterly inappropriate rendition of ""Run Lola, Run"" in 19th century Bath, but also because key parts of the plot have disappeared. When does Wentworth find the time to write her that letter since she chases after him right after elucidating the question of Mr. Elliot? When did he even have time to go back to Harville's and drop it off? And why didn't he just give it to her himself, since thay had just chatted?

And the constancy conversation, the one that prompts his declaration....it was butchered. Cut down to a couple of sentences between Benwick (during the only scene he is even seen) and Anne, as opposed to Harville and Anne, and completely outside of Wentworth's earshot.

Other oddities: Mrs. Croft and Elizabeth look way older than 38 and 29 respectively, Mary seems borderline manic, Charles Musgrove sounds foolish, Mrs. Smith is not disabled, Henrietta is barely shown and Captain Wentworth is surprised to realize he was courting Louisa. I have to dwell on this for a moment because, my reading of the book indicates that to a certain degree he did it to get back at Anne for her rejection, hence the ""unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant"" part of his letter.

If you can forget about the novel, you can classify it as a well acted romantic costume drama with great visuals and a somewhat wimpy heroine. But it is not Jane Austen's Persuasion. Not by a long shot.",1384646400,2,3175,4.740942028985507
2758664,1,B000N6U0VU,"That was just bad! From the very first scene you can tell something is not right. We get no introduction of characters. Who is Ann and who is her family? All of the other characters were just there to exist. We don't get any background stories to relate to.

Why alter events? this is a classic novel, why change them? Eliminate main scenes and famous lines?
And for the life of me I can't understand why some of the female characters were cast so old: The actress playing Elizabeth looked rather 40, though she is supposed to be only 29. Mrs Croft is 38, yet the actress was well beyond 50.
And why Mary appeared to have an IQ of 25?

The only positive not is that captain Wentworth is handsome.

If you have't read the book or seen previous version I wouldn't recommend this to you, you will be scratching you head wondering what and why and who.

Dare I say the 1971 version is superior to this one.

2758746,2,B000N6U0VU,"And this one is not to mine.

Persuasion is such a beautiful book, and the 1995 adaptation so true to it in spirit, mood, rhythm and plot, that it was hard to imagine why we needed another. But of course there will always be another Austen adaptation - we have Pride and Prejudices, Emmas and Sense and Sensibilities coming out our ears.  And in another 5 or 10 years we'll have a new round, with the next generation of young actors.  So be it - Shakespeare never gets old either.

This adaptation has all the right costumes, locations (ah Lyme, ah Bath) and superficial manners (we bow our heads politely) but that's about it. To compress the plot into 90 minutes much was left out, rearranged, or invented. Instead of the exquisite scene where Wentworth overhears Anne speaking to Harville, she tells him directly that she's not engaged to Mr. Elliot, and then (as so many have already said) chases him all around Bath.

Rupert Penry-Jones may be a good actor, but here he's just used for his chiseled, if bland, good looks. He has two facial expressions: pained, and 'in-love'. We don't see Wentworth's humor and good spirits, his intelligence, or even much of the rapport between him and Anne as it reestablishes itself over the course of the story.

Hawkins - just, no. Her mouth quivers and gapes, she weeps, she staggers and sighs - this is not Anne Elliot, this is not any Austen heroine. It's a stereotypical bereft maiden. The final kissing scenes were so dreadful I had to literally turn away from the screen.

The other characters are stereotypes too, with no nuance. Elizabeth is screechy, Sir Walter is shouty, Mrs. Clay is simpery, Mary is whiny, Benwick is gloomy, and so on - everyone has one broadly drawn characteristic.

Just one woman's opinion. (And to decide if your tastes align with mine so you can decide whether or not to take my review as guidance or with a grain of salt: Love both the 1995 and 2005 P&Ps but ADORE Matthew MacFadyen; Favorite Emma is the 2009 with Jonny Lee Miller, love Sense and Sensibility '95, and unlike almost everyone, I love Mansfield Park '99 - I think it's beautiful.)",1374624000,,2124,4.63031914893617

It's way too short so they had to cut out huge chunks of the story, plus a lot of places where they did have scenes that  were from the book they took them and changed them up so much they were almost unrecognizable!! What the heck is up with all the running at the end? Ann chases Wentworth all over Bath, running full speed for what seemed like hours. And oh, that kiss when she catches him!! That horrible, awkward kiss.",1374451200,,545,4.29126213592233
2758748,1,B000N6U0VU,"I just had the misfortune to watch this abominable adaptation of Austen's elegiac, lovely, last completed novel (she was working on 'Sanditon' when she died, 'Persuasion' was published after she was gone). This version is so bad, I found myself yelling at my television for other than political reasons.

Jane Austen wrote two endings to this novel, the one in the book, and the one she rejected; yet this latter was used in this awful TV movie: why the heck would any writer insult another by re-introducing something the initial author found unacceptable? This version is an insult to the lively, ironic spirit of Jane Austen, and is almost unrecognizable as anything she could have written. NONE of the characters here are in any way similar to what she wrote: Anne should be lovely, clear headed, yet enduring; Mary should be a clingy, spoiled, hypochondriac snob; Elizabeth should be an elegant, beautiful, cold snob; Sir Walter should be a vain, empty-headed, handsome snob; and Lady Russel should be a kindly, older, busy-body snob; (note the commonality here). Among the others, Mrs. Smith - who should be an incapacitated, yet lively and optimistic friend and whose rather minor role is of critical importance to the plot - is totally wrong here (her legs were so bad she couldn't walk, yet she is seen jogging along with Anne), and Mrs. Clay should be obvious (to everyone but Elizabeth and Sir Walter) in her scheming to marry Sir Walter, yet here, she's a nonentity. Jane Austen NEVER wrote superfluous characters, yet most of those in this thing are trotted out just because they were named in the book - their roles are eviscerated, their impact is eliminated, and their portrayal, ludicrous. Then there is Captain Wentworth: he is the hero of the novel, he is supposed to still care for Anne but still be hurt from her breaking off their engagement eight years prior, (because of Lady Russel's 'Persuasion' but I doubt anyone watching got the connection between this act and the title, unless they read the book that is). He is also supposed to be a man of decisive action who spent years at sea, chasing down enemies. As portrayed here, he couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag, but he is awfully pretty and awfully soulful, and awfully wrong for this role. Actually, no one in the cast is right for the role played, but that fact has been covered over and over in previous reviews.

The only way I can see that anyone can have liked this movie is if they had no knowledge of the Austen novel. This is a Victorian, almost gothic, romance, scripted by someone who had no knowledge of the morals, laws, and behavior of either the late Georgian (the period of the actual novel) or the Victorian age.  I wasn't thrilled with the Amanda Root version, but in comparison to this pitiable attempt - that one is superb.",1373932800,5,2830,4.7131313131313135

2758766,3,B000N6U0VU,"Before watching this movie, I had previously read the book and watched the 1995 version. So I'll compare both to this.

I liked Anne better in this than the 1995, but not by much; Sally Hawkins is perhaps a little nicer to look at, and doesn't bug her eyes as much as Amanda Root, but still is a little too flustered all the time.

Neither films' Capt. Wentworth were really great, neither seemed to quite fit the character.

No one can beat Sophie Thompson's Mary, you can't even compare the two performances.

Anne's elder sister Elizabeth is supposed to be beautiful; she's not in this film. 1995's Elizabeth is somewhat better.

Charles Musgrove, Sir Elliot, and Mr. Elliot are adequate, though I prefer Charles in the 1995 better.

The set and costumes are fresher in this adaptation, though occasionally Anne's dress's are a little too shabby. One the whole, both sets and costumes are better in this version.

The music is beautiful, and goes well with the film's overall tone. Martin Phipps did a wonderful job.

It's impossible to review an adaptation of a book without commenting on the faithfulness to the novel; that said, I must have a word about the four major scenes that strayed.  First, Anne's conversation with Capt. Harville on the faithfulness of men and women which originally is at the close of the novel and prompts Capt. Wentworth to write his letter to Anne; in the movie, it is moved to earlier in the film, and is between Anne and Capt. Benwick.  They would have done better to leave the sequence alone, as their meddling with it did not improve the story.  The second and worse stray is when Anne, after receiving Wentworth's letter, finds it necessary to run like a flustered hen about Bath in search of the author.  That scene is a negative on two accounts: first, it is NOT in the book. Second, it is highly unlikely that a woman of high status and in that era would ever do anything so undignified. The third and fourth unlikely scenes are 1) Anne and Capt. Wentworth's kiss, which was in my opinion gross, and a thing that they would NOT have done in the middle of a busy street, and 2) Capt. Wentworth's buying Kellynch Hall; also unlikely, and also not in the book.

To  close, this movie may be more appealing, have an attractive cast, and a good pace, but if you want faithfulness to the book, go for the 1995 version. Though slow, and not attractive to all, it is very faithful to the book, and will appeal to Austen/Persuasion purists more than this.",1372032000,2,2489,4.589164785553048
2758767,4,B000N6U0VU,"Right up front I'll admit that I enjoyed the 1995 BBC/Sony Pictures version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds over this 2007 re-boot.  It was eleven minutes longer, I and definitely liked the '95 version's ending over the 2007 version.  I think Ms. Austen may be doing some flips/rolls in her grave if she was aware of the ""liberties"" the scriptwriter took with the source material: how her heroine was made to run all over Bath trying to catch up with Capt. Wentworth, how the minor character Mrs. Smith was not portrayed as an invalid as she is in the book - and how she and her Nurse Rook, provided Anne with much needed information as in other versions; Anne and Frederick waltzing on the lawn outside Kellynch Hall ... come on!  But the locations, sets and costumes don't cause any complaints from me.  Yes, I agree with another reviewer who thought the actress cast as Elizabeth was a bit old, and sister Mary's portrayer conveyed just the right amount of whiney, unlovable and unpleasant characteristics that came through on the page.

But the real reason, besides the ones I mentioned above, that I made this purchase was to see Rupert Penry-Jones - he justifies the expense!",1370822400,,1187,4.714975845410628
2758768,5,B000N6U0VU,It was a wonderful addition to my Persuasion Collection.  The story is the same but the beginning and ending are really well done. This Ann Elliott character was most believable and you felt some compassion for her and a little anger at Lady Russell who seems to always be around.  She is moderation on two feet while her father and sister Elizabeth are the excess and extravagance in their lives at Kellynch Hall.  How many of us would not take every advantage of renewing a true love if it proved to be available once more. In this case the silence was golden.  This movie is well done and the scenery at the ocean was spectacular.  I guarantee that it will be an oft-watched movie in your collection.,1370131200,4,703,4.503937007874016
2758769,3,B000N6U0VU,"This film is not terrible but if you have the option of watching the 1995 version, which is vastly superior, I would not waste time on this one. There are a couple places here where the camera shakes so much I had to look away. Why the filmmakers choose to depart from the novel and from historical accuracy in certain ways I shall never know: Captain Harville hands Wentworth's note to Ann (this would never happen as an unmarried man could not write to an unmarried woman he was not engaged to); Ann runs all over Bath (most unladylike behavior); Ann runs out of the concert and after Captain Wentworth; the setting of many exchanges was changed but for no apparent reason. The actor who plays Mr. Elliot is forced and Ann's reactions whenever Captain Wentworth's name is brought up would lead anyone to see that she is pining for him--ridiculous as she would want to hide this. Also, the chemistry that exists in the 1995 version between Ann and Wentworth is lacking here. The last 10 minutes are cringe-worthy and eye-roll inducing: It takes them forever to kiss, Ann's mouth seems full of saliva, then the camera twirls around and around. Oh, brother. One good part of the film: the actors who plays Wentworth and the Crofts (though I still prefer the ones from the 1995 version)--they just needed a different script, director and co-stars.",1369612800,,1345,4.703389830508475

2758771,3,B000N6U0VU,"I'm a romantic and love the story of Persuasion.  Have studied the book and written reports for school on it. I have seen several versions of the story with my favorite one starring Amanda Root.  This most recent version in no way compares to the earlier one. Yes, the actors may be better looking but that's about it for the positives.  It doesn't develop the story.  It changes the ending in several ways.  I understand that this is often done to make the story more exciting - this however did not accomplish this - it just was ridiculous!

UPDATE: I must comment on the positives of this version to be fair:
I love the way the main character has several scenes throughout the movie where she is alone and looking directly at the camera and displays several different emotions depending on the scene - great effect.  Also I really enjoyed both actresses portrayal of Anne and her sister Mary in BOTH this version and the Amanda Root version.",1367971200,3,944,4.583333333333333

2758773,4,B000N6U0VU,"I liked this version better than the 1995 version.  I watched this one soon after watching the other version and noticed immediately that this one has a more serious feel to it.  Through the camera work, lighting, music, and probably through the way the actors set their moods also, the director emphasized that Anne missing her chance at being happy was serious; that it had dominated her life for years and that it always would.  The movie communicated her overwhelming sadness very well.  In one early scene showing Anne writing a letter where we hear the narration of it, for example, she looks directly at the camera for several seconds so as to say, ""so you see what this is like and what it has meant to me?  You understand?""  The movie forces you to realize how heartbreaking it would be for Anne to have missed her chance and to have never forgotten the guy, and to see how long that feeling had gone on.  This work early on sets up the viewer to sense the joy of what happened later more fully.
And I liked the scene at the end with her running through the streets.  Not realizing that it wasn't in the book, since I haven't read it, I was free to enjoy it.  The scene says that she knew absolutely what she wanted now and wasn't going to be persuaded differently again, and that she was now willing to break any and all rules of propriety for the sake of grabbing hold of love.  She wasn't going to miss it again for anything.  Also, as a male I can say that I'd be much more likely to be crazy about this Anne than the other one.",1365724800,,1541,4.29757785467128
2758774,5,B000N6U0VU,"This version doesn't follow Austen's book to the T.  They have also taken on some liberties of their own. But isn't that the thing for films to do?  Every adaption, opinion, and writing is not the same, nor should it be.  This version has it's own ""individual stamp"" on it.  I have read the book about six years ago, so I am rusty.  But I read this book more than Austen's others.

I bought the '95 version on iTunes a few years ago.  That version may have been verbatim to the book, but it just made the story dull and boring.  I saw the movie three times and it was not a charm (twice with iTunes and once on Amazon).  I was very disappointed that I deleted the download.  I didn't believe that Hinds and Root were in love with each other and the pacing of the film was very slow.

This 2007 version was a nice change.  The acting was believable.  I really liked Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins as a couple.  Sally isn't model gorgeous but real.  She is who I imagined when I read the book.  She looks ""homely"" with a faint past existence of possessing beauty.  Rupert is now my forth favorite Austen hero actor (Colin Firth, Jeremy Northam and Johnny Lee Miller my first three faves).

I liked this version the most.  The characters were a lot more likeable and believable.  The pacing of the movie ran smoothly and wasn't boring.  And the photography was perfect.",1365724800,,1372,4.386454183266932

2758787,5,B000N6U0VU,"this is not the first film adaptation of this novel but i believe it is the best.  what was done was to rev up the romance so that it could finally hold its own with PRIDE & PREJUDICE. The first thing it did right was to finally get a leading man who would make our hearts beat faster.  oh, yes rupert penry-jones certainly did that. i've seen him on other UK shows like the criminal WHITECHAPEL and the spy based MI5. but it is this film which gives him romantic gravitas.  if you were a fan of Colin Firth as Darcy, you are about to become a fan of Penry-Jones as Wentworth. i think every single jane austen novel has needed a romantically persuasive leading man for its film adaptation to work.  this is not to say that the female is unimportant as this adaptation also has the best actress doing the role.  but my belief is that the critical casting job has to be the leading man.  if he doesn't set our hearts aflutter, forget the whole project.

Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root did an earlier version. Hinds as Wentworth did not set my heart aflutter at all.  I liked him much better playing a bill clinton like ex president with sigourney weaver in the Hillary like role on american tv.  root was just too plain and mousey as the heroine.  sally hawkins here as anne elliott is a lot more convincing as a woman wentworth might pursue.

next, austen excels at these comedic minor roles. these are expertly done in this adaptation.  there is the heroine's father, who is a complete snob who has done nothing with his life other than to inherit a title.  his self regard is hilarious.next most comic is the hero's naval friend who reads doomed romantic poetry constantly due to his intended's recent death. his long, mournful walks out on the rocks over the spewing sea, apparently all but ready to throw himself into the drink, ultimately become comic as well. there is also the heroine's sister who at least is a hypochondriac or maybe a forerunner of munchauser's syndrome.

this adaptation takes some artistic license with things like the heroine running through the street and such. i do not mind these rather minor flourishes being added in the movie version.  true, they could not have really happened during the Regency but I personally do not watch Jane Austen film adaptations as historical documentaries.

if you miss this version of PERSUASION, really, it is too bad of you if you are an Austen fan.

In that context, it's a bit of shock to watch this newer version because the casting is so different and, for the most part, inferior. That is, except for the two lead roles. Penry-Jones puts in an excellent performance throughout. But Sally Hawkin's performance is just breathtaking; she carries the whole movie to something much better than what we have a right to expect from these production values. Indeed, this is one of those rare instances in film when an actress gives a performance so riveting that it's hard to see how she or anyone else could have improved upon it. Bravo.

In looking over these reviews, I see there are two camps on the screenplay and its departure from the original novel. I personally think we're better off encouraging screewriters to liven up the orignal material, at least to a certain extent. This version certainly does that to great advantage, and I like the different emphasis put on Penry-Jones dillemma with the Musgrove girl. A truly excellent film!",1360713600,2,1077,4.853260869565218

Hawkins just isn't very unattractive and her appearance doesn't change from start to finish, although Austen describes a gradual enhancement of Anne's looks as the story progresses, a return to something more like her former ""bloom.""  The reason that irritates me is that it would be so easy to make happen, with subtle changes in hairstyle and makeup.

Overall, I think I like the Amanda Root version better than this one, although I agree with other reviewers' comments about much of the cast in that one looking too old for their parts.  This version does mix up a lot of the conversations, making them out of sequence, or changing who says what, and it doesn't add anything at all to the story.

I'm still waiting for just the right movie version of this fabulous story.",1359331200,,964,4.680473372781065
2758824,5,B000N6U0VU,"Many viewers, this one included, will be comparing this film to the 1995 Amanda Root version, which has long been one of my favorites among the Austen films. And the earlier version is more faithful to the novel, which, like all the Jane Austens, tends to be stiff and emotionally dry. This newer adaptation rises above those limitations and brings the drama to life. Sally Hawkins delivers a blow-away preformance as the late twenties spinster torn between a bad decision she's pressured to live with and the passionate love she still feels. The director (Shergold) must have realized early on what he had in terms of Sally's transcendent abilities for this role. It's hard to believe the original screenplay is the one we see. It's easy to imagine Shergold responding to the early rushes by revising his film plan and sending the writers back to work. If that's what happened--and we can only speculate--then we need to be grateful that he did. The directing is obviously tailored in a special way to Sally's exquisitely emotional portrayal.

Much criticism in these reviews has been aimed at the climactic running scene. Purists complain that it is not in the book and contrary to Regency norms. But every filmmaker should try to improve upon the original book. Would anyone really want him to do less? This filmaker clearly succeeds in improving upon the Austen novel. That the running scene mildly breaks with social norms is the very point of it. This is a woman who, at last, is being given a second chance, and it turbocharges her actions to grasping the opportunity she never thought she'd have. Her turbulent, action-oriented closing on triumph satisfies in a way the novels never do. It is the running scene that catapults this adaptation to one of the best love stories ever committed to film. I'd give this movie six stars if I could.",1359072000,3,1847,4.826498422712934

2758876,4,B000N6U0VU,"Several years ago, Anne Elliot (Sally Hawkins) received a proposal of marriage from young naval officer Frederick Wentworth (Rupert Penry-Jones).  With very little to offer Anne in the way of money or property, she was persuaded by her family members and closest confidante, Lady Russell, to turn Frederick down.  Now, eight years later, Frederick has returned a rich man with half of the women in the county falling at his feet - and Anne has lived to bitterly regret her decision.

Jane Austen's final-completed novel, PERSUASION, is one of her most mature and pragmatic works.  She cleverly plays with the pre-established pattern of her earlier stories by having the characters already in complete possession of their feelings for one another. In ""Persuasion"", the love story has already taken place but failed, and the challenge now is how to bring the lovers back together again.

The BBC's 1995 film of ""Persuasion"" (starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds) is a great favourite for many (although I've never completely warmed to it), but this latest 2007 attempt - originally part of a new season of Jane Austen adaptations for ITV - gives a refreshing new interpretation on the story.  I appreciate the efforts of Simon Burke of trying to give the character of Anne something of a backbone (this is especially evident in the final scene where Anne runs through the streets of Bath after having read Frederick's letter).

Sally Hawkins is fast-establishing herself as one of the new ""go-to"" leading ladies of British period drama (after ""Fingersmith"" and ""Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky"").  Her Anne is a delightful creature, very sympathetic but also with a great deal of comedy.  I adored the casual scenes between Anne and Wentworth - and Rupert Penry-Jones gives Ciaran Hinds a good run for his money in the handsome and dashing stakes.

The performances are strong right down the line - producers went for some very interesting casting choices, including comedienne Julia Davis (""Nighty Night"") and Amanda Hale as Anne's sisters Elizabeth and Mary; Anthony Head (""Merlin"") as Sir Walter Elliot, Alice Krige as Lady Russell; and Stella Gonet (""The House of Eliott"") as Mrs Musgrove.",1345334400,,2198,5.080555555555556

2758880,1,B000N6U0VU,"This adaptation of Jane Austen's brilliant story is laughably bad. The acting is quite the worst I've seen in a very long time--I'm not entirely sure what Amanda Hale was attempting in her portrayal of Mary Musgrove, but the character ended up coming across as very weird and possibly demented. Sally Hawkins was perhaps more attractive than Amanda Root's Anne Elliot, but seemed to think gasping and a perpetually slack mouth constitutes a good performance.

Rupert Penry-Jones gave me a glimmer of hope in his performance, but any acting skill he possesses was forced into the background by a truly terrible script. If the writer and director actually read Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"" (of which I am not convinced), I'm quite curious why they felt the events of the story needed to be cut up and rearranged.

The conversation Anne has with Harville in the book, regarding the constancy of women, instead takes place between Anne and Benwick, outside Wentworth's hearing--which is rather extraordinary, since Wentworth's overhearing of that conversation is what prompts his declaration of love. It is all finished off by a very unladylike and period-inappropriate sprint through Bath (complete with enough shaky cam to suit any extreme sports filmmaker), and one of the worst on-screen kisses I have ever seen.

I can't think of a single redeeming thing to say about this film, and forcing myself to finish it was nothing short of torture.",1338336000,7,1439,5.088983050847458

2758883,3,B000N6U0VU,"Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins are both very admirable in their roles. However, I cannot give this production more stars because of the overly fast pace of the plot. I felt that the story short-changes the emotional drama and suspense experienced by Anne's character and thereby strips it of dramatic tension. Why were the filmmakers in such a hurry?? I believe they largely wasted the cast in this manner. Both leads are more than capable of developing more profound characterizations with more time.

I concur with the objections of others near the end, where Anne runs around Bath in an undignified fashion. It tells us that she really means business this time, but what does it tell us about Wentworth? Is he so lily-livered that he will not come back to check on Anne? I vastly prefer the confidence she shows us in the 1990s version with Root and Hinds, where she waits expectantly for his return. This earlier version of the ending also demonstrates more of the intellectual and emotional bonds the two characters so easily share.

In some ways I prefer Rupert Penry-Jones' interpretation partially because I believe Ciaran Hinds seems too mature for the actual age of Wentworth.

Another reason I prefer the 1990s version is that the pacing at times feels somehow very realistic to me, with a quietness that actually puts the viewer into the time period and lets him/her share the experience, rather than merely watching it. Anne's experience of frustration and anxiety are more deeply sensed by the audience by allowing the events to occur as they happen in the novel.

All in all, this newer version is not unwatchable, but it is rushed and superficial.",1333152000,2,1669,4.886925795053004

2758898,5,B000N6U0VU,"I have seen three different versions of Persuasion in DVD: the BBC one dated 1971 and very theatrical, the one dated 1995 with Amanda Root and Ciarn Hinds and the late Corin Redgrave and finally the one from 2007 with Sally Hawkins and the gorgeous Rupert Penry-Jones.

The one from 1971 does follow Jane Austen book Persuasion very well, but it can become a little boring and because it is a very theatrical version, the actors are not as attractive as in the other versions, plus they have a terrible teeth problem (thank God that the young generation of European actors, in general, take better care of their teeth).

The one from 1995 is the one where you see that the actors chosen are perfect for the roles they are playing, starting with Amanda and Ciarn and without forgetting the late Corin Redgrave as Sir Elliot (the best Sir Elliot I have seen), the Elliot sisters, the Musgroves, Lady Russell (the late Susan Fleetwood) and Mrs. Croft. Ciarn plays a more mature and cynical Captain Wentworth than Rupert Penry-Jones in the 2007 version.

About the 2007 all I can say is: Rupert Penry-Jones. The cast is good, especially Sally and Rupert playing a more caring Captain Wentworth, and I'm sure they are playing their characters as the director wants them to play them, but Mary Elliot is unbearable! It is a very free version of the Jane Austen book and although the end is a little crazy, just to see the change on Rupert's face and especially those gorgeous blue eyes when he is asking Sally Hawkins if the rumors of her marrying her cousin are true, is worth the price of buying the DVD. What a face and eyes!

2758902,5,B000N6U0VU,"I loved this movie. This is coming from someone who has yet to read this novel. I've only read Pride and Prejudice so I'm not a complete newbie. What I do think this movie has going for it is great casting, and a very streamlined story. I'm sure this novel had so much more to put in. And if it was going to be a miniseries like the fabulous Pride and Prejudice in the 90s, then they could fit all the details in. But because this was a 90 min movie, they had to chop some stuff.

I found the Anne such a likable character. She has flaws, but is mostly a great heroine. I also loved the character of Wentworth. I think he was played very well, from someone new to this material.

The tone of the movie was great. I loved all the outdoor, cloudy scenes. And I especially loved the water. Such a great use of setting to get the tone just right. I also loved when Anne would stare into the camera. It was always jarring, but she had such wonderful expression that it really touched me.

As always, I loved the costumes and everyone seemed really in character for the time.

My only complaint would be the sometimes odd use of the shaky cam. I liked it when it was used for example with Anne and Wentworth's sister and brother-in-law (already forgot their names...). At this moment, it was a perfect time to show the absolute torment Anne was feeling with the use of shaky cam.

Otherwise, I adored this movie, especially as a newbie to this material.",1325635200,3,1447,4.285714285714286
2758903,4,B000N6U0VU,"This movie--like every film adaptation of an Austen novel--has its positive and negative qualities, but overall I enjoyed it immensely. Let me start by saying that I teach Austen's works at the collegiate level. I have read, researched, and taught every one of her novels and have seen almost every film adaptation (even the obscure ones) of her work. Each director and actor brings to Austen's work his/her own interpretation of the story and its characters. Each reader has his/her own vision of how that story and those characters should look. It's no wonder, then, that the reviews on this film are so varied.  So please indulge me while I offer my take on this 2007 version and address some of the issues and concerns others have voiced.

Of course, good casting is a key element in bringing Austen's characters to life, and unfortunately the casting quality here is a bit varied.  As for the central character, I actually prefer Sally Hawkins' portrayal of Anne to the other actresses I've seen--including (dare I say it?) Amanda Root (gasp!).  Some critics here claim Hawkins seems like a wimpy, emotional wreck. I disagree. We cannot ascribe 21st century qualities to a 19th century character.  In her novel, Austen clearly describes Anne as attractive (though past her bloom), intelligent, refined (but not stuffy), and feeling a profound sense of duty, responsibility, and loss. I think Hawkins captures this much better than Root who appears more like a dowdy, flat, 30-something governness than a romantic heroine. Hawkins displays the restraint and propriety of a character struggling to keep her turbulent emotions in check while being the sole voice of reason and sense in a group of colorfully clueless yutzes. Yes, her emotional outburst at the end is overwrought, but that is the fault of the director, not the actress. However, I did enjoy the director's ploy to have Hawkins look directly into the camera at certain crucial moments in the action.  While this may be disconcerting to some viewers, I find it offers us a sense of intimacy and connection to Anne and her story. Hawkins' subtle, soulful glances at the viewer provide a lovely window into Anne's heartbreak and mixed emotions. In her eyes we share her pain, anguish, embarrassment, hope, and joy.
As Hawkins' co-star, Rupert Penry-Jones is a handsome leading man who is actually more age-appropriate than Ciaran Hinds who was pushing 50 in the '95 version. RPJ's acting could use a bit more depth and complexity, but his subtlety shouldn't be confused with being flat, as some have suggested. His eyes are quite expressive if you watch him carefully. Anthony Head is perfect as Sir Walter and brilliantly captures his ridiculous,snobbish vanity. Tobias Menzies does an admirable job skating the thin like between charm and sleeze to play cousin Wm Elliot.

Other casting choices are not so great. The Elliot sisters are ill-cast.  At 40, Julia Davis is too old to play the 29-year-old Elizabeth although she captures her personality well.  Mary's character is appropriately annoying but Amanda Hale portrays her with such odd affectation as to make her a distraction. Admiral and Mrs. Croft are delightful characters, but Marion Bailey (60-ish)is too old to be believable as Wentworth's sister. The Musgrove girls are unremarkable, but I must say it is nice to see Nicholas Farrell appear as the senior Mr. Musgrove.

Casting aside,the story is generally well told, although decidedly NOT an accurate rendering of Austen's plotline. Some conversations are rearranged in different timelines and with different characters, but it doesn't affect the film's overall sense of story. Yes, the famous drawing room/letter-writing scene is tragically and inexplicably removed here. In its place is a clumsily-contrived mechanism that finds Anne clutching Wentworth's sadly-abbreviated letter and sprinting crazily through the streets of Bath in breathless, fevered pursuit of him. Those last scenes are the major failing of this film. I understand that Anne is experiencing a flood of pent-up emotion here, but nothing in the novel or the film would indicate her abandoning all sense of 19th century propriety and decorum to publicly race after a man who can apparently move at lightning-stealth speed. It is a total departure from her character. I agree with other reviewers that the ending is rushed. I can only offer that this was done to accommodate a 90-minute run time. A miniseries version would perhaps allow more plot complexities. Oh well. The prolonged, final kiss between Anne and Wentworth bothers some people but not me. Yes, public kissing violates Victorian social codes, but come on-- this is a movie. I can accept the kiss much more than Anne's 5K marathon through the streets of Bath. Perhaps the kiss was a tad overwrought and icky, but as an earlier critic pointed out, it was tentative, anxious, and messy--just like real life. I did find it odd that so much attention was given to Anne in that scene while Wentworth just seemed like a faceless, static set of lips waiting to be smooched. And the last scene of Wentworth presenting Kellynch Hall to Anne as a wedding gift was touching but blatantly implausible. Do we seriously believe that Sir Walter and Wm Elliot will give up their family estate? Even with his fortune, Wentworth could never have afforded that purchase. I'm not sure what that scene hoped to accomplish, but the film should have ended with the kiss. Still, I admit that I was touched by the two waltzing on the lawn at Kellynch in absolute bliss.

So overall, it you are an Austen purist, this version of her last novel will frustrate you. However, if you are like me and can appreciate all the different interpretations and productions of a beloved classic, I think you will enjoy this film despite some of its major flaws. I own all the versions of this film, but this is the one I repeatedly watch. Even with its hits and misses, in the end the film conveys exactly what Austen intended: a sharp social commentary, a poignant portrayal of recaptured lost love, and an inspirational tale of faith, hope, and second chances.",1325548800,5,6140,4.992179863147605

The ending comes too quickly, it feels as though they are rushing to tie up the story...maybe that is because of all the running she does through Bath at the end.  The sister Mary is over played, as others have mentioned, but in some ways I find this humorous...she is the sister you truly want to role your eyes at and say OMG!

I wish that woman were still around to write more tales of gripping romances to taunt the women of today with what no longer exists courtesy of men being more pig like than previous years, but the cinematography was almost enough to make me turn this movie off in the first 15 minutes, i am sotrry but it looks as if it were filmed by high school students and not good ones either the amateur fades and the poor/exxagerated lighting in the movie made it difficult for me to watch however i loved the casting for all but Mary who i really just wanted to shoot in the face she was so ANNOYING but then again the character in and of herself is rather annoying so maybe she should be applauded for her performance (i cant help but wonder who jane austen based the character of mary as well as the character of mrs. bennett in pride and prejudice off of, she must have been one hell of a nagging woman with all the ""nerves"" and ""illness"" how long does it take you to recover from a cold woman) back on point though captain wentworth was by far one of my favorite castings of all jane austen movies i have seen yet closely followed by mr. darcy from the 2007 version with keira knightley. I think Anne deserved an award for this movie she played her role magnificently and really made you feel the frustration of the character and how troublesome it was for a woman desperate to speak her mind in a society so oppressive to the thoughts and actions of women. I would recommend this movie if you can get past the cheesy cinematography and anne running around with her head cut off at the end.",1321833600,2,1662,4.347266881028939

The only version that comes close to this one is the BBC/Masterpiece version from the 70's or 80's (not sure when it was filmed).  The 2007 version was believable and had the right amount of emotion, not overacted.  As for it being close to the book, I have yet to see a movie based on a book that was exactly like the book.

Persuasion was the second J.A. book I read and I've always been very fond of it. I also accept that no movie or TV adaptation will truly live up to my expectations. However, this one was particularly disappointing. Anne was portrayed in a meek, miserable manner which really irritated me since she's supposed to be quietly strong and moral. The rest of the Elliot family was so unimpressive I can't actually comment about them (I hardly even remember them). I did like that they quoted the book since Austen's narrative is both insightful and witty.

In this one - the haircuts are contemporary, the acting is moderately good but not memorable. Missing in this interpretation is the sense of stifling lack of privacy, the tension and the constant monitoring by family and others that keeps the pair from really communicating clearly.

It's not as good a story as the book nor as good as the previous versions of the film. One of my favorite parts of the story is where Captain Wentworth writes out the letter while overhearing a conversation and unable to actually talk with Anne - and with a subtle motion, calls her attention to the note he has hidden - and her reaction.

Sally Hawkins plays the part she is given fairly well, although Anne's ""rebloom"" is not written into the script and I have no idea who directed her to look into the camera so many times. Rupert Penry Jones is dreamy enough that it is no wonder why every girl in the county falls for him, and he has a great acting moment when he watches Anne play Beethovan. Mary, the hypochondriac is pretty funny.

However, the last ten minutes and the proposal were botched wretchedly. I'm not cannon-obsessed like some fans, but what were they thinking by having Anne run all over Bath trying to catch Cpt. Wentworth who is so fast that he can apparently fly? The proposal too, was meant to be written while Anne is saying that women love longest. It doesn't make as much sense out of context. Oh, and the kiss... that was bad. I have never seen a less romantic kiss. Her saliva is all over the place and he looks like he really, really does not want to finish the scene.

2758945,1,B000N6U0VU,"Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel and just one of my favorite books of all-time. The 1995 version is one of my favorite movies. When I heard about the new ITV version coming out in 2007, I had really high hopes and couldn't wait to see another spin on the story. And then it came out and I watched it and...let's just say, I was not impressed.

I wanted to like it. I really did. I just watched this for the third time for the review. I was hoping that I would find more to like with each rewatch but unfortunately they had the opposite effect. I just found more things that I hated! What do I hate? Just the script, the cast, and the direction. So yeah, um...pretty much everything. Was there anything I liked about it? Well, the music was nice and the cinematography was pretty (aside from the overuse of shaky cam). And a couple of the side characters were well-acted. Hmm...that's about it!

The adaptation suffers first of all from being too short. It just feels so truncated and rushed and so many of my favorite bits from the book were left out or just ruined. It didn't seem like the creators cared about the story at all. With only a couple exceptions, I hated the cast. I don't know if the actors or the writing or directing are to blame, but the performances left a lot to be desired. Everything just felt off. I tried not to compare it too much to the 1995 version and even though I couldn't help but do that at some points, I just hate this version on its own. Whatever you do, don't accuse me of disliking it only because of the 1995 version. While it certainly pales in comparison to that version, my hate stems from this just being a poor adaptation of the book, and a poor movie in itself.

It had such potential but it was all wasted. In some parts it seemed like they were copying 1995, and in others it was as if they were trying too hard to be different. I just don't understand. I would actually rank this in my bottom five Austen adaptations, sadly. Even the 1971 version, dull as it was, was better than this.",1304294400,6,2043,4.287564766839378

2758969,5,B000N6U0VU,"It's been a while since I watched this TV adaptation of Jane Austen's last (and maybe more personal) novel, ""Persuasion"".
And I watched it last night, I fell in love with it all over again!

First of all, the story is absolutely breathtaking. Jane Austen wrote it when she was dying, so the novel became a kind of race against time. But the style is really fantastic. The story is about 2 people , Anne Elliot and Captain Frederick Wentworth, who unexpectedly meet again after being separated for eight years. Eight years ago, Anne and Wentworth fell deeply in love with each other (""there were no two hearts so open"") but as Wentworth had no money and nothing to recommand himself, Anne's father and Lady Russel, Anne's deceased mother's friend, persuaded Anne to refuse his proposal, on account of Anne being too young and of Wentworth being pennyless.
The story starts in this adaptation when Captain Wentworth successfully returns to the country from the war, having made a fortune in the Navy, with the intention of living peacefully and of finding a wife. They meet again unexpectedly when Anne's father, a heavy spender has to let the family house, Kellynch Hall, to the Crofts who happen to be closely related to Wentworth.
Anne has never forgotten Wenworth and although she has received other proposals from elligible men, she is still unmarried at the age of 27 and still regrets having refused to marry Wentworth. He, on the other hand, shows he has never forgiven Anne and looks determined not to renew any kinds of relations with her...
For me, this adaptation beautifully recreates this wonderful love story! Even if you are not convinced by the performances of some actors, the mere presence of the two leading actors, Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks) and Sally Hawkins (newcomer)is enough to make you fall for this new version. They are simply fantastic. Sally Hawkins is perfect to me as Anne Elliot! I like the idea that we are in Anne's head and all the film is based on her point of view. I think the director and the producers have managed to keep the spirit of the book as we can have a glimpse of Anne's inner world and share her pain, her hopes and what she thinks of the people around her. Sally Hawkins has a very mesmerizing voice. It is impossible not to feel moved by her in some way. The camera revolves around her and seems to reinforce her solitude and her sadness. It also shows people from her point of view which might be disconcerting the first time we see the film as there are many close-ups of the actors. With Rupert Penry Jones, SH forms a very good-looking pair. There is such a chemistry between them that every scene with them is a delight for me.
Rupert Penry Jones just takes my breath away. He embodies Captain Wentworth to the perfection. I know he looks young for the part but even in the book, it is mentioned that while Anne has lost her bloom, he hasn't changed much all these years. I don't how to explain it but every time he enters a room, he is utterly dashing, I can't help saying to myself 'God, he has so much class!'His big, blue eyes staring at Anne with cold anger are enough to make me shiver with delight. Another reviewer, Mim (I think), said that Wentworth was aware of Anne both in and out of her actual presence. And I agree with that. Rupert's acting gives me the impression that even when she 's not present, he can't help thinking about her. Even when there are many people around them, they are so ""aware"" of each other that you  can't help feeling the bond between them. The two of them are so good together that it's mesmerinzing to watch their scenes.
The music is lovely, haunting and adds to the solitude of the heroine. The landscapes are worth noticing, of course.
Yet, I admit that this TV film still has some flaws, mainly with the script. There is some nonsense in some lines (Louisa and Wentworth talking about Anne and Charles Musgrove) and two or three dialogues, especially the one with Anne saying that women love the longest, aren't placed at the right time. The ending feels too rushed, and although I actually enjoy the race scene and see the symbolism of that scene, the scenes or shall I say -moments- when Anne goes / runs after Wentworth are really too fast-paced!
It also took me a long time to appreciate the performance of the other actors. But the more I watch this TV film, the more I enjoy the presence of all the actors.
Despite these flaws, it is definitely a 'must see'. Just don't stop at one viewing. Even after three or four viewings, I realize that there are still many little details (about the symbolic of some scenes) that escaped my notice before. This adaptation is a romantic film for all generations! And maybe the two leading actors can entice you to read the novel or re-read it.",1300406400,3,4790,4.568604651162791
2758970,5,B000N6U0VU,"I'll gladly stipulate to the objections expressed in many of these reviews that are based on a knowledge of either Jane Austen or the historical period about which she wrote.  I possess neither.  But I have to take exception to the scorn heaped on the scene where Anne runs through Bath.  All of the criticism seems to stem from the same notion - that no ""proper lady"" of the time would do such a thing.  But that's exactly why it has such power.  To suddenly find yourself presented with the fleeting opportunity to undo the single most wrong-headed mistake you've ever made would make most ""unthinkable"" behavior not just plausible but dramatically logical.  Played out against a perfect musical passage and Rupert Penry-Jones's caress of a voice, her abandoning of what's proper makes perfect sense and is my favorite scene in the film.  Along with The Long Kiss, it struck me as completely right in light of what came before.  Also, no one hates giggly camera work more than I do, but here it's limited mostly to the opening sequence where it serves well the storyline of a household being torn apart by financial ruin.  All in all, I really enjoyed this film.  Fine performances all around and an unobtrusively solid musical score were the highlights for me.",1299715200,8,1263,4.752293577981652
2758971,3,B000N6U0VU,"I just finished watching Persuasion for the second time. I was very disappointed as I had read the book and enjoyed it so much. The actress playing Anne was so unappealing, I realize that she was supposed to be the plain younger sister but I found it hard to believe that any man would pine for so many years for a woman so unappealing, she seemed to float around in a daze. I know she was supposed to be broken hearted but she seemed drugged or dim-witted rather than love struck.  That kiss when she had the mouth full of mucous was disgusting and I give the actor playing Wentworth a lot of credit for being able to kiss her without gagging. The other actors in the movie saved it from being a complete disaster and the scenery was beautiful but the lead actress was a very poor choice IMHO.",1299369600,2,794,4.293333333333333

Actually, outside of the story line, my main enjoyment of the movie was Rupert Penry-Jones--he has such beautiful, expressive eyes--the rest of him isn't bad either. I, unlike most reviewers did not mind Ann running through the streets--if I had waited 8 years for a man I loved and then thought I was going to lose him again, you better believe I would have run through the streets too--convention or no. As for the kiss at the end, I thought that the slow motion only added to the anticipitation,my only regret is that the kiss could have lasted longer.",1299283200,2,771,4.475177304964539
2758973,3,B000N6U0VU,"Marcy Gomez, who gave this production four stars, lists some flaws very well. However, I'll point out the additional problems that made me rank this lower (perhaps even closer to two stars).

(1) I found it jarring that the actress stared into the camera constantly. I suppose they were trying to do something artistic, showing us inside her soul and all that. However, I groaned in prophetic anticipation whenever she did this (which was very predictable).
(2) I found her fluttery trembling kiss at the end laughable. Was she a butterfly? Was this the reason she always stood with her mouth half open?
(3) I won't comment on Sally Hawkins' ability to act. However, I don't like her Anne. I think this has partly to do with the interpretation that this production takes and partly with the actress.
  (a) This production seems to make Anne weaker than she really is (or as I imagine her to be). For example, she makes a side comment to Lady Russell passively aggressively blaming her for the past, but then says she doesn't blame her friend. When she misses dinner with Wentworth to watch over her nephew, Anne gazes longingly in the direction of the main house. She spends time carefully choosing her dress for that dinner. While this definitely could have happened, and I wouldn't have faulted Anne for it, this production seemed to emphasize her weaknesses rather than her strengths. Where's the part where we get to like her, not just feel sorry for her as she apparently wallows in self-pity and martyrdom? I know they were going for suppressed emotion. I get it. I just don't think this was well done. I end up more embarrassed for her than anything else.
  (b) The actress is pretty unattractive. I thought that they'd perhaps follow the novel and show at the end what a change comes over her appearance upon renewing her relationship with Wentworth. Nope. That never happens. She stays unattractive. They didn't do her favors by giving her some pretty dowdy looking clothes. While Anne isn't supposed to be a beauty or an extravagant girl, she isn't supposed to go around looking so poor. I was able to ignore the fact that Hinds (in the 1995 version) is far from gorgeous because the adaptation felt so true to the original. So, I think I could have done the same here with this Anne, if I had found this Anne likable. (As a side note, while the lead actor here is pretty handsome, I wasn't overly impressed with his acting. It just seemed to suit the purpose. Maybe someone can convince me otherwise.)

This interpretation didn't work for me (and I'm not a purist). Part of the charm of the 1995 version, to me, was it was able to give you a taste of how dull Anne's life was after refusing Wentworth. So, yes, it felt a little slow. However, it was very much in keeping with the tone of the novel. Instead of distracting you with the beautiful scenery at Lyme and some of the wonderful music like this production does, the 1995 one focused on Anne and Wentworth and the quiet intensity of their feelings. You didn't need magic camera work to manipulate.",1299024000,3,3065,4.6353591160221

Plus there is a very silly scene where Anne runs for what seems like an hour. It was pointless and absurd. It would have been much better to have taken that screen time to let the actors act.

2758996,4,B000N6U0VU,"I am a very big fan of Jane Austin and have always loved watching the Masterpiece theatre's versions of her wonderful books. I saw this movie several years ago and had been looking for it. Though I agree with the other reviewers that the previous people descriptions of the supporting actors and somewhat of the ordering of the film, I believe it was a very good adaptation of Persuasion. Though at first I was not very thrilled by Hawkins performance, as you get into the film, you start to see that the somewhat meekness she portrays is in fact just her way of trying to keep from having her sniveling invalid sister throw a fit. She, at ever turn, seems to try and keep her sadness at bay by trying to do good for others (just like so many of Austins wonderful heroines.) As for the Captain. He could not be more lushes. Though Rupert could at some times have done more facial expressions, there is no better scene then when he reads the letter. I agree with the others that her running all over the place was a bit ridiculous, but I don't even pay attention to her. For me, it is all about him in that moment. His voice, inflection and phrasing of the letter is so captivation and stirring, that I can't help but wish I was the crazy girl running my head off, for whom he'd written that amazing letter. Though there are some point where you feel there should have been some changes (or not quite so many) , I believe this movie gets by, actually, more then by on the wonderful charisma the two Mains seem to have together. The wonderful tension that resonates fits perfectly with what I believe the book had originally meant to portray.

2758998,3,B000N6U0VU,"Persuasion was the only Jane Austen novel that I had yet to read, and I had not read the book before I'd happened to see this production on Masterpiece theater on PBS.  Since I had not read the book, nor had seen the 1995 version with Amanda Root I really had nothing to compare it to.

The novel follows the story of Anne Elliot, the daughter of a rather, poor baronet who has completely mismanaged his money since the death of his wife.  Mr Elliot is a very interesting character, he is so self-important and snobbish and provides alot of comic entertainment throughout the novel.  When the movie opens, Anne is arranging for their home to be let out while the family moves to Bath in order to try and save some money.  Anne learns that the family coming to stay in their home is the sister of the man she fell in love with years ago who asked her to marry him but whom she eventually turned, down because at the time she was persuaded that he had no money to really offer her.  From this point Anne and Captain Frederick Wentworth eventually meet and we get to watch and see if the couple can ever move forward from the past and find their way back to each other. I really liked it then, I thought the way it was filmed with allowing us personal glimpses into Sally Hawkins's thoughts and feelings created a unique relationship between her and the audience. I thought that Rupert Penry-Jones was an excellent Captain Frederick Wentworth, extremely handsome, cold and still hurt by Anne Elliot's decision despite the fact that time has moved on. I also loved the film locations and cotumes.  Lyme is so beautiful and those scenes are really classic.

After seeing this movie, I purchased the book to read and found myself a bit disappointed with the movie version.  Though I still think that the casting of Sally Hawkins and Captain Wentworth was excellent and I do believe that they portrayed their parts accurately, I was a little saddened by the way the movie ends.  It is completely different from the book and even though before I'd read the book I liked it, now I know that the original ending is much better.  It is so dramatic and much more emotional, especially for Austen.  It makes the ending of the movie, with Anne running through the streets of Bath seem rather stupid and silly.

I relate to the fact that she had a bond with her sister. I relate to the fact that she loved writing. I could watch any Jane Austen adapted version or themed movie a hundred times and never get tired. The same goes to leaving my TV on Masterpiece Theatre. Maybe I was a British woman in one of my past lives. I just love watching British period films. Anyways, this is my favorite film version of ""Persuasion"", and I've seen every single Jane Austen film out there. I always cry each time I see this version. Sally Hawkins is such a great actress and she does an excellent job as Anne Elliot. I really relate to this storyline. I've had boyfriends in my life, and I've always been the good, loyal, honest, trustworthy girlfriend, but I can honestly and genuinely say that I never experienced being deeply and passionately in love with someone. I'm 37, and I've never been in love with a man or told a guy that I was in love with him. To tell a guy that I was in love with him would be a major deal for me. And I've never ever done that because I don't take saying things like that lightly. There was one guy who I think had the potential for me to have those feelings for the first time but I think my current health problems scared him away. I think of Julia Roberts and Javier Bardem in the ""Eat, Pray, Love"" movie. I think Javier's character says to Julia's character, ""You don't need a lover, you need a champion."" When he said that, I thought to myself, ""Word!"" It's going to take a champion of a man to take on me when it comes to love. Anyways, I think Jane Austen books and films fill that void when it comes to the romance department for me. When I watch this film, I really relate to Sally Hawkins' potrayal of Anne. If I was in love with a guy, I would totally be like Anne. This movie has a great cast, but I think this film is excellent because of Sally Hawkins. I found myself feeling my heart racing and being emotional because of Sally Hawkins' portrayal of Anne. And I liked the way that this movie ended. If you want to see an excellent Jane Austen movie, this is it.",1287878400,2,2348,4.151315789473684
2759004,5,B000N6U0VU,This is a sweet movie. Out of the 5 Jane Austen movies I've seen it comes in 2nd right after Pride and Prejudice. It's beautifully filmed and the actors are fantastic. I also have the other version and this one is better.,1287100800,,221,4.285714285714286
2759015,4,B000N6U0VU,"I found this adaptation of Jane Austen's Persuasion included an interesting take on Ann Elliot played by Sally Hawkins.  Physically, she is the plainer of the three sisters but obviously the smartest.  The two incidents where the characters rely on her for medical help (her nephew falling out of the tree and at Louisa's fall from the causeway in Lyme)suggest that in another time, this woman would have gone to medical school and been quite happy as a local rural physician.  Happily, the costume designer has Elizabeth Elliot in wonderfully awful wigs and Mary Musgrove is played as a person on the cusp of a nervous breakdown, so the beauty of sensibility and sanity shine through Hawkins' Ann Elliot.  I also thought the captains' stolen glances of Ann added another element of desire and made one want him to do something other than what he does which is to hurt Ann.  Well scripted, high production values.  Another BBC gem.",1284163200,,931,4.823899371069182

2759017,2,B000N6U0VU,"Persuasion is not one of my favourite Austen stories, but it's a good story and I enjoyed the 1995 version of the film. This version, however, is absolutely horrible. Many of the more recent (made in the 2000's) BBC adaptations to Austen novels have been more... artsy than previous interpretations of the novels, and to date I've enjoyed them. Sense and Sensibility was really well done, the older version of Emma was better but the 2000 one was still good. But Persuasion is where they drop the ball. This is more of an art film than it is a period piece and was almost painful to sit through. I found myself so bored at some points that I would think back to how the 1995 version did it and compare them just to keep occupied. There are so many over played emotions that are lost to the plot because the cameraman was given too much artistic liberty and you get lost in the angles and lenses instead of the plot and characters, and not in the good way.

All I can say is that, if you have watched this film and haven't seen the version with Amanda Root as Anne, go watch it. She is not as pretty as the actress in this film, but Anne isn't supposed to be a world renown beauty, she's rather plain. It's a much better adaptation than this one.",1284076800,2,1245,4.297872340425532

I think that the descriptive statements that accompany the book have put me off for some reason in the past.  I was on an Austin kick, however, and decided to view a DVD of the novel.  I have to say that I'm much encouraged to read the book itself from what I've seen of the story.

That said, however, I didn't feel that the film itself was exceptional.  Perhaps I've seen too many stellar cast versions of other Austin books.  The Emma Thompson version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sense-Sensibility-Special-Edition/dp/0800141660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;with Huge Grant, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman and a totally amazing cast of British character actors and the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-The-Special-Edition-A-E-1996/dp/B00005MP58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)</a>&nbsp;would spoil any viewer for anything less.

Rupert Penry-Jones was not as riveting as Fredrick Wentworth as one might have hoped.  He lacks the dark brooding and sometimes almost sinister character of an Austin romantic hero.  I suspect that his open face and blondness gave him too much of a pleasant ""guy next door"" air.  He gave a very masterful performance as the rejected lover while on horseback accompanying the heroine in her coach, but the stormy weather background and his costume had much to do with it.  One can't help feel that Victorian riding boots, panel fronted trousers, white linen cravats and a flowing cape would give most men the look of a romantic hero.  It's almost too bad they've given them up these days!

Most of the female characters were very unremarkable, almost forgettable.  Sally Hawkins makes a very unprepossessing Anne Elliot.  Her Anne seems to revel in the martyrdom of spinsterhood like a sullen 19 year old.  Instead of being a beautiful woman of great dignity and poise who has chosen to remain unmarried rather than marry someone other than the love of her life, she seems dumpy. Emma Thompson's Ms Dashwood as the practical mainstay of her own natal family is far less frumpy and moody.  When Anne descends the stair in what looks like a gown made from the living room drapes we are doubtlessly intended to contrast this with her sister's fine ball gown and see that Anne is the epitomy of the sensible woman.  Instead we feel like she's attempting a ""poor little me"" routine to gain sympathy. Part of this is the attempted shorthand of the film.  We're meant to understand her through her costume.  It didn't work.

Jennifer Higham as Louisa Musgrove is almost annoying.  Though she doesn't look it, she acts like a girl of 13 or 14 who has a crush on a handsome ""older"" neighbor and who has yet to decide if she wants to be a little girl and play or an adult and court.  She just comes across as totally inappropriate.  It is hardly surprising that Captain Wentworth is shocked to discover he has inadvertently ""committed himself"" to this playful child.  It would be like Edward Ferrars finding himself engaged by accident to the youngest Dashwood sister Margaret because they played tag and swords on the manor grounds!  What the character did do well was to feed information to the audience about Anne.  By contrasting the quiet, unassuming and practical Anne with the light weight antics of Ms Muscove, we see why the hero might have returned after eight years for a second chance.

Probably the greatest missed chance was Julia Davis' Elizabeth Elliot.  So much more could have been made of her character than was.  I could almost see a performance akin to that of Harriet Walter's Fanny Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility or Juliet Stevenson's Mrs. Elton in Emma. These characters did so much to illuminate the lives and personalities of their respective heroines, they almost carried the story.  That's what they're supposed to do.  Almost all Austin characters are there to further the story and provide the reader with information.  Had the director made better use of Elizabeth's behavior as favorite daughter and debutant, more of Anne's personality and place in her family would have been apparent.  Certainly Amanda Hale's neurotic presentation of Mary Elliot Musgrove did a great deal to further the audience's understanding of Anne and her situtation.

2759020,5,B000N6U0VU,"First the movie - This version I'd rate at 4.5, as I felt it was much stronger version of the book (mostly due to Sally Hawkins) and had they been able to use some of the actors from the 2007 version (notable Capt. Wentworth) this could have been even better. (Sadly the 2007 had a superior cast in most respects, but a lesser script).

But I gave it a 5****, for my own stupid reason - the box. I own 560 DVDs and this is the most beautiful case I've seen, let alone own. BBC has hardbound it, so that it actually looks like a book. It's funny because when you see the pictures of the Harry Potter or James Bond ""Collectors"" sets, they actually turn out to be cheap cardboard boxes.

2759038,5,B000N6U0VU,"I am hooked on Jane Austen because of the romance. If you are like me in that respect, do not miss this adaptation of Miss Austen's Persuasion. I dearly loved the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds version but there is not as much passion displayed by Amanda Root in her Anne Elliott as there is in this version with Sally Hawkins playing the same role. And since we have two very different screenplays and directors, differences should be expected. The director of this version allows Sally Hawkins to look squarely into our eyes and pour her emotions out so that we could feel what Anne Elliott was feeling just as if we were sitting or standing face to face with her. And those evolving emotions of dread, shock, loss, despair, and resignation were palpable thanks to Sally Hawkins personality and wonderful skills as an actor. If you can watch this Persuasion and not be caught up in Anne's situation then your own heart is made of stone.

No true purist can give any film adaptation 5-stars and still consider themselves a purist. So, how much leeway do you give screenwriters and directors in retelling an Austen classic? If you are an Austen romantic I think you take each adaptation for what it is and enjoy that version for what it brings to us in retelling Miss Austen's story--whether it is an adaptation of Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, or any other classic novel no matter the author. Now I grant you, the 2K sprint at the finish in this version of Persuasion might have been a little over the top, but it did fit Anne's character in this version. The end of the Ciaran Hinds/Amanda Root version was fine for what it was because Amanda's Anne was so understated. So her catching up with Mr. Hinds' Captain Wentworth in the reunification scene being underplayed does not detract from that version, even though by comparison it lacks the emotion that was allowed Sally Hawkins' Anne.

Which is closer to the Jane Austen novel? Due to the ending scenes alone I would have to say the Hinds/Root version, yet they are both compromises due to length of time allowed and the fact that they are ADAPTATIONS, as they must be for the screen. The bottom line is that if you pass up seeing this version of Persuasion, you would be missing out on a wonderfully retold story and actors that will tug at your heart recreating Jane Austen's characters as interpreted by this screenwriter and developed by this director.",1270598400,12,2432,4.693208430913349

I would have liked to have seen Anne Elliot (Sally Hawkins) with a little less severe hair style, but I thought Sally did a wonderful job bringing Anne to life.

My favorite scene is when Captain Wentworth goes to Anne in the city of Bath and he tells her of a rumor that Admrial Croft had heard, Anne was to marry a Mr. William Elliot and they would live at Kellynch Hall. Admrial and Mrs. Croft (Frederick's sister) are renting Kellynch Hall and if the rumor is true they would have to move. When Anne tells Frederick the Admrial is ""...utterly misinformed"" Rupert Penry-Jones as Frederick Wentworth says ""Misinformed? Utterly?"" his face changed, it was just as clear as day that he was smiling at her. Rupert was a great choice for Frederick and he's nice to look at too.

Apparently, the screen writers felt they were more capable of delivering Jane Austen's vision than she was.  I could have forgiven the small disappointments throughout the movie if the end hadn't been varied beyond recognition.

2759059,4,B000N6U0VU,"I saw this adaptation of Austen's novel on Masterpiece before I saw the 1995 Amanda Root version and before I read the book.  I fell in love with the story and the two lead characters; the strength of their attachment and the circumstances of their story involved me emotionally in a way I had not expected from an Austen novel.  I love Austen's books, but the ones I've read (Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Northanger Abbey) are more light-hearted and less affecting than this one is.

This adaptation is not as faithful to the book as the Amanda Root version, but it works well because it focuses on how Anne and Wentworth feel and how those feelings change during the story.  The first time I watched it, I was wondering what was going on with Wentworth, but he was a bit confused himself, and it all became clear in the end.  Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins were great in their individual roles and there was good chemistry between them, especially in the very last scene, which was not in the book, but which I absolutely loved.

Also, this adaptation shows us in ""real time"" a few scenes that we only learn about at the end in the book.  This is a hard book to adapt, I think, because so much of the action is internal to the characters, so this change helped the story flow better for someone who hadn't yet read the book.

Like many other reviewers, I am not a fan of the running around at the end, because it seemed so unrealistic for someone of Anne's class to have done at the time, but again, it did do a wonderful job of conveying the emotion of the moment.  I think if the BBC and PBS had just given the producers an extra ten minutes of running time to work with, this would have been wonderful.  Then, the role of Mrs. Smith and her relationship with William Elliot could have been made clearer and more important, and we could have seen more of the interaction between Anne and Wentworth at the end of the story.

This adaptation did inspire me to watch the Amanda Root version (which I liked, but not quite as much as this one), and to read the book, which I loved.  It's now my favorite Austen book and Wentworth has replaced Darcy as my favorite romantic hero.

If you are a purist, you may not like this adaptation much, but if you're willing to allow the screen writer a few liberties, or haven't read the book, you may find you really like this movie.",1268092800,6,2375,4.382687927107061

We get to know her real feelings and reactions as if we are another person in the room with her, someone in whom she confides. POV of the camera is very important. One has to really pay attention to more than just the dialogue to appreciate this version. Anne is no wilting violet when it comes to helping her young cousin John when he fell from a tree, She is the most capable and clear thinking of the lot. Everyone turns to her for guidance. And when Louisa falls in Lyme, even Frederick does, understanding that Anne has made the transformation from girl to woman. I loved the scenes in Bath - how the director chose to pan along the long blocks of homes, how she literally has to run to change her fate.

What I enjoy most about it (besides seeing Rupert Penry-Jones as Wentworth!) is all of the staring. Anne and Wentworth do a lot of staring here; and they stare directly at us, allowing us momentary, unguarded access to their private misery. Penry-Jones is especially adept at communicating with his eyes the years of heartache Wentworth endured but thought he had conquered as well as the fresh wounding of his heart each time he is in her company. Sally Hawkins's Anne has many more opportunities to stare than Wentworth; but she does it so often that it doesn't always achieve the desired effect of granting us access to her emotions but, instead, results in our feeling that we have intruded on her privacy. Still, she seems more aware of our presence than does Wentworth; so she is more intentional in her stares.

I agree with others that Anne's running through the streets of Bath is ridiculous. The first time I saw the scene, I took it literally. However, after watching it several more times, I am convinced that it might've been meant as a visual representation of what was going on in Anne's mind rather than what her body was doing. But if that is the case, the technique wasn't successful since so many people have taken it so literally. Too much happens during Anne's gallop through Bath. Surely she would've overtaken Wentworth before he returned to the admiral's quarters, wrote the note, charged Harvel with delivering it, escorted his sister and the admiral to take the waters, and struck up a conversation with Charles Musgrove. If Anne were actually running willy nilly in public, why didn't anyone on the street gauk at her in surprise? I mean, how many nineteenth-century baronet's daughters could they expect to see running full-tilt? Her friends--the Crofts, Mrs. Smith, Charles, Wentworth--are only mildly surprised by her dashing about. Charles feins interest in why she burst upon the scene, but easily talks himself out of it. In reality they would've expected to hear Anne tell them about a matter of life or death. Also, Anne's ability to run at break-neck speed for so long a distance would have taken training as a marathoner, especially as we see her recover so quickly once she has found Wentworth. So I'm ""persuaded"" that she didn't run at all.

I see a huge flaw in the story with regard to the sale of the Elliot estate. If I am not mistaken, British primogeniture prevented heirs from selling property and thereby depriving future heirs of their birthright. Heirs have possession of the property during their lifetime; but upon their death, the estate and title pass to the next male in line. Anne's father had no authority to sell the estate even if the money-loving Elliot cousin were to agree to it. and Wentworth had no power to buy it.

The casting is, for the most part, is well done. In my opinion, only Anne's sisters are miscast. Mary is a goofball, when there is no need of comic relief. Julia Davis was 41 when she played the part of the 29-year-old Elizabeth; she'd have done better to seek the fountain of youth than the waters of Bath.

*****Update: I ordered the DVD from Amazon yesterday at lunch and chose free shipping and was delighted to have it in my possession before lunch today. Great service, Amazon and UPS! I was especially thrilled to see the unusual DVD case, which looks like a small hardcover book when it sits on a shelf and which feels much like a book when you hold it in your hand. The case is thicker than a regular DVD case, so I first thought that it might contain 2 DVDs. I wasn't all that disappointed when I found out that it contained just the one disc because the packaging is so spectacular. It is obvious that the people at the BBC believe that we'll want to keep this DVD for many years, so they gave us a durable and beautiful package.*****",1267574400,3,4040,4.676511954992968
2759064,4,B000N6U0VU,"This a very nice adaptation and Sally Hawkins is masterful as always. I think the only problem was that it was only given 90 minutes, so a lot of plot and some character development needed to be trimmed. To have Anne racing around Bath looking for Wentworth wasn't really true to the story but it was beautifully done. This script really pushes Anne's heartbreak to the forefront but that's appropriate and really what makes the story so relevant. Anne's fear of being alone -- especially surrounded by a dreary family -- is what so many young people experience at some point in their lives.",1267488000,4,591,4.6923076923076925
2759075,3,B000N6U0VU,"The gold standard of Jane Austen books to movies is the Colin Firth version of P&P, and part of that I credit to the length of the movie. All the subtlties and emotions of an Austen novel take time to draw out, and when I saw that this version of Persuasion was 90 minutes I was so shocked I thought it had to have a second part. Instead I got rushed scenes that were telling a story without much of a sense of what was going on. The early scenes where Anne and Captin Wentworth meet are so short that there's little chance for the viewer to feel the intensity of the emotions, the sense of longing and loss, instead just as you get it, they'e on to another important part and you get wiplash. Their walk through the woods was just odd to me, again while reading the book I remember there being an intensity and it felt long and drawn out, but the scene just moves along, suddenly Anne falls and then the climax where Caption Wentworth singles Anne out as needing a carriage ride seems so unimportant that you wouldn't creidt it as a sign of his caring about Anne.

I agree with everyone that the last 10 minutes are bad, but what bothers me is not so much the running, as the list of odd couinsdences, it's rather Dickonsonian, just as Wentworth comes to see Anne, the whole family arrives, and just as Anne is running to find Wentworth her friend comes up and tells her some news (which is no longer relevent to the story) and just as she's going somewhere else she runs into someone else, I just didn't believe any of it. Of course in order to fit a novel that takes days to absorb into 90 minutes it's I guess the best you can do.

------- But wait, while I am not going to recant anything I have said I would like to edit my review, because I have watched this film again, and realized it's not that bad.  First off a movie can not really be so bad if every time it's on tv you flip over and watch it. I have to admit that I must be a but of a snob to have written the above, because this movie is watchable and enjoyable, and of all the Persuasion's I have seen it is the one that creates the best romantic tension between Anne and Wentworth. I have come to really enjoy watching this movie. Now that does not mean I don't lament as we relocate to Bath and the whole thing gets shot to hell, Jane crafted such a beautiful ending and whoever wrote or directed this realized they were running out of time and clearly said, we need to rush this up a ton, and slaughtered Jane's work. I cannot get over that, and tend to flip away once all the running starts, but forgetting that, this is a delightful and romantic movie and you should watch it already.",1267315200,,2655,4.191780821917808

Compared to the 1995 version starring Amanda Root and Ciarn Hinds, Persuasion 2007's script leaves much to be desired.  The actors were another problem; they just seemed to put very little emotion into their characters. While watching the current one, I kept asking myself if I would have understood the depth of Austen's story had I not been familiar with the 1995 version and the answer was no.

2759078,2,B000N6U0VU,"The cinematography is shaky and stilted.  It's as if the director wants the emotion to come from the shaking of the camera as opposed to the characters.  Anne stares into the camera frequently, as if we are somehow to see into her soul and empathize with her deep pain.  However, this is difficult, since all she seems to do is cry and we do not understand enough of the backstory to see her as anything other than pessimistic, morose and self-pitying.  I never felt connected with the charater, and therefore found myself underwhelmed at the classic Austen romantic climax.

The final scene was rushed and ridiculous.  There is no reason a gentleman's daughter would *run* around Bath.  Then to have her just miss her quarry several times in a row became humorous.  I found myself laughing at what should be a serious, romantic moment.

I liked two things only about this version.  The first was Anthony Stewart Head (of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame) as Mr. Elliot.  He was delightful as an over-the-top buffoon.  The other thing I appreciate about the film was its brevity.",1266710400,3,1076,4.756756756756757

2759080,2,B000N6U0VU,"This is the most wrong-headed, disappointing version of anything associated with Jane Austen that I have seen since that awful Howard Fast play The Novelist.  While some of the casting is rather appealing (Wentworth particularly), everything seems to have been rewritten and re-ordered and pasted in to totally change the point of the novel.  Spoilers ahead: It's no longer about having the character to withstand a lonely spinsterhood and a hostile family while remaining true to yourself and your apparently doomed love ... no, in this version it's about weeping and moping and running through the streets in an utterly undignified way if necessary in order to get your man and best of all a really nice house (and yeah, he WAS the guy you were in love with before, but apparently what's REALLY great is that now he can buy you the family estate, woo hoo!).

The actress who plays Henrietta also appears to be making an attempt to steal the show through sheer weirdness.  Virtually every opportunity for comedy is instead played for pathos. Jane Austen without a sense of humor is hard to imagine, but these guys have done their best to achieve it.  It's very, very, very, very bad, unless perhaps you have never read Jane Austen and just like costume dramas about mopey girls who end up marrying rich.

You will do much better with the older version with Ciaran Hinds.  It's perhaps a little slow and dark out of the gate, but it's true to the spirit of the novel.  This one is not.",1265500800,12,1485,4.684615384615385

Make no mistake though- This does not hold a candle to the Amanda Root/Ciarin Hinds version.  I don't care if Root and Hinds had been twice the age that they were when they made their version- They were both far superior in their roles than Hawkins/Penry-Jones.  Cirian Hinds in particular wrapped up the definitive take on Captain Wentworth.

BTW, I'm assuming that all of the comments on what a hunk Penry-Jones is are coming from English viewers.  Penry-Jones is not by any means a bad looking fellow.

""Persuasion"" is my favorite Austen novel of the four I have read so I was very interested in seeing what this adaptation would hold. Overall, I was very pleased.

I sort of enjoyed watching this because even though it was a bit painful I've always thought that Anne should have felt very, very sad. She did, after all, basically abandon Frederick even though she knew he loved her so deeply.

The minor characters really made the movie for me. Anne's entire family is so self-centered. I enjoyed watching Mary and all her ""illnesses."" I have a few friends that act like that, always full of self pity. Watching Anne deal with her family really let her good nature shine through.

2759126,4,B000N6U0VU,"'Persuasion' ranks as one of my all-time favourite romances. It's an absolutely beautiful story of a woman, Anne, reluctantly turning her back on love, then being presented with a possible second chance years later. It's also a story of a man, Frederick, fighting his feelings for a woman, and slowly losing that fight.

I've seen the 1995 adaptation on more than one occasion, and ultimately, I have to say that I prefer the 2007 edition. Don't get me wrong -- I do like the earlier version, but I love this one. Here are my primary reasons.

1. The Sense of Consequence

I think this version does a fantastic job of centralizing Anne's feelings. It truly conveys the effects of an old loss, and renewed pain. I very much enjoyed her occasional narration, which placed a good amount of focus on her emotions -- the regret, the longing, the pondering. This sense of consequence isn't just limited to the narration, though. It's present in every subtle look of undying love that Sally Hawkins (wonderfully cast) gives Rupert Penry-Jones. Her expressions constantly tell a story, being sorrowful at certain times, while bordering on hopeful at others. Likewise, I also enjoyed Rupert's presentation of Captain Wentworth's pain. Seeing Anne again has brought him to a state of constant restraint and false apathy. Yet all the while, little hints of his true feelings begin to escape him. Of course, there's also the matter of Anne's second chance. This is highlighted by scenes in which she stirs in denial, dares to be wishful, gets pursued by another, and dreads the seemingly inevitable moment in which Frederick will wed someone else.

In short, I loved watching the many effects that this relationship had on the characters. That level of consequence caused me to be more engaged in the story.

2. Dialogue

I absolutely love the way 'Persuasion' is written -- in any form or version. Sometimes it's fun to just sit back and listen to the beauty of the English language when written and spoken well. I happen to prefer this version due to the added element of Anne's narration, along with some of the acting (particularly Tobias Menzies as William Elliot, Joseph Mawle as Harry Harville, Anthony Head as Sir Walter, and Alice Krige as Lady Russell).

3. Great Music

Another engaging element to the story is the excellent music composed by Martin Phipps. The tunes are beautifully emotional, and the man behind them is one of the best in the business.

Overall, this will always be one of my favourite films, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys romances, classic or contemporary.",1248825600,8,2587,4.874715261958998
2759127,2,B000N6U0VU,"Persuasion is my favourite Austen, so I may be a little biased, but I've yet to see an adaption of this which fully does the book justice. The Amanda Root version comes pretty close and is faithful to the book, but it fails to really capture the repressed passion of Anne (and the actress was far too old- she's meant to be 27!)
That said this newer version really massacres Anne's character. She's meant to be intellegent, quiet, yet confident and aware of her own worth, despite her family. In this version she is a mousy, retiring, boring victim. There is little chemistry between the two leads and the male lead shows little emotion (or acting skill). They were both pretty nauseating actually.
And OH MY GOD- the ending. I know others have mentioned it, but I have to say- what the ???
Fifteen minutes of her running here and there with her skirts hiked up to her knees.
And then the kiss. What to say about that. Here was one last chance to show a little romance, a little chemistry, to make the audience believe that they were in love.
It was the worst kiss in a movie that I have ever seen. I am NOT exagerating. The movie is worth watching just for this bit, because it is so bad that it's funny. You don't see his face or expression at all and Anne's doing this verrry slow inching her face towards him while opening and closing her mouth like a fish- and he just stands there. Makes me think that he's actually looking at something else, because he doesn't get involved at all.
Overall it's not awful, worth a watch if you have to see every Austen adaptation ever made (which I do), but the last ten minutes bring it down from average to bad.
If only producers would run their Austen adaptations by me first. Sigh.",1248652800,5,1725,4.39375
2759128,4,B000N6U0VU,"If you love the story of Persuasion as I do, you will enjoy this version.  If you appreciate good filmmaking, however, you will find some of the storytelling choices kind of odd.

I am an Austen fan from way back.  I've read all the books, seen every possible film version, and even visited her house in Chawton.  I loved the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds because they made a good couple, even if they were both a bit older than the roles.  That version was mostly faithful to the book and flowed really smoothly.

Now, this version I got for the flippin' gorgeous Rupert Penry-Jones, whom I have loved in the series ""Spooks"" (MI-5 in the U.S.).  I thought he was a terrific choice as the dashing Captain, the subject of an eight-year obsession on the part of Anne and an undeniable Regency chick-magnet.  Sally Hawkins, on the other hand, took a little time to grow on me.  In modern dress and make-up, she is a beautiful woman, but in this version she often looked a little ill and greasy-haired.  I found it harder to believe that Wentworth would still be in love with her (although that's what I really wanted to believe).  In the 1995 version, the character of Anne underwent a gradual makeover, both in her appearance and her confidence, so that in Bath she looked quite fresh and lovely again and had some backbone.  Here Anne looked kind of the same, always off balance with her family, timid with even her friends, and terrified of Frederick.

I liked the fact that they showed some scenes of Frederick and Harville alone, telling his side of the story for a  change.  It removed the suspense about whether or not he still loved Anne, but it was a good way to insert things from the book that Wentworth just tells Anne about in the end, when it doesn't advance the plot.

I was not fond of many of the supporting cast, especially Elizabeth and Mary, but I could overlook that.  When one has enjoyed one version of a story for so long (and the 1995 film had such an excellent cast), it's sometimes difficult to appreciate a different take on the roles.  I also wondered why they had changed certain things in the story that worked so well in the book and previous version (overhearing the conversation between Harville and Anne).  I understand them wanting to put a different spin on things this time, though.

A couple of times one character yells another character's name over and over to the point of being annoying.  I think the screenwriter could have come up with some better dialogue than just, ""Harry!  Harry!  Harry!  Harry!"" or ""Anne!  Anne!  Anne!  Anne!""

Minor complaints and personal preferences about casting or liberties taken with the story can be forgiven.  However, the ending to this movie was so incredibly botched it's a wonder what they were thinking.  It feels like they must have run out of money for the budget and had to slap together an ending to film in one day or something.  After all the slow build up, the climax is completely rushed and silly, not least because Anne takes it into her head to go sprinting from the Royal Crescent down to the Roman Baths and back (which is about two miles each way, if my memory is any good), with the same form as an Olympic marathoner!  It is so out of character for a lady of that period, whatever she might be feeling about her long-lost fianc, even more so than the very awkward, public kiss on the sidewalk.  It also doesn't even make sense because she had just CLEARED UP the misunderstanding with Wentworth with regards to Mr Elliot (which was kind of sweet, how they did that), and yet he goes walking out the door and she feels like she must follow.

Her conversation with Mrs Smith was not only shocking because of her inexplicable recovery but the Deus Ex Machina-like way she runs into the picture to ""explain everything"" about Mr Elliot but without giving any evidence.  And, somehow, this quick chat gave Wentworth enough time to go home, write her a letter, give it to Harville to take to her, and run off to the Baths with the Crofts.  There must have been some kind of warping of the space-time continuum for this to occur!  I just hope Wentworth was on horseback for all his excursions around town (the same route that Anne took but without ever crossing her path) because he seemed to go a lot faster and yet wasn't out of breath as she was.  I could have forgiven her one crazy sprint through town, but she went and did it twice!  The very last scene, although also an invention, did a lot to restore a little romantic dignity to the characters.",1247875200,3,4558,4.518925518925519
2759129,3,B000N6U0VU,"I really do enjoy watching Jane Austen screen adaptations, and for the most part, this was okay. Maybe it was because I knew that there were other things going on in the story, that when it ended, I couldn't feel satisfied. Nothing was resolved other than Anne's romance with Wentworth. I went so far as to look for 'deleted scenes' from the special feature section of the DVD - and then discovered that there was none. That was disappointing as well.

Yes, the last 10 minutes were very strange, and left me entirely unsatisfied with how it ended. I know what happens *in the book* and in other versions, though, so it's not as if I was left totally in the dark.
In fairness, each rendition of any of Austen's books needs to be a bit different than that which has come before. Some of this version's experiments worked better than others.",1247529600,2,839,4.519736842105263

I like Penry-Jones in Spooks and the BBC's Cambridge Spies immensely. I did not care for him in this role. I can't pin down exactly why, but I simply didn't feel he was right for the part....to distant, unemotional, even nonverbally, facially. Granted, Hinds, who can be explosive when he acts, was also very contained, but Jones here did NOT come across as contained, rather as nonresponsive much of this film.  Overall, I felt none of the actors were that strong; the pacing also dragged with this version to me. If you want the film, buy the earlier BBC Persuasion!",1247184000,,713,4.733870967741935

This is a very good rendition of the Jane Austin book Persuasion, but it had the potential of being Great.  I think it was extremely well cast.  And, having seen several different versions of this same book made into TV/Movies, I can without hesitation say that the roles of Sir Elliot and Captain Wentworth were played brilliantly by both actors.  I was most impressed by Anthony Head's portrayal as he brought Sir Elliot to life with all his affectations without making him appear silly or ackward as others have done.

Indeed, I wouldn't change a single actor for each role, but I would have preferred the costume designer to have made Anne Elliot dress in a manner more befitting her station.  Indeed, between her constant head ducking and drab manner of dress I kept wondering if her role was confused with Cinderella!  Sally Hawkins is a fine actress and a lovely lady; she should have been allowed to bring a maturity of character to her role without seeming like the unwanted step-daughter.  In fact, I can't imagine Sir Elliot not insisting his daughter dress to befit his own vain image - especially in company.

Still, don't let my one criticism keep you from watching/owning this fine rendition of Persuasion.  It is well worth the experience.",1243987200,,1361,4.748936170212766

Her clothes certainly are, but if you want dowdy, see the 1995 version. After seeing this again I think Anne is pretty and, of course, Frederick Wentworth is very handsome.  This version is more fun to watch first, because almost everyone in the film is good-looking (or at least not really bad-looking!), the surroundings are beautiful, I can actually understand what they're saying without having the subtitles on (yes, I needed them for the 1995 version), and the love story is much more believable.

Could have been done better and still gotten the point across.  I do like this version more in all the other areas.  Her sisters (and her father) are less annoying but still convincing.  Captain Wentworth (Who is EXTREMELY good looking)is much more convincing and I could actually tell of the love between them even after all these years (is that not why we watch) than in the other one.

I think that Adm. Croft was Elizabeth's uncle in the 2005 version of Pride & Prejudice.  It didn't get everything right, but, at least it hit the main points.  The 1995 adaptation was more like the book, however, I thought this one made me feel more for Anne's plight, and explained some of the details left out before, in her case, and, in his.  I especially liked the conversations with him & Harville.  It showed how good of friends they were, and explained the situation between Captain Wentworth & Louisa more from his perspective, and I found that to be refreshing.  The music is beautiful, too.  Yes, I missed the true conversation between Anne & Harville!  That was a mistake to change that, and Anne running all over Bath didn't really make any sense.  Maybe the writers wanted us to feel for her love, and urgency not to lose him again?  Also, did anyone else think that Anne's clothes weren't as pretty as Elizabeth's or Mrs. Clay?  I would've liked to see her a little more dressed up sometimes.  And, as for Mrs. Smith, well, at least, they didn't have her confess that she was lame, then, to see her walking so well.

I haven't yet read any of the novels by Jane Austen,so I cannot judge how true to the book it is.

My real problem was that I didn't much care for the character of Anne Elliot(Sally Hawkins),I thought she was incredibly dull,and it was totally unbelievable that the 'Drop Dead GORGEOUS'(but his acting here doesn't thrill either)Frederick Wentworth(Rupert Perry-Jones) would have fallen for such a plain Jane,and pined for years for her!

Now I want to see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.

So I can't really recommend this version.",1235260800,2,756,4.661654135338346
2759163,1,B000N6U0VU,"If you were mightily impressed by the understated brilliance of the acting in the 1995 version of this film, which included memorable performances by Amanda Root, Fiona Shaw, and Sophie Thompson, then you will throw up your hands at the many missteps made in the 2007 production.

The camera-work is choppy and unrefined. The director and DP have obviously never understood the artistic value of arranging a figure meaningfully in a landscape.

I won't dissect the production by how derivative it is, as I feel that this must be obvious to anyone who watches this version and remembers the 1995 version of Persuasion, 1998 version of Mansfield Park, and 1996 version of Sense and Sensibility (all worthy productions). All I can say is that the director establishes his vain wish that he could have Patricia Rozema's talent.

So, the real review: The script, the costuming, the (mis)casting / acting, there's nothing redeemable about this version of Persuasion.

The script is laughable. First, entire speeches are lifted from their developmentally situated positions in the book (for example, the debate on the constancy of men and women occurs after all the action has given the novel characters fodder for reflection; here, pulled from the end of the story to the muddy middle) and placed with no discretion or context in the mouths of characters who could not possibly be reflective enough to speak them (as in the above example, the very characters whom these speeches reproach in the novel end up uttering their own condemnation). Don't assume that this is a brilliant stroke of irony worthy of The Mistress of Irony (Jane Austen) but somehow overlooked until reworked by the hack who cobbled together the shambles of this script. You'd be making a big mistake. Those characters who do keep their own important speeches are forced to deliver their lines without motivation or context. For example, during one pivotal scene, Miss Elliot excuses herself for not being good company, which elicits an unwarranted and confusing speech by her cousin about how her accomplishments are not recognized by the world. Huh? How did we get from . . . to . . . ? The script is full of these talking-passed-each-other moments that make you want to throw rotten vegetables at the TV.

The acting is atrocious. Though, it hardly surprises one, considering the nonsensical script with which the actors had to work. Despite these difficulties, the lead actress portrays her character with a painful-to-watch clumsiness, gracelessness, and--excuse me for saying it--ickiness. This Anne Elliot just . . . makes you want to gag, she's THAT gross. It's difficult to see how her manner could possibly recommend her to three separate men and anyone with a discerning mind, especially as her script rarely gives her the opportunity to say anything that would (a) impress anyone or (b) even set her apart from the other female characters. The dumpy actress who plays Anne Elliot cannot even be allowed costumes that fit her to assist her transformation. They are all too short, unbecoming in color, and make her seem more like a countrywoman (Emma's Mrs. Martin, perhaps) than a baronet's plain daughter.

Likewise, Mary Musgrove is unusually grotesque in this production. The script writer and director must have believed hypochondria to be an insufficient caricature enabler. The actress plays Mary as if Mary Musgrove were Erma Prunesquallor (Fiona Shaw's excellently portrayed character in Gormenghast). In my more charitable moments, I grant this actress must be astounding in her portrayal of family resemblance. Mary Musgrove is even more disgusting than her icky sister.

Perhaps most lamentable, the people in charge of this production have simply written Persuasion off as an opportunity for women to marinate in the neglect, self-pity, self-effacement, and melodramatic frenzy of an Anne Elliot who has none of the refinements of taste, mind, or manner of the original.

2759175,4,B000N6U0VU,"Jane Austen's ""Persuasion"" is an excellent movie - but one must pay close attention to who is who, otherwise the tale can be lost in the multitude of characters.  Perhaps this is typical Austen fare - family relations interacting with each supplying bits and pieces of information - but the danger is that the relationships between the characters is hard to follow interfering with the story.  We were able to stop the DVD periodically and go back to review what had been said in order to clarify the story.  After having watched it, we agreed: now that we know who is who, we should watch it again to better enjoy the story.
  I recall that some of the Earle Stanley Gardner ""Perry Mason"" stories included a list of characters and their relationships at the beginning of the book.  Something along these lines might have been helpful in this movie - but I am unsure how one would accomplish this.  Perhaps as a DVD ""Extra Feature""?  I suspect the novel more clearly identifies the characters, but for those who have not read the novel, who is who is hard to follow.
  The love story between Ann and Captain Wentworth is excellent and builds to a climactic ending easily forecast perhaps 3/4 of the way through the movie, but we are forced to wait for it.  These anxious movies increase the charm of the tale.  Being a fan of the Patrick O-Brian Aubrey-Maturin series of historical novels, stories involving naval officers ashore are as interesting as those of adventures at sea.  The period dress seems authentic and the settings appear genuine.  I highly recommed Persuasion.  Indeed, I may even be ""Persuaded"" to read the book!",1232323200,2,1630,4.710247349823321

very seldom will you find a screen play that is true to the book. It is not the same medium and cannot always be presented the same and then there is time constraints.

I didn't dislike her overall portrayal of Anne Elliot, but there were things that bothered me: for example, she seems to be constantly kind of wavering, or on the brink of panic, or something. I just got tired of her little panting, helpless moments. This leads to the second (and more serious) annoyance: 2) The Kiss. I don't want to give anything away, but seriously, that kiss made me feel slightly sick. I just kind of felt like, if you must start kissing in the middle of the street, DO it already before anyone sees you, don't spend like five minutes hesitating and panting and darting you heads back and forth. Actually, the whole last ten minutes or so were a bit problematic.
Aside from these little issues, though, I really enjoyed the movie. Rupert Penry-Jones is smokin' as the hero and, besides her little hesitancy issues, Sally Hawkins is a very good Anne.

2759196,5,B000N6U0VU,"I LOVED this movie! I confess I love all of Miss Austen's books and love to see any adaptation.  I don't care if things are put in or left out so much, because I like to see the adaptation style.  I thought the leads were wonderfully cast, I could look at the captain all day:)
The only part of the entire movie I didn't like was (spoiler) after Anne ran back to her home to find the captain, when they finally go to kiss, she had this thick, ropy saliva that was strung out between her lips and teeth and was just so yuck and obvious to me that I couldn't help thinking that he was ""acting"" here.  But then again, I am in the dental field, so I perhaps noticed that a lot more than some.  But otherwise, I loved the cinematography, lovedddd her wacky sisters (Mary was an amazing actress and just a joy to giggle at) and the captain, just wow.  The music was incredile, I would be the first in line to buy this soundtrack.  My sister borrowed this DVD from me, and is in Australia right now with it, and I cannot WAIT to get it back!!

2759197,4,B000N6U0VU,"I first viewed this movie last winter (2008) when the BBC released several new Masterpiece Theater productions. Although the screenwriters combined some scenes, dialog and characters, ostensibly to shorten the story for filmimg, and that bothers me as a Jane Austen fan, I still like the movie for its own sake.  Once I overlook its faults, there are several things I enjoy.  One of them is the atmosphere the filmmakers create, of hopelessness early on for Anne Elliot, as she is a spinster who erringly refused the hand of her one true love.  Her regret and loneliness are well-portrayed.  One gets the feeling that Anne has nothing to hide from the viewer, and that adds to her appeal.  But the movie, nearly as well as the book, also portrays Anne's rising hope and, in the end, her well-deserved joy.  Though a fabrication of the screenwriter's imaginations, the very final scene COULD very well have happened, and we want it to, for Anne's sake.
I have watched this movie three times in the last several months.",1224806400,3,1017,4.782857142857143
2759198,3,B000N6U0VU,"This production may not be accurate and in keeping with the novel but I liked it.

 Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins have wonderful chemistry together and she as Anne Eliott give s a really moving performance as the heart-broken and long suffering Anne who was 'persuaded', forced,) by her controlling family and dear friend to turn away the man she loved a long time ago, beause he was not suitable for a baron's daughter.
 And meeting him again after all these years, both their circumstances have changed. She knows her feelings for him hasn't changed at all and knows agony once more knowing he is ready to settle down and has chosen his bride. He is cold towards her and despite his anger at her when she broke up with him, he can't help but worry over her now.

Rupert Penry-Jones is gorgeous as the cold and aloof Wentworth. Loved the scene when he meets Lady Russell again for the first time since she separated him and Anne and is so chilling but unfailingly polite. And the little things he does against his will, shows he still as some feeling for Anne.

I didn't like the end scenes with Anne running the streets of Bath, looking for Wenthworth. Whats with that? In those days well brought up young ladies wouldn't be caught dead behaving in that manner.
 But despite that and few other descrepencies, quite enjoyed this version.",1222732800,,1345,4.630252100840337

2759201,5,B000N6U0VU,"I had read the book many years ago and when I heard that there was to be a new Jane Austen series, I re-read it and the others and Persuasion took a very definite first place.
 As to this TV version, first time round I loved it and I have found, on repeat viewing only very recently, that it was even better than I remembered. I thoroughly enjoyed the settings, the music and particularly, the two lead performances which I think were thoroughly convincing. Of the supporting roles, I thought Anthony Head was magnificently arch and enjoyably shallow and horrible as Sir Walter, Sam Hazeldine bumbling, delightful and sweet (especially in his relations with Anne which are so kind and redolent, on his part, of what might have been) and I must be the only person who thought that Mary Musgrove was just exactly as she should have been! Peter White is a great favourite of mine so I loved his bluff yet gentle Admiral.
 The pacing was odd, I admit, presumably because of the time constraints and like everyone else, I would have liked all of the letter-not just because the written version is so beautiful but because I thought Rupert Penry-Jones' voice-over was absolutely perfect. There's a little subtle break in his voice half way through that gets me every time. The scene in the shop was also wonderful-he, in particular, showed so much by doing so little. There was a real feeling of strong feelings ruthlessly repressed because he was so afraid of being hurt again.
 I think Anne was beautifully played by Sally Hawkins and she looked just right. At the start she was obviously depressed but determined to live the best life she could. Then, at the end, she realised she had another chance to live the life she really wanted and gathered every ounce of strength of character she had to grab it with both hands. That was the symbolism of the running for me.
 As to RPJ looking too young and unweathered for a sea captain, in reality, that's probably true but the whole point about Austen's description of him is that he had lost none of what she called his (this may be in the wrong order!) ""open, glowing, manly"" look in the eight years he and Anne had been apart. And even her vain, looks-obsessed father who castigated all sailors because they supposedly looked rough, had to admit eventually that Captain Wentworth was an exception. RPJ had that in spades, as well as the depth of feeling for a role where so much is under the surface. I thought he was wonderful in it and that he and Sally Hawkins created something touching to the contemporary mind, yet absolutely in keeping with the original, of a relationship that nearly didn't make it.
 As to ""the kiss"", it wasn't the chocolate-box romanticism that many accuse modern visual producions of overlaying on Austen-it was hesitant, full of both fear and longing, human, messy and completely believable. The sunlit ending at Kellynch, I think, was symbolic of pent-up longing fulfilled in every way, which is really the point of the entire book, and I loved it.
 I've even loved writing this about it!",1220918400,66,3063,4.673469387755102

The acting is top notch and you can feel the heartbreak of lost love between Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot, when Sally Hawkins cries you will cry too!!!  The music from Martin Phipps(same composer as BBC's North and South) is superb!!  I wish he would release a CD of his BBC production scores!!  The only distraction is the running scene at the end!!!

I don't think the characterization of the the lead role strays as far as some would suggest.  I do agree there are a few elements that seem unlikely for the culture but these are few and insignificant.  I think it can rival, though not surpass, the A&E version but to each his own.",1219449600,,441,4.419753086419753
2759215,3,B000N6U0VU,"I rate this higher than ""Becoming Jane"" (3.5) just because it's ""Persuasion"", and the story is just fantastic - though Austen should get credit for it.  Overall, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't fantastic.  It was a far better effort in comparison to its 1990s predecessor than the 2005 ""Pride and Prejudice"" was to its 1990s counterpart.

Sally Hawkins didn't do horribly, and she conveys the gentleness and patience of Anne Elliot well.  When she's happy to see Wentworth, you can tell the difference between her sadder moods, but I don't remember quite feeling Anne's despondency as much.  If Amanda Root hadn't gone before her, I doubt we'd all beat up on Hawkins as badly.  It's really  not a bad performance.

So Rupert Penry-Jones is the finest looking Wentworth I've seen yet, though not the best Wentworth I've seen.  Like Hawkins, he's not bad; I loved how Penry-Jones played it when Wentworth sees Lady Russell again for the first time since she separated him and Anne.  Unfailingly polite, he does manage to convey the necessary emotions at the necessary parts.  His concern and slight panic when he discovers people expect him to offer for Louisa is well done.  Again, same problem; he was preceded by Ciaran Hinds, and it's a little bit like Macfayden attempting Darcy after Firth.

No real opinion on the script...again, liked the inclusion of the conversation where Wentworth finds out that people expect him to offer for Louisa.  I have mixed feelings about how the writer moved the Benwick-Anne conversation about how men and women love: it fits where it is in the movie, but in the book it's a key factor in Wentworth's offering again for Anne at the end.  Anne running the ""streets of Bath"" marathon - CHEESY AND DUMB.

Really liked Finlay Robertson's Benwick; I found him more memorable than Richard McCable's 1995 version.  This Benwick looked truly lovesick at the loss of his fiancee.  Alice Krige's Lady Russell was well done as well.  How she did the conversation where Lady Russell and Anne discuss Wentworth at the start of the movie was very good.  It's easy to believe that Lady Russell is really just looking out for Anne; Krige delivers all the maternal warmth while maintaining a regal bearing.  Hard to go wrong with Anthony Head as Sir Walter Elliot.

Go with the 1995 if you only want to watch one, but this is worth watching.",1218758400,,2364,4.7995049504950495

The direction is dubious at best, which I can only assume is what caused all the over- acting. There are some wonderful actors who are aren't given a chance in this version. I recommend spending your money on the Amanda Root version which is absolutely beautiful, and while you're at it, look into Elizabeth Gaskill's North and South, which just came out in dvd, and is as close to perfection as a BBC production can be, and that's saying a lot!

I have to say that I was very glad that they didn't do another version of Pride and Prejudice-nothing will ever top the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version (no matter how good Keira Knightley is). Anyway, I actually happened upon this on the second showing and was amazed. Sally Hawkins is a very gifted actress and completely makes you feel the quiet sadness and reoccuring broken heart that is Anne Eliot's. And Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Wentworth was seductivley unmoving and unfeeling--or so you are taught to believe until the steel wall around his heart begins to evaporate.

The idea of girl of the lower nobility running all over bath with out being horribly out breath is ludicrous.

2759223,5,B000N6U0VU,"I am a dedicated Janeite ... Jane is my favorite author; although I am not much of a ""chick lit chick"" Jane is comfort food. As I see her she is the original DIY Riot Grrrl who would give Kathleen Hanna a real run for her Rebel Girl money. I've read the books more times than I can think of; cut a wide swath through the literary criticism; read the few remaining letters Cassandra didn't see fit to burn, and have seen every movie adaption out there. And I agree with, I think it was EM Forester who said, ""Jane will get you out of a tight spot!""

I am not excessively critical of Austen movie adaptations as I seem to enjoy them all; I just like some better than others. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth still ""own"" Pride and Prejudice in my humble opinion ... I think it will be awhile before those two are truly unseated from their respective roles of Lizzy Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. And although there is a lot of blather about Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds being too old to play Anne Elliot and Fredrick Wentworth I heartily disagree -- they contributed wonderful performances in their Persuasion version roles, supported by the absolutely fabulous character actors Sophie Thompson who played a hilarious sister Mary and Corin Redgrave who played an equally hilarious Sir Walter Elliot.

It was with some reticence that I purchased the Sense and Sensibiity Collector Set ... but what the heck, I get three films focusing on Jane Austen, including the latest adaptation of Persuasion which is my favoriate Austen novel and an update of Sense and Sensibility thrown in for good measure.

I am truly delighted by Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot and Rupert Penry-Jones who was every bit her equal as the upwardly mobile Fredrick Wentworth. It was also really cool to see Anthony Head post ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" as the vapid, vain and mean! Sir Walter ... which is such a departure from his Giles-Buffy days. The only real complaint, albeit a picayune minor one at that, is Julia Davis, who plays Elizabeth Elliot, is wearing a really bad wig. This is a stunning adaptation and Simon Burke is to be heartily commended as is Rebecca Eaton who once again proves why she is ""The Master"" in Masterpiece Theatre! One final note: This is the BEST on-screen kiss I have EVER seen ... topping even Billy Crudup and Claire Danes in Stage Beauty! (and they were for real).",1214006400,5,2365,4.6128266033254155

I thought Rupert Penry Jones was very handsome, & Sally Hawkins was a pretty good actress as well.  I liked that even after 8 years had passed since Anne Elliott was ""persuaded"" to turn down her beau Cpt Wentworth's proposal, when they met again, they still harbored feelings for each other, even if Wentworth still felt bitter after her rejection.  I'm a real sucker for romantic movies.  This was my second favorite Jane Austen movie, my first was Pride & Prejudice, the version with Kiera Knightley & Matthew MacFadyen.

That seems kind of unladylike behavior, but in the end everything worked out.  I especially loved the ending when they married & Wentworth brought her back to her family's old home, after she had to sell it in the beginning for financial reasons.  That was very sweet!

As a matter of fact, I thought the physique of Sally Hawkins suited my imagination of Anne Elliot the best out of all 3 I have seen. Yet, the way she was directed was horrendous. She is constantly running after Captain Wentworth (and not only in the last ten minutes, what about the concert scene?). I also much preferred the older Captain Wentworth (played by Ciaran Hinds). He seemed to show a lot more emotion while still staying true to Wentworth's steely character. Finally, why on earth was this one cut so short? We hardly saw anything pass between the main 2 characters and the cousin Mr. Elliot character was just a silhouette in the background. Very odd and poorly done.",1213401600,6,829,4.4605263157894735

2759237,1,B000N6U0VU,"Persuasion is my favorite novel.  The BBC adaptation from 1995 is one of my favorite movies.  That said, I had high hopes for this adaptation.  This film did not make the best possible use of the talents of the actors cast, and it changed the story so that it doesn't make sense anymore.

RP-J was given nothing to do but smolder.  Amanda Hale's Mary was positively dreadful; she looked as if she was trying to channel Sophie Thompson and she did not succeed.  Sally Hawkins is, frankly, not attractive enough for Anne.  And, before you think I'm being shallow, I should point out that Austen's Anne is described as being a very pretty girl.  Sophy Croft is only supposed to be 8 years older than her brother Frederick, but she looks more like his aunt or his mother here.

The scene where Wentworth picks Anne up and plops her on the back of the Crofts' gig misses the point.  In the book, Anne's (and ours) reaction to that is to think that, perhaps, he still cares for her somewhat.  In this movie, it looks like he wants nothing at all to do with her.

The ""Bath Marathon"" at the end of the film was ludicrous. The fish-mouthed kiss was disgusting.  Wentworth buying Kellynch Hall for Anne is impossible (William Elliot will inherit it).  And what is with Mrs. Smith running along side Anne?  Mrs. Smith is an invalid.  Is Nurse Rooke a miracle worker?

But moving the constancy conversation from Bath to Lyme and having it be between Anne and Benwick is the biggest mistake the filmmakers made.  This change makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Wentworth is meant to hear that conversation.  It is the impetus for him to write his letter to Anne.  The first line of that letter is ""I can listen no longer in silence...""  So moving that conversation and preventing Wentworth from hearing it ruins the letter.  How they can justify ruining one of the most beautiful love letters in all of English literature is beyond me.

2759240,2,B000N6U0VU,"I was quite disappointed in this adaption of ""Persuasion"", which is by far my favorite Austen novel, but where do I start with the problems?

1.  Mary is silly and lacks the overweening need to be the center of attention and class consciousness. This version lacked those elements that made Mary stand out as an illustration of class consciousness.

2.  I adore Anthony Head but I did not think him well suited to play the Baronet. There was none of the mincing foppishness that characterizes the Baronet in the book. Instead Head is angry all the time.

3.  Anne would never run around Bath without a wrap and hat after the captain nor would she be so emotional. Anne controlled herself throughout everything, except when she stopped the captain to ask if he wouldn't stay for the concert. She also did not ask him to the concert but ran into him by his design.

Outside of the cinematography, the rearrangement of the plot was contrived and heavy on the romance without regard for the social commentary that is an integral part of Austen's books. The actors, while quite attractive, were miscast, outside of Benwick and Anne, and Anthony Head with a better script and more foppish characterization.

I was very disappointed and the 1995 version of ""Persuasion"" was much better all around. Note to director: Don't mess with perfection.",1212451200,2,1336,4.8034934497816595

I love Jane Austen so much that I'm pretty forgiving with directors changing things here and there from the book, etc. if it works in the Austen spirit of things. (I thought the quirky ""Mansfield Park"" with Frances O'Connor was charming.) But THIS movie is bad using any criteria- the women were miscast, the acting was completely off for the characters, and the ending- let's just say it was atrocious beyond description.
Am I the only one to fail to see why this handsome Wentworth would see anything in this dowdy, incessantly-hyperventilating Anne? No chemistry here whatsoever, and rightly so. Her sister Elizabeth looked old enough to be Sir Walter's wife, and Mary was never meant to be portrayed as an arguably likable character. And I will reiterate others' conclusion that this was the absolute worst on-screen kiss in the history of film. Terrible! And Kellynch was entailed away from the female line, as I recall, and being inherited by William Elliot - wasn't it impossible to break these inheritances by outside purchase? Anyway, this movie just doesn't work. Sally Hawkins as Anne just doesn't work. The '95 version with Amanda Root has its flaws but it is far superior to this, and a very satisfying adaptation.

The actor opposite her was nice to look at, but his performance is a little weak. The story is true to Jane Austen's story, so that is a plus.

Now, for the problem. This movie was too short! There were many scenes that seemed rushed and incomplete. The part of the story there is is good, but there was some important scenes left out and some things were in the wrong order. For example, at the end of the story, Ann and Wentworth's friend, Bennet, are supposed to have a conversation about the constencey of men vs. women. It is while listening to this conversation that Wentworth writes the letter informing Ann that he has never stopped loving her. However, in the movie the conversation happens much earlier and Wentworth's letter comes as a result of hearing Ann is not engaged to Mr. Elliott. I think that the movie was done this way to save time, but it does kind of mess up the story.

Overall, this movie is OK, mainly because of the acting. However, it is too short and not great. It's a good alternative, but I would stick with the 1995 version with Amanda Root.",1211932800,,1233,4.427312775330397

Anne's friend Mrs. Smith and her vital role is completely diminished and you barely even realize who she is, since she isn't an invalid in this movie either. Also one of my favorite parts of this whole story is skipped, Wentworth doesn't ever write Anne a hurried letter containing his true feelings.

2759246,4,B000N6U0VU,As an avid period drama viewer and having seen the 1995 version I am very happy with this adaptation. It was well done with the time restraints and very much possessed the romantic tension that Fredrick and Anne had. Very subtly done and developed nicely. The main characters are much lovelier than the 1995 version and Rupert Penry Jones is a dashing Fredrick. Overall I enjoyed this very much and is a treasure in my collection.,1211846400,3,430,4.671052631578948
2759247,4,B000N6U0VU,"The reviews for this movie are quite mixed. I myself loved the movie. As much as I enjoyed the version with Amanda Root, I felt it was difficult to follow. This version was much easier to follow and the characters easier to relate to. I enjoyed it immensely. I would urge anyone considering watching it to do so, then judge for themselves. I would have given it 5 stars, except for the scene in the end where Anne is seen running back and forth through Bath to meet with Capt. Wentworth. I don't believe that is true to her character. She was far too reserved for such a display of emotion, and her position in life would never have allowed it. I have not read the book, however, and maybe completely off the mark in this, but I thought the scene a bit ridiculous. As a whole, I thought the movie sweet and romantic; a charming display of chivalry, gallantry, and honor. The speech patterns to be poetic and touching and the costumes and sets rich in beauty. This is a great movie, watch it with a friend and be prepared to be left speechless for a time while you lose yourself in a different, more dignified and elegant era.",1211587200,3,1125,4.3619047619047615
2759248,5,B000N6U0VU,"This is my favorite movie. I've watched it nearly ten times in the few weeks I've owned it. I have read and appreciated all of Jane Austen's work.
Many critics site the movie's artistic liscense where it deviates from the book in particular ways. I watched an interview with the director who answered critics and literary fans of Jane Austen's cry ""Where is the rest of the book?"" with this ""It's in the book."" This film adaptation does move very quickly and has been pared down to the quintesential love story between Anne and Wentworth. For the runtime deemed suitable, characters are developed as much as possible, but being an Austen work, there are a lot of characters and withouth it being several hours long a great deal of character development is done by having to pay close attention to the conversations between characters in each scene.

This film has afforded me the opportunity to introduce Jane Austen and this particular work, often overshadowed by her others, Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility with my friends and husband, who would never think to crack open her books. For that I am profoundly grateful. This adaptation of Persuasion lies in the middle of two territories. The first being completely acurate and true to the novel and  filmed with all the conventions of Austen's time and customs honored making for a sometimes pushing the viewer to a purely auditory enjoyment and the other end of the spectrum where it has been too modernized, characters doing things unheard of the time, big grandeous high budget filming, etc.

Where in the middle it falls should be up to the viewer to decide, but it is definently worth viewing. DIe hard Austen fans should not let the deviations destroy the appreciation that Austen's work has again found a new voice in a new decade and those new to Austen or Persuasion who will no doubt enjoy the love story, scenery, and interplay between the characters just might find themselves wanting to pick up the book, and find out what all the movie left out.",1211500800,2,2024,4.777142857142858

And what's up with Wentworth buying Kellynch for her at the end?  Stick to the 1995 version -- it was tons better!",1211414400,3,432,4.890410958904109

However, part of what makes a story work is the ability to convey the character's feelings to the audience in a palpable way.  This is missing in the Root-Hinds movie.

In this newest version of Persuasion, you can sense the intensity of longing and attraction immediately between Anne and the Captain.  It chokes the air throughout the movie.  You are completely torn and frustrated as much as they are.  Frankly I found them a far more believable couple than the former.  Additionally, the rest of the movie incorporates lush sets and costuming that take us to a bygone time.

But is it too much to ask that they try to follow Jane Austen's story line?  Since it holds together?  I was going along with it until the end when I realized there's no motivation for how the characters are acting.  Because they didn't follow the story line--misplacing conversations and events.

If you aren't a huge Persuasion fan and you are a fan of costume drama, this might work for you.  But if you love the book, don't get your hopes up.  And go watch Pride and Prejudice.",1210204800,,638,4.3931623931623935

The actors did a terrific job of putting you in the moment, especially through the tension and sadness of the events.

*POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD* Perhaps the most romantic scene in the entire book is when Captain Wentworth overhears Anne speaking with Harville about men versus women forgetting their loves. Wentworth writes her a beautiful letter while surrounded by people, then goes back into the room after leaving to make sure Anne knows it is there and hers. The scene is dramatic in the sense Frederick finally expresses his feelings while in addition there is the fear of Wentworth being discovered writing a letter to Anne. In this film version, the audience has no idea where the letter is written or what exactly provoked him to write it. It was almost as if the production crew filmed everything else and realized, ""Oh yeah, we forgot the letter...let's paste that in somehow."" I also read elsewhere someone asking why Anne would be running about Bath the way she did. It seemed very out of character for Anne Elliot to be running all around looking for Wentworth.

This film was better than some of the newest BBC adaptations of Jane Austen, however as far as ""Persuasion"" goes, the 1995 film is the best one out there. This can easily be used as a compliment to the book and the 1995 film version but standing alone it's not all it should have been.",1208736000,,1517,4.656716417910448

2759290,4,B000N6U0VU,"This 2007 BBC version of ""Persuasion"" first aired in the United States in January 2008 on PBS Masterpiece Theater.  Starring Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot and Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Frederick Wentworth, it retells Jane Austen's classic romance about two people with a once and future love.

The story is familiar to Jane Austen fans.  Anne Elliot, daughter of a baronet, was persuaded at age nineteen to reject the marriage proposal of Navy Lieutenant Frederick Wentworth on the grounds that he lacked fortune.  Eight years later and still single, Anne  bitterly regrets her decision.  As her family departs its ancestral home to economize in smaller quarters in Bath, she learns that the new tenants are to be an Admiral and Mrs Croft.  Mrs Croft's brother, now-Captain Wentworth, has returned from the Napoleonic Wars wealthy with prize money and in search of a wife.

Anne is repeatedly thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, who seems interested in her two young and eligible cousins.  An accident to one of the cousins at the seaside town of Lyme causes Wentworth to take renewed notice of Anne.  Anne will be favored by the surprising courtship of an wealthy cousin, setting the stage for one last opportunity to make the right choice.

Compared with its 1995 predecessor starring Amanda Root and Ciaron Hinds, the 2007 version is shorter by a good ten minutes and has shaved the details of the storyline accordingly.  Anne's courtship by her cousin, and her relationships with her old school teacher in Bath are much abbreviated.  The climactic scene in the 1995 version, in which Anne defends women's constancy to Wentworth's mentor in the presence of Wentworth, is here played as a note sent by Wentworth that causes Anne to run breathlessly through the rainy streets of Bath to find him.

The 2008 version features an attractive cast and equally attractive location shooting. Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones have good chemistry as the two leads.  Hawkins is less stoic and more emotionally vulnerable in her portrayal than Amanda Root's much put-upon Anne.  The handsome Penry-Jones looks rather unweathered for eight years at sea, but is easily worthy of Anne's longheld love.  Anthony Stewart Head is marvellous as Anne's vain and pompous father.

""Persuasion"" is well recommended to fans of Jane Austen, who should find it entertaining and well-executed if taken on its own terms.",1207612800,,2409,5.086513994910941

2759292,5,B000N6U0VU,"I recently borrowed the Persuasion DVD to watch and I loved it even more than when I caught it on PBS, which I had enjoyed immensely.  I was very surprised & dismayed to see that the PBS version had cut out several very pivotal scenes, including declarations of love past & present.

That said, Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones were absolutely perfect in their roles, capturing quiet anguish, love, regret, strength of character.  The musical score was stirring and haunting.  The locations and costumes were magnificent and lavish.  The supporting roles of Mary, Elizabeth, and Sir Walter Elliot were excellently portrayed by the actors!  The foppishness and shallowness of Mary, the vanity, shallowness, and snobbery of Elizabeth and Sir Walter were perfection!  Even the unctuous William Elliot was well done--one can't help but cringe when he gets near.  I do agree, however, that the actress who played Elizabeth was a bit old.  And I wish that Anne Elliot weren't wearing an already-worn plain dress in the final scene.  In fact, Anne's dresses, unlike others', seemed to be cut off right above the ankles and were unflattering to her.  Anne also seemed outfitted with the flattest shoes possible, while others wore shoes or Victorian boots with a bit of heel.  I also wish her hairstyle had been softened a bit.

My favorite scene is when Anne and Captain Wentworth were first thrown together.  Anne wore a lovely dress and had a gorgeous backdrop by a window.  The heart-dropping Anne must have felt when she realized, too late, that Captain Wentworth was coming in the door.  The heart-pounding one experiences when Captain Wentworth realizes Anne is in the same room, and slowly make eye contact.

As for the final scene, yes, it wasn't very believable for the period that Anne ran all over Bath to find Captain Wentworth, and the kiss was so unflattering to Anne.  And why, oh why, didn't the production show Captain Wentworth penning his declaration of love, as in the 1995 version (which was difficult to watch because of the perceived age of the actors)?  And, until I read the reviews here, I didn't even realize the house in the final frame was Kellynch, which could not have been possible.

And even if Jane Austen hadn't written it, I kept wishing that we could have seen Anne and Frederick when they first fell in love.  The Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice was shown in three 2-hour parts on PBS(!)-- certainly, a 2-hour production of this Persuasion would have been ideal to put in more scenes and develop the characters more.",1207267200,,2550,4.856481481481482
2759293,3,B000N6U0VU,"Okay, so this is usually a two hour plus production; a mini-series, even.  To do it all in ninety minutes means a LOT of cutting.  Anyone familiar with the work -any Austen fan, in particular- knows the missing parts.  But.  First, I know they have to run the titles, but there seems to be an endless scene of Anne wandering through Kellynch hall taking inventory.  It took up time, but did zilch to move the plot forward.  The actors were quite believable and for once were as described in the book and were of the correct age onscreen. Costuming and sets were superb; filming in Bath was brilliant.  There was some serious tweaking of incident and motives, but Austen is much like Shakespeare in that it is the basic plot and the dialogue that carries the play.  But the ending . . .  a daughter, even the middle daughter, of a baronet would not be running around the streets of Bath.  There is no way she would answer to anyone calling her by her Christian name, much less stand in a public street hatless and disheveled.  And an unmarried woman to kiss a man in the public square? Puh-lease!  In case anyone has missed the point, it was once an important part of the marriage ceremony (remember that quaint charming custom?) wwhen the minister would say, ""You may now kiss the bride.""  They meant that; only in marriage would such public displayed be allowed.  They had something good going until they ""improved"" on it.  As Lady DeBourgh was won't to say, ""It is too bad!""",1207180800,5,1476,4.516981132075472

I don't know what the producers could have been thinking. They turned Anne into a weepy dishrag! And their Captain Wentworth may look nice but he doesn't look like a sailor. He looks more like a rich landowner's son who never had to do a day's hard labor in his life. He would have made a good Mr. Elliot actually. The rest of the character's in the story have been similarly skewed. And I was horrified by the changes that were made to the plot. They actually took out the most romantic scene in the whole story!

As handsome a fellow as I could ever want.  There are excellent scenes as well, such as Wentworth accompanying the carriage on horseback as they traveled to Lyme, and I enjoyed Anne communicating her thoughts to the audience by writing in her diary.

It's Austen, not perfectly done, but well enough to make me pleased to own a copy of this movie.",1206403200,,636,4.504347826086956
2759298,4,B000N6U0VU,"As with all adaptations of Jane Austen's works, this recent version of Persuasion is by no means perfect, and purists may revile it for the liberties it takes with the novel, yet it has its strengths.

Firstly, the storyline [for those unfamiliar with the plot] - Persuasion is a story of love lost & regained, of waiting [8 yrs in this case], and of constancy in feelings. Sally Hawkins plays Anne Elliott, who is at present a 27 year old spinster living with her father and oldest sister, with fond and poignant recollection of a long-ago romantic attachment that went sour. 8 years earlier, Anne had rejected a young naval officer, Frederick Wentworth [played by a very delectable Rupert Penry-Jones] under pressure from her disapproving family and godmother, Lady Russell [Alice Krige]. She finds herself at present having to leave her home, Kellynch due to the spendthrift nature of her father and sister, and learns that the family home is to be leased to none other than Wentworth's sister and brother-in-law. Soon, Anne's and Frederick's paths cross, and his improved fortunes make him a good catch causing Anne much anguish as she realises that society's conventions prevent her from declaring her true feelings for him, whilst watching other women fawn over him. The rest of the story deals with what happens to Anne and Frederick.

As for the adaptation - the casting is very credibly done. In the 1995[?] version starring Amanda Roots [as Anne Elliott] and Ciaran Hinds [as Frederick Wentworth], I felt the two leads were too old for their roles, though well-played. In the latest version, Sally Hawkins not only looks the part age-wise but reveals the depth of her emotions very well, portraying with a glance or a look what she cannot say with words. Similarly, Penry-Jones makes a dashing Naval Captain, and his eyes convey so very much! One of the scenes that have stayed with me is the scene where he watches intently whilst Anne plays the piano -his eyes are absolutely riveted upon Anne and you wonder at the depth of his feelings [whilst also pondering -is he reviled by her for her past rejection of him, or as in love with her as he was 8 years ago?].

The other actors do a credible job with their roles as well - Alice Krige as the meddlesome Lady Russell, Anthony Head as the vain and snobbish Sir Walter etc.

The music and cinematography aptly evoke the sense of the time and places. Scenes of Bath, Lyme etc are beautifully portrayed, as is the countryside.

However, my one real grouse with this adaptation is the last couple of minutes of this version - poor Anne Elliott is shown throwing caution and notions of propriety to the wind, and running about town looking for Frederick Wentworth! It is just unimaginable, and though I get the sense this was deliberately done to show the urgency of Anne's situation and fragile state of mind, I felt it was overdone and in bad taste [in this i much preferred the more moderate scene in the '95 version].

But, all in all, I did like this version on the whole, and felt that it was a well-made, and well-acted production worthy of Austen fans [except perhaps purists, for obvious reasons] ,and also fans of period dramas.",1206316800,5,3195,4.727109515260323
2759299,3,B000N6U0VU,"Overall, a good version. However, the scene in Bath at the end when Anne and Capt. Wentworth acknowledge their love for each other is poorly done. It's not the actors, but the camera angle. Still worth the price for Austen fans.",1206316800,,228,4.585365853658536
2759300,1,B000N6U0VU,"I agree with ""Eileen"" who has not read the Austen stories, but knows all the films. She gave one star and so do I, only because I was able to watch it through...just.
  I , in contrast, have read the stories, and Persuasion is my favourite. Watching this new abridged and adapted version, I had to wonder why MT bothered at all. The feeling of the piece in no way evokes the intimacy of the story. It has a remote tableau-esque objectivity, jarringly punctuated with overwrought carryings on. The hyperventilating panic-attack characterisation of Anne is terribly distracting.
I too recommend the Ciaran Hinds/Amanda Root version, which truly portrays the fine subtlety ,intimate poignancy, and reserved intensity which are so vital to the fabric and feel of Austen's original story.",1206230400,7,783,5.062015503875969

2759302,4,B000N6U0VU,"Finally, a marvelous, intriguing portrayal of this suspenseful, popular Austen classic. I am so thankful that the actors captured the essence of her complex and honorable characters. Penry-Jones is incredibly handsome, but plays the part with such subtle intensity and passion--those eyes say it all. At first, I wasn't sure I liked the director's choice to have Anne look directly into the camera to connect with the viewer, however, after watching it several times, I think it was a wise, modern choice. It allows us a peek into her soul and what she's really thinking, as Austen might have directed her to do. Bravo! I really recommend this DVD version of this classic piece.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persuasion/dp/B000YIGNKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persuasion</a>",1206144000,2,820,6.017094017094017

2759305,1,B000N6U0VU,"Let me state up front that I have never read Jane Austen's novels but I've watched almost every version of her novels put to film.  I was confused in places when I watched for the first time the 1995 version of Persuasion with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root, but a second viewing clarified -- and I've watched and loved it many times since (however, I've mused that this version would have been even better than it already is had Andrew Davies written the screenplay).  I love to watch the subtle play of emotions on the characters' faces, which reveal the thoughts and feelings people of that era would never utter aloud.  I was so looking forward to watching Rupert Penry Jones' Captain Wentworth in this new rendition of Persuasion because I loved him in his small but memorable role in the excellent film, Charlotte Gray.  But I was disappointed in the entire production, especially in the casting of plain Sally Hawkins.  I would never for a moment believe that Penry Jones would be attracted to, never mind pine for, her.  I was also disappointed in Penry Jones' rather wooden performance (though I think he had the deck stacked against him by the screenplay and the way this film was shot).  I found the final scene of Hawkins running through the streets ridiculous and her way-too-long-lead-up-to-a-kiss with Wentworth contrived.  A second watch did not change my assessment of this film.  What most disturbed me about it and the other new film versions of the Austen novels released this season (Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey, although I thought Northanger Abbey the best of the three; I haven't seen Sense and Sensibility or Emma yet) is that everything feels forced -- the action is too fast and ""choppy."" Sally Hawkins is plopped onto the back of the carriage like a sack of potatoes, versus the subtle caress of Ciaran Hinds' hands on Amanda Root's waist as he helps her into the carriage, followed by the embarrassed expression on her face as she looks back at him and as he turns away to hide the caring his action revealed.  Time and time again in the 1995 version, you can see the subtle emotions on the characters' faces because the camera lingers appropriately.  This is only one of countless moments of genuine feeling that is totally lacking in this new version.  Is it that we're losing in our increasingly fast-paced results-oriented world -- reflected in many current films -- the ability to let life and feeling unfold according to its own natural rhythms?  I was not persuaded that the characters in this new version were real at all.",1205625600,5,2564,4.760722347629796
2759306,4,B000N6U0VU,"This remake has great production quality and an excellent cast. Rupert Penry Jones is perhaps the most dashing Wentworth I've ever seen (despite lack of uniform). The biggest disappointment is the script. Events have been shuffled around which takes away some of the nuances of the characters' behavior. I don't mind seeing a new angle but this version lacked cohesion and flow. Worst is the rewrite of the final 10 minutes. Wentworth's final letter to Anne is one of the most inventive scenes by Austen, but here it's been replaced by events which seem so contrived. You'll know what I mean.

After watching the 1995 version of Persuasion, I must say that I am very disappointed in this recent take. Although I wish the 1995 actors were as handsome as those portrayed in the 2007 version, the 1995 adaptation is much more fluid and romantic. The actors portray the characters very well and look natural.

Although the cinematography is better in the 2007 version, it seemed very stilted and focused more on the facial expressions of each actor rather than the actual storyline. I feel it is rushed and disjointed. The music is a bit dramatic and the acting is overdone.

If you are interested in purchasing this film and have not seen it yet, I highly suggest you rent it first (along with the 1995 version) and come to your own conclusion. I am glad I did not purchase it in haste.",1204675200,3,906,4.552147239263804

I could barely stay awake through the boring and uneventful dialouge, the way it dragged through each scene like a snail and whoever complained about her running through the streets at the end being the only bad part was crazy. This whole movie was slow, poorly casted and all-in-all a complete flop. Have you not seen Pride and Prejudice? Becoming Jane? The Inheritance?

Anne was perhaps Jane's ideal woman, yet this screenplay makes her a pathetic silly woman and it's quite hard to believe her capable of attracting anyone's interest, or maintaining it over a span of many years. Too bad we can't hear Jane's critique of this adaptation. I'm sure it would be quite caustic.",1204588800,4,578,4.5673076923076925

He did a great job at being steamy and intent... but the whole production was disappointing.  If you want a better adaptation see the 1995 with Amanda Root and Ciar&aacute;n Hinds.

2759320,4,B000N6U0VU,"Persuasion is the story of a second chance at love.  The two main characters are meeting again years after a painful breakup. Much of the dramatic appeal comes from the fact that the friends and family surrounding them seem oblivious to the pain each is suffering. This BBC production is only an hour and a half long, which obviously means it has to leave some details from the book out (and actually changes a couple of points).
  I own three different versions of Persuasion and I love this one because of the passion shown between the two characters, but it is the one farthest from the actual classic novel by Jane Austen.  However, it is definitely worth the money for the high entertainment value.",1204416000,2,703,4.645161290322581
2759321,5,B000N6U0VU,"I know many complain about this movie and I can understand where the complaints come from. The movie is shorter and has a more modern twist to it (especially where she runs back and forth in the last scene...that was kind of funny). But throughout the entire movie (due to directing, acting, music, everything) I felt the emptiness, the desperateness of Anne. And when Wentworth realized he may have to marry Louisa, I really felt from the actor the sense of fear, to be entraped, and how in one moment he had lost everything...if only he had not been so careless and sieze the day with Anne.

So even though this particular one did not follow the book word for word, I felt it really portrayed the emotions and frustrations of the characters and the director and all the actors conveyed the entire story very well. I think you have to separate the book from the movie-making and just enjoy the story and how the movie brings you into that world.

The six hour BBC version of Pride and Prejudice and the 2005 Pride and Prejudice (with Kiera Knightley) I both enjoy. They each have their own style and give a different experience to the viewer. I think this 2007 Persuasion is similar in this sense. I hope you guys enjoy it.",1204329600,2,1224,4.509009009009009

I'm a big time fan of Jane Austen's but I'm not a purist and not only am I very willing to be pleased but I'm also very aware of how difficult it must be for a screen writer not to inject his own ideas whether good or bad into a screen play.

I instantly developed a crush for Rupert Penry Jones' Captain Wentworth and a great deal of sympathy for Sally Hawkins' Anne Elliot.

The 1995 adaptation was pretty great except I never bought Ciaran Hinds or Amanda roots as the leads despite them being excellent actors because they were simply too old. So in a perfect world I would be able to take the leads from this adaptation and switch them with the leads from the 1995 adaptation.

The film would've been perfect if they screen writer had not taken creative liberties at all but alas that could not be. Still I highly recommend it as long as you are prepared to overlook a few very silly changes to the story and a few miss casted actors.",1204156800,3,1021,4.252577319587629
2759324,5,B000N6U0VU,"To those who find the thought of a well bred lady running through the streets of Bath during the Jane Austen period incomprehensible, I recommend that we look to someone with an irrefutable knowledge of the time period. Jane Austen herself. In her book Northanger Abbey chapter 13, Thorpe has canceled an engagement Catherine Morland made with the Tilneys without her consent. In order to set the matter right she ""walked in great agitation, as fast as the crowd would permit her."" Nearing her destination ""she nearly ran over the remaining ground till she gained the top of Milsomstreet.""

I found it perfectly reasonable that after eight years of separation and with the prospect of her not being able to express to Captain Wentworth the depth of her feelings before he left, Anne Eliot might indeed run to find him. Granted, this is an artistic license on the screenwriters part that is not in the book but one that I found believable and well acted.

I enjoyed this version immensely. Considering that they managed to condense the book into 93 minutes without losing the essense of the story was remarkable (though I would have preferred a longer movie so that some of the minor characters could have been more fleshed out and more details shown). I think it greatly improved upon the 1995 version which suffered from having older cast members (Anne Eliot should have been about 26 while Amanda Root looked to be in her 30's), a confusing script (it was hard to understand in the beginning and viewers who had not read the book were confused ie. my dad), some poor acting (Amanda Root's Anne seemed very timid and rather pathetic and it was hard for me to root for her and Wentworth),and slow pacing.  Though the 1995 version has merit and I enjoy it, I would definitely recommend this version over it.",1203984000,10,1806,4.726984126984127
2759325,4,B000N6U0VU,"to highly esteem this adaptation of Persuasion. My only prior experience with Persuasion was the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which at the time I found rather boring, and because I hadn't read the novel, somewhat hard to follow. Also, Ciaran Hinds isn't my idea of a leading man, although I liked him as Mr. Rochester in Jane Eyre. He ""is tolerable I suppose, but not handsome enough to tempt me.""

I do enjoy British period drama and was pleased that PBS would be airing a number of remakes of the classics. When I watched this most recent version of Persuasion on Masterpiece, my reactions were similar to some of the negative reviewers who commented on the camera work, especially the way ""Anne"" looked directly at the audience.

However, based on the positive reviews which mentioned that the DVD contained scenes not included in the PBS version, I decided to buy it. I have watched it a number of times, and it certainly improves with further viewing. I enjoy Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones as Anne and Captain Wentworth. Their performances are subtle and moving, and most of the other actors are agreeable as well. I especially enjoy the music which highlights the particularly emotional scenes.

I have since read the novel and rewatched the 1995 version and have come to appreciate this newest adaptation for what it is. Although not wholly faithful to the novel or the mores of the time, it stands on its own merit as an enjoyable story about being given a second chance at love.",1203724800,3,1513,4.745247148288973

I have read the book as well. I really like the main actor and actress in this version. He is very handsome and his long, sad glances at Anne are enough to make you ache for him. My favorite scene was when he first sees her in Bath and tells her: "" ... He ought not. He does not."" Perfect.

Sally Hawkins is wonderful, and - unlike some of the other reviewers - I thought she was very attractive. Perfect for the Anne Elliott character, her beauty was subtle and grew on you with time. Her inner beauty (sweetness, character) made her more outwardly beautiful as the story progressed. I was very moved by the scenes in which she was writing in her journal and looking directly at the audience, so I don't understand why some people have disliked that so much. It worked for me! I especially liked the scene when she is anticipating the dinner with the Crofts. Her spoken journal entry is very poetic, moving and helps the viewer to understand what she is thinking and feeling.

I also disagree with the reviewers who said she was whiny or that she just ran to her room and cried all of the time. Not true! Her strong, capable character is revealed in so many ways throughout the movie: She took care of her father's house. She saved them from being in even worse financial trouble. She took care of her sister, even though Mary was very annoying and not really sick. She took care of her nephew when his own mother didn't want to be troubled. She was a favorite of the Musgroves and of the Crofts and of Lady Russell. She was loyal to her old poor schoolfriend, even when her family disapproved. Her father's solicitor said she was the only daughter with any sense. She took care of Louisa after the fall. She graciously leaves when Mary insults her. etc. etc.

I have watched this version several times. I wish the ending weren't so rushed and I wish the kissing scene in Bath was more flattering for the actress, but I admire the way the director was able to edit the movie down to such a short duration but still include all of the essentials to tell a very moving story.

No respectable woman of that time period would ever carry on that way in public, let alone in private.  In addition, there is a ridiculous 5 minute unrequited kiss that is absurd!

Watching this film is like substituting your freshman English notes for the actual novel. It hits the highlights but doesn't slow down enough to make anything dramatic or memorable. If you liked the Keira Knightley version of _Pride & Prejudice_, you might like this film, too, since the two share similar strengths and weaknesses.

You will sense something is ""off"" even if you've never read the book. The film doesn't go far enough in originality to compensate for its shoddy treatment of the source. Things move quickly but, at the same time, lack suspense.

Too bad that the director / cinematographer failed to give his character more weight by providing more camera time.  Instead, they focused on Anne's character that was blandly acted.

I agree with the rest of the critics regarding the ending of the film where Anne was running all over Bath looking for Capt Wentworth.  It could have given more thought so that their interpretation of the novel would still contain Jane Austen's meaning by being more artistic and retaining its essence without being ridiculous which what has been done on this film.

Rupert Perry -Jones was excellent as captain Wentworth and the chemistry between the two of them seemed more real in this film version.

We also like the actors for Anne and Captain Wentworth better. This new adaptation is my (and my family's) absolute favorite version of 'Persuasion'! :)

On more thing.. if you saw this film on PBS and found it choppy or confusing, there is a reason!  There were several scenes cut out of the movie when it was shown on TV.  Some of them are short, but a few are longer and they really help the movie flow better! Some parts that were a little unclear when we watched it on TV now make much more sense since  we saw the WHOLE film on DVD!!

2759341,5,B000N6U0VU,"If you loved the new Pride & Prejudice with Keira Knightly as a Pride & Prejudice fan then you will love this version of Persuasion. It does include some things in the movie that is not in the book and it also changes some things making them not exactly right but it's nothing really worth complaining about. Overall, it is still a really great movie and because the leading actors work so well together, it makes up for the lack of faithfulness to the book.",1202515200,2,458,4.4
2759342,1,B000N6U0VU,"I believe this must be the worst adaptation ever made of ""Persuasion.""  (I know of no competition for the distinction.)  I give it one star because it is not possible to award none.  It is as though scriptwriter Simon Burke knew and worked from an exceedingly abridged version of the novel.  He turned Austen's characters into sticks.  Her carefully depicted relationships among them and the equally careful mechanics of her plot aren't here.  For example, Captains Harville and Benwick are reduced to ciphers and their part in Austen's central consideration of whether men or women are faithful longer is obliterated, and her use of a pivotal discussion of the subject as a means to bring Anne and Wentworth together is absent.  Again, what Mrs. Smith has to tell Anne about William Elliot must be a mystery to anyone who doesn't know the novel.  In fact, her role in this version is so marginal that it would have been better to cut it altogether since her only significance in the story (as opposed to helping to show an aspect of Anne's character, which is also pretty much missing) is what she has to tell about Elliot.  Further, Burke either knows nothing or chooses to ignore the social mores of the time, most flagrantly in the concluding sequence of Anne chasing Wentworth through the streets of Bath, which is utterly preposterous.  Finally, Wentworth could not buy Kellynch as a wedding present for Anne; the estate is entailed and could not be sold by Sir Walter.
  Given the script and the hole-in-the-corner production, it may not be fair to judge the cast too much, but what we get is not very good.  Sally Hawkins's Anne certainly does not ""bloom,"" and she doesn't show behavior that makes the viewer accept her as always the best person to deal with a situation.  Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Wentworth mostly pouts.  Neither he nor Peter Wight as Admiral Croft looks as though he'd ever been to sea in so much as a rowboat.  (In fact, the whole naval background of the novel is mostly ignored.)  Julia Davis as Anne's supposedly ""beautiful"" older (by only two years) sister looks (and behaves) more like a middle-aged stepmother.  Tobias Menzies has nothing of the oily deviousness of William Elliot.  The only cast member who really looks the part is Sarah Buckland as Nurse Rooke, but she is used here only as set decoration rather than an important source of information for Anne.  Anthony Head is a passable Sir Walter Elliot.
  There seems to be no 100% satisfactory adaptation of ""Persuasion"" available.  The two contenders are an adaptation by Julian Mitchell from Granada TV in 1971 and one by Nick Dear from  the BBC and WGBH in 1995.  The Mitchell comprises five 60-minute episodes and, therefore, includes much more detail from the novel.  The Dear has a much stronger cast and production.  Its 104-minute running time is a far better adaptation of the original than the new Burke although it runs only 11 minutes longer.  The Dear also has Anne doing several things that would not have been possible at the time, but they are much less egregious than in the Burke.  I suggest you get both -- the Mitchell (for completeness) and the Dear (for the best production) and leave the Burke to sink from sight as quickly as possible.",1202428800,34,3256,4.764285714285714

2759344,5,B000N6U0VU,"I saw this adaptation a few weeks ago on PBS in the USA, and I was very impressed by it. The casting for the two leads was so complimentary, each achieving a sense of the loss of a great love, and the chance for fulfillment eight years later. They were of the appropriate ages to match Jane Austen's lead characters.

I taped the film, but it appeared very grainy, so I decided to order the DVD which arrived today. What a contrast and a delight. The colors, costumes and sets are wonderful. Also, I was able to view the entire production which includes several scenes which greatly enhanced the understanding of the story and the passing of time between the various episodes.

Particularly I enjoyed the clear delineation between the attitudes of Anne's family and that of the Musgroves regarding to social status. Fredericks' anguish over being continually degraded at every encounter with the snobby sisters and father of Anne were very apparent. It all made the story seem more real; the reason for all the sorrows and disappointments stemming from Anne's family's social status and their overbearing sense of entitlement and superiority.

In the end, I breathed a sigh of relief for the lovers finally together at last.",1202342400,2,1224,4.84688995215311
2759345,3,B000N6U0VU,"Not only was Anne Eliot running all over Bath totally out of character and unnecessary to the story, the fairy tale ending of Wentworth bringing her back to her childhood estate was totally impossible.  He could not have afforded to buy it or maintain it on what he would have made in the war. And the character in the book would have been happy in a much smaller place.

I've seen this a few times. Although the 1995 Amanda Root version is much better, this has some charms. They had to compress parts of the plot to fit the 90 minutes.  That I could have accepted if the ending had been true. There was no reason to make Anne run through the streets ! That detracts from the entire production.

Sally Hawkins gave a sensative portrayal, but the Anne of the book was stronger.",1202342400,2,777,4.375
2759346,2,B000N6U0VU,"Attractive actors, sets, costumes and a great score, but outside of those elements a veritable disappointment!  The film does not portray the characters in a way that is consistent with Austen's own depiction.  Anne is whiny and timid.  Wentworth is inarticulate and, at one point, actually confused to find that he has been flirting with Luisa Musgrove.  The Crofts, sensible and smart in other versions, are similarly confused and bland in this one.
Austen would never have countenanced a heroine of hers running a marathon around Bath because she can't master her feelings or a pround hero who gives in so easily. . .she might enjoy certain scenes and scenery in the movie but she would not have recognized this film as her own story.",1202342400,6,737,4.872

I saw it on Masterpiece Theatre on PBS.  Unlike the other Austin productions I've seen on Masterpiece Theatre (Northanger Abbey, Mansfield Park), I felt this movie rather than watched it. Here is Anne, confronted by her lost love, watching him court another woman right in front of her.  Here she is, unable to reveal that she still loves Captain Wentworth, about to loose him again.  Sally Hawkins portrayed Anne in such a heartfelt way, I'm touched every time I see the movie.  I thought the movie was well done, the score beautiful, and oh, how I sympathized with Anne.  I can't say if this Persuasion is better than the book, or better than any other production of it, but I really enjoyed it as it was.",1202342400,4,885,4.515723270440252

Captain Wentworth is amazing , and Anne is wonderful. although some people complain about how they don't want to know ahead of time what C.W . is feeling - I loved it - it's great to see some emotion. The 1995 adaptation is true to the book, but it is so cold. In the book, Jane tells us in words things that the 1995 actors just don't carry through in actions. So it's nice to see a Captain Wentworth who loves Anne, the scene where Captain Wentworth confides in Captain Harville is awesome, and the scene where he lifts her onto the carriage is so touching. All in all, a lush and wonderful adaptation.",1202083200,5,743,4.2027972027972025
2759349,4,B000N6U0VU,"I first have to state that I haven't yet read the novel. I own it - but haven't read it. I am however, a HUGE fan of Ms. Austen's works and the films based upon her works. And I'm a huge fan of the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.

I LOVE this more recent version - and it may surpass the other in my heart. The main reason is that I believe that the choices made to give the viewer a clearer and deeper understanding of the backstory, past events, and other histories of other characters work tremendously well in emphasizing the pain that each of the leads is going through. For example, no matter how many times I'd seen the 1995 version I had NO idea that Anne had actually been engaged to Frederick and then broke it off. I merely thought that she'd let herself be courted and then refused him. It wasn't made clear. It is very clear in this newer version that guilt and pain that Anne carries is tied to her betrayal as well as why Frederick would try so desperately to ignore her and perhaps hurt her by courting [or giving the appearance of courting] for one for of the Musgrove girls.

I also like seeing more of Frederick's side of things in conversations with his best friend Harvell. I like receiving a more descriptive insight just to the true character of William Elliot and his desire to be a baronet. I though that the 2 leads had fantastic chemistry and Anthony Head brought an interesting menace to his foppish role. Elizabeth Elliot was miscast - she was too old and not pretty enough. Why could they not find Rosamund Pike - who was so perfectly cast as Jane in the 2005 version of P&P? She would have been wonderful I believe!

****SPOILER ALERT!!****

I know many have issues with the changes of the delivery of the letter, the conversation with Harvell and the constancy of men vs. women, as well as Anne desperately looking for Frederick. I however, do not. I loved the way they were handled in 1995 of course - but still enjoy and love how our lovers get together in the end. And while I understand that readers are shocked to see that they would show Anne - a lady of elegance - running down several streets; I think it only adds to the determination and passion that Anne is feeling for not letting her second chance at happiness slip away. In fact it added to their reconciliation for me - and brought me to tears. It is a huge moment for Anne. She is chasing after her future - freeing herself from the miserable life in which she thought she was due based upon her prior actions. She is showing the world that she completely willing to flaunt convention and follow her heart and mind rather than ever be led or persuaded against otherwise again. So bravo!

Again - there are some changes. But I do not think the changes hurt the story - for me they do add to it. I am quite happy to have both versions ans love them both.",1202083200,5,2866,4.329608938547486

I own the 1995 Amanda Root/Ciarin Hinds version and truth be told, it took me a few viewings to get used to Ciarin Hinds, but now, forgetting his perceived age, I like him. Amanda Root, I always did like, especially because of the common sense and propriety she brought to the role. Her second bloom that occurred later in this version was simply splendid.

This ITV version is quite shocking for me. In some parts it reminded me of an earlier version of Mansfield Park where Fanny kept speaking into the camera. The Anne of this version did likewise, and it was very annoying. While Captain Wentworth's personal beauty was more appealing in this version, there was something lacking still in his performance. In fact, this entire version lacked a certain something. But I think the biggest CRINGE worthy moment for me was Anne running through the streets of Bath. That was quite shocking. No matter how many times I've seen it, I still cringe.

Sorry, but I'll stick to my 1995 version until, perhaps, in the future Persuasion is re-done in the true spirit of Jane Austen.",1201910400,10,1239,4.678899082568807

Sally Hawkin's is youthful but she never achieved a modicum of loveliness, there was no change in her look from beginning to end.

2759358,4,B000N6U0VU,"I have watched all of the film adaptations of Persuasion, and this one does lack in certain areas, but is magnificent in others; mainly the set colors, costumes, locations, music score and casting.  I would agree with an earlier reviewer that Elizabeth was miscast (old looking), and Mary Musgrove makes me want to vomit, although she is meant to be shallow and irritating, so she probably is cast well upon further consideration. Other reviewers compare the 1995 Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds version which was I think better than this version, but it also had many annoying cast members; Hinds is too old to play Wentworth, Root looks a bit too old, but her acting makes up for it, Clay and most of the Musgrove daughters are irritating and ugly. Elizabeth is not very pretty either, but her acting was great!)  For this version I was put off by Anne Elliot running through the street at first as well,.... although after watching it twice more I appreciated the director/etc.. attempting to capture Anne's feelings that she cannot get to Capt Wentworth fast enough to accept him since she thought that NEVER would she get another chance in life at happiness with him.  (I would run for my life to him as well!)  For those who are comparing the 95 Root version, I do recall Root running out of the concert in hot pursuit of Wentworth, which did not happen in the book and would not have happened, but it seems to be forgiven here by other reviewers.  Either way, Rupert Penry-Jones is a bit reserved, but dashing and gorgeous,(Move over Colin Firth, I have a new favorite!) and Sally Hawkins is perfect as well as Anne, she has a beautiful voice.  She really does capture Anne's internal turmoil and sadness well in her tone and expressions.  I would highly recommend this as well as the new Mansfield Park in spite of the deficiencies, other aspects of the films more than make up for what they lack, and I am always grateful for a fresh new adaptation of any of Austen's novels.",1201651200,13,1977,4.64756446991404

2759360,4,B000N6U0VU,"While I enjoyed this adaptation of Persuassion, epsecially the performances of the 2 lead characters (Anne Elliot & Captain Wentworth), it still lacked in comparison to the 1995 version starring Amanda Root & Cieran Hinds.  That version is well rounded with fabulous performances by the main characters as well as the supporting cast and is delightful from start to finish. This version left a little to be desired. I have broken down my issues with this version to 3 key points.

1. While I felt the performances of Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones were excellent and carried the movie, I was extermely dissapointed in the supporting cast, in particular Sir Walter Elliot and Elizabeth Elliot.  I also felt that Mary Musgrove was completely unlikable where as in the book she has a few tolerable moments that soften her a little bit.  Also, I recall Mrs. Clay being mentioned multiple times in the book as not being ""handsome.""  If my memory is correct, I would say the person they cast as Mrs. Clay was entirely too beautiful for the role.  I think one of the enjoyable things about Mrs. Clay in the book is that you can't figure out what would attract Mr. Elliot to her other than just trying to keep her away from Sir Walter.

2. The last 10 mintues - from reading other reviews people either loved or hated this part.  I for one hated it.  The way it was filmed just made me dizzy and it felt like a big departure from the book (even though the basis of the story was there).  I also missed the idea of seeing the reaction of Anne's family when they announce their engagement which always brings a smile to my face.

3. The use of Mrs. Smith in the last 10 mintues - While I think it was admirable for the movie makers to try to include her character in with the uncovering of Mr. Elliot's true character, it didn't fit when they had cut out all the back story of the past involving Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Smith's husband.  How did she come across this information?  Also, if she is a poor, sickly widow why is she out in the streets of Bath looking for Anne?  It just didn't add up in my mind.

Overall, this version was well made and the performances of the 2 lead charcters make it worth watching, it just didn't have that special spark to make me like it better than the 1995 version.",1201651200,3,2294,4.428571428571429

I had the pleasure of catching this movie 2 weeks ago on PBS I missed the first half but caught the second and what grab me was the wonderful acting the way the feels of the characters we so beautifully played.

In fact one of my favorite scenes is of Anne running thru the streets to finally catch up to the man who she so obviously is in love with. It's a funny moment and conveys a reality to the situation.

This movie is for those who like to see Jane Austen infused with emotion the feelings are what make this film shine above all others. Anne's poignant looks into the camera are priceless! Pride and Prejudice was my favorite until now.

BTW the music is a major player in this movie rent the DVD and listens as the music during the DVD menu starts of soft and quiet and than builds to a loud crescendo! And you will understand what the film maker is trying to convey!",1201651200,4,1143,4.3023255813953485

-------------------------

The High Points

- The scenery and costumes are amazing. Filming on location in Bath added so much to the film, and that counts for at least one star on its own.

- The score is beautiful. There is a subtle and pervasive yearning in the soundtrack that perfectly suits the story.

- While no actor will completely satisfy a true Austen fan, the two leads do an excellent job of showing us the tortured desire that their characters experience. Plus, they're both gorgeous.

-------------------------

The Low Points

- Many secondary characters and side plots of the novel are under-developed in this version. EVERYONE should anticipate this... they only had an hour and a half, folks.

- Yes, Anne has a headless turkey moment of panic and runs through Bath like a crazy woman. If you are expecting it, it won't be so bad. The director decided to go for emotion instead of accuracy, and, if you let yourself become emotionally involved with this version, it CAN be forgiven.

- What can't be forgiven, however, is that final fish kiss. Here is the moment we've all been waiting for, and it just turns out really awkward. I think the fault lies with the director on this one.

-------------------------

So the biggest problems happen in the last few minutes of the movie. As upsetting as they are, DON'T let them stop you from experiencing (and appreciating) all of the great things in this version. Although it's considerably different from the novel, the film DOES express the longing and romance that Austen described.

I was hoping that the stories would each be shown in several episodes to allow for character and plot development. What a sad, sad disappointment this adaptation was. No one who hasn't read the novel and/or seen the 1995 version would understand from *this* version why Persuasion has so many devoted fans. While the misinterpretation of Anne could partly be blamed on Ms. Hawkins' choices, the bulk of the missteps of this production are due to poor adapting and directing.

I enjoyed this movie very much.  The musical score is beautiful, and adds great depth to the story.  Costumes and locations also draw viewers into the story period.  Although not an ""Austen purist"", I have read ""Persuasion"" and I own most of the various film adaptations of her novels, including the previous version of ""Persuasion"" starring Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.

Comparing the two DVDs, I find that, while the earlier version of ""Persuasion"" may more exactly align to the book and is a wonderful movie, this newer adaptation has an updated approach that allows viewers to more closely engage with the characters, especially with Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth.  Sally Hawkins plays Anne Elliot as a well-born Englishwoman who loves her family, close friends and home with such depth that she accedes to their disapproval of her attachment at 19 to as yet unproven young naval officer Frederick Wentworth and breaks off her engagement.  The movie picks up 8 yrs later when Captain Wentworth has made his fortune in the Navy and returns to the area where Anne sees him again through his interaction with her extended family and friends.

In this 2007 movie version I better understood the relationship between Wentworth and Anne.  I felt Anne's grief and regret at losing through her own choice what she later realized was her best chance for happiness, loving him still and forced to watch him being pursued by others.  I recognized Wentworth's anger and resentment at being dumped as a young man because of his ""station""; his pride smarting at the continued denigration he experienced from Anne's supercilious family and close friend Lady Russell.  I saw his fascination with Anne despite all this, his inability to love or marry another because of her.  In Rupert Penry-Jones' portrayal of Captain Wentworth, you sense that he is constantly aware of Anne both in and out of her actual presence.  There is also a fuller realization of his own culpability in the events that transpire due in part to his own behavior. In his initial desire to prove his indifference to Anne, he himself is the one that nearly derails a second chance at happiness.

The ending scenes are what I found most expanded from the novel.  While Anne's racing around Bath on foot to find Wentworth was perhaps unusual, it is in keeping with her determination to seize her happiness despite any obstacles.  Though she deals graciously in her own sweet way with interruptions along the way, her absolute determination to reach Wentworth is very evident.  The scene where she responds to his proposal has got to be one of the most intensely filmed, yet innocent, love scenes in recent memory.  Sally Hawkins' whole demeanor - her eyes, body language - as she tells Wentworth in period language that she'll marry him was absolutely stunning.  In the final scene, there was a certain justice in Anne receiving from Wentworth the home she loved and had tried so hard to maintain despite her family's spendthrift ways.

All in all, a great movie and refreshing take on a classic period novel.",1201219200,28,3104,4.934615384615385

The acting was fine I suppose, if not bland. And the ending was just so sudden and awkward. I agree with the reviews that mentioned the running around scene, and agree that NO proper woman of that era would ever do that. Just very awkward.",1201219200,2,410,4.337662337662338

This movie reminds me of the 2006 Kira Knightly version of Pride and Prejudice, it doesn't go strictly to the book but it is a wonderful movie. I loved it! The new ending was surprising but I LOVED it.

I would recommend this book to someone who has just entered the Jane Austen world. If you haven't read the book, I will warn you most of it doesn't go to the book but you  WILL enjoy it.

For those Jane Austen fanatics like myself, sadly it doesn't go strictly to the book's plot. It focuses mostly on the main characters, Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot. If these brief descriptions have turned you off well that's your choice, but it is an excellent movie.

For those who love Jane Austen but aren't so obsessive you will LOVE THIS MOVIE! You can tell how much I love this movie by how many times I've said love; if you were one of those people who counted, yes I said it 6 times!

I hope this review was helpful and you will buy this movie. If you like it, keep it and if you don't, you can always sell it. Buy it, I'm persuaded you will enjoy this film.",1201132800,3,1200,4.2
2759373,5,B000N6U0VU,"Our family owns and has viewed each of the prior adaptations of Persuasion a number of times. It is my favorite Jane Austen novel. I love it.

However for a 21st Century audience the prior adaptations are simply too slow paced, oblique, and period bound to fully hold their attention. Here Simon Burke (the screenplay adapter) has done a masterful job of speeding the pace and unraveling the understated underlying emotions motivations and thoughts of the main characters (Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot in particular) without compromising the intent of the source novel.

Even though I know the story intimately I was on pins and needles throughout. At times the suspense was nearly unbearable. As a result, this is now my favorite screen version of this classic novel.

As to the imbalanced reviews of my fellow Jane Austen aficionados who ravaged this production simply because it fails to tightly adhere to the original manuscripts of our most beloved 19th Century Authoress - and to borrow from William Shatner's entreaty to similarly obsessed Star Trek fans - I  would simply say, ""Get a life!""

Frankly the elitist, exclusive attitude of those in the ""purist"" camp of Jane Austen fandom is wearing thin.  The works of other classic authors (Shakespeare, Dickens, the Bront sisters, etc.) have been reinterpreted throughout the ages for stage and film to make the work more relevant to their contemporary audience so I'm puzzled as to why the fans of Austen felt that her work would somehow be exempted.  Further, now that the work of Miss Austen is riding a wave of media popularity bordering on ""Rock Star"" status such interpretations are  inevitable - expect to see a lot more of this folks!

As for the rest of you dear readers I would merely add, get it and watch it - you'll love it. Then double your pleasure by reading the book too.",1201132800,11,1849,4.844444444444444

I found it hard to follow parts of the story, although I know it well, because what I felt to be key ""links"" and parts were left out or glossed over. I still feel that, of all the versions I have have seen, the 1995-1996 version with Amanda Root is far more of an accurate and honest adaptation.

I was excited at the prospect of all the new Austen versions, knowing of course that they would all be different from previous versions -to be expected, and as always the case with book to movie adaptations, different from the book in ways as well.

With all that said, I got my copy of Persuasion and sat down with an open mind. It is a slightly different look at the story with the central focus being on Anne and Captain Wentworth. Just like in the 2005 Pride and Prejudice adaptation which was shortened and which downplayed a lot of the other characters in the story so as to focus on the two leads, I thought they did a similar job in this version. I thought their interactions were very sweet and I'm glad that was the focus. I felt it allowed us to get inside Anne's head a bit in this version.

Granted, they did change a few scenes around near the end and while I wasn't a huge fan of the 'marathon running' scene, I can empathize with the poor girl and may have been tempted to do the same in her position :)",1201132800,11,1168,4.1866666666666665

This did not stop me from enjoying this version, as much, and in some cases more, than the previous one.

I felt that many of the characters were less ""over the top"" in this new version, and more believeable.  I liked the fresh take on it.  I particularly enjoyed the performance of Rupert Penry-Jones.

As an avid fan of Jane Austen, and an owner of many versions of many of the film adaptations, I can recommend this as a delightful and heartfelt presentation.",1201046400,8,508,4.419354838709677

However, this film is NOT that other version and needs to be reviewed and weighted on its own merits. It does follow the storyline rather well, and while some scenes do seem a bit rushed, it is still true to the heart of this moving story.

Upon a 2nd and third viewing, I found the film rather charming, the acting good, the scenery and sets excellent. So, I would recommend this film. I think it is especially good for someone new to Jane Austen, but I feel that even Jane Austen fans will come to appreciate the film if they can but give it a chance.",1201046400,2,698,4.208955223880597
2759378,4,B000N6U0VU,"While I don't think any version of Persuasion can compare to the 1995 version, I really liked this one.  Liked, not loved. I didn't really appreciate all the moving camera work--it made my eyes hurt.  And it did seem almost like a Cliff's Notes version of Persuasion, rather than a fully fleshed out story.  Nonetheless, I think this was a good adaptation of the book for the short amount of time it took up--only 90 minutes. I do think that maybe part of the reason people so dislike this version is because PBS cut out about 10 minutes of the movie (10 important minutes, I might add) that would've added SO MUCH to the story line. I was really surprised when I saw some scenes between Harville and Wentworth that were not in the original airing on PBS.  How could they cut these scenes that were, for the most part, vital to the story?  Anyway, I won't spoil it if you haven't seen them before but I do think those ""missing scenes"" add much more to the story and make it more a movie than a long TV show.  The story does move fast, but I always love having a new version of a Jane Austen novel.  Unless, of course, it's really awful; which I don't think this version is, and that's why I give it four stars.",1201046400,2,1210,4.280701754385965
2759379,2,B000N6U0VU,"Overall, this was a disappointing and disjointed rendition of a novel at least as romantic as Pride and Prejudice, and far more packed with intense longing and poetic imagery.

I admit...Anne and Wentworth were attractive...though Anne never really ""bloomed"" into her full potential as I was hoping to see.

While some viewers have a hard time separating the actress that played Lady Russell from some of her previous roles and thus find her performance difficult to appreciate, I thought Lady Russell was well-represented and underused. She was finally given a bit more of a self-righteous and  judgmental edge that I think fits in very well with Austen's summation of her character. In fact, Lady Russell's spot-on portrayal is the pivot point for one of the few scenes in which Captain Wentworth's feelings for Anne actually seem real.

Anne is the most internalized and isolated of the Austen heroines, and
the strongest point of this new PBS adaptation was in the way it
demonstrated that fact of her life. That said, the film didn't do nearly as much (or really anything at all) to help the viewer understand the attractive points of Anne's personality.

It might have helped to SEE Anne discussing books with Captain Benwick then the speech that most strongly sells the Anne-Wentworth relationship could have been used to more effect closer to the end of the film...as it is instead of an impassioned declaration of mutual affection, we see a race around Bath. Including the invalid, Mrs.
Smith!

The race, and some of the odd camera work (there were a lot of very
close, tight shots on people's faces) could have been intended to help
us experience Anne's own feeling of disorientation, but I found it
more distracting and frustrating than helpful. Less motion, and a few nice shots of the romantic Lyme countryside might have have been a better representation of the stagnation Anne feels her life has undergone without Wentworth.

I suspect those familiar with the novel will find this representation less thrilling than reading it again, while those viewers new to the world of Austen would be missing all of the qualities that draw true fans. All of us would be better served to look elsewhere for an enjoyable movie.",1201046400,10,2229,4.928
2759380,3,B000N6U0VU,"While I enjoyed the new version of Persuasion, I was also disappointed in it. First of all, why only 90 minutes -- and by the time they did all the introductions, credits, etc. it was actually much shorter than that.
I have to begin by saying that I was really irritated when Anne's soulful speech about the constancy of men and women in love became part of her discussion at the dinner table at Lyme. In the book, Wentworth overhears Anne and Harville talking much later in the story and then writes the letter to her which prompts their reunion. This scene was created by Jane Austen as part of her rewrite of Persuasion specifically to improve the strength of the end of the story. Why would anyone want to second guess her?
As for the new version of the reconciliation, I guess since the writer used up the conversation about constancy earlier in the story, he had to invent a different way to explain how Anne and the Captain finally get together. The result is those rather silly and inappropriate scenes in which Anne is running all over Bath. Someone with Anne's upbringing would never have done that!
And their first kiss...it was embarassing to see how long it took them to get their lips together. Her lips, which were supposed to be quivering with anticipation I guess, instead looked like a fish out of water gasping for air. I blame some of these bad moments on the director, not the actors.
That said, I mostly liked Sally Hawkins as Anne. Sometimes she looked really pretty and sometimes she looked rather plain -- which is how I saw Anne when I read the book. Hawkins also did well portraying Anne's quiet strength and character.
Rupert Penry-Jones is gorgeous and did a great job as Wentworth(what a change from his role in the TV show Spooks/MI-5), but he definately did not look as if he had spent even a single day on the deck of a ship. His pale complexion was too perfect.
As for the dreadful portrayal of Mary Musgrove -- Where did that insipid laugh that the actress used several times come from?
Finally, what to say about the ending that was added! There is no way that Wentworth could have purchased Kellynch Hall -- lease it maybe but not buy it. He was rich but I don't think he could have afforded it even if Mr. Elliot was willing or able to sell (which I don't think he would be considering it was undoubtedly entailed to the younger Mr. Elliot).
This was such an opportunity to do something really remarkable and as far as I'm concerned, this movie missed the mark. Masterpiece Theater is usually great so I was surprised.
Ok, having said all of these negative things, I have to admit I enjoyed it at some level and it was definately better on second viewing but I'd rather spend my time watching the earlier version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hind -- or better still, reading the book.",1201046400,10,2821,4.51171875
2759381,1,B000N6U0VU,"Anyone who has viewed the 5-star masterpiece of Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds in their portrayal of this love story will surely know how truncated this depiction was.

I could not have been more disappointed.  Seriously, the only good thing to say about the film is I only wasted 90 minutes of my life.  The script was atrocious - they cut much of the story out, and the bits they did keep, although the correct conversation(s), were between the wrong people.  There was no chemistry at all between Anne and Wentworth, the characters did not feel developed at all, in short, it was ghastly.  On the other hand, the 1995 BBC version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds is its polar opposite - never a false step, superb casting, tightly woven script, magical chemistry between Anne and Wentworth.  If you're looking for a film of ""Persuasion"", the 1995 one is the only one worth viewing.",1201046400,10,921,4.7974683544303796
2759383,1,B000N6U0VU,"I think the title explains pretty well my beef with this adaptation.  Anne is a young lady of quiet moral strength (although admitedly not a great walker, hence Wentworth's assistance into the Crofts' carriage).  This adaptation portrays Anne as this weepy, wispy pathetic creature, not the good, kind, loving and patient Anne I know and love from Austen's book.  Not to mention the inconsistencies - Anne can fly about the house at Kellynch in the hustle and bustle of having move but can't endure a country walk and completely out of character run around Bath after the Captain.  The last ten-fifteen minutes were acutely painful.

My personal rule number one when doing a Jane Austen adaptation is do not, I repeat DO NOT mess with the declaration of love.  As long as that part is correct I can forgive many changes from the book, but don't change the declaration.  Unfortunately the writers of this version did not adhere to my Austen adaptation maxim and consequently marred Austen's lovely ending horrifically and for that this adaptation earns only one star.  I love the scene in the book where Anne talks with Capt. Harville at the window and Wentworth pours out his heart in a letter and leaves it for her to read.  It would have changed the timing very little of this adaptation had they done the ending properly and would have earned it a much higher rating from me.  If you're an Austen purest (want the movie to adhere strictly to the book) I suggest the 1971 version from the BBC (it originally aired as a miniseries so you may find it listed as such).  It is long but satisfyingly accurate especially with the declaration.  For a shorter but still good adaptation try the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds.  It condenses the book a good deal, but still maintains the essentials and doesn't mess with the declaration except for adding a kiss that they wouldn't have done in Austen's time (a forgivable addition in my book).",1200960000,10,1952,4.722713864306785

This production pales in comparison to the complexity of the book and serves as  a reminder of how wonderful  the 1995 film staring Amanda Root was.
  Just a couple thoughts: no well-bred young woman would run wildly  through  the streets, certainly not Anne Elliot. And why have the book end  with Wentworth purchasing Kellynch?  Isn't the reason that Mr. Elliot is in the book because he is going to inherit the entailed property and wants to insure any way he can that nothing comes between him and his inheritance?  He courts Mrs. Clay because he thinks that Sir Elliot may marry her and produce a new heir who could then inherit in his stead. The ending was just plain dumb.

2759387,2,B000N6U0VU,"In this latest BBC rendition, the characters of Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth lack depth, but Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones still manage a more than creditable job in their portrayals.  Hawkins is believable as the chronically sad baronet's daughter who turned her back on true love, and Penry-Jones really does look like a man whose heart was broken.  What class the film has can be ascribed to these two.

That said, this film is horrid.  Uninspired screenplay adaptations have been spoiling Jane Austen novels since the early 1940s, but this latest Persuasion screenplay by Simon Burke deserves special censure.  The plot is disjointed and the characters shallowly drawn, but the screenplay's worst offense is that it deprives the film of the grace and wit which abound throughout the novel.  The novel Persuasion is so packed with sparkling dialogue and astute observation of manners that a competent screenplay would merely have to trim it to keep it real and convey its emotion; Burke's effort doesn't get it done.  By eliminating critical dialogue and presenting major scenes out of sequence he manages only to confuse and frustrate viewers, and his apparent attempt to make the characters more modern causes them instead to seem inauthentic.  Anne Elliot is a sensible, confident woman--but she is still the daughter of a baronet.  To present her, for example, sprinting through the streets of Bath in search of Wentworth--while the supposedly crippled Mrs. Smith runs beside her to fill in the neglected plot line--is beyond ludicrous.

At 90 minutes the film is too short and required too much editing, but the 1995 BBC Films version (starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds) was a mere 104 minutes and still came out a masterpiece because its faithful Nick Dear screenplay sprang to life under Roger Michell's direction.  This latest effort relied upon director Adrian Shergold, best known for his work on Inspector Morse episodes for Masterpiece Theatre's Mystery series.  But Shergold could work no magic here.  Burke's screenplay was simply too full of holes.

Sally Hawkins is magnificent as Anne Elliot. It took me a long while to pin-point what I love about Hawkins portrayal of Anne. She is the 'llama among horses.' Confused by that? Llamas have a very calming effect on wild-spirited horses when kept in the same locale (look it up). Strange analogy it may be, but I find that to be one of the most endearing qualities of Anne Elliot- though not the most desired creature, she brings serenity to the often trivial crises in her life. As to Rupert Penry-Jones portrayal of Frederick Wentworth... it simply does not get any better.  He is the master of unspoken words and pain impossible to hide. This movie captures the morbid tension surrounding disappointed love in a fashion that I have yet to find in another movie. Having read the book, I have found distinct discrepencies. However, that falls to the wayside as the general emotion and feel of the book is perfectly portrayed. The only reason I must give it a 4 star rating is the last street scene.

It wasn't horrific, but it wasn't good. In fact, it was quite strange. First, there were inaccuracies that seemed to serve no purpose.  This didn't bother me too much, except at the end. Second, there were a few odd close-up shots of Anne Elliot that were disconcerting; it was almost like Anne Elliot the character knew that she had an audience.  Third, the acting style of the actor who played the younger Mr. Elliot was overly stiff; perhaps this is just a difference in interpretation of the character. Fourth, the movie was incredibly choppy; items 2 and 3 on this list certainly contributed to that.  Fifth, I found myself thinking that people who hadn't read the book would have had a difficult time figuring out how some of the characters were related to others.  Sixth, the actress who plays Mary, the youngest Elliot sister, makes her seem mentally disturbed; in Austen's novel, Mary is petulant, vain, easily offended and incredibly self-absorbed, but there is no hint of mental illness.  Seventh, while Wentworth's returning to Anne makes a fair amount of sense in the book, it seems insufficiently motivated here; it might be because Anne doesn't come across quite so well in the movie as she does in the book.  It might also be because Wentworth seems a little too indifferent to Anne throughout the movie. He doesn't even seem to be the kind of person who would appreciate someone like Anne. Eighth, I agree with the reviewer who thought that Elizabeth looked too old to be Anne's slightly older sister.  This didn't bother me, but it's another oddity in a rather long list of oddities.

Persuasion is by far my favourite of the Austen novels, so I admit myself to be biased on the subject, but the changes made to the screenplay leave me bewildered as to whether or not a) the writer and director knew anything of society during that period of time, and b) anyone involved with the film had ever read the actual book.

There is much to love about this film: the costuming, the scenery, even a good deal of the acting, and for the most part I was able to get through it thinking that although it certainly was not a good adaptation, it wasn't a complete loss either.

They turned Anne (the heroine) into a weepy, desperate & emotional basket-case instead of portraying her as a self-confident (in a quiet way), dignified, and full of common sense.

2759396,2,B000N6U0VU,"Along with others who have written, I was very unhappy with this version of Persuasion.  One would think that a newer adaptation would be better than the one in 1995 but this is not the case.  The actor who played Captain Wentworth was well enough but where did they get the actress who played Anne Elliot?  And why did the director spend so much time having Anne stare into the camera after writing one of her letters?  How annoying!  I didn't really feel that much sympathy for her as much as I felt for Amanda Root in 1995.  The gentle way Captain Wentworth helps Anne into the carriage in the 1995 version coming back from the 'long walk' was changed with the abrupt way this new Captain grabs Anne by the arm and hoists her on the back of the carriage like a sack of potatoes! There were so many inconsistencies I cannot understand why this version was even made.  Somtimes it is better to leave well enough alone.",1200614400,9,919,4.402366863905326
2759397,1,B000N6U0VU,***Spoiler*** Since when does Captain Wentworth buy Kellynch for Anne? I was cringing. Did the producers read the book? I was hoping for something a bit better.

2759398,1,B000N6U0VU,"I'm afraid there were few redeeming points to this production of 'Persuasion.'  So I'll start there.
Costumes:  Great
Cinamatography: Very Good
Actors: They could have been very good had the screen play been any good.

I kept commenting to my husband that I felt I needed a neck brace since the pace of the story was so quick.  It was so quick, there was no way to get to know the characters.  Jane Austen is probably the English Languages best female writer.  She draws her characters so well that you feel you know them.  You either like them, hate them, or endure them - just like in real life.

This production was poorly done, none of the characters resembled who they were.  to make an analogy - it's like watered down skimmed milk.  Ick.  Captain Wentworth had no depth, and Anne Elliot was so hopeless, she seemed of no use to anyone.

If you did not see this version of 'Persuasion' save yourself the trouble.

 It's only 2 hrs long (approx) and even at that short lenght is faithful to the story.  Captain Wentworth has true feeling ... always watching from under his eyelashes without Anne ever knowing.  He is galant, and the abiss of his true emotions are just below his finely chisseled features.  Excellent!!",1200614400,12,1424,5.095238095238095
2759399,3,B000N6U0VU,"Yes, I loved the book, tied with ""Pride and Prejudice"" as my favorite Austen, and I tried not to be disappointed by this production. But the truth is, that in Austen's hands, the characters of Anne and Captain Wentworth generated more heat by themselves, much less together, than this production can muster with all the collective brilliance of the BBC's creative team.

And I say that with all due respect.

The bad reviews of this DVD seem to stem from the usual, predictable disappointment people feel when their beloved book becomes physically and spiritually shrinkwrapped, so to speak, to fit into the format of a contemporary two-hour TV piece and DVD.

That said, I remember feeling ""lit from within"" when I first read this stirring classic. I related strongly to Anne, developed a mental snapshot of her that I've carried fondly all these years. Sally Hawkins, it should be said, is a wonderful actress, and probably a worthy Anne, except not what I or many others pictured from the book.

Ditto actor Rupert Penry-Jones, who also boasts a distinguished resume (his marriage to the estimable Irish actress Dervla Kirwan not the least among his accomplishments), yet as Captain Wentworth his demeanor and deportment sag, rendering both first, and more sadly, last impressions of his character hopelessly milquetoast.

Titillated by the passion with which reviewers here recommend the Root-Hinds version, I look forward to enjoying it.

In all sincerity, nice try, Masterpiece Theatre. You did a somewhat better, more satisfying (but too postcard pretty) job with Jane Eyre. Though that production felt not quite dark enough in its atmospherics, lead actors Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens somehow managed, nonetheless, to pull off the heat and pulse we Eyre-ites all yearned to feel.",1200528000,3,1789,5.130584192439863

It is as though the people responsible for this disaster were DESPERATE to distance themselves from the perfection that is the 1995 film with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.  To achieve this lofty goal, they set out to hire ALL the wrong people: Screenwriter, Director, Actors and Photographers. The result--the Anti-Austen, or rather, Austen Lite--a film reduced to a melodrama that surely has the author spinning in her grave. All the opportunities that make this a most wonderful book were cast aside. The result: A spiritless, emotionless and humorless film--and a colossal waste of an evening.

If you've read the book, which I highly recommend, and see the 1995 movie, then you would see everything wrong with this drivel! I was disappointed. I suppose the casting and costumes were acceptable, but no where in the book does Anne go off and pour out her heart into some journal like some forlorn teenager. And I don't recall her being a clutz either. I don't remember her tripping in the book. In the book and in the 1995 version which got it right the first time, Anne is strong, capable, and more than worthy of any man's affection. In this one she comes off as a pathetic old maid pining away for her man. Of course, I missed the part where Frederick is writing her the letter and hands it her. Where's the swoon value in taking it out? The climax is that letter. It's a love letter to her. She's running around like some celebrity stalker chasing after him and is so out of breath I expected her to collapse at any moment. I hated this! I wouldn't waste my money on it. There's no hateful sister who would rather leave her sister to walk in the rain, nor is her snobbish buffoon of a father who is played by Anthony Head. I kept expecting Buffy to leap out at any moment. I'm not a purist, but I do like faithful adaptations of a great book. Even Louisa's fall from the wall is kept out. It's shortened here and reveals nothing about Louisa's character. I recommend the 1995 version. It's as faithful to Anne as you can get and who can forget the ending where he takes her with him on his next voyage and they sail off into the sunset? This one he buys her the house and that's that. It's a very cold and empty version. I thought Masterpiece theater could have done much better. Tape it, don't buy it. Read the book and buy the 1995 BBC version.

I have seen it several times, including at the movie theatre, and that version was so rich and deep and satisfyingly romantic. In this current version though, I did like Sally Hawkins a lot. I found her to be a wonderful actress with beautiful eyes and expressions. It was not her fault her part was written so poorly and wimpily. Several reviewers have mentioned  the kiss between the leads, I have to agree! It was not good, and shot at a bad camera angle.
Also the sound was horrid, people were talking in those big drafty English parlors and rooms, and the echos were so strong it sounded as though they just had put little microphones on the floor.
I did enjoy the show, but I have to say I kept constantly comparing to the 1995 SO much better version.

I don't think it was well cast (Wentworth was fine, but Anne was relatively annoying) and what is up with Anne running all over town, kissing all over Wentworth? I'm pretty sure all of that was not acceptable in the period, especially since Anne had given up her engagement to Wentworth because of her status, I can't see her flying in the face of tradition this much.

If you really want to watch a version of Persuasion, watch the 1995 version. It was much more true to the story, better cast and better filmed.",1200441600,4,614,4.482142857142857
2759407,1,B000N6U0VU,"This production was execrable in nearly every way.  The acting and casting were bad for most of the characters, the direction was bad, but most particularly, the writing was bad.  This is not about the adaptation being unlike the book; every screen adaptation of a novel is a screenwriter's effort to make a dramatic work from a written work.  Simon Burke did a wonderful job of adapting Tom Jones for the BBC in 1997; something has gone very wrong this time.  Either he did not like or understand the novel, in which case he should have turned down the project, or else his hand was forced by the producers, in which case it is surprising that he allowed his name to be put to this amateurish adaptation.  It is blighted with three features characteristic of a bad screenplay, to the point that it is difficult to understand why it was produced at all: The stilted expository speeches put into the mouths of the characters, e.g.""Oh hello, Anne Elliot.  You were disappointed in love eight years ago and are afraid you will become an old maid, because women your age in this time period ought to be married by now, just in case the audience can't keep up with what's going on."" With a lack of concision also characteristic of a bad screenplay, how many scenes were wasted on the lead character sitting at her desk, in a production that condensed a complex novel into 90 minutes of screen time? Finally, the narrative voice-over really completed the amateurish feel.  That silly scene at the end where she's running all over Bath in her slippers is just a recap of what's wrong with the whole show.  Ew! Badly done!",1200441600,27,1614,4.599303135888502
2759408,1,B000N6U0VU,"I tried to watch the latest version of Persuasion without thinking about the book or the 1995 movie when it came on PBS this past weekend. My comments are based upon the notes I took.
 The actress who plays Ann has two expressions; a rare smile and this slack-jawed, vacant-eyed look that indicates all other feelings.
 Who casted these actors? Brother in law Charles looks older than his parents. Elizabeth looks too old to be her father's daughter. CPT. Wentworth's sister and brother in law look old enough to be his parents. Mary is demented. CPT Wentworth is good. Am I supposed to believe he is carrying a torch for that slack-jawed little mouse. The Admiral does not act like one. (I am a retired military officer and believe me the British are officers to the grave and beyond)
 Mrs. Smith is so ill that she has to hire a nurse to give her care but she is well enough to walk over to Ann's house to give her a message.
 Brought up in this terribly restrictive society, Ann runs out, without a hat, to try and find CPT. Wentworth. She goes on this chase (think 3 Stooges) OOOPs you just missed him, try there, ooops missed him again, keep going. What they could have done was to add a person at every stop so that there could have been a line of people following Ann to emphasize that this is supposed to be a farce.
 My notes weren't very complete because about 15 minutes into the movie I picked up some handiwork and didn't pay full attention to it. I kept it on because PBS had been advertising this for months and I kept thinking, but Hollywood didn't make this, it has to get better. It didn't.

Although I purchased the 1995 version mentioned above right after seeing it, and have enjoying watching it many times, I am not planning on buying this version.  Don't get me wrong, this movie is also good and many will enjoy it.  I just like the portrayal of the characters in the Amanda Root and Claran Hines production better.",1200441600,5,602,4.75
2759410,1,B000N6U0VU,"They did one thing I liked: Captain Benwick was well cast and the scenes between him and Anne really worked, though they would have worked better if they'd used Jane Austen's dialog.

If I could I'd give this zero stars because:

*Jane Austen's novels are more than romances -- this version tries to turn PERSUASION into a romance novel, pure and simple. It leaves out every nuance of character, every side plot (including the Crofts' marriage, which in the book and the 1995 film version contrasted so painfully with Anne's situation), and doesn't even hold together as a film in its own right!

*instead of the novel's dramatic conclusion (when Captain Wentworth is writing the letter while Anne is talking about women ""loving longest"" -- for some bizarre reason, this speech was edited and then moved to the middle of the film), this script writer has Anne running around Bath.....

*many, many scenes are cut, and replaced by Anne sighing, or crying, while sad music plays...the opening sequence didn't even really make sense.

*the casting (with the exception of Captain Benwick and maybe Anne herself) was off: Captain Wentworth would NOT look young and cute - with a practically unlined face - after all those years in the English navy; Mary was TOO pretty, Elizabeth not nearly pretty enough; the Harvilles, instead of being warm and welcoming were shown only when Captain Harville LECTURED Captain Wentworth (another scene invented by the truly terrible writer)

*all the comic scenes were cut (Mrs. Musgrove's ""large fat sighings,"" for example), as was one of the MOST romantic ones: hen Anne is trying to take care of one nephew while another hangs round her neck -- remember how in the book Captain Wentworth simply walks up to her and firmly removes the child?

SURELY there are better writers out there! Why didn't they hire one?",1200441600,65,1843,4.906752411575563

However it is a movie - there will always be moments and scenes missing especially when we talk about the subtle ones. It is impossible to make the movie like the book second my second, it just won't work. I love reading Austen, but this is not about reading it. I won't compare the book to the movie, but judge the movie on it's on. (Even the Pride and Prejudice of '94 isn't that faithful to the book and yet everyone's gaga over it :)

Now, I personally loved the movie. it was tastefully done, the cinematography was marvelous, and the characters were very convincing without overpowering one another. The suspense was built very nicely and the music, which indeed might be a bit of a cliche BBC, was appropriately used. I was moved by all of the characters and I think they were perfectly cast. I have seen the previous version (1999) and this one I like far better. Despite all of the missing bit and pieces from the book I will still say that the screenplay and adaptation were done very good indeed. It evokes the same emotions of the book and that's what counts (to me at least).
I highly recommend this movie to all Austen fans. It is worth your time!",1200355200,10,1276,4.383966244725738

Fortunately we have the rich, subtle Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds version the BBC made in 1995 to turn to.  Not only is it more faithful to the novel, it is also a smoother story, less choppy and abrupt.

I had a number of objections, but my chief one was the alteration to the character of Anne Elliot.  She is supposed to be a woman of quiet moral strength whose family dismisses her as a nonentity.  She courageously makes the best of a life that has disappointed her ever since she was persuaded to give up marrying the man of her choice years earlier.  This version portrayed her as a poor, pathetic, meek creature who hides away in a corner and weeps whenever anyone hurts her feelings.  My secondary objection was the kissing and wild running around the street.  No respectable woman of the period would EVER have behaved that way in public.  Who decided to do this?  It almost seemed to be the work of someone who thought Austen's restraint was too tame for 21st century tastes, but since it is bizarrely popular, let's re-write it with more modern behavior.",1200355200,223,1214,4.6

And I was not disappointed!  I was pleased with the two leads, Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones.  Both actors turned in excellent performances and had real chemistry, a must for this film--they made you believe that their characters' love, denied for so long, was still real and present in their lives.  Sally Hawkins as Anne was especially good; she radiated such sincerity in the role.  The camera would often linger on her face, and she revealed much about her character without saying a word.

I was also pleased that the actors actually looked the ages of their parts.  Although I loved Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds in the previous version, I often had difficulty believing their characters were in their late 20s and early 30s, respectively.

I liked Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth but found the majority of the other characters not up to my expectations. Overall, that version always seems to me a little flat.

I am sorry to say that this new adaptation did not do much better. I was very disappointed with the way that essential scenes were altered and I felt that the story was overall too rushed. I wish they had allowed themselves another 20-30 minutes to give enough time for the story to develop or found away to make it work within the 90 minutes they had. I am not opposed to Rupert Penry-Jones as Wentworth - he is dashing and offers a good portrayal for the most part. I can't say I was as impressed with Sally Hawkins. There was something a little awkward about her. I didn't think she was a bad Anne Elliot - just not quite what I expected. I agree with one of the other reviewers assessments of her sisters - Mary is unnecessarily irritating - at times she was too comically overdone - and Elizabeth is not attractive at all.

Finally - although the setting and score were very well done, some of the camera work was off-putting. There were alot of strange angles and cut-away shots that made certain moments a little difficult to watch.

In the lovely 1995 version, you see the underlying humor, will, and strength of character in Anne. Frederick and Anne also have exchanges that reveal their passion for one another. While it also takes liberty with some of the original story - I've always wanted to see the drama with her widow friend included more - it is definitely more moving and better developed.

I was very tempted to give this film only one star but Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins' performances made me refrain from being so harsh.

Unfortunately, I found the film very abridged and the movie skipped forward very rapidly.  A lot was left out including the details of Wentworth and Anne's first meeting and the back story to do with Mrs. Smith.  And as one reviewer already noted, Anne's behaviour at the ending was definitely out of character and not at all how she would have acted.

The cinematography also left much to be desired.  Many of the shots were jarring from one character to another and the transitions between scenes were poorly done.  The close up shots were overused and it would have much improved the film if we didn't spend so much time looking at the backs of people's heads.

Newbies may enjoy it (and I always welcome anything that will entice newcombers into the fold!) as themes and intrigues are actually spelled out.  Nonetheless, the gift of Jane Austen is in the subtleties, the sharp wit and delicate humor, and the layers in her characters.

In this 90 minute flick, the story felt rushed.  Usually, I do not mind if the director cuts and pastes the story and dialogue if it actually improves the pace, but this was not the case.

And Sally Hawkins was so miscast!  Every time she came on scene, I feared a fly might enter her mouth. Even this film's Mrs. Smythe was a stronger female character than Anne! Hawkin's Anne was dull witted and washed out... and by the  end there was no transformation.  She just seemed desperate.  And I simply cannot see how her weak personality and appearance could attract any man (William Elliott at first sight or the handsome Captain Wentworth!)  The kiss at the end lacked any chemistry. Sally Hawkins with Rupert Penry-Jones was a total mismatch.  If the female lead was better,  I would have been more forgiving.

I'm not sure if the people who made this version are just totally off the mark and think they can improve Jane Austen by making all kinds of ridiculous changes, or if trying to cram the novel into 90 minutes was just overwhelming and they ended up with this horrible mess. I have read the novel several times, and this version just doesn't capture the tension, the wit and humor--anything. Nor is the character development at all detailed or believable. On a humorous note, some of the changes the movie made to the novel are so ridiculous that they're laugh-out-loud funny:
Anne running around Bath chasing after Captain Wentworth and then finally running straight into him, almost knocking him and her brother-in-law over;
Harriet Smith--the invalid friend--achieving a a sudden miraculous recovery allowing her to trot nimbly down the street with Anne so that she can tell her all about how evil Anne's cousin, Mr. Eliot is;
Captain Wentworth giving Anne her family's estate Kellynch as a wedding gift!
I give it two stars because it looks pretty. If you're a true Jane Austen fan, steer clear. It's funny that people try to change what is already perfect--it never works.

2759422,1,B000N6U0VU,"Please do not waste your money.  The actors are dour, lifeless, and constantly stare into the camera.  It quickly becomes annoying.  They have pointlessly rearranged dialogue from the book so, for example, Wentworth makes an idiot of himself describing the woman he would marry in front of a crowd of people.  Even more annoying at the beginning and the end of the movie they have Anne running marathons through her house and the streets of Bath.  Did anyone read the book or even the Cliff Notes to get the point about persuasion?  Guess not.  For some reason they have taken out all of the wit and insight of Jane Austen and left you with some soggy melodramatic sop.  Run, do not walk, to the nearest bookstore and buy the book or, if you want a video, there is a very solid and more faithful rendition from 1995 as mentioned earlier.",1200268800,42,837,4.533333333333333
2759423,2,B000N6U0VU,"Another Masterpiece Theatre production where I ended up thinking, ""huh?""  (I felt the same way about ""Woman in White"").  And I just saw an excellent MT adaptation of Jane Eyre so I'm amazed at how bad this production was.  The lead actors--Rupert Penry Jones and Sally Hawkins-- had no chemistry and I didn't believe they had been pining for each other for the last eight years.  The camera angles were annoying and I hated the way Anne would speak directly to the camera--it was too campy and out of place.  And I didn't like this Anne nearly as much as Amanda Root's potrayal--in the 1995 production Anne was quiet but smart and strong and dignified, nothing like the Anne in the MT version who seemed silly and weepy and so so weak.  And don't even get me started on the ending and that laughable kiss.  I was glad it was only 90 minutes long.",1200182400,18,846,4.454545454545454
2759424,3,B000N6U0VU,"I'll give this production three stars because while it's a fairly entertaining adaptation of what I believe to be Austen's finest novel, I found the jerky camera work to be distracting, the male lead insipid, and the overall narrative inconsistent with Austen's incomparable novel.

Sally Hawkins is endearing as Anne, and Rupert Penry-Jones is a charming enough Wentworth, although I had a difficult time truly apprehending that his Wentworth truly spent eight years pining for love lost. The reviewer who likened Anne running around Bath for the penultimate 5 minutes of the film to a headless turkey hit it dead on--no true gentleman's daughter would behave in such a fashion! In addition, this production didn't have what I call a ""deep bench"".  The supporting actors seem to be there just for scenery, not really adding to the depth of the narrative. That said, it's a nice enough distraction if you're looking for a good film to pass an hour and a half.

For a truly faithful and well-acted adaptation of Persuasion, I wholeheartedly recommend the vastly superior 1995 version starring Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.",1200182400,14,1121,5.048648648648649
