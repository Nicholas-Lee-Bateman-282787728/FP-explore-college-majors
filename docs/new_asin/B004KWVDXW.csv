8433517,1,B004KWVDXW,"This DVD did not play in my Sony DVD player. Got a replacement and it still has the same problem. I even tried playing on a laptop and a desktop but the DVD just refuses to play, I gave up finally. Hope others do not have the same experience.",1423267200,,242,3.9591836734693877
8433518,5,B004KWVDXW,I was looking around for a long time to find some kid friendly DVDs to use as part of our home school physical education class and this DVD has been a great hit with my daughter and I. My daughter is 10 but I would say that anyone from the age of 8 and up would enjoy this. They don't jump into complicated moves and they build slowly on moves that have multiple steps. I join in with my daughter and even my two and three year old hop in and join us! I would buy this again. I don't think you will be disappointed with this one.,1413417600,3,529,3.9074074074074074
8433519,5,B004KWVDXW,My 7 year old daughter likes this workout. Its a little advance for her but she just tries her best and really works up a sweat. Great dvd for those summer days when its too hot to play outside and winter times when its too cold to be outside.,1406419200,,243,3.979591836734694
8433520,2,B004KWVDXW,I bought this to workout with my kids during the summer. The video does not offer any instructions as to how to complete the exercises and looks like it was filmed in a garage. I think for kids instructions are a must.,1403913600,,218,4.214285714285714
8433521,5,B004KWVDXW,I bought this for my 8 year old daughter. She wanted a workout video like mine. She seems to enjoy this. Good workout for someone her age.,1392508800,4,138,4.148148148148148
8433522,5,B004KWVDXW,My 12 year old daughter likes this video a lot. Its simple yet effective. I like to do it with her too. :D They do a routine of kicks and punches. The background has teenage kids doing the workout with an adult female kickboxing trainer.,1390867200,5,237,4.288888888888889
