1779287,5,B00006JDTH,"It is rare to find a workout in which you enjoy all the exercises. This is one of those exceptional routines that combines a sensuous flow of movement, motivational music and invigorating routines.

The setting is striking and the music will be loved by anyone who enjoys the ""Pure Moods"" CDs. What you will completely love is the ability to use your own music. There is an ""Alternative Audio Track"" containing absolutely no music! That is a real bonus in the Special Features section.

If you have a CD player or stereo in the same room, you can play any motivational music you prefer and if you want to play relaxing music with candles, you can adapt the workout to suit your more relaxed mood.

They have also included:

Position Breakdowns - pictures and explanations
Instructor Biographies

This is actually a medium to fast paced workout in places and then at times it slows to a complete standstill as you relax into the poses. This is the ""vinyasa"" or flow of poses style.

Frankly, it is perfect. If you are a beginner, you have time to catch up while advanced and intermediate students are already in the ""standstill"" stage. I loved the way this routine can be adapted for all levels of yoga practice.

While I've done yoga for a few years on and off, this has to be not only the most invigorating routine, but also the most enjoyable. My entire body felt warm within a few minutes and at the end I was convinced I had really received an excellent workout. My arms, legs and stomach could feel they had been put through the motions, yet I felt completely relaxed and in a good frame of mind as the routine wound down to a completely relaxed pace.

Kristin McGee is an excellent instructor and her queuing is perfect if not the best I've ever heard. She knows how to translate her knowledge to the students all while giving the names of the poses and emphasizing breathing.

You literally fall under her spell and do exactly what she tells you to do. There is no resistance. I was impressed with her creativity and especially enjoyed the unique hip stretches that felt so good. She explains the difference between the lunge and warrior poses and gives tips throughout the workout. You feel nurtured throughout your practice.

Poses you will learn:

Downward Facing Dog
Chaturanga - the most difficult yoga move I've tried, but they have variations.
Warrior One
Warrior Two
Warrior Three
Extended Side Angle
Twisted Lunge
Upward Facing Dog
Triangle
Boat Pose
Tree Pose
Baby Cobra
Locust
And more...

The routine opens with breathing and this is emphasized throughout the entire workout. You will know when to breathe in and out and soon you will realize that in fact, once you get past the first 10 minutes, your breathing will become naturally more rapid in pace. You then will be doing standing postures, back bends, forward bends and all the poses listed above. The balancing poses were perhaps some of the most challenging moves and you might want to stand near a wall when first attempting those particular exercises.

This workout is perfect for beginning, intermediate and advanced students. You will need a yoga mat and a block. These are items you can find almost in any store these days or are easily found online.

I strongly advise purchasing the DVD for the special features! Since the DVD offers an alternative audio track, this is appropriate for all ages and you can do the routine without any music if you prefer a more ascetic or worshipful approach. The alternative audio track is perhaps the most exciting part of this DVD besides the excellent instruction.

Highly recommended! 10 Stars. Now in my top 10 of
favorite workouts.

1779288,4,B00006JDTH,"I found this DVD to be a breath of fresh air.
They guide you through everything, the breathing the stands.
The best part was you actually see three levels of Yoga and you don't feel as bad when your at the 1st level.
The music was great, the host was very welcoming. She was a great motivation, just looking at her perfect body is enough to work hard.
Try it!!...",1048032000,2,363,4.2
1779289,5,B00006JDTH,"this is a great yoga dvd for the beginner to the more flexible advanced yogi.  It gives a full, satisfying, and peaceful workout to some great music.  I highly recommend it.",1046908800,,173,4.548387096774194
1779290,5,B00006JDTH,"I used MTV Yoga for the first time yesterday, and I'm greatful that I purchased it.  This was my frist time to try yoga.  It was simple, but at the same time I recieved a great workout.  All of my muscles feel tightened from last nights yoga session, and I can't wait to see what I'll look like in a couple weeks!
You should be flexible if you order this video because I wouldn't rate it as a beginners yoga tape, although you could always work up to the more advance positions through time.
All in all, I'm happy I bought this & recommend it highly.",1045440000,2,550,4.169811320754717
1779291,5,B00006JDTH,"This was an excellent workout!  I've been doing a beginner yoga video for a few months, it was very elementary and boring.  MTV Yoga challenged me and was a lot more fun.  Some of the poses are more advanced and a little harder to do, if you're used to one of those ""beginner"" videos, as I was.  But I found myself actually laughing as I was doing it, because I was having fun trying those harder poses, and giggling when I'd practically fall over from lack of balance, I'm sure I'll get better with practice!  But I really reccommend this video, I can REALLY feel it today, I'm sore, and thats wonderful, I feel great.  I never felt like this the day after those other videos!",1044489600,3,677,4.333333333333333
1779292,5,B00006JDTH,"I'm a beginner to yoga, but even I found this DVD fun and easy to follow.  Instructor Kristin McGee teaches Vinyasa style, which is a flowing, dance-like style rather than slow poses.  Some of the poses were difficult, especially the balancing ones, but they can be easily modified with blocks or a yoga strap.  I especially liked the constant breath coaching, since like a lot of people I tend to hold my breath while exercising.  The music wasn't that great, in fact I found it distracting, so I liked the ""instructor-only"" audio track.  McGee is a wonderfully no-nonsense coach and doesn't waste time with ""feel the energy from the earth/you are one with the universe"" statements.  This is a great DVD if you are doing yoga for exercise rather than as a spiritual practice.  I was sore the next day, but I'm looking forward to doing this one again.",1044057600,13,851,4.671140939597316
1779293,5,B00006JDTH,"I have started practicing Iyengar yoga and wanted a few videos to practice at home.  After viewing this video, I was very impressed with Kristin McGee's cueing ability, her attention to the breath, and overall flow through the poses.  I also really appreciate that there are 3 levels so that once I master the beginning foundational poses I can look at the other two people on the video for more challenging postures.
This is a very good yoga workout, it is challenging, yet it has a lot of the same feel as a yoga class does.  It combines the spiritual with the practical.  Definitely worth the money!",1042848000,6,602,4.598130841121495
1779294,4,B00006JDTH,I was amazed at how quickly my body was strengthened and lengthened by this video ! It is also relaxing and well paced. I love the three levels of difficulty to provide room for growth.,1042848000,2,185,4.314285714285714
1779295,5,B00006JDTH,"To give you an idea of where this reviewer is coming from, I'm a guy in my 50's who loves to exercise. I enjoy resistance training, vigorous aerobics (especially rebounding), and most of all, yoga, which I've been practicing for many years. My favorite styles of yoga are Bikram's and ""power yoga."" I have dozens of yoga videos, and am very glad that the MTV Yoga DVD is now part of my collection. This is an excellent workout! I would rate it ""Intermediate,"" although modifications are shown throughout, so I don't think it would be beyond the reach of a beginner in search of an energetic workout.
 If you enjoy power yoga style routines, and you're looking for something fresh that doesn't feel and look like just another Baron or Bryan video (as good as they are!), I think you'll be very pleased with this one.
 The instructor is Kristin McGee, and she is excellent! She's very ""normal,"" down to earth, and has no annoying traits or habits, like some teachers do. There's not a trace of woo-woo on this video! Her instructions are precise and very helpful. I only caught one mistake - she does a variation for one of the poses on one side, and neglects to do it for the other side (in the pigeon pose with the bent right leg forward, after extending upper body over the leg, you sit upright, still in pigeon pose, reach back with the left arm, grasp the left ankle and bring it towards you to stretch the left quadriceps. She doesn't do that for the right quad). That surprised me, since she pays so much attention to details. Now when doing the workout, I just come out of the forward bend pigeon on the right side a few seconds before they do, and stretch the quad.
 The workout is 45 minutes long. It's nonstop flowing, but never grueling. I really appreciated and was impressed by her breath cueing. She tells you when to breathe in/breathe out throughout the entire workout, but does it so quietly and with such rhythmical regularity, that it's kind've hypnotic and almost becomes subliminal. Hers is the best and most consistent ""breath coaching"" I've seen in any video.
 There is one sequence I especially like for its dance-like feel: at one point you go into Warrior 1 and hold for several breaths, then into Warrior 2 for several breaths, move through Plank, Updog, Downdog, then repeat for the other side. Kristin then repeats this sequence 3 times, matching 1 breath to each movement, so it flows quickly and smoothly. Nice!
This is a total body workout, with a good selection of Warriors 1 & 2, Extended Side Angle, Triangle, Wide Leg Forward Bend, etc. There are balancing poses, starting with Tree pose. From Tree pose, you bring the bent knee to the front and bend forward at the waist while straightening the bent leg out behind you, going into Warrior 3 (Standing T Pose). After coming back up to Standing, you bring the right foot up, grasping the big toe with the first two fingers of the right hand, and extend the leg out straight (Lori does an easier modification). Then you take the extended leg out to the side, looking over the opposite shoulder, return the leg to the front, release the big toe and hold the leg in the air (""Imagine a helium balloon tied to your foot, lifting the leg as high as it will go""). Repeat on the other side. There's a bit of back work (baby Cobra, easy Locust and Bow) and seated forward bends. There's a seated spinal twist and the Boat pose. There is no Plow, no Shoulder Stand, no Bridge or Wheel.
 The music has a good beat, but I never found it intrusive; was mostly just aware of a beat in the background. The DVD lets you choose between the workout with music, or with no music at all!
 The set is pleasant. There are 3 students in the class; a young man showing the more advanced version of the poses, a young woman showing intermediate modifications, and Lori Trespicio (from MTV's The Real World) is the ""beginner."" They work in ""mirror image"" which I always appreciate!
 After the workout, several of the poses are broken down in a Q & A format. Lori, who ""hosts"" the video, tells Kristin that she has some questions about several of the poses, and Kristin walks her through those particular poses, giving helpful pointers. Lori asks questions that anyone fairly new to yoga might ask, so I thought that was a great way to do it. Even experienced practitioners might find some helpful advice in Kristin's pointers.
 Hope this review was helpful - I've tried to include the kinds of things I like to hear in video reviews. And I hope I've shown that this is definitely a legitimate yoga workout, led by a very competent and likable instructor!",1039132800,282,4613,4.556091676718938
1779306,5,B00006JDTH,"A lot of yoga vids are very boring, but this one isn't. The music is not overpowering but it keeps you motivated. It's good that they have all levels of difficulty and that after it's all over they go over all of the poses with you so that you can master.",1374451200,,255,4.019607843137255
1779307,5,B00006JDTH,I've used this yoga workout for years and I had to buy the dvd when my vhs tape ran out.  I've gotten better at it over the years and there's a lot of room to do your own thing.  I love this yoga workout!  It workouts eveyrthing while stretching you out!,1369267200,,254,3.9411764705882355

1779309,5,B00006JDTH,"This is an excellent DVD to use to get into yoga.  It gets your attention, addresses all levels of skill, and keeps you moving so fast the workout is over before you know it.  And you will be sore for a day or two!",1356912000,,214,3.840909090909091
1779310,4,B00006JDTH,"I have been doing this yoga routine for 10 years! I actually purchased it twice, because I lost my original copy at one point. When I first got it back in 2002, I was out of shape from having my first son. I couldn't even get halfway through the routine before I turned it off. Discouraged, I didn't go back to it for almost year. Once I started back, I kept at it and eventually was able to do the more advanced variations of the routine with ease. I used this DVD (in addition to brisk walking) to lose pregnancy weight each time I had a child. Compared to other yoga workouts that I've tried in the past 10 years I really like this one the best. Kristen McGee is a wonderful instructor. She's not boring, like many but she also isn't so excited about the routine that it seems fake. The music in the DVD is nice as well. It's not too loud or obnoxious. I would definitely recommend this to someone, despite the fact that it's now 10 years old.",1342396800,,946,4.2032967032967035
1779311,5,B00006JDTH,This is a fantastic video for beginners and those who are quote experienced! I love this workout and it is by far one of my favorite tits videos! I do recommend this video!,1331683200,,172,4.242424242424242
1779312,3,B00006JDTH,"I liked this DVD but with one exception -- the music!  I realize that they were trying to make it more appealing to the general public by adding upbeat music but, to me, thats not yoga. Yoga should be relaxing and calming -- it shouldn't have a techno/house beat in the background. Its a shame because I probably would have purchased the DVD if it weren't for the music -- I really liked the instructor. If only there were an option to do the routine without the music.",1303171200,,469,4.329545454545454
1779313,5,B00006JDTH,"Okay...first off.  Watch this entire DVD FIRST before even attempting to do the routine, especially if you've never practiced yoga.  This is a faster paced yoga workout, especially during the first half of the routine.  The music is fast-paced yet very relaxing and soulful (a trance-meets-New-Age sort of feel).  It's not the 'meditative' kind of yoga that most Americans have already in their minds before they ever step foot on a yoga mat.  Yet it IS very meditative!  Once you have been doing this routine for a while, you really no longer need to pay too much attention, except to the cues to go through the different poses, and you can truly begin to make your mind-body connection.  I have seen a few complaints of people saying that this is too fast...that they cannot transition quickly in the areas where she has you moving quickly.  It is stated at the very beginning that this is exactly the type of workout it is.  It WILL make you sweat the first few times you do it, and you WILL be burning some extra calories.  One you are able to do the poses and build your strength, you WILL be able to move through them quickly where she has you going in a bit of a circuit for the first 15 minutes or so.
I got this DVD in 2003 and STILL USE IT TODAY...nearly a decade later.  That's how much I love this routine.  I do 3 weight-lifting routines throughout the week and then add this in at least once per week...twice if I have time.  It is great to do in between workout days to get the muscles loose and stretched out again.",1299456000,4,1531,4.386524822695035
1779314,4,B00006JDTH,"I actually really enjoy this dvd.  It's easy to follow as a beginner and I feel really great afterwards. If I'm stuck on a position, they have a section where you can break it down, which is a must on a dvd since the instructor isn't there in person to guide you.  She instructs pretty thoroughly during the workout but keeps the work fluid so that you don't lose momentum...and I absolutely LOVE final relaxation!  I feel like it's a treat that I've earned.  My only real gripe about this dvd is that after the 2nd Pigeon, she skips a step.  After the 1st Pigeon, she has you grab your left instep and pull your lower leg forward for a nice hip and hamstring stretch, but she doesn't have you do this with the right leg after the 2nd Pigeon.  I've had to pause the dvd and work this in myself because I really hate working one side but not the other.  I feel all...uneven.  I don't know if this was on purpose or not, but it seems silly to me.  Other than that, I find it a pleasant and easy-to-follow workout with levels to match my skill as I get better.  Once I master this dvd, it'll be time for something else.",1297296000,,1116,4.197183098591549
1779335,4,B00006JDTH,"This video has Kristin McGee as the leader. I have MTV Pilates and MTV Power Yoga with her as the instructor, and I love her. She clearly states what she is doing throughout the poses and instructs on when to breath. Both of these are very helpful when doing yoga and pilates. I have been doing yoga for about 3 years, but this video is more made for beginners. Kristin goes through basic movements and there are no poses in this video that are increasingly difficult. Therefore, I would recommend this video for beginners, but the experts should maybe go for something a little more advanced.",1277683200,,593,4.60377358490566
1779336,5,B00006JDTH,"I love this video!  If music is important to you, you'll love the great mellow but energizing music they use in the dvd.  I'd never done yoga before and this dvd makes it fun to do and gives me a great workout!  Once you've mastered the beginning version of poses, you can move on in the same video to more difficult versions.  Definitely suggest it to anyone, especially for lowering stress.",1267574400,,392,4.47887323943662
1779337,2,B00006JDTH,"I got this DVD for Christmas, and I'll have to admit, it's not one of my favorites. I am used to Bryan Kest and Rodney Yee, and I found this DVD too fast paced for a good stretch. I often have very sore muscles and like to sit in a pose for a while and work that stretch and this DVD doesn't allow that. It is a good DVD if you don't need much stretch and want a good workout sweat. I would say this is more for weight loss than relaxation.",1265587200,3,440,3.7934782608695654
1779338,4,B00006JDTH,"This is a good workout.  If that's what you're looking for, this is a good one.  If you're looking for yoga, it's ok.  Good music selection and if you know what you're doing, it's worthwhile.  If you don't know what you're doing, it might not work for you since you don't get a lot of instruction and details about the poses.  If you're new to yoga, I recommend a Rodney Yee video.  Not as ""sexy"" but you'll do things right and have a good foundation.",1264204800,,451,4.247058823529412
1779339,3,B00006JDTH,"Tonight was the first night I attempted to do this routine since I started practicing yoga in the evenings after my kids go to sleep as opposed to the early mornings.  While I did enjoy doing it in the morning, I had a totally different experience at night. I find that yoga routines that encouraged me to fully get into poses, exploring them and listening to my body are what I need in the evening.  Not quick and hurried, but calm and meditative.  Not necessarily an easy routine either but not frenetic.  I don't mind instructors talking and I don't find this instructor annoying, but the music is downright jarring and the pace is much too fast.  As a beginner, I do not jump back into downward dog from forward standing bend.  Rather I step back.  By the time I had both feet back, she had already moved to lowering to chataranga or sometimes to upward facing dog.  I felt like I would truly hurt myself if I continued.  It might just be the difference between morning and night but I think this one will definitely have to stay on the shelf for a while.",1255305600,,1059,4.38974358974359
1779340,4,B00006JDTH,I like that they show lots of modifications.  An overall good at home yoga workout.,1243296000,,83,4.533333333333333
1779341,3,B00006JDTH,"I liked the dvd but it is just a HAIR TOO FAST! I'm in fantastic shape but yoga should not be a race! It causes tension trying to keep up. It is a really good workout though. I do it less than i do my Shiva Rea Shakti yoga or Gaiam Earth, Water, Fire yoga, though. It's not my favorite but if you have dozens of dvd's it IS worth adding to your collection. It's OKAY. Just get it on sale! It does the job I just don't like how fast the sun salutations go! The rest of the dvd is fine.",1230940800,,484,3.7549019607843137
1779342,2,B00006JDTH,"I'm very surprised to see so many people commenting on what a good beginning yoga practice this DVD offers. I've been practicing yoga on and off for about 10 years, and I have to say this is potentially dangerous for someone who's never done yoga. There is almost no focus on correct posture in the poses, and the instructor spends more time saying things like, ""If you really want to go for it, try this harder variation,"" which really instills more of a sense of competing against yourself than yoga should ever involve. If you're a relatively experienced practitioner, it's a good workout, but it still annoys me whenever I do it because of the minimal focus on proper form. I would very strongly encourage someone new to yoga to go for one of the Yoga Journal DVDs, Body Wisdom media DVDs, or Gaiam's Yoga for Beginners.

If you're familiar with basic poses and proper form, however, and looking for something new and different, go for it. It's a decent vinyasa yoga workout.",1228348800,4,979,4.658959537572255
1779343,4,B00006JDTH,"I have an extensive library of yoga videos and this one is probably going to become one of my favorites! It's only 45 minutes long, but I feel great afterward -- love that there are modifications for every level -- I'm flexible in some ways but not in others so I can pick who I should follow based on how I'm feeling. Love that it's an athletic but not too new-agey (similar to the Sara Ivanhoe videos -- which are also my favorites). Definitely recommended to add to anyone's in home yoga practice.",1206057600,,500,4.387096774193548
1779344,3,B00006JDTH,"Rebecca did a great detailed review & did a great job of telling you the content of this workout.
To add my two cents:
The room has beautiful architecture & wall coverings, Kristen has 2 girls & 1 guy demonstrating at different levels from seasoned beginner to intermediate/advanced. The music is cool, but it more energizes you, hurries you along if you have limited time before you have to be somewhere which is not relaxing or calming. She even does a fast power yoga pace of warrior 1, 2 & sun salutations 3x.
Kristin has great form & body awareness & there's a hint of her true respect for the spiritual/body awareness of yoga, but this dvd is geared to more a workout/pilates/fitness session then spiritual. If you're looking for a mind/body connection, you won't find it here. She tells you when to breathe, but she seems to race through as if she was told to get it done as fast as possible w/o it being a power yoga dvd.
The moves felt great, but only because I've been doing yoga for 5 years could I still enjoy the moves & be aware of my own body & work with it instead of it just being a workout calorie burner, not enjoying the mind/body connection I get from Rodney Yee, Shiva Rea, Wai Lana, Seane Corn, Rainbeau Mars, Teigh McDonough. Yoga for Sex & The Firm's Power yoga even had more body awareness.
This is NOT for newbies or beginners because of the lack of time for true instruction to avoid injury. If you're looking for yoga only for fitness w/o body awareness, this is for you or if want something that helps keep you aware of your limited time before you have to run out, if want calmness, body awareness, check out the others listed above.",1183507200,3,1664,4.423452768729642
1779364,4,B00006JDTH,"While I'm sure this would be tons of fun if I could do it, it is really not good for beginners no matter what it says. The easy version of the pose is still pretty hard to do.  I had to go back to older tapes and work my way up again.. You have to be in shape to do this one for sure.",1181174400,4,284,3.4375
1779365,5,B00006JDTH,"I needed to add something to my running since I can't run seven days a week without getting hurt.  I had tried other DVDs but they were all really boring, MTV never fails me though, it was not boring at all, yet it wasn't a joke by any means.  Led by the yoga lady that they used on Sex and the City, this woman is popular and she knows what she's doing.  I guess I can see how the music would be distracting to some, but it's not like it's heavy metal or anything, I think the music in regular videos is boring and annoying, so I loved this!!!  I would recommend it to pretty much anyone that takes a second look at it.  If you thought, ""Yoga by MTV?  What's the world coming to?"" then it's obviously not for you, but if you became curious and thought ""That could be cool"" try it out!!  I highly recommend it!",1174521600,2,810,4.056603773584905

1779367,3,B00006JDTH,"I bought this DVD several years ago and I like the variety of the poses and difficulty level of the video.  My biggest problem with the video is that either its because of the speed of transition between poses or because one second you head is facing up and then its down, I find that I get VERY LIGHT HEADED.  Also at the end of the work out I don't really find that peaceful relaxed feeling that I get from other vidoes like Ali McGraw Total Mind and Body.  I find that I often follow my own variations of the poses that I've picked up from other videos because they sometimes feel more natural to me and sometimes I just can't do the pose in the length of time that is allowed to keep up with the instructor.  I still play this workout occasionally when I want some variety to my exercise and over all I think it's a good video.",1144713600,6,831,4.142857142857143
1779368,4,B00006JDTH,"My friend received 2 copies of this DVD for Christmas, so she gave me one, assuring me that ""no, Jen, it really is good"".  I am very skeptical of anything bearing the MTV label, but was happy to see BT did the soundtrack (I love electronic music, especially trance and progressive).

Turns out, for me, the music is the worst part of the DVD.  It is not a bad mix, but I would have preferred only non-vocal tracks.  The vocals are at best lost, at worst distracting, when you are focusing on Lori's instructions.  That said, the music can be turned off by choosing ""alternate audio track"" under the special features menu.  I do that, and then play new age-y Rasa (see my other reviews) or Krishna Das on my CD player.

The mix of poses is similiar in difficulty to an intermediate hatha yoga class or beginning ashtanga class.  If you are in fair to reasonably good shape, you can do the entire workout no problem, but you may feel tight in some poses, especially if you follow the ""advanced"" person.  The beginning, intermediate, and advanced models all demonstrate the poses effectively, and instructor Lori gives clear directions while also demonstrating the flow of postures.  Although the workout more than doable for a beginner, I feel it challenging enough for an intermediate yogi or yogini.  Advanced folks may want to use this vinyasa (flow of poses) as a warm-up, and then add postures, such as shoulder stand, headstand, scorpion, and the like.  There are no inverted poses.  As another reviewer remarked, there was an error in not repeating the pigeon variation for the alternate side, but no big deal.

A nice special feature of the DVD are the stills that break down the poses.  This section serves as a proper introduction for newbees, or a refresher for returnees.

All in all, a solid DVD that exceeded my expectations.",1139616000,4,1837,4.7115987460815045

I did struggle through it the first, second, and maybe third time learning the positions, but once you get a good general idea of the video it's easy to follow, with variations on the positions as you advance. The music is good, and it really improved my flexibility. Paired with cardio (in my case, swimming) I think it could be a great variation from a normal workout routine. Within about a month (maybe a little more) I could do most of the second (and much harder) MTV yoga DVD. I think it's important to stress, though, that I feel this DVD is best suited for beginners - for those with a lot of previous yoga experience it could prove too easy or too tedious.",1138406400,4,819,4.324675324675325

1779374,4,B00006JDTH,"As someone that has been doing Yoga for over 10 years, this one was way too easy for me, however, I realy liked it as a whole package for Extreme Beginners.

It does move a little quickly, but after you do it a couple of times and know which poses are coming next, you will have no trouble flowing.

View the DVD all the way through before you follow it for the first time... it has pose instruction at the end. The instruction would better benefit you if they were at the beginning, but you will only need to view it a couple of times if you've never done Yoga before.

The music is OK... use the DVD's ""Voice Only"" feature and put on a CD from your music collection instead.

I'm an intermediate yogi who has had over a year of experience and practices at least 3 times a week (at home or at a studio), and I still find this DVD to be a great home workout.  This is definitely a good buy.",1109721600,2,607,4.162393162393163

It was like ""drop and give me a pose"" now jump up and give me another. I wasn't even in my pose before they had moved on to the next. It was more an aerobic video than a yoga video.",1107561600,6,301,3.71875
1779377,1,B00006JDTH,"Background on me: I'm 33 years old, been practicing yoga off and on for about 3 years (classes and videos) and have practiced consistently for the last 6 months.  I'd consider myself in the intermediate category and use yoga to stretch and relax but consider it a bonus if I can get a good workout at the same time.

As for the MTV Yoga DVD:

Positives: None.

Negatives: My main complaint is the speed of the poses.  It moved extremely fast -- so fast that my sticky mat was rumpling up and moving with me.  The breathing instruction was also very fast, probably to keep in sync with the pose changes.  The instruction was alright -- if you aren't new to yoga -- but I just couldn't keep up and feel like I was performing the poses correctly.

The fastest yoga workout I've come across was Rodney Yee's ""Power Yoga: the complete workout""...until now!  So if you liked that video, you'll love this one.

Also, this is not a good workout for beginners.  If you are a beginner, start with a slower workout that shows you how to position yourself correctly (most of the Sara Ivanhoe vids are good) and then move on to more advanced practices like this one if you really want to sweat.",1105401600,12,1181,4.421296296296297
1779378,4,B00006JDTH,"I love this workout.  This was my first experience with yoga, and I truly believe that this video had a lot to do with my sticking with it for this long.  Kristin McGee is an awesome instructor.  She's down-to-earth, encouraging, and she knows what she's talking about:)  She gives very detailed instruction, and she explains what to do for all levels.  At the end she goes over a few poses that you may have had a problem with.  The ONLY thing wrong with this DVD (and it's a small thing) is that during one of the poses (pigeon pose, I believe) she does it on one side, but forgets to do it on the other side.  But like I said, it's a trivial thing, and I only noticed it after I did the workout a few times.  You won't be disappointed with this video.",1104278400,,754,4.1875
1779379,3,B00006JDTH,"The yoga on this DVD is merely OK.  It is not vigorous enough to be a truly challenging power yoga workout (for such a practice, please try Bryan Kest's Power Yoga 3 ""Sweat"" or Baron Baptiste's Journey Into Power 3), it is not fluid enough to be considered hatha yoga (for such a practice, please try anything by Shiva Rea or the excellent Yoga Mind and Body featuring Ali McGraw and Erich Schiffman), and it is not contemplative enough to be considered a meditation practice (for such a practice please try Power Yoga with Rodney Yee, Yoga for Strength and Energy by Gaiam or Candlelight Yoga with Sara Ivanhoe).  What you wind up with is a sort of ""hip yoga"" featuring all of the athletic elements of yoga, but nothing really instructive about the practice itself.

In order to really practice yoga, you must engage your bandas and practice ujjayi breathing technique.  If you are not doing those things, then you are simply performing intense stretches and simple gymnastics.  There is nothing wrong with intense stretching and simple gymnastics per se, it just is not yoga.

I generally use my yoga practice as a form of meditation.  Consequently, I found the soundtrack jarring and terribly distracting.

It is a decent DVD, but I do not recommend it overall since there are better ones out there, especially for the home based practitioner.",1100044800,6,1346,4.796536796536796
1779380,5,B00006JDTH,"I love love love this DVD!  For a while, I had been wanting to try yoga, but wasn't really sure where to start.  I saw this, and decided to buy it just because I wouldn't really lose anything.  (NOTE:  I was a complete beginner when I started this DVD.  All I'd known of yoga was perhaps, looking at the poses in magazine articles, etc.)  Definitely not a disappointing buy.  This gives a pleasant yoga workout using mostly basic moves, and a few more advanced ones.  It has nice music going throughout it, which is good considering it's made by MTV, but it also has the feature on the DVD to turn the music off, which is nice if you're one who doesn't like the style featured.  The instructor, Kristin Mcgee, is very personable and she makes sure to explain all the moves well, and also reminds the viewer to keep breathing throughout.  This can be used by inexperienced people as well as those who are more advanced.  They show how to do the move the regular way, then they have a way to do it for beginners, and then for more advanced.  This is a very good idea.  I've seen good results from doing this workout regularly, but a nice thing about it is you don't think you're really working out until the next day when you're sore.  I don't understand why a lot of the reviews say that the pace is too fast/difficult/only for advanced.  As I stated before, I was a complete beginner as far as yoga was concerned.  However, I was moderately fit and quite flexible due to dancing, so maybe that is why I found it gave me exactly the type of workout I was looking for.  Never had trouble keeping up, and this is without knowing the moves beforehand.  I think this is because McGee does a very good job of explaining all of the moves.  If you're interested in trying yoga, and want great music to go along with it, I definitely recommend this.",1088467200,4,1840,4.358823529411764

It is difficult at first if you've never done yoga before, but if you keep trying to do it it gets easier. I am POSITIVE I will see results from this if I keep it up. Not only does it give muscles you never knew you had a workout, but it's relaxing also. I also like that it has different levels you can move to as you progress on the same DVD.",1087948800,,587,3.6666666666666665
1779382,5,B00006JDTH,"Ok, I heard MTV and Yoga in the same sentence and I thought ""oxymoron"". I really had the lowest of low expectations, assuming that the poses would be wrongly named, poorly executed, etc. I thought the use of Lori Trespicio from The Real World NYC as a ""host"" would be eye-roll worthy. The promise of background music from a great DJ (he did the soundtrack for the movie ""Go"") actually was off-putting in this setting.

I was surprised on all counts. I've been a student of yoga for years and the poses were named correctly and executed properly, the instruction was clear and easy to follow. Lori was really in the background and didn't speak throughout the whole thing (she was just used as an example of a beginner) so her presence was absolutely unnecessary and a weird selling point. The instructor, Kristin, turned me off at first. Her claim that the DVD wouldn't be like the yoga most people think of with it's ""hokey new age music"" put the fear into me (I like the music most of my yoga studios play). However, I actually found the soundtrack pleasantly inconspicuous (and loved that it can be turned off so all you hear is the instructor- I can put on my own background music, a nice touch.) The poses were all familiar, and I liked Kristin's elaboration of important points. Honestly, Kristin was as good as some yoga instructors I have had. I definitely warmed to her presence.

Be forewarned that you need a yoga mat before beginning this. I also think savasana(final relaxation) needs to be longer, so you might consider lowering the lights and pausing/stopping the video when it gets to this point (and If you have one, a nice eve bag doesn't hurt!)

It's a great way to stretch the muscles & work towards flexability.
This was my first yoga dvd ever, and even as a beginner I find myself able to do everything through out the dvd.
The instructor talks enough to let you know what your doing, but not too much to where all you here is talking.
There are also options on the dvd such as showing you slowly how each step is done.

1779384,4,B00006JDTH,"a very good offering from MTV that has become my ""go to"" tape for at-home practise.  it should appeal to yogi's of all levels -- it's not too easy, which is a pitfall many ""beginner"" yoga programs fall into as viewers advance quickly beyond basic pose explanations. if someone needs more basic pose instruction, this is handled nicely by an added segment outside of the program itself which reviews important poses like downward dog.
the length of the program is approximately 40 minutes, which i think is perfect for at-home practise, because i find that longer programs are more difficult to get through when you're on your own without an instructor.  i always feel like i get the stretch i need and i feel better after doing this program. my one nitpicky criticism is the oversight they make in doing ""screaming pigeon"" on the left-side, but forgetting to do it on the right-side. it surprises me they don't at least make an attempt to edit this in later.",1082332800,,958,4.696428571428571

Among the pros for this one is: once it gets going it is fast paced. The cons though are: way too short. I think there is a total of 20 minutes of hard workout which is not enough for a good yoga session - should be at least 45-50 minutes to go through more poses. I also purchased the MTV power yoga and that one goes to the point faster and I like it better - however it is still not long enough. If you are in good shape and want something decent - do not buy this one - buy the MTV Power Yoga one as both of them have the same basic stuff.

The camera work isn't good enough for a workout video let alone yoga so Kristin's good cueing is doubly valuable. The music sounds like muzak to me but each to his or her own and it's easy to switch it off. The nightclub setting is a drawback because it really is too dark. It almost looks like a pub! It's great to see intermediate and advanced yoga videos on the market but they need to be clearly labelled.

  it features the vinyasa flowing style of yoga where one pose flows into another.  Hosted by Lori (from RW- back to new york) who is the beginner and shows easier modifications to the poses.  there is another woman and a guy who show intermediate and advanced poses--this is great so that this workout can continue to evolve with your experience level and flexibility.
  the instructor, kristin, is quite good- she is not obtrusive or annoying and is a very good ""breath"" coach.  she reminds you to breath in/out at the appropriate times and does each pose with 1 breath intervals which makes the yoga flow and seem faster paced.  I definately thought this made it more cardio than most yoga tapes.

**standing poses (triangle/warrior 1/2/side angle pose)
**floor work (pigeon pose/child's pose/prayer)
**balance (tree/standing y or warrior 3)

Most workout videos have a tendency of getting old and boring at some point, but the music and the sequence of this makes it a workout you can do everyday for, literally, years.  There are three different levels (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) that you can follow along with in this DVD and all of them, while challenging, make you feel like you can aspire to them.  This is not a slow, hatha yoga workout, but instead is a more fast-paced, vinyasa yoga.  The beginning of the program moves quickly to raise your heart rate and warm up your muscles while the second half of the workout moves you deeper into the poses and really gets you to stretch.  The music is relaxing but also keeps you moving at a decent pace and doesn't seem to get boring.  The decor in the yoga studio that is used for this set puts you into the mood to do your yoga practice.  The workout is about 45 minutes long and you feel refreshed but still as if you got a good workout in after you are finished.  One thing I really liked in the workout that a lot of yoga workouts do not have is that Kristin McGee will teach you how to breathe properly for yoga.  Yogic breathing is different that the breathing that we do every day, so it is important to learn how to do it effectively.  McGee is a wonderful yoga teacher that provides instruction that makes you confident in the poses.  I really can't recommend this program enough.  I think this has the potential to relax you, but also get you into shape while allowing you to enjoy your practice.  This would be good for a beginner, and intermediate or a more advanced intermediate that is striving to become more advanced.",1458345600,,1779,4.3545454545454545

7969960,4,B00006JDTH,"I'm a beginner when it comes to yoga, so I can't really compare this to other yoga programs; however, I enjoyed this workout. I do think that some of the sequences moved pretty quickly so I would recommend watching the video before doing the workout to know what's coming. There are 3 people doing the workout to show three levels, beginner, moderate and advanced. I recommend this for the beginner and anyone interested in adding yoga to their workout routine.",1451865600,,461,4.775
7969961,5,B00006JDTH,I've purchased 3-5 copies of this DVD over time because I keep losing them in moves but I just love how it transforms my body in such a short amount of time. Great for newbies and advanced yogis.,1442534400,,195,4.157894736842105

7969963,5,B00006JDTH,"Someone gave me this DVD years ago and I'm so glad they did, as I would never have naturally gravitated towards an MTV yoga workout. I immediately loved it. I have been doing this workout on and off for about 10 yrs and still it's my go-to yoga DVD. The setting is serene-- not a bright beach but a Zen, kind of dark eastern style room. I personally like the music but you can turn it off. The workout itself is not too hard but not too easy. It's just right and leaves you feeling that you got a good workout in. It's about 45 minutes which is great when you're feeling guilty about a quick 30 minute workout but just not up for 60 minutes or pressed for time. Kristin's pacing is great and she walks you through the poses. Her tone is calm and relaxing while she's coaching you through the routine. I've purchased other yoga, barre, ballet and pilates DVDs just to change things up over the years, but here I am back  watching my favorite of the lot. Her other DVDs are great, too.",1422489600,,983,4.2287234042553195
7969964,5,B00006JDTH,"I bought this Yoga video many years ago.  Since then I've tried many other videos and practices, and this is still one of my favorites.  If you get tired of the music go to special features on the DVD and select alternate audio track, that's just the instructions minus the music.  I'd highly recommend this video for athletes, beginners, and anyone who thinks most Yoga videos are weird (you have to watch them to know what I mean).",1408752000,,433,4.5256410256410255
7969965,5,B00006JDTH,"I bought this video when it was released on vhs. Then when I got a dvd player, I had to buy the dvd version. I've been using this video off an on for 11 years. It's a great video, great workout, and it never gets old. Love it!",1383955200,,226,3.7291666666666665
