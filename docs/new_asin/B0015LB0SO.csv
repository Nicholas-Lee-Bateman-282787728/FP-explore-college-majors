8258928,4,B0015LB0SO,"T.S. Slaughter's film is probably the most in-your-face bad taste gay film I've ever seen, and I really enjoyed it.  The acting is wonderfully subpar (and recalls early John Waters), the humor all over the place, and the screenplay a punch in the face to the politically correct.  Nathan and Justin are ""roommates with benefits"" that are bored of their college lives and decide to get even with the ""Ivy"" boys by abducting, raping and killing them.  Michael Burke is particularly wonderful as Justin -- his line ""You're awesome, Nathan!"" becomes funnier every time he delivers it.  This is certainly not a film for everyone (the easily offended need not apply), but based on sheer audacity alone Skull & Bones is a must-see for viewers with alternative tastes.  If you like touching tales of coming out and loving gay relationships, this is a must-avoid!",1219622400,3,854,4.902777777777778
8258929,1,B0015LB0SO,"This movie was so bad (on every level) that I think every copy should be taken out in a field somewhere and burned. The acting was bad. The plot was disgusting and pointless. I have absolutely nothing good to say about this waste of time. I bought this movie because it wasn't available for rent anywhere, and I immediately turned around and sold it after only one viewing. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie like the plague. If you want a good gay-themed horror movie check out ""Hellbent,"" ""Make a Wish,"" ""Socket,"" ""The Gay Bed and Breakfast of Terror,"" ""Fraternity Massacre on Hell Island,"" ""Creatures from the Pink Lagoon,"" ""Dead Boyz Don't Scream,"" ""Dante's Cove,"" or ""The Lair"" instead. All of those movies are better than this trash.",1219104000,3,745,4.7384615384615385
