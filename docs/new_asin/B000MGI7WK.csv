2732799,5,B000MGI7WK,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I wish they would re-digitalize it.  Not the clearest picture.  However, the movie kept my attention.  Also liked the music.  It takes you right there to Ireland.  The actors all did a great job.  A very good movie.  It had all the elements for a good movie, drama, mystery, some humor, young love (had to overlook the cursing).  I think most people would enjoy this movie.",1479772800,,403,4.563380281690141

2732856,5,B000MGI7WK,"This is a gentle, funny movie about what it means to be a family and how we overcome long held hurts and resentments, fears, regrets, and guilt to do so.  The Irish scenery is spectacular, showcasing both the beauty of family and the isolation within it.  The main characters and the well-drawn secondary ones will steal your heart away and make you long to spend even more time in a small Irish village where ""as you are"" acceptance is the basic currency of life.",1421539200,,464,4.511904761904762

2732899,4,B000MGI7WK,I loved this movie and that is why I bought it. It is hard to find at any movie rentals and online or store. I really enjoyed watching it!,1400112000,,138,3.793103448275862
2732900,4,B000MGI7WK,The Nephew was a enjoyable film with minimal bad language. The Irish scenes were beautiful.  Recommend to those that enjoy family films.,1395187200,,136,5.181818181818182
2732901,4,B000MGI7WK,"Could find this movie on DVD to save my life. Have it on video, but couldn't find it on DVD. Thank you Amazon for making this a streaming video. Hill Harper is great, and this is the first movie I ever saw him in, and of course Pierce Brosnan is great too.",1394755200,,256,3.9423076923076925
2732902,4,B000MGI7WK,"This story is about Love, acceptance and how time changes people perspectives. To me, the writer is saying that it will take generations before all humans accept the fact that We are just  one big family.  It's good move, but something is missing.",1394236800,,247,4.72093023255814

2732904,5,B000MGI7WK,This is an all time favorite movie in our family. We watch it a couple times a year or more.,1390176000,,92,3.65
2732905,5,B000MGI7WK,I have loved it since owning the obsolete videotape and was so pleased to find it on DVD.  The song at a stranger's wake may have been a tribute to the boy's own parent,1382745600,,168,3.9411764705882355

Bronson at his best.",1374883200,,102,3.857142857142857

2732919,3,B000MGI7WK,"This is a nice movie, undemanding and sweet. This best parts are the great shots of the Irish landscape and the accents of most of the actors.",1370908800,,142,4.296296296296297

2732921,5,B000MGI7WK,I love the movie; it's a good family movie; we don't c to many family movies today; I just wished we could purchase it on dvd,1364947200,,125,3.8461538461538463
2732922,1,B000MGI7WK,"The 1 star is for fast delivery. Otherwise, I'd give zero for lack of information. Not knowing what region 1 or 2 meant, I accidentally ordered the wrong one and of course it will not play. Now I have to go thru the trouble of sending it back which I don't think I should have to pay for.",1362441600,,288,3.9827586206896552
2732923,5,B000MGI7WK,"I LOVED this movie, and everything about it. But then again I'm of Irish heritage and love anything and everything ""IRISH"". I've seen a lot of movies that have been filmed in Ireland and this one by far still after years of having seen it, still moves me. The storyline was excellent and the actors in it are wonderful. This is ""NOT"" a B rate movie with B rate acting, it was a great movie and I WISH I could find it to own and it work in a dvd player that would play it.(Since amazon stated it only works in ""certain"" types of dvd players), must be something to do with the format on it(???). It's been years since I've seen this movie and I would ""absolutely"" love to own it and be able to see it whenever I wanted. I was pregnant with my daughter when I first saw it, and from this movie, it inspired me to give my daughter her name. :)",1360108800,,839,4.0602409638554215
2732924,5,B000MGI7WK,"So, this was the most expensive purchase that I have ever made, but the priced dropped right before Christmas.  The film is incredible, the brogue is heavy and thick, so you may have to listen to things several times in certain areas.  However, the story, the actors play there parts most superbly.  Hill Harper takes the oxygen right out of the room with his performance at the wake.  Pierce Brosnan plays his part, rather than stealing the show, he is just powerful and charismatic beyond bringing the warmth to such challenging issues of despair.  I really think that this is one of the missed GEMS in cinematic history.  It is a must see...  One film left to complete my must haves, and that is 1980-81 release of ""Endless Love"" Brooke Shields first film...  It is only in Europe for some reason, maybe I will get fortunate one day!",1356912000,,836,4.601351351351352
2732925,2,B000MGI7WK,"I saw this movie when my son was 6, he is now 22.  This movie is just wonderful.  We often don't think of our background and where we come from.  It was beautiful acted and the film was just beautiful.  It was a shame that it was never seen on the big screen for long. I have tried to edit this to give it a 5 star rating but amazon won't let me so I will say it in my review.  5 starts!!!!",1332633600,,390,3.6506024096385543
2732926,5,B000MGI7WK,I've waited a long time to get this movie. It has been so expensive. But this one was a great price. I'm really happy with it. My husband actually laughed at some of the scenes- he's not much of a movie lover! I recommend this one!,1323302400,,231,4.043478260869565
2732927,5,B000MGI7WK,"This movie was recommended to me a few years ago by several people, and they were so correct. Wonderful story about forgiveness, families, and love. The backdrop is an island in Ireland, and with such beauty, it literally took my breath away. The lead actors are superb, and with such a great supporting cast, I felt myself caring about every character. I purchased this so that I could loan it to friends who would appreciate a real treat. And I've gotten many ""thank you!, thank you! s from those that have borrowed it. I would also like to purchase the soundtrack; the music was one of a kind. Bravo to the producers of this film, and give us more!",1307059200,,651,4.4789915966386555
2732938,1,B000MGI7WK,"make sure to buy from dealers you've had success with, stay away from the rest. you could get ripped off. we sure did.",1306368000,,118,4.173913043478261
2732939,5,B000MGI7WK,"I loved this movie and told my sister how wonderful it was. Something about it just touches your heart, beautifully done and filmed. HOWEVER, she got it for me but when it arrived it would not play. I found out that it was in PAL format for the UK. Now THIS one seems to be in the US format! What the hey? I wish they had this available (a few months ago) when she ordered it. As it is I can only play it on my computer. How do I get an exchange Amazon?

Other than that I thought it was one of the best movies I had seen in a long time. Wonderful acting, characters and plot not to mention the gorgeous scenery. My favorites were the two young sons of Mrs O'Boyce, they added a great bit of humor as they tried their best to emulate ""the American"".The hired hand, Patsy, was great as he offered his rendition of rap, Irish style.

Probably the best line in the film was when Brenda says ""we've all done things we shouldn't have""..ain't it the truth.

Whoever the person who wrote the scathing one star review was...I can only what kind of film they DO like to call this one silly. I thought you had to be over 13 to write a review...so sorry for them.",1293494400,,1152,4.111111111111111
2732940,5,B000MGI7WK,"I heard about this movie from a friend about a year ago.  Familiar with a few of the actors, (Hill Harper) in the film I was excited to see it.  It was not a disappointment! Having Irish ancestry and not knowing much about it I was very curious to see how the film would pan out.  It was wonderful how the film focused on the characteristics that connect all of us. The issue of race was minor as this family became acquainted with one another.  The scenery  of Ireland was breathtaking. It is a yes for family, students and any film buff who enjoys a film that leaves you feeling good about people.",1290038400,,599,4.265486725663717
2732941,4,B000MGI7WK,"This movie was wonderful. An early intro to Hill Harper who has gone on to star in movies such as The Skulls and hits like CSI:NY.  I digress, this movie presents a wonderful journey of one young man to find his roots and honor is mother's dying wishes. In the process, he finds himself and others are forced to take a journey within as well. Add to that the backdrop of the lovely Irish landscape (and a haircut scene that is one of the most tastefully sexy things I've ever seen) and you've got yourself a treat for a lazy Sunday afternoon.",1267488000,,542,4.313725490196078
2732942,4,B000MGI7WK,"Maybe this caught me in the right mood or something, but I could not help but be charmed by this gentle Irish melodrama.  The story is set in a tourist-board-pretty Irish cove.  Into this small community a young coloured American boy comes `home'.. his mother left Ireland before he was born.  Now she has passed away and he comes to stay with his uncle.  All is not well however, as his return brings to the surface buried past stories and tensions mount, and his blossoming romance with Aislan, the young red-haired beauty of the island makes confrontation unavoidable.
It is fairly lightweight, but never frivolous in tone.  Brosnan's role is not central - indeed it is Hill Harper as the young American who impresses, staying somehow remarkably gentle and neutral while never being a pushover, and Aislan McGuckin certainly makes his falling in love perfectly believable.  It's this romance being as believable as it is, with such unforced chemistry, that helps the films succeed at its core, helping to offset the somewhat less credible backstory that unravels as the film progresses.  On the fringes, what makes it more memorable are the throwaway moments we see in the background.  Two nun's fly fishing, the postman cycling his rounds, the awkwardness of the attempts to bring some modern touch to the church service.. these all help give the character needed to avoid becoming a tourist fluff piece.  And it succeeds for the most part.
Combine this gentle melodrama with the achingly beautiful Irish scenery, and an eclectic soundtrack with everything from Thin Lizzy to Elton John, via several beautiful Irish ballads, and this gets a thumbs up from me for a quiet night in.",1248307200,,1684,4.943262411347518
2732943,4,B000MGI7WK,"This is about a young man who is not what you would expect, goes to Ireland to spread his mother's ashes.  He stays with his uncle, who is the main reason his mother went to America.  The uncle set in his ways and secrets, gives the young man a hard time.  There is also a girl involve.  Her father is the ex-lover of the boy's mother. It is a good movie where everyone has a lesson to learn. It is not just another love story. Well worth ever penny.  Especially because Pierce Brosnan is in it.",1242432000,,495,4.114583333333333
2732944,5,B000MGI7WK,"This is one of those movies that I will be able to watch once a year for the rest of my life.  Plot, casting, cinematography, music, and location all combine to create an excellent viewing experience.  It is a shame that this DVD is only available used.
The camerawork isn't up to the level of Archie Stout's in, ""The Quiet Man,"" but the casting is almost as good.  Spend the $35 to get it used, and enoy!",1238544000,,405,4.233766233766234
2732945,3,B000MGI7WK,"How can a movie produced by and starring Pierce Brosnan at the height of his James Bond fame not get a wide theatrical release?  This is the sweet story of a young Black man from America who journeys to Ireland after his  mother's death to complete her last wish and winds up caught in the events that drove her away decades earlier when he starts a romance with the daughter of his mother's former love (Pierce Brosnan).  Better than Brosnan's other Irish effort, Evelyn, that's for sure.",1237248000,,489,4.597701149425287
2732946,1,B000MGI7WK,"The premise of this movie sounds good, but it doesn't deliver.
Basically, teen goes to see his deceased mother's family then
is only interested in a local girl. Just a really silly movie.",1232323200,,187,4.696969696969697
2732947,5,B000MGI7WK,This movie is set in Ireland. The scenery and the villiage are beautiful. A man who has not seen his sister in 20 years recieves a letter that she is dying and sending her son to Ireland. it is lots of conflict and finding out why the Mother left Ireland and the uncle and nephew growing to like each other. I loved it!,1225584000,,319,4.079365079365079
2732959,5,B000MGI7WK,This is one of the best movies.  It speaks to human nature on many levels.  It teaches valuable lessons.  It is engaging.  Made me want to visit Ireland!  I have come to respect the work of Hill Harper after being introduced to this actor in this film.,1198368000,,252,4.276595744680851
2732960,5,B000MGI7WK,"I love Ireland. Great movie. And I too love the ""whiskey in the jar"" rendition. Good movie for snuggling in on a cold rainy day with someone special.",1191628800,,149,4.357142857142857
2732961,5,B000MGI7WK,"This is a movie that I can recommend to anyone.  Cross-culturalism, subtle racism, love and family.  It's all here, the budget, I suppose was not the biggest for the film, but Pierce Brosnan and the rest make the most of what they had to work with!  Five stars!!",1171411200,,262,4.416666666666667
2732962,5,B000MGI7WK,"My cousin who caught this movie on some cable channel told me about it and thought I would get a kick out of it (I'm African-American and dating an Irish man).  I have always been a tremendous fan of Hill Harper's work...As well as a long time fan of Pierce Brosnan, so I was expecting  good performances.  However I must say, this film far exceeded my expectations so much I must simply say BRAVO!!!

While the movie at its core was somewhat predictable and formulaic it was superbly and touchingly acted.  I particularly enjoyed the tensions in the relationship betwen Chad and his uncle.  The cinematography and musical score were wonderful...made me feel like I was in Ireland (which is a stunningly beautiful country).  Highly recommend it.",1162771200,,745,4.818897637795276
2732963,5,B000MGI7WK,"This is one of those movies that sneaks up on you and you think it's going to be an ok movie and it turns into grabbing all of your attention. The story is one you've might of heard before, a woman has a child with a man of a different race but the difference is that the woman is from Ireland. What makes the movie more intense is that her all grown up African American son wants to know more about his Irish background. When he arrives it's a warm welcome and a very very cold one as well. Hill is overwhelmed with the pressures of having a guy that hates him because of a girl who loves him and loving the home of his mother but having to soon leave. The nephew is a great movie from beginning to end with some interesting changes.",1137628800,,734,4.068965517241379
2732964,5,B000MGI7WK,A real sleeper. 5 stars all the way. Also has one of the funniest short segments in a movie I've ever seen. Suprised no one else mentioned this. Superb acting by all.,1130284800,,166,4.21875
2732965,5,B000MGI7WK,"""The Nephew"" is a concise story about the arrival of ""the nephew"" on a small island off the Irish coast after his mother has died in New York City. [His father died when he was a child, and is not an issue in the story.] There are some racial issues addressed, but they are not the focus of the story, as racial differences in Ireland and the U.K. do not elicit the same reactions as in America.  The focus of the story is really what happened more than twenty years earlier, when Karen, ""the nephew's"" mother, left the island for America, despite her passionate love affair with the character played by Pierce Brosnan, who has not heard from her in all that time.

  The ""uncle,"" Uncle Tony, is Karen's brother, a lonely, silent and bitter man, who cannot deal with the memories brought to the surface--although it is plain that those memories were never very far beneath it--by the presence of Chad Egan-Washington, his nephew.  The movie is filled with wonderful ""characters"": Tony's farm worker, who is also a singer; the ""twins,"" two of the most precious children ever to  inhabit a movie screen; and others too numerous to mention.  I have also refrained from mentioning some of the players, as to do so would reveal some of the secrets before they ripen.  Although Pierce Brosnan is given ""star billing,"" he actually plays a ""character role"" here, and to his credit, he does not make the movie his own; as indeed, it really belongs to Chad and Uncle Tony--both of whom give superb performances--as well as to the absent Karen.

  This is a short movie, but a jewel, nonetheless; and one which can be watched many times in order to capture all of its beauty.  That beauty includes a magnificent Irish score, and a background of countryside and ocean of such loveliness that you will never tire of seeing it.  The best part is that neither the countryside nor the story overwhelms the other.  If I could give this movie six stars, I would do so!",1126656000,,1950,4.598265895953757
2732966,3,B000MGI7WK,"This is a drama with an interesting storyline, and the major theme in the movie is about resolving relationships that were damaged in the past.  Sadly, the obsessive use of religious exclamations (Jesus' name was used about 9 times) spoiled this movie for me. It's too bad the screen writer decided to do this, because it took away from a very gripping storyline.  The other more mild swearing was kept to a minimum.

Donal McCann stars as Tony who receives a letter from his sister on her death bed, asking him to take care of her son.  When Chad, played by the handsome Hill Harper, arrives, everyone is surprised that he has dark skin.  People in the Irish town welcome Chad into their community somewhat hesitantly, but they soon realize he is his ""mother's son"".  Chad develops a romantic friendship with the daughter of his mother's past sweetheart, played by Pierce Brosnan, which causes tension between all the characters involved. Things are not helped any when Chad, who is a talented artist, draws a picture of his Love as how he imagined she would look in the nude.  Relationships will not be healed and the heart of the problems resolved, until the many secrets, including those Tony has of his own, are brought to light.

Hill Harper does an outstanding acting job and he has a pretty good singing voice as well.  The scenes of the Irish countryside are beautiful.",1125187200,,1378,4.708333333333333

2732968,4,B000MGI7WK,"I caught this movie one day on cable, intrigued by the idea of an African-American man returning to his Irish mother's homeland.  It would be easy for this film to use the idea of a young black man coming to Ireland and the sort of upheval that might bring, but instead the film focuses on the tortured family history of the characters.  In fact, the color of the newphew's skin is barely mentioned (twice I think).  Hill Harper as the nephew, Chad, and Donal McCann as his uncle Tony shine in this film.  Their performances are dramatic, tortured, and heart-wrenching at times.  The rest of the all Irish cast, including Pierce Brosnan, are wonderful, as well.  If you're looking for a great drama featuring wonderful acting and the beautiful landscape of Ireland, then check out this film.",1110067200,,791,4.737226277372263
2732979,3,B000MGI7WK,The other reviewers deal with the story. It's memorable for me because of two things. First is a rap version of Whiskey in the Jar. Second is the camera's absolute love affair with the Irish landscape. This film gets you as close to Ireland as you can get without setting foot on the soil. The land steals the show and is enough in itself to recommend the film.,1109980800,,361,4.323529411764706
2732980,4,B000MGI7WK,"This is not a subject I've seen dealt with before.  Pierce Brosnan stars in this story about an Irish man's sister who runs off to America and marries a black man. The woman has a son and when she dies, he has no where to go but to Ireland to live with his uncle.  He carries his mother's ashes with him.  The people in the Irish town find him and oddity but some folks take to him immediately.  It appears that black people are not well liked in Ireland even if they are half Irish.

The nephew developes a relationship with a young girl but her father is dead set against it.  There is hostility between the girl's father and the young man's uncle.  Much later it's revealed that the young girls father (Brosnan) use to be in love with the boy's mother and he was the reason that she ran away.  Unbeknownst to Brosnan's character, the boy's uncle had a hand in making sure that the lovers were kept apart.

There are some very touching tender moments here and I reccomend this film highly.  I hope you try it.  It's very different from anything you've ever seen and quite interesting.  Enjoy!",1101427200,,1094,4.361386138613861
2732981,4,B000MGI7WK,"This film is a vivid depiction of life in Ireland and the long-term affections and alienations that can form in a rural, isolated area.  A man whose sister had run off to American years ago finds out she has died and her son is coming to visit the only family he has left. Pierce Brosnan is the sister's left-behind lover and although not one of the central characters, he gives a memorial performance. There is a racial element in the movie which only heightens the drama but primarily the film focuses on hard hearts coming to love again.",1094428800,,540,4.510204081632653

8168806,5,B000MGI7WK,"I have searched for this movie for years and I finally have a copy.  It covers race relations very well.  Mainly it is about a biracial young man who lost his mother and father.  His mother is Irish and his father is African American.  He travels to a small community in Ireland to live with his mother's family.  The fun part is that they don't know that he is part African American from Brooklyn no less.

Everyone accepts him and two young boys are fascinated with his dress, hair and characteristics and attempts to mimic his every move.",1505952000,,541,4.469387755102041

8168808,5,B000MGI7WK,a riveting story of emotion and courage. A young man who has lost all of his family in America travels to Ireland only to find a warped prejudiced uncle period one has to admire him for standing up for himself and in so doing he wins the admiration of the neighbors and ultimately his uncle. Great story.,1495929600,,304,4.350877192982456
8168809,5,B000MGI7WK,"This was one of Hill Harper's and Pierce Brosnan's turn-of-the-century movies that I enjoyed so much, I was afraid to admit to my buddies that I had even seen it.  Between you and me, this was a terrific movie.  One would have thought the movie was about racial prejudice.  On the contrary.  It was about family secrets and lies.  It was also about forgiveness and love.  It's a great family movie (even for a guy).",1490400000,,415,4.466666666666667
