5751809,5,B00CYI4KCA,the best story I've seen in a long time. I wish this was still at the movies but I'm enjoying it on DVD,1388966400,,103,3.5217391304347827
5751810,1,B00CYI4KCA,"Was sorry to have wasted my time.  I was disappointed.  Tried it based on some of the reviews, but would not recommend it.",1388880000,,122,4.260869565217392
5751811,5,B00CYI4KCA,"This is a very funny movie the whole family can enjoy. Well directed and acted. The subtitle translations are not 100% accurate, but some saying lose their meaning when translated anyways. We need more movies like this!",1388448000,,219,4.945945945945946
5751812,5,B00CYI4KCA,Great comedy made me laugh and Granpa Matsak is the best character. It is nice to see an ethnic movie targeted for the American Diaspora to enjoy. I can only hope they make more movies with Grandpa Matsak,1383696000,4,204,4.394736842105263
5751813,5,B00CYI4KCA,"I really liked this movie.  Recommend it to everyone I know.

Very funny movie but I'm Armenian so I just listened to them in Armenian.",1379980800,,135,4.36
5751814,4,B00CYI4KCA,"a pleasant diversion, if you're unfamiliar with Armenia. a goofy but decent American on vacation on the Black Sea Coast goes out for parasailing against his better judgement, then the cable breaks, he gets snagged by a passing small plane and the next thing you know, he lands in a barn somewhere in Armenia. It takes quite a while to realize hes not in Turkey anymore, and by using the little Turkish he picked up at the hotel, manages to convince the villagers, hes a Turkish/Azeri spy. No one speaks English, including the one man in the village who claims he does. But of course, he is eventually saved by the prettiest girl in the village back from school in Yerevan. lots of good character actors as the local villagers, who start out full of suspicion, but of course end up in a different place. Wont win any prizes from Turks or Azeris for cultural sensitivity though. Hits lots of Armenian themes that youll hear all over Armenia. worth watching.",1378512000,7,955,4.623529411764705
5751815,5,B00CYI4KCA,"A gem of a picture, capturing the more humorous characteristics of
the inhabitants of an unsophisticated village caught up in a comedy
of errors and misunderstandings. Has a little bit of everything, romance,
compassion, cameraderie,and just plain fun. Don't miss it!",1375833600,5,267,5.536585365853658
5751816,5,B00CYI4KCA,"Although the language is stated as English above, most of the dialogue is in Armenian - with subtitles. I don't speak Armenian, although I know a lot about the culture being married to an Armenian, and I found the movie to be highly amusing and entertaining.  However, my Armenian speaking family were in hysterics through much of the movie.  I gather that the subtitles do not translate the Armenian humor very well. Some may view it as stereotyping Armenian villagers in a negative way, but you need that kind of exaggerated character portrayal for slapstick comedy to work.",1373932800,14,576,4.86734693877551
5751817,4,B00CYI4KCA,"I liked Lost and Found in Armenia.  It's bit SNL at first, with a bit of foreign non-Hollywood non-polish.  It's coarse.  It's immersion in a different world.  It's taking the bus instead of a plane.

The plot is light, and it's good old-fashioned melodrama a la The Russians Are Coming.  In fact, combine that with Doc Hollywood and you get a sort-of sideways sense of the plot.  But I don't like reviews that actually drag you through the plot.  So I won't.

The movie can be enjoyed on the surface because, even though it's sometimes painfully and sometimes happily low budget, the cinematography is artistic and ""sets"" are unique.  The plot has some predictability and some twists, but an engaging progression.  There are: gentle slapstick, melodrama, and for those who like eye candy, a uniquely gorgeous heroin - again - exotic beauty, not glamour. But all are presented with kind and gentle hands.

If you want to go a bit deeper, then there are layers of personalities and motivation - a la Russians Are Coming, and portraying how we can become caricatures of ourselves when we are our own motivation.  No one lectures or anything; it's just there if you want to think about it.  And, if you want to go even deeper, you can - but again it's simple - there are messages that aren't touched on much, but they are touched upon: about war, fear, and what can make people become their own motivation.

It was neat to see the credits and, if the names are true, realize that this wasn't simply an outsider's portrayal of Armenia. I appreciate those people, for allowing a simple and sweet melodrama gently introduce me to a small corner of Armenia in a semi-light-hearted way, and who also put their talent on the line by presenting their simple home-made meal on my cable box menu alongside of sometimes rich but indigestible haute cuisine of Hollywood.

I look forward to watching it again.",1373673600,9,1894,4.693939393939394
5751818,5,B00CYI4KCA,"Hysterically funny! I'm ashamed to say I needed to watch a bootlegged version online as they never showed it in the UAE, but I've made amends by ordering 5 copies",1372982400,8,162,4.433333333333334
5751819,3,B00CYI4KCA,It was a quirky movie.  I was attracted to it because of my Armenian heritage.  Not my kind of humor.,1429142400,,101,4.0
5751820,5,B00CYI4KCA,This guy is a good actor needs more movies to make lol I'm just going to the greats part it is when he is flying,1424476800,,112,3.52

5751824,5,B00CYI4KCA,"I loved this movie!  I have watched it 3 times and gave it to my brother-in-law on his birthday, he loved it too!
this is a must see if you like foreign film tough much of it is in English.  Fun, fun, fun!",1409184000,,205,3.744186046511628
5751825,5,B00CYI4KCA,Video was brand new and works great.  Love this movie esp of you are Armo and understand the language.  Thank you,1403740800,,113,4.333333333333333
5751826,4,B00CYI4KCA,"Really fun movie to watch.
I didn't give it a full 5 stars because they could have the ending a little more dramatic,
Having said that My wife and I both loved it from the start.
At times we laughed so hard that tears were forming.
As a matter of fact, we enjoyed just as much the second time around.

It's a movie worth ordering.
BTW there was an Adam Levine lookalike (with a beard).",1400630400,,385,4.133333333333334
5751827,5,B00CYI4KCA,"This movie may not be for everyone, but for those willing to explore and experiment, it's a surprisingly enjoyable comedy that most all ages can enjoy, provided, of course, one can read subtitles. Much of the movie is spoken in Armenian, and for Armenians out there, the stereotypes of the characters, story subplots, etc. will resonate. Hence, it may be funnier for Armenians, than non Armenians. All in all, I would recommend this as a fairly innocent, pleasant experience, one the entire family can enjoy.",1393891200,3,508,4.988235294117647
5751828,5,B00CYI4KCA,"If you liked Uncle Tanoose in ""Make Room for Daddy,"" with Danny Thomas, then you will love a whole village of them in this movie.  Jamie Kennedy is perfect in illustrating how funny and confusing languages can be!  You do not have to be Armenian to find the humor in this movie.  I recommend it!",1392508800,5,295,4.327272727272727
8587516,4,B00CYI4KCA,"Great film but you have to want to read a lot of subtitles to enjoy this film. Terrific premise which works well, especially if you know the situation in that area of the Middle East.",1502668800,,183,4.257142857142857
8587517,3,B00CYI4KCA,"I am 25% Hay and 75% Odar LOL and my wonderful Grandpa Armen passed when I was only 16. He taught me many words in Armenian, but over time I've lost a lot of them. Many of the older Hay actors in the movie remind me so much of him, but I really need American or British subs to help me understand the Armenian spoken in this movie please, because it's such a cute movie by all accounts. I love my heritage, even if it's mixed. I would love to understand every moment and word of this story.",1499558400,,490,4.010204081632653
8587518,5,B00CYI4KCA,Nicely done and well acted. It has high production value. Most of the acting is good. Some are clearly amateurs. But overall a nice comedy.,1492214400,,139,4.6
8587519,5,B00CYI4KCA,This movie is hilarious!,1476230400,,24,5.25
8587520,5,B00CYI4KCA,imaginative and funny.  My Armenian family cracked up even after seeing it three times.,1465776000,,87,5.214285714285714
8587521,3,B00CYI4KCA,"Let's set the record straight - this a bad movie and it's full of one-sided propaganda. And I absolutely love how bad it is. The plot is ludicrous, the production values are mediocre at best, and the fact that they allude to but rarely (if ever) show the cultural historic sights and the city of Yerevan is a huge missed opportunity to promote the beauty of the country. As funny as it can be at times (and I don't believe much of it was intentional), I have to say the entire time I was thinking... why did Jamie Kennedy do this movie? What possible path down the decision tree led him to this? You kind of feel bad for him, but in a very friendly way. Also, I'm pretty sure the main Armenian actress was also in Lost, so that's a plus. Overall, it's not a movie non-Armenians would like unless you're a fan of the comically absurd. Every Armenian should watch it though, and will enjoy it if they have a sense of humor and a bit of perspective.",1452038400,,946,4.261111111111111
8587522,3,B00CYI4KCA,"The movie is actually pretty funny - if you know Armenian. It's decidedly less funny if you have to rely on the awful subtitles. It's not that humor doesn't translate well; I watched the Russian-dubbed version of the movie, and it's every bit as funny as the original. It's just that the person or people responsible for the subtitles simply did a horrible job.  Some lines are grossly mistranslated, while at other times they decided to paraphrase or embellish what's actually said, turning something that's funny into something that's not.
By and large, the Armenian crew does a good job, although some of the acting is a bit over the top, even for a slapstick comedy such as this. Jamie Kennedy's acting, on the other hand, is just abysmal. He gives a wooden, uninspired performance; more importantly, he's just not funny.  I would've given the movie at least four stars if he weren't in it.
On a technical note: the subtitles during scenes in a language other than English (the vast majority of the movie) cannot be turned off.  So, even if you do understand Armenian, you still have to go through the torture of looking at those awful subtitles. Also, the DVD is copy protected. That means you can't rip it or create an ISO file of it (without special software) to watch the movie on a device without an optical drive, such as a tablet or an ultrabook.",1449446400,2,1357,4.645833333333333
8587523,4,B00CYI4KCA,"It is very funny , but you should know eastern  Armenian to enjoy it more. The actors and the young actress were the spice .I enjoyed it fully. It is worth  having the DVD. .",1443657600,,174,3.942857142857143
8587524,2,B00CYI4KCA,thank you,1431043200,,9,4.0
8587525,5,B00CYI4KCA,"One of the best movies I have every seen, a must see for anyone that is looking for a comedy mixed with a slight history lesson, and a beautiful character development. Thank you for the laughter and the tears, looking forward for part 2 maybe?! :)",1430870400,,247,4.391304347826087
