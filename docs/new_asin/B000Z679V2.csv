8234771,2,B000Z679V2,"Dard Divorce (Olaf Ittenbach, 2007)

I don't know why I keep submitting myself to Olaf Ittenbach's movies. To be fair, he's nowhere near as awful a director as Uwe Boll, but let's face it, Ittenbach hasn't had an original thought in his life, at least as it pertains to film, and it's not as if he brings anything fresh to the table in his retreads. And yet I keep watching these silly things. In fact, this is my second Ittenbach movie in two weeks. And, scarily, I liked the other one better.

Dard Divorce is the story of Nathalie Stein (Ittenbach's wife Martina--who, when not appearing in Ittenbach movies, makes uncredited appearances in Uwe Boll movies), who's in the process, as you might be able to surmise from the title, of going through a nasty divorce from her husband Tim (Barrett Jones, appearing in his second Ittenbach joint). One night, after Martina receives a threatening letter containing only the word ""DARD"" (which, as it turns out, is Persian for ""pain""), Tim, who's supposed to be bringing the kids home, shows up dying and tells Marthina, ""they have the kids."" She runs upstairs to call the cops. When she gets back down to the porch, the body is gone, along with any trace of her husband's death. The cop in charge of the case (Kamary Phillips) is obviously skeptical, but you know something bad's going to happen. After all, it's an Olaf Ittenbach movie.

And the worst thing that happens in it is the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad sound mixing. There are extended sequences where the background music and the vocal track were obviously supposed to be mixed the other way round. (You can hear the voices, it's just really, really difficult.) The special effects sounds are straight off public-domain special effects CDs. The music ranges from distracting to outright ludicrous. You know, that sort of thing.

On the other hand, as with all of Ittenbach's movies, if you've come to the table with an appetite for outlandishly over-the-top special effects of the gore variety, Dard Divorce delivers perhaps better than any of Ittenbach's earlier offerings. The blood doesn't look nearly as fake in this one as it has in earlier releases (including the superior Chain Reaction), though the bloodletting in this movie is of the ""if you brush your teeth the wrong way, blood will spray"" school of special effects. But then, the whole point here is to spray blood, so are we surprised? Of course not. As well, Martina Ittenbach, while not the most solid actress on the planet (and, again, not as good here as she was in Chain Reaction), is certainly easy on the eyes. Many people have commented on her thick German accent, though I had no problems with understanding it.

While Dard Divorce, aside from struggling with perhaps the dumbest name I've seen all year in a movie (though Zombie Nosh is still in the running), has often been called Ittenbach's entry in the torture porn genre, there is at least something of a story here, and it plays out more as a gore-soaked mystery than a straight horror film. It's not entirely awful, which I guess is more than I expected. **",1233964800,2,3104,4.7407407407407405
