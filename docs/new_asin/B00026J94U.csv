8022726,3,B00026J94U,"Since I was a teen, back in the 90s, I've been a big time Tourniquet fan. My main hobby is collecting Christian Metal and archiving music. This was releases in 1994 which was an odd time for them, along with other metal bands of their day. The music scene was changing and the word ""metal"" was becoming less and less fashionable. This band previously hailed for their technically proficient neoclassical slanted speed/thrash, went into a more cutback groove laden mid paced style. They also got a new vocalist, that was not the shrill shrieker like Guy Ritter. Usually that tends to really alter a bands sound. It's only about 45 minutes of the bands behind the scenes, live clips, and a concept video that is not much different from many an old rock bands home video release.",1370304000,,776,4.671532846715328
