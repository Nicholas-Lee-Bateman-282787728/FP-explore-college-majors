1646086,4,B00005QARV,"My uncle bought this movie for me for christmas when I was 7. Even though I'm 29 now, I still watch it. I've taken really good care of the tape. Granted it is inaccurate as far as certain details is concerned, but thats only what they knew back then when the film was made. Other than that it's still a good movie. I just wish they would restore it and put it on DVD.",1356220800,,367,3.972972972972973
1646087,5,B00005QARV,"I first watched this movie when I was 5, and I have loved it ever since!  It shows its age, but that doesn't bother me as the movie shows 4 boys going 1/2 a billion years back in time.  If JoJo had never noticed the cave, the adventure would never have started, and they boys would never have seen the Ceratasaurus versus the stegosaurus.  If you love good sci-fi films, you would definitely enjoy this movie.  In my opinion, this is the best sci-fi movie of all time!  (Peyton, age 11)",1349481600,,486,4.2967032967032965
1646088,3,B00005QARV,"i like the adventure travel from nyc to ""was it imagination past land w/ the creatures in it"", where the best thing in it was the storm & the ""dinos"". not a well known show but cool even though a 'lil strange one.",1344902400,,213,3.9767441860465116
1646089,4,B00005QARV,"This VHS title is showings its age  - however it was one I was never able to shake from my memory banks in over 40 years - it was shown in New Zealand around 1963/64.
The animation is not what you might have expected and some of the acting is a little light - to say nothing of an new piece tacked on the beginning to set the story in America.
None of these are real complaints - I'm enjoying watching this film again - and I'm glad I bought it.",1278115200,,445,3.89010989010989
1646090,4,B00005QARV,"I remember so clearly watching this show many times on the ""Garfield Goose"" show in Chicago in the early 1960's. ALways wondered if I would ever see it again, and like others have mentioned it doesn't have quite the impact seeing it as an adult, but I was amazed by it back then. Thanks for bringing back a piece of my childhood. It was a very well done series for it's time.",1272067200,8,375,4.222222222222222
1646091,4,B00005QARV,"Like most boomer males I saw this one in the early 60s and loved it. Of course it has aged (like we have) and nothing like this is as great when your 50 as when your 10, but it brings back some fond old memories that allow you to escape to a simpler and in many ways a better time than now, if only for an hour or so. For that its well worth owning and watching.",1148860800,10,362,3.7142857142857144
1646092,5,B00005QARV,"I first saw this film as a child in the very early 1960's on the Don Dominix Cartoon Theatre Hour, which aired weekdays on Channel 10 WTHI-TV Terre Haute, IN. It was broken down into approx. 15 minute segements, each segement being aired weekly. I have been searching for it the past several years.

  As a small child, the film brings back many memories. At the time (early 60's), it seemed to have a magical quality about it. Although that magic is gone now that I am an adult, it was still fun to see the film again.",1144281600,3,519,4.275510204081633
1646093,2,B00005QARV,"Sure, I watched this on an old black & white television set when I was a kid, and I had memories of how ""good"" it was.  I should have left those fond memories well enough alone. What impressed me at age 7 doesn't quite cut it at age 49. About half-way into the film last night, I started to say to myself outloud, ""This is really bad!"" I watched it all the way through, only to think, ""my memory of it was better than the reality of it.""  It didn't help that I was ""wise after the fact"" about some details of the movie: it's a Czech film sandwiched inbetween American bits. The four kids at the beginning of the movie are like so many Raymond Burr's edited into Godzilla, or Bela Lugosi's edited into Plan 9 from Outer Space. They're not the same kids in the huge middle section of the movie (which is why you're not allowed to see their faces clearly except in the middle section -- otherwise, they're all deliberately faced away from the camera). English is dubbed into the Czech kids' mouths with poor synchronization. That dubbing made the gawky stop-motion photography seem good by comparison.

What was missing was the original sense of mystery and awe -- primarily because it was impossible to suspend disbelief.  Other joys of my youth seem to have survived my maturity into adulthood unscathed, but this movie didn't.  Some items from my youth I'd be happy to share with my children. This one, I'd be embarrassed to have them sit through. I'll check it out again when I turn 79 -- maybe I'll be far enough gone mentally that I'll be able to suspend disbelief again and re-enter this film's awe and mystery, which are now quite inaccessible to my rational self.",1133740800,3,1669,4.4950495049504955
1646094,4,B00005QARV,"After having seen this movie dozens of times on television I can finally add it to my collection.  Back in 1960 an attempt was made to make an accurate dinosaur film.  One where the animals behaved as paleontologists believed,  Journey was that movie.
Four young boys visit the American Museum of Natural History.  They visit the dinosaur exhibit (of course) as well as the rest of the museum.  In an exhibit of Native Alaskans, a shaman figure seems to be giving the boys the evil eye.  The boys then rent a rowboat in central park.  Here they row into a mysterious cave that leads to an even more mysterious river.  As the boys travel along the river they also travel back through time.  The further along the river, the further back in time until they reach the primordial ocean.  All through the journey one of the boys keeps a journal of their adventures.
Throughout the movie there are explanations of the dinosaurs, prehistoric mammals, ages of the Earth and plenty of other educational information.  The film ends with the boys staring out over the ocean and thinking about the volcanos forming continents on the other side and the eventual formation of the Earth.  Suddenly the boys find themselves waking up in the museum by the Native Alaskan exhibit under the gaze of the Shaman.  What a strange dream.  But the journal...
This movie was intended to be entertaining and educational.  Paleontologists made sure that the facts stood firm against the teachings of science making this possibly the most accurate science fiction movie of all time.  Even though much of what we know about dinosaurs has changed since the movie was made, it still hold its charm.",1088035200,25,1667,4.776223776223776
1646095,5,B00005QARV,"I saw this film when I was maybe six, and ever since then, I have loved it. It is definitely a great movie, well worth the price. Take my advice: buy right now!",1079049600,3,160,3.878787878787879
1646106,5,B00005QARV,"The greatest dinosaur fantasy of the early 60s. Animation that rivals Ray Harryhausen formatted in a childhood dream that was a hit decades ago. Amazingly, it holds up wonderfully today. It is unfortunate that it has not been released in DVD. this may be that Red Flag for Animation Collectors to get ""em before they are gone.",1437177600,,326,4.7368421052631575

1646108,4,B00005QARV,"I bought this out of shear nostalgia sake. I saw this on a kid's show in Chicago, in episode form when
I was in grade school. I liked the story and its a simple presentation of Earth's prehistory. It's aimed toward
a young audience but it is dated. That being said, it is still worth a look for kids ages 7-12. I only wish it was in the episode form",1430265600,,349,4.0

1646111,5,B00005QARV,Loved this tape as a kid -- my brother and I watched it on loop back then. A great film. I hope it doesn't fade into more obscurity than it already has.,1419724800,,152,3.78125
1646112,5,B00005QARV,One good story that catches the imagination and takes you on a journey into the past where you feel you are the participants rather than the one's just watching the movie+,1407110400,,171,4.548387096774194
1646113,4,B00005QARV,"Quality of this extant print varies a lot, including the color.  The sound is dubbed, and is out of sync during the dead Stegosaurus examination sequence.  Stop motion, cartoon animation, puppetry and live action are all used for the wildlife.  The four boys have close encounters with different animals, and it conveys a general idea of the passage of time and the development of life.  The very beginning of the universe is still given as a biblical viewpoint.",1382054400,,462,4.884615384615385

1646115,3,B00005QARV,"I think some of the reviewers here are expecting 'way 'way too much from a children's educational film made almost 60 years ago. This film was imported to the States from Czechoslovakia, where the original title was ""Cesta do praveku."" Some new footage was added and the film was edited to make it more accessible for American kids, and the film was distributed in an episodic, serial format to be shown on children's television shows. My younger brother and I were latch key kids, and we used to watch each episode in the morning before we went to school. I recently watched this film again on the ""Crackle"" channel after almost fifty years, and it was a pleasant walk down Nostalgia Lane. The stop motion animation was quite impressive given the limits of the film's budget, although sadly the serialized American version was printed on inferior film stock and the visual quality is poor. Even so, ""Journey to the Beginning of Time"" captured the imaginations of untold numbers of children throughout the Anglosphere and taught us something about prehistory.  Judging from the IMDB reviews, I'd say the original film provided fond memories for many continental Europeans as well. So, c'mon, guys! Let up! The film is now something of a nostalgic curiosity and not suitable to contemporary audiences of children, but both the film and the filmmakers deserve some respect.",1364169600,2,1371,4.960869565217391

7949963,1,B00005QARV,"I bought this DVD with the understanding that I would be getting Journey to the Beginning of Time. I got the case, the DVD said the title of the movie without issue, but when I went to put it in, my computer AND DVD player said that this movie was called The Oldest Profession. When I played the movie, it wasn't the movie I wanted, but it was something else! I want my money back!",1518825600,,381,4.093333333333334
7949964,5,B00005QARV,"I had been waiting ever since 1968, when this movie was first shown here in the US to see it! I missed seeing as a kid back then, but a friend found it on DVD for sale, & I was able to order it! Talk about making up for lost time! Just recently watched it, & it brought back all the memories from the trailer commercials for it back in 1968! For its time ( it was actually made back originally in the 1950's, but not released here in the Us until 1968), it is a fun & exciting young kids movie, about mysteriously going back in time & seeing various prehistoric dinosaurs & mammals! Good fun! It has never been put on TV back then, or now, so it was unfinished business of finally seeing it!",1515628800,,691,4.0510948905109485

7949966,5,B00005QARV,"I remembered this as child and it inspired a life-long interest all things prehistoric. This is the Czech language version with subtitles, but the plot is so simple it's heartwarming. If you watched this (in episodes) as a child and what a nostalgic boost, I highly recommend it.",1502755200,2,279,4.833333333333333
7949967,5,B00005QARV,"Like many an aging American, I was first exposed to this movie in 1960 when it was shown in 6-minute chapters on an afternoon kids show, dubbed with East-coast accents, with an Americanized wrap-around framing device showing our four lads (but not actually their faces) visiting New York's Natural History Museum and being hypnotized by a wooden Indian oarsman.  It was much fun, and some years ago I bought a VHS tape of this version.  Now I have the great pleasure of owning the original 1955 movie in Czech, with English subtitles available.  The transfer, color, and sound are much better than before, with some footage I've not seen until now.  Director Karel Zeman was a true movie magician.  The trick mattes and creature effects are amazing for their time, and behind the Iron Curtain, too.  Not only are these wonders convincing, but they are displayed with great accuracy, taste, and even poetry.  Kudos also to a sensitive and haunting music score by E. F. Burian and Frantisek Strangmuller.  There is adventure and excitement, but the prehistoric animals behave in a believable manner and the action never gets monster hokey.  We have seen much advancement in special effects since then, but this film still holds up wonderfully as a dream-like fantasy that dare I say also is very educational.  I recommend it strongly for family viewing that should satisfy everyone.",1485043200,7,1380,4.960869565217391
7949968,4,B00005QARV,"I saw this as a kid back in the early 1960's, where it was presented as a serial of many short ""episodes - only around 10 minutes each as I recall,  as part of a one hour childrens show on Saturday mornings.  Many years passed;  I forgot all about it ---except at odd times when it would come to mind and I would say,  ""what ever happened to that show??""  Well,  now while searching for other stuf on Amazon,  the magic of the almost limitless resources of the 'Net worked its spell and up it popped while searching for stuff on a  related topic!  At first I wasn't sure this was the same show despite the title,  as I never knew who the producer was and just assumed it was American because it appeared on American TV.

After watching it, though,  it definitely is the one I was looking for;  but because this is the original movie and not the episodic version,  it doesn't ""flow"" quite the way I remember.  I have a (now vague) memory of an English soundtrack too,  which may have been dubbed in the episodic version.  Also it certainly feels ""dated"",watching it now 50+ years later... but nevertheless it brought back some early memories and I enjoyed seeing something again that I thought was lost forever.

7949970,4,B00005QARV,"I ordered this movie hoping that it was same one I saw in a movie theater when I was a child. Unfortunately, it was not. The movie, with English subtitles, was enjoyable. Probably not for those who are into all the contemporary CGI films, but those with a nostalgic streak for the old films of the 1950's & early 1960's should give it a shot.",1470614400,3,342,4.276923076923077
