Story:  guy and girl meet at some kind of parolee program, girls mom gets sick so they get back into the street game to get money, and they turn into bonnie and clyde. they rob and kill about 100 people and get away with it. girl gets pregnant and they leave the game.  They are working for a man named Fats who is introduced to us raping a man who wronged him some kind of way.  that was a funny scene.  they leave the game and go back to their regular jobs. fats comes back and gets revenge because the guy left his organization.  the guy comes back and gets revenge on fats and the movie ends.  there was a good twist in the end.  i liked the twist. otherwise i'm mad i spent my money on this.",1294012800,,887,4.140350877192983

7935528,3,B00005AQ4Y,"Fans of Redman, the Lost Boyz and other such artists will probably like ""Statistic"" more than me.
The Statistic's poor direction made it difficult to follow what was going on. However, I got used to after it after a while.
The image quality however was top notch. Very few DVDs look this good.
The director's comments (not included on the VHS to my knowledge) were not very good. They brought no additional enjoyment to the movie.
Overall, this DVD was just OK.",995932800,,461,4.634146341463414
