That seems to be the message in this better-than-average TV film based on a notorious 2003 case in which an American woman died on her honeymoon while scuba diving off the coast of Australia. Her husband, a dive rescuer, told authorities he had been unable to save her.

Amber Clayton is excellent as Tina, who at first resists the overtures of Gabe (played chillingly by Billy Miller), when they both are students at the University of Alabama at Birmington. Later, there are signs of mistrust when Tina catches Gabe flirting at a party, and, subsequently, when he postpones giving her an engagement ring that he has bought and placed on top of a dresser. Tina doesn't seem to focus much on Gabe's request that she name him as beneficiary on her life insurance before the dive trip.

Generally, this movie seems to portray Tina as suffering from a lack of assertiveness. She's never been fond of water, and at one point, jokes that she appreciates breathing air -- a tragic foreshadowing of the crisis that eventually leads to her death. However, Gabe insists he wants a wife who can share some of his favorite water-based pursuits. The film poignantly depicts Tina savoring land-lubbing activities Down Under -- feeding kangaroos, cuddling a koala -- and wishing they could last.

We also observe Tina in a close relationship with her father, Tommy Thomas, who is played out-of-type but convincingly by the masterful Harvey Keitel. Tommy seems skeptical of Gabe from the start, and a power struggle of enormous proportions starts to build from their first encounter, when Gabe says he's a church-goer but won't tell Tommy where he worships.

There is a fairly complicated storyline here that jumps back and forth between locations and time periods, and sometimes it's a little challenging to keep straight. However, the acting is so strong that that's a minor quibble.",1497312000,,1953,4.942073170731708
