8532727,5,B001ESNH4S,"I coach the Miscoe Hill Skippers, a demo team for the American Heart Association and other affiliations, and a competitive team. The dvd has helped bumped up our skill level in double dutch.  Love the way it was made and how they walk you through the skills!  The best instructional dvd I have purchased! We put the dvd on focus on a particular skill and then the kids go off to work on it!  It is a GREAT teaching tool!",1372291200,,420,4.225
