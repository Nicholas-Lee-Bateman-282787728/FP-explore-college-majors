6356282,3,B00JEZWRH6,The first 3 1/2 years were the best of the Virginian after that my opinion they gradually got worse but they are still good to watch,1467590400,,132,4.115384615384615

6356284,5,B00JEZWRH6,"The Virginian is probably the best western series that has been on television.  The majority of the stories are of good taste and  have a moral to them. Also, the action is first class, weather it is the programs regulars or visiting actors. I have seen the complete series and they all are excellent.",1464048000,2,301,4.555555555555555

6356299,2,B00JEZWRH6,"I liked the last season 8 I think but I never loved it it was a long boring 90 minutes with Commercials which made it hard to follow and seemed like forever till the end.  I did see one review that said the first 3 seasons were the best and that was to me obvious that person really must be on something;  I will say the show got better later with some good cast changes and not worse!  I have never been a fan of character actor Lee J. Cobb we all have our own taste and I have seen many of his old movies and I just did not like anything about him so there is no way I would tune into his episodes of this show.  I also read an interesting review of some episodes I think from season 7 with David Hartman saying he seemed more like a bank clerk than a cowboy and I totally agree, He was awful and completely miscast, I do not watch those episodes either.",1473465600,,856,3.930635838150289
