4593314,5,B00571A7DC,"What a privilege to have access to this collection of great teachers and mystics! I am grateful that films like this are being made.

This film contains portions of interviews with several teachers and mystics from a wide variety of spiritual traditions. I appreciate the tone of the film as it does not try to conclude a `correct' vision, but rather allows these teachers speak for themselves. The viewer is, then, left to draw his or her own conclusions (or simply enjoy!).

By the end of the film, I was moved to tears. For me, it is deeply inspiring to consider the good that can come through a spirit of openness, inquiry, and humility. We have already seen that not much good comes when religions and cultures simply fight to convey superiority and dominance; hasn't the history of human civilization demonstrated this? How might things change if more of us listen to one another - learn from one another - with a spirit of curiosity and compassion?!

My only disappointment was that it ended when it did. I found myself drawn in and wanting more! I understand that the full interviews may be released at a later time for those who share my sentiment. For now, only so much can fit in one film.

I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in mysticism, religious studies, compartive religion, or simply hopes for peace among divergent world views.",1259798400,5,1360,4.725738396624473
4593315,5,B00571A7DC,"With One Voice goes beyond rhetoric to the heart of, I believe, all religions. This film is not a ""how to,"" but a brilliant reflection of what is meant by true nature, awakening, and joy -- all described by current leaders, mystics and spiritual teachers from many different traditions who have experienced this level (or way) of ""being."" Skillfully directed and with a beautiful musical score, this documentary will personally touch those who see it and create a forum for discussion among those with different beliefs. I hope ""With One Voice"" is seen by many. I have purchased it as a gift for others because of its powerful message.",1259712000,3,635,4.834862385321101

Matthew Flickstein has done a remarkable job and should be commended.",1259712000,3,303,4.846153846153846
4593317,5,B00571A7DC,"""With One Voice"" is a film with an important message for our times. Mystics -- people who've come to realize the deepest truth of their spiritual/religious traditions (including Buddhist, Christian, Hebrew, Hindu, Moslem, Native American, Shamanistic and non-sectarian practices) -- speak from their direct experience about the peace that is available to each of us. This is a peace that is found within, not imposed or negotiated externally. These mystics speak about their own personal experiences of realizing this peace and that all of these traditions ultimately lead to the same truth.

The film contains beautiful images and music interspersed with the comments of the mystics. It's very well done and easy to watch.",1259712000,4,723,5.342105263157895
4593318,5,B00571A7DC,"A was so pleased to hear that there was finally going to be a release of a film that put aside all of the finger pointing and the judgments about who has the best religion, and instead got right down the the important issues and the reasons why the various religions began in the first place, which is for each one of us to awaken to our true nature. You can't purchase enlightenment but but I feel like I put myself in good company by purchasing this DVD. The interviews are with real people from all areas of spirituality, Native American Shamanism, Christianity, Buddhism, and many more. Interviewed for this documentary are people that have gone beyond the typical mind states and into the area were all is peaceful and love prevails. ""At last"" A film that cuts to the chase. It took someone who knows a bit about this to capture this on film, Mathew Flickstein has done just that by producing a film  that documents the awakening of the people interviewed. With One Voice is a green film, one that will be remembered for as long as there are people on this earth. With One Voice has come out at a time when people most need it, it points to the truth, that spiritual awakening is possible.",1259712000,16,1194,4.4520547945205475
4593319,5,B00571A7DC,"This remarkable documentary features prominent scholars and mystics of many different religious and spiritual traditions who speak ""With One Voice"" in agreeing that we're all interconnected with and dependent upon one another and our world.  They also agree that love, compassion, and the peace that surpasses understanding are the natural fruits of this realization, regardless of one's specific faith tradition. ""With One Voice"" is a refreshing and reassuring antidote to today's media messages that focus on religious doctrinal differences, intolerance, and radicalism.

4593322,2,B00571A7DC,"This is one of those familiar documentaries that intersperses Peter Coyote narrative over a round-robin series of interviews with charismatic spiritual leaders with dazzling eyes and sincere smiles as they discuss unity, love and becoming our true selves in peace and brotherhood.

It's great stuff and it's true stuff - the singular experience of pure mysticism knows no doctrinal boundaries or conventionalized mediation through words and priests.  But in the end, the talk becomes sales speak for the cult of personality.

One ""mystic"" has a row of books he presumably wrote behind him as he intones on love and transcendence.  You can't quite make out the titles but you sure as hell can see the designs on the covers.

Another interviewee has had a lot of plastic surgery done to her face and dresses in the finest organic cotton linen.  It's all very tired and superficial and...I apologize for this... Californian.

Not all those interviewed are in this category.  But, in the end, this film probably poisons an individual's sincere path to transcendence.  The cult-like gurus with feet of clay create separation between themselves and the seekers (who probably pay hundreds of dollars to attend weekend seminars high in the mountains or on beachside resorts to hear and see firsthand the enlightened ones).

We should simply fire all the flashy gurus and listen to the guidance of the quiet inner voice.  And once we find truth and unity, we won't even want to yap too much about it.",1459036800,12,1491,4.971774193548387

4593356,5,B00571A7DC,"Clearly the most important documentary on religion every produced.  I know this is a strong statement but this documentary gets to the essence of all religion and shows that the essence that crosses all true religions is the same.

I was expecting a high level, ""outside in"" documentary...""this religion believes this, this religion believes that"", but when I started watching I knew immediately that this documentary would be much more.  ""With One Voice"" immediately started by talking about mystics....essentially approaching all religions from the ""inside out"".  When you go to the heart of all religions (the inside) and strip away all the external beliefs, the ceremonies, the vestments, the trappings, you are dealing with the essence of religion...the essence of life.  The mystics, each in their own way, within their own religion, or outside of any organized religion, eventually strip away all the external and all end up in the same place...realization, or God, or whatever you want to call It. And once they get there, they see it all the same, no matter what religious background they came from.  There was a quote in the film, ""once you get to the mystical, you go past the differences"".

This is a powerful documentary, a documentary that you would like everyone in the world to see...it's that important...it has the potential of promoting understand between religions, even countries, but then, how many would really understand?",1411603200,3,1445,5.14957264957265

4593368,4,B00571A7DC,"Read any single review and you already know this DVD compiles interviews with some 21 mystics from a variety of religious traditions, including at least three Christian as well as Jewish, Tao, Buddhist, Hindu, Sufi, and one African shaman.  Each of them is asked several questions, and the film compiles excerpts from their answers to questions like: What is the mystic experience?  How does it relate to organized religion?  How do the world's great religions relate to each other, if at all?  How can we bring about peace in the world?  How does one live a spiritual life?  What is love?  What is God?
While this movie is unlikely in my opinion to convince a skeptic about the existence of a Creator or Higher Power, it may convince some religious people that the essence of the religious experience in each of these traditions is really the same message.
As with anything else in life, I personally resonate more strongly with certain speakers than I do with others, though all of them have much the same answers in different wording.  I particularly enjoyed listening to one Hindu speaker, a couple of the Christian mystics and the African ""shaman"".  Others will have their own personal favorites.  But this is a good reminder of many things: that a spiritual life is not about going to church one hour per week, or even meditating 2 hours a day, but rather a constant ""mindfulness"" of whether our thoughts, words and actions are a positive or a negative influence on those around us (and ourselves); that the founders of each great religious tradition all had some powerful experience of the oneness of mankind; of the oneness of humanity with all of the rest of creation, and of a single Source at the root of everything.  Then gradually over centuries, the followers become entrapped by dogma and ritual, and lose sight of the original message.  That peace is something that must begin within individuals, before it manifests in the world at large.  That we all influence each others, in ways we aren't even aware of much of the time.  I haven't yet sampled the audio CD which I think is to be conducive to meditation.  Would it also be conducive to falling asleep?  I don't know, but the message of this documentary is a very good one indeed.",1407024000,7,2250,4.716112531969309

The ""one voice"" is the common thread of understanding about love and oneness present in every religion, every spiritual understanding.  These wise and compassionate teachers have cleared the fog of dogma and rest on understanding, peace, and acceptance.

4593398,5,B00571A7DC,"This is an extraordinary film.  How could so many people from so many different spiritual traditions speak ""with one voice""?  The answer on one level is that they do not.  Each mystic provides insights and analogies distinctive to his or her own life and tradition.  Shieka Fariha al Jerrahi cites the Qur'an and Joseph Goldstein references the Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation.  The two dozen or so spiritual masters have diverse backgrounds: from Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism through Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and on to the native traditions of America and Africa.  Some of the mystics, notably Wayne Liquorman, whose words and sparkling presence add immeasurably to the film, are not products of any particular religious heritage.  The film reflects at length as to why there are so many different religions, but makes no attempt to conflate them into a single, generalized faith.  Marcelle Martin, a Quaker, contends that no one tradition can tell the whole story and Zen master John Daido Loori emphasizes that each religion has an integrity of its own.  Swami Karunananda says that each person has a responsibility to go deeply into his or her own spiritual discipline.  Thus, the film does not dilute spirituality into a common, but tasteless and meaningless, spiritual soup.

 Yet remarkably, in with and under this radiant multiplicity, ""one voice"" nevertheless emerges.  The spiritual teachers again and again point to a transforming awareness, an understanding, as Father Thomas Keating, for example, would have it, that is nonconceptual, direct, intuitive, unmediated by reason or reflection, and is, in fact, contrary to what had previously been believed.  Rabbi David Cooper suggests that there is a ""universal fragrance"" that can be experienced, but which the trappings of language obscure.  To come to this realization is to be utterly changed, yet simultaneously to become fully who you were all along.

 Most happily, the film's center is neither on visible diversity nor on an abstract theory of spiritual awakening.  The heart of the film lies in the journey to transformation available to each of us.  The paths to awakening are not for the great mystics alone, but for all.  That at bottom is the reason for the film.  Toward that end the film glistens with insights for the spiritual seeker.  Bhante Gunaratana emphasizes that the most effective way to peace is to work with one person at a time.  Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev stresses that the quality of ""I do not know"" is essential.  Brother David Steindl-Rast focuses on the need to become less fearful.  Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche says that spiritual practice must be central to one's entire day.

 Peter Coyote provides narration at the beginning and end of each section of the film.  These words bring unity and clarity to the film, focus attention on the key dimensions of spiritual practice, and point to the possibility that this ""one voice"" might be raised in each of our lives.  Lying behind these words and undergirding the length and breadth of the film is the work of Matthew Flickstein.  He interviewed these spiritual teachers and it was his energy, understanding, and guiding vision which made it possible for this remarkable film to be made.

 One caveat.  These spiritual teachers are not necessarily scholars.  Consequently, some of their interpretations of religious traditions may not stand up to scholarly scrutiny.  For example, some speakers present an idealized portrait of the founders of the world's major religious traditions.  Also, the focus on love as a universal characteristic, as emphasized by some of these teachers, is probably not consistent with the history of individual traditions.  These are, however, minor quibbles.  They do not reflect negatively on the film, but rather illustrate the pitfalls that await a mystic when he or she speaks historically rather than experientially.  The film itself is superb.",1262736000,48,3928,5.174603174603175
4593399,5,B00571A7DC,"This is both a beautiful and moving work that looks deeply into the core of many spiritual traditions from a mystical perspective.  It explores and affirms the validity of these different paths, but most importantly, it illuminates the common heart of these beliefs.

For those without a spiritual practice, it may help you consider that there may be meaningful ways of being and knowing beyond the concepts and experiences that derive from your normal senses. It provides a foundation for understanding the deep and sometimes subtle awareness that there is something beyond the way we often experience our lives.

For those with a spiritual path, it may help you become aware of the mystical dimension of your faith, providing motivation to develop that un-mediated spiritual experience you may have been missing, further deepening your practice.

This work helps to take us beyond the reflexive separation that often accompanies awareness of our obvious differences, moving us toward deeper recognition of our oneness.",1260748800,18,1020,5.316770186335404
4593400,5,B00571A7DC,"I was able to order this title from the publisher a few weeks ago, and when I watched it I realized it was one of those works that can have a profound influence on how you see your life and world. I have always had an interest in religious and spiritual teachings and practices and have tried to be open to and get exposure to diverse traditions (although my primary study has been the teachings of Buddha and Christianity). This DVD places different traditions side by side and highlights the connections between them in common spiritual messages and experiences. Regardless of tradition all spiritual paths seem to come back to a common point:unity, peace, and compassion. Many of the teachers, especially one who represented Zen, emphasized that they are not advocating one ""faith"" or ""religion"", that many paths are needed for the various peoples and temperments of the world. It was so enlightening to hear people from such varied backgrounds coming to such similar insights and conclusions, which should remind us all we are more alike than different even if apparent differences are what we as people usually notice. I highly recommend this item to anyone wanting to expand their spiritual path",1260748800,11,1201,4.9504950495049505

The reviews have captured the essence of the film--the freedom that exists within all of us. These diverse voices all share the same message--that there is a moment when you know that you cannot go back to not knowing, a point where you become aware that we are all one.

4593403,5,B00571A7DC,"'With One Voice' first describes 'Enlightenment', the direct experience of unity with God, Divine Reality, or the Absolute, and how it happened to each of the interviewed spiritual masters from many different traditions.

'With One Voice' also shows that there are many paths/religions to this direct experience of God, Divine Reality, or the Absolute. However, viewed from the perspective of the spiritual masters from those many paths, the essential nature is shown to be the same for all religions (With One Voice).  Part of the surprise here, for me anyway, is the revelation of mystical (direct experience) traditions in religions not normally thought of as 'meditative' - i.e. Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.

The film shows that when the true essence of all religions is shown to be the same, the divisiveness between the religions may fall away and religious tolerance can prevail.  The film goes on to show that through this religious tolerance, and through people recognizing their true peaceful nature by following a mystical/experiential path, peace in our own lives and peace in the world can become the norm.",1260144000,2,1124,5.227777777777778
4593404,5,B00571A7DC,"With One Voice is a beautifully crafted documentary with teachers from many spiritual traditions coming together to share their insights and experiences.  It gives one a peek into the different ways that lead ultimately to the same goal.  Beyond the wise words and first-hand descriptions of the deepest states from these religious leaders, the film captures visuals and sounds from each tradition that enable a deeper understanding and appreciation of each path.
An important part of the film explores how true spirituality can be an antidote to the various forms of fundamentalism that seem to be sweeping the world.

4593407,5,B00571A7DC,"Flickstein's dedication to this documentary shows through in every moment.  I was privileged to view it with a commentary from someone involved in its production who explained how he approached this ""backwards"".  The traditional approach is to storyboard your documentary and then conduct interviews, guiding your interviewees to the points that you want.  Matt went out with a limited set of questions for each interview (conducting 30 in all) and then edited the documentary together afterward.  This was significant to me because the conclusion was unscripted but yet so clear - there is but one truth, whatever you call it.

Mystics have struggled through the centuries to describe the indescribable - these folks come pretty close.",1259798400,7,736,5.310344827586207

8460140,5,B00571A7DC,"What I got from this film, which I happen to agree with wholeheartedly:
The kingdom of God is within you.
Bringing the calm and peace you find within yourself to the external world can only reduce fear and suffering in others.
A daily spiritual practice is what keeps you in spirit.  I agree but we all can't meditate 6 hours a day.
But taking moments throughout your day to center yourself and stay true to yourself is possible.
These are excellent takeaways for me.  So are:
Sending a love poem to someone you are in conflict with.
Being sincere and honest with yourself is good too.
Love is the key and appreciation of others is essential.
This film is a great reminder of what to do to help oneself and others... be the light and the inspiration to others ...peace will come to the world one person at a time.
I have homework to do to live up to these ideals.
Also..talking about what spirituality is minimizes it by putting into words that which is beyond words or thought.
Religion tends to be divisive whereas spirituality and love are what we are here for.",1521936000,4,1064,4.479381443298969
