7776514,2,B01H49VL8Y,"The Heathcliff cartoon is Must See Television?  Yeah, okay.  Normally I'm tempted to buy classic junk food complete sets like this, but Mill Creek's recent cardboard packaging (as pictured) is terrible... if I pre-order from amazon (or any online vendor), it will arrive creased or dented.  So I have to be ""lucky"" enough to happen upon a crisp, shelf-worthy copy in stores, then keep my fingers crossed the clerk will handle it lightly when I cash out.  That's a long shot.  Mill Creek, please retire this package design ASAP.",1466208000,5,527,4.876404494382022

This set has the flimsiest box construction/materials EVER. You will think this is a bootleg. The manufactures of this DVD should be embarrassed to have released such a substandard product. What do you expect for $10? MORE THAN THIS! Just charge us an extra dollar and beef up the box, baby!

The quality is a little poor on the episodes, but I think all of our eyes have gotten use to viewing HD content that when we go back and view non-hd content we tend to notice. Plus the master tapes they used to transfer the series to digital probably had some wear and tear. With all that said the its still very watchable and will take you back.

The quality of the video is pretty good, I think. I'm always concerned about mill creek DVD sets because of how many episodes they cram into one disc, but it looks fine to me.

Like others have said, the packaging is utter garbage, but that's the trade off when the set is so affordable. I may end up just making my own box.",1501027200,,435,4.166666666666667

7776535,1,B01H49VL8Y,Ohhhh man when i saw this for the asking price i almost broke the purchase button. For the longest time i have been trying to figure out who and what heathcliff is about growing up and where i could watch the movie they released on disney eons ago. Come to find out that movie was a compilation of like 3-4 episodes from the series. Was happy at first then the bad came along the color schemes in the show change alot which is not a big deal but after watching the first 5 episodes the next couple get so bright its very hard to watch. Anybody with decent eye sight should have an issue and I hate how nobody on the review section mentioned that. not going to ruin my eye sight for that. Like I said the episodes fluctuate so not every episode is like that but whats the point of watching if ur gonna miss a bunch due to quality. Shame they couldn't re touch some of the episodes. Great show none less I love heath cliff I hope they can re release these in better quality on a blu ray I will dish out the wallet,1485648000,3,1011,4.085427135678392
7776536,4,B01H49VL8Y,"Back in 1980, Heathcliff was in a TV series by Ruby-Spears called Heathcliff and Dingbat, which is on DVD by the Warner Archive today! In 1984, Heathcliff went over to DiC, alias Cookie Jar Entertainment, and became an all-new series, running 86 shows in all (plus a feature-length movie that somehow ain't in this set!), and all in this 9-disc DVD set by Mill Creek Entertainment! With the lackluster packaging this had, it's a good thing I thought to get some normal-sized 6-disc DVD cases; 1 of those can easily hold all 9 discs, with 3 sleeves, without bulging a lot! Disc 1 also has a bonus episode from a lesser-known 1980's series called The Get Along Gang; its own series set is also sold by Mill Creek, as a single disc DVD! Don't ask me how Mill Creek gives us more bang for our bucks like that, or with unusual packaging of sets like Heathcliff's! Heathcliff predated Garfield by 2 years in the animation biz, unless you count Garfield's very early short from 1980 seen in Happy Birthday Garfield from 1988! When Garfield got his own show in 1988, he once said ""Hey Heathcliff, eat your heart out!"", obviously stealing Heathcliff's thunder by the end of Garfield & Friends in 1994! Like the 1980 series, Heathcliff was voiced by Mel Blanc himself, also for the DiC series, and he sure ain't the same Heathcliff as the one he voiced in the one-shot Looney Tunes short Dough-Ray-Meow from the WB! Too bad most of Garfield's 2D work ain't on DVD anymore, but you have the next best thing with this 9-disc DVD set, and also the Ruby-Spears series from the Warner Archive! With 86 shows, you never know what he'll get into trouble for next in this set!",1485388800,,1658,4.567114093959732
7776537,5,B01H49VL8Y,"As a child of the 80s, Heathcliff and the Catillac Cats stands out as a personal favorite. All 86 episodes of he 1984-1986 series here, spread out over nine discs. The only things missing are the bumpers and extras included on the Shout! Factory releases and Heathcliff the Movie. The picture on the DVD is very clear, especially compared to my memories of a grainy, weak signaled UHF station that broadcasted the show in my youth. Mel Blanc is just as talented as ever, providing the voice for Heathcliff and the stories still hold up pretty well. The episodes are three segments with the first being dedicated to a Heathcliff adventure (often with a visiting from the three goofballs of the Catillac Cats), the second segment is dedicated to the Catillac Cats (no visit from Heathcliff though), and the final is a PSA/educational short with Heathcliff giving us a lesson.

Bottom line, it is a good price for a bit of nostalgia and if you enjoyed Heatcliff as a child and are tempted to buy this collection, go for it!",1484352000,,1020,4.666666666666667
7776538,4,B01H49VL8Y,Great cartoon.  I'm glad we finally got the whole series.  This is just like the the previous Mill Creek releases.  Same stuff and they just changed the image on the front discs.  No remastering and no digital make over. The packaging was horrible.  I bought some 5 prong DVD cases from Amazon and put the DVDs into them.  Then I used the previous release paper sleeves and put them on.  I did the same thing with Dennis The Menace.  I also do this with most of Mill Creeks releases.,1484092800,3,483,4.348314606741573

7776540,4,B01H49VL8Y,"How can I say this? There is a reason this 9 disc set of Heathcliff The complete series by Mill Creek Entertainment is under 15 bucks - there's no case.

by the looks of it, it looks like a box set, right? well, it's really just 5 cardboard sleeves (4-double sided) stuffed into a box. i would have gladly paid a little more for this set to have it in an actual case.

Also, there are no captions or subtitles. Probably another reason why it's so inexpensive.

Overall, I'd still say it's a great set. I mean you are getting all 86 episodes for under 15 bucks here. I suggest getting a nice CD wallet and putting the discs in that. That's what I'll be doing",1481846400,17,657,4.198412698412699

7776547,4,B01H49VL8Y,Due to the packaging I would like to give this a lower rating but with all the nostalgia I can't.

This video show a comparison spine by spine of this DVD and a standard DVD. Also shows spine by spine comparison of this DVD and that Shout Factory release one.
How ever I do recommend buying this show.",1470528000,2,394,4.197368421052632
7776559,4,B01H49VL8Y,"I was a child of the 80's, so I grew up watching this show.  It is still GREAT.  I purchased this for my son and he is enjoying it. The resolution for the Heathcliff episodes is actually pretty good.  The Catillac cat episodes are a bit fuzzy though, but not too bad.  One thing that is really cool is on the first disc, prior to the show starting, there are previews for old shows.  Example: The Getalong Gang.  What a wave of nostalgia!  My only complaint is the box set this comes in is terrible quality.  It is super thin, flimsy, and the bottom part fits awkwardly into the top part. It sticks out, like it's supposed to, but they just seem to fit way too loosely together.  It is not a thicker box like normal box sets...it's not even as thick as a standard dvd sleeve.",1470268800,7,775,4.217687074829932
7776560,4,B01H49VL8Y,"The wait is long over! For the first time on DVD all 86 episodes of the 2 season run of Heathcliff are on DVD! Time to get rid of those compilation and volume releases because this is the only set of Heathcliff you need (although purists may also want to get the Shout! Factory release for the episodes containing bumpers and extras). Picture quality looks A-OK especially since discs 1-6 have 11 episodes per disc (possibly minor compression but nothing severe) not surprising since those discs are basically the same (and now OOP) Season 1 volume releases with different disc art. Disc 7-9 are new containing all of season 2 with 7 episodes per disc (so compression should be just fine there). Unfortunately, no Heathcliff: The Movie in case you're wondering (not sure if that's owned by DHX or if MGM has it due to being a Clubhouse Picture film, a Atlantic Entertainment Group division who's library was bought by MGM via pre-1996 portion of the PolyGram library).

Now, a word of warning; like the Season 1 Volume 1 release, the Cattilac Cats episode Young Cat With a Horn still has that weird cut resulting in the episode abruptly cutting to another scene which is odd since Mill Creek made a replacement disc with the episode correctly uncut. Luckily, like before, all you got to do is e-mail Mill Creek regarding the matter and they'll give you a free replacement.

So if you love Heathcliff (and Mel Blanc), buy this set today!",1470182400,28,1436,4.694444444444445
7776561,3,B01H49VL8Y,"This is definitely a 5 star series and one you'd want for your collection if you are a fan of classic 80s cartoons.  But in receiving my pre-order today the packaging is extremely poor.  Normally I don't give packaging too much mind but this is one of the worst I've ever seen.  No plastic at all.  The entire thing is made out of cardboard and cheaply so.  The slip cover doesn't even cover the entire box that holds the DVD.  The box consists of flimsy cardboard sleeves that the stuff 2 discs into very tight making it easier to scratch them.  Now I know some are saying it's such a cheap price what do you expect.  Well for $17.00 they could have had at least a plastic outer shell.  Even the ones that just have the big square hole on the inside that they put discs in sleeves in.  Personally I'm going to transfer the discs to a multi-disc case to keep them better protected.  But we really shouldn't have to do that.  The series itself is definitely well worth owning, but the cheaping out on the packaging was just glaringly obvious on this set.",1470096000,4,1053,4.343589743589743
7776562,4,B01H49VL8Y,"You can't really complain about much since you get the whole series for such a low price.  The picture quality is on par with the TV broadcasts.  It is definitely worth owning if you like this series.
Things that you might want to know:  Oddly, on the first disc, quite a few episodes stretch out to 16x9, so if you don't want to see the characters looking a little fat, you'll have to manually set your TV to 4x3.  All of the discs are in tall cardboard slip covers stacked inside the box with a piece of filler cardboard.  Episode 40 on Disc 4 ""Catfood For Thought/Going South"" (which is mislabeled on the DVD label as ""The Carnival Curse/Going South"") contains the ORIGINAL season one theme (only at the beginning of the episode, not at the end).  The rest of the episodes have the second season theme (just like when the show is rerun on TV).
Obviously, since this just came out on the day of this review, I haven't watched all of the episodes in the set all of the way through.  There could be other things of interest in this set that I haven't found yet.  I actually like the Cats & Company/Cadillac Cats segments the best.
Unless you are a super picky videophile, if you like this series, you should buy this set.",1470096000,5,1221,4.371681415929204
7776563,5,B01H49VL8Y,Heathcliff is 50 times better then Garfield and is way more funny as well over Garfield.  I guarantee you 10-1 peoeple enjoy Heathcliff more then Garfield since Heathcliff's characteristics are far more rounded and can be related to human's more then Garfield can. That is why I give Heathcliff cartoons 50/10 since Ilove them so much and it always makes me laugh so hard from the jokes and humour.  Too bad I can't say the same thing about Garfield.,1469923200,,450,4.6835443037974684
7776564,4,B01H49VL8Y,"Mel Blanc is amusing as the giggly, tough, and verbose comic strip cat, reprising his ABC network Ruby-Spears Heathcliff role from 1980 to 1982 for this DIC Enterprises syndicated 1984-1986 run.

The Catillac Cats in the supporting segment in the series were an appealing group with short boss Riff Raff, blonde leg-warmer wearing Cleo, necktie wearing wise guy cat Hector, skating rhyme master Wordsworth, and goofy Mongo.  Stanley Jones, who played the voice of evil Lex Luthor in the ""Super Friends"" show, played two good guys roles as Riff Raff and Wordsworth.

Writers for this DIC  Heathcliff series included Ann Elder who was part of the 1960s-1970s ""Laugh-In"" ensemble,  and Chuck Lorre who later created the tv series ""Two and A Half Men"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"".  Infamous ""Ren & Stimpy"" creator John Kricfalusi worked as an animation director for this series, although it is probably doubtful that this program ranks high on Kricfalusi's personal favorite achievements list.

Not as raucous or slapstick-filled as the ABC Ruby-Spears Heathcliff series but a pleasant and memorable mid 80s flashback.",1469404800,5,1112,5.213483146067416
