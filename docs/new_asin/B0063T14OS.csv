8492214,3,B0063T14OS,"This had so many good reviews in England that I was sure I was gonna love it. It tells the story of Liza and Sally Kat Redstone and Sophie Anderson), they have been together for a while and are even in a band together. They have best mates with Jamie and Vin (the latter is a cheap rent boy). They are at a stage in their relationship where love has become obsession and the passion that once drove everything has begun to suck the oxygen out of their lives. In short they are heading for a break up.

This is fuelled by what the cover calls a `hedonistic' lifestyle. If getting off your head and listening to faux post punk music is hedonistic, then I would agree. At one stage Liza says ""there is a whole other world of people that go to bed at night and get up in the morning"" just to emphasise how `hedonistic' they are really being. The music they listen to and play is a constant through out and is heavily influenced by all girl band `The Raincoats', who are actually played on vinyl at one point, and the likes of `Wire' and even `The Fall'.

As the relationship heads for the dumpster of love with an inexorable pull, the drug usage, toilet usage and swearing are ramped up. All of that is fine and believable, which is the major strengths of this film - it is very honest. Where it does fall down is in the pacing, at 102 minutes I felt that this could have been improved by being a bit shorter, at one point I was thinking I do not need a lingering shot of nigh on a minute of someone looking upset, to realise that she is actually upset - we get it already.

Also there is only one bedroom scene and that too is a bit on the tame side, but is used to drive the narrative. There are some very touching moments and some good performances. This has been written, directed and produced by Kanchi Wichmann and is a first effort. For all that praise is indeed due, but that could have led to the slowness of pace in places, some outside objectivity might have helped. Still there are not enough gay let alone lesbian films, so I wish the whole team the very best with the next outing, but for me this was just Ok, hence the three stars, quite nearly four for the urban street shots of London and some good camera work.",1322438400,3,2224,4.215962441314554
