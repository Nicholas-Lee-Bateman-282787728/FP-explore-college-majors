8169926,5,B000MLQ5Y2,This movie is great!!! I got it as a gift for my husband. He use to watch it when he was little. It's in it's original format. English dialogue! Was so glad I could find this for him! He was very happy. Only thing is it looks like the cover looks printed out and possibly the cover on the disc was homemade as well. It still works great and everything. I just found it a little odd... I don't know if its suppose to look that way or not.,1359072000,,437,3.9213483146067416
