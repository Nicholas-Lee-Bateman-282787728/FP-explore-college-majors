7975487,3,B00007ELK6,"A senior prom is being held in a castle. At midnight everyone disappears except for a hand full of students who must fend off a psychopathic serial killer (Kim Coates) and a shape shifting demon (J.H. Wyman). The students must face their own fears to survive. Wymen provided us with a demon with personality, capitalizing on the success of the ""Freddy"" franchise.

The film was okay. It is dated to the 90's and has lost its cool appeal. Now available on an 8 film mutti-pack.

7975488,4,B00007ELK6,"The Club is a movie that I really enjoyed as a teenager. I rented it at my local video store and have thought back fondly on it ever since. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but there was an original concept here that made this movie memorable and fun. I also thought the acting was great for this type of film, especially from Zack Ward. I have held onto my VHS copy of this movie for years, desperately waiting on a DVD release. Well, I recently did find it on a ""8 Movies Horror Movie Collection"" in the $5 bin of a department store. It was one of the movies on this collection. I was so happy that I wanted to cheer right there in the store. I would love to review that disc here on Amazon, but it doesn't appear to be available here yet. If you are a fan of this movie, just know that there is a DVD out there that you might get lucky enough to track down for $5 (with seven other films as a bonus).",1373241600,5,918,3.9408602150537635
