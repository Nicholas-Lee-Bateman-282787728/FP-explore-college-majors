8653788,5,B00JSWS9C2,"I recommend this DVD to any serious Karateka who would like to add to their training/review collection. Kyoshi Vellucci's kata are sharp and well presented. I've known Kyoshi Vellucci since 1993 and have always admired his crisp kata and kobudo performances. He has aged a bit since our Atsugi (Ebina), Japan days, but that was expected. :) Nice Job Kyoshi!
