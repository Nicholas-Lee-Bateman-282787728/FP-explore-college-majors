7828597,4,6302643945,I ordered this tape for my kindergarten class because I loved it as a child. They really enjoy watching it and are quoting the movie. My only gripe is its a different vhs than what I had growing up. The big apple city part is the same but the additional cartoons at the end is totally different than what I grew up watching. All in all I absolutely loved watching it with the kids and I even remembered the dialog verbatum. Its a must have for those with children.,1243728000,,464,4.224719101123595
