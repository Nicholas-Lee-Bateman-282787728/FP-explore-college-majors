8197938,5,B000QXCP5E,"Modern day Turks are reading a re-written version of their history.  When governmental forces and individuals are courageous enough to look at the past to acknowledge the lies and sins perpetrated upon their current population then truth will prevail.  At present, modern day Turks are eating the fruits of their own lies - which will could cause them to decay from the inside out (morally and spiritually).  The Ottomans conquered much of the Christian world (including Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, etc.) and treated non-Muslims as second class citizens (all this is documented in history) at best and as lesser than animals at worst. When one takes the time to examine the historical evidence, it is plain to see that as people we do not treat each other very well.  The Turks could learn from the example of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa.  Imagine a Turkey in which non-ethnic Turks and non-Muslims were embraced instead of persecuted.  That would be a case for personal and corporate transformation from the inside out!",1221177600,8,1063,5.080459770114943
8197939,5,B000QXCP5E,"Alas, only a Turk (or a Turkish-funded student/scholar, or simply a someone who for some personal reason, wants to deny history) would dis the content and premise of this DVD. And only they would try to spin the genocide from what it was to a ""tragedy.""

Revisionists, what are you so afraid of? The whole world knows about Turkey's bloody past.",1211414400,3,345,4.655737704918033
8197940,1,B000QXCP5E,"Yet another program that portrays the tragic massacre of Armenians as a ""genocide"", while ignoring the equally tragic massacre of Turks, Kurds and Azeris....by Armenians!

 Armenian nationalist groups were in revolt against the Ottoman Empire from the 1890s, attacking and killing innocent Muslim civilians. This violence escalated until Armenian soldiers and gangs were killing tens of thousands of Azeris, Turks and Kurds from 1917 to 1920.

 When will Western media, politicians and educators begin to tell both sides of this tragic story? They believe all too readily the Armenian Diaspora's version of events, yet ignore what Turks and Ottoman scholars have to say about the Armenian Revolt and the tragedies it created for all sides in the conflict.",1202169600,3,755,5.372881355932203
