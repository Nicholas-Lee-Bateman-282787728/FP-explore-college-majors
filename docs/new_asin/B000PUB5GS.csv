8193372,5,B000PUB5GS,"Maria Felix plays the role of a ruined aristocrat (Diana de Arellano)  that has enthralled a wealthy man (Julio Villareal), willing to marry her and shower her with diamonds, knowing fully well that his passion is the mad last caprice that he can satisfy as an elderly, sick man. In the meantime a young man who loved her commits suicide when he finds out her impending marriage, and it is this early death in the opening scenes that marks the ambiance for the whole film.
Maria looks splendid in the beautiful gowns she always wears with her habitual panache, her expressions are very telling of her character, which is always deceptive, we never know for sure who really, if any, of these men has a hold of her feelings. She quickly manages to seduce the nephew of her future husband, who is a much younger and attractive man played by Luis Aldas, he is actually more like a son to his uncle, since he was the one that raised him and paid for his studies in the US. This betrayal is too painful for him, which will account for the tragic development of the story.
The atmosphere is perfect in projecting the darkness of the script in all the scenes, Diana's beautiful art-deco interiors, the grand office of her husband-to be, the cabaret, and particularly the excellent scene of the park at night.
This is the best film noir I have seen with Maria Felix as the star, her presence and stunning natural beauty make her perfect for the role as the deceiving and conniving seductress.",1281830400,2,1483,4.575187969924812
8193373,3,B000PUB5GS,"The plot of the film might be a little simple, and the movie itself is simple, but is actually Maria Felix the one who keeps you on your seat till the very end. Her beauty is truly shocking and I am sure (for what I saw) that she was better than most of hollywood stars and as better as the greatest stars (Taylor, Hepburn, Davis, Hayworth). I don`t think even Marlene Dietrich would have moved her eyebrowns is such suggestive and powerful way as Miss Felix have done.
The very final close up is the one of her dead body, and, indeed she was the prettiest corpse I have ever seen!",1248048000,,581,4.243243243243243
