6679756,3,B00NT9647C,"still haven't completed watching the whole series yet, just wanted to post that for those out there who want to own this anime its been announced that Discotek is releasing an official North American dvd set in november of 2014, heres the link: http://www.fandompost.com/2014/05/22/discotek-media-sets-tentative-devilman-complete-anime-dvd-release/ & http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-07-16/discotek-adds-devilman-tv-cardcaptor-sakura-film-jin-roh-dallos. Now as for this bootleg dvd set, picture is great but theres  quick instances that were pixalated here and there, the  english subtitles seem ""off"" sometimes too but for the most part I understand what's going on, I honestly haven't yet finished the first disc though I plan on updating this review once I finish the series but I recommend waiting for the official Discotek dvd set.",1408060800,,846,6.477876106194691
8680072,5,B00NT9647C,"They gave me the wrong item... instead of getting ""Devilman The Complete TV Series"" I got an HDMI cable... I can already tell this is going to be a great purchase though, Devilman is a great series and I'm excited to watch it (when I finally get this HDMI cable returned and the actual product shipped back). So I'm not going to rate it poorly just because I received the wrong item, that would be disingenuous of the actual product.",1524528000,,433,4.425

8680078,5,B00NT9647C,"For an anime that was air in 1972, i must the animation is fast paced and it was ahead of it time.  The devilman in the anime is more of a ultraman than satan.  Each monsters or demons are like monster of the week style like ultraman.  I love the show and all, i do recommend it for hard-core otaku's.",1490572800,,301,3.9833333333333334

8680080,5,B00NT9647C,"As far as the earlier Japanese anime from the 70's, so far this one is my favorite by a long shot. The story lines are not complex, but each episode is entertaining, as a new ""Monster of the Day"", or ""Demon of the Day"" appears. The concept of a demon possessing a human being and then being subdued by the human emotion of love, to become a demonic superhero who fights his fellow demons is rather ingenious, especially at this early date. Up until now my only exposure to Devilman was the Manga USA reboot from the 90's - which was pretty good, but only a couple episodes. If I remember correctly, there were some Devilman comics released in the US by Danzig's comic company (could be wrong). This is certainly a violent cartoon, as people die in each episode - I have only watched about 10 episodes, but am highly entertained and amused so far. There is one episode that shows Devilman whipping a female demons breast - that shocked me! I have heard the series caused something of a backlash because of the violence and I can understand why. Remember, these 70's Japanese toons cannot really be compared to modern anime standards. Rather one should look at the toons being released in America at the time. The Japanese have always put quality into their animation and have taken the format much farther than any western creators have done since recent decades (a few exceptions come to my mind such as Thundarr the Barbarian from 1981). Who is it? It is Devilman!",1474329600,8,1465,4.574144486692015
8680081,5,B00NT9647C,"Loved it. As an anime fan this is up there with other  classics.such as getter robo,mazankizer,grandizer and votes v. If you're a true old  school  anime fan this is a definite must  have.pure classic.",1456876800,3,201,4.823529411764706
