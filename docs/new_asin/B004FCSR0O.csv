8427759,2,B004FCSR0O,"I saw a promo for this on TV and thought it would make a great gift for my father-in-law. We bought it directly from the production company (not Amazon) and it took forever to ship. We finally got it and gave it to him for Christmas. What a disappointment. Are there a few scenes where you'll chuckle? Yes. Is it ""the most hilarious huntin' video ever""? Not by any stretch. This doesn't even come up to the shoelaces of a B-grade movie. This is little more than a low budget home video, very choppy and poorly done. If this is what the comedic careers of these men (Mel Tillis, Tom Lester and Tim Conway) have been reduced to, I'm sorry to see it. They deserve better, and so do you.",1388448000,,683,4.2615384615384615
