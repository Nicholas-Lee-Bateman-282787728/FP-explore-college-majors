3596105,3,B001G5T6NU,"""The Avenging Conscience"" could be early silent cinema's first standout film.  Though credited elsewhere as containing many different motifs from Poe stories, it is primarily ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" which it derives its source material from.  It was released in 1914 by Mutual Studios, with the legendary D.W. Griffith directing, producing, and scripting the feature.  Henry B. Walthall (who later went on to work in many horror-themed productions, including the lost ""London After Midnight"" with Lon Chaney) stars as a frustrated young man whose overbearing uncle keeps him away from his lover.  As he considers murdering the uncle, he is tortured by horrific visions, and after watching various insects devouring each other, goes through with his evil plans.  Griffith uses all the tricks in his bag in this film - double exposures and special effects that portray the madness that Walthall may - or may not - be sinking into.  Watch this film and see if it ends the way Poe's great story did!!!",1227571200,,995,5.07361963190184
8303961,4,B001G5T6NU,"The film references some of Edgar Allan Poe's ""Annabelle Lee,"" and ""The Tell Tale Heart,"" but really has its own melodramatic silent era tropes. A young man, raised by his uncle, becomes his dutiful ""employee,"" but rebels when the uncle jealousy forbids him to pursue his choice of a girl. Well, he does anyway, and the tensions heat up, until finally the young man  kills his uncle, something we were endlessly waiting for to happen given the referencing of ""The Tell Tale Heart."" and the film's mostly slow pace. But are some really great fast cutting close ups of a clock ticking, while the police inspector taps a pencil, cut to the nervous hero, cut to the inspector tapping his foot---that really builds the tension! Another worthy part is the dead uncle's ghost reenacting the crime. But I can say no more about an avenging conscience due to the movie's ending. Weak spots: limited sets, most of the rest of the photography, and the poorly developed escape-to-the-barn sequence. If you can forget about expecting Poe's story to be followed --nobody's going to dismember a body and bury it under the floor-- then you can still enjoy this movie.",1454976000,,1150,4.808080808080808
8303962,4,B001G5T6NU,"An interesting look into mans needs and desires, and how desperate one man can get, It has a surprising twist in the end. It also reflects the morals of the silent era, which is sadly lacking today.",1435968000,,198,4.378378378378378

The worst part of this generically-packaged disc is the blackened rectangle in the right lower corner-probably blocking the TCM logo attached  when this film aired on cable.  (Try to NOT stare at that block when watching the film!!) Complementing that feature is the shrunken viewing area--black borders surround the entire screen..The icing on this disappointing presentation is the lack of musical accompaniment--it is truly silent.! The only feature that is acceptable is the print quality.  Other than that, this is a disc to avoid!",1361664000,,558,5.306818181818182
8303966,4,B001G5T6NU,"A must for lovers of silent films, this pre-Birth Of A Nation and pre-Intolerance work by D. W. Griffith is unexpectedly sophisticated for its time, and offers a preview of his gifts for cinematic storytelling that were so distinctive in his later masterpieces. Griffith here has adpated Poe's The Telltale Heart, with a liberal dose of Annabel Lee (and even a hint of The Cask Of Amontillado) added in for good measure. A young man is in love with a young woman, but his uncle/guardian does not approve. Since the man is too poor to go off on his own, he decides to kill the uncle in order to claim his inheritance. However, as expected, the conscience of the title does him in. For the most part, the actors forego the usual melodramatics that were common for the silents, and the results are surprisingly effective. The only drawbacks are an over-the-top religious sequence not found in Poe's original, SPOILER ALERT and the ""it-was-only-a-dream"" finale leading to a happy ending, which, nevertheless, may have seemed quite original to the 1914 audiences (today's viewers, of course, should not judge this film by contemporary standards of sophistication and technique - Griffith et al. were the pioneers).",1342396800,3,1209,4.960591133004926
8303967,2,B001G5T6NU,"and actually pretty boring in places. Some scenes go on way too long, and others are short and choppy. Sometimes you wonder what a particular scene is doing in the film at all (exotic dancers, bunnies????). Seems to always be a wind blowing across the sets, as drapes and papers are moving, the bird cage is constantly twirling. Falls far short of its billing as ""The First Great American Horror Film."" Very disappointed in this one; does a disservice to Poe. If you want to see early psychological terror, check out the German Expressionism films of the early 1920s.",1239062400,2,567,4.737373737373737
8303968,5,B001G5T6NU,"After years of squinting through poor-quality copies, our friends at Kino have released Griffith's 1914 film ""The Avenging Conscience"" on dvd. This means we have an excellent print to view and enjoy. Thanks Kino.",1231804800,6,212,5.264705882352941
8303969,5,B001G5T6NU,"This is one of those films that seem to get better each time you watch it and discover more layers and facets of this rather macabre, psychological thriller.  It also reveals another facet of D.W. Griffith who wrote and directed this unusual drama just one year before he directed the landmark ""Birth of a Nation"" in 1915, and many varied epic and historic films to follow.  Besides his interest in history and people's struggles generally, which many of his best known films reflect, he obviously also had a penchant for Edgar Allan Poe, combining poetry and prose with the mental anguish and emotional horror which characterized Poe's work.  Griffith managed to balance the dark elements of the story with good and beautiful things, not in the least the triumph of the good in man over the evil when the main character in this story succumbs to his guilty conscience and repents.  But all is not as it seems when the story first unfolds to show a bitter old man resent and attempt to destroy his nephew's romance with the excuse that marriage would ruin the business and career plans for his nephew and only heir.  Filled with anger and resentment, the nephew starts to wish for his uncle's death, and so begins his long and twisted course down to the depths of utter despair and misery.  The strong emotions expressed by all three main characters are disturbingly palpable in many scenes so that the viewer is swept away with the young couple's agonizing plight while in anxious suspense of what the final outcome will be.  Although some of the special effects scenes are very basic, the momentum and intriguing plot keep the viewer's attention focused on the emotional issues rather than occasional poor camera work.  This has the effect that the climax and final twist will be an unexpected surprise, and in the end bring the whole story into harmony and balance.  Another feature of Griffith's directing which is prominent in ""The Avenging Conscience"" is the use of close-ups of babies, cute puppies and other pets, as well as some poetic lines from Poe to give emphasis to deeper emotions.  Sometimes criticized for his rough and fast editing, this film nevertheless shows that Griffith was a master of the film-making art in the way he put together this complex film with characters which seem to scream out at the viewer.  These are the aspects one comes to appreciate more deeply after several viewings, and for these reasons I've upgraded the rating from four to five stars.  It is also an important film in the Griffith repertoire which has been neglected, and a newly-composed piano score for this new release does the film justice.  The picture quality is near perfect and a pleasure to watch, and for those familiar with Griffith's early films, his regular stock actors are also to be seen, namely Mae Marsh and Robert Harron as a young romantic couple who remind the grumpy uncle of young love, while Blanche Sweet is perfect as the nephew's love interest.  A moving and unforgettable Griffith short from 1909 called ""Edgar Allan Poe"" is also included, as well as some notes about the film and music to complete this exciting DVD release which is part of Kino Video's new Griffith set putting the spotlight on his less-known but equally worthy films.",1229904000,2,3266,4.808928571428571
8303970,5,B001G5T6NU,"Commonly regarded as the first true masterpiece of the genre, The Avenging Conscience emerged from the cinematic vaults back in 1914.
D.W. Griffith directed two other superb silent films--Birth of a Nation and Intolerance--both of which made AFI's top 100 movies of all time.  They contain startling images that will leave a lasting impression.
The Avenging Conscience is no less spectacular.  The story is inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart.  A young man is driven to madness after committing murder.
What's most amazing with this movie is the camera work.  Ghosts floating through the room.  Heavenly images superimposed in the clouds.  Demons gathering in hell.  There is a high level of surrealism and metaphors that make this film truly special.  It all culminates into one creepy, ground-breaking piece of horror cinema.  Highly recommended to silent film buffs.",1228435200,2,883,5.294964028776978
