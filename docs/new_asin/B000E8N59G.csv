I would recommend it to anyone interested in working in metal clay, no matter what type they use.",1352332800,,259,4.3061224489795915
8348701,5,B000E8N59G,"I found this DVD to be very informative. For beginners, there are quite a few techniques that are demonstrated and talked about in depth. I have been working with PMC for 5 years and I still came away with some great tips. Celie Fago and Tim McCreight work very well together and are excellent teachers.",1247097600,4,303,4.527272727272727
8348702,2,B000E8N59G,"I have been looking for a good video product about PMC to share with my glass class and am very disappointed by this DVD. The production values are pretty poor and overall it is just a decent effort for amateurs. It is not something that I can run in a class. Oh! well, the search continues.",1228521600,,291,4.214285714285714
