8748615,4,B01AVMS8U0,"Warning SPOILERS!!! This is a good action/mystery film, known for its pulse-pounding car chase (by Rmy Julienne and his team of precision stunt drivers; he was also second unit director) which, in my opinion, has yet to be beaten. It also stars many familiar Canadian actors, most of them still alive (at the time of this review).
  The film opens with Dr. George Tracer (Martin Landau; WITHOUT WARNING - 1979) having a heated conversation with Louise Saitta (Carole Laure; NAKED MASSACRE - 1976) on the grounds of a college campus in Montreal, but we don't hear what they are arguing about. She then calls her brother, Tony Saitta (Stuart Whitman; GUYANA: CRIME OF THE CENTURY - 1979), a Captain on the Ottawa Police Force, but he is too busy breaking up a bank robbery to take the call. A short time later, Dr. Tracer is called to the college to treat a female student who has overdosed. That student is Louise and, when he discovers she is faking it to make him look like a fool, he gets very upset because a bunch of students at a party laugh at him, including his son Robert (Jean LeClerc; THE UNCANNY - 1977). It is obvious that Dr. Tracer and Louise are lovers and when she drops dead at the party of an apparent overdose, Tony comes to Montreal with partner Sgt. Ned Matthews (John Saxon; CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE - 1980) to investigate her death.
  Tony meets a cadre of potential suspects, all who attended Louise's funeral. Julie Foster (Tisa Farrow; ANTHROPOPHAGUS - 1980), a blind student at the college who was Louise's best friend, tells Tony that his sister was very troubled the last few weeks of her life, but she doesn't know why. Tony searches Louise's apartment and finds some photos that pique his interest. Tony believes his sister was murdered, so he has a talk with her ex-boyfriend, Fred (Dave Nichols), who tells him about and argument he saw between Louise and Dr. Tracer. When the autopsy results come back and Tony discovers that his sister was poisoned, he confronts Dr. Tracer, who tells Tony he did not murder Louise and he can prove that he gave her a stimulant during her fake overdose, as those pills are still in his medical bag. He retrieves the bag and opens it, but the pills are not there. Dr. Tracer begs Tony to ask Margie Cohn (Gayle Hunnicutt; LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE - 1973), as she saw him giving Louise the pills at the party. Sgt. Matthews did background checks at everyone at Louise's funeral and tells Tony that Margie is known to sleep around. Sure enough,  when Tony goes to question Margie, he finds her sleeping with Robert. She backs up Dr. Tracer's claim about the pills, but she will not swear to it in a court of law.
  Meanwhile, we watch some unknown killer murdering a woman by bashing her head in over and over with a metal pipe and dumping her body at a construction site. It turns out the victim wasn't a woman at all, but rather a transvestite who happened to be Margie's brother. Tony and Sgt. Matthews go to arrest Dr. Tracer, but he has his lawyer waiting for them at his house. That doesn't deter Tony, who slaps the cuffs on the doctor and brings him to the station. Sgt. Mathews does an extensive background check on Dr. Tracer and finds a photo of Louise wearing a necklace that is familiar to Tony, but he can't place it...yet. After learning about Margie's brother's death, Tony searches for some transvestites that can clue him in on what the brother was up to before his death. He finds two of them, one who beats the snot out of Tony, sending him through a balcony window. Tony finally gets the upper hand, sending the trannie through the other balcony window and shoving a hot curling iron up the ass of the other trannie (!). One of the trannies has a key to a locker at a bus station and when Tony goes to open it, he is attacked by two men, who turn out to be detectives who were surveilling the locker. When Tony opens the locker, he finds the necklace. Julie tells Tony that his sister gave her a necklace a day before she died. Tony then talks to a dwarf stoolie at a racetrack and chases a suspect into a crowded public bathroom, where he does what all good detectives do: kick-in a stall door (interrupting a priest taking a crap!) and shoving the suspect's head into a sink full of water when he refuses to talk (at least it was a toilet bowl!). This leads to the car chase I talked about at the beginning of the review.
  Tony lays waste to the streets of Montreal while chasing a crater-faced suspect (Jerome Thibergien; RABID - 1977), as they play bumper cars with innocent drivers, destroy fire hydrants, empty boxes and other things that we demand from a good chase (no flower or fruit stand though). The chase ends when Tony and the suspect flip their cars on a highway and Tony gets some vital information from the suspect. It leads him to a jewelry store where the necklace was stolen during a heist. What Tony discovers he almost can't handle.  His sister is not as innocent as he believed, which forces him to free Dr. Tracer. When Tony sees a composite drawing of one of the suspects at the jewelry heist, it turns out to be Louise in disguise. Since a person was killed in the heist, was Louise responsible?
  This film brought a flood of memories back to me since it was one of the films that played endlessly on HBO during its early years. Director Alberto De Martino (THE BLANCHEVILLE MONSTER - 1963; THE TEMPTER - 1974; BLOOD LINK - 1983), using his frequent ""Martin Herbert"" pseudonym,  films this like a giallo film, as we don't know who the killer is, there are plenty of red herrings and deaths, as well as some funny dialogue. When the blind Julie says she heard a certain person kill Margie, Tony and Sgt. Matthews find that person dead, hanging from his neck. Sgt. Matthew turns to Tony and says, ""Maybe Julie can identify him!"" Besides that one line of dialogue, John Saxon is wasted here in a thankless role. The screenplay, by ""Vincent Mann"" (Vincenzo Mannino; HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK - 1979) & ""Frank Clark"" (Gianfranco Clerici; DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING - 1972), is very twisty, but it is not hard to figure out who the killer really is.  Half the fun of watching this film are the events that lead up to the reveal, such as the trannie fight (which was heavily edited for its TV showings) and the excellent car chase. This is Stuart Whitman's film all the way. I was surprised to learn that Whitman was still alive (he turned 90 in February 2018), as I haven't seen him in anything for years. He's quite good here, as are the supporting cast, especially the late Martin Landau. This was made during the summer break, when he was on hiatus filming SPACE: 1999 (1975 - 1977) and 18 years before he won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD (1994).
  Filmed as UNA MAGNUM SPECIAL PER TONY SAITTA (""A Magnum Special For Tony Saitta"") and also known as BLAZING MAGNUM, this film has a U.S. theatrical release (as STRANGE SHADOWS IN AN EMPTY ROOM) from American International Pictures (A.I.P.), with a fullscreen VHS release by Vestron Video in 1985. The DVD and Blu-Ray, from Scorpion Releasing/Kino Lorber, is in its OAR and uncut. It looks and sounds great, especially the squealing tires during the chase scene (My neighbor from the next apartment heard it and wanted to know what I was watching. He stayed and watched the rest of the film with me, borrowing my disc so he could watch the full film. If that isn't an endorsement, I don't know what is!). Films like this could have only come  from the ""anything goes"" '70s and I'm glad I lived (and survived) that decade. Also starring Jean Marchand, Anthony Forrest (KILLER'S MOON - 1978); Julie Wildman (THEY CAME FROM WITHIN - 1975). Andre St-Laurent and Peter MacNeill (CATHY'S CURSE - 1977). Rated R.",1530057600,,7832,4.527581329561528
8748616,4,B01AVMS8U0,"I saw this film under the title ""Blazing Magnum"", which was clearly meant to emphasize Stuart Whitman's maverick cop character.  However, the film is more of a hard boiled murder mystery, then an action film.  That being said though, this film is very good as a mystery thriller.  We also get a terrific car chase at the beginning of the film.",1521763200,,343,4.590163934426229
8748617,3,B01AVMS8U0,"I barely remember this, hence the rating: it didn't impress me either way.
I believe I rented it because the director was compared favorably with Dario Argento.
So here is my point: if you are a Dario Argento fan, but not a fan of Italian cinema more generally, you may find this film ... unremarkable and the director not really worth following.
Then again, you might. But in either case, I suspect you will agree that he is /not/ another Argento.",1515024000,,448,4.54320987654321
8748618,5,B01AVMS8U0,"very enjoyable movie, especially the car chase. I will watch it again. keeps you on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend.",1472688000,,126,4.521739130434782
8748619,4,B01AVMS8U0,"Here we have an unusual hybrid of genres blending the Crime film with Giallo who-done-it slasher murders.  Director Alberto Di Martino's 'SHADOWS IN AN EMPTY ROOM' aka 'BLAZING MAGNUM' aka 'UNA MAGNUM SPECIAL PER TONY SAITTA'-1976 utilizes American actors and an Italian film crew lensed in Montreal, Canada.  Pretty Carole Laure is poisoned at a college party where there are many suspects including Martin Landau and Gayle Hunnicutt.  Unfortunately , she happens to be Stuart Whitman's sister who is a no holds barred shoot first ask questions later kind of cop who teams up with John Saxon to find the murderer.  De Martino throws car chases, expensive necklaces, transvestites, and Giallo trappings to tell the story which emerges as one of his most accomplished works.  Dipping into many genres during the Sixties and Seventies ( my favorites are 'OPERATION KID BROTHER' aka 'OK CONNERY' -1965 and 'THE ANTICHRIST' aka 'L'ANTICRISTO' -1974) usually borrowing themes from American counterparts,  this film scribed by Vincenzo Mannino and Gianfranco Clerici flows pretty well throwing the audience clues at a rapid clip till it's semi surprise clinax.  Lensed by one of the masters, Aristede Massaccesi here billed as Anthony Ford who was a Director in his own right (the Photography in the car chase choreographed by Remy Julienne is awesome) and with a catchy music score by Armando Trovajoli (utilizing motifs and themes from his score from Director Anton Giulio Majano's 'SEDDOK L'EREDE DI SATANA' aka 'ATOM AGE VAMPIRE'-1960) , and a special cameo from actress Tisa Farrow (Mia's sister), it emerges as a nice entertaining time waster with one of Whitman's best performances.  The 1080p Blu-Ray by Kino Lorber is no great shakes with the soundtrack fluctuating from loud to soft with a grainy negative so the DVD purchase wouldn't hurt and has the original AIP trailer plus other trailers as the only extras.",1471046400,2,1916,5.158064516129032

8748621,5,B01AVMS8U0,"""Strange Shadows in an Empty Room"" (1977) is a very enjoyable movie, but can not be said to be very good.  Also known as ""Blazing Magnum,"" the film is directed by Alberto de Martino, the Italian director who specializes in the Italian rip-off of American blockbusters, this being his answer to ""Dirty Harry""and ""Magnum Force""  He was also responsible for the Italian ""Godfather"" called ""The Counselor"" and the Italian ""The Exorcist"", the very hard to watch ""The Anti-Christ"" and his rip-off ""The Omen"" was ""Holocaust 2000.""  Each one of these has scenes that pushes the envelope, but the director seems mired down by his own imitations.  ""Strange Shadows in an Empty Room"" as it was originally called by AIP upon release here stars Stuart Whitman in one of his best performances.  It contains a car chase the outdoes the one in ""The French Connection"" and after some twenty minutes of elaborate and damaging car chase, Whitman lets the villain off with a question that leads to his next scene.  What could have been something great, becomes little more than a re-heated pasta dish.  The great cast includes Martin Landau, John Saxon, Gayle Hunnicutt, Tisa Farrow and Carol Laure as Whitman's kid sister, the murder victim, who seems more like she should be his daughter.  The movie is chock full of sensational action, characters. one-liners, etc. that is most consistently watchable like waiting for a trainwreck and the film delivers, but is more of a guilty pleasure than ever like watching a good film.  The score by Armando Travajoli is exciting.  The blu-ray is quite good, as good as the film deserves, but is grainy and with some imperfections.  The color is by Movielab.  Kino Lorber and Scorpion Releasing had the smarts to bring it to us.",1464307200,7,1749,4.871621621621622
8748622,5,B01AVMS8U0,"A 1976 classic released in 1977 also known as Blazing Magnum starring three of my favorite performers Stuart Whitman, John Saxon and Martin Landau as well as the talented Gayle Hunnicutt, looking radiant. Wide screen print is sharp and clear though slightly grainy which adds to the look of the film. Color is good.  Action scenes are fast and furious with a memorable opening score. The cover is reversible with the poster for Blazing Magnum as well. A fine job all round.",1462233600,11,473,4.7682926829268295
8748623,5,B01AVMS8U0,"No, but he did star in The Ransom(aka Maniac) in 1977.  this is a great police thriller filmed in Canada. Good acting, a great cast, and the car chase is indeed impressive! Been looking for this film for years, And can't wait to get a copy now that it's finally available!! Sit back and enjoy another underrated gem!!",1457222400,10,317,4.4655172413793105
