8261736,5,B00169NAHY,"I started doing Butterfly guard years ago when it was first introduced to me at a Royler Gracie seminar.  Kesting breaks down the butterfly guard down better then Gracie did!
I was worried that the x-guard may be too complex for my game but the way that kesting breaks it down I was able to use it almost immediately.
Awesome product!  Thanks Stephan!",1433289600,2,351,4.555555555555555
