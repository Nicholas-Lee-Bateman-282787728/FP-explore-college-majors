8243634,2,B00122M2QA,"I got this DVD a week or two ago and I must say I disagree with most of the other reviews.  I bought it based solely on the reviews, which makes it seem as though this is the best quick licks DVD available.  If it is the best, I won't buy any more based on this single purchase.

Don't get me wrong, there are some fun things to play and the instructor explains a little bit about the importance of knowing what key you're in and some general pointers for soloing over a slow blues type song (Since I've Been Loving You, to be exact.)  I'm just disappointed because this instructor in no way, shape or form plays like Jimmy Page (in technique nor note choice.)  Just because you figure out some stuff to play over a ""Since I've Been Loving You"" backing track, doesn't mean it will sound like Jimmy Page is playing it.  Maybe he plays the proper way, spreading his fingers way out, using his pinky all of the time or whatever, but I've never seen Page play like that or any of the licks that he teaches.  I use the term ""teaches"" lightly.  All he does is name the frets and strings, play it and move along.  You may as well just try to learn a Jimmy Page solo by ear, really.  If you're a big fan of Page and have watched and listened to many live and studio performances,  you know that Page will play slow, explode into something very quick (generally the same formula in the first part of the pentatonic minor scale) and slow down again.  This teacher plays very properly and precisely, note for note.  He doesn't demonstrate too many bends or anything too fast, and the faster stuff doesn't involve bends, which page did ALL the time to start out any quick run.  The licks he does are very melodic, not really bluesy at all.  I don't know about everyone else, but when I think of Jimmy Page I think of hard blues rock, which these licks are not.  I'm sure this guy is a great guitarist and has learned a thing or two from Satriani, but Satriani and Page are two totally different players.

I'd also like to mention that the production quality of the video is sub-par, but the backing track is actually pretty well done, which is the only thing that impressed me.

In conclusion, like a previous reviewer said, if you are into metal soloing then this DVD will probably give you some decent ideas.  If you're into the blues and want to learn Jimmy Page type stuff, don't bother buying this DVD.  Spend 15-20 bucks on a blues licks book and/or listen to Led Zeppelin songs and figure out Page's method through trial and error.",1297900800,,2526,4.345415778251599
8243635,4,B00122M2QA,"What everyone else here has said I agree with. Great DVD for learning an interesting blues progression. The last chords of the progression are an interesting twist on the typical I, IV, V pattern of most blues and present a challenge to hit the right passing notes during the quick succession of chord changes in the last few bars. As pointed out by others, there are no tabs. I think these would be helpful, just to be able to confirm what it is you are seeing on the DVD.

My major complaint about this DVD (thus 4 stars) is that I would like to have the jam backing track in MP3 so that I can play it through my studio rig. There doesn't appear to be an intuitive way of ripping the DVD files to MP3, so I'm pretty much stuck with putting the DVD player in my PC anytime I want to jam along with the backing track :-(  If anyone knows how to get around this, let me know.

Danny Gill is a great teacher and he does a nice job of explaining the licks in all the parts. I found that I spent a lot of time just observing the intro guitar solo as I liked a lot of the licks that are done in this sequence. I found it somewhat curious that the lick lessons don't match the intro solo. Definitely worth the $20, as you will get at least 10 live lessons worth of material from this DVD in the comfort of your own home.

I have been purchasing DVDs from Metal Methods, an outfit out of LA that has some interesting material. I especially liked Sarah Spicek's ""Metal Riffology"" DVD set that covers many interesting metal style rhythm riffs. I also purchased some of the Michael Angelo Batio DVDs such as ""Speed Kills"" and ""Jam Along with BAT"". The Jam Along one was the best of these in my opinion, as any DVD lesson that includes both the artist solo followed by explanations and then a jam track provide a great learning experience. Again, I think Danny Gil has an excellent teaching style and articulates the concepts and theory of his approach to soloing over this progression.

I'm interested in purchasing more of the Quick Lick series if someone would recommend some others. I play classic rock, blues and hard rock using both Les Paul and Ibanez solid body guitars. E-mail me at kevmclau@yahoo.com. Thx",1276214400,,2204,4.35279805352798
8243636,4,B00122M2QA,"Danny Gill's videos are very clear. This is a C minor Blues DVD. There is no tab included (not even a pdf, minus 2 stars), but Danny clearly states which string/fret each note is as he slowly plays the solos (add a star back). Thus, you can listen to the DVD and quickly transcribe - if you are so inclined. The first solo is a 12-bar blues in Cmin. There are 9 licks that make up the full solo. He plays the full 12-bar solo first at full speed, then demos each lick. He plays the lick at full speed, then walks through the lick slowly. At the end, there is a backing track. He does the same thing for the next two blues solos, for a total of three blues solos.

Theses aren't Led Zeppelin songs. They are blues songs ""in the style of"" Jimmy Page. Good stuff nonetheless.",1268697600,,772,4.1466666666666665
8243637,4,B00122M2QA,"Danny Gill is an excellent player and teacher. Tons of great licks over a C minor rock-blues. Danny is a very clean player and my only critique would be that his playing somewhat lacks the rhythmic nuances that Jimmy Page is (in)famous for. No tab, but I believe one learns more effectively without the tab, as it makes the student actually listen to the phrases, and commit them to memory. I have about 15 of these Quick Licks DVD's and I believe they are the best on the market. The Larry Carlton, Yngwie, Steve Vai, and Jeff Beck DVD's are my personal faves. There is much quality knowledge to be gleaned from these great learning tools!",1237248000,3,640,4.525862068965517
8243638,5,B00122M2QA,"First I would like to say that this is not my first quick licks DVD. I kind of knew what to expect but this DVD actually beat my expectations. The material is laid out perfectly and the solos get progressively more challenging. There are 3 solos in total, each spanning over the 12 bars in the Jam. If like me, you play mainly metal and wanted to spice up your style, this is the DVD for you. This is challenging material, and especially challenging to someone used to playing 4/4 time all the time.
Apart from the solos, the DVD contains a section that explains the jam and chords bar by bar, and goes thru an array of scales that sound great with the chord progression. This DVD also includes the backing jam track so you can practice what your learn in context. I've been playing for a while so I know this is definitely NOT FOR A BEGINNER...Although with enough patience and lots of practice, anyone can learn this material. I am a 100% Danny Gill fan as he is a fantastic teacher. I've seen many people complain that these DVDs do not include any tabs, and they don't. But so what...It's a DVD. Hit rewind if you miss something. Bottom line is, if you ever heard some awesome sounding blues and wondred how they did it because you can't seem to make your guitar sound like that, then BUY THIS DVD.",1222300800,6,1302,4.362139917695473
8243639,5,B00122M2QA,"This guitar DVD is by far the best i have purchsed yet, and i have about 30 instructinal dvd's.
The backing track is well done and so is the lesson. Which is broken into sections to make learning easier. Danny Gill is now one of my favorite teachers...he takes it slow and easy with each portion of the solos. And you will need it!! for some of these great Jimmy Page Lick's. Finally there is a DVD that features never done before licks that are for intermediate players. What makes this dvd so interesting is that you won't get tired of it due to its complex nature, not to say that even beginners will walk away with better tiiming and structure to thier soloing. The other benefit is that it isn't just standard blues style stuff there are some very melodic solos on this DVD.And it is the first to incorporate proper timming into the flow of soloing as well, Danny counts off each solo run so it makes it easier to understand how each part fits together as a whole.
Absolutly Great! The Best I have Played To Yet. Buy It, you won't be sorry you did i swear.",1209859200,11,1061,4.31
