7972466,5,B00006RCO9,So funny! I watched it the first day it arrived. It had never been opened and the disc was in perfect condition!,1396828800,,112,4.136363636363637
7972467,4,B00006RCO9,"This DVD comes from the second ""reunion"" tour of The Kids in the Hall. There is alot of material you will recognize from the CBC/HBO TV show and new sketches featuring characters you'll recognize from the show. Monty Python's Live at the Hollywod Bowl is basically the same as this. Live versions of mostly older material and it's pretty good though I found myself preferring the older versions myself.

The DVD is short on special features and that knocks this down a star. It offers a backstage view option during some (and between) sketches. That alone seperates this from a standard stage performance on DVD.

It's worth picking up if you wish to see The Kids live. I hope, one day they can put out a similar DVD of their2008 tour which was entirely new material (and with new characters as well)

I recommend The Kids in the Hall complete series DVD which has bonus footage featuring the Troupe prior to their TV Show at the Rivoli in Toronto.",1382832000,,948,4.597633136094674
7972468,1,B00006RCO9,"Brought it for $3.99 at a Big Lots, thinking it would be funny, Since I am a fan of the show, Total Waste, Waste of time and money, Not worth the 3.99+tax. not even 99 cents. Fans of the show should stay away and watch The Show, it is much more entertaining than this.",1246665600,2,268,3.9814814814814814
7972469,5,B00006RCO9,I absolutely loved this tour! Bruce was kind enough to give me second row center seats! So of course watching this reminds me of that wonderful day! I guess if you missed out on this tour it might have a different feel for you. I only wish the would have taped the 2008 tour! All new stuff! what were they thinking!!! Anyways a must have for anyone that saw the 2002 tour!,1223942400,2,372,4.180555555555555
7972470,4,B00006RCO9,"I was disappointed at the lack of original material on this disc. It is some of their best sketches - word for word - performed onstage, including the Chicken Lady and Kathy and Cathy. There is a new Buddy Cole sketch which is lukewarm, a likewise mediocre Headcrusher skit and the Dr. Suess bible thing...whaaa?

I'm glad I only rented this and not purchased it, but it does give you a Kids fix if you really need it. Why can they can put Friends and that junk out on DVD season by season but no Kids? Come on! Kids on DVD! Kids on DVD!",1058486400,22,537,4.163461538461538
7972471,5,B00006RCO9,"This is the best us Kids fans are going to get until the original episodes make it to DVD (cross your fingers).  However, it's a good DVD that captures a pretty good performance.  Most of the classic characters make an appearance, including the Head Crusher, Simon Milligan & Hecubus, Gavin, and a good new monologue from Buddy Cole (dealing with, of course, dressing in drag in Afghanistan), among others.
Essential for all KITH fans, but it will become obsolete when we get the episodes on DVD.",1056240000,14,496,4.755813953488372
7972472,5,B00006RCO9,"These piddly DVDs of tours and such are all well and good, but they don't hold a 1/2 candle power candle to the original series.  How long until the fans get Kids episodes on DVD?  For this is what we truly want, and will pay a hefty ransom for them to be set free, emblazoned on Digital Versatile Discs!",1055116800,12,304,4.135593220338983
7972473,2,B00006RCO9,"I have to say that this concert DVD is so disappointingly unfunny..it makes you long for the days of their original series.  As an avid fan of KITH I wish they would return to TV comedy and leave behind their half baked attempts at touring.  I recommend their previous DVD ""Same Guys New Dresses"" although that DVD is more of a ""behind-the-scenes"" documentary.  You have to give the guys credit, though, for still performing together.  TOD mostly rehashes old KITH sketches (albeit a little more raunchy than the originals)..most of which falls flat..even Scott Thompson's ""Buddy Cole"" sketch falls far short of his classic original sketches.  They may be older..but their not wiser.  Let's not even bring up the camera work and sound editing (the disc and packaging lack imagination)..seems like the work of an amateur.  All in all..this concert simply rehashes old sketches..you will have that ""seen this before"" feeling while watching it.  Hopefully someone will release the complete original series on DVD like so many sitcoms and shows are doing.",1051747200,4,1051,5.069767441860465
7972474,3,B00006RCO9,"The Kids' performances are as good as ever - they're all older and look it, but effortlessly slip back into the troupe. Their sketch comedy translates surprisingly well to the live stage.
However, the video quality of this DVD is not up to par - there are extremely bad compression artifacts throughout. Although the packaging trumpets ""wide screen"" in several places, the image is in fact a 4:3 letterbox, not actual wide screen. The menu interface is minimal and amateur. One unique feature, ""Behind the Screens"" shows the activity backstage via a couple of stationary cameras - but there is little to see, and once you go backstage, there seems to be no way to skip these long, boring segments and return to where the action is. If I didn't know better, I'd have thought that his DVD was created in someone's basement using amateur tools and talents.",1048636800,3,853,4.77027027027027
7972475,4,B00006RCO9,"Everyone who saw the Kids In The Hall on their 2002 ""Tour Of Duty"" had to be hoping that a home video version of the show would come out - and now here it is! While I can't remember every single sketch the Kids did - in my case, at the Landmark Theatre in Syracuse - rest assured - a lot of classuc characters like Simon Milligan and the Head-Crushing Guy make appearances, as well as a few new sketches written post - 9/11.
The cast really responded to the energy of a live show, though on the night I saw them, Kevin McDonald was pretty much voted Kid In The Hall Most Liable To Break Up During A Sketch.
This was a very skillfully performed sketch show with terrific, functional screen backdrops and excellent sound. If you loved the KITH live, you'll want to own the DVD or video.",1036800000,13,784,4.233333333333333
