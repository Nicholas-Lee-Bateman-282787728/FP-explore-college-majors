8379490,1,B002SQJFSC,"I had a chance to watch this on Youtube. It's terrible. It doesn't stick to the topic at all. Instead of being a movie about costume players, it wastes too much time on voice actors, video game players, and how anime doesn't make enough money to support it's production. Wah wah!!! Cry me a river. I love anime and I pay for it. Stop your whining and make something that is actually about costume play. This isn't. It's a complete false representation of what the movie is about. It's long, boring, and generally looks terrible. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Watch it on Youtube for free, if at all.",1354406400,,615,4.451327433628318
8379491,5,B002SQJFSC,"A very interesting insight into the world of cosplay. Looking at the people behind the costume as much as the costumes themselves, this is a must see documentary.",1343088000,2,162,4.821428571428571
8379492,1,B002SQJFSC,"As stated before, the use of copy written material with out permission is a serious concern for this creator.  Add to it the lack of any depth to this DVD makes it nearly needless, especially since it's online for free.",1327708800,3,219,4.475

This is pretty much a ""what is cosplay for dummies."" Some of the interviews are ok, but there are odd cuts, wonky lighting, odd camera angles, and varrying sound levels. I'm pretty sure none of the anim footage they used was licensed. TV Tokyo, WOWOW, and Animax would probably be interested in knowing that. Really, all they have done is dummed down cosplay.

Don't buy this product.",1285891200,11,478,4.6
