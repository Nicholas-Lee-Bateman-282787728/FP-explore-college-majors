Of course, it does a splendid job at depicting Elizabeth Taylor's life and her hardships with relationships. What was my most favorite thing about this film? The astonishing wardrobe and the time settings this film has is captivating. The actress looks almost as stunning as Taylor and has a compelling way of acting that it feels so real. With this actress, there is no illusion and although some things in the movie is inaccurate to say the least, I love this film regardless.",1463616000,,561,4.564356435643564
8455191,5,B0053DA3EC,"This is a remarkably faithful account of the very public -and stormy- life of Elizabeth Taylor.  And to all other reviewers who insist on calling her ""Liz"" - she HATED that name.... and at first, this film... but later admitted that she thought it was pretty good.  And, it is.  The cast were chosen to at least resemble their real-life counterparts and the storyline highlights all of the major events [and God knows there were PLENTY!] of Elizabeth's story.  My only complaint is that this disc is still not available for sale in the US - I purchased mine from Canada- and it's not likely to be found on any shelves, ever.  With so many actual people portrayed [frequently in a true-to-life negative manner] it's a wonder their names were allowed to be used in this film and contractual stipulations are sure to keep this movie away from the general viewing pubic as long as possible.  But if you CAN snag a copy for yourself - of even just view it sometime - by all means do so if you are even a casual fan of the great Dame Elizabeth Taylor.  For, she is one woman who truly lived up to that title:  a great Dame!!",1437177600,,1118,4.393203883495145

8455193,4,B0053DA3EC,"The producers chose an insipid child actress to play the young Liz Taylor, and an actress who should give lessons in wild over-acting to play her impossible controlling mother. But beyond those mis-steps, this is a rather pleasing representation of Liz's life, at least to the point in it when this 2-part miniseries was made. Oddly, Sherilyn Fenn's hairstyles change throughout to match those of screen legend Elizabeth Taylor at the various points in her life represented, as does, of course, her wardrobe, but the producers elected NOT to show any aging beyond that by using phony-looking make-up, latex, etc. Maybe that was purposeful, however, because I kept thinking that's in keeping with Liz herself; a timeless, ageless beauty who dazzled audiences throughout her career. This respectful and loving tribute to the screen legend is WORLDS better than the dreadful recent Lindsay Lohan mess ""Liz and Dick"" , and though no actress can actually make you believe she IS Liz Taylor, Fenn puts forth a very worthy effort here, but it's a bit like the various Marilyn Monroe biopics that have been made...no actress can actually get to that point where you're transcended into a suspension of disbelief (Catherine Hicks, IMHO, achieved it closest in her portrayal of Monroe in ""Marilyn: The Untold Story"", in which there are scenes you could swear you're watching, if not Monroe herself, then at least her twin sister.). Playing Liz's various husbands was also no mean task here, but the gentlemen also did quite passable jobs (especially Mike Todd's surrogate!). All in all, this Lifetime presentation is well worth your time and is unabashed in its\reverence for its subject. Just work your way past the annoying kid in the opening sequences and you'll be good with it.",1359676800,,1772,5.051194539249146
8455194,5,B0053DA3EC,Love it! Best protrayAl of Elizabeth ever! Ms Flynn is a dead ringer for ms Taylor. I could watch this movie over and over and never get tired.,1356739200,3,143,4.142857142857143
