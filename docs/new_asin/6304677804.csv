7876576,4,6304677804,"Tidal waves,hat air baloons,erupting volcanos,convicts and good looking women. What else do you need.
 So Krakatoa is west of Java, I could have cared less.
 The special effects were excillent.
 Maxmillian Schell gives his usual good preformance as owner of salvage boat,Brian Keith is a diver with lung problems,
 Rossano Brazzi and son Sal Mineo try to spot werckage from air baloon,while John Leyton goes down in a deep sea bell and native girls dive down to the wreckage.
 Ending ,each person must choose to stay aboard salvage ship or take a smaller boat to a near by island,those that made wrong choice are doomed. Film will never make the greats,but for entertainment value I felt it moved right along,was easy to understand and preformances were steady but not great. Just don't take too seriously and you should enjoy it.",1012003200,9,830,4.9
