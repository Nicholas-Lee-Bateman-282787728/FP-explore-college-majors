8180393,4,B000NP3ZSG,"Coastal Command: The movie was shot on base during the war with actual aircrew and ground staff. My father remembers some of the ""actors"" and assures me they didn't really talk like that. He suggests they ""camped it up"" a bit for the film. Nonetheless a realistic portrayal of the long, lonely and often dangerous operations of Coastal Command during the war.
Black Cats: The often forgotten saga of employment of an obsolete aircraft for uses for which it was never designed (""dive""  bombing and torpedo dropping to say the least). My Uncle flew these out of Rathmines during the war, dropping coastwatchers on Japanese-occupied islands. They perfomed amazing feats of endurance on long, lonely and dangerous patrols.
Quality of both films is comparable to other archive films available from the period, and presented in a compact package that runs on most regionfree DVD's.
If like me, you miss the era of the flying boats, these aree a valuable addition to your library. Almost as good as being there.",1184630400,8,1004,4.940828402366864
