7914106,4,B00000K2TB,"Dark Harvest is one of those movies you'd find in a blockbuster video rental store because blockbuster needed to fill it's shelves. It's a plus and a minus. In one sense, anyone could make anything and get in seen. In another sense, it was a huge detriment for the same reason. Thankfully, Dark Harvest is hilariously inept. I can't explain much without giving away the many hilarious and hair brained turns the movie takes. They throw just about every single 80s horror movie convention into the film and then add 80s and 90s independent relationship drama on top. It's a heady mixture of bad ideas that got some good belly laughs out of me.

Intervision has reproduced the movie in the best way possible. Directly lifting the film from a VHS to a DVD with no up-scaling or improvements of any kind. It feels like you're watching a grubby VHS from a rental store that smells like the many armpits it's been under. It might seem weird but it's a solid recreation of a particular experience long dead now due to the internet. It makes for the viewing of the film a lot more fun.

The back up Vincent Price feature is a solid bonus and self referential to the DVD you're buying in a way that can't help but be ironic hippy humor. It's fun too and of course you get Vincent Price as a Crypt Keeper of sorts. So, solid double bill",1501632000,,1326,4.430327868852459
7914107,5,B00000K2TB,Dark Harvest was a basic horror type movie.  I purchased this for the added content.  Escapes is great.  I have wanted it on DVD for many many years.,1500508800,,149,4.25
7914108,4,B00000K2TB,"Overall, this is a wonderful release of two cult horror movies that otherwise would've drifted into the ether.  Intervision is the tops.  Whatever horror they release, put me down for a copy.

Butt kissing aside, Dark Harvest is a mixed bag.  I dig the shot on video aspect.  There's a few really good horror scenes and a few surprises.  The character interaction is interesting, though talky and drags on.  The scarecrow story is convoluted (probably on purpose because of its cheapness) and won't make a ton of sense.  Not a terrible movie, though only average.  3/5.

Escapes is the real treat.  I love anthology horror, especially old school stuff.  ""Coffee Break"" is my favorite story of the pack.  4/5.  Sorry I missed this back in the heyday of the rental market.

The extras are good on this.  Nice interviews.  Good job, Intervision!",1496707200,4,842,4.816901408450704

7914110,4,B00000K2TB,"The film is about a van full of people heading to a ranch in the desert, but on their way, the van breaks down, and they are forced to hike their way there. Little do they know that a variety of scarecrows are unhappy  about their trek through the supposedly ancient Indian burial ground, and  the group pays dearly for their invasion.
Not a terrible movie, but  definitely not flawless. There were some generally creepy scenes and one  very disturbing scene of a dead girl hanging from the ceiling on an old  abandoned farm by one foot, swinging. The characters were all able to be  cared for, and the acting wasn't as bad as expected. My main problem with  the whole film was the ending. There was no climax whatsoever, and the film  ends on an odd note. Not a very gratifying finale. But still, it's a pretty  cool movie, though, the scarecrows are pretty doofy, and where did the  helicopter the one scarecrow was in come from? And why didn't the final  three just fight him off and fly away? I dunno, check it out.",947808000,2,1019,4.424731182795699
