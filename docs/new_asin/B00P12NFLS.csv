8686043,1,B00P12NFLS,total waste of money .. was not advertised as region 2 only when I purchased.,1484784000,,77,4.2
8686044,1,B00P12NFLS,The format not suitable for united states equipment. AT least now the ad contains a  disclaimer. This was a waste of money.,1445299200,2,123,4.590909090909091
8686045,1,B00P12NFLS,"Beware of false advertising. I pre-ordered the DVD because the ad stated that this version of the film (formerly titled The Poker House) was NC-17 with a running time of 96 minutes, which would be 3 minutes longer than the R-rated U.S. release. It's actually 89 minutes and on the back of the DVD case it says that the film is safe for viewers 15 years and older. For those thinking about buying this, this film is NOT 96 minutes and it is NOT NC-17. But for those who haven't seen this yet, this is actually pretty good, just don't buy this version.",1429747200,5,550,4.349514563106796
8686046,3,B00P12NFLS,"The Poker House is the same movie, regular DVD, but rated R. NC-17???",1422057600,5,69,4.384615384615385
8686047,4,B00P12NFLS,It turned out much more brutal than we had thought but was still all in all a good bit of horror. Though I can't say it was a turn on.,1232323200,9,134,3.5
