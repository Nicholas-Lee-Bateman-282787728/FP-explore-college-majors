7826005,5,6302424305,"It was the first season of Star Trek. And the show had its shakey beginnings. But despite the show's struggles in the first season, a few gems came out from the first 15 episodes, such as Where No One Has Gone Before and Datalore. This episode, The Big Goodbye, is my First Season show, and one of my personal favorites from the show's entire 7 year run. It was the first ""holodeck goes wrong"" storylines. The coolest part of the show is of course the costumes. There is nothing cooler than Captain Picard and Data in 1940 detective suits. It looked accurate to what some people wore at the time. Also the guest apperance of Lawerance Tierny was a plus. This show won many awards for TNG, including the Peabody Award, the Hugo Award for best dramatic presentation and a couple emmys. And of course, who can forget Picard's line of trying to explain Data's apperance ""He's from South America"" This is one the best episodes of the first season. It was an episode that I grew up loving as a kid. And any trekkie, will love this episode as well.",1119225600,,1041,4.455497382198953
7826006,4,6302424305,"This highly underrated first season episode of TNG is actually the best of the holodeck episodes. Looking for a break in the goings-on of the Federation, Captain Picard seeks refuge in the guise of Detective Dixon Hill. In the meantime, the crew is preparing for peace talks with the hostile Jerada. When the ship is scanned by the Jeradan flagship, Picard, Data, Dr. Crusher, and Expendable Crewman #13h are trapped in the holodeck and the safety has been turned off, making fake bullets real! The suspense mounts up to the creative ending. All of the guest stars do very well and provide a neat contrast with 1930s literature and 24th century universe. It's a great, fun episode with Trek lore perfectly in tact.",1043193600,,714,4.813008130081301
7826007,5,6302424305,"I was originally quite skeptical about Paramount producing a new Trek television series along with many others. My dubious instinct proved to be prophetic as ST:TNG began it's network run.  I found the first several episodes were hardly worth sitting through and I was ready to write the series off.  But show's like ""The Battle"" and ""Hide And Q"" kept me coming back the next week and hoping for more excellence.  ""The Big Goodbye"" is the episode that singlehandedly won my allegiance as a fan.
Though the holodeck would be returned to for several more 'star-turns' in other shows, this one remains my favorite.  This parody of the film noir classic ""The Maltese Falcon"" is expertly written and faultlessly performed.  The Enterprise crew members reactions to the holodeck characters are played mostly for laughs and therefore to great effect.  ""The Big Goodbye"" also features one of Next Generation's finest ensemble supporting casts.  Harvey Jason, as Felix Leach, is an absolute riot as a poor man's Peter Lorre; Lawrence Tierney, doubling for Sydney Greenstreet, is commanding as the proper but nefarious Cyrus Redblock - his best role in years prior to being in ""Reservoir Dogs""; cult film star Dick Miller appears as a newstand vendor; William Boyett, who appeared in several episodes of television's ""Dragnet, shows up as a brow-beating police detective.
Tracy Torme, who scripted this Peabody Award winning episode, created a totally unique and ingenious plot by having Enterprise crew members get trapped in the past without even leaving the ship.  The Star Trek production team also does a marvelous job of creating the effect of the holodeck as well the attention to period detail.  Arguably the best episode from the inaugural TNG season but most certainly the best looking one.",1037404800,,1790,5.102739726027397
7826008,5,6302424305,"The Big Good-bye ......or Trek Fiction
Where's Bogie when you need em'?  The hard boiled detective named Dixon Hill.  He's a character created from the Next Generation's holodeck.  It enables the crew to live out experiences without harm to themselves or anyone else. This one is based on Picard's readings of an ancient fictional detective.
This one happens to be Picard's favorite.  From a guy who's reading goes from Shakespeare to pulp fiction.  This episode might've worked if it were filmed in black and white.  All the camera work was attempting to capture that film noir feel.  Naturally, as with all the holodeck episodes something goes horribly wrong!  The bad guys become as lethal as they do in real time!  Data,Crusher and Whalen join Dixon Hill to figure out how to open the holo-door to their Enterprise again.
Lawrence Tierney, of the old time gangster movies, plays the baddie in this one.  I wish he returned for another Dixon Hill adventure.  His character gave credibility to an otherwise surreal episode.",979603200,,1025,4.970588235294118
7826009,3,6302424305,"There some excellent scenes in this episode. 1. Picard discribing the new holodeck programme to his colleagues and Crusher's reaction to his invitation. 2. The holodeck programme scenes until Redblock appears. The Picard/Crusher scene is quite funny.
After that it slows down until picking up at the end.
Also watch out for one of the worst continuity mistakes in a  st-tng episode. Why is there no one outside the holodeck to greet them?",978134400,4,438,5.0
7826010,4,6302424305,"One of the few good episodes from the show's first season! While waiting for a meeting with an alien race called the Jarada, Picard visits the Holodeck where he plays the fictional character Dixon Hill.  Dr. Crusher,  Data and the ship's historian also visit with Picard, but when the  Enterprise is attacked, the Holodeck malfunctions and places Picard and  crew in danger in 1941 San Francisco, with the safeguards off!",961804800,5,421,4.9714285714285715
