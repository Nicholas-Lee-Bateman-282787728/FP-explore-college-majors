5495127,5,B00ARWX8BE,"Growing up, I loved ballet class. My mom took me to dance once a week and I always enjoyed tap dancing, but absolutely LOVED ballet! The cute tutu, my hair twisted up in a bun, and my pretty little ballet slippers made me feel like a princess. Fast forward thirty years, and I have two little nieces who adore ballet. They are petite and graceful. I love watching them twirl in the living room and show me their dance moves.

When they come to visit, the idea of watching transformers is not on their list of ""fun"" things to do. As a mom of two boys, I'm not necessarily stocked up on girly DVDs. However, when I was given the chance to review, Angelina Ballerina: The Mousling Mysteries I couldn't wait to show them. I'm not going to lie...not only did they enjoy it, I loved watching it, and so did my two boys! (Shh! We won't tell their daddy though!)

This movie of Angelina is set up as a mystery. The kids were glued to the tv as the clues were given and the mystery unfolded. Gracie thinks Roquefort Hall is haunted because they hear scary noises. Angelina must go on a hunt to figure out what they heard and what has happened to Marco's music. The music and interesting names draw the kids in and keeps their attention. Kids need a little mystery in their shows and this was a perfect blend of mystery, without anything being scary.

If you have a ballerina in your house (and even if you don't), you will want to check out this DVD. Grab your blanket, your kids, and your popcorn, and snuggle in for a movie as you become the detective to help solve the mystery in Angelina Ballerina: The Mousling Mysteries!!",1363046400,,1618,4.368770764119601
