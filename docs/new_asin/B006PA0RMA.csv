5012395,1,B006PA0RMA,Not that I hate the show but the original Naruto series gave us loyal fans an average of 25 episodes per boxset.  Viz (or whoever produces the boxsets) are only giving us 11 to 13 episodes of Shippuden per boxset and for a higher price!  What a ripoff!  Why are they doing this?  And considering how long this show is running (and will continue to run for some time) you'd think they'd put more episodes in a boxset.  Until they start adding at least another 10 episodes per boxset I will no longer waste my money on Shippuden but continue watching online.......FOR FREE!,1329004800,,571,4.504854368932039
5012396,5,B006PA0RMA,these movies  are great i love narruto movies but why do they take so long tobring them out i mean i have to wait 2 or more months to buy the next box set i don't like that they should go back to bringing them out every month like before,1327795200,5,237,3.74

Here we are finally getting back to the main story arc.

As weird as it may sound I cried when Orochimaru and Deidara died. Two of my favorite characters killed in the same set. It was very sad and worth it.",1401840000,,359,4.343283582089552

5012429,5,B006PA0RMA,"I am a big fan of the series. I think that each box set is a must. While there are a few episodes that kind of seem to drag, you will appreciate that there aren't filler episodes in  this box set. Some episodes are action packed and some get bogged down by too many flash backs and back ground story set up. Stop here if for spoiler alert!!!

This box set includes Sasuke's fight with Deidara, the story behind Kakashi's sharingan, and a prelude to things to come which will make sense much, much later. This is among some of the must haves for those collecting the Naruto Shippuden box sets.",1381881600,,592,4.324324324324325

5012431,5,B006PA0RMA,"Great story. I love when anime progress stories like this. The original naruto series was well written. Each character was interesting. Alot of touching moments. Especially naruto,always trying to inspire an help. This continues in Shippuden. EXcept,the characters aged a few years. Which is what I meant by progression. Im not going to explain what each set is about. Just know this series is addictive. So if you get the chance,buy alot or all sets at once. I got all 15 on sale almost half off. 20ish$$$ a set. Im a little disappointed in the length of time it took to ship from Amazon LLC.5 business days just to be shipped. But arrived shortly after. The sets are kinda a ripoff considering each set is 11-13 episodes. But on sale it was a must buy. For 330$ I got 15 sets instead of paying
660$.I love this show and will keep buying. Set 16 is due to release in october 2013.

5012435,5,B006PA0RMA,The set has episodes in English and you have multiple subtitle options. Theres music and little fun skits with the show characters between episodes. There are also some really awesome previews for other anime and you can skip them if you want or watch them at the end of the dvds. The dvd has episode index and cool art.

5012444,5,B006PA0RMA,"I purchased this box set from RightStuf.com when it first released back in April and I gotta say, this is when Shippuden starts getting good.

We see Sasuke forming his team 'Hebi', Kakashi's past in the 2 bonus Kakashi Chronicles episodes you get on the second disc in the set and then we get to see an awesome finale of Sasuke vs. the Akatsuki's Deidara in a battle to the death which will have you at the edge of your seat the entire time.

Animation, episodes and overall package design was good in this set, I didn't find anything to complain about myself, especially because we got 14 episodes compared to 12 or 13 which is always a nice bonus.

Things are only going to get better in box set 11, trust me. This is where things start getting good in the Shippuden series and you won't want to miss a second of it.",1341273600,,819,4.305194805194805
5012445,4,B006PA0RMA,"I would just like to note for the unaware, the Kakashi chronicles that are listed on the box as extra content are not extra. They go along with the rest of the story, and if you are watching play all, they will play on their own. I also remember watching them as the show originally released. The box set is great, just don't get your hopes up on the false advertising on the box.",1340150400,,380,4.148648648648648

5012448,5,B006PA0RMA,"This was a must see. I saw the episodes on the internet & knew that I must get when it was released.
It answers questions you have wondered about.
It leaves you wanting to watch more. The draw back is not enough episodes in this set as with all the other box sets. This set ends probably better than most as it concludes one story & gets set to start the next.
I would like set boxes to contain four disk sets & sneek preview of the next set as was the case with the naruto set boxes.
If your a fan like me it is worth getting to add to your growing collection as your well aware that this set will take up alot of space where you store them as this series keeps going.
Even the fillers are not as bad to watch as they can add to the characters profile & relate to who they have become.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naruto-Shippuden-Set-Ten/dp/B006PA0RMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naruto Shippuden: Set Ten</a>",1336435200,4,951,4.734939759036145

5012450,5,B006PA0RMA,"Set 10 has some of the best episodes in Naruto Shippuden so far. This set has 14 episodes that continue the main story after the death of Hidan and Kakuzu from set 7.
(Spoilers)
We start with Orochimaru being ready for taking Sasuke's body. We get to see Orochimarus backround on how he left the leaf village and how he betrayed the Akatsuki. Then we follow Sasuke as he gathers rouge shinobis to create his team for hunting down Itachi. After that theres an awesome fight between Sasuke and Deidara as they fight for there life. Also we get to see how Deidara joined the Akatsuki.
This set offers nice suprices + theres the 2 bonus episodes called ""Kakashi Chronicles"" that basic show how Kakashi got the Sharigan. Great episodes for fans of Kakashi. They are both action and emotional.
This set is a must have for every Naruto fan and personally i cant wait for DvD set 11!",1335484800,2,875,4.509433962264151

5012452,1,B006PA0RMA,"I would honestly love to purchase this box set, but I can't. Viz media needs to incorporate more episodes per box set for a price of 30$. Anime listed for 30$ typically has 25-30 episodes instead of a mere 12-14 episodes per box set. I watch it online for free , but I rather pay for the box sets to support the industry. If viz wants more people to buy their box sets then they need to either do thwo things 1. add mor episodes to the box sets. or 2. make it blu ray. either solution would be reasonable because the price they are asking for isn't worth the quality we are getting",1335312000,4,581,4.105263157894737
5012453,5,B006PA0RMA,"After the incredible Immortals arc it was disappointing that the two boxsets that followed were filler (original content not adapted from the manga). Fans will be relieved to hear that this boxset, which contains episodes 113-126, is entirely canon material. This set contains 14 episodes in total, including the two ""bonus "" episodes: Kakashi chronicles. As with the previous Immortal arc, Naruto has a lot less screen time than one would expect from a show centered around him. This boxset is predominantly focused on Sasuke, who up to this point in Shippuden has barely been seen. It is a testament to Masashi Kishimitos excellent character devolpment, that the show can switch between narratives, whether it is Shikimaru, Sasuke, or Kakashi, and still be utterly engrossing to the viewer. The standout episodes in this boxset, however, have to be the eagerly anticipated: Kakashi chronicles. I won't spoil what happens in these episodes, but they are deeply emotional and fantastically done. What else is in this set? Well, an epic fight involving an akatski member, and a shocking twist. There is also the introduction of 3 New characters. Believe me when I say this: Naruto only gets better and better from here on.
IN SHORT:
Another superb set of 14 episodes. Highlights include Kakashi's past, an amazing akatski fight and the introduction of new characters. From here on the show/manga only gets more and more epic. Highly recommend.",1335139200,12,1442,5.114406779661017

This is a must for Naruto fans especially since DisneyXD isn't showing the for some reason which I don't understand. I would hav bought the DVD anyway. I love the characters that are in this set:Shino, Kiba, Kakashi,Kabuto...and especially Hinata and Naruto. I wish that Sasuke could have been featured less and the others more...but I'm not his biggest fan. I would like more of Naruto/Hinata and the rest. Itachi is so cool in this set also.

First of all, why is it that I have to wait nearly 45 days in between every boxset? I mean can't the time be less than that? Am not enjoying the story as it should be because of all the waiting. Is there any other way?

Another important thing, the packaging since boxset 5 is a single dvd case with 3 dvds inside?! Boxset 1 to 4 were nice slim dvd case for each dvd, every boxset has 3 dvds and I was paying $30 to $33 for those however, now am paying equivilant price (sometimes more) for a single dvd case!

He ends up fighting Deidera and that battle is pretty great - Deidre pushes him and this is the first time we have seen any type of real expression on Sasuke's face (surprise) since the original Naruto series. I'm not really a big fan or the small arcs that appear hear and there - like the Hotaru arc in set 12, but this is not one of the arc box's and continues the main story line.
