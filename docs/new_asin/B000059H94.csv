1405119,4,B000059H94,"I actually enjoyed this. Wood Harris did a good job in my opinion  in playing the hell out of James Marshall Hendrix. Anyone who has seen the documentary ""Jimi Hendrix"" or the (in)famous Dick Cavett interview could see that Harris has done his homework in captuning Hendrix's speech patterns and mannerisms. This is particularly true in the scene where Harris-as-Hendrix tries to explain what he is trying to do with his music to the Mike Jeffery and Chas Chandler (Jimi's managers) characters.
Much of what happens on screen here has appeared in the numerous bios of JMH.
Harris plays Hendrix as a confused but sympathetic person that all surviving accounts indicate that he was in real life.",1023753600,4,693,4.923076923076923
1405120,5,B000059H94,"The reason the soundtrack was bad was that the producers could not get the legal rights to the songs. They had to redo the songs, so they are not as good as you would want them to be.
Other than that this movie is great. Once you get used to seeing Wood Harris as Hendrix, and not the man himself, it is excellent. I definetly recomend this to everyone, ...",1019001600,2,357,4.114285714285714

Harris did portray Hendrix well, at least in comparison to documentary footage of the man.  As TV music biographies go, this is quite good. I gave it an extra 1/2 star, being a Hendrix fan.

Other negative reviews have detailed some of the problems, but what must be stressed here is the lack of quality music.
Hendrix was a great musician, but here you have a film about a musician whose music is not highlighted.  I particularly hated the way Wood Harris played Jimi.  Why the producers felt it most important to find someone that sort of looked like Hendrix regardless of talent I'll never know.  Harris' lack of talent was the reason for the MTV fast cut, mocumentry style camera work which is particularly annoying.
Bottom line: Poor soundtrack, poor acting, poor screenplay.  This film should never have been made.",998265600,,796,4.690647482014389
1405123,5,B000059H94,"I guess under the circumstances, in terms of Jimi's estate/liscensing, etc. the producer, director and actors did the best the could with what they had access too.  I thought that Wood Harris' interpretation was wonderful.  He brought out Jimi's sweet nature as well as his sexually free spirit.  I  would recommend this movie to those who don't know about Jimi. The supporting cast did a great job, especially Billy Zane and Viveca A. Fox.",992476800,5,440,4.905405405405405
1405124,2,B000059H94,"This made-for-cable movie is an honest attempt to boil down Jimi Hendrix's life and music down to less than two hours.  Unfortunately the producers were unable to obtain the rights to any of Jimi's songs, so the musical score is entirely made of up his covers (Hey Joe, All Along the Watchtower, Wild Thing, etc.) plus some unattributed jamming.  You get the typical 60s montages (JFK, Malcom X, the Beatles, Dylan, etc.) along with the cookie-cutter dialogue and vastly oversimplified story.
Despite some good performances, the script doesn't really offer the scope to examine why Hendrix's music was so revolutionary, or the problems that led to his early death.
There's not much fire here, either, as the film suffers from wooden pacing and is never especially absorbing.
The documentary film ""Jimi Hendrix"", also available on DVD, is a far better way to gain an appreciation of this artist.",986688000,23,894,5.033783783783784

1405159,4,B000059H94,"Really enjoyable watching this bio-pic, admittedly quite low budget (the live in concert scenes use audience stock footage) & the filmmakers didn't have permission to use any of Hendrix's self-penned songs, so instead they used old blue tracks & ""Wild Thing"" & ""Like a Rolling Stone"" (interesting that Dylan gave permission to use his material) & it does skip through his early life too fast, but the attention to detail is first class, & Wood Harris's portrayal of the purple-one is outstanding from start to finish.
Most of the film has quite a dark & sombre tone, dealing with Hendrix's frustration in not being able to evolve as an artist, but expected to keep on churning out the hits & constantly expected to tour so much he could never actually get in the studio.

  Billy Zane did Mike Jeffrey; difficult I would imagine, considering that he had nothing to reference. The character ""Jane "" was no doubt a composite and Devon Wilson had NO lines and wasn't even black!  Chas Chandler's part was believable.
  Wood Harris seemed to love Jimi and he has nice skills. Add it to your collection. The music is pretty good.

1405165,3,B000059H94,"First of all, I only started listening to Hendrix in 1971-72. I was too young to understand the impact that Hendrix and his music had on American Society. I would not really start to get into Hendrix until college 5-6 years later. Having said that, I think that the film had its good points and bad points. In my mind it was not exactly a well made, well thought out film about Jimi Hendrix. Then again, who has made a good movie about Hendrix, Jim Morrison, or Janis Joplin to name a few. You would think that Hollywood by now would have made a serious attempt to portray the lives of these and other important artists of that era other than motown or the Beatles and even then the really good films are few and far between. Nothing like Lady Sings the Blues or Bird. Interesting huh? Sure, it's not a good movie but on the other hand I give them an e for effort, that is to say at least they tried. Now it's time for a good director and screenwriter to make a serious attempt to portray this man's complicated life and powerful music.

FAST FORWARD...IT IS NOW 5/08, and i looked at this movie again after watching berkely, monterey, isle of wight, etc. and after viewing so much of the real thing, i can now see where they went wrong with the movie. for instance, the wording was all backwards when Harris tried to say what Hendrix really said ""I can say thank you, thank you, thank you,"" before he performed wild thing. nevertheless, Harris really  tried after all Hendrix was so unique & beautiful. I can imagine that it was difficult trying to play him. And this is the movie that made me so curious about the real man that I now have books and dvds all about his life. and i'm glad to know that Hendrix may have been vulnerable, but he was still a man and put ppl in their place when he needed to. his only fault was signin those contracts, but he wanted to get that outta the way so he could play his music. thats all he wanted.",1205366400,4,1470,4.15438596491228
1405194,1,B000059H94,"I can handle cheesy movies, and I don't expect to believe that someone can play Jimi perfectly, but this movie is pretty awful.  Wood Harris is a decent actor, but he obvioualy doesn't know much about playing guitar (neither do I, so it has to be pretty obvious to distract me).  He frequently speaks in a voice that is too high pitched and resorts to a huge cheesy grin far too often.  I respect the effort, but the result isn't enough to carry the movie.  Billy Zane should never do a British accent again (and I LIKE some Billy Zane movies - yeah, I know, I know).  After the music (see other reviews), the writing is probably the worst part of all.  So many details get glossed over, and then we see scenes that are much longer than necessary.  I was so excited to see this movie...and so disappointed.  Instead of being engrossed, I was constantly distracted.  I couldn't get past the Woodstock Star Spangled Banner scene (recreated very poorly).

1405195,5,B000059H94,I really enjoyed this movie. Wood Harris did the best job that he can do as far as playing the role of Jimi. I enjoyed both this and the 1973 biography release. This is a must have for any Jimi Hendrix fan.,1196467200,,206,3.9285714285714284
1405202,1,B000059H94,"I really thought this movie sucked, so much so that I couldn't watch the whole thing.  I have been a Hendrix fan for a long time, and he is my biggest influence and musical idol.  So naturally I was dissapointed when the actor playing Hendrix was not even playing the guitar; not to mention the studio musician they used for the guitar work was channeling texas blues, maybe SRV.  It didn't even sound like Hendrix.  And as has been mentioned, they didn't get the rights to any actual Hendrix songs, so the soundtrack didn't include any of Jimi's original music(how absurd is that?).

Personally the movie offended me; this movie is useless to anyone who already knows anything about Jimi.  And worse, to someone who does not know anything about Jimi, the movie portrays him as a corny goofball who stumbles into stardom.  I mean you can listen to the dialogue by the lead actor and you can tell which individual interviews he studied to prepare for the role; yet when he delivers these lines, he sounds like such a loser.  When Hendrix spoke, he was certainly a little out there sometimes, but he was cool.  He spoke the language of the 60's.  This actor definitely lost something in the translation.

I would recommend that you not see this movie; for the same price you could purchase something valuable, like the documentary ""Jimi Hendrix"" (1973?).  This actually has some really good clips of live concert footage.  Honestly, I would recommend that anyone who wants to learn more about Jimi should just buy as much of his music as you can afford and listen to it.  That is what Jimi Hendrix was about; creating revolutionary music.  If you want to get into the story of his life, which was quite sad, read a biography or something.

""Hendrix"" does not focus nearly enough on Jimi's music (clearly, they didn't get the rights to!) and instead tries to make a drama of his lifestory, and seems to do that very poorly too.  Zero Stars",1175126400,5,1936,4.6304985337243405

  Imagine making a film about Gene Kelly and giving the lead to someone who can't dance, BUT TRIES,........disgraceful.  I only hope the people responsible for this film were punished severly, Jimi deserves better.  I can see why the Hendrix estate refused the original music to the makers of this piece of garbage, they must have known it was doomed.

Anyone involved in the direction of this film should be banned from the universe, it really is that bad.  All the bad reviewers are right on.",1172707200,2,708,4.745901639344262

I was sick of his darting tongue and  his constant cheezy grinning during the concert scenes. The guitar playing "" simulation ""was even worse. The real Hendrix was not like this at all!!!.  I should have suspected the movie would suck, because no one can cheapen a film like Billy Zane.  Once I recognized him behind that huge mustache, I should have stopped watching.

I love late 60's rock.  I sat down to view this film as a light distraction . . . I WAS MESMERIZED!  Wood Harris is awesome as Jimi Hendrix.  Within the limitations on production (budget and licensing restrictions), this film was a great accomplishment.  It captures Jimi as incredibly talented, a ""free spirit"", and rather vulnerable.  It reveals how he fell into excesses of sex and drugs without demonizing him.  The music was great.  The music was not original Jimi Hendrix' recordings (duh), but they were very good and reasonably faithful variations.  The guitar work was great and Harris' on-stage portrayals did much credit to the originals.  The Monterey and Woodstock performances were excellent and entertaining copies of the originals.

Many facts are ignored/distorted/fabricated. Small things like accents are wrong: Chandler and Jeffery were both from Newcastle - I know that at least Chandler had a broad Newcastle accent. Hendrix mumbles and bumbles like he has a really low IQ. Hendrix's clothing is near perfect in the Monterey scene yet they get the guitar wrong - it was red and white in real life - why go to the trouble of detail in one area and leave it out in others.

Possibly the most damaging thing in the movie is the complete lack of an attempt to make it seem as if Wood can even mime the guitar parts. Gurning and poking the tongue doth not make a Hendrix impersonator. The jam with Cream is incredible - both guitarists parts are played by the same guitarist with the same guitar sound adn with just the merest hint of a difference in style - neither sounding like Clapton or Hendrix - no attempt is made here to show how bowled over everyone was - just chummy smiles all round.

It just gets worse - the discovery of Hendrix's death is innacurate and misleading.

1405209,1,B000059H94,"I have to agree with the some of the other reviewers of this movie, that it is a real stinker. And Wood Harris is not a bad actor, but in this movie he is given the impossible task of playing unarguably the best guitarist who ever lived. Jimi was one of a kind and I doubt that we will ever in our life times see another such original or innovative musician. So from the beginning, the movie is a failure in attempting to achieve something that should have never even been attempted.

And yes, the music is horrible; not even close to the beauty and passion that Jimi created. It also sort of plays fast and loose with the some of the facts of Jimi's life and does not really make the viewer understand what demons he was fighting at the end, which I believe would have made the movie so much better.

I read somwhere last year, that the Hughes Brothers were thinking about making a movie about Jimi. Well they should watch this movie and then do the exact opposite. But I really believe that it would be almost impossible to make a movie about Jimi that would be true to his life and what he stood for, and one that his fans would accept.

So I agree with some of my fellow reviewers, don't waste your money. If you want to know about Jimi and his music read ELECTRIC GYPSY or JIMI HENDRIX: MUSICIAN or Sharon Lawrence's book. And if you want to see him playing as only he could, watch Monterey Pop, Woodstock, Jimi Plays Berkley or even Band of Gypsys.",1119398400,,1454,4.28

Wood Harris is not a bad actor; quite the antithesis. He made a heroic effort to portray a man whose persona, mannerisms, and ""vibe"" simply cannot be imitated. Kudos to Mr. Harris for his bravery. His biggest mistakes were 1. to listen to the director and turn his character into a mumbling buffoon, and 2. Wood made NO EFFORT to learn anything about how to play the guitar. While making the movie ""Crossroads"", Ralph Macchio actually took guitar lessons, so he would look like a guitar player. Wood's hands moved clumsily and uncertainly; and were always out of sync with the music. This was a mistake that doubtless will plague him forever.

The director did a mediocre job bringing life to a badly written script. Granted, Hendrix' story had a great deal of tragedy; but I have it on good authority that Hendrix was also a lot of fun to be around.

The scene that described his death was not historically accurate. I know people who were personally acquainted with Hendrix and were around when he died: and they told me what REALLY happened that day.

The cinematography was trying to hard to be ""hip"" by modern standards; and at the same time create illusions of environments the production clearly hadn't the skill to create. This was especially noticeable during the concert scenes. The sound was poorly done and failed to recreate the acoustic environment of a concert hall.

The music was marred by the fact that nobody can play the guitar like Hendrix without sounding like someone trying to imitate him, and Hendrix' estate refused to allow them to use any of his original compositions. In fact, the music was quite pathetic. Whoever was playing guitar on the soundtrack is clearly a hack.

The glossing over of the music; which was Hendrix' greatest accomplishment, was truly irritating. All it was was sensationalism and Hollywood glamor: all flash and no substance - which does a great disservice to Hendrix' legacy, musical genius, and life.

The whole thing made me sick.",1102896000,5,2016,4.809248554913295

Its not an entertaining view by any stretch of the imagination and the flaws, of which there are many, are glaring and so egregious they spoil the movie.  I'll touch on a couple of the most criminal.  First off the actor playing Hendrix simply does not have the acting skills or physical resemblance to make a believable Hendrix.  He's not a horrible actor, just in no way convincing as Jimi.  Perhaps they should have cast somebody who had even a remote clue as how to play a guitar.  Likewise the guys playing Noel and Mitch are in no way convincing.  In fact that criticism holds true for everyone in the movie except perhaps for Billy Zanes' portrayal of Mike Jeffrey.  Many of the character portrayals are at best laughable.  Second and most importantly NONE of the music in the film was written or played by Hendrix.  Since the filmakers couldn't get the rights to Hendrix's music they could use only those songs Jimi covered, such as Hey Joe and they couldn't use Hendrix's performances either.  Instead they used some studio band to play the covers and bad Hendrix-like songs/jams instead.  I'm sorry but watching the actors badly pretend to play BAD Hendrix-like songs performed by some studio hacks creates more pain than should be inflicted on any movie goer.

1405222,1,B000059H94,"Hmmm... Where to start?
Wood Harris isn't really that terrible of an actor. (Although I've only see him in one movie.) This has to be one of the most challenging roles for any actor. Wood, however, plays Hendrix as if he was a mumbling airhead. The filmmakers also needed to get an actor who could actually play guitar. He didn't have to necessarily be good, just know enough to fake it. (Hendrix is one of the best guitarists in history, so it's okay if you can't play like him.) Also, this film, being a TV-movie, had a limited budget. The Woodstock scene was painful to watch, especially when it appeared as if Hendrix was only playing in front of a crowd of 10 extras. The costumes were great, but the hairpieces really needed some work.
The biggest disappointment was the music. Since, the filmmakers were unable to license Hendrix's music, we get some really bad cover tunes with a singer that doesn't even sound like him. It should have been a sign that his movie should have never been made.",1090108800,6,999,4.555555555555555

1405224,3,B000059H94,"""Hendrix"" isn't exactly a top-notch movie, in fact, in many ways it's a real dud.  However, it is a movie that is indeed worth seeing at least once if you're a Jimi Hendrix fan.  Admittedly there are many problems with it, and while it has some positive aspects it's not easy to overlook the downsides.
First and foremost the movie very hastily covers Hendrix's early years, most notably his childhood, which should have been focused on more.  His cold relationship with his mother is hardly established, aside from a brief scene between the two.  Another important part of Jimi's life, his tenure in the U.S. Army as a Paratrooper is very hastily done and is quite dissapointing.  While it's entertaining to see Jimi outplay Little Richard and then get booted off the tour for doing so, it's incorrect, I won't bore you with facts, but it's something to keep in mind.  Jimi's time as a studio musician is only mentioned by Jimi himself during one or two scenes, and that's about it.
Now I can overlook those facts, but the thing that dissapoints me the most is how they handled The Experience.  Bassist Noel Redding, while with some short and so-so scenes, is hardly paid any mind to, and even less for drummer Mitch Mitchell.  They fail to truely give Hendrix's band mates credit, nor do they do justice to the charisma between the three.  Hendrix's time after The Experience with The Band of Gyspys is served even less time, another important fact to Jimi's career brushed aside.
Another flaw are the ""musicians"" themselves...they aren't even playing the instruments or making any attempt to make it look like they are for that matter.  During several drum rolls Mitch Mitchell sits there and hits one cymbal, it looks quite ridiculous to say the least.  Even Hendrix himself looks like he's just an amature who walked into a guitar shop, plucking the strings.  Last, but not least, is the movie uses no actualy Hendrix recordings, calling upon studio musicians to try and mock Hendrix, as many reviewers have mentioned before, the National Anthem at Woodstock is almost painful to listen to.
So why see this movie just once? To be honest, while I took issue with all of these negative facts, I still enjoyed it to a degree.  Wood Harris, who plays Hendrix, does a fairly good job of capturing Jimi, though this is almost impossible to do.  The dialogue between Hendrix and others is entertaining with some unrealistic yet memorable lines.  I was glad that Hendrix's conflict between appealing to a mainstream white audience and appealing to his black roots was shown during a conversation with two Black Panther representatives.
If you're a Hendrix fan, be prepared for this movie to have it's flaws, but don't dwell on them, see it at least once for the positive aspects, not the negatives.  As for the three men who wrote this, if you plan to write a more in depth sequel of sorts, do it right this time.  A movie about Jimi Hendrix needs time to establish his life, his career and his downfall, even if it meant a three hour film, I don't know of one Hendrix fan who wouldn't enjoy every minute of it.",1086393600,2,3108,4.694290976058932
1405225,1,B000059H94,"This was a really lousy movie, and a really lousy interpretation of Jimi's life. This is a good example of movie companies trying to make money by hitting a target audience with a very shallow product. The dude they had playing Eric Clapton made me laugh, He looks like Neo from ""The Matrix"" without the funny glasses.
Basically, the music sucked, the acting was bad, there were huge gaps in the story (whatever happened to Jimi's military service?), and there was a sex scene thrown in just to attract people with dirty minds.",1083283200,2,527,4.67741935483871
1405226,1,B000059H94,I am a huge classic rock fan I listen to all the classic rock bands an example of that is Jimi Hendrix. I have every CD and DVD of Hendrix I study this guy I love this guy. I went to Giant Eagle to rent some movies one day and I saw this one titled HENDRIX. I was excited to see what it had in store for me latter I found out it had nothing in store for me. This movie is the worst movie you could possibly watch this movie just brings HENDRIX down 100% its an insult the way they casted the actor who was supposed to be Jimi Hendrix. This whole movie brings the wrong example of how Jimi Hendrix got started alot of it is made up. Ya I understand they could not have the orginal rights to the Hendrix songs for the movie so they had a band play Hendrix  but boy the band sucked>>it just maded this DVD go further down hill wow. If you never heard of Jimi Hendrix and want to buy this then don't because you will get lead on the wrong way. In the future I am sure they will come out with a better movie of Jimi Hendrix the cast will be better so will the music. The actors in this movie sucked this movie is as worst as it can get. You can believe me or not on this but im telling my 100% truth don't buy this. I do have something you may want to look into of buying Jimi Hendrix to get started on DVD buy Experience Hendrix you will love it. p.s. check out my other reviews!,1072828800,2,1375,3.875886524822695
1405227,1,B000059H94,"If the original Jimi Hendrix Experience were put together as poorly as this movie, he wouldn't have had nearly the notoriety that he did during his lifetime.
To say this movie is a poor representation of Jimi is an understatement.  This movie presents Jimi as a bumbling, babbling boob!  Jimi was an intelligent, articulate man who was quite existentialistic and philosophical in his thinking.
Take the scenes where they replicate his classic 1967 Monterey Pop performance.  Jimi speaks to the crowd between tunes, at times laughing and making comments in a loose and relaxed manner.  On this movie, Jimi is presented literally stammering unintelligibly, making almost no sense, and coming across as a total embarrassment.  For the true Hendrix fan, it's very disappointing to watch.
The only positive thing I will say is the wardrobe was very well replicated.  The clothes Jimi wears were well researched.
Faithful and realistic to Jimi's life and the way he performed, absolutely not!  No one can ACT Jimi on stage.  Jimi was a total original, one of a kind, never to be repeated.  The makers of this movie would have been better off splicing the original footage.  As it is, this movie never uses the original soundtrack for scenes such as the Woodstock Festival, probably because they weren't able to get the rights to do so.  So, what you have here is an actor playing Jimi and some studio guitarist trying to play in the style of Jimi.  The Star Spangled Banner becomes the Star Mangled Banner.  The performances are far inferior to the original and sure to turn-off young, prospective fans.
Steer clear of this movie; don't waste your money.  It's a Stinker with a capital S!  Take your money and buy one of the true Jimi DVDs or videos that are on sale at Amazon.  You'll get the man and his music and be a lot happier than if you waste it on this movie.",1064880000,5,1862,4.718266253869969
1405228,2,B000059H94,Jimi was Jimi not Hendrix that they chose to call the movie by his last name should have been a tip off that they didn't love him like we did. The best guitarist there ever was. Rock on.,1051142400,,186,3.9210526315789473
1405229,1,B000059H94,"Lets face it, any movie made about Hendrix would have been difficult to portray; you cant match his mind. Even though Wood Harris did the best job anybody probably could have done (even though ""they"" did make Jimi seem like a mindless ""doots""). But in all fairness it probably wasn't Harris's decision anyway. I enjoyed the visual recreation of Monterey and Woodstock, and the character look alikes in Jimi's life. The film also sensationalized his drug use and sex life  (FOR WHAT!!!).  I would have given the film TWO stars if they had omitted that alone! They portrayed his death as a ""drug overdose"" which I think was an insult to his legacy. If anyone wants to really find out about Hendrix, buy an authorized autobiography. ( Jimi Hendrix, Electric Gypsy by Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek is a good one!)
To quote Billy Cox: ""Jimi Hendix was a true natural, a genius, and one of the greatest musicians that ever lived"". Let that be his epitaph.
For those who don't know, check out the discs, ""Band Of Gypsys"", ""Live At The Fillmore East"", "" The Baggy Rehersal Sessions"", ""Blues"", ""Electric Ladyland"" or this new DVD ""Wild Blue Angel"" to see (or hear) Hendrix the musician, rather than the sensationalized stoned aloof rock star this film portrays.
I would also like to mention people in Jimi's life that contributed to the music: Billy Cox, Eddie Kramer, Buddy Miles, Mitch Mitchell, and Noel Redding. Your contributions are not forgotten.
Peace to all.",1042848000,,1462,4.820717131474104
1405230,2,B000059H94,"Here are the flaws with this movie, they failed to detail his stints with the dixie circuit, his time in the army, his wild times during the european tours, fights within the band, his excessive drug taking, and the making of his 3 great albums (Are you experienced, Bold as Love, and Electric lady land). This movie only focused on his financial and creative disputes with Jeffrey Leonard. This movie could have given the mainstream exposure to a lot of his great songs that did not get radio play but, instead of forced fed us his generic radio hits such as purple haze, watchtower, like a rolling stone, or Hey Joe. I guess it didn't occur to this film staff to enlighten the public instead of rehashing old history that the average joe would know of.
This movie was clearly done by a a bad director who did little research on Hendrix's life but, only chose to focus on the news clippings instead of the more obscure aspects of his life which would have made this movie more interesting.
Oliver Stone should have made this movie and only he can bring a true perspective on who Hendrix really was.",1040947200,4,1099,4.527638190954774

This is a Hollywood biography about James Hendrix, the guitar player in the late 1960s who became famous for his new style of music. He had served in the Army paratroopers (82nd Airborne) until an injury forced him out. He was born in Seattle WA and began playing as a young boy. Jimmy played guitar in a Little Richard show. He won an Apollo amateur contest. He played at small smoke-filled clubs. He played for Caf Wha? in the Village, then formed a new group and played his electric guitar. Can he sing too? Is his voice good enough? Yes. He is offered an opportunity in London. One shot with Cream, his music idols. The audience applauds. There is a name change.

Hendrix lists his musical heroes, from Bach to Dylan, etc. He sings Hey Joe (a hit for another band around 1960). [Could this song be played on todays radio stations?] He meets an admirer inside, outside he meets an investor. [What is this?] They need a song to last 2:52 for airplay. He goes to the Monterey Pop Festival, other big groups will be there (June 1967). The Who performs. He plays Wild Thing in his style, then uses lighter fluid. [Light my fire?] The audience applauds. [Is this music or gimmicks?] Purple Haze is a big hit. The Monkees were a top group. A concert promoter meets him and proposes a tour - 60 cities in 66 days (to rake in the dough). Jimi sings Like a Rolling Stone. They must tour to raise money for their high costs, but this tires the performers. [Touring has its dangers, as with stars that fell.] It is business. Famous and happy are two different things.

Things have changed. One group sings about Black Power. April 1967 brings changes to the nation. Jimi performs in 1968 Newark NJ to benefit a fund. Jimi wants new sounds for his act. Chaz leaves for his new life. They record another Dylan song. Jimi has complaints about the musicians. [Symbol of his unease?] There is a lot of time put into a 3 minute recording. Jimi reminisces about the past. Was something planted in his luggage? Hell need a good lawyer. Jimi played at the Woodstock Festive in August 1969. That music came from an old drinking song, To Anacreon in Heaven but caused a controversy.

They show scenes from other events from that era. He is on trial in Canada and testifies; not guilty. He makes his guitar perform. A trumpet is added, but this new sound isn't salable. Jimi tells about his beliefs and hopes. This is business says Michael. In 1970 his group is the Band of Gypsies. [Does his drug use affect his talents?] Chaz visits him in September 1970. His contract with Michael will soon be over. Will things come to an end? Emergency Services answer a call from a woman. I found him. Overdose of barbituates is the coroners verdict. Drugs seem to be the occupational disease of actors and musicians.

Or were their deaths more than a coincidence (Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison)? This is a good story but seems less than great. Was that the original music? Does it warn against recreational drug use? Does the stress of performance of actors and musicians create a need for drinks and drugs? But others share this need, so is it oppression or unhappiness? Does emotion triumph over reason for most people?",1436140800,,3208,4.5625
