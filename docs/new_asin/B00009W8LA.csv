1893857,5,B00009W8LA,"My oldest son started watching Dave videos (starting with There Goes an Airplane) when he was 2 years old and still loves them at 5.  I recently bought a firefighter video from another ""non-Dave"" series and after viewing it once I went right online and ordered the Dave Rescue Hero DVD because the other firefighter video was awful.

Dave has a charming and entertaining delivery and doesn't come across as ""talking down"" to kids at all like some other people who make kids videos.  My boys would probably watch the Dave videos all day every day if I let them.  If your kids love planes, helicopters, bulldozers, and firetrucks I guarantee they will love the Dave series!",1097280000,8,671,4.7094017094017095
1893858,5,B00009W8LA,"Our family enjoys these Dave Hood productions, and this dvd is no exception.  There are three programs here:  There Goes a Rescue Hero, in which Dave learns about the many careers that help in emergency situations; There Goes a Police Car, with Dave and Becky discovering how the police do their job; and There Goes a Rescue Vehicle, where Dave and Becky ride in ambulances, helicopters and other rescue vehicles.
Special features include a bloopers reel, two songs, definitions and an interactive dispatch center, where kids choose between two alternatives in a picture quiz.
Lots of fun!",1077753600,13,589,5.061855670103093
1893859,5,B00009W8LA,"This video is part of the ""Real Wheels"" series. In this episode, follow soldier Dave and his dog Charlie while they visit with all types of rescue professionals -- real life search and rescue heroes such as the Coast Guard, Fire Fighters, Paramedics, Lifeguards, and even Disaster Search & Rescue dogs! Kids will learn how these real-life professionals rescue others and will also learn about the special equipment they use.

Also included is real-life footage of past rescues! Dave even gets to join in a fire-fighting training exercise!

We recommend this video -- Dave is a likeable character, and his goofiness makes this series fun to watch! Aside from being entertaining, children will find themselves learning quite a bit about rescue heroes and the jobs they do.",1069200000,,770,5.05511811023622

1893861,5,B00009W8LA,"I was so excited to hear that this series came out with two more wonderful DVD's!  My 3 year son is a huge fan of these DVD's so I immediately bought both (Mega Truck Adventures)!  My son goes crazy for anything and everything about Rescue Trucks and Rescue Heroes.  Even my husband stares at the TV watching the DVD's with our son because he loves the trucks and the people involved as much as our little guy does.  The DVD is also packed with awesome special features.  We especially love the bloopers because my son thinks the host, Dave, is great!  I would recommend this series to anyone with kids who adore learning and having fun at the same time!",1064966400,3,654,4.408333333333333
1893862,5,B00009W8LA,"My little boy (2years old) is obsessed with this video.  It is silly and focuses on his favorite things, fire trucks and the like.  We use it as a reward for good behavior (If you do X you can watch Rescue Hero).",1215475200,,212,4.023809523809524
1893863,5,B00009W8LA,"My 3 year old absolutely loves this series.  ""Dave""  is very entertaining and informative.  I would recommend this to anyone.  He would view them repetitively if I would allow it. Great gift!",1200355200,,191,4.875
1893864,3,B00009W8LA,"I realize that many enjoy ""slapstick"" style humor, but it's not necessary to emphasize the ""silliness"" factor to teach children about the fascinating world around them or to alleviate possible fears that children may have with such serious topics.

In these episodes, children learn about real life dangers and the rescue workers who are always on call, but the level of antics by the actors distracts somewhat from the safety messages; many children will be more enthralled by those antics to recall the real life-saving warnings and messages about rescue workers.  I suggest heading over to your local rescue workers open house or a safety fair rather than viewing these videos repeatedly.  One positive aside is that the actors involved do offer a serious note at the end explaining how dangerous some of the things can be and they explain what can happen ""in real life"" throughout the episodes.

The Little Mammoth series of DVD's and videos are much more suitable and do not involve such over-the-top nonsense.",1181088000,,1015,5.023809523809524
1893865,5,B00009W8LA,"The makers of Real Wheels have done a commendable job of providing educational information, while keeping the DVD entertaining as well. This is one DVD that my son frequently requests to be popped into the player so he can enjoy repeated viewings (but he likes to play with his car collection at the same time). I must admit that I enjoy it everytime too.",1168128000,,355,4.5625
1893866,5,B00009W8LA,"This is a great video. What makes it great is a combination of things.

First it is about rescue heroes. It provides young children with heroes and positive role models. Second it shows a variety of people doing a variety of jobs. It has a lady ambulance driver for example. Third, it covers all types of rescue people from life guards to police to fire men and so on. Fourth, it is educational but it is also funny.

My young son who is two loves trucks and this is a favorite of his. But my other children a girl age 5 and a boy age 7 also enjoy these videos.

Worth the money.",1151798400,,579,4.106194690265487
1893867,5,B00009W8LA,"I am such a huge fan of Dave Hood, who is the creator of these series and he did such a good job on these other videos before the others which look good although some of them I have never seen. There Goes A Rescue Hero might also be previous refrences to There Goes A Fire Truck and There Goes A Rescue Vehicle.",1137369600,2,311,3.9523809523809526
1893868,5,B00009W8LA,Our 3 year old LOVES this dvd! He is addicted to it. It's so great-characters talk to the kids on their level and make it fun without being dumb. I want to see other ones in this series!,1125187200,,186,3.9210526315789473
1893869,5,B00009W8LA,"I recommend this DVD to anyone who has a child between the ages of 2 and 9. What child doesn't dream of becoming a firefighter or police officer?  I thought this was a great way to show my child some insight while still having fun!  Includes entertaining and informative presentations of the police, firefighters, first-aid, etc doing what they do best.  I really appreciate this live action presentation compared to a cartoon or animated description of these intriguing jobs.  What a wonderful treat for any child to have fun and also learn the importance of safety in their community.",1123372800,4,586,4.888888888888889
1893870,5,B00009W8LA,"I bought this dvd for my son for his 4th birthday and he absolutely loves it!  The combo of educational info and Dave's comedy and physical falls and gags is perfect for age 3 to 7 (although a friend of my son's who is 9 watched it with him and was really entertained as well).  The best part about Dave's ""There Goes a..."" series is the fact that he writes them in a way that includes girls (including a female partner) and holds their interest as well - all the 3 and 4 yr old girls who are friends with my son love it.  This makes a GREAT gift for that preschooler who you don't know what to get!",1107129600,2,599,4.016806722689076

7993616,5,B00009W8LA,"This video which consists of 3 different episodes (fire-rescue, police, rescue hero) is the best money I have spent on a fire-truck related DVD in a very long time. The video's are EXCELLENT. Perfect for my 3 1/2 year old. They are informative, while at the same time hilarious. I myself got a kick out of watching them. The actor is amazing and I hope he is stil around and makes more of these types of videos. Seriously....I am rarely impressed with public safety DVD's geared towards toddlers, but this one is absolutely awesome. I cannot recommend it enough !",1370822400,,563,4.64
