2992507,5,B000WVPXBS,"This is a great video to learn belly dance moves and work up to put these moves together into a routine. Dolphina makes the moves easy to understand and follow, and you can go at your own pace if you don't master these moves right away. The video is separated into different sections, such as abs, upper body, and Cardio 1 and 2, then routine. I highly recommend this DVD to learn belly dance and plus it's a fun workout.",1203206400,5,421,4.275
2992508,5,B000WVPXBS,"I have enjoyed The Goddess Workout very much.  It is so nice to dance and excerise at the same time.  It is very easy to understand and exerise to.
I would recomend it to anyone who would like to purchase and use the CD",1202947200,,219,3.9545454545454546
2992509,5,B000WVPXBS,"Dolphina has put out another great belly dance instructional DVD.
She is interesting and motivational in her teaching! This is a great
DVD for anyone who has a basic understanding of belly dance. It is
not an advanced workout and provides good basic technique and move-
ment. The music and setting on this DVD is very appealing and nice
and offers a pleasant atmosphere to follow along with.
Im not a profesional belly dancer but I have been doing belly dance
isolations and movements for years as my main means of fitness. I
enjoy a vast array of teaching DVDs but I always highly enjoy the
Dolphina experience!!! Excellent workout if you are not a perfect-
ionist and have a light heart that wants to have fun and be inspired!
Dolphina is wonderful for those looking to go beyond their daily
routines in search of the magic that exists in the mystical world
of belly dance!!!!",1202947200,2,878,4.634615384615385
2992510,5,B000WVPXBS,"This dvd provides all the basic bellydance moves to get a great cardio workout! The first 3 sections break down the bellydance isolations so even if you are completely new to bellydance, you can learn. These sections help me to tone and sculpt my muscles and refined these movements. Each of these segments slowly build on themselves so that they get your heart rate going. Then the dvd goes into the shimmies, which is such a great cardio workout on its own and then 2 long cardio bellydance combination segments and then a routine. I find it an easy and enjoyable workout. I love all the uplifting comments from dolphina and feel my attitude is always adjusted to feeling uplifted by the end of the workout. I highly recommend this dvd to bellydancers, dance fitness lovers and those who haven't exercised in a long time!",1202688000,15,823,4.682758620689655
2992511,5,B000WVPXBS,Dolphina is the most inspirational belly dance teacher out there. Her mission statement is to empower women through dance and she's doing it! This dvd was a great workout and I learned a lot about belly dance. Dolphina is a joy to learn from--always positive and fun. The best way to exercise! With Dolphina!,1202515200,4,308,4.722222222222222
2992512,4,B000WVPXBS,"I really like how this workout  makes my abs feel. From the beginning, Dolphina instructs and teaches you how to effectively use your abs, and if you continue to use her tips throughout the video you get an amazing ab work out.

With that being said, Dolphina will be hit or miss for you. She says very cheesy uplifting things like ""If you can't do it, don't worry, every day is different"" that you will either love or hate. She seems very genuine and her instruction is very clear.

The cardio portions are only cardio portions if you use the ab techniques she demonstrated. This is a good workout for a low-key cardio with a lot of emphasis on the obliques.

Try it out, and see if you like it/her. I really like the pace of it and the amazing ab work.",1325635200,3,754,4.288732394366197
2992513,4,B000WVPXBS,I own at least four instructional belly dance DVDs and this one is by far the easiest to successfully follow. Each move is broken down into well explained and demonstrated steps so you really understand the entire movement. Some DVDs I have purchased are obviously geared for those with a dance background and are way too complicated and quick paced in their instructional method. You end up never mastering the move. This one is for the novice who needs to hear it in plain English. Could use a bit more cardio segments but overall well rounded.,1316390400,,546,4.697916666666667
2992514,4,B000WVPXBS,I have an older DVD from Dolphina and I like this one better because she shows you how to do the moves more slowly so beginners can catch on. Also love her positive attitude towards women of all sizes. My two teenage daughters will join in with me and we all have fun!,1310515200,2,268,4.0754716981132075
2992515,5,B000WVPXBS,"This product was shipped in excellent condition and on time, I was really pleased with the service.
This is a great DVD for beginners belly dance or middle eastern dance, as seen on TV. Dolphina breaks down the steps for beginners easily. It's great to follow for keeping fit as well as for having lots of fun!!! You'll enjoy.",1309996800,,326,4.5423728813559325
2992516,4,B000WVPXBS,"As someone who is just starting to workout regularly and who is also completely new to BellyDance, I found this DVD to be great! It's easy enough to where you don't get lost, but also challenging enough to get your muscles burning! The only complaint I had was that it was a little slow here and there, but over all I would give it a 4/5! I also really like Dolphina's attitude. Very uplifting!",1280966400,2,394,4.337837837837838

2992518,1,B000WVPXBS,"She's definitely got an upbeat attitude, not annoying though. I didn't find that I go a work out at all with this video.  I didn't even sweat. I got bored with the repetition. I really wanted to learn belly dance - I don't think this is the way to go.",1268006400,,251,4.02
2992519,4,B000WVPXBS,this is a different type of workout than her usual DVD's but the music is great and you learn some new moves........otherwise a great refresher DVD.,1264809600,,148,4.730769230769231
2992520,3,B000WVPXBS,"I have Dolphina's old bellydance Introduction & Warrior (I never tried the zills or veil) & enjoyed it. It was one of my first beside Neena & Veena (the Belly twins) when I'd done those so much I knew them by heart too much. Dolphina was was more friendly & relaxed, like working out w/a girlfriend, though not as good a dancer, but not bad, her form is a little sloppy, though she is fluid and definitely angles on the sensual aspect. She kept you moving while teaching, she did half time a lot, though her explanation could have been better. She has the Goddess angle which was different, it's suppose to encourage self-esteem, but sometimes she can take it too far into corny/lame trying too hard.
In this one, she keeps to the same formula, the only difference is the set is more basic & her tan is deeper. She teaches while demonstrating, not a voice over. Some of her comments got to me like when doing the milkshake, she says, ""Next time you're in an argument, do the milkshake & see what happens."" Umm, if it's a boyfriend/husband, it's a manipulative way to win an argument & start s*x. If it's a woman, shocked expression & punched? If it's a male stranger, raped??? She should keep to general or spiritual encouragement & then also just relax & be like a girlfriend, not try to be some fake guru who gives bad advice.
During the program, every chapter starts w/a fade in/out of TEN - FOURTEEN seconds of white nothingness, then her stomach moving in slow motion w/the title. WAY too long.
--Workout--
Intro: (2 min)
Warm-up: (6 min) she uses snake arms, mayas (vertical figure 8s), horizontal figure 8s, etc. w/o teaching at all.
Hips, Buns Thighs: (7 min) hip lifts, hip drops, pelvic drops (she calls good & plenty, but she uses her upper abs too much so looks more like club style stomach tucks)
Abs 1: (4 min) camel & traveling camel
Abs 2: (5 min) internal vertical figure 8s (she calls snake hips), traveling w/IV figure 8s
Upper Body: (5 min) snake arms, snake arms in genie position & both arms fwd position, wrist circles
Shimmy: (2 min) basic shimmy (tells you to squeeze gluts & use knees), very fast omni (small hip circles) she calls milkshakes. she barely teaches how to do a hip circle before speeding it up unlike the previous teaching.
The above all has 1/2 time instruction & full tempo practice before moving on.
Cardio: (5 min) Full tempo w/a very fast/furious drum/cymbal beat w/her just calling out the moves. snake arms, shimmy, camel & traveling camel, pelvic drops, genie arms, etc.
Cardio 2: (5 min) Here is a good tempo Middle Eastern beat, Dolphina here tells you how to move your body & hints that you are stringing this practice into a routine. She also adds pelvic drop to a camel but still calls it good & plenty.
Routine (3 min): She calls out the moves as you do the routine. A bit bland & repetitious.
Cool Down: (90 seconds) hip lifts, slow shimmy & wide hip circles

Bonus:
Performance by Dolphina - quick, with a lot of pausing, way zoomed in angles, etc. so you can barely see any moves/style.
How to create a bellydance costume - (4 min) How dolphina has them in almost every color, to make sure you use bracelets, anklets, toe rings, belly chain, belly jewel, etc., accessories. How she got inspired for some costumes by shells at the beach, metal tassel, etc., and she used to spend 6 months doing beading, but now uses a professional seamstress.

This is good for bellydance beginners only & those who don't workout regularly. It's good on it's own, but considering not many moves are taught & more are taught on her Intro & Advanced Warrior previous workouts years ago, I'd suggest those workouts, or renting this at netflix first.

2992521,5,B000WVPXBS,"Dolphina may become your body best friend because you'll love your body with this dvd. I would say this is cardio.
Dolphina voice and smile are so nice. I like also the music wich isn't toomuch bellydance style.",1244332800,2,211,4.578947368421052
2992522,1,B000WVPXBS,"- I recently bought ""The Goddess Workout: Intro to Bellydance"" from a local store. The DVD had a problem with the sound, so I returned it and bought this DVD ""The Goddess Workout: Cardio Bellydance"" on Amazon.com. I decided not to re-purchase the ""Intro"" DVD because the camera angles didn't always show the moves, and because Dolphina, the host, was a bit annoying. I saw so many more positive reviews for ""Cardio"" that I bought it instead.
- BIG MISTAKE! The camera angles are a little better in this one, but Dolphina is sooooo much more annoying! She has this airy, lispy voice that makes her sound like a stereotypical ""dumb blond"". She keeps saying stupid phrases like, ""your a goddess"", ""you can't change everything about yourself, but you can change some things"", ""don't worry about it, your a goddess"", and did I mention ""your a goddess"". All of this is done with a fake, bleached smile plastered to her face.
- But the cherry on top of this disastrous sundae is that she doesn't even dance with the music! I couldn't believe that a dance instructor, who is doing simple side-to-side movements couldn't move with the 1-2-3 beat of a drum. It's pathetic. She does things like saying ""let's do 5 more"", but does seven more while counting to four.
- I could go on and on about miscellaneous other things like random hand twitches (not artistic or lyrical, just random), and long, pointless musical interludes between sections, but I won't waste any more of your time. I just hope you don't waste your time, and money, by buying this DVD.",1236124800,7,1543,4.676470588235294
2992523,5,B000WVPXBS,"Loved dolphina's latest video!

2992524,5,B000WVPXBS,"This is a great DVD that is easy to follow and is actually fun! Actually you do work up a sweat if you do as instructed and my heart rate was increased about 40-45% during the last half of the video. She made me laugh so hard when she mentions that 'isn't it great that you have a body and you can shake it?'--throughout the video you hear some funny things Dolphina says that you can't help but laugh! This is definately a fun alternative to boring exercise, I can't wait to use what I have learned on an audience--my hubby in particualr, lol.

2992525,5,B000WVPXBS,"I LOVED this video: the music is great, Dolphina is a good teacher, and the dance moves are fun.  I was so sore after my first run-through!!  This video is a great beginner belly dance video and just about anyone can do it.  Dolphina is not intimidating and she keep repeating positive affirmations about our bodies.  It's very refreshing to see someone on an exercise video telling you to love your body at all stages of life!",1218240000,2,427,4.5064935064935066
2992526,4,B000WVPXBS,A great companion to the Intro to Bellydance video.  I did this workout with a friend who has not done any bellydance before and she was able to follow along with Dolphina's instructions without any problem.,1217548800,,207,4.75
2992527,5,B000WVPXBS,This is a good DVD for workout and fun. You can choose your own workout in each day from the DVD session.,1212624000,,105,3.8181818181818183
2992528,5,B000WVPXBS,I have Doplhina's whole collection of DVD's and this is by far my favorite! Once you have the basics down from the beginner bellydance video you are able to reach your full speed and flow with a great 1 hour workout. I wish there were not such long pauses between each section..but thats her style I guess. I am part of a bellydanc club and we get together and do this DVD almost every week!!!!,1208649600,3,394,4.266666666666667
2992529,5,B000WVPXBS,"I have a few bellydance workout DVDs...but I have to say, I am very pleased with Dolphina's teaching style!  She really breaks each move down step by step.

2992530,5,B000WVPXBS,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this new video from Dolphina.  It actually did get my heart rate up, which is more than I can say from some of the other videos out there.  The thing to remember is that Dolphina's videos are ""workout videos"" and not authentic bellydance instruction.  Keep that in mind and you should be able to enjoy it.  I do wish she had not called one of the steps ""milkshake"" though.  It made me think of the song by the same name (brings boys to the curve).  Gag.  Also, if you want more workout..you may wish to add a weight belt from [..]",1203552000,8,576,4.181818181818182
2992531,1,B000WVPXBS,"How they can call this video ""cardio"" is beyond me ... the pace is so slow you'll never get your heart rate up, and you'll never break a sweat. You could sleep walk through all the moves in the entire video, that's how lame it is. This is not exercise at all. :(

If you are a total beginner to belly dance and want a slow, well demonstrated view of belly dance moves, this could be good to start with for you.
Once you have the basic moves (typically, after 3-5 viewings of this DVD), go to Dolphina's ""Basics of Bellydance"". or just save time and money and start with that DVD to begin with. it's a much better workout then this, and you won't grow out of it in a week.

If you have mastered the basics of belly dance and are looking for a more challenging way to dance away the pounds, stay clear of this DVD. Instead got with Dolphina's earlier ""warrior goddess"" workout.",1203379200,15,875,4.233532934131737

--Workout--
Intro: (2 min)
Warm-up: (6 min) she uses snake arms, mayas (vertical figure 8s), horizontal figure 8s, etc. w/o teaching at all.
Hips, Buns Thighs: (7 min) hip lifts, hip drops, pelvic drops (she calls good & plenty, but she uses her upper abs too much so looks more like club style stomach tucks)
Abs 1: (4 min) camel & traveling camel
Abs 2: (5 min) internal vertical figure 8s (she calls snake hips), traveling w/IV figure 8s
Upper Body: (5 min) snake arms, snake arms in genie position & both arms fwd position, wrist circles
Shimmy: (2 min) basic shimmy (tells you to squeeze gluts & use knees), very fast omni (small hip circles) she calls milkshakes. she barely teaches how to do a hip circle before speeding it up unlike the previous teaching.
The above all has 1/2 time instruction & full tempo practice before moving on.
Cardio: (5 min) Full tempo w/a very fast/furious drum/cymbal beat w/her just calling out the moves. snake arms, shimmy, camel & traveling camel, pelvic drops, genie arms, etc.
Cardio 2: (5 min) Here is a good tempo Middle Eastern beat, Dolphina here tells you how to move your body & hints that you are stringing this practice into a routine. She also adds pelvic drop to a camel but still calls it good & plenty.
Routine (3 min): She calls out the moves as you do the routine. A bit bland & repetitious.
Cool Down: (90 seconds) hip lifts, slow shimmy & wide hip circles

Bonus:
Performance by Dolphina - quick, with a lot of pausing, way zoomed in angles, etc. so you can barely see any moves/style.
How to create a bellydance costume - (4 min) How dolphina has them in almost every color, to make sure you use bracelets, anklets, toe rings, belly chain, belly jewel, etc., accessories.

I decided not to re-purchase the ""Intro"" DVD because the camera angles didn't always show the moves, and because Dolphina, the host, was a bit annoying. I saw so many more positive reviews for ""Cardio"" that I bought it instead.
- BIG MISTAKE! The camera angles are a little better in this one, but Dolphina is sooooo much more annoying! She has this airy, lispy voice that makes her sound like a stereotypical ""dumb blond"". She keeps saying stupid phrases like, ""your a goddess"", ""you can't change everything about yourself, but you can change some things"", ""don't worry about it, your a goddess"", and did I mention ""your a goddess"". All of this is done with a fake, bleached smile plastered to her face.
- But the cherry on top of this disastrous sundae is that she doesn't even dance with the music! I couldn't believe that a dance instructor, who is doing simple side-to-side movements couldn't move with the 1-2-3 beat of a drum. It's pathetic. She does things like saying ""let's do 5 more"", but does seven more while counting to four.
- I could go on and on about miscellaneous other things like random hand twitches (not artistic or lyrical, just random), and long, pointless musical interludes between sections, but I won't waste any more of your time. I just hope you don't waste your time, and money, by buying this DVD.",1236124800,7,1543,4.676470588235294
3227020,5,B000WVPXBS,"Loved dolphina's latest video!

3227021,5,B000WVPXBS,"This is a great DVD that is easy to follow and is actually fun! Actually you do work up a sweat if you do as instructed and my heart rate was increased about 40-45% during the last half of the video. She made me laugh so hard when she mentions that 'isn't it great that you have a body and you can shake it?'--throughout the video you hear some funny things Dolphina says that you can't help but laugh! This is definately a fun alternative to boring exercise, I can't wait to use what I have learned on an audience--my hubby in particualr, lol.

3227022,5,B000WVPXBS,"I LOVED this video: the music is great, Dolphina is a good teacher, and the dance moves are fun.  I was so sore after my first run-through!!  This video is a great beginner belly dance video and just about anyone can do it.  Dolphina is not intimidating and she keep repeating positive affirmations about our bodies.  It's very refreshing to see someone on an exercise video telling you to love your body at all stages of life!",1218240000,2,427,4.5064935064935066
3227023,4,B000WVPXBS,A great companion to the Intro to Bellydance video.  I did this workout with a friend who has not done any bellydance before and she was able to follow along with Dolphina's instructions without any problem.,1217548800,,207,4.75
3227024,5,B000WVPXBS,This is a good DVD for workout and fun. You can choose your own workout in each day from the DVD session.,1212624000,,105,3.8181818181818183
3227025,5,B000WVPXBS,I have Doplhina's whole collection of DVD's and this is by far my favorite! Once you have the basics down from the beginner bellydance video you are able to reach your full speed and flow with a great 1 hour workout. I wish there were not such long pauses between each section..but thats her style I guess. I am part of a bellydanc club and we get together and do this DVD almost every week!!!!,1208649600,3,394,4.266666666666667
3227026,5,B000WVPXBS,"I have a few bellydance workout DVDs...but I have to say, I am very pleased with Dolphina's teaching style!  She really breaks each move down step by step.  This is the first time I feel I have made progress on my Camels.  Great cardio segment...you will feel it!",1206748800,9,263,4.4375
3227027,5,B000WVPXBS,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this new video from Dolphina.  It actually did get my heart rate up, which is more than I can say from some of the other videos out there.  The thing to remember is that Dolphina's videos are ""workout videos"" and not authentic bellydance instruction.  Keep that in mind and you should be able to enjoy it.  I do wish she had not called one of the steps ""milkshake"" though.  It made me think of the song by the same name (brings boys to the curve).  Gag.  Also, if you want more workout..you may wish to add a weight belt from [..]",1203552000,8,576,4.181818181818182
3227028,1,B000WVPXBS,"How they can call this video ""cardio"" is beyond me ... the pace is so slow you'll never get your heart rate up, and you'll never break a sweat. You could sleep walk through all the moves in the entire video, that's how lame it is. This is not exercise at all. :(

If you are a total beginner to belly dance and want a slow, well demonstrated view of belly dance moves, this could be good to start with for you.
Once you have the basic moves (typically, after 3-5 viewings of this DVD), go to Dolphina's ""Basics of Bellydance"". or just save time and money and start with that DVD to begin with. it's a much better workout then this, and you won't grow out of it in a week.

If you have mastered the basics of belly dance and are looking for a more challenging way to dance away the pounds, stay clear of this DVD. Instead got with Dolphina's earlier ""warrior goddess"" workout.",1203379200,15,875,4.233532934131737
8225860,5,B000WVPXBS,Great video. Too bad she doesn't still make them.,1517616000,,49,4.555555555555555
8225861,5,B000WVPXBS,Great work out.  Good warm up.  Easy to follow steps. I always feel great afterward.  I like all of the Dolphina work out videos that I've gotten.,1500422400,,146,4.333333333333333
8225862,5,B000WVPXBS,Good workout and hilarious dialog. I'm not sure how mermaids move their arms but I will bow to her expertise!,1456617600,,109,4.5
8225863,4,B000WVPXBS,I think it would be better if I had an ounce of rhythm.  But it does its job even if it looks like I'm inflatable arm flailing tube man.,1444867200,,136,3.689655172413793
8225864,3,B000WVPXBS,Not crazy for Dolphina's style,1421107200,,30,5.2
8225865,5,B000WVPXBS,I really enjoy working out with this belly dancing It take you step my step When you try to learn to Belly Dancing.,1394409600,,115,4.043478260869565
8225866,3,B000WVPXBS,Bought this for my wife. She wasn't thrilled with it. It wasn't entirely what she wanted. I think she may have used it a few times before retiring it to the church rummage sale.,1391817600,,177,4.235294117647059
8225867,5,B000WVPXBS,"I love it because the expertise is grand!  The workout does not seem like a workout because it is so much fun!  You can use this workout video as a tutorial, so that you can entertain others!  I would recommend this workout video any day!",1367798400,,238,4.2444444444444445
8225868,4,B000WVPXBS,"I bought this dvd because I lost 20 lbs with her beginner dvd, and figured I would give this a try. And this workout really makes you sweat! I always have fun with it, and it will kick your butt (which is why you'd use a workout dvd so it's not a bad thing). I give it 4 stars because Dolphina is a little cheesy, but with the extra performance you really get motivated to work out with her so you can have the skills she does one day!",1361145600,,435,3.898876404494382
8225869,4,B000WVPXBS,"I work in retail and I often feel to tired to exercise, so I'm struggling to get in a workout during my day.  This one challenged me and I worked up a good sweat.  It was also useful because I've been having a negative body image lately, and I came away feeling more positive about myself and feeling like I had accomplished something.  I know Dolphina's affirmations won't resonate with everyone (""Look down at your body shaking, and think how grateful you are you have a body and can shake it!"") but it made me feel chipper and made me want to work out again tomorrow, which is ultra useful for me.  If you're in great shape and/or you are at an advanced level of dance, you may not feel challenged with this DVD.

I took off a star because the cool-down is almost non-existent.  But I usually do my own series of stretches after I finish a workout DVD anyway, so after the cool-down ended I gave myself a good, thorough stretch.",1342569600,,931,4.3526011560693645
