8456237,3,B0054509KM,"the movies are great, but what i don't understand is everytime i buy one of these discount blurays or single disc basic box with just the picture on it blurays i feel like the quality isn't 100 percent the same as a brandnew multi disc special edition copy. for example, a basic bluray copy at target or walmart runs about 15 to 20 bucks. but the 4 disc special editon digital copy and whatever else it comes with will cost you about 35 to 40 bucks doesnt really seem the same to me me in quality. i have a great sony bluray player a great hdmi cable a full 1080p lcd tv and kickass surround sound. and i can tell when a bluray movies has a drop-off in quality. the sound and picture quality on a basic bluray feels lesser than a special editon to me. help me out guys, is it just in my head? next time look closely when you watch a movie, when there is a night time scene, the srceen seems a bit grainy. almost dvd quality. but its just my opinion.",1354233600,3,949,4.10752688172043
