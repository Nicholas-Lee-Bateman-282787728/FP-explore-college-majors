7925755,4,B00004WMFE,"As the experienced martial artist will realize from the silly review that was posted for this title, this is for the experienced swordsman rather than the juvenile martial arts (Bruce Lee) movie fan. The video shows the complete sword method taught at the Japanese Imperial Army's Toyama Military Academy from 1925 until around 1945, with kata and applications (bunkai) so it's really difficult to understand how the reviewer who claimed they were not there, missed them.
This is not a ""pretty"" fanciful style of swordsmanship, no back flips, handstands, or flaming swords doused in gasoline to please a crowd. In other words it won't win points in ""open circuit"" competitions but it is a truly effective fighting method that was used on the battlefield with devastating effect in the Pacific Theater as late as 1944.
Essential for the serious swordsman/collector!

7925756,2,B00004WMFE,"After reading the previous review I was under the impression that this was a comprehensive instructional video on Japanese sword technique. Instead, it is 50 minutes of a man with a pot belly swinging his katana and bokken. There is no 'bunkai', only one episodee of 'kumitachi', and the techniques used are nothing to write home about. Anyone with a basic understanding of kenjutsu or kendo will find this video a waste of time. Save your money and buy Dave Lowry's book titled ""Bokken."" You'll learn a lot more for a lot less! I did give this video two stars because I got a kick out of the swingin' 70's white pants and see-through shirt which were worn throughout the video!!",990835200,,679,4.619834710743802
7925757,4,B00004WMFE,"BACKGROUND
In 1925 Lieutenant Morinaga Kiyoshi contacted Nakayama Hakudo on behalf of the Army, requesting his assistance in compiling a set of sword forms which could be used on the battlefield. Morinaga sensei served several tours of duty as a fencing instructor at the Toyama Military Academy as lieutenant, captain, and major. Later, from 1939 - 45, Lieutenant Colonel Morinaga was the Director of Fencing at the Toyama Academy. As such, he was responsible for expanding the iai curriculum from five kata to seven. This was technically accomplished by deleting the 1925 version of form 5, and adding a new form 5, 6, and 7.
Today there are three major traditions of Toyama Ryu iaido extant, each style incorporating slight variations and interpretations of the foundational techniques; yet, these separate factions possess more similarities than differences. The three traditions are taught by each style's senior representative: Morinaga Kiyoshi sensei, Nakamura Taizaburo sensei, and Yamaguchi Yuuki sensei. Of the three masters, only Nakamura sensei (90 years old) actively teaches class. Morinaga sensei died in 1981 at age 86, and Yamaguchi sensei, close to 100 years old, has recently retired; however, his school is still active and is taught by Hontai Yoshin Ryu jujutsu's soke Inoue Tsuyoshi Munetoshi sensei.
TOKUTOMI TASABURO

Tokutomi Tasaburo -- the author of this video -- was one of Morinaga Kiyoshi sensei's long-time disciples. He appeared briefly in the 1980 video ""Einaru Budo"" [released as ""Budo: The Art of Killing"" English] where he and Nakamura Taizaburo sensei appeared opposite each other near the end of the video: they both walk towards each other a' la ""High Noon"" -- then commence paired ""kumitachi"" forms.
REVIEW
This 55-minute Japanese language video is a valuable source for the martial artist and researcher. The fact that it is in Japanese may be slightly frustrating, but the advantages of actually seeing the techniques performed is worth having it in one's research library.
Previously unknown to me as a researcher, this video has already proven its worth by enabling me to compare the video against Japanese army manuals. In the past, I had to puzzle through the textual descriptions of actual movements and guess the directions of travel, angle of attack, and so on. The twin scourges -- Incomprehension and Misinterpretation -- are always hanging around the corner when dealing written Japanese; with this tape, I was finally able to fully understand the manual's written descriptions. I feel fortunate that Tsunami Video was able to obtain this recently made video, and make it available to martial arts researchers.
I have closely compared the techniques portrayed in this valuable video to descriptions in both the Japanese Army manual ""Kenjutsu Kyohan Shokai"" (1925) and ""Gunto no Soho oyobi Tameshigiri"" (1940). The techniques in this video appear to represent the original forms - unchanged -- taught at the Rikugun Toyama Gakko. In addition to other techniques, this video teaches the original 5 forms from 1925, plus the three other forms added around 1940, for a total of 8 kata. Tokutomi sensei is well qualified and executes his movements cleanly and effectively.
TECHNIQUES

The video begins with ""Basic Iai"" and clearly depicts the standing bow performed towards the front of the dojo and Shinto shrine, and the standing bow to the sword. My notes mention that Tokutomi sensei takes a deeper, ""classical"" stance while cutting (we are taught an almost upright body position). Next comes the six ""Foundational Iai"" techniques viewed from the front, accompanied by both a Japanese language voice-over and super-script. This section includes paired forms (kumitachi) with a wooden sword; actually, these are blocks and beat-parries. A follow-on section details the technique with close-up video shots of the applied technique. Finally, the Foundational set is performed again, but from a side view. Happo-nuki, Eight Directions of Drawing, is performed next.
For those who have studied Nakamura sensei's teachings, be forewarned that these techniques are not the same as Nakamura Ryu ""Happo-Giri."" Tokutomi sensei goes through a series of eight sword-drawing and cutting exercises as he pivots to each of eight directions. This is a nice exercise in which a full draw and cut is incorporated. This section is subdivided into three groupings: (1) the entire exercise performed without pause, (2) the break-down and explanation of each move, and (3) another view of the technique from the rear.
The Foundation Iai and Happo-nuki exercises are intended to teach basic movement and sword handling. The next section is called ""Hon Iai"" and means ""True Iai."" These are the eight kata that are performed by each of the three different factions: the forms that represent the Toyama Military Academy. The eight forms are performed nonstop, from beginning to end. Next, as with the previous techniques mentioned above, the eight forms are shown again individually, with voice-overs and super-script. Finally, all eight forms are again depicted from the side.
The final section covers a few minutes tameshigiri - test cutting. The tameshigiri performed shows technique, angle-of-attack, and distance. As with Nakamura sensei's teachings, the tameshigiri on this video is not gratuitous cutting: there are hard and fast learning objectives involved.
RECOMMENDATION

I strongly recommend this video if only to understand the original techniques of Toyama Ryu as they were taught from 1925 -1945. Even adherents of Yamaguchi sensei and Nakamura sensei should own a copy in order to understand the variances as currently taught. And for those unaware, beware! Although both Yamaguchi sensei and Nakamura sensei teach Toyama Ryu iaido, they incorporated some changes. But - that is another story.
