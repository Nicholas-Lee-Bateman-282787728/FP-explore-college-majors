963166,3,6305071454,"This is one of those rare European horror flicks from the 70's that has developed something of a following based on viewings of poor quality bootleg videos. Now available in an uncut, widescreen transfer, the Devil's Nightmare stands as a minor classic of 70's gothic. It's no Suspiria or Lisa and the Devil, but what is?

Standard plot of tourists stranded in an eerie castle being done in, gruesomely, one by one is enlivened by interesting touches throughout. Each victim is made to symbolize one of the 7 deadly sins. There's a scarred, sinister butler who loves to tell stories about the castle's various victims, a baron who has a (atmospherically photographed) laboratory in the cellar, a Nazi flashback, and last, but not least, Erika Blanc as a sexy succubus who fulfills the family curse. The devil pops up, played by Fellini fave Daniel Emilfork.

Not as gory as one might expect, with photography that alternates between atmospheric and flat, occasionally intrusive music, and bland acting from all but Blanc and Emilfork.

963167,4,6305071454,"I actually got this on a four-disc item called ""Blood Bath"", and that's comparatively A LOT less than what this DVD goes for. But anyway, to the film...

""Devil's Nightmare"" is a gothic horror film from the early '70s and takes the concept of people that each represent one of the Seven Deadly Sins, puts them in an atmospheric, spooky castle, and ultimately presents a dark and mysterious, very dream-like mood throughout. After seeing the film, I had mixed feeling, although I kept in mind that compared to some of the stuff I've seen, it's really not bad. In fact, ""Devil's Nightmare"" is not a bad film by any means, it's just really easy to trash a movie where not a whole lot happens in the first hour. I know a lot of old-school horror movie save up the biggest suspense for the last 15 minutes or so, but I felt as though ""Devil's Nightmare"" could've had a little more suspense throughout the first 50 minutes or so (although there is a HOT lesbian scene not too far into the film).

As I said, most of the biggest stuff takes place within the last half-hour or so, and that seriously gives an exciting kick to the movie. However, I did feel the very last scene was unnecessary, taking what could have been a perfect suitable happy ending and giving it a random downer of an ending for no reason. This definitely helped take away a star from the movie, because for me, a good ending can be what seperates a four-star film from a five-star film.

However, keep in mind all the good this movie has going for it. A dreamlike setting, a dark and mysterious atmosphere, some awesome death scenes and of course that hot lesbian scene. Overall, it's definitely not a perfect film but if you're in the mood for something with atmosphere and also some good kills, ""Devil's Nightmare"" should serve as an interesting and enjoyable view.

NOTE!!! The film opens up with an eight-minute introduction that has absolutely NO place in this movie whatsoever, BUT it's one of the greatest horror-related things I've seen in a while. A hot vampire lady in black? Her naked, crawling hot cannibal twin sisters? Biting each other's necks and spilling lots of blood? An altar with snakes on it? Some of the cheapest camera work I've ever seen? GENIUS! I wanna see a film with these lovely, twisted ladies in it! For whatever reason they talk about cannibal films, even though ""Devil's Nightmare"" is gothic horror, but I mean COME ON! How can any sane horror lover not totally dig this introduction?

Well, that's about it for this review. I'm gonna try to get 31 horror movie reviews in, one for each day of October until Halloween. If you come across this movie, try to check it out, because it's definitely a film you'll remember for a long time. As for me, I'm off to find a trio of cannibalistic vampire hotties and write a B-movie script for them! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1255737600,,2869,4.563106796116505

963169,5,6305071454,"THE DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE (1971; 93 minutes; Belgium/Italy)

THE PLOT: Seven people are forced to spend the night in some eerie castle. The devil sends a succubus to kill each one that indulges in one or more of the seven deadly sins (lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy/jealousy and pride).

COMMENTARY: Wow, this is a real hidden gem of Gothic horror. It has a great cast & story and was filmed in a real castle. The people and the sins they indulge in are as follows:

Pride - Alvin, the Seminarian

Envy - Corinne (the hot brunette), the collector of men

Gluttony - Mr. Ducha, the Tour Driver

Lust - Howard Foster, Corinne's last addition to her collection

Anger - Mr. Mason, the constant complainer

Greed - Nancy Foster, the gold seeking angry wife

Sloth - Regine, the (hot) sleepy blonde

Some, of course, are guilty of more than one main sin, such as:

- Nancy Foster, the angry wife: jealousy (although her husband gives her good reason to be jealous), envy (of the beauty of the other women) and anger (I don't think she smiles once, except when she's literally swimming in gold).

- Corinne: lust (lesbianism & adultery).

- Regine: lust (lesbianism).

A handful of observations:

- If the bus driver was really THAT gluttonous wouldn't he be a lot heavier? (Like Fat Bast*** from Austin Powers).

- If Regine (the blond) were really THAT lazy how could she possibly have that ultra-hot body?

- Although the priest-in-training flirts with pride (listen to him during the chess match) and lust (for the redhead) he evidently never commits a mortal sin (or, if he does, he humbly & quickly repents rather than revel in it like the others).

*** MINOR SPOILER ALERT *** Note that the seminarian willingly sacrifices himself to perdition to prevent the other six from being damned. This is an example of agape love and displays a Christ-like heart. Paul the apostle had the same spirit as evidenced in Romans 9:3. *** END SPOILER ***

- But doesn't Alvin know you can't make honest deals with the ""father of lies""?

- No one can argue that the film glorifies the various negative behaviors because *** SPOILER ALERT *** they all end up dying for their sins. *** END SPOILER ***

HIGHLIGHTS: As noted, the film features three incredibly gorgeous women -- a blond, brunette and redhead, no less. The succubus is the redhead, played by Erika Blanc. All three are voluptuous; each possessing a very distinctive beauty. (Their NATURAL curvy-ness is refreshing in comparison to too many modern American actresses who often appear nigh anorexic and artificial, if you know what I mean). It goes without saying that, if you have a lust problem, you might want to skip this one, especially in light of a fairly overt lesbian scene.

Another highlight is Erika Blanc's subtle make-up as the succubus combined with her amazing ability to contort her face from stunningly sharp to utterly hideous. I almost never get frightened by horror films, but when Erika morphs into the succubus and hideously contorts her face, it's pretty chilling.

TECHNICAL INFO: Some versions of the film have a tasteless porno-horror ""intro"" tacked on. This lengthy ""intro"" is not part of the original picture and simply has no business being there; in fact, it horribly mars it. No doubt it was tacked on by some latter-day producer in order to excite pre-pubescent boys (""Oooh, that's cooooool!""). The version featured with ""Messiah of Evil"" doesn't have this silly intro, but the sound quality isn't very good. I saw another version that has the intro but the sound quality was fine.

FYI: The original title translated to English is ""The Long Night of the Devil"" or ""The Devil's Longest Night."" I feel the title ""The Devil's Nightmare"" is weak and much prefer another alternative title (used on the VHS): ""The Devil Walks at Midnight.""

FINAL WORD: Since this is a European film from the early 70s it's understandably dated, dubbed and slow-paced. The viewer must keep this in mind to appreciate it. Many themes are touched upon: Does God exist? What about the devil and his demonic servants? Can he be trusted to make a deal with? (Yeah, right). Is there such a thing as sin? And, if so, what are its consequences? Another fascinating theme is human nature and the continual conflict between spiritual and carnal qualities with which we can all relate. The film also powerfully addresses the self-sacrificial nature of agape love.

Make no mistake, this is a powerful piece of Gothic-horror cinema, perhaps even a masterpiece.

The film runs 95 minutes and was shot at Chteau d'Antoing, Antoing, Hainault, Wallonia, Belgium.

This film will not be for everyone.  I've seen some reviews for this film that are not good...and those people are right.  It's isn't a great film.

963171,2,6305071454,"A busload of morally ambiguous tourists are rerouted to the spooky castle of a former Nazi baron (formerly a Nazi, still a baron) in order to save the rest of the travel for the following day. Coincidentally, the baron's daughter, a succubus, shows up to condemn the tourists to varying circles of Hell, using the 'Seven Deadly Sins' as the guidebook.

Apparently, the Seven Deadly Sins consist of the following:

  (1) Sin: Lust. Punishment= Cheating husband and insatiable brunette strumpet are killed by medieval torture devices.

  (2) Sin: Greed. Punishment= Ugly frigid wife suffocates on gold glitter.

  (3) Sin: Gluttony. Punishment= Gruesome slob is invited to a gigantic feast and then, after gorging himself and making any perspective viewer (such as myself) nauseous, chokes to death on a glass of wine.

  (4) Sin: Guilty Of Being A Hot Bisexual Blonde Who Lounges Seductively In A Bed. Punishment= Death by python!!!!!

  (5) Sin: Complaining Too Much. Punishment= Old creep kept awake all night and then thrown from a tower window.

So anyway, there you have it, all 5 of the Seven Deadly Sins and the corresponding Dante-style punishments. Additionally, this movie boasts the worst Satan of all time.

963172,2,6305071454,"""Devil's Nightmare"" has an intriguing cult reputation, and some bizarre stills of the film's star Erika Blanc that are taken from it promise it to be quite a lurid thriller...sadly it isn't.

Seven tourists stay overnight at a large castle, and are regaled with gruesome history tales by the ghoulish butler. The host tells them the family is cursed by a succubus, whereupon an eighth guest suddenly arrives in the shape of the stunning Ms Blanc. No prizes for guessing what she is then! After bewitching the other guests with her sultry demeanor and revealing gowns, she gradually works her way through the lot of them, managing to lure them to various inventive deaths one after another, all of which are themed around each of the characters various sinful leanings (greed, lust, etc). Only a priest seems able to resisit the charms of the mystery woman...will he be able to break the terrible curse?

Yes I know that plot sounds like it could have been somehow worked into a stylish and shocking gothic horror, but something vital is really missing from this effort. I think it's down to a general lack of polish and care, and attention to laying down any sort of atmosphere. The castle where all the main action takes place is a stunning building on the oustide, but the interior is not nearly as impressive - especially the bedrooms that the guests are shown to, they are kitted out in the most appalling over-fussy floral decor, each one more hideous than the last.  There's little sense of art direction, especially in hilariously bad scenes when the characters are supposed to be creeping around looking for a way out of the castle in nothing but candlelight, whereas in fact all these scens are visibly and harshly over-lit with industrial arc-lighting! The continuation and photography is also very poor with a great deal of obvious inconsistencies in the brightness of the sky outside. The English dubbing is also very, very bad. It makes a mockery of all the acting, although even good dubbing would not save the actor playing the priest, who gives the blandest, most wooden performance I have ever seen, almost single-handedly dragging what little tension there is towards the film's climax into the gutter.

On the plus side, Erika Blanc makes for a pretty dashing succubus, with her appearance altering to a pale, skeletal fright-face every time she is about her killing business. She also manages to pull off some very weird and wonderful contortions which verge on the pantomime, but luckily fall on just the right side of creepy. But the death scenes are all very cheaply handled and laughably unlikely. The behaviour of the guests is never anything less than totally vapid, even when faced with obvious danger. And to my total non-surprise (this being a European horror film from the 1970's), there's also a totally gratuitous lesbian sex scene that goes completely nowhere plot-wise...oh well, at least all the women in this film are very attractive so for those that want to see topless beauties doing the business, there's a small helping of that just for you. For anyone who is interested in plot, gothic atmosphere or just plain horror, this films serves up such thin helpings of each of those that it's really not worth the effort.

I'm sorry to be negative, and I was disappointed myself, but aside from Erica Blanc in what is probably her most memorable horror appearance, there's barely anything memorable in this.",1157241600,3,3442,4.876923076923077
963173,3,6305071454,"Seven tourists (representing the seven deadly sins) end up having to spend the night together. Along comes a yummy succubi to throw in some evening entertainment. It's a low budget 70's flick, but is still pretty good.

963174,4,6305071454,"Mainstream critics made much of Seven (1995, aka Se7en) for its ""innovative"" twist on the serial killer oeuvre: A killer who took inspiration from the Seven Deadly Sins.

Not so innovative.

Innovative to big Hollywood studios.  Innovative to ignorant mainstream critics.  But for those who follow indie, low-budget, and foreign horror ... been there, done that.

More precisely, it was The Devil's Nightmare that did it.  Not with a serial killer, but with a succubus (Italian actress Erika Blanc).  No reason succubi can't take inspiration from the Seven Deadly Sins while committing slaughter.

In the film (The Devil's Nightmare is its most common US title, The Devil Walks at Midnight its most recent), a family of German aristocrats endures a centuries-old curse.  Seems the first-born daughter in every generation becomes a succubus for Satan.  She seems not to particularly target family members, so there's no reason this should be a big problem, but the family has long done the right thing by killing first-born daughters at birth.  But it's 1945, and the Allies are bombing Germany, and confusion reigns.  The Baron (Jean Servais), an officer in Hitler's army, kills the wrong daughter.

Flash-forward to 1971, and the prodigal first-born daughter returns to the family castle.

As luck would have it, that very night a busload of tourists is stranded at the castle.  And coincidentally, each tourist is guilty of one of the Seven Deadly Sins.  After slinking about in revealing dresses, the succubus begins killing the tourists, one by one.  The women too.  That's rare for succubi, as most only target men.  And she's got help.  When she is stymied by Father Sorel (guilty of pride, and played by Luciene Raimberg), Satan (Daniel Emilfork) steps in to help her out.

  Succubus films are largely and properly judged by the quality of their succubi.  Even more so than vampires, succubi are erotic monsters.  Female demons who sexually tempt men to death and/or damnation.  Why do they do so?  Usually, the only explanation is that they're demons, and that's what demons do.

  Being sexual monsters, succubi should be alluring.  Erika Blanc is that and more.  She is a mesmerizing demoness, with extreme angular features, a fleshy but curvaceous body, and clear bright eyes framed by a flaming red mane.  Few modern succubi can compare.  Today's direct-to-video succubi (and ""femme fatales"") tend to be short, scrawny, and disproportionately top-heavy with chicken legs.  Perhaps most of today's low-budget producers are ""breast men"" attracted to anorexic starlets.  Blanc is a classy succubus, well-proportioned, the kind that best tempts European (and, I think, most) men.

  Personality-wise, her succubus is more pedestrian.  Most succubi are heartless monsters, without feeling for their victims.  Vampires often have more compassion, or at least passion.  Ironically, succubi are often indifferent to sex, merely using it mechanically as a bait and/or method of execution, killing during copulation.  But Blanc doesn't even touch her victims, gleefully watching them die from afar.  She is an especially cold-blooded succubus, her sole loyalty to Satan.

  Some succubi kill to survive, but Blanc kills to win souls for Satan.  She kills sinners during their transgressions, ensuring that they'll be damned for eternity.  This yields some curious theological results.  One young lady is killed asleep in bed, presumably guilty of sloth.

  Sleeping in the middle of the night -- Oh wicked woman!

  Well, sloth is one of the Seven Deadly Sins.  I dunno, maybe it was early evening.  Just make sure there are no succubi around if you go to bed early.

  Most succubi merely reflect a surface beauty, skin deep.  At some point, their natural ugliness is revealed.  In the ""Demon In Lace"" episode of Kolchak: The Night Stalker, the succubus's true appearance was that of a crone.  Whenever Blanc kills, her true form manifests: her eyebrows shaved, her face shiny and bluish, her thin red lips in a tight sadistic smile.

  My favorite succubus is Karen Morgan (played by Diane DiLascio in the ""Black Widow"" episode of Poltergeist: The Legacy).  DiLascio portrayed a rarity: a succubus-with-a-heart-of-gold.  Her succubus had feelings.  Feelings that could be hurt by a harsh word.  I'd never before seen a succubus played that way.  Other viewers must have agreed, because DiLascio's succubus returned for a rare encore episode: ""She Has the Devil in Her.""

  Erika Blanc would be enough to recommend The Devil's Nightmare, but the film is enjoyable all-around.  The other actors do a fine job, and the cinematography is lush and colorful.

  Welch Everman, in his Cult Horror Films, says: ""This Belgian/Italian spooky- castle film is really pretty good, not because the plot is particularly original but because the pacing and atmosphere make it work in spite of its shortcomings.""  I guess he means the film waits 50 minutes to begin the killings, but he's right, the pacing works.  It allows the atmosphere to build, the succubus to toy with her victims, and the characters to become established, if only a bit.  (Why do all European actors, when dubbed, sound alike?)

  Less kind is John Stanley in his Creature Features Movie Guide: ""Campy dialogue and silly premise provide laughs in this Italian-Belgian flop ... Each generation's eldest daughter is born an evil witch lusting to kill.""  I wasn't laughing, and the story is plainly about a succubus, not a witch.

  Foreign film spellings appear to confuse everyone.  Welch Everman spells the name of the actor playing Father Sorel as both Luciene Raimberg and Lucien Raimbourg.  He spells the aristocrat family's name as both von Rumberg and von Runberg, whereas John Stanley spells it von Rhoneberg.

  Mildly annoying to me: In the dubbed version, the characters keep referring to ""succubuses.""  The American Heritage Dictionary (1971) finds this acceptable, but I think ""succubi"" is preferable.  (""Succubae"" is also acceptable to American Heritage.)

  If you like succubi -- and who doesn't? -- you'll like The Devil's Nightmare.",1149724800,11,6110,5.172484599589322

963279,3,6305071454,"I actually did take quite a fancy to this film about a busload of tourists stranded by a storm, each with their own particular foibles coalescent with the ""Seven Deadly Sins"". They are accompanied by a priest to a beautiful, though cursed castle, wherein an erubescent Succubus {the ""curse""} spontaneously appears and immediately goes about exploiting each of their prominent desires, dispatching them, thereby damning their souls. All succumb except for the priest who himself eventually ends up signing a pact with The Devil {here portrayed by a robed bald man with a skeletal smile} for the seemingly altruistic purpose of condemning his own soul unto Satan in place of the tourists' - however, there certainly is a lethal catch.

 The strange occurrences begin with a bleeding dead cat whose orange? blood seeps through the floorboards, through the ceiling of the bottom level, and onto the arm of one of the girls - thus, first blood is shed, as is first scream {one would think there was a devil-worshipper lurking about!}. Such is the case with the tint of the blood in the movie.

 The Succubus goes from 0 - 666 in 9 seconds shedding her eyebrows and rosy complexion upon the demise of her victims during the commission of their erstwhile ""sins"" - methods range from impalements to beheadings to poisonings, as well as the deadly embrace of the iron maiden.

 In attempting to form the origin of the villainous character, one is subjected to at least between 5 - 10 minutes of Nazi derivation, the nativity of the baby girl who would become Succubus. A daughter of Nazis. I wonder what contemporary law-abiding German citizens think about that portrayal, in a country where signaling the ""Sig Heil"" salute is a crime and carries a penalty of incarceration.

 Of note, a sizzling lesbian scene between a gorgeous brunette and modelesque blonde accompanied by some awful ""music"" {which is more like irritating sound effects, which may have been intentional} can be quite distracting.

 Interestingly enough, there is no dramatic ""good vs. evil"" epic battle, just a subtle agreement between The Devil and the priest, wherein The Prince of Darkness derives what he desires, and apparently, so does the priest, as the redhead is no longer possessed, and joins him by his side, granting a gaze of acknowledgement unto Lucifer. So ultimately, the ill-fated tourists were mere puppets in the midst of the interaction between Scratch and priest.

 The Devil's Nightmare is a French film with English dubbing, and was originally called ""The Terrible Night of The Demon"", containing a decidedly Hammer films flavor to it.

 ________________________________

 Note 1: Needless to say, yet perhaps bearing a small though obvious commentary, Satanism does not recognize these catholic ""sins"", but instead realizes these traits as normal and natural in the humanimal, which motivates evolution in the awareness of the flesh.

The only bad thing I have to say about the dvd, was the stupid beginning with Eileen Daly, in which she refers to a totally different Redmption film. Why does Redemption need to subject us to this with every film?  Now this is unneccesarily gory and very homo-annoying.
Anyway, getting back to the movie.  This tells the story of 6 tourists and a bus driver, finding shelter in an old castle owned by a Baron whose family has been cursed for centuries.  During dinner the guests are joined by a beautiful woman (Erika Blanc) who may or may not be a succubus (a devil's handmaiden).  Each of the tourists, including the bus driver represents the seven deadly sins, and each falling victim to that sin with the help of Blanc.  I love the premise of good vs. evil.  The director leads you into believing that you're in store for a usual stupid horror film, but, in essence, he's led us into a thinking man's film, full of contradictions, in which we're totally stunned at the end.

963283,4,6305071454,"Devil's Nightmare is a pretty impressive Belgian gothic horror film from 1971.  The movie begins with a Nazi officer's wife giving birth during the collapse of the Third Reich; when he finds out the child is a girl, the officer, Baron von Rhoneberg, is rather displeased and shows his unhappiness in a pretty compelling way.  Then we jump to the present day to find seven tourists forced to seek a night's shelter at the castle of von Rhoneberg (apparently Belgium had no hotels in 1971).  Personally, the sight of the castle door opening all by itself would be enough to convince me to just sleep on the bus, but the seven tourists all rush inside to escape a sudden rainstorm.  Along with the melancholy and mysterious Baron, the guests are welcomed by a sour puss of a serving lady and a rather grim butler type who has served the Baron since World War II.  This guy delights in telling the guests just who died in what way and in what year in each of the bedrooms he assigns them.  The tourists are not exactly rays of sunshine themselves.  There is a greedy woman and her cheating husband, an ornery old man, a seminarian studying to become a priest, a pretty disgusting tour guide, a lazy blonde lady, and an especially lovely flirt whose hobby is collecting men.  The castle is a perfectly gothic little setting, featuring an attic with a good selection of implements of torture, dark and intricate hallways, gloomy towers and balustrades, an alchemist's lab, etc.-basically everything a spooky old castle needs to have.  Later that night, a sultry redhead arrives in the form of Erika Blanc, whose character turns out to be a little unusual.  Before all the guests turn in for the night, they are naturally told the story of the ancient von Rhoneberg curse, a large part of which deals with each family member's eldest daughter being a succubus.  After a good hour crafting the proper atmosphere for the film, characters finally start dying, each death patterned on one of the seven deadly sins.  This succubus doesn't do the things a succubus is supposed to do, never going farther than a little flirting with the priest in training, but I suppose the results are what really count.  Having a priest in the way presents something of a challenge, but Satan is more than read to step in if problems arise.
I wouldn't call this film scary at all, nor is it too graphic (except for the disgusting scene wherein we have to watch the tour guide eat).  The succubus' facial expressions when she is exerting her power are overdone to the point of being sort of silly, but Satan knows how to play his hand close to the vest.  There is some light nudity and just a little female hanky-panky, which I was a little surprised to find in a movie from 1971.  Erika Blanc is a strikingly sultry lady who lights up the screen, thanks in large part to the film's costume designer, but I find Ivana Novak even easier on these eyes of mine.  The atmosphere of the movie is quite dramatic, with the story of the curse working in hand in hand with the great and properly gothic look of the mysterious old castle, and the distinctive organ music that is forever playing in the background really helps establish the proper mood for infernal goings-on here.  The ending seemed as if it would leave me a little disappointed, but a nice touch at the last minute won me over.  All told, this is an excellent example of foreign, campy gothic horror that I for one quite enjoyed.",1048291200,15,3458,4.59349593495935

Unfortunately the print used for this DVD is not so great. However it's a pleasure to discover such rare movies from the Sixties-Seventies. A fine combination of horror and erotism ! Lovers of European horror movies from that period will probably enjoy it.",1046649600,2,427,4.417721518987341
963285,2,6305071454,"Erika Blanc would have been wise to pass on this piece of work as im sure it helped kill an already mediocre career. Nothing happens in this film for the first 60 min. then everyone gets killed in the next 10 min. Sensual? yes, Entertaining? not even close.

7882599,4,6305071454,"Seven passengers must spend the night at the cursed Baron's castle due to poor planning. The passengers clearly represent the seven deadly sins (not exactly biblical) as each one is murdered according to their sin, some more clearly than others.

I have seen this film several times before, but this one had a modern introduction of a lesbian vampire Elvira with two well endowed topless cannibal women, none of which had anything to do with the film which they describe as Italian camp. I liked the blue bus. It reminded me of the blue bus that used to always be in the parking lot of a Grateful Dead concert. Thank you Bear. Now if you haven't figured it out, Gilligan's Island was also patterned after the seven deadly sins. After a trip to the blue bus, it becomes fun to imagine the island characters as their counterparts in the film, especially during the lesbian make out scene. Would that be Ginger and Mary Ann?  It was for me.

The film wasn't restored but was still watchable. I watched it on a multi-pack.

I liked the story and i loved the seductive qualities of the film.i didn't care much for the entro with the lesbo vampires.super natural stories have always intrigued me, good verses evil. i love films where the guy gets his woman/woman gets her man. and the bad get whats coming to them. i have been looking for this film for years with no luck.

Found it on a horror pack for very cheap. Could their be a more irresistibly seductive succubus than the sultry Erika Blanc? She says more with her mandibles and fierce eyes than any contrived dialogue she's required to produce. Not much depth or imagination in the characters and the effects are archaic at best.

7882605,4,6305071454,"Pretty good Italian/Belgian erotic horror film.  The erotica is not explicit but pretty risqu, even for the early 1970s.  The horror involves the seven deadly sins and a succubus that is going to give the sinners what's coming to them.  A bus tour gets stranded at an isolated, creepy castle during a storm.  After that everything hits the fan.  I bought a used copy of the Image Entertainment version from Amazon and the quality is excellent.  My only complaint is that the prologue before the movie begins has some vampiric horror hostess attacking some nude women and blood and gore everywhere.  It's a bit too over the top and disturbing.  Other than that this version is highly recommended.",1382140800,,695,4.830508474576271
7882606,4,6305071454,I remember watching this long ago and it had a big impact on me. Maybe it was the creepy theme. Perhaps the hint of a Se7en style plot (which wouldn't be released for another 20 years). I recall some very cool death scenes but they don't hold up well now. Gold bars that looked cool on VHS 30 years ago are gold glitter on DVD. The death scenes and the pacing in general could use a good edit. I still love the transformation of the female demon. It is creepy and convincing. This movie still manages to be a lot of fun despite its age. Did I mention there are some terrific cast members here? All the women are gorgeous. I love the depressing 70's era ending because they don't do those anymore. This 1998 DVD release has managed to hold its value.,1377734400,,749,4.244755244755245
