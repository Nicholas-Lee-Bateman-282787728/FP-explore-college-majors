2449363,4,B000BYY0UG,"The acting in this film was very good.  The story line was also believable (sort of).  Stars DO go supernova.  The graphics and special effects were above average.  The only weak link was (SPOILER!!  BEWARE!!) when they discovered a mistake in the mathmatical formula, the sun problems stopped!  That's a little odd.

I also liked the subplot.  Very unusual for this type of film.  And the actor playing the bad guy was very creepy!

So...all in all a very underrated flick.  Butter the popcorn!",1231027200,,495,4.773809523809524
2449364,4,B000BYY0UG,"I purchased this for as a Christmas present, and so really can't say if it's good or bad.

2449365,4,B000BYY0UG,"This time, the sun is our enemy.  The very thing that nourishes life on this planet becomes the potential instrument to end all life as we know it.  A piece of a planet that has been traveling thru space for millions of years collides with the sun.  The result is sunspots run amok.

The title of the film is an attention-grabber, to be sure, but it's mis-leading on a couple of counts.  First of all, during the film a young astronomer tells a reporter that the sun ""will expand until it envelops the inner solar system, including Earth.  This is known as a Supernova.""  This is fudged science in a couple of different ways.  First off, a Supernova is when a star blows up (with the magnitude of something like a trillion trillion trillion times the force of the combined nuclear arsenal of all the world's militaries, I might add).

Secondly, the fact that the sun will someday expand and engulf the inner solar system is TRUE.  Of course, it will be something like 5 billion years down the road.  It will happen after the hydrogen fuel is used up & the sun will begin burning helium instead.

The biggest problem I have with the movie writers inserting this scenario into the movie is that they seemed to just ""throw it in"" without much of a cogent reason to do so.  The focus of the film was on these huge sunspots that were wreaking havoc with electronics, with some nasty expulsed ""fireballs"" from the sun hitting the earth.  They talked of fearing one of these fireballs would shear off the atmosphere.  It is not in debate that if something went awry with the sun ever so slightly, it could lead to the destruction of the earth.  Their ""throwing in"" the bit about the sun's expansion was simply superfluous.

Third, our sun will never, ever go Supernova (i.e.:  blow up) because it is simply too small.  It doesn't have enough mass for the reaction to occur.  After it expands to being the size of a small red giant (or so?) it will then shrink & end its life as a brown dwarf star.  Only big bad stars go Supernova - not our beloved sun!

For what it is, this is a pretty good end-of-the-world movie.  To be sure, the movie paints with a VERY wide brush.  It tries to give you the reaction of people from many different walks of life in a situation where the earth itself only has  a week or so left to live.  Some may tire of the attention given to some of the subplots, including one in particular that is almost another story all by itself.

Still, I did like some of the introspective, ""this is it"" moments where the characters reflected on all that they had left un-done in life.  However, I should give fair warning that there are also some un-anticipated disturbing scenes of violence against women.  Just so you know going in.....

The cast is pretty good, featuring the lovely Tia Carrere and Luke Perry.  This is one of the very few times I've seen Perry since he graduated from BEVERLY HILLS 90210.  It's also quite a different role for Perry to portray a braniac astrophysicist, but he pulls it off quite well.

These days, there is  one thing more horrifying than the sun throwing a solar temper-tantrum which may squelch life on earth.  What's that?  you ask.  Well, it's having the Bush administration in-charge of such a crisis situation.  If they re-made the movie today they could add on that little tidbit.  That alone would make the movie scarier than HALLOWEEN and have crowds running in a panic from the theatres in throngs!",1197849600,5,3455,4.502415458937198
2449366,2,B000BYY0UG,"Well, another natural disaster movie begins so very promisingly and ends so disappointingly.  Peter Fonda's role was the best part of the movie ... you can have the rest.

I saw it coming about halfway through the film when Luke Perry's character commented that his own equations were the basis of Peter Fonda's EOTW conclusion.  My heart sank as the rest of the film was dedicated to the search for where he went wrong, turning out to be a plus sign where a minus sign should have been in his original calculations.

The sun stopped spitting fireballs at the Earth, no more cities or forests were laid waste, the bad guy was shot by the woman he'd terrorized, and the rains came and made everything better.  Like, bummer!

I'm still searching for that EOTW via natural disaster movie that really *does* conclude with the end of the world.  Does it exist out there somewhere?  It must.  I'll continue to look ... and no doubt encounter many more disappointments along the way.

This film was, bottom line, a let-down to the genre of natural disaster films.  I could have done without it.",1182902400,2,1087,4.638743455497382

2449369,4,B000BYY0UG,"Peter Fonda is a wacky but brilliant astrophysicist.  He has discovered that our sun is much older than previously believed and that it will go supernova in about a week.  Fonda heads out to enjoy his final days without telling anyone.  He did pass his findings to several other scientists around the world and that brings the US Government into play.  Luke Perry worked with Fonda and everyone thinks he has the answers and knows where Fonda is.  Meanwhile Fonda's predictions start to come true as the sun's behavior starts to cause havoc with magnetic fields and electronic communications.

Perry discovers that there are government plans to preserve humanity they just didn't expect such a complete disaster.  But they start making their moves anyway.  Perry's wife is terrified of a killer she survived and how is about to be executed.  He escapes (no surprise there).  Global conditions continue to worsen and the death toll begins to skyrocket.  A supernova would destroy the entire solar system.  The only hope is that Fonda made a mistake in his calculations.  Will the world survive?  Watch and find out.

I guess they didn't want to call this Nova (our sun isn't big enough to go supernova) but they did a good job of treating the story with a proper 'There will be no survivors' attitude an exploding sun would cause.  The acting is pretty good while the effects are pretty lame considering what else Hallmark has created.  Was the escaped killer sub-plot necessary?  Probably not as such but it created more tension and stress for Perry.  Other than calling the event a supernova there was a commitment to avoid science and scientific terminology for most of the story (makes it hard to pick holes in).  For a disaster film this is better than the recent made-for-TV earthquake and storm films but not as well done as say The Day After Tomorrow.  Check it out.",1169164800,5,1873,4.790625
2449370,2,B000BYY0UG,"This movie seemed to have some potential for science fiction, but got lost somewhere with all the subplots that had really nothing to do with what was really going on.  The worst part was how the Earth was saved...The whole thing was a mistake...A math error made by our hero.  I thought about it and decided that the hero was actually responsible for millions of deaths.  If his math had been right, then maybe world governments could have built shelters or somethings instead of just trying to keep things quiet.  Of course, since it was the hero the writers just skipped over his mistake hurting anyone and everyone just made happy that it was only a mistake in addition.  Huh?  Also, there is the issue of Emma Samms.  When casting someone as a hard boiled maverick reporter, the first name that comes to mind is not Emma Samms.  In fact on that list of potential actors or actresses to play a hard-boiled maverick reporter, Emma is probably not in the top thousand.  That said, she did play the part sincerely if not convincingly.  Perhaps too this is one of those rare films that would be better with the commercials.  Definately a broadcast TV event.  I really can't think of any reason to watch it though.",1154044800,3,1213,4.590697674418605
2449371,2,B000BYY0UG,"Supernova doesn't seem to quite know what it's trying to be and as a result never quite succeeds on any level.  As a disaster epic, it can never quite match the visuals of big screen offerings that have dealt out similar levels of global destruction.  The sequences of the sun's increasing activity are pretty enough to look at but never convince and feel disconnected from the rest of the action.  And scenes of the Eiffel Tower, Taj Mahal and Sydney Opera House being destroyed by giant fireballs descending from the sky are largely unnecessary, only further detracting from the believability of the whole endeavour with some average at best effects work.  It's at its best when it presents the aftermath of the effects of the sun's activity on a smaller scale, emphasising the human drama amongst the chaos that ensues.

The science behind the storyline seems rather shaky at best, as evidenced by a key scene involving a piece of elementary and unconvincing mathematics.  This could, however, be overlooked if the treatment of the scenario of a sun about to consume our solar system was in itself engaging.  Here again, though, Supernova is only a partial success.  The notion of an underground hive intended to ensure mankind's survival if life above ground were to become unsustainable is one of the more interesting themes on offer, and so it's a shame it's never fully explored.  Instead, there are a number of subplots and situations of varying levels of interest.  Of these, Shepard's ruminations on his island retreat are amongst the most poignant as he contemplates his life and work and awaits an end he deems inevitable; his final scene is poorly executed, however, and only detracts from what has gone before.  And the plot surrounding a horribly clichd escaped killer stalking Richardson's family is utterly pointless, providing a ""climax"" more befitting of a conventional thriller.  Perhaps this sought to play safe and provide a recognisable climactic conflict for one of its protagonists, but at this point the movie seems to forget its own premise altogether.

In a variable cast, it is really only the ever-excellent Lance Henriksen who shines, lending sympathy and believable motivation in limited screen time to a character that might very easily have seemed one-dimensional.  Luke Perry seems oddly miscast as Dr Richardson and never convinces the viewer of his academic credentials, and neither is his bond to the rest of his family ever properly established.  This rendered their subplot all the more uninteresting.  Overall, this is an entirely watchable Apocalyptic TV movie so long as you don't think too deeply about it or watch too closely.  For the most part, though, it feels like a missed opportunity that could have taken much bolder decisions and been far more affecting as result.  Lukewarm at best.

2449372,3,B000BYY0UG,"SUPERNOVA is a tv miniseries that runs at almost three hours, and it's a case of less would have been more.  The script by Steve Berman is so overloaded with extemporaneous subplots that the focus from the imminent disaster gets sidetracked a little too often.  The whole thing with Luke Perry's wife witnessing a serial killer and then her testimony sending him to the death penalty is wholly unnecessary.  Anyway, the main plot deals with an impending supernova discovered by brilliant scientist Peter Fonda, based on Perry's calculations.  When all the predictions start occurring (migratory patterns change, telecommunications and blackouts, etc.), seems like the earth's goose is cooked.  Disaster flick fans should be pleased with the decimation of such cities as St. Louis, Paris, Syndey and the Taj Mahal, and the computer generated effects of the sun's eruptions is visually beautiful if unrealistic.  Of course, the nasty government gets involved with Tia Carrere as a Security Agent who whisks Perry and other scientists off in an attempt to prove or disprove Fonda's findings.  Lance Henriksen struts his villainous stuff as a man who will be responsible for deciding who will live in underground facilities to repopulate the earth after the disaster, and Emma Samms is the maverick crusading reporter who is determined to let the public know the truth.  The resolution of the supernova is kind of ridiculous, and the movie's climax focuses on the serial killer.  All in all, it's not horrible, but it fails to give us what disaster movies should:  impending doom for people we care or don't care about and this is where SUPERNOVA fizzles.",1137283200,21,1651,5.104089219330855

2449401,2,B000BYY0UG,"Less would have been much, much more for this TV short series - at nearly 3-hours it's ridiculously unnecessarily long. The filler, side-story involving the killer convict on the loose coming after the ""hero's"" (Luke Perry) family was not only silly, but really took away from what could have been a decent disaster flick. The main story is decent, but again could have been trimmed down to 90 minutes and would have been much better. Decent special effects and acting, but unless you are a fan of Luke Perry (I'm not) or Tia Carrere (she's too old now) there simply is no reason to watch this one. This one isn't even ""good bad"" - it's just slow-paced and lifeless during most of its 3-hour run. Did I mention it was too long?!

2449432,1,B000BYY0UG,"I have often (and happily even) lowered the ""how-good-it-has-to-be"" bar to accommodate my undying desire to watch disaster flicks.  In order to endure the first hour of this one, I had to bury it.  It's gone still, in fact.  I have never seen nor even IMAGINED a film as boring as this one.  The story was ridiculously dull--it couldn't even manage to be funny for its sheer stupidity factor.  It really was, just...boring.  It's basically a movie about people running around trying to decide if there's a solar crisis or not.  Lots of trips to the pc, a completely unrelated cutscene subplot with a convict escaping his transport only to without reason kill the transport driver and his partner.  I remember looking over at the other people watching it with me and asking.. ""For real?  We just left the solar 'let's-watch-and-see-what-happens-to-the-sun-pc-central-room' to see some psycho kill people?  And this relates to this disaster how?""  Good grief just remembering it makes me want to yawn or pull my hair out and since Rapunzel I'm not... I'll settle for the yawn.  If you want to see a truly stupid freakin' movie... watch ""Troll 2""... that'll mess your cerebral function up for awhile but at least you'll get a chuckle from the sheer idiocy of it.  This one tho?  I wouldn't.  Really.  Even stupid would have been better than this sleepfest.",1323216000,2,1353,4.868421052631579
2449433,3,B000BYY0UG,"The premise, only one man on earth (Peter Fonda) thinks he knows what's going on....that the sun is about to go the supernova route....so he goes on the lam.  Why?  Perhaps to avoid the crusty agent of sorts (Tia Carrere), who sets about systematically kidnapping scientists (when she's not getting them killed that is).  Why?  Some sort of crazy plot, led by the master of loonies himself, Lance Henriksen, to get all the worthwhile people in one of several locations so they can repopulate the world after the crisis is over.  I guess he really didn't understand the supernova part but then as a military man, they never do.
A lot of handcuffing takes place, they do manage to deliver a few scenes of destruction that aren't terrible, and we get lots of extreme shots of the sun looking like a funky Christmas ornament (now that's something Hallmark could have put in their stores.  I would have bought one).
Oh yeah, there's also this thing about a kill crazy maniac with bad teeth who escapes from a prison van and goes a-hunting for scientist Luke Perry's wife and daughter.  And for old time sake, Emma Samms pops in as a news reporter hot on the trail of a story she's not supposed to cover.

My first impression, I don't quite see Luke Perry as the scientist type.
Second impression, this actually isn't that bad.  Weird, yes, but not total crap.  It held my interest throughout, even though half of it was a sci-fi flick, the other half a stalker revenge flick.  The two really didn't gel; it felt like someone kept flipping the channels on me.

I've seen worse.  I've also seen a lot better.  In any regard, it's a onetime viewing for me; I don't plan on ever watching it again.",1311811200,,1688,4.546357615894039
2449434,4,B000BYY0UG,"Peter Fonda, Tia Carrera, Emma Samms and Luke Perry team up to save the world from our exploding sun! Whew! Well as long as it's THOSE guys on the job, I'm not worried! Made for the Hallmark Channel this one is short on good FX and a bit long on padding. Actually, padding is mostly what you get. There's a story about a serial killer and then the guy who is supposed to save the world is also very concerned about attending his daughter's musical recital. There is also a government conspiracy to keep the public from learning about our impending doom, which was the only part of this magnificent opus that rang remotely true. It's readily obvious that this was stretched and strung out in order to fill 2 slots in Hallmark's programming schedule.

  There's been alot of talk about how scientifically inaccurate this movie is and I have to say I found that endearing. It's about as scientifically accurate as an episode of Gilligan's Island. But neither this movie nor Gilligan are documentaries. They're just meant to entertain. The same applies to all the other inaccuracies, such as the fact that most of the Australians speak with American accents, the fact that Australia doesn't have the death penalty (an important plot point) and the license plate debacle.  There's also a futile attempt by the characters to escape the explosion of the sun by hiding in tunnels deep underground(with alot of dry ice) and then coming back up to the surface and building a ""new sun"" once that little ""exploding star"" thing blows over. Like there would even be an atmosphere(or a planet) left  after all that. But once again, it's not a NASA training film. This is just a quickie made for TV movie and it need only entertain.

  The problem here is that unless you're a fan of really bad movies, movies that blatantly and callously insult the intelligence and taste of all who watch it, then you probably won't like this movie at all. You may even throw a shoe at the TV screen just out of spite. But if you're like me, and you do find that type of movie amusing, then it's fun. It fondly reminds me of those end-of-the-world movies from the 50's and 60's like When Worlds Collide and The Day the Earth Caught Fire.

 If you have several friends who like to get together and rip on terrible films, then it might even make for a fun party movie, assuming your keg or wine cellar doesn't run dry.",1296000000,,2385,4.56440281030445
2449435,4,B000BYY0UG,"I'm watching the end of this movie at the same time I'm typing the review. The movie was exceptionally good for it's almost three hours, some parts are kinda hard to follow. Some of the movie fails to explain itself. Why would a serial killer be stalking a certain family just to murder them from the time of his really bizarre escape? He doesn't succeed, but sinks to a watery death at the lake of the family hideout after a brief struggle.
And the theory that our sun would soon expand big enough to fill the entire solar system? You see cities getting destroyed. Tokyo has a mass power failure, St. Louis is almost wiped off the map, the Taj Mahal crumples, Paris has a bizarre electric storm which causes little, if any, damage, and Sydney is hurt pretty bad. Riots are going off all over the world, and then VOILA! The moment some of our scientists discover that the end-of-the-world theory is off by a mathematical equation, the sun seems to stop fritzing out. The rain begins to fall again, and everyone's happy. But I didn't understand that with this notion that the apocalypse theory was wrong, how come the sun was sending out all this destruction in the first place? Did the sun decide one day to start PMSing for a week, then calm down into it's regular rotation again?

Despite these questions having to be asked, it was all-in-all, a pretty good movie. Too bad there were no special features offered with the entire DVD, but the actors and actresses did a pretty good job.",1295395200,,1486,4.544776119402985

2449437,4,B000BYY0UG,"Sure, you can find lots of little mistakes and problems with this story, and the special effects tend to be on the cheesy side, but I certainly enjoyed watching Supernova.  I don't really associate Hallmark Entertainment with disaster movies, but they certainly did a credible job with this one.  Not surprisingly, there are a few overly melodramatic moments and one incredibly unnecessary subplot, but these family entertainment guys didn't shirk from blowing a lot of things up, including the Taj Mahal and all of a major American city.  With a total runtime of almost three hours, some may find Supernova a little too long, but one must keep in mind the fact that this originally aired as a two-part television miniseries.

Things don't look very good for the Earth and everything on it.  Apparently, our sun is much older than scientists thought, and Dr. Austin Shepard (Peter Fonda) has discovered that it is about to go supernova.  Unprecedented sunspot activity will wreak havoc with Earth's communications systems, followed by huge releases of plasma from the sun's inner depths that will rain fireballs down upon the Earth; soon thereafter, the sun will expand to the point that it consumes the entire Solar System and then explode.  It's the ultimate mass extinction event.  Knowing there is nothing that can be done, Austin emails his findings to five illustrious colleagues and flies off to find himself a beach bunny and enjoy the last few days of life as we know it.  Austin's junior colleague, Dr. Chris Richardson (Luke Perry) soon finds himself at the very nexus of activity, commandeered by intelligence agent Lisa Delgado (Tia Carrere) at the bidding of a high-ranking U.S. colonel (Lance Henriksen) even before he knows what is going on.  Already well aware of Dr. Shepard's apocalyptic conclusions, America and other world governments have activated a long-secret plan to gather worthy individuals to be evacuated to underground cities.  The public at large, of course, must not be told about the imminent catastrophe the angry sun is sending their way.  Meanwhile, as if the whole destruction of the Solar System isn't quite dramatic enough by itself, we have a far-fetched and wholly unnecessary subplot about Dr. Richardson's wife and daughter being stalked by the escaped serial killer that Mrs. Richardson's testimony helped convict in the first place.

There are, of course, a number of other characters with stories of their own, but a lot of the focus of this film, apart from the scenes of wholesale destruction, revolves around the plan to try and save a remnant of civilization for any possible future.  Dr. Richardson in particular openly rebels at this idea, and I really don't understand why.  If there is any chance for mankind to survive the coming upheaval, why not go for it?  Yes, it's unfortunate that only a select few would qualify and that whoever made the selections would essentially be playing God, but isn't that better than sitting back and letting everyone on the planet die a certain death together?  Another key theme is the public's right to know.  We all know what happens when mankind faces even a local disaster - massive looting, violent protests, mayhem in the streets, etc.  Should the people of Earth really be told they are all about to die?

Maybe you're wondering how scientists could possibly come up with a way to stop the sun from exploding.  Stop wondering because there is no way to do that.  Mankind's only hope is that the brilliant Dr. Austin made a mistake somewhere in his calculations.  It wouldn't be the only mistake in this movie - take, for instance, the fact that serial killer Grant Cole is sentenced to death in a country (Australia) that does not have the death penalty, or the fact that no character in this Australian setting seems to speak with an Australian accent.  This whole story actually lends itself exceedingly well to any number of ""things I learned from this movie"" lists.  Go and check some of them out on the Internet - they're pretty darn funny.  As for the special effects, keep in mind that this was a television mini-series, not a Hollywood summer blockbuster - the effects may not be very realistic, but I figure the filmmakers did the best they could with what they had to work with.

All criticisms aside, though, I did enjoy this movie quite a bit.  Luke Perry isn't bad in the main role, Tia Carrere more than holds her on, and Lance Henriksen brings an effective sense of gravitas to the whole story.  Even Peter Fonda was good (I usually try to avoid any and all Fondas not named Bridget).  Finally, as a serious fan of science fiction and disaster films, I can't ask for much more than the idea of our sun freaking exploding.  For a production that originally aired on the Hallmark Channel, Supernova really isn't bad at all.",1273104000,2,4834,4.851400730816078
2449457,4,B000BYY0UG,"Supernova is not just another disaster- or `end of the world'-story which of so many have been released during the past decade, following in the footsteps of Deep Impact and Armageddon. Many of these pictures usually go with a top-notch cast of some washed-up actors (here it is: Luke Perry, Peter Fonda, Tia Carrere and - as always - Lance Henriksen). Most of these films have the typical disaster-plotline. Scientist discovers there is something cataclysmic to happen, be it regional or worldwide. No one believes him and together with an unexpected and first reluctant sidekick help (always an ex-wife or estranged colleague) he has to work out a plan to save the world. Most of the time it works and the former disengaged twosome reunite. End of story. Together with some spectacular views of fire, quakes, storms or lava another disaster flick is ready for distribution.

Supernova differs from this path. There is of course the scientist (Peter Fonda) who discovered that the sun is about to explode, which will burn the entire planet. But no-one questions his outcomings. Fonda flees to the Maldives while his colleague (Perry) desperately wants to find him. Soon afterwards a journalist who finds out about this Solar Apocalypse is faced with the question to publicize this story or not. Her boss insists not to publish the story, yet unfortunately her footage is leaked on the internet, and many who have seen this are running wild. The government is also in search of Fonda and send agent Carrere to work with Perry. In the meantime Henriksen is working on a plan to bring humanity in shelters.

Apart from this main plot there is a subplot. A convicted serial killer is after Perry's wife and child. This story is an interesting thriller, it does not add anything to the Supernova story. It was better to cut this from the movie.

Some other critical remarks: Fonda should have been given a much larger role than he has here. We only see him in the beginning and when he flies to the Maldives, which in fact are a flat archipelago and have no mountains, unlike shown here. The outcomings of the Supernova are very disappointing, I won't spoil anything here...but you'll see what I mean.

In short, Supernova is an above average disaster movie, because it dwells much less on the usual special effects. The viewer is asked questions on what he would do. Should society be warned that the end is near, while risking a people going crazy? How should you spend your last days on this planet, going nuts and doing everything God has forbidden or partying till you drop?",1262476800,,2575,4.792792792792793

Do we tell?
Who do we tell?
Is there an evil plot to the end?
Will Dr. Austin Sheppard (Peter Fonda) find time enough for love?
Will an evil being abduct Brooke and Haley?
Do we really care?

We get to watch some great acting by Tia Carrere, born on 1967 as Althea Janairo, 11 years after she gained acknowledgement in the blockbuster film ""True Lies"" (1994). And let's not forget Peter Fonda who played Frank in ""The Passion of Ayn Rand"" (1999).",1260489600,2,614,4.3304347826086955

Have to  play part 1 using manual  control.  Have several dvd's that have this problem.  I don't know what the matter is.

2449461,1,B000BYY0UG,"Wow. I am still in awe of just how bad this film was. The screenplay was a confused jumble of intersecting sub-plots, most of which made little, if any, sense. The entire scientific premise of the movie is so ridiculous that it would have to assume that the viewer has an IQ of a geranium in order to believe it. The acting is bad enough to almost be funny. The characters are inept, unlikable and overdramatized. There is a stereotypical, psycho-villain thrown into the plot that is played like something out of a bad 1950's comic book. The effects are... well, like something I could have created myself in a few seconds using Photoshop and a cheap, digital camcorder. The music score is just a bunch of recycled background trash that sounds like something from the cutting room floor of an adult movie. If this film had a director, he should rethink his choice of careers. Any director with a sense of decency would have burned this film before it had a chance to be developed. Even Ed Wood's movies are more realistic and certainly more enjoyable by comparison. I've seen a lot of bad films in my day, and I can usually find at least one thing about each of them that I enjoyed, or at least believed. Not so, with Supernova. A more fitting title would have been ""Black Hole"", since that's where it seemed like my time had gone after watching this trainwreck of a movie.",1253145600,9,1373,4.518072289156627

2449463,4,B000BYY0UG,"As with all the movies I like to deem earth thrillers, along with other such titles, I highly recommend this movie, as they give us a fresh, new look at how our fragile, taken-for-granted eco-system could come to a screeching halt. I'm not a tree hugger, or any other title people like to call themselves, but just one who is open to new ideas on the demise of mankind, and life on earth. To take this concept to the level of natural correction, or celestial control adds the excitement of being out of man's control to make things right. This movie does a great job of that, and I think the only anticlimax in the whole movie, is the discovery of a wrong formula, which, oddly enough calls the forces of our solar giant into rein. The possibilities for an alternative ending are few, but this one would have never ocurred. Beside that, I thought it was a fantastic story.",1245110400,,872,4.45625
2449464,4,B000BYY0UG,"I'm writing this mostly to correct the impression given by a reviewer that this blu ray disc does not contain the entire miniseries.  It certainly does contain both parts in their entirety.  After watching part one the credits role and then part two starts automatically.  It can also be accessed from the pop up  menu at any time.  The film itself is pretty good although a bit slow. There are too many characters to keep track of and the film would have been better if half an hour were edited out. IT also suffers a bit of an identity crisis.  Is it science fiction or a serial killer stalker movie?  It trys to be both with mixed results. Nice to see Luke Perry in the lead role.  He does a fine job with this.  Visual effects are fairly impressive CGI stuff.  The transfer looks excellent and often almost three dimmensional. Colors are beautiul and vivid.  There is some minor dirt on the print in two scenes but other than that it looks awesome.  Sound is excellent uncompressed 5.1  There are interviews with the director, John Harrison and all of the cast. A trailer is also included. For such a bargain basement price, they did a very nice job with this Blu ray release. And once again, THE DISC DOES CONTAIN THE COMPLETE FILM.",1241913600,24,1237,4.493273542600897
