8508911,4,B0072H60VM,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching this, as I was on an international flight and it was one the few movie choices that appealed to me.

It was sad but very enjoyable at the same time - had me bawling my eyes out at the end.",1359504000,,241,3.82
8508912,5,B0072H60VM,"I saw this movie by chance while on a trip to Singapore from Chicago. If you have made this trip, you'll know how long and boring it is. The movie was the last one I had not seen on the flight as it is in Japanese with English subtitles. As it turned out, the movie is very touching (and yes I did shed a tear or two while on the plane)... little did I know at the time, how close to home it would hit 3 months after viewing it.
The acting seemed very real and drew me in quickly. The plot and storyline is solid and doesn't dwell on extraneous events. After reading other reviews when returning to the states, to give too much detail only hurts the viewing experience of the movie. To compare it to American movies, is difficult. It's like a mix of Titanic, Ghost, and On Golden Pond wrapped into one humorous and  very dramatic movie.
I have been searching for this movie in the states for about 6 months and it has yet to appear officially in DVD or Digital formats. The ones I find are bad quality illegal copies or have Region code 3, needs to be Region code 1 to play in the states.
This a must see movie, you won't be disappointed!",1336867200,,1138,4.149321266968326
