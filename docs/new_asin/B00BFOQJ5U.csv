8567819,2,B00BFOQJ5U,"Watched this DVD set last night, and as a frequent buyer of UFC DVDs, I have to say this is one of the worst sets of fights that I have seen in a long time.  I found all the fights real yawn-fests except for Burrel vs. Villefort and Rousey vs. Carmouche.  Both those fights were quite entertaining.  Not to come off as a sexist, but I was very leery about seeing women fight in the UFC.  I guess, as a guy, I instinctively want to see women safe and not getting their faces smashed-in in a brutal combat sport.  But Rousey and Carmouche changed my mind.  Both are such awesome athletes, and were so game, and put on such an amazing fight... that I guess I wasn't looking upon them as just women, but rather viewing them as incredible MMA fighters.  So serious props to them.

I do want to echo some of the other reviewers' complaints about the lack of DVD extras.  Given that it was the debut women's fight in the UFC, I was looking forward to seeing a lot of specials and behind-the-scenes on Rousey and Carmouche.  Unfortunately, there's hardly any, and virtually nothing on Rousey.  So that, along with mostly boring fights, scores this DVD set just 2 stars.",1374364800,3,1161,4.403755868544601
8567820,5,B00BFOQJ5U,"Although there are no behind the scenes clips, this DVD has plenty of what UFC fans are looking for, great fights with exciting finishes. Regardless of the quality of the fights, UFC 157 was destined to be a historic event. Fortunately, the main event more than lived up to the hype, as did several of the undercard fights. Don't skip Lawler vs. Koscheck or Faber vs. Menjivar. McGee vs. Neer also serves up some real excitement. Can't wait for the Rousey vs. Carmouche rematch!",1371427200,,478,4.7023809523809526
8567821,1,B00BFOQJ5U,"Once again the UFC has found a way to make itself even more of a shell of the product it once was.

Paper-thin, watered-down cards, the proliferation of point fighting, non-competitive main events that have no business even being sold to the general public as main-event quality fights...as if all this wasn't bad enough, Zuffa has apparently decided to try and save a few bucks on their dvd productions by no longer including a behind-the-scenes featurette in the bonus features section. It's really pretty pathetic when you think about it. Most, if not all of the fights can be viewed online (winks at Dana), which leaves little or no reason to buy the dvds unless you're some sort of blind-devotion, Zuffa shilling fanboy who has too much money to burn.

Not only will the UFC not become the biggest sports organization in the world in ten years, but I predict that it may actually be out of business in ten years if this trend continues.

Don't let them make a fool of you by purchasing dvds that are increasingly  suck-filled pieces of you know what.

overall pretty good paper-view but was hoping for behind the scenes and this is the first time they don't add countdown in a single ufc event. hope the other bonus material are worth it for takeing out the countdown and behind the scenes.",1366416000,5,872,5.086956521739131
8567823,3,B00BFOQJ5U,"UFC 157 was an event in time that will long be remembered for its best reasons.  First off, UFC had its first women's fight and to boot they made it the headlining fight of the night.  Let's face it, some fans may have been suspicious but think back to when EliteXC has its ""Destiny"" event (wow, feels like a long time ago now) and Gina Carano fought Julie Kedzie on the main card.  So many fans were worried about a women's fight then and look at history now, that event isn't remembered mostly for the fights by the men on the card, it's remembered for the Carano/Kedzie fight which was fireworks.  Now, it was UFC's turn at making history and in a big way.

Robbie Lawler was making his UFC return after being away for over 8 years.  Those of us that can remember him can recall a Welterweight who had absolute dynamite in his hands but his time in the UFC ended after two defeats.  He's kept busy since leaving fighting in the other organizations but most fans today will remember him for his time in Strikeforce as a Middleweight.  Now he's coming back with the absorption of the Strikeforce roster.  His welcoming party comes in the form of UFC veteran Josh Koscheck.  An ""Ultimate Fighter"" alumni Josh is a dangerous wrestler with some absolutely nasty power in his hands but he hasn't fought since last May in his split decision loss to Johny Hendricks.  So, with both fighters looking to leave an impression on this night how would the fight play out?  Well, it came down to one fighter's sense of fighting actually being a gateway to the end.  A majority of the fight is pretty tame before the ending when an extremely quick finish occurs.  Now, most people are probably going to be suspicious of the ending (count me among them) but I guess we'll never know if it was the proper call.  Feels kinda filler until the end, where you're kinda left to your personal feelings which may be a good thing or bad thing.

Next up was Court McGee, another ""Ultimate Fighter"" alumni, making his Welterweight debut against Josh Neer.  McGee had some pretty good performances at Middleweight but after two losses (the second is HIGHLY questionable) he made the drop in weight.  There to greet him was Josh Neer, ""The Dentist"".  He's on his third UFC run and while it started out strong his last two fights have ended up way of two first round finishes.  So, with both men in need of a win I thought the fight would be the kind of impression maker these situations turn out.  I wasn't wrong in a way.  The victor put on what was probably his best performance in the octagon but he was unable to finish his opponent.  Beyond a fairly close second round the entire fight seemed rather one-sided.  If you're a fan of sound technical fights this should appeal to you but be aware that the first round is really where the fight finds its main rhythm so don't get too sad when you don't get that exclamation point of a finish.

Next up is a rematch from 2006.  Urijah Faber takes on Ivan Menjivar in a fight that ended due to disqualification.  It's my personal belief that these fights make for some of the best rematches because there are always those lingering questions of ""Who would have eventually won?"" or the classic ""WTF!?  What happens now!?"" (I have this when someone gets screwed in a judges decision or a draw).  Either way, there are lingering questions when fights end like this so both fighters are typically motivated and out to prove a point when it comes time for the rematch.  Now, I'm not sure how the first fight played out but this one is rather one-sided, with a bit of action to start off before cruise control sets in.  The fight ends in the first round, and unlike the first fight, it is an awesome finish.  Definitely the first fight on the main card that's worth checking out.

In the co-main event I'll admit that I was worried.  Lyoto Machida and Dan Henderson were paired up to decide the next contender for the Light Heavyweight championship (depending on who holds that title depends on who wins between Jones and Sonnen in April).  Now, I'm a fan of both men but I am willing to recognize the positives and negatives to this kind of fight.  First off, Machida is an unusual fighter for most people because while he is highly accurate and successful his styles makes for a game of ""catch-me"" for the most part.  He's such a strong counter fighter and most fighters are stupid enough to play this game with him.  Not typically something that ends well.  Henderson is a living legend but at the same time he has the years and experience to demonstrate that somehow age doesn't always mean what it's cracked up to be (ala Randy Couture).  He has a tendency for pretty exciting fights when people are willing to exchange with him, only he's got arguably the best right hand in the business (in terms of pure destructive power) so this list is typically pretty short.  So, matching two guys together with one being a counter fight and the other being a wrestler whose stand up isn't the fastest, nor is it centered around chasing a guy down, the result looked to be a bit scary.  Unfortunately for my personal tastes, a lot of things went how I thought they would.  While this revealed a good game plan and effective use of that strategy for the victory the fight was difficult to watch.  I had a number of moments sitting in my seat that I couldn't help but want to move around just to see more activity of any kind but that's more a reflection of my personal feelings than the actual fight's vibe.  The victor did what he had to and the loser just didn't seem to have the tools to effectively neutralize that but to sum it up: don't watch this fight unless you're a heavy fan of both men or just willing to watch a campfire (opposite of a barn burner) fight.

Here it is, I was worried (for multiple reasons) about the inclusion of a women's division in the UFC.  The idea came about years ago when fighters like Gina Carano and Cris Cyborg had yet to be paired up and were still being talked as an idea.  Back then the division of women was pretty thin, most I hadn't heard of before, and the fights didn't always stand out in any particular way.  But Strikeforce slowly developed a pretty decent talent pool of women and that led to an actual division worth talking about.  Ronda Rousey was a quiet thing at first but it was right around the time she was challenging for the Strikeforce title did she start garnering attention.  As a Judo practitioner she's damn impressive and that goes beyond talks of sex.  Her mother carved a legacy that was quickly followed up in the same way.  Lo and behold, one title win and a title defense later people know her name.  Given that all of her fights have ended in the first round by armbar (has this ever happened before?)  most fighters were not looking forward to getting in the ring with her.  That's where Liz Carmouche comes in.  A former marine Carmouche is a women who has a tendency for finishing off her opponents and through some nasty fashion.  As one of the few people who was willing to fight her she gained her title shot against the newly crowned UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion.  Okay, that's enough backstory, on to the fight!  Again, this pay-per-view is going to be remembered for its best parts and this is probably reasons one, two, and three.  The first being the UFC's first women's fight was awesome.  Say what you will about technical skill and pace this fight had an amazing environment.  I truly feel like it's one of those cases where if you weren't into the fight initially you were eventually turned over by the excitement of the people there.  Personally, I loved it and if this fight isn't on the ""Best of"" next year for 2013 (in its ENTIRETY) I'll be pissed.  Second, both fighters looked very strong in this fight.  This was by no means a squash match as some may have thought and I love how well each fighter was able to highlight themselves.  Third, after what felt like a rocky night of fights for this to be the fight to cape off the night I think was definitely an occasion of ""right time, right place"".  Things just fit in a great way for this fight.

As I just mentioned, I feel that this night was a kind of rocky.  Most of the prelims ended by decision and while that's not the worst I just wasn't blown away enough to recommend the prelims overall, with the exception of a really interesting leg lock demonstrated in the third prelim of the night.  The main card had the first fight end oddly and from there, with the exception of the Faber/Mejivar fight and main event, it just never felt all that great.  I'd say your best plan would be to wait for the ""Best of 2013"" set if you're going to get a set that has the Rousey/Carmouche fight but that's just my personal feelings.",1361664000,6,8785,4.463322884012539
