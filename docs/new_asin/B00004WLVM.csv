1365871,5,B00004WLVM,"Although I didn't watch this all the way through, it gave me what I wanted. I can only imagine how controversial this movie was and still is today. A very lucky 12 year old boy lives in a brothel and has sex with the women. What's not to like? They actually show it. They strip in front of him, take his clothes off, and spoon with him. I would love that if it happened to me. I'd definitely recommend LOVE STRANGE LOVE!!!",1350777600,3,422,4.158536585365853

1365873,2,B00004WLVM,"This film totally lacked professionalism from start to finish. The fact that it borders child pornography only by a thin line is no surprise in this poorly made foreign film. The ""voiceovers"" were pathetic. I suspect the boy's voice was done by a girl or young woman and did not match the boy's person at all. The same poor quality applied to all the rest of the characters as well. The incest scene with the boy and his Mother was not the worst part of the film. Other scenes depicted a so-called war or conflict happening or about to happen between two countries or cities of which which I have no clue as to the reason or what countries. This conflict had little or no bearing on the plot of the story. Much of the conservation between the other characters, during a party and other times, made absolutely no sense whatsoever and appeared to be used as ""fill-in"" for the purpose of using up time in the film. NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TIME TO WATCH.....",1339459200,4,957,4.4124293785310735

Hollywood produces hundreds of action/cartoon/fantasy films each year. Look closely and you'll see they all mimic each other. Redundency is key in Hollywood. However if you seek a thinking film, which reaches into your every day life, look to Foreign Films. Here is one called "" Amor Estranho Amor. "" Roughly translated it means, 'Love, Strange Love. ' It's the story of a man, Hugo (adult - Walter Forster) who's returning to the family home he lived in when he was a very young Brazilian preteen boy growing up amid the governmental turmoil of the 1930's. Having been evicted by his Grandmother, he is taken to live in his mother's house, a glamorous, socially exclusive, high class Bordello. While there, Hugo as a child (Marcelo Ribeiro) recalls the two days he spent with his prostitute mother and a bevy of beautiful whores. While a group of political radicals plan the over throw of the government, Hugo is treated to the eye-popping candy delights of his youthful imagination, while his mother warns him of those same pleasures. The movie is stylish, often opulent with respects to the lavish settings, the gorgeous women and most startling with the innocent beauty of the boy and his mother. However, the stagnant dialog and poor acting of the principals leaves much to be desired. Although there is much controversy over the inter-action between the young boy and the lascivious courtesans, there is nothing in the movie to be feared by any save those who lack sophistication. As for those mature enough to accept this masterful art piece for what it is, the writer/director Walter Khouri, his cast Xuxa Meneghel, Tarcisio Meira and Vera Fishcher are to be praised as they have given the world a foreign Classic. Well done.",1324339200,8,1799,4.879084967320262
1365875,2,B00004WLVM,Do yourself a favor and save your money... The movie is boring and the subject matter is considered taboo but you won't see anything it is mostly implied,1316131200,4,153,4.5
1365876,1,B00004WLVM,"Like to see a little boy get fondled by adult women? This is the movie for you.

Want to watch an adult woman take off a little boy's clothes in bed? Again this is the move for you.

Otherwise this movie is gross sexual exploitation of a young boy and a clear example of child pornography.

I would think that Amazon wouldn't want to be the distributor of such child pornography.

1365877,1,B00004WLVM,"This movie became a huge polemic in Brazil because of one of the coadjuvant actors: Xuxa Meneghel, that acted as Tamara. She starred the movie with only 16 years old, and appears nude and in sexual content scenes, which is obvious highly forbidden in Brazil since the fall of the militar dictatorship that still lasted in the 80's. The movie became famous because few years after it was recorded Xuxa became suddenly one of the most famous superstars in Brazil, being the spokesman of a child's show called ""club of Xuxa"". Her relationship with the world-famous football player Pel launched her as the ""Queen of the short ones(ie. kids)"", and a movie where the new brazillian ""queen of the kids"" appears in a sexual relationship with a 12 years old boy became obviously a polemical bomb from the 80's onwards. Xuxa's fame continued throught the next decades when she became one of the most rich persons in Brazil. She forbided the appearance and sell of this movie by all means: buying the movie rights, making arrangements with the producers, law suits, etc. The movie portraits, besides the still unknown Xuxa, also two other actors that were already very famous: Vera Fischer and Tarcsio Meira, what makes it even more bizarre; to see those much prestiged actors in a movie with pedophily, child and teenage pornography content.",1312761600,4,1331,4.893805309734513
1365878,5,B00004WLVM,"An unusual, but quite an interesting film to watch. Certainly one of those rare 'coming of age' stories shown in films that are really worth watching. A story about a man, recollecting days of past, when he was a preteen, recollecting the days when he was introduced to the word 'Sexuality'. A very unique film, but quite impressive. The role played by the boy as 'Hugo' is definately worth watching. A film of memories and moments. Watch it for yourself, you will not be dissapointed. Watch a film through the eyes of a little boy. Definately worth watching.",1240272000,29,559,4.714285714285714
1365879,5,B00004WLVM,"Almost every young man fantasizes of living in a brothel where beautiful women fulfill his curiosity about sex. In this case, a 12-year-old gets the opportunity of a lifetime. The movie starts with the visit of an older man at a mansion where he goes through a series of flashbacks during his tour of the building. Since there is no plot synopsis, the following description is from the DVD cover.
*Set in Brazil, Hugo is sent by his grandmother to live with his mother in a high-class brothel catering to wealthy politicians. The resident girls find young Hugo a refreshing change to the older men they are used to. They flirt with him and attempt to seduce him while his mother tries to protect his innocence. Hugo is flattered by the attention and in his curiosity finds ways to spy on the girls while they are entertaining their clients.
*The boy who portrays Hugo performed well in a very difficult role. Warning: there is a lengthy incest scene at the end of the film.",1210291200,60,973,4.597701149425287

1365885,5,B00004WLVM,"Individuals who view this film should be aware this is a foreign DVD movie, which depicts the culture and society in Brazil.  Xuxa and Vera Fischer portray a very good example of a high priced call girl or consort, who sent her Son to live with a Grandmother. However the Grandmother returns her Grandson with the demand for more finances to take Hugo back.  No doubt this is a luxurious brothel.  Hugo is old enough to commence puberty and with it begins a young boy's discovery of sexuality.  What can be overlooked in viewing this movie, is some
of those who are economically and socially privileged, do send their Sons who start puberty to a luxurious brothel for their first sexual experiences.  Although it seems strange for women to take an sexual interest in a young boy like Hugo and be attracted to his naivete.  But Hugo's curiosity leads him to explore what goes on around him and he has erotic fantasies ... and acts on those desires.  Of course some of the young girls are only too willing to help him adjust.  But Hugo's Mother has a choice to make - and she chooses the luxurious lifestyle of
a call girl/consort; Hugo is sent back to his Grandmother after a long scene of incestuous sexual intercourse with his Mother.  In the course of the DVD movie, the view observes Hugo as an adult who has a serious of ""flashbacks"" to the past when he was a boy at the brothel and obviously was sent back to his Grandmother's care to grow up.  This movie is a masterpiece of South American television in a country like
Brazil with realistic presentations of certain cultural aspects.  Caution is the right term for any viewer to be aware foreign countries have their own cultures and societies which can be very volatile and unstable. This foreign film covers all the aspects with brilliance.",1407801600,10,1798,4.605015673981192
1365886,4,B00004WLVM,"First of all, I have to make this very clear to anyone that is interested in buying this DVD; this is not child-pornography as one reviewer falsely claims! I am someone who would very much love nothing more than to see pedophiles, child-pornographers, and all associated ""sickos"" disappear from the face of the earth!! This film simply deals with the ""rites of passage"" of a 12 year old boy and nothing more. In ""Amor estranho amor"" (""Love, Strange Love"" from 1982 and directed by Walter Hugo Khouri), 'Hugo' (Walter Forster) returns to the sumptuous palatial-mansion (which was an exclusive brothel for High Society), that when as a child in 1937 was left there for several days. His stay there has marked him for life. This return and journey was a way for him to reminisce/reconcile that part of his life. His mother 'Anna' (Vera Fischer) lived and worked in the brothel, and was a favorite of an elitist 'Dr. Osmar' (Tarcisio Meira) who was an obvious fascist, and was planning a ""coup d'tat"" along with his fellow co-conspirators. In his short stay there, 'Hugo' witnessed and was exposed to the overt sexual-activity and intrigue of the adults, and was almost seduced and initiated by two of the beautiful women of the brothel (Matilde Mastrangi and Xuxa Meneghel). However, his innocence was ultimately taken away by something else altogether.

Now, if one examines this lost curiosity a little closer, what can one learn? Many of the Brazilian films of the late 70's and early 80's were a mix of soft-core (like in this case) and hardcore erotica, that were trying to mask political criticism aimed at the military dictatorship of the time. The erotic themes were a way to guarantee a decent box-office return, and were almost always expected, this film was no different. Now, ""Amor estranho amor"" is not an outright great film, but it did offer and handle the story of the sexual-awakening (and corruption, if you will) of a 12 year old boy; with maturity, sensitivity, and artistic integrity that was free of the hang-ups and hypocrisy that Hollywood is famous for. And the production-values were very good here. The film featured full-frontal nudity from the women (especially one Matilde Mastrangi, which is the real reason I had to have this ""objet d'art""), but at no time is the young actor (Marcelo Ribeiro) ever shown fully nude, or did it cross the line in any way. As a matter of fact, in some scenes, it was even clear that a body-double was used in place of the boy. And, the story is probably autobiographical and very similar to that of the ""The Go-Between"" (1970). That film however, is a real masterpiece. Not as strange as the title implies, yet unconventional and controversial all the same. The cast: Vera Fischer, Tarcisio Meira, Xuxa Meneghel, Iris Bruzzi, Walter Forster, Marcelo Ribeiro, Mauro Mendona, Matilde Mastrangi, etc.

The DVD picture and sound quality by New Star Video is excellent, the film has been fully-restored. My only gripe, it's not in its original Portuguese but in dubbed English (the voices sound cartoonish and hampers this release). NTSC, English (dubbed), no English subtitles, NR 120 mins.

1365889,5,B00004WLVM,"The DVD was with English dubbing, which was different from my expectation ( I prefer subtitles with original dialogue) and although the production is from a long time ago, the picture and sound qualitiy was good enough to enjoy the movie.
As a movie, I know this is not everyone's cup of tea and infact some might look down on this, but I consider it a work of art and just so it needs to be appreciated with an eye for beauty and innocence.
I remember seeing this movie about 15 years ago in B/W but had missed the title and had it always in my memories. It was just now I could trace it and enjoy on a full HD colour screen.

1365890,4,B00004WLVM,"This is indeed a strange movie. The much older Hugo has returned to the house where his mother worked and remembers the short time he spent there when he was around 12 or 13 years old. Young Hugo had been living with his grandmother but she took him to the high class brothel where his mother works, and left him there. His mother has no way to avoid letting him spend the night. This happens during a period of great political unrest in the country and the brothel is right in the middle of one powerful man's political dealings. Not only does the  boy witness extensive nudity and sex, but one of the younger prostitutes makes very aggressive moves towards Hugo. It is not clear if the youngster actually has sex, but if he does it is not with the person you expect.
The acting is not the best, especially in the longer dialogue scenes, but I have seen worse. The movie is not predictable, and therefore is not boring from that stand point, not that it would be that easy to get bored just from the young beautiful prostitutes running around scantly clad or nude. The boy and some of the men are also seen nude, but not full frontal nudity like the women are.",1375228800,4,1161,4.375
