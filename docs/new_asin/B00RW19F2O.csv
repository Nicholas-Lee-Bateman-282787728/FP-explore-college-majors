6935979,5,B00RW19F2O,"It's safe to say this film didn't have a huge budget. Nor did it have any name actors. Or ridiculous CGI special effects. It's not going to win any Academy Awards or change how you look at filmmaking for the rest of your life.  However, when you look at what this group of filmmakers did with what they had, it's quite the accomplishment. The film overall is for the most part solidly put together. The group of pretty much unknown actors give it their all. They perform well as an ensemble, and they are up there acting, not for a huge paycheck I gather, but rather they're on screen because of the love of it. My favorite character is the unsung hero, Victor, played by Colin Ward. What I like here is that there aren't the stereotypical good and bad guys. It's more complex than that. Like in Walking Dead, survivalism creates a whole different level of conflict that is both internal and external for each and every character. You can follow each of them in this story and may not agree with their actions, but you can understand why they do what they do. It's also safe to say that for a low budget indie, the production value is pretty darn good. The cinematography is convincing to be on par with much bigger productions. The sound and score also stand out to be on the higher end of what a small production can pull off. There's a lot of levels to the sound design that really establish the world they're in, as well as a surprisingly epic sounding score for such a small production. You can go on TV at any time on SyFy and see some really awful content that insults your intelligence that delivers much worse story, acting, and horrible effects. At least these guys knew their limits and didn't try to put in a horribly animated 6' spider or rewrite the laws of physics with the idea of sharks flying around in tornados.  They were attempting to give something more, and I believe they have done just that. Overall I give it a B, but I give them an A+ for their efforts.",1426204800,6,1980,4.392370572207084
6935980,2,B00RW19F2O,"The film opens like a Chines fire drill as ""White Agent"" is released from the Hawthorn Wallis defense contractor plant. The camera jerks around, objects go in and out of focus and fonts have a blank line cut through the middle of them. We know this is serious stuff. We then move to a secure Hawthorn Wallis plant where Eli (Michael A. Tushaus) and Cho (Heung Wong) are working on a ""cure"" and practicing their lines. Cho speaks some lines in Chinese to a guy with Star Trek collar insignias over the Internet. I guess he is some kind of spy, no subscripts. Survivors from the White Agent release are irate as their lungs fill up with liquid and they die...""They killed my Auntie!"" Whoops wrong film.

The film centers on two characters and most of the action takes place in one facility. The acting...well there was one scene that wasn't too bad. I couldn't feel the intensity as they used a generic sound track and bad dialogue to make us feel intensity. On the plus side they never used a voice enhancer, the scenes were centered and I never recalled seeing a microphone. The sound never cut in and out either so in many ways this was superior in quality to a lot of low budget indie messes out there that look like High School projects. However, It wasn't entertaining to watch two guys who can't act run around a concrete building for half the film.

No swearing, sex, or nudity. Minor blood and violence.",1425081600,,1410,4.50390625

6936008,2,B00RW19F2O,"This is a very bad movie with terrible writing poor directing and mediocre acting. However if you are a melodrama lack of intelligence junky you might like it. The plot in a nutshell... deadly toxin kills ppl the few survivors find the only ones who can cure them and decide to kill them instead.  At the end 1 scientist and 2 cured victims somehow make it out of quarantine zone and a 45 second ending to tidy up the stinky writing, directing and acting. This was rated at 4 stars when I watched it and will take months of honest reviews to sink it to the stinky bottom where this turd of a movie belongs.",1469318400,9,606,4.269565217391304

6936010,2,B00RW19F2O,"The acting is pretty bad and the progression is weak given the potential for an interesting story. This could have been reduced to a 22 minute TV episode. I suppose actors and directors have to start someplace, this is far, far, below B-movie material.",1469145600,7,252,4.75
6936011,4,B00RW19F2O,"I watched the entire movie, which is saying a lot when it comes to indie movies. I won't tell anything about the plot because you get the gist of it from the trailer.

For a bunch of unknown actors, this is actually pretty well done. It wasn't too over-acted in a way that distracted me horribly and that frequently comes from indie movies. Cinematography is on point. Edited well and nothing in continuity was off (or it wasn't obvious if it was ""off""). The dialogue and lack of dialogue is rather believable. Some of the CGI stuff is obviously low-budget, but it's also better than what I see in a lot of low-budget indies. The sound is top-notch. The fact the actor who plays the lead male ""Dr. Eli"" / Michael A. Tushaus is ALSO the composer is quite impressive. The only thing I had difficulty with was reading the subtitles in a few spots during the Chinese dialogue.

This is worth watching! I actually had to watch the last two minutes of the story twice because the twist had me saying: ""Wait. What? Oh DAMN!"" I look forward too seeing more stories from Kelly Schwarze. I appreciate the fact there was little or no profanities, no nudity or gore, which seems to be the standard in so much of what is labeled 'entertainment' these days.

I gave 4 stars because my mind drifted off for a minute (or two) at one point in the second half and the acting could have been a little more believable for a story of this genre and content.",1468713600,,1436,4.411320754716981
