2491713,5,B000E5MI0Q,This is a standard movie in our household for Easter. Great music that really movies little ones and adults. Great way to tell the Easter story for young ones.,1427241600,,159,4.517241379310345
2491714,5,B000E5MI0Q,"I teach in a Catholic school and it's often difficult to find good, religious-themed holiday videos, especially Easter ones.  My students enjoyed this immensely.",1402963200,,161,5.708333333333333
2491715,5,B000E5MI0Q,I purchased this DVD  for K-3 to view before Easter.  The Easter Promise - I'll show to K-3. It retells the story of Jesus without being scary.  The Witness - I won't use for Kindergarten because I don't think it will hold their attention.  For The Witness students should be familiar with at least some stories of Jesus in order to appreciate the video.,1396137600,,354,4.484375
2491716,5,B000E5MI0Q,"My children are 9 and 11 years old, and absolutely loved this movie. By inserting children into the Easter story, they felt instantly engaged in the story.",1369180800,,155,4.777777777777778
2491717,4,B000E5MI0Q,"This DVD features 2 short movies related to the Biblical events regarding Easter.  They are both fictitious but are nice spin off ideas from the original scripture.  One story is about a little boy who helps the Pharisees but eventually realizes his error and comes to believe in the miracle of Jesus.  The other story is about Barabass and his discovery of the truth of Jesus and how he, as a murderer was allowed to live and be set free from imprisonment.  My kids enjoyed watching this DVD and both are 5 or younger.  Both of them preferred the story involving the little boy since the character was more relate-able to them.  This was a good movie to help remind kids of the true meaning and purpose of Easter, but they have been more engaged with some other choices on the market.  They particularly liked the movie ""At Jesus' Side"".",1367107200,,838,4.546666666666667
2491718,2,B000E5MI0Q,"I have actually only watched ""The Easter Promise."" A big portion of the story focuses on a fictional story line. I realize that some of this is maybe helpful to make it more relevant to kids, but they did too much with it. Because of this poorly written, extra story line I found myself having to explain to my 3-year-old why one evil looking man was trying to kidnap a young boy. Also, I was disappointed to hear words like ""stupid"" and ""idiot"" in a Christian film.",1364688000,7,466,4.367816091954023

8105896,5,B000E5MI0Q,My Sunday school kids loved it,1492646400,,30,4.166666666666667
8105897,5,B000E5MI0Q,"The Easter Promise is an excellent animated film for the young and old alike. If you want your child to know and love Jesus, this is must have!! The witness is a good film as well, but definitely for 8 - 12 years to learn more about their faith. The Witness I would give a 3.5 - 4 star rating.",1484697600,,293,3.9
8105898,1,B000E5MI0Q,"So frustrating that they would put 'stupid' and 'idiot' pervasively! I'm a children's ministry director and wanted to show this during our Good Friday childcare for 6-11 year olds, but don't want them to go home having picked up words their parents have told them not to use. Huge bummer...",1458691200,,290,4.82

8105904,1,B000E5MI0Q,"I was so disappointed to hear them calling  a dog ""stupid mutt"" and call each other ""idiots"" my 4 yr old considers these ""bad"" words. Why would you use this language in a Christian children's film?? One star for language.",1427500800,2,221,4.525
