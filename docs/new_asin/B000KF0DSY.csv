NOTABLES:

BLONDE ICE is a postwar film noir about a reporter who marries two wealthy men and murders them both.

Ed Wood Jr. shocked the world in 1954 with his crossdressing semi-autobiographical film, ""Glen or Glenda."" Two years later, Wood scripted THE VIOLENT YEARS, a story of crossdressing juvenile delinquent GIRLS. Their odd little gang takes to robbing gas stations, raping young men at gunpoint and other anti-social acts.

The newest title here, THE FIRING LINE, is a cheapo Philippine-made action film about a peroxided lady helicopter pilot engaged in jungle warfare. Laughable production values, bored-looking actors.

SWAMP DIAMONDS is a Roger Corman quickie about a group of hard-edged female prison escapees. They hijack a boat and its wealthy owner and go deep into a swamp in search of a stash of hidden jewels.

ST. CLAIR DVD multi-packs are reasonably priced, and offer fine quality video/audio transfers of unrestored public domain material. Discs are single-side recorded, plastic storage cases fairly sturdy, liner notes appear on box's back cover.
