8262506,4,B0016HGHKI,"This book filled in a lot of details about the early atomic testing in the Pacific - an event which occurred before my birth. It contributed to my understanding of how little scientists and the military really knew about atomic energy at the time, especially its radioactive aftereffects, and explains the terror of a nuclear war the adults in my family felt during the 1950's, when people built fallout shelters and practiced duck-and-cover drills in school. Maps of the test sites, locations of dummy ships within the sites, and photos helped me visualize the atolls. I was amazed that the crews cleaned up afterwards with little awareness of their exposure to radioactivity, while at the same time, I felt compassion for the island inhabitants who longed to return home. After reading ""Operation Crossroads,"" America didn't seem such a monster-nation for dropping atomic bombs on Japan. The goal was to end a war America never wanted and had fought too long. No one realized at the time the Pandora's Box that atomic warfare opened.",1433980800,2,1035,4.988439306358382
