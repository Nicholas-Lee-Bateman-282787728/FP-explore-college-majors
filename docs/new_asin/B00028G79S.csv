8023791,5,B00028G79S,"This live lecture originally aired on PBS is an excellent companion to any one of Marianne's books (some of my favorites being ""Healing the Soul of America"" and ""Everyday Grace"").  What is unique about Ms. Williamson as an author and lecturer is her transparency.  She never ceases to cull from her own foibles and personal experience in order to demonstrate the wisdom of spiritual laws.  Usually a lecturer on the modern spiritual text, ""A Course in Miracles"", Marianne is easily able to move out of a strict Course perspective and apply the wisdom of religious thought into our lives.  Though some Course purists have created a bit of controversy around whether or not she should be using Course philosophy without really delving into it's unique and controversial metaphysics, I have learned much from her insights.  She remains grounded and human all the while touting lofty spiritual ideals.  This DVD is a light in the religious/spiritual/self-help community.",1140307200,20,966,5.160256410256411
8023792,5,B00028G79S,"""Fairytales are actually metaphysical information given to all of us if we actually look at what they say."" - From the DVD

According to author Marianne Williamson, the very thought that miracles CAN happen is an extraordinary empowerment, if we allow it to be. This concept is much like the ""magic wands"" of fairytales like Cinderella whereby mice turn into coachmen, pumpkins into coaches, and rags into ball gowns.

In the DVD Everyday Grace, Williamson gives a 75-minute live lecture explaining why humanity needs to evolve beyond where it is and how miracles can play a vital part in individual and corporate transformation.

The current age reflects a mechanistic, Newtonian worldview where the earth is as a large machine where we have very little power to change objects and events outside ourselves. Echoing modern theories of Quantum Physics, Williamson asserts that when we observe and perceive something differently, the object itself changes. She goes onto to say that our species is no longer well adapted for survival because we fight too much. We must evolve past the place where the only way we fix things is to destroy them-much like the mindset found in modern medicine.

In the Everyday Grace DVD, Williamson goes on to share five ""magic wands"" that can help us tap into a power that is in us, but not of us-that can do what we cannot do for ourselves. They are:

Wand #1 - Consider the possibility a miracle could happen here.

Wand #2 - We are the angels we've been waiting for. Breakthroughs happen in our lives when breakthroughs happen within us.

Wand #3 - Every thought of judgment blocks the Light. If we knew enough about almost anyone we could, on some level, forgive almost anything.

Wand #4 - The end is inherent in the means. If we make ""the goal"" paramount, we will be tempted in various ways to compromise our integrity, exploit relationships, and engage in unethical behavior.

Wand #5 - Sacred silence rights the Universe. Every spiritual and philosophical tradition encourages prayer, the cultivation of stillness, meditation, etc.

Saying that the 21st century belongs to the ""Fairy Godmother"", Williamson describes the symbolism of Cinderella, applying the metaphor to our evolving consciousness. Stressing that our thoughts create reality, she admonishes us that the wars will stop outside only when they stop INSIDE. In fact, ""today's newspaper is just a reflection of yesterday's thoughts"" but we can apply the five ""magic wands"" to create miracles in both the world and ourselves.

This DVD also includes an extensive interview with Marianne Williamson, covering topics such as:

* Her early career

* Her favorite book

* The writing of the book Everyday Grace

* Her greatest achievement

* The greatest challenge in the world

She says that ""you can't touch an audience without the truth of your own journey"" and Williamson has consistently lived out this ideal through her books and lectures. If you'd like a good dose of hope and the means to create a magical, beautiful world, the Everyday Grace DVD shows the way.",1133049600,44,3065,4.966731898238748
