8383369,5,B002WQ1E0U,This film treats the people and the subject with dignity and truth. It does a very good job of presenting different views and where people are coming from. It also shows the gulf between them without resorting to the usual tactics. Very refreshing and disturbing at the same time. I watched it online and then purchased a copy to show some friends and to facilitate discussion. The package is well thought out as well.,1315180800,2,418,4.662162162162162
8383370,5,B002WQ1E0U,Lots of people have an agenda when they talk about HIV. This documentary takes a critical look at the poor thinking behind both sides of the condom/abstinence debate. Very educational and thought provoking!,1276560000,3,206,5.2727272727272725
