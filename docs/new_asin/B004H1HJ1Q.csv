8429237,1,B004H1HJ1Q,"This is the same video as "" Pink: A Life Less Ordinary Unauthorized."" VERY peeved that I ordered both and they are EXACTLY the same video with a different label!

DONT GET ME WRONG I LOVVVVVE P!NK!!! Just the companies who do this to make a buck and screw the customer I HATE!",1380672000,6,276,4.2075471698113205
8429238,1,B004H1HJ1Q,"this is a rip off and more about other singers, the wording on the back says : this film is not  I repeat NOT authorised (their spelling not mine) by Pink her record label or managment, had I known this I would never had spent my money on it.  It's basically a few  unknown people saying what they think of Her career. very disappointing and I wish she knew this rip off was going on.  In fairness, I guess, it does show her singing a little, no complete songs.  I was not happy.  More Linda Perry's opinions than anything.",1374969600,4,523,4.232323232323233
8429239,4,B004H1HJ1Q,"Although this is an unauthorized ""biography"" of her career, it is pretty factual.  It is a rather long video that doesn't even cover her greatest hits though.  It only goes to Funhouse.  I enjoyed watching it solely because I absolutely love Pink.  Other than that, it was decent.",1363132800,3,280,4.770833333333333
