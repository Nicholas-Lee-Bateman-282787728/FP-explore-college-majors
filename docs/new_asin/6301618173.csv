8171262,5,6301618173,"This tape is a version of Callanetics or squeeze style workouts, working both upper and lower body in under 26 minutes. Upper body is based on unweighted pulsing/squeezing moves often seen in Margaret Richard's Body Electric tv shows. The standing legwork is based on the plie and the pelvic tuck seen in Callanetics Countdown, and the floor work is similar to the Callanetics stomach series with stretches from Callanetics for your Back. It is a bit faster than Callanetics but not as challenging because you don''t do as many reps. Overall, though, it is a good introduction to this style and had quite a number of fans when it came out in 1990. Esquire's Super workout and Upper Body workout also include exercises in this genre. If you like Callanetics, as I do, you are always looking to add to your collection, and this fits the bill as a not-too-hard total body Callanetics-style quickie.",1280188800,4,895,4.818181818181818
8171263,1,6301618173,"I bought this tape because I love my other Great Body workouts; the ""Step Aerobics/Low Impact Aerobics"", ""Dynamite Legs"", and ""Upper Body Beautiful"", but I have several other Great Body tapes that are definitely not great, and this one is one of them. Forget it.",1249776000,,262,4.844444444444444
8171264,5,6301618173,"This is a workout that is great for toning and flexibility. They go through a 30 minute ballet style class. It is only 30 minutes but it is good. This tape is very good for beginners who want to strengthen and tone. Who ever wants to improve flexibility,this is a tape for them. I think it is really effective.",1153180800,6,310,4.271186440677966
