8417704,3,B00017USNQ,"This is a really good video as far as the content goes.  However the video quality is very poor.  It looks like they used a VCR/DVD combo unit to record the VCR version onto a DVD.

I think this video could use an update.  That being said, the content was very helpful.",1204416000,,269,4.115384615384615
