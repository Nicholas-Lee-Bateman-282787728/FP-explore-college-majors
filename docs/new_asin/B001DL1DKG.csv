I tried to contact them through email but I never got a reply. This is just disappointing because Kevin talks about how great his rubs are (and they look and sound amazing) but alas, they are no longer for sale. So I would recommend this DVD, but keep in mind that you'll have to use different rubs and possibly use a different method if the rub you're using is high in salt content or it uses different sugars.",1363910400,,561,4.352380952380952
8304481,5,B001DL1DKG,"At 61 years old I realized ""I'm a real fan of back yard grilling/cooking and have been my whole life."" Recently I became interested in smoking meats like ribs and pork shoulder. I was on vacation last year (2010)in Kansas City Missouri and saw a store named ""BBQ Fans"" in North Kansas City. I stopped in and was treated to ""BBQ Heaven"" inside the store. Man this guy had it all. Tools, grills, wood, rubs, sauses, utencils you name it, he had it all in stock. So I dropped some money and while I was checking out, I mentioned to the guy at the counter that I was just getting into smoking meats. He then said, ""If you are wanting to learn how to do it right, this guy's dvd will help you out a bunch! Take it with you."" I've watched it several times and used Kevin's techneques, and man what a great informational product he has here. Last weekend I smoked a pork shoulder so I could make some pulled pork sandwiches and with the help info from this DVD I nailed it the first time. It was a home run in my book and my family and friends were very happy with the meal. Kevin showed me how to do it with this great DVD!!!! Thank you and nice job Kevin!",1305590400,5,1150,4.138392857142857
8304482,5,B001DL1DKG,"A lot of videos about BBQ are about competition and don't give any instructional information. In this video, Kevin and FK go through step by step on how to produce good tender BBQ on a consistant basis. They also use a couple different cookers to show that you don't need a BBQ trailer to smoke meat. The video is to the point and shows how to prepare different cuts of meat from trimming,seasoning and marinating. Great DVD! I hope that Kevin comes out with more BBQ vids as I look to these for instruction and enjoy watching them.
