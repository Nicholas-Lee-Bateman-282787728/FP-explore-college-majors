8630764,5,B00H87BAI4,"I received a review copy and watched it with my dad who is in the late stages of Alzheimer's. I loved the combination of videos, trivia, old shows, newsreels, commercials and more. My dad loved anything with music - especially if it was quick and had a beat. Give him a beat and he's tapping his feet! This is a great idea for people who want something engaging at any stage of dementia but also want to make sure nothing comes on tv that is too loud, violent or confusing - that can open a can of anxiety! Great for individuals, families or even care homes.  Thank you so much for creating this!",1459641600,,596,4.274336283185841

8630766,5,B00H87BAI4,"We watched this video and loved all the clips, music, scenery and animals!  The old news clips were so cool - we remember most of them fondly.  We sent this video to a family member who is caring for our dad.  They mutually enjoy it which is huge since dad is struggling with Alzheimers.  He was singing along with some of the old songs and he loved the old black and white ""TV"".  Nice job.  I would highly recommend this to other family/friends who have a loved one struggling with memory loss.",1390262400,,495,4.326086956521739
