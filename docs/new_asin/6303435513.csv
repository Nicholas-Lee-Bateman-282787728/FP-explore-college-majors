She also gets a kick out of watching them take the bus to ballet and putting their leotards on and hair up. I actually can watch this with her without being bored, LOL. She definantly loves the song at the end and runs around the house singing it to everyone. This tape was a great buy!",1078617600,2,424,4.059523809523809
7847340,5,6303435513,"This video was beautifully done.  The 25 minute video was fascinating to me as an adult and I know children would love it too.  The producers did a very good job of showing the different aspects of practice and preparation ballerinas go through before they perform.  The two professional ballerinas are sisters Rachel and Rebecca Carmazzi.  They are beautiful, graceful, and fun to watch.  Even though most people watching the video wouldn't notice, I have to mention that their technique and skills are brilliant, technically correct and first class.  Children will enjoy seeing them put up their hair and put on their shoes before class.  The parts of the ballet class are also broken down very well.  There are barre exercises, center exercises, jumping and even a demonstration of spotting their head when they practice turns.  There is a segment on dancing with a partner, costume fitting and performing a ballet.  There is also a segment on teaching ballet and it shows small children having fun in a class.  It was interesting and wonderful to see both a boy, and a child in a wheelchair participating in the the activities.  I would recommend this wonderful video to anyone and everyone remotely interested in ballet.  I think children will be fascinated and ask to see it again and again!  Bravo!",1037923200,3,1305,4.899543378995434
7847341,5,6303435513,"My girls are now 5 and 6 years old.  They started watching Ballerina, Ballerina when they were just toddlers.  They loved it then, and love it now.  They have a clearer understanding of what it ""takes"" to be a  Ballerina.  They also recognize the classical music that is heard during  the video when they hear it other places and situations.",954460800,3,341,4.6
7847342,5,6303435513,"""Ballerina, Ballerina!"" is a beautifully made, informative tape for children of all ages.  Our daughter, Natalie (5 1/2), loves this tape and we like that it includes children of different races, genders and  abilities.  In addition, we were pleasantly surprised when we found out  that Natalie's ballet instructor uses this tape to demonstrate ballet moves  to her students.  Great gift for the ""aspiring"" ballerina.  Thumbs up!",947635200,,429,5.409090909090909
7847343,5,6303435513,"We purchased this video for my daughter a few years ago and it is still one of her favorites. She loves to watch how the ballerinas prepare for the ballet, especially when they are fixing their hair. The music in the tape  is so lovely. Her favorite is the Ballerina-You're so Beautiful song.  Children of all ages will love this video.",947548800,,336,4.491803278688525

I find myself softly singing ""Ballarina, Ballarina, your so  beautiful.."" that catchy song during the day.  Sometimes the simple  things in life are enjoyed the most and this one is cetainly enjoyed by our  family.",946512000,,341,4.793103448275862
