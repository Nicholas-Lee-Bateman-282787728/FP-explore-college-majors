Katori Shingo is the weird but observant and smart detective--the outcast with talent who is always annoying his colleagues but getting the crime solved. Yamapi is set to ""keep an eye on him"", and ends up being teased even as he learns a bit on the job, too.

I found this fun, but uneven. Katori's smile is so startlingly odd, and you can figure some of the mysteries out pretty fast. But some were quite good and harder to solve. Hubby and I enjoyed the odd couple teaming, but I wished there was more of the Emi-chan sub-story. Cute odd couple, there, too.

For Yamapi fans, for sure. For Shingo-kun fans, if they can get beyond his quirky character and creepy smile.",1367020800,,795,4.438356164383562
