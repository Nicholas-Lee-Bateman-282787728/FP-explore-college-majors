1198832,5,B00000ADDI,"PATRICK DEMPSEY HAS A NUDE SCENE WITH AND WITHOUT THE GIRL HE JUST MEANT. HE HAS A VERY HOT ALL MALE BODY TO KEEP A WOMAN GLUED TO THE TV. THE LOVE STORY IS TOUGH AT FIRST BECAUSE HE'S ON THE RUN FROM THE LAW. HE WAS CONVICTED WRONGFULLY (BAD LAWYER).SOON THEY BEGIN TO FALL IN LOVE. BRIGITTE BAKO IS A CLASSIC CELLO PLAYER,HER SWEET,FRIENDLY WAY THAWS HIM OUT. THE SEX SCENE THEY HAVE IS HOT,I THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER END! THEY WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.

1198877,2,B00000ADDI,"Patrick Dempsey made a convincing transition from teen star to adult male heartthrob in this film and the chemistry between him and his leading lady is quite nice, but the story is generic, the writing a bit simplistic. There is an erotic scene in the film that definitely has some sizzle to it though.",1423612800,,302,4.611111111111111

1198879,5,B00000ADDI,I would have paid to see this at the theater.  Thumbs up and it was worth the buy.  Also Patrick's feet stink smell just like fought,1397433600,,132,4.038461538461538
1198880,2,B00000ADDI,"I've written to the seller twice with no response because I would have preferred a better copy. During the viewing of 'The Escape', pop-ups appeared throughout the film.  I would have given the film more stars but the pop-ups were very annoying.",1326412800,,245,4.833333333333333
1198881,4,B00000ADDI,"This is not an innocent good guy, played by ""Patrick Dempsey "", wrongly accused by the law. He was a likable but doomed drug abuser who shot and killed some cocaine deakers and was sentenced to 2 life sentences without the possibility of parole. It also had the real good and real bad cop to make Patrick's sins appear somewhat lesser. That being said I wanted to like him, but he killed a guard during a struggle with a shotgun while escaping and I did not like that. Unfortunately I think it was necessary in order for the story to work, and match the tragic ending  shown during the first 2 minutes of the movie) Our ""nice guy"" had to be the likeable bad guy doomed for a sad ending and a failed career as a poet and suffer his unrequited lover of one night Brigitte Bako.  They had a very long ""X"" rated love scene with a couple of nude shots of both Patrick and Brigitte. Netflix again got the rating wrong with its three stars and unlike Amazon they do not show the number of reviewer or their comments. While being a lower budget movie, it had some great outdoor scenes, a unique escaped convict on the run story, and taught us all a moral lesson that users waste their lives and end up in jail or die tragically. This movie is a solid 4 stars so I hope you enjoy it.",1319500800,6,1274,4.217213114754099

This movie had good and bad spots, but I gave it four stars because Patrick Dempsey's fans get to see a lot of him, not just in the buff, but also in that sensitive way he has when he plays the role of a lover.  For my part, it would be great to have the movie on DVD so I can skip right over to him and  Brigitte Bako together. She was great in this movie too. The picture  takes  time to develop a relationship between them. They have a lot of dialogue so that you feel their growing attraction.  I also like the poetry and the nightclub scenes.  I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, but as one reviewer already said, Patrick's  got a great body and is so caring in this movie.  I bought it based on the reviews, and I'm glad that I did.",1229299200,3,884,4.688311688311688

7905782,4,B00000ADDI,"This was a really good movie.  It has just enough suspense to keep the interest up long enough to watch it.  Very good acting all around, as well as great directing.  I'm glad I got to watch this before it leaves Amazon.  I may try to watch it again before then.

This does have some artsy moments, but they are well done and don't last very long.  Rather a somber movie, this can lead to introspection.

I'm only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel that at some points it was a little too predictable.",1471392000,,514,4.183673469387755
