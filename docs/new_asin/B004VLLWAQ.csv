8443503,5,B004VLLWAQ,"This DVD is little more than a handful of horror/fantasy directors introducing trailers to some of their favorite movies and talking about what made them so memorable.  You might think, ""But trailers are only a couple of minutes long ... what can any of these directors say in that space of time?""  A lot, actually.  And they do it entertainingly and enlighteningly (I think that's a word).  Some standouts for me are Joe Dante talking about 'Donovan's Brain', John Landis talking about the British answer to Godzilla, ""Gorgo"" and Guillermo Del Torro, the poet laureate of the horror directors (he really does speak in an effortlessly poetic way) waxing nostalgic over ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (though not the good one).  I actually like all the directors and their movie trailer choices (honorable mention goes to Mick Garris and 'Fire Maidens From Outer Space' ... his take on it is hilarious).  If you don't want to rush out and watch each of these movies after hearing these directors talk about them, you probably aren't a deep movie lover.  What comes through more than anything is the infectious love these guys (and Mary Lambert) have for movies that don't rate very high in cinematic history (except maybe 'Jaws' and 'The Tenant').  And yet they (the films) evoke a lot of love from these people.  This DVD is something of a primer for people just stepping into the pool of fantasy cinema.  And these directors and writers are the go-tos when these same people decide they want to experience the better offerings from that genre. -- But wait, there's more: In addition to the trailers and the directors, this DVD comes with a wonderful, clean print of Roger Corman's cult classic ""Little Shop of Horrors.""  Joe Dante introduces it and offers some nice information (it was filmed in less than 3 whole days).  It's a terrific, surrealist movie, and added to the trailers makes for a great evening's entertainment.",1312156800,6,1925,4.853211009174312
