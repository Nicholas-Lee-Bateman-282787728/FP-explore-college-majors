4461066,5,B004RUEXVQ,"I enjoyed this movie. It challenges you to examine your own faith. Some reviews say that the acting is terrible. I thought the acting was just fine...However, if you're so critical of the acting, then you, sadly, missed the premise of the movie. If you're thinking about purchasing this movie, I would recommend buying it. The value is in the message, not production costs. The best free entertainment is nature that God created. No man can compete with that...not even unholywood",1520294400,,480,4.938271604938271

4461079,5,B004RUEXVQ,"My family loved this movie when I first purchased 3 Christmas's ago. We actually watched The Encounter so much that it was worn out.

4461080,5,B004RUEXVQ,"Probably my all time favorite christian movie!  The plot is simple yet wonderful.  Five strangers meet our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in a hole in the wall dinner.  The message of salvation is clear, he is the way the truth and the life!  Dinner patrons look on their past mistakes, and how the Lord had always been there for them, always watching over them.  Pride and temptations infects some not others.  Don't want to give away too much, but I assure you if you love the Lord you will love this movie!!!",1511395200,,509,4.419354838709677

4461118,5,B004RUEXVQ,"What an unbelievably fantastic film.  The guy who plays the part of Jesus does a sensational job.  So many of these films although they are made with the greatest of intentions come across as very B rated and leave you bored even though you agree with the message.  Not this one though!  I'm a guy and not ashamed to tell you that this one brought tears to my eyes!  I highly recommend this film.

4461137,1,B004RUEXVQ,"I'm a huge God Awful Movies fan, and I like to watch the movies they'll be reviewing before each episode. Most of them are hilariously bad, and I get a good chuckle out of them. The Encounter, though, is different. It's a emotionally manipulative piece of garbage that pries on vulnerability to get them to accept religious dogma. Why any Christian with half a brain would think this is a positive movie is beyond me.

The movie is set in a diner in the middle of nowhere where five people just happen to end up during a bad storm. Turns out the guy running the diner is none other than Jesus himself (albeit looking a lot like Steve Carrell), and he begins to basically tell everyone what's wrong with them, tells them all about their secrets, and basically tries to coax them into believing in him.

Basically an abusive boyfriend.

As someone who was emotionally and spiritually abused by religion (and no, don't tell me my abusers weren't ""real Christians""), this film brought up so many bad memories that I couldn't finish it. Honestly, do you Christians really think this movie is how to show us God's love? By portraying Jesus as a creepy cult leader? Sorry, I'm not buying it!",1483747200,,1184,4.601895734597156

4461140,4,B004RUEXVQ,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It is thought provoking and would make a good subject for a Bible Study.  The acting seemed a little over dramatic at first, but eventually it came together and made for an enjoyable evening.  Movies focused on unexpected encounters with Christ make for good Christian discussion.",1482969600,,310,5.03921568627451

4461145,4,B004RUEXVQ,I found this movie to be thought provoking. Many of the questions asked are ones we either ask ourselves or have been asked by someone interested in knowing more about our faith or maybe someone seeking an opportunity to criticize or challenge it. Either way I'm glad i brought it and i intend to use it a tool to open conversations about who we think God is in the future.,1480982400,,373,4.3428571428571425

4461148,5,B004RUEXVQ,Saw this movie on Pure Flix and had to have it for my collection and to share with family and friends. Awesome movie. Subtle and accurate story line that becomes clearer and clearer as the movie progresses. Captivating with a very clear message only you didn't have to read the Bible or go to church to get the message. Excellent film to get the Message across and lays the ground work for wide open discussion.,1480204800,,411,4.493333333333333

4461153,5,B004RUEXVQ,"Great movie.  It's mainly set in one scene which some people might find boring.  But it's really good, esp for someone going thru a hard time.  I've watched it several times.  It's basically a scenario of Jesus might respond to people today in different situations and how He longs for people to love Him, but doesn't force them to; in the end each individual has to decide if they will follow Jesus and allow him to change/heal/be a part of their lives.",1477267200,,454,4.5

I've lost count of the amount of times I've seen this movie and there's always something new I find that helps to restore my faith during troubled times.  I did myself a favor and purchased the movie that followed this one:  Paradise Lost.  Everyone should do the same.  I feel it's a must see for all:  believers, non-believers and everyone in-between.",1473206400,2,396,4.52112676056338

4461167,5,B004RUEXVQ,"Biased Alert!

Since this film is very much in line with my own beliefs, it automatically gets at least one star for simply existing; for some reason, the industry just does not do this kind of film very well or at all but I will not speculate on reasons.

This is a very low budget film with actors that have been in movies before but never in top draw films, unless as either behind the scenes or as part of the lower cast of characters.

Yes, a couple of the actors need a bit of polish but it was a great script done from a really interesting idea.  The writing is for those of the Christian faith and will not be for everyone.  I am just trying to be honest.  For those of us who rarely get an actual Christian based film, it is one of those sleepers like Sandlot where the story, most of the acting and the meaning simply make it a gem.

I wish the second in the series had stuck to the same script writer and not tried to make it ""exciting"" as it simply does not come close to this truly wonderful movie.",1472601600,,1011,4.075757575757576

4461290,5,B004RUEXVQ,"What could I possibly say about this movie to make it sound interesting. Take away the simple filmography that it incorporates. This movie sends a very clear message of what God thinks of us and how He cares for us. I haven't watched a modern day movie that has been so meaningful to me. And yes, if you watch this movie you will find shades of poor dialogue choices with the people that are around God. However, the man that plays Jesus, his lines are completely on point with scriptural references about the character of Jesus. I also think that Sting (yes the former WCW star) plays one of the best antagonist roles that I have ever seen. The questions that the movies raises are all on point with how people view God and you will definitely get answers to some things that may be relevant in your life. I don't want to spoil any of the plots. The movie is simple but with a core message that makes you think out of the box when it comes to what living a life of faith is. It's not about where or when you go to church. It is about your life that you lead outside of the church and how to reach people overall. I totally would recommend anyone who has doubts about faith or who are not faithful at all to watch this. You just might learn something that you never knew and could save your soul. It certainly did it for me.",1437264000,4,1324,4.216535433070866
4461291,5,B004RUEXVQ,"This movie is incredibly touching, and opened my heart and mind to start watching more christian based films. The message touched me because I saw myself and husband in the couple in the diner. I instantly realized how wrong I was. That night I prayed and vowed to change. My 10 yr old son also loves this movie, which is a awesome because I rather have him see this anytime over anything on TV. I love the guy who plays Jesus! Soft spoken and you just believe him. I love how the actor who portrays Jesus, portrays him also in many other Christian Films such as Revelation Road series. This movie will truly move you to tears just because it touches something in your heart and mind.",1436918400,,684,4.393700787401575

4461304,5,B004RUEXVQ,"This movie literally changed my life. I used to get annoyed with anything that had to do with Jesus (whether it be music or a movie). This movie was on netflix and at the time, I was really into UFOs and documentaries about aliens. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it had to do with aliens. The moment I figured it was about Jesus, I wanted to turn it off but something made me keep it on. I watched it alone and by the end of the movie, I was crying like a baby. At that instance, I gave my life to Jesus and as I said those words to accept him as my Lord and Savior, I SWEAR!!! The sunlight coming through my window got a lot brighter with the warmest feeling I've ever felt. That was about 4 years ago and now I'm a Christian. I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone in need of hope. It's certainly changed my life for the better and now I have something to look forward to and thats to be home with our Father in Heaven.",1432252800,,945,4.005291005291006

4461306,5,B004RUEXVQ,"I came upon this movie by accident, while watching Netflix & I'm so glad I did! I was at a really low point in my life, having found out that my bf, whom I was very much in love with, had been cheating on me the whole time with someone I knew & that she was carrying his child. Talk about a ""God why did you let this happen?!?!"" moment! After watching this movie, I finally felt some peace in my heart. I finally had answers to so many questions & I realized that what we want so badly is not always what we need & that this life & the pain we endure here is temporary but through Jesus & our faith in him, we can live an eternally happy life after this miserable one. By the end of this movie, I found myself on my knees, giving my life to Christ again. Yes, it's possible to do so, then stray so far from Him that you need to do it again. At least I believe so b/c I experienced it. I could identify a little with each character in this movie, but I really identified with Melissa & now I have faith that He has plans for me & he wants better for me than what I had, just like Melissa. I hope Bruce Marchiano & Co. make many more movies like this one. I'm pretty sure I've watched this one at least 10 times in the last month & I go back to it every time I feel I need a reminder of some of the lessons learned in this movie.",1431820800,,1327,3.846715328467153

4461308,5,B004RUEXVQ,"i haven't got it in the mail yet but, i ordered this DVD because i saw it on youtube and i really enjoyed it. i also saw the sequel on youtube but, i liked this movie better because it was more personal and more intimate than the 2nd one. I also really like that this movie really makes a person think about what it would be like to personally meet Jesus the Living Christ in Person whether in a diner or anywhere else. it would be an amazingly incredible experience and i Highly recommend this movie to all who either know Jesus already and are saved or to those who are not saved but, are seeking answers to questions that they feel would help them make the decision to become His son or daughter for Eternity. To all who read this who are unsaved, i tell you the Truth: Jesus Christ Is the Son of the Living God and He loves you SO much that He died on the cross for you, to pay for your sins so that, by believing in Him and accepting His death on the cross as payment for your sins, you can live in the Kingdom of Heaven with Jesus for Eternity. Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No One goes to the Father but By Him. So, please, watch this movie with an open mind and an open heart and really wrestle with the Truth about Jesus.",1430870400,,1250,4.064777327935222
4461309,4,B004RUEXVQ,"I had seen this film on Christian TV and wanted to share if with family.  The characters who encounter Jesus by surprise, have various life circumstances to which Jesus offers his understanding and counsel.  Not all listen nor follow His leadings.  It presents the invitation to trust in God for His plans for each person's life fulfillment and ultimate happiness.  It also explains punishment for not following God's will.  And makes very clear that one must commit his/her life to Jesus to be saved, that He will provide the guidance and graces needed to those who do.  Those who do not risk dying and eternal punishment.

My family liked the characters portrayed and the manner of presenting insights into people's lives.  The actor, Marchiano, playing Jesus was well-received.

I'd recommend this to other families.",1430784000,,819,5.052238805970149

But I was drawn to it because I've seen  Bruce Marchiano in movies before. I really enjoyed and loved this movie. From the plot, to the cast, characters, everything was well done. God knows all of us intimately, from the moment we're born to our very last hour.

What got me was the realistic cynicism from the character Nick and his fate (spoiler). He asked questions and used arguments that many atheists, agnostics and skeptics will ask. There are several people like the character Nick.  God loves them too.

What also caught my eye were the personal stories, problems and the different past of each character. The different lives of people were interesting. God knows everything.

I like how Bruce's portrayal of Jesus in this movie was a balance between showing God's love but also His authority and power over the enemy. You can't have one without the other.",1422144000,,983,4.626436781609195

4461366,3,B004RUEXVQ,"The persona of Jesus portrayed here is warm and wonderful, and some tough issues are dealt with in a straightforward and convincing manner.

However, there are just enough flaws here to keep that fourth star out of reach.

In one scene a man whose wife is seeking divorce asks Jesus to help him, and the Lord replies 'All you have to do is ask'.  The man then whimpers 'Help me, Jesus' like a little child - to me it struck a sour note and was embarrassing.  Although the overall concept is obviously campy and fun  (Jesus's restaurant employee name tag actually says 'Jesus'), having a state trooper named 'Deville' (guess Who) went just a little too far and strayed into the cheesy side.  Some of the cast honestly have a hard time outacting the furniture, and one unintentionally funny moment occurs when a character rises from a table to speak and stands on what is clearly their 'spot' marked on the floor with masking tape.

The one exception to the lackluster ensemble acting comes in the character of a ex-athlete who is building a fast food franchise.  An arrogant, worldly, and independent man, he reminds us of many in our increasingly secular world.  Some of the best dialogue develops as he challenges Jesus on issues that will sound familiar to anyone who has had discussions with an atheist.

My other concern, from a theological point of view, is Jesus being portrayed as exerting quite a bit of direct manipulation in the lives of some of the characters.  This seems to imply that their free will is being revoked.

Overall I enjoyed the movie, but as in all things it is Jesus who carries the main burden and saves the day.",1420416000,,1641,4.620689655172414

Low budget, not low on the message it gives you how important it is to have a relationship with the savior Jesus Christ. Fine acting, especially Bruce Marchiano who plays the role of Jesus so perfectly, you think you're actually seeing the living Jesus right on your TV. I think God gave us this guy to send out the ultimate message, you can be saved if you have Jesus in your hearts. Great for everyone of all ages. God bless everyone. Share this movie to everyone.",1417824000,,547,4.48

4461402,5,B004RUEXVQ,"Even though I am a believer, I am not normally a fan of Christian movies. But this one is both contemporary and cool. It explains God's love and salvation in a way that encourages intelligent discussion, instead of beating you over the head with the ''religiosity hammer''. It is a more like a twilight zone episode than a typical Christian movie, and is VERY scripturally accurate. Well worth buying and sharing with others. And if you liked this type of Christian movie, I would suggest checking out WHAT IF(with Kevin Sorbo, Kristy Swanson, Debby Ryan and John Ratzenberger), and JOSHUA(based on the superb Christian book by Joseph Girzone).",1414195200,,644,4.972222222222222

4461407,5,B004RUEXVQ,"My wife and I loved this movie. The Encounter was about Jesus final appeal to someone who was about to die. The movie was a well-done low budget film. Non-Christians may not appreciate the theme of the movie, but they might like the imaginative presentation.

Most of the movie took place in the Last Chance Diner, a diner supernaturally placed near a road leading north across the desert. The storm-stranded patrons, a young teen, a woman about to marry a lonely man living in Winnemucca NV, a married couple on the verge of divorce (the man a weakly believing Christian and an unbelieving wife who thought she was righteous), and an extremely wealthy ex-pro football player with a greatly successful fast food chain who was full of himself.

The proprietor of the Last Chance Diner was Jesus. He made appeals to each patron based on their individual needs. He did not win over all persons in the diner that stormy night.",1413590400,,922,4.720496894409938

For instance:  look at the clock in the diner each time it's shown.  Look at the sign on the door that says ""Last Chance Diner,"" and then look at it again when the movie is almost over.  Look at the changes made on the counter.  Great story, good acting, good movie.  Great for Bible Study.",1412553600,,427,4.329113924050633

4461419,5,B004RUEXVQ,"I watched this film with an intensity of which, I've never before experienced.  Very soon into the film, I stopped watching as a 'viewer' and started watching as someone who had just stepped into the storyline, as one of the characters. After the movie ended, I felt the deep need for some honest soul searching, into my personal relationship with Jesus.  Every Christian should watch this, and invite friends & family over who are not of the like faith. So they too, can have a life changing moment to reflect upon.

4461421,5,B004RUEXVQ,Great movie...Basically I hope my review doesn't offend anyone. People have different opinions and religious beliefs. The movie came as a total surprise to me;it is about an encounter with the Lord our god and the Devil. The movie was peaceful not scary at all and would be appropriate for older children. It would be a great movie for someone who is trying to decide whether they want to serve the lord.,1412208000,2,404,4.625

At first sight I wasn't going to watch The Encounter but I noticed  unlike a lot of movies on Netflix, this movie had 5 stars. All I can say is, I love this movie and I can see myself watching it over and over again because it was just that good. The plot is very simple, a group of people are forced to take refuge in a small diner that is located in the middle of nowhere on a dark dirt road. They are greeted by a man with a very friendly deposition and that knows everything about each person.

Very good movie!",1410912000,,615,4.074380165289257

It is also a fairly predictable ""feel good"" Christian movie. The good...it is a fairly predictable ""feel good"" Christian movie. Yes, I know I already said that but if you want an escape from the trash on TV and in the theatres, then you can't go wrong with this one. This was a great representation of the gospel message using a unique diner format. Some accepted the message and some did not...but all heard. Given the seriousness of the presentation, I was surprised to find myself enjoying...even laughing...at moments in the movie. ""Jesus"" was quite funny and approachable as he worked behind the counter and prepared the food. This one is worth watching again.",1407888000,3,828,4.756944444444445

4461445,5,B004RUEXVQ,"We had seen this movie some time ago and loved it.  Couldn't find it anywhere (to rent) so we bought it.  This is an excellent movie if you are a ""believer"".  (Or for those who want to get some form of an idea how Jesus really is)  This is very Scriptural (except for the one little part where Jesus shows the nail prints in His wrists, where the Bible is very clear that they are in His hands)  This movie allows you to see Jesus as a real person who loves His creations-us.  The gist is that these different people end up stranded at a diner where Jesus is waiting to serve up the exact meals they like and  His answers and reasons to their problems....and how much He loves us.  Don't want to give away ending but not all believe in Him and listen to what He has to say.  The movie keeps you engrossed because you just have to see if the one couples marriage works out, the teenage girl runaway keeps running, the young woman keeps heading to her boyfriend that is using her and if the guy who loves the world and every thing in it keeps running towards it.  The guy playing Jesus, Bruce Marchiano, is one of the best at doing so.  (He also plays Jesus in Revelation Road)  This is an excellent family movie and we truly enjoyed it.",1406160000,,1235,4.186440677966102

4461465,1,B004RUEXVQ,"...because it's the worst movie I have ever seen. I honestly don't think I have ever witnessed acting so abysmal or a plot line so painfully predictable. It screams Christian Propaganda but may have had the potential to be much more wide-reaching if it had been just a little more subtle. I would find the whole movie more palatable if it turned out that Jesus was actually a sociopath waiting for the most opportune moment to murder everyone in his diner after sufficiently creeping them out. The situation is much more appropriate for a horror film and I keep waiting for the plot twist. I find myself rooting for Nick, the former NFL-player turned non-believer/sinner who challenges all of Jesus' claims just because he's the only one who doesn't fall for the ridiculous story in the first 30 seconds of their ""encounter."" Spoiler alert: the police officer (named DeVille) comes back to the diner to let everyone know that the road is reopened after the storm but his ominous laughter makes it clear that he is totally the devil and is trying to tempt the diners into leaving Jesus. Nick is the only one that goes despite the objections from Jesus and the others and he dies in a horrible car accident because he chose not to believe. Great lesson.

People with different problems/burdens come into the diner, and the counter worker, who is Jesus, talks with each one and lives are changed.  Not many actors; not many costumes and sets; nothing fancy.  None of these were needed.  The point was made:  Jesus is the answer!  I plan to share this movie with several friends.

This is not a big budget film, but it's not bad, either.  Stay with the story, stay with what the actors are saying, stay for the surprise ending.  And stay for Bruce Marchiano's portrayal of Jesus the 'cook'.  After you see this film, look for other Marchiano portrayals of Jesus as well as David A. R. White's performances in FRONT of the camera.

I wasn't sure when I ordered this film, though, whether I would like it.  I've seen movies that advertised appearances by Jesus, which turned out to be more about Hollywood special effects than our relationship with God.  I was very pleased when I watched this film.  Bruce Marchiano is a very amazing actor, and although I hadn't watched any of his other work in the role of Jesus at the time that I bought this movie, I now know that his portrayal is an excellent example of the way that I imagine Jesus to be; loving, caring, and passionate about wanting the very best for His children.  After seeing this film, I bought the sequel movie, Encounter 2: Paradise Lost.  I was even more touched and happy with that one.  I recommend both films for anybody who wants to form a deeper relationship with our Lord and Savior.  Thank you, Bruce Marchiano, and PURE/FLIX, for your incredible films, and I hope that there will be more sequels to this original ""Encounter"" movie!!!",1394582400,,1104,4.591836734693878

4461497,5,B004RUEXVQ,"I had previously seen this movie on Netflix and thought it was so good I knew immediately I had to own it. Bruce Marciano does a great portrayal of Jesus, with words and demeanor fully supported by what we are told of Jesus in Scripture. The supporting characters come from all walks of life and portray a wide variety of people in various stages of their Christian faith (or lack thereof). Even to lifelong Christians, it is easy to have the feeling that God is ""far away"" and Someone about Whom we can only read but not yet really get to know and relate to as ""present,"" and to such persons movies like The Encounter and portrayals like that given by Marciano can help visualize and remember that Jesus is very much present, loving us and interested in the intricate details of our lives. I would strongly recommend this movie for any Christian. It may well also gently convict and encourage repentance and recommitment for those of us (that is, all of us) who have in any way backslidden from our original ""first love"" of Jesus.",1389484800,,1031,4.548387096774194

I buy many Christian movies to watch, and many do not make the cut. However, this one does, and is a movie that you need to watch more than once. I have watched it 3 times, and the 2nd time was better than the first.

The movie takes place mainly in a cafe, when a bunch of people were stuck from a road closure. However, the people were not there by chance, but a divine appointment with Jesus. The different characters reflect different kinds of people. There is little action, but a lot of conversations, and it is precisely these conversations that makes this movie so good, so you do need to pay attention. This movie can serve as a great evangelistic tool. Unfortunately, the sequel to this is a far cry from this one.",1386806400,,885,4.331325301204819

The ""star"" in this film is Bruce Marchino who plays Jesus, and who also played Jesus in the DVD ""Gospel of Matthew"".  His interpretation of Jesus agrees with  ""my"" feeling about the personality of Jesus . . . a very joyful, loving, Son of Man, Son of God.  In this DVD he plays Jesus in the same way.

4461518,1,B004RUEXVQ,"Absolute rubbish. Within the first ten minutes I knew what the whole movie would be like. An absolute schlock-fest. My wife and I were calling each lime before it was said... I'm not even joking. Predictable, dreadfully paced, poorly scripted, and obviously just another vehicle to deliver the gospel message. Christian art needs to understand that art needs to be made for art's sake, not as a method to convey Christian precepts. If you simply make what's in your heart and let your worldview inform your creative attempts, you'll find yourself with a quality argument for the faith without even trying, and therefore be much more effective for the kingdom of God. And yes, I am saying that this movie is not heartfelt; it's an on screen agenda. I hope that Christian movie making really steps it up... It's gotta get better than this!!! By the way, I'm a Christian myself, it just so happens that I hold Christianity to a much higher standard when it comes to the arts.",1384214400,6,972,4.723529411764706

4461526,4,B004RUEXVQ,"I decided to get this movie because it had Jaci Velasquez in it. I have been a fan of her music for many years, and had seen her other movie ""Chasing Papi"". The movie arrived in perfect contition, and told a pretty good story. Most of the actors seemed well-fitted to their characters. One thing that bothered me was that in certain scenes, the conversation was hard to hear or even notice without subtitles. At one point about an hour into the movie, someone talks for about 10 minutes about a few whispers that occured in the first 5 minutes of the movie (unless you actually heard them, you would not have known until then that they were there). I had to go back and add subtitles to find them.  Watching the movie on a different tv fixed that problem however. So that may simply depend on what system or settings this movie is watched on.

I would recommend this movie for anyone who is a fan of Jaci Velasquez or the wrestler ""Sting"", or looking for a non-pushy evangelical movie. Rather than ""telling"", this movie ""shows"" Christian faith and love. If the audio hadn't had the problems, this movie would have gotten a clear 5 stars from me, but since there is not a 4.5 or 4.8 star rating choice, it gets a 4.",1381536000,,1214,4.391111111111111

Each has an encounter with Jesus Christ and how they relate to Him yet the film is not preachy. It impacted me like the movie End of Harvest but they are entirely different.

4461537,5,B004RUEXVQ,"This movie was not at all what I expected. It is about 5 people traveling and getting stuck on a rainy road that has been shut down due to  dangerous conditions. They all go back to a diner that is supposed to be closed according to the evil looking cop, but they saw it was opened. The owner of the dinner is a man named Jesus. As the plot unfolds He convinces them that He is Jesus the son of God (and God Himself) as He knows all about their lives, (shocking them). Each person came from a very different background.  Jesus challenges them to make the necessary changes in their lives so they can follow him, and live Fulfilling their purpose here on earth, and spending eternity in Heaven.  Though he told them life would not be easy He said He will always be there for them.  Jesus answered some of the hard questions we all have in this fallen world. Bruce Marchiano is a very gifted Minister and actor. He played the part of a modern day Jesus incredibly well. This movie was a very family friendly movie, yet it was not boring or slow. I also found this movie to be very balanced and sound in its Biblical teaching, and representation.
I give this 5 stars because I felt its content, acting, and plot was deserving of it. None of the women were dressed cheeply as I have seen in other Christian movies, (usually the pastors wife or girlfriend).
I would recommend this movie to everyone, and anyone, especially those that say they are Christians.
The only thing I would change is I would have Marchiano's hair longer, I like the way he looks with his hair longer.  But that is just my opinion .  He is a wonderful actor either way , and plays Jesus soooo well.",1374364800,,1667,4.344051446945338

4461541,5,B004RUEXVQ,"WOW! i totally loved this movie. Its about a bunch of strangers all meeting in a diner and being served by God. The movie is an eye opener for sure and is a must see for believers and those new the faith or seeking answers alike. The man behind the counters wears a Jesus name tag and calls everyone by name and knows intimate details of their past, present and even future. I thought the acting and dialogue was great - not too over the top or extra dramatic.

In the mix we have a couple where the wife wants to leave her husband, a runaway teen girl, a woman driving 400 miles to meet her boyfriend and potential fianc and a rich restaurant franchise owner played by WCW wrestling champ - Sting!

The state trooper that stops the people midway (saying the road is flooded/damaged) and sends them to the diner - we learn later is Officer De Ville or Devil. The Devil ultimately claims Sting since he chooses to not accept god's love and grace and follows foolishly after the devil to his death.

The important take out is that God is ever watching and is always looking to talk to us through that lil voice in our heart and mind.",1371945600,,1131,4.300469483568075

4461550,5,B004RUEXVQ,This is one of the best movies I've seen that helps explain who God is and why He allows certain things to happen or not happen. This movie was original and modern. The movie has characters with perspectives from every spiritual walk (from believer to non believer and everyone in-between). This is the type of movie where everyone who watches it can relate to someone in the story. This is a must see for every Christian and your non-Christian friends.,1368921600,,453,4.675

4461552,5,B004RUEXVQ,Great movie with a great message. Jesus loves us so much..that is the point of the movie. It's your choice to choose which path. Our family only watches movies we believe would be pleasing to the Lord. We do not watch secular TV. We buy christian based DVD's instead of TV. This movie is on our shelf. A keeper! We recommend!,1368316800,,325,4.344262295081967

After seeing a string of really bad B Christian films, my hopes were not real high for this one. In all fairness, PureFlix has made some really fine pictures, and then...well...some are just poor.  This turned out to be a great surprise for me.  After the first few scenes, I almost didn't stick with it.  Then somehow it captivated me, you got reeled into the characters and fell in love with Jesus.  It turned out to be a great film.  This IS one for the whole family.

Don't let the cheesy exterior scenes distract from the dialogue and occurs in the diner. I heard that Marchiano had memorized the entire script, kind of impressive also learned that the film was shot in a matter of days...not too bad. This film does answer a lot of questions that many people have including why to bad things happen to good people and exactly what we should be putting our faith in. Good film.",1367020800,,555,4.673469387755102

If i realized I was standing before Jesus in the flesh I would be down on my knees crying in worship.  I wouldn't be questioning His motives and works.  I would be in Heaven on earth, moved to speechlessness and grateful beyond speech.  And, someday, soon I pray, I will be able to do just that.  God is SO good!",1364947200,,484,3.9895833333333335

your eyes to watch, I think you will find this movie a helpful tool to communicate the
gospel in a very beautiful way. I have several movies from Pure Flix, including ""Jonny""

4461598,4,B004RUEXVQ,"I loved the encounter on so many levels. How Jesus knew every one of them, their deepest secrets and why they refused him or wouldn't let him in wholeheartedly. What stuck with me the most was the fact that the woman, Helen, with her husband Hank, that she believed or thought she was a ""Christian"" and Jesus told her she was not! Yes, she may have been a Sunday School teacher and walked up to the altar and said a few words, went to church every Sunday, but never truly repented for her sins. Lastly, the ending, what happened to one of the people who didn't want what Jesus was offering.

4461626,5,B004RUEXVQ,"I grew up going to church every Sunday throughout high school, but later, as work and my own worldly pursuits became more important, I put God on a shelf and went my own way.  Thankfully God doesn't give up on us. It is so easy to believe that the concrete world we see before us everyday, is the only realm that exists. The bible says, ""Seek the LORD and his strength; seek his presence continually!""  I have been strengthened by seeking God more fervently over the past year.  I believe Jesus will one day return for his family of believers.  The Encounter is an excellent movie, geared towards teens and above.  It does a wonderful job of making one think about what is at stake, as well as what is promised and bestowed upon us, solely by the Grace and sacrifice of Christ.  I highly recommend it to any Christian who seeks to bolster their belief or anyone who may be searching for proof of God. It's more simple than I ever really knew.  God grants us his blessing of salvation when we simply ask for God's forgiveness of our sins and ask Jesus to come into our heart.  It doesn't have to be any more complicated than that.

4461633,2,B004RUEXVQ,"It's been over a month since I saw this film, and I've debated writing a review because I hate to criticize something so harshly when I know its creators are earnestly seeking to bring truth into a hurting world.

But... This movie is... Just.  So.  Bad.  I mean, it's trying to be serious, and it comes off looking like a sketch for Saturday Night Live.  It's laughably awful.  When the character that's clearly the devil enters the scene -- any scene -- there are lightning bolts and ominous thunder rolls and scary music -- just in case we didn't get from the message (he's trying to make the travelers go the wrong way... Hmmm... Could he be... The DEVIL??).  The acting is abysmal.  The only honest acting was the man who played Hank.  He definitely deserves more roles.  The rest were cringeworthy.

I do think this script could make a good play in churches, and the most amateur actors couldn't do worse.  Seriously.  There are some tough subjects that the script addresses, and that's what I give two stars for.

But the reason I'm writing this in spite of my reluctance to criticize a movie trying to convey such an important message is that there are some wonderful Christian movies out there.  Grace Card is fantastic, and I've really enjoyed all the Kendricks' brothers movies (Fireproof, Flywheel, Courageous, etc.).  In fact, it's because of these great films that I feel like I have to say something.  I believe that we, as believers in Jesus, should hold ourselves to a certain standard.  Yes, there is the issue of ""he who has ears, let him hear,"" but if we want to reach people, then we need to present the message in a way that is not so easy to laugh at -- lest the message get lost.",1348012800,6,1703,4.527868852459016

When they show up the man (Marchiano) working behind the counter claims to be Jesus and sets put to prove it. I have to start by saying that this is not so much a movie as it is a sermon. Jesus goes from person to person telling each one what he did to help them in their hour of need and why they should listen to him. There is one person who refuses to believe and questions Jesus throughout the movie. All that said the movie really just felt like going to church and listening to a priest tell you why you should believe followed by a string of testimonials. If you are into the hard-core Christian movies then this one is for you. I consider myself fairly religious but this was way too preachy for me. Overall, a movie made for those questioning themselves or to be used as a teaching tool. Since this didn't play out like a movie I won't give it a grade though.",1341878400,,1173,4.03862660944206

4461646,4,B004RUEXVQ,"I really enjoyed the film.  very thought provoking, and i do feel God spoke to me through the film.  it definitely made me think.

my only criticism of the film, and the reason i gave it 4, instead of 5 stars, is i think it will rub some people the wrong way.  some will just hear 'YOU MUST REPENT' and will automatically be turned off by the film.  IMO, this kind of tactic doesnt work in sermons (its why i have a hard time attending church), it doesnt work outside a mainstream rock concert, at universities, at gaming conventions like blizzcon, etc.  all it does is turn people away from God.

we are not perfect.  just because we accept Christ into our hearts does NOT automatically mean we are going to stop sinning.  God knows this.  its the reason Christ died on the cross.  He died for our sins.

In my opinion, what Christ wants from us, is to 1, accept Him into our hearts, 2 hear His call when He beckons, and 3, be honest with ourselves.  understand that nobody is perfect, accept people of ALL walks of life for who and what they are, and realize that we are going to make mistakes.

again though, there are some great messages in the film, and i do recommend it.  however, because of what i said above, id have a hard time wanting to show this to an atheist/agnostic.",1338508800,2,1282,4.305439330543933
4461656,5,B004RUEXVQ,"We watched this movie last night knowing almost nothing about what we were going to see. The movie is touching and powerful as it portrays Jesus in a contemporary setting making appeals to a variety of people who are all drawn together in a small roadside diner by an approaching storm. The people's individual lives and personal problems tracked many typical situations today and demonstrated the traditional objections to faith in Jesus one hears.

What is of particular interest is the timing of this movie when one considers what is happening in the Middle East; visions of Jesus are causing a large number of skeptics and unbelievers to receive Jesus as their Savior for the first time. The power of the Gospel of Christ is reaching those who could not be reached any other way through visions of Jesus appearing to them in various ways. The large number of people to whom this is happening is causing a great disturbance among leaders of more traditional Eastern religions as one would expect; it is being seen as a tragedy by those leaders.

The character of Jesus is tenderly played by Bruce Marchiano who deals with the typical objections one hears about accepting the gift of salvation. In the story there is a rich ex football player who owns a string of restaurants and taunts and ridicules Jesus; I was reminded of Luke 12:20, ""But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?'"" There is also a young abused teenager from a dysfunctional home effectively played by Madison Gibney; a couple whose marriage is in jeopardy played by Jamie Nieto and Danah Davis and a young Christian woman on her way to marry the wrong man played by Jaci Valesquez.

The movie has a feeling of urgent uncertainty about it which is actually true of life; none of us knows how much time we have left or what the future may hold for us. It is a great comfort for the believer to know that the one who loved us and gave himself for us knows all of that perfectly.

This movie will appeal to all ages and should even hold the attention of the fairly young. Its message follows the teachings of Scripture closely; I recommend it highly.",1338422400,2,2214,4.597468354430379

4461658,5,B004RUEXVQ,"Once you get past the initial judgement that this is a low-budget film, you will quickly recognize that this is a well written script and turns out to be well-made/decent christian movie.  A movie for teens or older, this movie is about 5 people that have to double back to a diner to wait for a flooded out road to come clear and driveable once again.  They all meet Jesus at the ""Last Chance Diner"" and have one final opportunity to accept Him as their savior.  His Grace costs them nothing they just have to repent and accept Him.  The story moves smoothly and captivates as Jesus pleads His case and tells them that He knows everthing about them.  I don't want to give any spoilers but the character portraying Jesus does a brilliant and convincing job at deflecting some of the modern arguements and problems of society as well as pleading His case before the rest of His five stranded guests.  He does not force them in their choice of whether to be saved or not.  I think that anyone younger than a teenager would be bored watching this movie (it is not veggie tales).  This is a movie a family can watch together without fear of foul language.  It is also a wonderful movie for christians to watch in a gathering or bible study.

Thought provoking to say the least, I would recommend everyone watch this movie. The characters and acting catch you up, spin you around and leave you not wanting to leave that diner. The quality of the productions is first rate! This is not a B movie!! Entertaining, realistic and to the point, this movie pulls no punches, and does not water down the Gospel. If you've ever wanted to know just what all this Jesus stuff is about, or even if you already know, check this out, you will not be disappointed. If for nothing else than to be reminded how the love of God is worked out in our lives, through everything, painful or not, this has been a great reminder of His purpose for us, His great love.

God bless! and Enjoy!!

He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.

Romans 1:16
I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes

The following information is an other good way to present the gospel,  because it brings the knowledge of sin, through God's law.  God's law shows us our desperate need for salvation and forgiveness from the Saviour

Please read the following questions carefully, be honest and listen to your conscience. Would you consider yourself to be a good person? The Bible declares, most men will proclaim their own goodness. Let's see if you qualify as being a good person. Have you ever told a lie? Have you ever stolen anything, irrespective of its value? Have you ever used God's name to curse?  Jesus said, I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart?

Have you ever looked at someone with lust? The Bible says that if someone hates another person they are a murderer (I John 3:15). Have you ever hated anyone? If you have answered, Yes, to the previous questions, then you have admitted that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, an adulterer and a murderer and we've only looked at 4 of the 10 Commandments. If God were to judge you by this standard would you be innocent or guilty?  You know you are guilty and deserving of an eternity in Hell.

Jesus Christ came to earth and died a criminal's death not because He had broken the Law, but because we had. God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. What should you do?  Repent, turn from your sins & put your complete faith in Jesus Christ as your Savoir and Lord.  You may die today, in your sin. Is there any reason why you would not accept God's gift?

I really enjoyed this movie it really makes you think about what would God say to you if you and a few other people were alone in a diner one stormy night, what would he say to you? This movie is also about God's love and how he forgives us if we forgive and believe in Him.  God who was played by Bruce Marchiano, showed one person in this film that he was not going to try to force His will on one of the characters if they did not want to believe in Him. This film is a great witnessing tool and I never get tired of seeing this movie. It is a very moving film with a message about forgiveness and love as well, as God is forgiveness, love, and His son is my Lord and Saviour.",1328832000,2,928,3.989247311827957

The actors poured themselves into their roles and ministered to the audience.  I was so proud of Steve Borden.  Myself and many others, I'm sure, had prayed for his salvation along with many other wrestlers back before they came to the Lord.  Now to see him walking out his faith in this arena over floods my heart with joy.  Jacqui Velasquez was brilliant!!!  What can be said of Mr. Bruce Marciano for his excellent performance except, ""Bravo""?  The married couple, the teenage girl and officer in the film played their roles out to the 'T'.  What talent!

4461683,1,B004RUEXVQ,"Your first encounter with Jesus in this movie was that he doesn't want subtitling to work for the elderly hard of hearing and the hearing impaired. Guess they have to go to the other final stop. Your second encounter with the movie was that Jesus didn't want any fast forwarding so that the viewer would not miss a scripted profundity. The third encounter was the frozen tiresome smile of a salesmen selling a product to a clueless mark. Or as the misappropriated aphorism has so poignantly stated, ""There's a sucker born every minute."" Reminds me of what conservatives of whatever faith would profess or would if they had the power, ""If you can't change 'em, or shoot 'em then send them to the worst place imaginable."" Those savage Native Americans (what's left of them, that is) are one barely surviving example amongst many.

As far as the other elements to the movie the acting was appropriately robotic. The directing and cinematography was camera on a tripod adequate and the diner church setting was '50s garish appropriate.

I wonder what the historically great religious minds would think of our contemporary fast food; instant media; a few chants and a donation path to salvation. And, strangely requiring environmentally destructive large houses of homage and equally large bank accounts to sustain the faith. That famous goat herder (or sheep herder depending on whether he's leading or pushing) suggested to me an alternative, more spiritual, flick ""Le Quattro Volte"" for it's insightfulness.",1323129600,2,1505,5.064516129032258

4461691,1,B004RUEXVQ,"You often hear about movies being either character driven or plot driven. Here we have a movie that is neither. I would call ""The Encounter"" ""message driven"", becuase both characters and plot are entirely secondary to, and exist only to support, the movie's message, which could be summarized as ""Jesus offers salvation for free if you'll just accept it, and if you don't, you'll spend eternity in Hell after you die."" and ""Jesus loves you and wants what's best for you"". The plot device involved in getting this message across is that a number of people get caught in a storm and have to seek shelter in a roadside diner, run by a man namned Jesus, and he's not just any Jesus, but THE Jesus. Our travellers are an assorted group of clichd christians, non-christians, poor and rich, from very different walks of life, and they react very differently to Jesus's claims and offers of salvation. What we get is a long discussion, taking place almost entirely in the diner, about some of the usual basic questions in Christian theology (i.e. ""Why do bad things happen?"", ""Where were you (Jesus) when I suffered during my childhood"", etc., much in the same way as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perfect-Stranger/dp/B000EHPXP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perfect Stranger</a>.

Except for this long discussion there's minimal plot going on, making the whole movie feel more like a 90 minute sermon than an actual movie. If you like that sort of thing and are a Christian and want to give your faith a boost, you'll probably enjoy ""The Encounter"", judging from the many 5 star reviews. If you don't fall into that catergory you're likely to be very bored by the movie and find it very tiresome, as I did. Some Christians may think this would be a good witnessing tool for trying to convert people to Christianity but I seriously doubt it. Your intended convertee will more likely fall asleep than be convinced of anything while watching the movie, so the movie is strictly preaching to the choir.

Not recommended to anyone but those mentioned above (Christians who enjoy long sermons and want their faith strengthened).",1320364800,15,2165,5.095774647887324

This movie confronted many arguments that the typical unbeliever has against Christianity and answered them pretty well.  There were many moving scenes and I must applaud the people associated with this great film.

Bruce Marciano's portrayal of ""Jesus"" does a fine job of answering the challenges that are raised to him one by one. The script doesn't shy away from some of the tough issues that people often give as their reason for being unable, or unwilling, to believe in God. In particular, it addresses how a loving God could allow such horrible things to happen in the lives of His people.

It amazes me how many people have come on here and seriously reviewed this film for the acting or filmmaking. Honestly. Do you think people watch a film like this to be dazzled by Hollywood stars or impressive cinematography?

This is a good movie for those who are already Christians, just for the inspiration that this film provides. It's even better for those who are on the outside looking in, but curious. It may answer the very questions that have been keeping someone on the fence.",1317772800,,1026,4.570652173913044

It's positive message is uplifting, even for non-Christians, though most will find the message delivered in a heavy handed way.

Each character is in a different place spiritually.  The unsaved, hurting, abused teen searching for a better place. The bored, confused wife who thinks she's a Christian, looking for something more in life. The Christian husband desperately searching to somehow save his marriage. The saved, single woman looking to be loved in the wrong way. The unsaved, self made man who doesn't need anyone.  Each come face to face with Eternity in the person of Jesus Christ.

Bruce Marchiano does an outstanding job as Christ, gently, lovingly speaking to each need.  What a fine actor and Christian.

Steve Borden is incredible, leading the viewer on the roller coaster hope and crushing reality of his final decision.

Jaci Velasquez touches the soul with genuine heartfelt emotions.

You hurt with Jamie Nieto and are overjoyed with renewed hope.

You travail with Danah Davis in resentment, anger and finally repentance.

You want to scoop up Madison Gibney and hug her tightly (as Christ does spiritually).

You are transfixed in horror as Kass Connors leads a soul to hell with such realism.

It also does not give the `everything gets easy and goes your way` after salvation that some Christian films do.  It shows that we will continue to struggle in this broken world but that we have the comfort of a heavenly father who loves us and is there to help.

4461712,1,B004RUEXVQ,"The basic premise of this movie had potential - strangers stumble upon a isolated diner and meet the owner - a rather strange character who seems to know more about themselves than they do. Sounds intriguing doesn't it?

Unfortunately, this movie turns into little more than a Christian propaganda movie. Old cliches, stereotypes, cheesiness, bad acting, poor direction, and mediocre production quality. The 'reveal' that this diner owner is supposedly Jesus - for real - is made just 10min into the film and the rest is a back and forth discussion about rather simplistic moral questions. But, I know - there are some who say it deserves 5 stars if you just open your ears to hear to the message. If this movie's goal was to speak to the choir, I think it probably succeeds, which accounts for all the glowing positive reviews by Christians. However, as a former Christian, I find the delivery and substance of the message to be patronizingly ineffective.  The sledgehammer approach getting the message across will easily work on those looking for simple answers without nuance, without depth of thought, and just wanting to feel happy and clappy. No spiritual depth at all, just the old blah blah ""believe or you go to hell'. Yea, very uplifting. Very superficial. Very superstitious. Very contrived.

Look, if you are into Happy Clappy Feel Good religion, watch it and enjoy. If you're looking for something that is thought provoking and perhaps entertaining, you're not likely to find it here unless you are interesting in how Happy Clappy religion is viewed by those who love it so.

How I would have done it differently:
Build up the mystery - give subtle hints that this guy is perhaps either a nut, a zealot, or something more...
Keep people guessing - have frequent twists.
Make the guy Mexican named Jesus, not some blue eyed white guy named Jesus. or better still - how about make HER a Latina named Jesua.
Show that Jesua is really just an ordinary human who just happens to be a good listener and can help people see thru their own problems. Perhaps she is psychic - or perhaps, just perhaps, she is in fact something more and leave the audience guessing even when the movie ends.",1316649600,8,2193,4.7631578947368425
4461713,1,B004RUEXVQ,"Was conveniently suggested this in my Netflix account. Took a shot to see if it was worth the 4 out of 5 stars Netflix said it was. It isn't.

I watch a lot of movies, and that includes many movies having to do with or are structured around a spiritual theme. I appreciate any documentary on cultures and religions other than my own. I very much enjoy learning how someone else sees the world. It is fair to say I am open to experience. This movie does not warrant any attention from anyone looking for a quality film about something spiritual (in it's vagueness) or Christian (in it's obvious). Acting is ""wooden"" as a fellow reviewer wrote. That very much describes it, the scenes and actors themselves are very amateur-ish. While they all may be nice people, it all leaves me feeling gipped out of a good time. Religious themes does not have to equal cheesy.

This movie very likely is for those who are ""sold"" on all 'things' Christian. Now don't be offended, you know who you are, you have the tshirt, the hat, and the coffee mug. Nothing wrong with that but just as there are those who follow 'reality' television's advice for what shoes/purse/hairstyle/car/celebrity to sing at your kids 16th birthday party, there are others who have their own crutch, everything religious. If that is you, you will probably enjoy this film. It's acceptable for children of all ages, just as a good religious film should be (no sarcasm, seriously).

I just don't recommend it for actual entertainment.",1316563200,14,1492,4.708812260536399

4461715,5,B004RUEXVQ,I watched this movie on Netflix. When I read the description I thought that it was going to be like all the other Christian movies but this one was different it was for me. This movie used everyday people in different situations to show that God was there all along. If you have ever questioned God and his plan for your life this is the movie to see. It focused on the WORD but in ways that even children could understand that God sees and knows all. He would never leave you or forsake you. It reconfirmed why it is that I serve such a true and loving God. For anyone that is questioning their faith and whether or not God knows what your going through I would advise you to watch this movie. It is a true testament of how HE works.,1316304000,12,734,4.13986013986014
4461716,5,B004RUEXVQ,I seen this movie on netflix twice and that was enough for me to know that I must own it. It was a very eye openning emotional film that I have to share with other. I hope they make a sequal concludding the end with David White the producer and my favorite actor.

4461718,5,B004RUEXVQ,"I have to admit, I found myself snickering at a few of the scenes early on in the film...but then, even though a lot of the acting WAS bad, I realized that this film was speaking to many of the issues that I have dealt with in my own journey of faith. There were times when the characters said something that was almost verbatim how I've expressed a particular sentiment or belief previously. I almost got the sense that God was confirming with me that the way I believed in certain areas was accurate, which really caused me to reflect on the issues being discussed and Jesus' responses to the diner guests comments. By the end of the film I was really won over by it, and the tacky acting just didn't even matter. I just hope one day I get the opportunity to have Jesus as my waiter!",1315440000,2,785,4.275167785234899

I own about 1000 movies and I plan to watch this one over and over again. My husband and I thought it was so great that we took it to our Pastor to see if he would use this movie for family movie night at church, can't wait for that! My husband and I both cried and praised Jesus throughout the movie. It is so scriptural. It makes you have a greater understanding of how and why The Lord may do things in your life and opens yours eyes to appreciate Him more and even the bad things that happen in our life could be The Lord doing it for the good. I believe God gave this movie idea to David A.R. White for everyone. This movie touches on everything and will have you thinking about how great Jesus is for days after watching it!!!

4461723,4,B004RUEXVQ,"Review written by 14 year old girl:
I recently watched the movie ""The Encounter"" with my family. It was very interesting and I enjoyed watching it. It had a great Christian message and it made me think about my walk with Christ.

This great movie was about five people who are all driving on the same small road during a storm only to be turned away by Officer Deville because the road was flooded. They retreat a few miles to the ""Last Chance Diner"" to wait out the storm and find that the store is owned by a man named Jesus. Jesus tells each of them the story of their lives and asks them to come to him and be saved. There is an unhappy couple, a sexually abused teenager, a soft-hearted woman intent on marrying her unchristian boyfriend and a bitter rich business man who have one ""last chance"" to ""see"" or ""know"" him.

This was an amazing movie and I really liked learning from it. It was very enjoyable and at first I wasn't very impressed but as the movie progressed it became more understandable. I would rate this at four because of a great message but it didn't have very believable acting.

Would I/Did I buy it? Yes
Would I watch it again? Yes
Would I recommend it to friends? Yes",1312416000,26,1194,4.321428571428571
4461724,2,B004RUEXVQ,Message good but camera work is horrible.  Tend to get sea sick with all of the jerky camera work.,1312156800,2,98,4.157894736842105
4461725,5,B004RUEXVQ,I viewed the movie on our Christian TV station and the movie stired my thoughts so much that I purchased the DVD.  It is excellent and has some mystery in it with a surprise ending.,1312070400,,181,4.171428571428572
4461726,5,B004RUEXVQ,"I originally bought this movie because I have been a fan of Steve ""Sting"" Borden for a long time.  I found it just browsing.  Since I myself am a Christian, I thought it sounded very interesting.  My son was recently baptized into our church, as well so  I thought this would be a good film for us to watch together (along with his friend) to escape the heat of the afternoon and then have a family discussion about it.

It is spot on...and is an interesting take on how come God sometimes does what He does.  The film delves into why sometimes God allows negative things to happen to good people.  It's very thought provoking.  It was interesting how Sting's character ALMOST cracked...but I believe this is a very accurate depiction of how it would happen too.  It's also a great illustration of how Christ still loves the sinner but hates the sin and gets people back on the right track, if they have faith and just listen.

This is one movie we will more than likely be watching over and over again.  It is one I will also be recommending to all my friends at church and elsewhere.  I think it's a message that people really need, in a time and world where things just aren't all that good anymore.",1311811200,41,1202,4.389140271493213
4461727,5,B004RUEXVQ,"My two teenage sons and I greatly enjoyed this movie.  The message and the symbolism in the movie are excellent and easy to understand.  Marchiano does another super job playing Jesus (be sure to watch the ""Matthew"" video with him, also), and the other actors/actresses carry their characters well throughout the movie.  Great script!",1311033600,9,334,5.148148148148148
4461728,5,B004RUEXVQ,"The Encounter is a high quality excellent ministry tool. Great acting, good camera work and a very creative story line,  all come together to form a ""Twilight Zoneish"", ""X-Fileish""  type film with great meaning. It gives wonderful food for thought and the Soul. We saw it on TV and bought our  own copy on Amazon.

4461729,5,B004RUEXVQ,"Admittedly, I give five stars to almost a third of the movies I review.  Part of the reason is that I seldom review a movie (or book) that I don't see as stellar.  But this movie--seen for the first time at about Midnight on Trinity Broadcasting--answered questions that even I (as a believer) harbored deep in my conscious and subconscious thoughts about Christianity.  It seem to know exactly what question was still left unanswered at the point that the particular question was raised by one or another of the ""doubting Thomases"" temporarily taking refuge in a roadside diner whose manager/cook/waiter/whatever was Jesus Christ.

It left no doubt about the identity of the Diner's waiter.  The Jesus-character pulled no punches from the moment He greeted the stranded customers in from out of a serious storm.  Without pretending to be anything but a fictional story of Jesus' encounter with six persons, each needing His guidance and support, the story unfolded into an excellent and compelling interraction between the customers and their Maker.

It was (as best I could tell) Scripturally accurate and even allowed for the fact that Jesus idn't/doesn't force anyone to accept Him ... even if they believed every word He uttered.

It made me think--deeper than I had thought about some of my own questions ... ever!

I will give this to a couple of my relatives",1310342400,154,1366,4.956140350877193

I did not see any theological flaws in the movie and I thought it was original, modern and a well thought out set of arguments for choosing Christ. It systematically deals with all the major objections as to why people do not believe in Christ.  A truly personal and life changing movie and one to watch when life gets you down.  I also like how they showed the one man who refused to come to Christ no matter how much Jesus tried to convince him it was in his best interest. That clearly showed both sides of the story in great detail and brought clarity to the entire movie.  Introducing this also dispelled the gnostic theory that eventually all people are saved which is not theologically correct.  Hec, most people get 80 plus years to make their decision, I think that's enough time.",1307404800,205,837,4.444444444444445

His unwavering belief and discipleship shine through in this most recent vehicle.  This is a movie for everyone, including children.
