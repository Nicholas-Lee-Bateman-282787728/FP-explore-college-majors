7880982,4,6305004064,A blast to the past.  I was in first grade when I first saw this movie on TV.  I had to see it again so I bought the DVD.  Obviously not as great as I remembered as a 6 or 7 year old but glad I bought it anyway.  Was fun to watch with my son.,1393200000,,242,3.267857142857143

7880984,5,6305004064,I actually lived this movie.  I attended Grambling State University with this football player.  I knew him and his roommate.  It was a fantastic movie although some of the things that happened in the movie was extreme.  I am happy to have my own copy of this movie,1280448000,2,264,4.4375
7880985,4,6305004064,"As far as I know, this film and the volatile 1970 pic ""Halls of Anger"" are the only films I know of that deal with the pressures of White students who integrate all-Black schools. This is an account of Jim Gregory's integration of Grambling College's football team in 1968 and the predictable problems he faced. However, the aspect of the racial problems he faces dissapear midway into the film and it becomes a typical go-team football flick. It's valuable as being a rare and fairly accurate look into life at a Black College (several years before ""School Daze"" and 'A Different World""). However, Bruce Jenner looked WAY too old to be beleivable as an 18-year old college freshman and hamminess abounds, particulrly Geroge Stanford Brown as the Black militant student who makes life rough for Gregory. Show this to a social studies class and see what they think.",1002240000,6,864,4.844594594594595
