8741995,5,B018D6M4GK,"One of the few serious attempts to depict a future with catastrophic climate change, this is well-researched and only pulls a few punches.  In 2009, when this was released, the scenarios depicted were considered ""worst case scenarios.""  Since that time, these scenarios have become increasingly likely.  Anyone who wants to prepare their children for what is coming should see this documentary.",1488067200,3,394,5.426229508196721
8741996,5,B018D6M4GK,"I showed this to my anthropology classes several years ago.  It's a haunting portrayal of where we are headed mostly due to climate change.  That a broadcast network produced it (ABC) is itself remarkable.  Now, in 2016 it seems even more relevant.  One can check off the events that have already happened.",1476057600,2,306,4.826923076923077
8741997,1,B018D6M4GK,"It's an environmental activist type of show, fairly well done but not the high quality nature show like bbc's blue planet. Also, it was made before the Saudi's flooded the market with their oil so some of the assumptions and assertions in the show are outdated.",1471737600,,261,4.695652173913044

8742000,5,B018D6M4GK,"Made in 2008, interesting how much is ocurring even now with the threat of globel warning. Something to think about in our world of excess and waste",1360195200,,148,4.518518518518518

This DVD is transparent in that it claims to represent a potential future of worst case scenarios coming true.  The film explains how climate change can severely impact agriculture, immigration, and coastal cities, and explores the potential that efforts to engineer solutions to climate change could fail with catastrophic consequences (think Katrina write large).  The film also attempts to realistically demonstrate how geopolitics can stand in the way of global negotiations on climate change mitigation, showing that distrust and national interest are barriers to solving climate change.  However, the tone of film is a real downer, too much so for my taste.

What the film does:
The film tells the life story of someone living through 100 years of climate change and focuses on climate change-related social and environmental distress. The film is narrated in autobiographical style, has a documentary-like feeling, and the narration has a discerning, melancholy tone. There isn't much good news. The film first offers an illustration of how international negotiation on climate change may fail and then begins describing several ways that climate change can contribute to social disruption.  For instance, climate change is hypothesized to lead to a large-scale migration of the poor away from increasingly hotter equatorial regions, causing calamity near the US-Mexico border and leading to widespread lawlessness in many US border states. Desert regions of the US struggle with inadequate water supplies and Las Vegas effectively ceases to exist as a major city. A declining standard of living caused by high prices for food, water and energy, is accompanied by major social disruption in a way left my girlfriend and I feeling like its only a matter of time before the worst outcomes of climate change come true and inevitably wreak havoc on our lives.  Of course, in life, there is no guarantee of good news. If we often choose uplifting messages because of their positive impact on the human spirit, this film poses the risk of being too discouraging even if it is realistic.  For instance, green planning and technology gets a passing mention in a sea of depressing news. On the other hand, I have to admit the film's assessment seems like an accurate reflection of our current choice to largely ignore this tremendous problem.

I've always believed that climate change has been a manageable problem that we've mostly chosen not to address.  I'm afraid this film, by compressing nearly 100 years of worst case scenarios into a single experience, left my girlfriend and I with a heavy feeling of inevitably and decline that may be more likely to scare people into denial than motivate them to take meaningful actions. To their credit, I think the film makers recognized people might need to be scared stiff before they will voluntarily make sacrifices in order to deal with climate change. For that, I recommend the film.  It's a sad truth that efforts to prevent climate change are, so far, more a matter of voluntary choice - even a luxury - rather than a requirement we carefully and thoughtfully imposed on ourselves. Overall, don't let this film leave you feeling helpless and discouraged. Watch it and take it as an opportunity to think long and hard about a problem that too many of us have put off dealing with for far too long.",1348876800,8,3459,5.084656084656085
8742002,2,B018D6M4GK,"The earth movie 2100 script has some problems, which leaves a bit monotonous and confusing. The documentary should be more objective, clear and straight to the story was more interesting. Also missing subtitles in Spanish (the second most spoken language after English in the world) and I felt the lack of subtitles in Portuguese. Brazil today is a major consumer of the world. Only in 2011 were more than 7 billion U.S. dollars that Brazilian products consumed in the United States.
Amazon also should create a sales channel for Brazilians.",1336348800,2,541,5.022222222222222
8742003,1,B018D6M4GK,"No reason to buy this in Blu-ray. Picture quality is the worst of anything I have ever seen on Blu-ray. Not even up to standard DVD. Didn't get to see the whole thing on ABC. Story is interesting, but transfer is garbage.",1258156800,17,221,4.285714285714286
