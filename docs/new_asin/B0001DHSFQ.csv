1991682,5,B0001DHSFQ,"I've been doing Yoga daily for 9 years and have added Pilates into my daily practice for the last few months. I was already doing a lot of core type work with programs like Baron Baptiste's ""Core Power"" and others, but Pilates has added another dimension to my daily practice that has been profound! I'm seeing muscles in my torso that were never as pronounced before and theres no doubt that Pilates has been the key!

 I found this program to be very gentle and could be used by someone brand new to Pilates as well as someone already familiar with the system. It can also be used as a gentle and relatively short routine to use on days when someone wants to do some Pilates but doesn't want to push too hard.

  This program begins with Ana Caban explaining the basic principles of Pilates before leading you through a gentle series of exercises. All are shown with modifications so they should be doable by anyone in reasonably good health. Even though these are simple exercises you can really get in touch with your core.

  Ana Caban is a really pleasent and inspiring teacher to practice with and I look forward to working with this some more. I can see that I may add this to the collection for days when I want to go easy but get some Pilates in (I do already have her beginning and intermediate matwork programs.)

 I would also recommend reading Alycea Ungaro's ""Pilates, Body In Motion"" if you'd like to get even more detailed, pose by pose instruction on this wonderful system of self care. Brooke Siler's ""The Pilates Body"" is also excellent.",1138147200,16,1557,4.548387096774194
1991683,2,B0001DHSFQ,"It's beginner II. True I didn't see the ""II"" until it came. However, I've done Yoga and in my opinion it's not beginner.

If you are male, this one is not apppropriate.

There are no physical examples of modified poses.  If you are fairly flexible already, for example if it's not strain at all to sit straigth up--all the way on sit bones, with legs straight out (and do some stretching from there) then this is ok for you. If not, get something else. I couldn't find anything however.",1126656000,7,486,4.438202247191011
1991684,3,B0001DHSFQ,"Ana Caban thoroughly explains the correct posture, breathing techniques, form and mental approach to Pilates. She then goes through a short beginning Pilates workout, offering modifications for those beginners who are not yet ready for the full exercise.

This is not a video you would want to use over and over again. I'm glad I rented it (from Netflix). I used it three times and returned it and will move on to other Pilates workouts. This video did provide a good foundation for me before moving on to others.",1125792000,15,513,4.764044943820225
1991685,5,B0001DHSFQ,"I don't know of a better DVD to start your Pilates journey.  I had 15 years of yoga experience and 10 of dance and I went out and got an intermediate DVD thinking I was ready for anything. Wrong. I found myself confused about what to do with my feet, and what's this leg squeezing talk all about? What the heck is the ""powerhouse"" exactly? Years of ballet had taught me to ""turn out"", but was that the same as a Pilates turn out?

  I decided to go back to square one and really learn Pilates. I have no regrets. Now I have beginner DVDs to loan friends!

This DVD clearly lays out the principles and gets you going.  If you are out of shape, you will feel this. If you have poor posture, you will notice that your alignment is getting better. I am now doing advanced Pilates, but there are some things on this DVD that I still go back to.  If you are serious about really learning Pilates and can't get to a class, this is a great place to start.",1117152000,32,947,4.114130434782608
1991686,5,B0001DHSFQ,"For those who are new to exercise in general and want to try Pilates out, this DVD can't be beat.  Ana discusses the Pilates method and gives an overview of basic exercises that show up often in Pilates workouts (the hundred, roll-ups, single leg circles, rolling like a ball, single leg stretch, double leg stretch, spine stretch, and the saw).  She does each movement slowly to emphasize the importance of proper form.  Furthermore, she does half the reps in an easier, modified way, then half in the traditional way, although she says you can continue to do the modifications if that's what you feel comfortable with.

This is mainly an instructional video.  It is 30 minutes, but Ana is talking much of that time.  It is not much of a workout, instead the emphasis is on learning to do the exercises correctly.  Learning this is extremely valuable to a Pilates practice, but once you get the movements down, this DVD is quickly outgrown.  I'm glad I only rented it because I probably won't use it again, since I already know the basics and require a somewhat more challenging workout.  However, I rate it five stars because it is so valuable to those who are totally new to the practice and not in shape.

For some people, this DVD will be way too easy even if they have never taken Pilates.  I also recommend Ana's Beginning Mat Workout, which still contains a lot of instruction and modification options for beginners, but is more challenging and has more exercises.",1111622400,63,1472,4.688715953307393
1991687,2,B0001DHSFQ,This DVD was simply an overview to Pilates it would have been better if there was an extended workout included or different people doing intermediate and difficult. The pausing in between moves to explain the positions was helpful but it just broke up the workout so you finish feeling you have had the easiest workout ever...i guess it is better then sitting on the sofa! i would reccommend Denise Austin's Power Yoga,1109376000,4,418,4.819444444444445
1991688,4,B0001DHSFQ,"I have just completed my second workout with this DVD. It is for real beginners, but is great if you are just starting out on pilates like me. Ana Caban goes through all the basics slowly, I found it very helpful in isolating my powerhouse.
After my workout yesterday I felt it...there are a few moves that I find challenging as I am not very flexible. I have just had my second c-section, so some workouts are just impossible for me. Anyone needing a bit of a challenge sould not get this, but if you are like me (just staring out...it is great) another great one is Gaiam's ""Pilates for beginners"". It has 3 people at different levels that are all doing the same routine, so you can work up to the advanced level all with the one DVD, it also goes through the fundamentals step by step first.
I will most likely only use this DVD until I get a bit more limber and then move onto something a bit more challenging. One more thing...if you have both a VCR and a DVD player, get the VHS tape as there is no extras on the DVD...just the workout. save yourself some money!!
Best of luck!!",1088467200,28,1084,4.266990291262136

8010663,5,B0001DHSFQ,Ana takes the time to explain what Pilates is about and the reasoning behind the various positions as she demonstrates them. It is done at a pace that I can follow and it is only 25 minutes. I have other Pilates materials but I like this one the best.,1435536000,,251,4.142857142857143
8010664,4,B0001DHSFQ,"This video will almost certainly bore anyone who is already proficient in pilates, but it is perfect for anyone who just wants to get a taste of what pilates is about.  I would especially recommend it to anyone who has limited flexibility and range of motion but wants to try pilates as a way of getting their mobility back.

If you're experienced in pilates, you've already mastered all of this; but if you're new to pilates, this is a good gateway that will not get too demanding too quickly.",1430784000,,494,4.53932584269663
8010665,1,B0001DHSFQ,"You watch it once then highly unlikely to do so again .
It would have been helpful if there was a menu where you can skip to the exercises or certain Pilate pose. It does not. It has one play button and you have to fast forward to the part where you want to concentrate on.
I could have rented it from the library since it's designed for one time viewing.",1418083200,,355,4.014084507042254
8010666,5,B0001DHSFQ,"After reading some of the more negative reviews for this product I was hesitant to buy this but I am very glad I did.  I think this is a wonderful DVD for Pilates beginners.  She explains the fundamentals before you actually start working out which is important with Pilates.

I am out of shape but this really is an easy DVD to begin with.  Personally, I broke a sweat using it and Pilates is low impact compared to some other types of workout but I always feel energized and refreshed after doing Pilates.  I highly recommend this if you are out of shape and new to Pilates and can't afford classes like me.  I also recommend 10 Minute Solution Pilates for Beginners to add a little variety.",1402876800,,693,4.417322834645669
8010667,5,B0001DHSFQ,"A good DVD to start learning Pilates with, easy enough for a beginner but provides a good workout with the focus on proper movements and form.

Though it ""seems"" easier if you follow what is going on and do the moves it is a good workout.",1397606400,,238,4.173913043478261
8010668,5,B0001DHSFQ,I received my DVD in a very good condition & very fast. I will certainely consider ordering more in futue. Thank you,1314316800,,116,4.318181818181818
8010669,1,B0001DHSFQ,"Easy is the right word.  Ridiculously easy.  This is for someone who has never done a pilates move in their life and knows nothing about pilates.  But even if that is the case, as long as you have half a brain, you'll outgrow this dvd in about 3 watchings.",1237248000,,256,4.183673469387755
8010670,4,B0001DHSFQ,"I am just starting pilates. I have a few other pilates dvd that I just started using. The instructor starts the dvd with the breakdown of definition for words that are used in pilates.  The instructor shows how to do the movement two ways: the beginner and the advanced. Overall very good dvd for beginners. I have been using this dvd for about three weeks. Each time I complete this dvd I feel relaxed. That dvd is great for me. I gave it 4 out 5 stars because it is very short, but that's the only negative.",1216771200,2,509,4.247422680412371
