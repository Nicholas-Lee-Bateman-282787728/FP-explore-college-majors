8107034,1,B000E89DGA,"If you are familiar with the Ruger MK1 & MK2 it will be easier for you to understand the dissasembly/assembly of this great gun.
In the other hand, if you don't know nothing about this pistol this Video tape or a DVD, won't be of any help because is confusing, poor camera close ups and a not ""to great"" help from the instructor explaning how the gun works. Long tape, slow and boooring talking by the instructor.
AGI needs to shape up and start making better instructional Videos/DVD and choose better Instructors and camera close ups. There are much better instructional videos out there.",1238803200,4,590,4.6826923076923075
