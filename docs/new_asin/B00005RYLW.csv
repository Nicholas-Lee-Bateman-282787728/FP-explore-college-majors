1657920,4,B00005RYLW,"I became interested in trying Yoga after realizing that stretching was the most enjoyable part of my workout program.  I had never done yoga prior to watching this video.  I felt very relaxed after doing the poses and watching the video.  I skipped the props and used a pillow instead of the bolster.  Make sure you have an open space and there is view from a wall to your tv because there are a lot of wall poses.  The twisting was confusing because it's hard to focus on the moves and all of the direction involved, but overall I think I will get it with practice!",1156291200,4,566,4.30188679245283
1657921,2,B00005RYLW,"I'm disappointed with this DVD for several reasons.  I was expecting a calming session like the one in ""Yoga for Beginners,"" but this one moves rather quickly, with cheesy, distracting, somewhat upbeat music.  Walden's instruction is rushed, and on my sound system the music rather overwhelms her voice.  She doesn't use ""mirror image"" cueing on this one, so that when she stretches out her right leg and you stretch out your right leg, you end up bending in opposite directions.  I find this confusing and hard to follow, especially when it comes to the twisting poses.  The other thing that really bugs me is all the props you need---not mentioned on the DVD cover, of course.  To do this workout as presented, we absolute beginners need a blanket (easy), two blocks (okay, sure), a real yoga strap, not just a tie (hmmm) and a bolster (these cost $45!).  Oh, and a handy empty wall right near your DVD player for lots of the poses.  The fold-out pose guide comes nowhere near to containing all the poses presented on the DVD, either.  There is good material in here, and Walden is obviously an excellent instructor, but the whole package does not work for me.  What happened to elegant simplicity?",1121126400,48,1200,4.725961538461538
1657922,4,B00005RYLW,"This DVD is a good start for anyone who has absolutely NO experience with Yoga.  It is easy to use, the pace is slow for those who need it, and it includes a fairly good number of exercises for the beginner to practice.  However, I thought it would be a good supplement to my regular classes, but found that I quickly outgrew it.",1098662400,14,329,4.2063492063492065
1657923,5,B00005RYLW,"First of all, let me say that Patricia Walden is awe-inspiring and that she radiates an almost preternatural calmness, which makes any of her programs soothing and relaxing to watch even if you don't actually try the poses.
As for this DVD, I started working with Patricia Walden's earlier release, Yoga for Beginners, and then bought this DVD from another company after seeing it listed as ""Yoga for Beginners II"" (which the other company claims will be the new name for the video).  While there is some overlap between the two programs, they are very complementary and go nicely together.  However, this is really more of a Pre-Yoga for Beginners program than a ""II.""  The poses are generally (but not always) less difficult than the poses in Yoga for Beginners, and the standing forward bend is done in a very modified form.  However, this program focuses much more on seated poses and twists than Yoga for Beginners does, and helps to increase and broaden one's exposure to the yoga practice.  Also, there is somewhat more of a focus on the ""flow"" of the poses in this program than in Yoga for Beginners.  The one real drawback to this DVD is that the explanation of each pose and the time given to the student to change from one pose to the next seem somewhat short, and I sometimes find myself hurrying to try to keep up, but I suppose that's why DVD players have pause and ""rewind"" keys on their remotes.
I recommend this video to anyone who is fairly new to yoga and wants a soothing and not-too-intimidating program, and to anyone who has been working with Yoga for Beginners and wants to learn more about the seated poses and twists.  However, with this DVD or with any other yoga program I have found, I also recommend that you purchase a good, basic yoga book so that you can read pose descriptions and look at pictures on a much slower and more detailed level, so that you will better understand how the poses should feel.  ""Total Yoga"" by Tara Fraser is a very good basic book which I found both helpful and enjoyable, and ""Yoga - The Path to Holistic Health"" by B.K.S. Iyengar is also very helpful for the beginner.  The Iyengar book is especially helpful for some of the more basic poses because of its 360-degree photographs and detailed instructions as to corrections to be made and points to watch for when practicing.
Namaste, and a peaceful practice to all.",1041638400,127,2378,4.61611374407583

7952747,2,B00005RYLW,"I wore out my antique tape version of the first Yoga For Beginners, but this follow-up went into the recycling bin.  First, I don't want (or expect) advertising at the beginning of any kind of workout DVD.  Second, there's too much Pretty Stuff and not enough solid instruction.  Third, the poses are mostly floor asanas, and not ones I would have chosen for a gentle beginner's DVD.  There are better DVDs out there.  Don't waste your money.",1191110400,5,442,4.688311688311688
7952748,5,B00005RYLW,"If you've never done yoga, this is the DVD for you. Patricia Walden is very good at explaining things and giving you options as you grow in your practice.  Some of her imagery is hard to digest for me, but in general, she is a good teacher.  The putting it all together section is a nice 16 minute practice for those who are time crunched or still in the beginner stages.  There are also sections for flexibility with back bends and forward bends.  I thought this section would be for more advanced students, but it's in the same vein as the rest of the DVD with beginner instruction with props and advanced without props.  Holding the poses for a bit of time is also interesting because you actually get to listen to your body and feel what is happening as you are doing the pose.  There is something to be said for this kind of yoga.",1188777600,2,835,4.32051282051282
