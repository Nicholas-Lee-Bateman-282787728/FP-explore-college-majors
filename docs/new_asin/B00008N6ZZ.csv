1853236,5,B00008N6ZZ,"""Absolutely Fabulous"" originally aired this special entitled ""White Box"" during the Christmas season on December 25th, 2004. In the episode Edina decides she wants to remodel the kitchen, but can't decide on what colors or design to go with. She calls on her old friends Bettina and Max for help (they had originally been on ""Ab Fab"" during the second year in the episode entitled ""New Best Friends""). Nathan Lane makes an excellent appearance during the special and Eddie and Patsy are their usual crazy selves, knocking back cocktails and cigarettes like they were coming out of style. This episode is the official last show of the series. Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley would reprise their roles for a skit on the BBC's Comic Relief program in 2005, but the rest of the ""Ab Fab"" cast was absent. This DVD contains the bonuses ""How To Be Absolutely Fabulous"" which is a behind-the-scenes documentary on the show; ""Ab Fab Moments"" is a skit when Edina looks back on her life via a series of flashbacks on the show; and finally ""Modern Mother and Daughter"" which is a sketch originally broadcast on the BBC's ""French and Saunders"" series that launched ""Absolutely Fabulous"". Hopefully someday the girls will return either in a movie version of ""Ab Fab"" or perhaps more seasons will be produced. This is one of the funniest and original sitcoms ever made in the history of televison broadcasting. Here's to you Edina and Patsy!",1260403200,,1431,4.868852459016393

1853264,1,B00008N6ZZ,"Please read & re-read all of the reviews for this item.  Fans are clearly divided & you may have a hard time deciding for yourself.  I have been a fan of this show since it began (as well as ""French & Saunders"" before AbFab even existed) & can still watch every episode as if it were new.  Funny, funny, funny.  It never gets old.

I have been waiting for this on DVD forever as I never got to see it on TV.  The so-called ""lost"" episode of a favourite TV series I'd hoped for.  ""White Box"", however, does *NOT* make for a ""graceful bow"" as a series finale & loses its appeal instantly after the first scene (with the goat & the unexpected Leo Sayer reference!), only when Bo & Marshall show up do we get a temporary reprieve.  The remainder of the episode is watered-down, unfunny rehash of plots we've seen before in this show.  Patsy is barely used in this episode, more or less just a ""prop"" of sorts the way it plays out & Saffy (rather, the actress portraying Saffy!) just looks like she's ready for the misery to end.  Even guest star Nathan Lane failed to make me laugh, which is rare.  AbFab guest stars are normally icing on the cake.  And Laurie Metcalf...it's too sad for words.  It's that same obnoxious, scatterbrained character she played on ""Roseanne"" for NO apparant reason.  Cross-series rehash!!!  By the time she showed up, I was ready to press ""stop"" on the DVD player...but watched the train wreck all the way to the end, praying it wouldn't end with such a whimper.  Couldn't help but think how clever & charming ""Cold Turkey"" was & how it should have been where the series ended, if it had to end at all.

Have you ever heard of an artist fufilling a contractual obligation, like a book or an album they ""have"" to release to avoid breach of contract?  That's what ""White Box"" feels like.  No new ideas, no new spins and, as I said, no apparant reason for being on the TV screen.  For the first time ever, I could see why it grated on some people's nerves for being so obnoxious.  No new extras, even...just recycled bits from other DVD releases.  It's just downright insulting to me, overall.

Jennifer Saunders has stated she in no way, shape or form wants to write these characters again & successfully killed my interest in future AbFab projects with this one episode.  Perhaps that was her intention...we may never know.  I am always willing to hope Jennifer Saunders changes her mind, but I am not going to hold my breath & will bury this DVD far away from anyone who loves ""Absolutely Fabulous"".  I will continue to enjoy the remainder of the show as I always have.",1208390400,,2595,4.444915254237288
1853265,4,B00008N6ZZ,"I love Absolutely Fabulous and this was the last DVD I needed to complete my collection, so of course I bought it.  It wasn't as funny as say series 2 or 3, but it definitely had it's moments and if you're a hardcore AbFab fan like me, you can't not have this in your collection.",1207872000,,279,4.072727272727272
1853266,5,B00008N6ZZ,No comedy television show has ever been so perfectly dead-on in its satire of a particular time and observations of a society obsessed with fashion trend and celebrity.  This episode with its demented take on designers will rank as one of the series best.  Miranda Richardson's character Batina is cruelly hysterical.,1206576000,,317,5.196078431372549
1853267,4,B00008N6ZZ,"Wow! I laughed out loud so many times watching this episode! While picking up where the Christmas episode ended, Saffie is heading to Africa to get married to Jon and Eddie isn't going. Eddie gets her itch to change things  as she always does and Patsie is just there.... SO, while I thought it was very funny there seemed to be some rushed and under developed areas of the plot. I felt the episode didn't address Saffie's problem with suddenly being in a harem or what she plans to do with Jon. Also after Eddie slaps Lola, what is resolved between the relationship of Grandma to Grandaughter that season five was all about? The use of Max and Betina was nice, but when we last saw them they were not minimalists any longer. They were clutter central, so I had  a hard time with that? And when Patsy is holding on to her the door to the living room so desperately, one feels that she almost thinks of Saffie as family and the house being her home as well. The episode felt unfinished, like  we should be expecting another series or at least another special really soon. I know that it sounds like I had a problem with the episode, but I think that I love Patsie and Eddie so much I have OVER INVESTED in their fictional lives and want to see more of them!",1205625600,,1256,4.313559322033898
1853268,5,B00008N6ZZ,great final episode of abfab if you love the seriers and the specials this is a must have,1204156800,,89,4.0
1853269,1,B00008N6ZZ,"I've been a fan of ""AbFab"" for many, many years now and look forward to each successive volume with much excitement. ""White Box"" is being touted as the final episode, but we've all heard that before, so who knows.

What I do know, however, is how disappointing ""White Box"" is and what a travesty it would be if this remained the finale to one of the funniest television comedies ever to slam martinis on the airwaves.

The largest single problem with this episode is the writing. To begin with, the two plots: Saffy's getting married and Edina wants to redo the kitchen. Both of these plots have been done on the show already. Saffy had a wedding in ""The Last Shout"" and Edie redid her kitchen in ""Doorhandle."" So the plot receives no points for originality. I know it's common for writers to steal from each other ... but from one's own pen?

What's worse, however, is how entire sequences are so frustratingly incomplete.

For example, Saffy gets married about five minutes into the program then announces a hugely important problem ... only for it, and the wedding, to be never spoken of again. What did Saffy do about it? Does her mother even find out about the marriage crisis? Who knows? I sure don't from watching ""White Box.""

Bo and Marshall show up. Nice. It's always fun to see them, however they don't really do much this time. Why are they even there? They announce that they're being chased by the FBI ... and then they promptly vanish. No one sees or even talks about them ever again. It's simply just a big case of What's the Point? Why introduce a character if they're not going to do anything?

And then the finale of course. I notice a lot of reviewers are upset over the scene where Edie strikes her grandchild, but that just seems a poor reaction on the fans' side. This is a woman who spends her life drinking to the point of passing out, doing drugs constantly, and humiliating and belittling her daughter in front of everyone. And you get upset because she slaps her grandchild? Hmm. Needless to say, it happens off-screen and is used only as a catalyst to launch the episode into its final, dreary scene.

I'm not going to describe the final scene, other than to ask, what kind of an ending is that? Is that really how Edie and Patsy end up? What happened to those scenes of them together in the house as old women? The show cannot possibly end on this note.

I found this episode to be so incomplete that I literally thought I had only received part one on the DVD. But, alas. That's all she wrote. ""AbFab"" deserves better. Here's hoping for series 6.",1203638400,,2577,4.4914529914529915
1853270,5,B00008N6ZZ,"People are always comparing these specials with the earlier episodes sounding as if they are not really fans of the series, wanting it to be more than it is.  I am not at all disappointed with this final special.  Though there is a limit to how far some things can be funny, this was a perfect end to the series, which I thought had come in 1996 with ""The Last Shout.""  I'm glad it didn't end there.

This final special is wonderful in that it takes the true fan to further extremes, and not everyone gets it.  This series is about humorous extremes.  The bit with the redecoration of her kitchen is hilarious, if one understands these kinds of creative people and how eccentric extremes can be taken in the most practical situations.  Having remodelled my own kitchen, a four month project became 3 years, and I was waiting for it to tell me what it needed.  Now I know all I had to do was get regressed to find my answers.

The ending is a bit controversial to some, but very fitting, and where they end up is incredibly poetic.  This is for the true fan of the series, and not for realists.",1199923200,,1093,4.313725490196078
1853271,5,B00008N6ZZ,"This episode runs about normal length, but it is just hilarious.  There are several AbFab moments, and they make this DVD worth buying.  It seems to pick up right where Season 5 ended. I hope there will be more AbFab to come.",1198108800,,225,4.333333333333333
1853272,2,B00008N6ZZ,"it is uneven at best. It felt a bit rushed and the humor forced at some points. Still, Eddie and Pats are two funny ladies and there are some  gems to be found in the main title - Patsy's delayed surgical procedure, Bettina and Max's insane imagining of Eddie's kitchen. However, if you want to see the best bits of AbFab, watch Eddie's very funny video of a day of her life, spent with her Mom at the sad ole' Charity shop.",1196553600,,424,4.170731707317073
1853293,2,B00008N6ZZ,"As a devoted AbFab fan, I eagerly looked forward to this long awaited Christmas Special.  Jennifer Saunders, being the huge talent that she is, did deliver in a few instances. I found the past lives regression scene to be terribly funny, but.... most of the show seemed to be cross between rehashing of previous jokes (Patsy's bones breaking) and a struggle to include all the cameo appearances. The WORST THING about it is toward the end when Edina struck her granddaughter. I couldn't believe what I saw.  Nothing is ever funny about striking a child. In my opinion, Jennifer seriously crossed the line on that count. I can rewatch all the AbFab series and specials endlessly, except this one.",1196553600,,695,4.831932773109243
1853294,5,B00008N6ZZ,"I found White Box to be great fun and absolutely hysterical in parts.

The funny thing is that now as everyone's aged it's Edina who's the voice of reason amongst this group of eccentrics.

Unfortunately, Julia Sawalha is still allowed to play Saffy with too much anger and throws off the whole balance of the show (and the comedy).  (In the first three series she was annoyed by her mother but always clearly had tolerance, patience, and love for her, while in the later series she's just too bitter and angry ALL THE TIME for the show's own good.)

Kudos to Jennifer Saunders for getting Ab Fab back on track.  If Saffy were just tweaked a little this could be a great show again -- especially now that Edina's got a granddaughter and (flashing forward a few years) Eddie and Patsy could be a wonderful pair of Auntie Mames.

Kudos also to Laurie Metcalfe as a past life regressor.  She's proved to be quite a talent in this, even with very physical comedy like slipping out of a shiny-surfaced plastic white chair (where every single move and eye movement was perfectly choreographed).",1196467200,,1088,4.635416666666667
1853295,4,B00008N6ZZ,"Ive been a huge fan of Ab Fab for years. Like most people I have talked to, the first four series' were the best. But if you love the show, then this is a must have. Though not as witty or crazed as the first series', White Box is funny, and classic Eddie and Patsy. The ending was a big let down story wise, but I like where it left off. Thanks for the laughs ladies, and thanks for telling the world about selfish pesants.",1195603200,,424,4.0
1853296,4,B00008N6ZZ,"In this most recent installment of the British sitcom, the simple task of redoing the kitchen becomes a nightmare for Edina, (Jennifer Saunders), who sees a design in her mind's eye she can't seem to share with the world. She comes to believe her dream kitchen may be the product of one of her self-professed past lives. So let the hilarity begin.

There's a lot of AbFab schtick here; best friend Patsy, (Joanna Lumley), has another biological disorder and is equipped with a body fluid draining tube dangling from her person, (she puts the external end into a glass to preserve the alcohol); ex-husband Marshall and partner Bo, (Christopher Ryan, Mo Gaffney), make an obligatory appearance on the run from the FBI, as if doing a quick shuffle and soft shoe and then exit, and guest Nathan Lane offers a hammy and unfunny performance as an eccentric interior designer, verifying that with all it's comedic rule, AbFab is incapable of creating an equally strong comedic male character.

But like another reviewer suggested concerning the impending demise of the program, I would like to follow Edina and Patsy far into the future to that final snort and sip. When this episode is funny, it is hysterical. Minimal design minded friends Bettina and Max, (Miranda Richardson, Patrick Barker), are back to design Edina's kitchen in the 'white box' design of the title, and the scene is delightfully demented and offers a great slaptstick bit. Laurie Metcalf, as a psychic who attempts to reveal Edina's past lives is also very funny, guiding her back in time with the use of ""funny voices"". I even liked the goat scene and found it perfectly plausible that aging Patsy would believe that goats naturally speak.

The episode is a fun little pit stop while the wheels of these ladies are still smoking. Here's hoping they never surrender. Cheers!",1195516800,,1840,4.891025641025641
1853297,3,B00008N6ZZ,"But I didn't like the bit with Nathan Lane.  It just wasn't that good.

It was really funny seeing what Max and Bettina did to Eddy's kitchen... ""She can't leave, you took out the stairs!""

Cheers to finally seeing what happened with Saffy's marriage.

1853299,1,B00008N6ZZ,"AbFab was one of my favourite television series EVER. The characters were funny and the plots, though completely ridiculous, were a joy to watch. Sadly, as with all good ideas, the later series and subsequent specials suffered in quality.

There's probably a good reason as to why ""White Box"" took so long to get to home video: It was poorly received by critics and fans of the show. It's unfortunate that Jennifer Saunders took the character of Edina to a place she shouldn't have. That happens in the last ten minutes of the show. Even more unfortunate are the number of cameos and supporting characters portrayed by wonderful comedic actors. The roles were poorly written and the performances were wasted.

I'm hoping that Jennifer Saunders will just let this series go and the rest of us can just forget this last chapter of AbFab will be forgotten.  She's moved on to the shows ""The Life of Vivenne Vyle"" and ""Jam and Jerusalem"" (""Clatterford"" in the States) and is doing quite well with those. A fresh start is always good... as evidenced by the travesty that is ""White Box"". Avoid this one at all costs.",1193529600,,1110,4.711340206185567
1853300,4,B00008N6ZZ,"The 2004 ""Absolutely Fabulous"" special entitled ""White Box"" was another hilarious look into the lives of the fictional characters created originally by Jennifer Saunders (who plays Edina Monsoon) and and Dawn French (who played the original Saffy, Edina's daughter, but that role was revamped & recast for the series with Julia Sawalha).  ""White Box"" begins with Saffy planning a trip to Africa to marry the father of her child.  Edina was supposed to go, but instead remains in London with her long-time friend Patsy Stone (Joanna Lumley).  Against Saffy's wishes, Edina decides to yet again redecorate the house, starting with the kitchen.  The result: a near-featureless white room thanks to the efforts of Edina's friends Bettina (Miranda Richardson) and Max (Patrick Barlow).  Of course, Saffy is not at all happy at this latest change upon her return, but her disgust is temporarily thwarted when Bo (Mo Gaffney) and Marshall (Christopher Ryan) show up while hiding from the law due to their illegal money-collecting activities for their latest phony televangelist show in the states.  Meanwhile, Patsy has undergone a partial surgery (""pay as you go"") and is dripping profusely where ever she goes.  This time, however, Saffy may do something a bit rash to change things for herself and her young daughter.

Other returning characters included Bubble (Jane Horrocks) and Edina's mother (June Whitfield).  Guest stars included designer Terence Conran (as himself), Laurie Metcalf as a regression ""expert"" and Nathan Lane as a designer named Kunz.  Overall, ""White Box"" was a very funny, earns a rating of 4 out of 5 stars and is highly recommended to any ""Absolutely Fabulous"" aficionado.",1193443200,,1694,5.2407407407407405
1853301,2,B00008N6ZZ,"My, how far we've fallen. I remember when this show was sharp, well written and hilarious. Sadly, none of what made the original series so brilliant is on display here. What we get is a plot lifted from earlier, better episodes, secondary characters with nothing to do but make an appearance for nostalgic's sake, and a main character (Patsy) who no longer resembles herself. And it all plays out with nary a laugh in sight. How disappointing! Jennifer Saunders is an undeniable talent, but she seems determined to drag the memory of this once ground-breaking show through the dirt with these senseless ""Specials"". If you absolutely have to see this (and if you're a long time fan, you will feel like you have to), then rent it first. And be prepared to be let down.",1193270400,,766,4.681481481481481

1853303,4,B00008N6ZZ,"This ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS special originally aired during Christmas in 2004.

With Saffy (Julia Sawalha) in Africa getting married, Eddy (Jennifer Saunders) decides to renovate the kitchen...again.  She calls in her old friends Bettina and Max (Miranda Richardson and Patrick Barber), but Bettina's concept of ""white box"" soon causes more trouble than Eddy wants.  Meanwhile Patsy (Joanna Lumley) is in hospital for some ""pay as you go"" procedures.  Adding to the chaos are Marshall and Bo (Christopher Ryan and Mo Gaffney), on the run from the authorities following their latest fraudulent television ministry.

Needless to say, by the time Saffy returns home, the kitchen is still in a shocking state.  Convinced the answer lies in one of her myriad past lives, Eddy organises for a regression to find the kitchen of her dreams...

It's fun catching up with old characters Max and Bettina (previously seen in the ""New Best Friend"" episode from Season 2), plus there are some great cameo roles for Nathan Lane as an eccentric designer, and Laurie Metcalf (""Roseanne"") as Eddy's psychic medium.  Home design guru Sir Terence Conran also puts in a fleeting appearance.  And don't forget the always-hilarious Mother (June Whitfield) and Bubble (Jane Horrocks).
