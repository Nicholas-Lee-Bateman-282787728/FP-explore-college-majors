5851893,5,B00DS79HBU,"I love this movie-it is a real feel good film that the whole family can watch together! The main character,Dani,is a spoiled 18 year old whose world is turned upside down when her father is sent to prison and she must go to live with her bachelor uncle,Sam(Kevin Sorbo). Through an orphaned colt Sam gives her to train,Dani learns that caring for others is the key to solving life's problems. Beautiful scenery and a wonderful cast which includes Dani Chuchran and Kristy Swanson as Jody,Sam's love interest,makes this film one you will want to watch over and over-I wholeheartedly recommend it!",1383782400,36,595,4.900990099009901

5851898,3,B00DS79HBU,"Kevin Sorbo redeemed himself ( to some extent ) in this film about a young girl who trained a special horse.  Actually, the girl was more the star in this movie.

Swanson is a long time favorite both deliver  and Chuchran is very good a show that fits the champion equestrian well.

He's an exceptional writer, a rock solid director and has a very good eye in terms of spotting talent, especially in the way he casts kids (which is a skill unto itself.)

5852003,3,B00DS79HBU,"I just saw this movie and it only proves, once again, that the producers / directors of these ""horse"" movies need a reliable consultant. At the very beginning, it showed someone wrapping a horse's leg. BACKWARDS !!!! Then it had a lovely scene at a horse show (Arabian  Regionals in Santa Barbara) that was passed off as a Thoroughbred show. Then, as the young girl was walking down a barn aisle, not only was she carrying an Arabian National garland, but it wasn't even the garland that had been presented in the horse show ""clip"". I know that most viewers wouldn't pick up on these irregularities, but having owned and shown Arabian horses, (at Santa Barbara and the Arabian Nationals) and been on the show circuit for 30 years, this is an insult to my intelligence. Just sayin'",1401494400,3,780,4.6521739130434785
5852004,3,B00DS79HBU,"This one was utterly predictable start to finish, with a cloy plot that drags and styrofoam acting.  Still, as far as family films go it was fine, and plenty of scenes with a lovable mule and various show horses make this ideal for young kids into that kind of thing.  There's a little bit of romance - very predictable and contrived of course - but no real bad content.  In fact, I don't think there was one swear word, no major violence (there's a plane crash later in the film but with only minor injuries - you know, the little bit of blood by the side of the mouth kind of thing) and no adult content, so this is an ideal pizza-night family film if you're into that kind of thing.  If you're a film theory major, hit the Kurosawa section instead and skip this one.",1401062400,4,769,4.2465753424657535

5852023,2,B00DS79HBU,"A cute movie, and good to watch, but I was surprised by its 5 Star rating. It does have a five star message, but the acting on all accounts was pretty lame, except for the dog ~ the dog was the best one! I would recommend this for 10 to 13 year old kids because it is a cute story, and the message of love and adjusting to difficult circumstances  was a powerful one that would be great for this age group to see.",1389139200,,413,3.9166666666666665
5852024,4,B00DS79HBU,"I liked this movie because it was good and wholesome. The only reason I didn't rate it five stars, excellent, was because there were some unrealistic parts.",1389052800,,156,4.814814814814815

5852027,4,B00DS79HBU,"This is a very good all around movie. Not corny and not real heavy type of movie. It was very enjoyable, no bad language, another one about life's lessons. I gave it a 4 star simply because it is not a great movie, I reserve 5 star for movies like Man from Snowy River and this movie is not in that class.",1388620800,,305,3.935483870967742

Spoiled rich girl's father goes to prison and she has to go live with her bachelor country vet uncle.

5852032,5,B00DS79HBU,"Great, entertaining movie with an uplifting message. Kevin Sorbo and Kristy Swanson are excellent, and it's interesting to note that the female lead, Dani Cucheran, is a champion equestrian in real life. Then, the little brother is so adorable....extra sympathy for putting up with an uncaring mother.",1386892800,8,301,5.425531914893617

5852034,4,B00DS79HBU,"We enjoyed this clean movie very much.  The only reason it did not receive 5 stars was that the sound mix was unbalanced. The background music was too loud, and we could not hear the voices without turning the volume up - then the music was too loud.",1384300800,3,250,4.208333333333333

8596982,5,B00DS79HBU,"Storm Rider is a family movie that has a few twists. The movie does an excellent job portraying more family conflicts and complexities than we see in the typical family movies.

The screenplay and writing are good. Kristy Swanson has a challenging role as Jody Peterson who seems too good to be true, and she does a wonderful job making this character believable. Another standout is Danielle Chuchran who plays Dani Fielding, the difficult teenage female!!!!!!",1503792000,2,461,5.065789473684211
