8298440,3,B001EJYCPU,"The positives:  I would recommend this to anyone who is out of shape, has back or neck injuries and has never done Pilates before.  The moves are fairly well explained and not hard at all.  Anyone could do this video with ease and once they mastered this, move on to something more advanced.

The negatives: her form is not perfect in all the moves and there is no menu for navigation on the dvd.  The sound quality is not great, but it is not distracting.

There are no special exercises for Healthy Back and Joints. It is just a basic Pilates workout, which will work on your core and that is good for your back and joints.",1273017600,2,625,4.299145299145299
