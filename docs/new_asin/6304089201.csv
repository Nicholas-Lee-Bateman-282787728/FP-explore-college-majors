794687,5,6304089201,"I have this movie and it's really cool. I've seen all three Aladdin movies except I've only seen the Return of Jafar once or twice, but I'm rambling on here. Aladdin and the King of Thieves is really cool. I like the part when Kaseem says, ""Touched by the Hand of Midass."" ""And sunk by it.""",1011312000,,290,4.196428571428571

Directed by Tad Stones (The Return of Jafar, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command:The Adventures Begin) made this Clever animation and moment of dialogue make this Direct to Video Sequel worthwhile but The Genie (Voiced by Robin Williams returns from the Original Aladdin) is sometimes annoying in this but Still it`s great fun.

Aladdin (the street rat) is gunna get married to Jasmin(the princess), and discovers that his dad is still alive, and relizes his dad is the king of thieves!! Aladdin then battles to get his father back.",997747200,,313,4.508771929824562
794691,3,6304089201,"The Aladdin movies got progressively worse. Aladdin is of course, a classic, because Disney put much more effort into it (obviously) than the other two. In the two second movies, the detail gets lower and lower in quality (a.k.a. the carpet has a less intricate design, the characters faces look more cartoony...etc.) Not only in this one did the animation lack, but so did the story line. It was expected that Disney would run out of original ideas , and would have to borrow from another Arabian Nights tale. Though the voice talents were just as extraordinary, and the emotions just as strong, the plot was thin, and the overall movie was not as good as possible.",991699200,,666,4.700854700854701
794692,3,6304089201,"ALADDIN showed viewers an unforgetable world.... THE RETURN OF JAFAR was a trasy disappointment....
And now Aladdin has his final adventures as the trilogy comes to a close in this final episode, ALADDIN AND THE KING OF  THIEVES.  The best part was by far Robin Williams' return as the great blue  Geenie.  But another pleasent suprise was a fresh, orginial plot (compared  especially to THE RETURN OF JAFAR's reused plot), and entertaining new  characters (such as the Forty Thieves).
However, the music is no better  than THE RETURN OF JAFAR's.  Not even the big fanale song.  I wish we hadd  Alen Meken and Tim Rice back.  Their music for the first ALADDIN film was  extrodnary! I'll never forget how they helped Aladdin show his princess a  whole new world!  The visual effects were a  treat, though, and made up for  the loss of good music.  The Geenie's scenes were extreamly elebrate, and  the scenes featuring the Hand of Midis were also nicely done.
It was also  nice for Aladdin to find relations, but his father's excuses for not being  there for Aladdin when he needed him were extreamly poor. As bad as THE  RETURN OF JAFAR was (in my opinion). And if you've seen my review of it,  you know how I feel.
To sum everything up, ALADDIN AND THE KING OF  THIEVES was a treat, but still not as 100% classic as ALADDIN was.  It was  enjoyable to find that Disney obviously learned their lesson after the  trashy THE RETURN OF JAFAR.  (Reccomended to rent, but NOT a must-have for  your video library unless you have the other two and want to complete your  ALADDIN collection.)",961718400,8,1583,4.613718411552346
794693,4,6304089201,The King of Thieves was a great movie but needed a little more Genie in it. I just love movies with action and romance in it but it needed a little more humor. I would recommend this movie to anyone 7 or over.  When  Aladdin and Jasmine finally get married I went over to my boyfriend's house  and showered him with kisses.,952473600,,323,4.17741935483871
794694,2,6304089201,"I must admit, Robin Williams is always a great deal of fun, but as much as I love his character.. and believe him to be so very talented, the poor man was the *whole* movie! Yes, the plot was formidable, but honestly.. most of  it was just the genie (albeit well played). The animation can't compare to  the original and neither can the end. It gived the story far too much  closure for a fairy tale.",950227200,,400,4.2368421052631575

795053,5,6304089201,"First of all..I'm a FAN of the Aladdin series by Disney. The first one was released the same year I was born. Watched it when I was about 5 years old, and ever since then..grew watching the rest. The first was amazing! The second one was just ""OK"". But now, the third one....this one is the exception. No I know what can be expected from a DTV movie..especially if it's a Disney movie. But this movie has is own merits to be, not only entertaining..but also great! The story is original and the villains are as well. I liked the darker tone on this one. The movie starts off at the long awaited wedding of Aladdin and Jasmin. Then suddenly it's interrupted by the infamous ""40 thieves"". Now, from all the stories i have seen and read from the 40 thieves, this adaptation by Disney is by far the best!
The movie introduces us some new colorful and very well developed characters. The story is great and the twist is awesome. The animation is better than ""return of Jafar"" but not enough to be compared to the first movie...for obvious reasons..But it is still good animation..certainly better thatn other Disney DTV.
My personal favorite scene was in a specific fight between Aladdin and ""the bad guy"". To me it was a complete transition from what we are all used to. But this particular scene was pretty dark and I liked that tone. You can't have an epic fight being just hugs and some pushes..this was a hardcore (for Disney standards at least) fight. And one of the characters actually gets wounded..no blood of course..but still very good scene.
The ending was also great. A little unpredictable, at least until a couple of minutes before the climax.
The genie does what he does best and that is give the movie the humor that made the first movie great.  Thank to MR. Williams for such great work.
The epilogue of the movie was  a surprised to see an ""old"" character back from the first movie to tie up trilogy.
The songs are, for me, GREAT! except for one between Aladdin and his .......(spoiler)
Also the background provided on Aladdin's child days was a surprised. A good surprised.
The movie is great add on to your collection. YOU CAN'T MISS THIS ONE.",1452643200,,2159,4.5475578406169666

This movie was a great way to tie up and end the series, with the wedding of Aladdin and Jasmine that we were so longingly waiting for. The voices in this movie are wonderful, and they got back most of the original cast. The jokes are still just as fun like when Genie is jumping out of the plan and goes ""Geronimo. Arapaho. Pocahontas.""

I love the voice of Aladdin's father, and extension of the story but doing more than one Arabian Night tale in the same series, since, after-all Aladdin is one of the Arabian Night tales (that is why they named the song that, it is an inside joke for all readers).

Family fun and friendly movie with the best conclusion to a Disney series yet.",1387238400,,876,4.329268292682927

795721,2,6304089201,"You know, after about two movies, eighty-seven episodes, and countless spin-offs, you kind of have to get tired of something unless it holds up flawlessly for the longest time. Aladdin just ain't so. The King of Thieves' actual expectations and ambitions really weren't that high, in that it served to be a finale to the Aladdin TV series (and to the whole thing in general), in comparison to the Return of Jafar being the pilot for it. So in a way, we have the slightly obnoxious TV series to thank for this. Here's the unfortunate part - there's really nothing that Aladdin and the King of Thieves really adds. Return of Jafar definitely tied up loose ends; while there was no need for THAT, there certainly was no need for eighty-seven episodes and a third movie.

Unfortunately, it shows, and it's unfortunate; there are definite ways in which King of Thieves is BETTER than the Return of Jafar. The animation is a lot more richer and sleeker, even if it is still at that sub-par level which spat on the second film. The colors are better, the movement is more focused, so that's definitely an improvement. However, in almost every other area, it fails in comparison; the performance, the story, the music, and in some cases the humor.

The story goes like this: Aladdin and Jasmine are ready to have a weddin', but then they're target of a raid by the fabled, inept 40 Thieves; a bunch of second-rate criminals who sing. They're after some kind of ancient oracle that Aladdin has; and from the very oracle, which apparently knows everything (yeah, that's sparkling), it turns out the leader of these 40 Thieves is Aladdin's father, Cassim. It then launches into an 80+ minute adventure about Aladdin and the 40 Thieves, dealing with greed and money, and a bunch of familial issues. Yeah, there's nothing much else besides that.

The biggest problem with the King of Thieves is pretty much this: it's NOT interesting. Despite it's story having a better concept than the Return of Jafar, the execution just feels repetitive and it more or less just feels like a long telemovie. Robin Williams finally returns, after being evidently absent from the last movie, but he serves for nothing more than to serve gag-worthy gags. There are a lot of good wedding jokes he makes, but after that beginning, it just gets... boring. Genie serves no purpose. Cassim is thankfully a decent enough character to support this story arc; he's got that personality that makes you want to love him, despite the fact that he ditched our hero. The series' new villain, a gray-skinned, abnormally strong, stupid man named Sa'luk... he's just purely there because they need a villain. Jafar was interesting because he had a personality that was interesting in its pure evil nature; Sa'luk wants power, and money, and fame, and he has such little personality that I end up not giving a damn about him. When compared to Jafar, hell, any villain, he's got no development or center of interest.

Musically, King of Thieves also does a lot worse. It opens with a Genie-led song, ""A Party In Agrabah""; it's good to see Robin Williams back, but all of the gags just end up flat. When we are introduced to the 40 Thieves, they sing a little ditty called ""Welcome To The Forty Thieves"", arguably the film's worst. It's got an all-too familiar melody, bad rhymes, and just plain sucks; there's nothing funny nor clever about it. Genie's second song, ""Father and Son"" is far too light-hearted and predictable to be worth of any real value; it has some good woodwinds, I suppose, but it conveys the same idea as the previous track I mentioned; dull, throwaway, unmemorable. Sa'luk gets his moment in ""Are You In Or Out?"", which is supposed to be a 'rousing' call to action. While the big guy does have some clever lines when he begins, the minute the remnants of the 40 Thieves join in, it instantly just sucks.

The only piece that holds some promise is 'Out Of Thin Air', a slow, string-led piece in 2. It's the first duet between Aladdin and Jasmine that isn't love, and despite its painfully familiar lines, it's a beautiful little piece. It's a shame the vibe and prose of this track didn't carry over into the rest of it.

Despite my ranting of it, King of Thieves is far from terrible; it does things better than Return of Jafar, but it also does things worse. At best, it serves a way to wrap things up with a few moments of brilliance and humor. At worst, it serves an as unwelcome distraction with a second rate story made with profoundly second rate execution. (Pun not intended) It is at least better than a multitude of Disney sequels that followed it - for more than a damn decade - and does have one lovable character, it could of been done so much better.",1347753600,,4737,4.65352449223417
795722,5,6304089201,"This was a lot better than the second film released in the Aladdin series by far.

Look at the part where the genie is singing father and son song and it shows a bunch of squares with them surrounded by the genie kinda like the brady bunch thing, you can see how their cut out of the picture at the top and bottom.

795906,3,6304089201,"Aladdin and the King of Thieves is one hour and twenty minutes and released on video on August 13, 1996. This was the second and last sequel to the original Aladdin movie and in my opinion The Return of Jafar was better of the two sequels. The basic story is that Aladdin and Princess Jasmine are getting married and Aladdin feels empty because his parents are not around to enjoy this day. Aladdin finds out that his father is still alive and goes on a quest to find him and rescue him from the Forty Thieves. Aladdin finds out that is his father Cassim is the King of Thieves. Father and son reunite and go looking for the Hand of Midas. Find the Hand and Cassim realizes that his greatest gift is his son, tosses the hand into the sea. Aladdin and Princess Jasmine get married while Cassim watches from a distance because he is still a criminal. Cassim and Iago ride off to the sunset. To get a better dicription of this movie go to this website: [...]. For me this was nothing more then Genie singing and showing off during the entire movie and some of Robin Williams scenes could have been left on the cutting room floor. Also there is a major goof in this movie as well. At the end of Aladdin, Genie is given his freedom and his arm bands were removed. In this film however, the genie still has his arm bands. Even in the Return of Jafar there are no arm bands on Genie's wrists. During the first thirty minutes there was one musical number after another and some could have been left out. Aladdin and the King of Thieves only get a C from me.

795909,3,6304089201,"The big day has finally arrived.  The entire kingdom has turned out for Aladdin (Scott Weinger) and Jasmine's (Linda Larkin) wedding.  Thanks to the Genie (Robin Williams), it looks to be a spectacular day.

But then tragedy strikes.  The 40 Thieves attack the wedding and try to steal just one present.  Yes, that's right.  But that present turns out to be an oracle that will answer one question.  And through that oracle, Aladdin learns that his father is still alive.

What he doesn't realize is that his father, Cassim (John Rhys-Davies), is the leader of the thieves.  The family reunion pits Aladdin against Sa'luk (Jerry Orbach) who isn't happy with the way that Cassim has been running the gang.  How will Jasmine react to the identity of Aladdin's father?  Can Aladdin reform his dad?  And how many different Disney movies can Robin Williams reference?

This movie was better then I remembered.  Having Robin Williams back as the voice of Genie really made a huge difference.  And his many Disney references absolutely cracked me up.  The story moved along fairly quickly, when it wasn't sabotaged by the songs.  While some of the songs were fun in the last one, here they are all boring.  They should have taken them out and just let the movie be that much shorter.

This is still only an average follow up to a great film.  But fans of the original will enjoy it, and it will keep kids entertained.",1196121600,2,1410,4.700819672131147
795910,4,6304089201,"I was really pleased (and relieved) that ""Aladdin and the King of Thieves"" was a well-made sequel, especially after the embarrassing debacle of the straight-to-video ""The Return of Jafar"". I rented ""Jafar"" when it was released, watched it for the first 15 mins., then turned off the VCR in disgust. Everything about it was cheap: cheap story, cheap animation, and cheap execution. It was barely up to Saturday morning cartoon fare, let alone Disney's high standards. Especially disappointing was the exclusion of the comic genius of Robin Williams; didn't Disney realize his voice IS the Genie? A glaring oversight on their part.
Thank goodness they made up for it with this concluding sequel to the Aladdin saga. While a notch below the original, AATKOT restored most of the magic missing from ""Jafar"".
The subplot of Aladdin getting to know his long-lost, charmingly roguish father was well-handled and poignant. But as with the original film, Williams stole the show as the mischievous and all-powerful Genie, a perfect character for Williams to morph from one impersonation and/or satirical situation into another.
I had it on VHS, but definitely want it on DVD to add to my Disney collection. A fitting conclusion to one of Disney's most treasured animated films.",1187049600,21,1268,5.130434782608695
795911,4,6304089201,"All the Disney DTV sequels--or, as we sometimes refer to them in our homes, ""cheap-quels""--have been bad.  Or horrible.  My problem with most of them is not actually with the movie itself, but with the all-but-inevitable leeching off of the original. Continuing a story that's already resolved or telling the same story as the first one are the M.O. for your average cheapquel--not remotely entertaining, just a ploy to make money

The surprising thing about this movie is the fact that it ISN'T your average cheapquel. There may be an element of nostalgia in this review, but watching it again recently, I was surprised at how much of it still actually stood up as a decent movie, with actual quality in it.  Despite the unavoidable stealing from the previous movies, this one actually DOES present some new material--and much of the story told is very creative and interesting.  The new characters add a dimension to the old characters and the world that they inhabit, rather than simply ripping off or rehashing the first or second movie.  The forty thieves and Caseem are interesting with their individual ways of fighting and talking.  The Vanishing Isle is especially amazing, coming in a DTV feature, and the Oracle, despite some flaws, has an amazingly cool design and quality effects surrounding it.  That sort of thought in character and design is exactly the kind of thing that the original Disney encouraged.  Also, this movie didn't contradict already-existing characters' traits; this is another of my pet peeves.  Aladdin was clearly himself, with no made-up flaws or strengths added to him--the same goes for the Genie and even Jasmine, Abu, Carpet, and Iago.  (The only exception was Jasmine's sudden expertise in karate, but I suppose this was because it was the 90's, when every female was a black-belt--no matter their background or age.)

The fact that they made the movie stand (relatively) alone is a great tribute to the makers as well.  The original plan was to use a character from the TV show, Mozenrath, and reveal him to be Aladdin's brother.  The fact that they had the confidence in their own storytelling abilities to scrap that plan and go with introducing Aladdin's father made the film much more interesting, opening up more possibilities for the story and the characters.  Many of the sequences in the film are amazingly creative--again, see the Vanishing Isle sequence--and many of them are actually moving--the Challenge is surprisingly gripping, with effects like rim lighting and shadows.

  The animation, all in all, is better than your average TV show--which is what the animators were used to working on.  The music, especially the score, performs surprisingly well for what its status in a cheapquel movie would entail.  The voices, especially Caseem, Saluk, and of course the Genie (Robin Williams is back!) gave the movie, again, something new.

All in all, this movie is surprisingly well done, in every sense.  Though not feature quality, it's the only one of its kind that seems to get past being the sequel to a very successful movie, offering new material and creative ideas.  For what it should have been, it is amazingly good.  I'd at least give it a rent, if not a buy--even if it does drift to the back of your video drawer, it's a pleasant surprise to pull out on a rainy day.",1183161600,,3333,4.910714285714286
795912,4,6304089201,"Aladdin and the King of Thieves is a great film.  The best character is Aladdin's long-lost father - Cassim, the leader of the legendary forty thieves.  A little Temple of Doom, a little swashbuckling, a little Sinbad, great costume designs, a lot of action and adventure, and a surprisingly thoughtful script.  A must-have for Disney and Aladdin fans.

The story begins as Al and Jasime prepare to be wed.  The wedding is interrupted by the mysterious King of Thieves, after a treasure in Jasmine's wedding gifts.  Aladdin seeks to have a relationship with his father, but how can he if their lifestyles are so different?  Or are they really the same?  Like real life, nothing is cut-and-dry or simple about this reunion.  Really well-done, and Robin Williams provides great comic relief.

But probably the biggest disappointment was that Robin Williams, the perfect Genie, was gone.  It was little more than a long Saturday morning cartoon.
""Aladdin and the King of Thieves,"" on the other hand, is a surprisingly well-made and entertaining direct-to-video cartoon sequel.  Not only did the creators return Robin Williams to do his excellent job as Genie, but they also cast none other than John Rhys-Davies (Indiana Jones, The Lord of the Rings) as Cassim, Aladdin's long-lost father.  Their acting is the best part of the film.
While the animation is by no means as good as that of the original ""Aladdin,"" it is fairly well-done, and much better than that of ""Return of Jafar.""  The locales and characters are colorful and original.  The songs of the movie are only so-so, but the music is better.  The storyline with its plot-turns moves along fairly well and keeps the viewer's interest as Aladdin and company search for Cassim's coveted treasure, the Hand of Midas.
All in all, the Aladdin trilogy is redeemed from the failures of the middle chapter by this surprisingly well-made and entertaining film.  Hopefully, the entire trilogy will one day be available on DVD.",1089331200,11,1346,4.920353982300885

The Return of Jafar wasn't that great because of a lack of effort on the part of the animators and writers.  Aladdin & the King of Theives wasn't great because it was missing the villain of the series; and he wasn't replaced with someone equally interesting.  The villain in this movie, if you could call him that, was a minor character who had no real motivation to do what he did and certainly no goals in mind.",1069718400,,653,4.336065573770492

Released early on before Disney decided to defile it animated classics, Aladdin and the King of Thieves features a solid, new storyline that does not simply rehash the original. Maybe this extra attempt at quality was made to get Robin Williams to reprise one of his coolest roles? After two movies and countless tv episodes, Aladdin and Jasmine are finally getting married. Then the forty thieves show up and trash the wedding, and Aladdin goes on a quest to find his father and a unique treasure with the golden touch. While not targeted to older kids like Disney's Atlantis was, this movie is slightly darker than the two that came before it, which is a good thing. A lot of this comes from the forty thieves, who sing about robbing, plundering, in an endearing kind of way. There is a sword duel conveyed in hellish reds, murky blues, and shadows, and lightning is used to symbolize Aladdin being wounded. And the villain's demise is quite original, not the usual ""falling to their death"" we've seen over and over. In fact, I daresay Atlantis even borrowed the demise for their film's climax. All in all, it's an entertaining, never-boring, thrill ride, and ties up the saga nicely, with a nod to the street merchant who began this whole thing.
The songs in Aladdin and the King of Thieves are not up the quality of the original, but they are much better than all the other Disney DTV's. The two songs the forty thieves sing are quite hilarious and memorable, the romance song didn't make me cringe at all, and the opening number gets the ball rolling really well. The only semi-clunker is the father and son song, but that wasn't bad either. The animation isn't cinema-quality, but it's also above-average and commendable. My only curiosity with this movie is some of the Genie's jokes. The animators went with whatever ad-libs Robin Williams came up with, and even after six years of watching this movie, I still can't understand most of them, especially the homages to past comedians. This is the only part children won't understand.
Aladdin and the King of Thieves is a high-quality Disney DTV, and as things stand, their ONLY high-quality release ever. Worth picking up on video, or even on the eventual DVD release.",1027555200,36,2478,4.778554778554779
