What an absolutely lovely story...gently paced with a great cast.  The best part is that it's true...about Michael Palin's grandfather...the story garnered from diaries.
I had been looking for yrs for this title on dvd & finally found it!  It's a keeper!
This is Michael Palen in wonderful form...  He is quite versatile, comedian, actor, writer, explorer, etc.",1261267200,,603,7.232876712328767
8070867,5,B0009ZERUU,"Francis Ashby (Michael Palin) a middle-aged Oxford tutor on a hiking trip in Switzerland in 1861. There he meets the American Caroline Hartley (Connie Booth) and her 18-year old ward Elinor (Trini Alvarado). Ashby is drawn to them both, particularly Elinor, and therefore, he is rather surprised when they arrive in Oxford and intend to stay...

The plot was based on a real-life incident involving Palin's great-grandfather, Edward Palin.

It is truly the best film I have ever seen, remarkably moving and touching - a delightful production.
Michael Palin is truly one of the finest actors ever and I must thank him for sharing the story of his great-grandfather with us.",1247529600,,672,5.045045045045045
