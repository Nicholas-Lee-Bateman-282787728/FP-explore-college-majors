Another WONDERFUL product by Monta Briant. You will find personal stories you can relate to, and the real hands on how to sign with your baby
This DVD will provide everything you need to need about signing with babies and children - it is like taking a workshop at your home. The information was very flowing and easy to remember. I am sure parents will view it more than one time, in their child's different developmental stages.

I really liked how Monta addressed the different ages, and even (!!!) siblings. Especially, I liked that Monta included how toddlers sometimes drop signs and what to do. It is so important for parents. This is the moment when most parents are discouraged to continue. Thank you Monta!

This DVD is a great asset to the baby signing world. It  is in my recommendation list to every parent with Monta's books and cards. Thank you for always being the pioneer with your resources!!!

Let the Sign Shine!

3690743,5,B001LQCIA2,"This has to be the best tool for teaching your baby (and yourself) sign language!

I've done sign language with both of my children. We've done classes and used books to try to learn new words but sometimes it's a challenge to figure out the movements of the signs from a still photo or drawing.

Books on the subject are still wonderful tools, but don't pass up on this DVD. There are over 300 signs shown in video and it could not be any easier. The signs are also perfect for ""talking"" with little ones.

The communication you will develop from this DVD is priceless. I love it, and will be giving it as a gift at baby showers.",1246233600,5,630,4.277310924369748
3690744,5,B001LQCIA2,"This DVD is great! It is more of an instructional dvd for parents, not exactly a DVD that is meant to hold baby's attention.  This DVD shows several families with signing babies.  It explains why signing is helpful with babies and also how to get started.  It has a great library of TONS of signs of different words that our little one LOVES to watch! This would be a GREAT DVD for anyone who wants to sign with their baby but just doesn't know where to start.",1246233600,2,460,4.264367816091954

8319465,5,B001LQCIA2,"This book is terrific. Mom's, Dad's,Babies and Friends not only enjoy and understand what baby is trying to say, but  heightens sign language to a new level as kids can teach other kids as well.",1301702400,,194,4.542857142857143
8319466,2,B001LQCIA2,The video teaches with a very basic method of one person signing at least 5 signs for each letter of the alphabet. This video teaches the parents the signs and then its up to the parent to teach their toddler.  This is not toddler friendly.,1294876800,,240,4.333333333333333
8319467,5,B001LQCIA2,"This turned out to be a wonderful DVD for my husband and I to learn a few signs to teach our new baby.  The best part is the index of signs so you can go directly to the demonstration of a particular sign you want to learn, and there are hundreds of words in the index.  We are really looking forward to teaching our baby!",1289088000,3,322,3.9384615384615387

However it has been very helpful with teaching my grandson to sign.",1271894400,,148,3.966666666666667
8319470,1,B001LQCIA2,This dvd is great to teach parents sign language but I thought it would help teach baby sing language. It does have a ton of words you can learn but the video doesn't help your baby learn just by watching.,1256342400,,205,4.15
8319471,5,B001LQCIA2,"This DVD is the perfect addition to the Baby Sign Language Basics family of ASL resources.  It's like taking one of Monta's workshops AND having babies signing on cue to show this stuff really works!!!  I especially love all the local talent.  Great work, Monta!",1252022400,,262,4.777777777777778
