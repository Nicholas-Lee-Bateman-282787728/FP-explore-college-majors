688311,5,630358909X,"Distirbing movie about a horserace and how cruel and abusive some of the characters are or become. I saw this movie when I was 11 years old and have never forgotten it. Anyone who loves animals and horses will be deeply moved. The movie encompasses all the human vices with the sheer unconditional loyality of the horses that they harm or kill. The ""desert scene"" of the horse running to it's death still haunts me. I hate westerns and loved this movie. Unconfortable to watch for animal lovers but worth it.",980380800,3,508,4.593406593406593
688312,4,630358909X,"If nothing else, this movie has a great cast and a very interesting storyline.  It begins in the first few years of the 20th century somewhere in the West.  A 700 mile race is promoted by a newspaper that sets rider  and horse against each other and the elements.  It also pits the wealthy  and their resources against those of more modest means with obvious  results.  However, I feel the strengh of ""Bite the Bullet"" is  not so much a story of classes as it is the characters themselves.  With a  plethora of well-known character actors, the movie takes the time to  develop each of these characters in a manner that makes ""Bite the  Bullet"" an enjoyable and very watchable movie.  Obviously, as a  person who loves the wide-screen version of any movie, I cannot wait for  ""Bite the Bullet"" to come out in DVD and widescreen format.  However, until that time, I feel that once you see the cast involved in  ""Bite the Bullet"" you will enjoy watching this wonderful and  underrated version an era coming to an end.",944092800,13,1014,4.538888888888889

688569,4,630358909X,"I'm not a huge fan of westerns, although I've enjoyed some of them a great deal. I first saw ""Bite the Bullet"" at the Paramount Theatre in Denver, CO, in the summer of 1975. When I learned that the movie was available on disc, I wanted to see if I still liked it as much as I did then. The story is about a horse race taking place in 1906 across much of what was then very wild territory. The old West is slowly fading away, and modern developments are changing the way things are done. While automobiles existed in 1906, and a handful had by then even made the trip from one coast to the other (starting in 1903, with a Winton), none are to be found in this film. At that time, automobiles were mostly toys which belonged to the wealthy, and weren't yet used as day-to-day transportation by the masses, especially in the remote West. The only internal combustion device in the film is a motorcycle, piloted by a reporter who is covering the race. It's painted to resemble an early Harley-Davidson, but is in fact a Montesa of the early 1970's, with modifications of make it look like an antique. The story revolves around the different characters entered in the race, their reasons for wanting to win, and how they relate to one another (not always smoothly). After watching the film for only the second time, I found that it has held up well, and I still enjoyed it.",1431388800,5,1368,4.41106719367589
688570,5,630358909X,This is a great family movie.  All the struggles getting to the finish line and the values being taught make for a great movie.  Can't wait until it comes out on Blueray.  One that's affordable.,1430438400,,194,4.485714285714286
688571,5,630358909X,"Background: The 1970's, as many veteran viewers know, marked a period of reworking many longtime dubious Hollywood western conventions. Authenticity, or what seemed more plausibly authentic, was in. And this new spin had its advantages; old westerners probably were often crude, rough, unschooled and unhygienic men, outnumbering women on the plains by more than 20 to 1. But one thing they also undoubtedly often were was cooperative. Nobody in an inhospitable habitat featuring brutal winters, deserts, roving bears, snakes and wildcats etc. surmounts all challenges alone; people helped one another because inevitably they would be needing an assist themselves. And ""Bite The Bullet"" brings this spirit across very well. It's certainly one of the more pleasant aspects of the era to contemplate, and one of the more charming features of this 1975 film too.

Plot: A western newspaper sponsors a grueling 700 mile cross country horse race for a winner-take-all $2000 prize in 1908. Sam Clayton/Gene Hackman, Luke Matthews/James Coburn and Mister/Ben Johnson play the seasoned old cowboy hands, Carbo/Jan-Michael Vincent and mysterious Miss Jones/Candice Bergen represent the younger generation, and English sportsman Sir Harry Norfolk/Ian Bannen and Mexican/Mario Arteaga add an international 'all-comers' presence. Sam and Luke are solid friends from their mutual days in the U.S. cavalry during the Spanish-American war. They ride very well, but as it turns out, so does most everyone else.

Assessment: How many filmgoers would normally care about such a race except a few equestrian fans? Director Richard Brooks realized that to maintain audience interest, he had to mold fully developed characters of the competitors. So before the race even starts, he devotes over 30 minutes screen time to begin the getting acquainted process when the riders converge to register. And then after the race proceeds across those vast open unforgiving western spaces, you get to know the entrants under pressure just as they do each other. And by the time the race and the movie come to a simultaneous close, you've come to like and care about most if not all. Plot's important, sure, but engaging characters such as these will get you there as well.

Credit much of that success with the characters here to uniformly excellent acting. Like everyone else, I expected much from old pros Hackman, Coburn and Johnson going in, but Jan-Michael was a surprise. While I haven't seen all of his films, this was easily the best of those I have. Basically, he grows up during the course of the race, going from a brash, foul-mouthed punk to a more mellow and considerate adult. Dramatically he matches Hackman and Johnson, who offers a memorable deathbed soliloquy on the life of a cowboy. Soundtrack music--which plays nearly nonstop except for an effective mute slo-mo climax--won an Oscar. Photography is almost as good. You may not favor the slow start here but hang on, it just keeps getting better. A winner in any field of westerns.",1429401600,,3021,5.19917864476386

688608,1,630358909X,"Westerns are my favorite genre, yet, this movie was a huge disappointment.

The casting was marvelous, but the material given to the actors was substandard, and the direction is weak and confusing.

The plot is about a marathon horse race in the early 1900's.  There are about 8 racers, but the movie seems so rushed and underdeveloped, that as the race starts, the viewer is not sure who is who.  During the race, one does not know who is doing what.  It is senseless and confusing.

Gene Hackman and James Colburn give valiant performances, but the direction and script are so thin, that even these two actors flounder.  Candice Bergen is one of the horse racers, and after riding 8 hours through dust and weather, her hair is shining, clean, and perfect, as are her clothes.  How's that for realism?  Jan Michael Vincent, a usual trusty actor, gives a schizophrenic performance not worthy of his talents.

This movie is NOT a 4-star movie as the review average shows.  My advice is to save your money.  My copy is going as a donation to the local library, as I have absolutely no desire to view this disappointing film again.  Kone",1416700800,,1134,4.63819095477387

It is a superb cast with James Coburn, Candice Bergen, Ben Johnson, Jan Michael Vincent, Dabney Coleman, Ian Bannen, Sally Kirkland and more.  Excellent music -- It was nominated for two oscars - best music and best sound.  The plot centers around a 700 mile endurance race in the west in the early 1900's.  The characters are well defined and laid out for you.  Two good friends and former Rough Riders, a British sportsman, a cocky young cowboy looking for trouble, a worn out civil war cowboy who would like to be called a winner because no one remembers a loser, a poor Mexican farmer with a bad toothache wishing for a better life for him and his family, the favorite a champion horse with a champion rider and others.

688743,5,630358909X,"As westerns began their long ride into the sunset, there were still talented film directors making a series of solid classics including director Richard Brooks (""The Professionals"", ""In Cold Blood""). ""Bite the Bullet"" manages to be both an unconventional western and be everything that the western as a genre is truly about; Brooks' film chronicles a 700 mile race for 2000 dollars with participants ranging from a young ""cowboy"" (Jan Michael-Vincent) to a hooker (Candice Bergen). The center of the film, though, is the rivalry and friendship between Sam Clayton (Gene Hackman) and Luke Matthews (James Coburn) who served in Cuba together under Roosevelt's command. Clayton ends up participating when he is fired by his employer by delivering one of the horses late to the competition while Matthews NEEDS to win simply for the money. Their competitors are rounded by Sir Harry Norfolk (Ian Bannen) and a former Civil War vet (Ben Johnson) who also have their own reasons for wanting to win--sometimes at any cost.

Brooks does a terrific job with the film keeping the action rolling but not at the expense of character development. Hackman gives an outstanding performance (in fact the entire cast is top notch throughout) as a jaded former soldier who exhibits unusual kindness and empathy for his competitors.

Some folks will dislike the ending which leaves some key relationships unresolved but I personally think it works in favor of the film. The reason the film probably flopped at the box office was an indifferent publicity campagin and the misforture of opening the same day as ""Jaws"" which ate ALL the competition alive in those first few weeks of June 1975.

Brooks sets up one brilliant sequence  (pre CGI mind you) where Coburn's character rides faster than Vincent's in the desert with the former moving at normal speed while the latter is photographed in slow motion (if you look really carefully you can see it's a double exposure cleverly set up for this sequence) that perfectly captures the emotions and frustration of the moment visually.

This cult classic arrives in a handsome and nearly flawless prsentation from Twilight Time on Blu-ray. Colors are bold and the images are sharp with the exception of one scene (where I suspect it was a deliberate choice).

The audio is present in its original mono incarnation with dialoge clear and subtitles in English available only.

The special features are limited which is a pity because, I'm sure hiding somewhere in the Columbia vaults, there is a vintage TV promotional featurette and this film deserves a full commentary.

We get Alex North's marvelous score isolated on a separate track. We also get a brief but good essay from Julie Kirgo on the making of the film and its themes. There is a reproduction of the original one sheet poster on the last page of the booklet. The last special feature here is the original theatrical trailer.

Although priced a bit high at many places, the Blu-ray was still available as of the date of this review in a limited edition of 3000 copies from Twilight Time (via Screen Archives Entertainment).

Gene Hackman, James Coburn, Candice Bergen (in a subplot that doesn't provide much of a payoff), Ian Bannen, Ben Johnson, and Jan-Michael Vincent are contestants in a turn-of-the-century, 700-mile cross-country race that takes its toll on both participants and their horses. The plot is familiar, but the performances and Brooks' direction make the material fresh, aided considerably by scenic locales and an outstanding Alex North score.

While ""Bite the Bullet"" is humorous and entertaining throughout, the film also feels like a sometimes-uneasy mix of old-fashioned filmmaking with `70s ""realism"": the graphic scenes of horses breaking down are powerful, and give the film an edge that earlier Saturday matinee-type fare lacked (it's a credit to Brooks that the horses in the film were, according to him, not injured by the stunts shown in the picture).

As long as you're prepared for the occasional disparity in tone, the picture is just marvelous, featuring a rousing (and satisfying) ending, great southwestern locations, and appealing performances by a game cast. From one of Hackman's best roles to North's scoring, ""Bite the Bullet"" is a Blu-Ray must for western aficionados.

Another phenomenal presentation from Sony's Columbia vaults, ""Bite the Bullet"" looks dazzling on Blu-Ray: the DNR-free, 1080p AVC encoded transfer offers fine details, lush colors and exceptional clarity. Even better, the film's original mono recording has been brilliantly remixed to a 5.1 DTS MA soundtrack that enhances every aspect of North's score far beyond the limited parameters of its original audio. The trailer, Kirgo's booklet notes, and an isolated score track, assembled as always by the great Mike Matessino, put a cap on one of the year's best BD catalog titles to date.",1336953600,5,2064,5.440625

Was delighted to see the high resolution and wide screen format. But it all went sour right at the very end of the movie. To avoid a spoiler, let me say that the race is not won by the rider whom I remember winning in the other versions I've witnessed. Instead of showing this rider crossing the finish line on his horse, there is a sudden blackout as we see two of the near-winners walking their horses up to just short of the finish line. Then suddenly the screen goes black. No ""The End"" or cast of characters. Nothing. Just a blackout. I called Screen Archives Entertainment, and a knowledgeable spokesman indicated he didn't know why the ending had been changed--if indeed it had.
  If any of you know what I'm talking about here, I think you'll agree that this lopped off finish to the story significantly changes its meaning, since the lop-off wipes out a beautiful irony that makes for a perfect ending to the film. What a disappointment!
  Now, on the chance that my memory has failed me, I would appreciate a comment or two from some of you who have seen this movie in either a theatrical showing or on the DVD (with the pan-and-scan image). If I'm right, I'll probably return the disk. If I'm wrong, I'll be happy to keep it. Note: the blackout could be a fault in the disk. But I need to know that I'm remembering the story rightly before I can be sure about a fault. So, am I right or wrong? Who won the doggone race? Thanks so much for you help in this.  SBlack

As of today May 29, I have been able to consult an expert on Western movies. He says that I am correct and that the Blu ray of BTB has indeed lopped off the original ending, thus not giving us the true winner of the horse race. He cited the Blu ray of Soylent Green as another example of a botched transfer, the last seven minutes of the film being cut off. Sorry about my experience, since the Blu ray of BTB is beautiful up to the aborted ending. By the way, I know this is not Amazon's or Screen Archives' fault.

688801,4,630358909X,"I know because I own one.  As a multitude of reviews here testify, 'Bite the Bullet' (4 stars) is a real gem of a western-adventure that got buried under a heap of equally well-made but more topical genre films released in 1975 ('Jaws,' 'Cuckoo's Nest,' 'Shampoo,' 'Nashville,' 'Dog Day Afternoon,' etc.).  It is a fact, however, that Columbia released two versions of BTB on DVD:  one a picture disc containing only the ugly pan/scan fullscreen transfer of the film and the other a flipper which features that and a nice 2.35:1 widescreen transfer.  Problem is that information appears in small print on the back of the packaging (I believe the UPC codes are even the same), which you won't be able to confirm unless you have the thing in your hand.  So you have to either 1) comb your local DVD outlets to see if you can luck into one, or 2) query the vendor before you purchase online.  (You can also opt for the Blu-ray or pick up the 'Quick and the Dead/Bite the Bullet' double feature, which offers BTB in widescreen.)

688803,4,630358909X,"BITE THE BULLET is a thinking man's western, atypical of your run-of-the-mill oater. Its main protagonist is Gene Hackman whose role of an iconoclastic saddle tramp subverts one aspect of the alpha male frontiersman. Sam Clayton (Hackman) is rugged enough and can handle himself in any situation - he used to be one of Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders. Sam Clayton champions horses and fairmindedness and is unfailingly kind to those in distress. And there's a sense that he doesn't much care whether he comes in first. This makes him a rather blas competitor in the grueling 700-mile cross-country horse race which rewards the winner with $2000, or as Clayton himself describes it: a ""gut-twistin', back-bustin', man-killin' goddamn race.""

There's a whiff of an elegiac tone wafting about. The story is set in 1906, a time when the Old West had just about run its course and modern civilization is rapidly encroaching, its railroads making deep inroads into the vastness of the once untamed badlands. With regards to this endurance race, representation of this advancement comes in the shape of a reporter navigating the harsh terrain on his primitive motorcycle.

The film takes its time arriving at the actual race. First, we take in the main participants: Sam Clayton; the sometime prostitute Miss Jones (Candice Bergen); Clayton's best friend Luke Matthews (James coburn) who's gambling his entire stake on winning the race; a cruel young cowboy out to make a name for himself (Jan-Michael Vincent); an old cowpuncher with a bad pump who's in it for pride (Ben Johnson); an impoverished Mexican with a killer tooth ache (Mario Arteaga); and a sporting Englishman (Ian Bannen). The rules given are that each participant must carry at least 160 pounds and must make every check point. During the race and at these check points, these characters find themselves interacting which in turn creates dramatic conflict. Some become friends, some adversaries. And a surprising number come to the aid of their fellow racers. This story is infused with a strong spirit of sportsmanship, and perhaps no scene embodies the film's humanity more than the final one, in which we learn who ends up winning the race. The striking thing is, it's not about who wins it, but rather how it's won.

The story unfolds in episodic fashion, and that may turn off some viewers. But there's something to Gene Hackman's performance. It may seem unbelievable in this skeptical age that his character could be so charitable so often, and this to his competitors. But Hackman, world-weary and soulful, makes it believable. The cinematography lends grandeur to the various terrains navigated by the racers, although these evocative vistas are compromised by this DVD's full screen presentation. There's also a wicked twist late in the film which I absolutely did not see coming.

Note that there are several scenes which depict abuse being done to horses, although not one horse was harmed in the shooting of the film. Still, I'd like to drive a spur into Jan-Michael Vincent's young punk character.",1310860800,6,3070,5.073267326732673

Who will be the last man/horse standing?

That's the basic theme in ""Bite the Bullet"", a 1975 Western written and directed by Richard Brooks.

Along the way they will be attacked by a Bear, a rattlesnake, outlaws, convicts, and the elements, from the cold to the blazing heat, from rivers to mountains and the desert.

One by one they will fall. One will wear himself out and another will wear out his horse. One will get shot and another will have to shot his horse. As the race progresses, the numbers narrow. Who will prevail?

Gene Hackman (1930 - ) is the animal friendly former Rough Rider. Hackman is a two time Oscar winner (""Unforgiven"" and ""The French Connection"") and earned 3 more nominations (""Mississippi Burning"", ""I Never Sang for my Father"", ""Bonnie and Clyde""). A veteran of nearly 100 films in a career that started in 1961, Hackman has been in several westerns (""The Quick and the Dead"", ""Wyatt Earp"", ""Unforgiven"", ""The Hunting Party"") but personally I liked him best as the blind man in ""Young Frankenstein"" (1974).

James Coburn (1928-2002) is another master of the western yarn, whether he's playing Pat Garrett (""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid""), dynamite throwing Irish rebel John Mallory (""Duck You Sucker""), soldier Potts (""Major Dundee""), or  the knife wielding Britt from ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960). He does his usual fine job.

The true star of the film, apart from the horses, in Ben Johnson (1918-96) who plays the aging cowboy. Johnson was the consummate cowboy. He appeared in nearly 100 films, mostly westerns. In addition to his 9 films with John Ford, Johnson appeared in such classics as ""Shane"" (1953), ""Hang `em High"" (1968), ""Dillinger"" (1973), and ""Bite the Bullet"" (1975). He was a favorite of Sam Peckinpah who used him in ""Major Dundee"" (1965), ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), ""Junior Bonner"" (1972), and ""The Getaway"" (1972). He won the Oscar and a Golden Globe in 1972 for ""The Last Picture Show"" and a Western Heritage award for this film. Johnson has a scene in which he talks about his life, and this is as good a scene as any actor has ever played in any film.

Richard Brooks (1912-92) directs.  He won an Oscar for ""Elmer Gantry"" (1960) and earned 4 more nominations (""Blackboard Jungle"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""The Professionals"", ""In Cold Blood""). For his work on this film he won the Western Heritage award. It's interesting that writer/director Brooks has Hackman respond to an inquiry by one of the prostitutes as to how he would like it with this line - ""With as little conversation as possible."" Brooks was known as a very wordy writer and his films are far chattier than most films, especially his westerns (""Men of Texas"", ""The Last Hunt"", and ""The Professionals"").

The top grossing films in 1975 were ""Jaws"", ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"", and ""Shampoo""  The big Oscar winner was ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (Picture, Director. Actor, Actress, Screenplay). Other notable films that year were ""Nashville"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Barry Lyndon"" ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", and ""Seven Beauties"". It wasn't a strong year for westerns - ""Breakheart Pass"", ""Posse"" ""Rooster Cogburn"".

688869,5,630358909X,"Long-distance ""endurance"" horse races were popular in the later years of the Old West, and this movie chronicles one of them, held during the presidency of Teddy Roosevelt and sponsored by the (fictitious) Western Chronicle.  Two magnates (Dabney Coleman, John McLiam) have called the race as a means of finding out whether native mustangs or pedigreed highbreds are better suited to long-distance work, and a motley crew of riders shows up to compete for the five-digit cash prize by covering 700 miles of rough terrain--from desert to mountain--in a week's time.  There's Luke Matthews (James Coburn), a gambler, and his old friend Sam Clayton (Gene Hackman), both veterans of Roosevelt's Rough Riders; an aged cowboy (Ben Johnson) who's knocked around the West for nearly 50 years and finds himself with nothing to show for it; a quick-tempered, arrogant young wannabe (Jan-Michael Vincent); a small-scale Mexican ranchero (Mario Arteaga); a British sportsman (Ian Bannen) with a Thoroughbred; a hired rider (Robert Hoy) on one of the magnates' Arabian; and a young woman (Candace Bergen) who's hoping the prize money will help her and her husband (currently serving time for bank robbery) get a new start when he's released.  As they struggle over the course men and horses will die and character will be tested and secrets come to light.

688870,4,630358909X,"Westerns were falling out of favor as a genre when this movie came out in 1975. At the same time, the U.S. was preparing to mark its bicentennial. According to the new book ""Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks"" (available from amazon.com), writer-director Brooks wanted to make a movie that looked back at what had made America great. That was quite different from so many movies of the period, which took aim at what was going wrong in the country.

Brooks had made only two other westerns in his career as a screenwriter and director, but he had managed to make an impression with both. ""The Last Hunt"" focused on how buffalo fell victim to racism against the American Indian, and ""The Professionals"" was a solid action movie anchored by a great script and solid direction.

For ""Bite the Bullet"" he wrote an original script (those other two westerns had been based on novels) about a 700-mile horse race, the kind of endurance race popular at the turn of the 20th century. Along with Gene Hackman and James Coburn he cast western veteran Ben Johnson for the movie's most poignant character.

Some people consider this movie a bore. I have yet to talk to a western fan who didn't like it, particularly for its cinematography. Its music got an Oscar nomination for Alex North. If you can, watch the widescreen version instead of the pan-and-scan format.

688871,5,630358909X,"Somewhere along the way, Richard Brooks' brilliant 1975 ode to the dying west ""Bite the Bullet"" fell through the cracks.

It's not like any western I've ever seen, and yet it's an extraordinarily robust celebration of the glorious myths of our American landscape.

Partially based on a true story, ""Bite the Bullet"" details an early 20th century horse race, a marathon of endurance through the mountains, desert and snow of Colorado and Nevada. A motley crew of archetypes sign up to participate for the cash prize, including two former Rough Riders, a British adventurer, a quiet Mexican, an elder cowboy and even a blonde beauty in chaps who looks suspiciously like Candice Bergen. There's plenty of gambling on the favorites, a traveling brothel and endless bottles of whiskey. A top thoroughbred is bankrolled by an arrogant millionaire and appears to be the favorite, but as the race stumbles along, it becomes clear more than natural speed will be needed to cross the finish line.

Brooks, one of the greatest of Hollywood directors, had memorably tread the western landscape before with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Hunt-VHS/dp/6303072577/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Hunt [VHS</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Professionals-Special-Edition/dp/B0007MAO0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Professionals (Special Edition)</a>, and ""Bite the Bullet"" was his assured swan song to the storied genre. The casting of Gene Hackman and James Coburn as the Rough Riders (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rough-Riders-Dover-Books-on-Americana/dp/0486450996/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rough Riders (Dover Books on Americana)</a>) was a brilliant move. Hackman especially, is perfect in a largely passive role originally intended for Charles Bronson. There's a weariness and cynicism about his character, and he's a deeply tortured soul. When he finally reveals the pain of his life during a revisionist scene at a water pit stop, his rage echoes across the desert plains. It's an astonishing moment, and you realize you are watching not only one of the great actors of his generation, but one of the finest scenes in all of movie history. Coburn is silky perfect as the extrovert, all teeth and lanky limbs, winking at hardship while attempting a shortcut, usually ending up in the drink. There's not a false note in the unusually stellar cast, including Ben Johnson, Dabney Coleman, Ian Bannen, Jan-Michael Vincent and Jean Willes, all leaving memorable impressions as characters that could easily have been one dimensional. Their dialog is key, and Brooks' terrific screenplay gives the cast much to chew on.

The beauty of ""Bite the Bullet"" is you're never sure who's going to win the race. There's plenty of sidetracks, an ambush, a few comedic moments on a newfangled motorcycle and even a heart attack of an important cast member. Through it all, just when you think you know the outcome, the surprise conclusion sneaks up on you with gentle reserve. Only a director with Brooks' accomplished experience, honed over many years, could have balanced so many themes simultaneously, jumping from comedy to tragedy within a single scene. The Academy took notice, though not enough, nominating the film for Best Musical Score and Best Sound. But ""Bite the Bullet"" is a work of grace, passion and stunning skill. It is one of the most unheralded films of the 1970s, and one of the greatest westerns ever made.",1268697600,2,4251,6.238500851788756
688872,4,630358909X,"In the 1970s when westerns were typically cynical, dark and violent, Bite the Bullet went for a more traditional movie, and it works because when it comes right down to it, it's a good story.  In the early 1900s, saddle tramp Sam Clayton is out of work after delivering a horse to the start point of a 700-mile horse race.  At first, Clayton wants none of the race, but comes around and ends up joining the competition.  One of nine riders, Clayton sets off through hellish terrain with little water.  Can the riders tread that fine line between pushing both themselves and their mounts too far, and who will win?  Not much action here, but I never found myself bored.  Great location shooting, a good score by Alex North, and a strong ensemble cast make this 70s western an enjoyable one.

  At the height of his popularity, Gene Hackman leads the ensemble cast as Sam Clayton, the cowboy looking for work who joins the 700-mile race.  Clayton wants to win, but not at a cost of his own beliefs and morals.  If someone's in trouble, he'll help.  Candice Bergen stars as Miss Jones, a former prostitute who joins the race to earn some much-needed money, but there may be more going on than she tells.  James Coburn plays Luke Matthews, Clayton's old friend who has bet every cent he has on the most reliable rider...himself.  Hackman's scenes with Coburn make their past friendship more realistic and believable, you like both characters.  Ben Johnson is great in a small part as Mister, an ex-Pony Express rider who's tried everything in life but believes he won't be remembered, winning the race on the other hand would immortalize him.  Some of the other riders include Ian Bannen as Sir Harry Norfolk, a British sportsmen who loves competition, Jean-Michael Vincent as Carbo, a youngster trying to prove himself, Mario Arteaga as the Mexican, and Robert Hoy as Christie, the early favorite.

 The DVD seems like it was just thrown together.  No special features, not even a trailer, and a fullscreen presentation of a movie that would look great in widescreen.

""Bite the Bullet"" is an all-star Western about a 700-mile horse race that takes place in the middle of 'Nowhere, USA' at the turn of the last century, for a chance to win the grand prize of $2000...

At the head of the line is Gene Hackman, an ex-Rough Rider who believes in caring for lame animals, and despises cruelty to horses, ladies in distress, lost kids and lost causes...Hackman has got the heart, and at the film's climax, he is the sleeper--the one to beat...

His old-timer friend from fighting days at San Juan Hill is James Coburn, a natural-born gambler who certainly can't afford to lose... He just bet everything on this race, and got seven-to-one... Coburn and Hackman have a great chemistry together, and their friendly rivalry imposes the name of the game...

Also riding: Candice Bergen, who has 'two thousand reasons' to compete in the race; Ben Johnson who desperately wants to win the prize to be a man to remember; Ian Bannen, the tough Englishman who comes 5,000 miles to beat the best; Mario Arteaga, the cool Mexican who needs the money for his loving family in spite of suffering from unbearable toothache; and Jan Michael-Vincent who brings the lower calibrations of judgment, antagonism, and rage to his interactions... This punk kid certainly has a knack of provoking a man to violence... He soon will be in his own best way to learn some life lessons from 'real' cowboys...

Hackman plays the part of an aging cowboy that appreciates horses. Coburn a worthy rival that isn't above dirty tricks. Johnson an elderly rival that deserves respect.

688939,3,630358909X,"Bite the Bullet has a solid screenplay and is an often handsome looking picture, but it boasts some of the worst editing I've ever seen in a major studio picture. At times it's so disjointed it's almost as if you're watching an assembly put together before shooting has finished. Certainly the potential of many scenes seems to thrown away in slapdash editing that constantly undermines the film. Considering the troubles other Columbia pictures had at the time in their desperate attempts to avoid bankruptcy, it's possible that the film was cut to the bone from a much longer version, but it looks like they've thrown out the baby with the bathwater.

As a result, Richard Brooks' tale of a western endurance horse race never really connects despite a great cast - Gene Hackman on top form and James Coburn in roles that seem to be virtual reprises of Robert Ryan and Burt Lancaster's characters in The Professionals, and Ben Johnson as a nameless saddle tramp out to make a name for himself before he dies best among them. There's also the problem of animal cruelty: despite the script's compassion for horses, there's no doubting that some of the horsefalls would now be illegal. On the plus side, there's some truly striking use of slow motion and normal speed in the same frame, and when the film isn't in such an all-fired hurry it does throw in some nice character moments. And it's a lot better than Hidalgo.

While Columbia's DVD has a decent 2.35:1 transfer (although some copies offer only a crummy panned-and-scanned version), it's worth seeking out Twilight Time's limited edition region-free US Blu-ray release, which has absolutely astonishing picture quality - it's like watching a completely different film compared to the old DVD, and the level of detail really transforms parts of the film. The original trailer, an isolated track for Alex North's Oscar-nominated score and an informative booklet round out the Blu-ray's extras.",1142985600,2,1948,4.97239263803681

688941,4,630358909X,"Somehow I managed to avoid this movie when it hit the theaters in 1975; my mistake.  However, I was not into westerns in 1975, and only recently did I give this movie the chance it deserved.  This movie is more than a mundane western with rehashed themes.  There are traditional western themes in this movie, but the movie has much more to offer to a viewer.

We meet Sam Clayton (Gene Hackman) early in this movie.  Gene is kind to animals, children and women; especially animals.  I wondered why Sam was involved in a horse race given his love of animals.  However, Sam's concern for animals is an important part of the story.  As the movie evolves we learn that a newspaper has sponsored a 700 mile horse race.  We meet the principals in a way that allows us to gain an initial impression of each person's character.  Candice Bergen is Miss Jones, a lady with a sordid past.  James Coburn is taciturn cowboy Luke Matthews, who apparently had an interesting past that involved Sam Clayton.  Jan Michael Vincent is the brash young upstart Carbo who learns that Sam will tolerate no mistreatment of animals.  Ben Johnson is a former Pony Express rider.

Any movie about a horse race must have a hook, and this movie has several subplots, which I leave you to discover for yourself.  The movie also has at least a couple of themes.  The less subtle theme is the changes that the West and the United States were going through.  We see aspects of those changes that were slowly making gunslingers and cowboys things of the past.  We also see a variety of social conditions that would lead to societal upheavals well into the latter half of the last century.  While some reviewers may laugh at the poignancy of this movie and the changing way of life, perhaps those same reviewers will feel differently in several more decades.

The only theme that was a bit too subtle was the treatment of horses and other animals.  Cowboys have always had the greatest respect for their horses, as Sam did for his.  Conversely, the non-cowboy riders mistreated their horses terribly.  I think the point in this was that people who rely on animals as part of a team treat them with respect.  People who see animals as a tool or a means to an end may use or abuse them in a way that we identify as cruel.  Perhaps the director was also trying to equate cruelty to animals with modern life.  In any case, Sam Clayton was there for the horses!

""Bite the Bullet"" is a complicated movie with a lot of character development.  Some of the development is stereotypical to move the story along, but the lead actors get a good chance to define themselves.  The story moves along very quickly, with steady pacing from beginning to end.  The result is a classic action-adventure western that deserves a bowl of popcorn and a couple of hours of your time.",1133395200,6,2824,4.556660039761431
688942,5,630358909X,"Perhaps only Richard Brooks with his tough-minded humanism could have written and directed a movie as open-hearted as this one. All of the major characters appear at first as archetypes (Gene Hackman the rough-hewn loner, Jan-Michael Vincent the cruel and callow young pup begging for his come-uppance etc.) but as the movie rolls on Brooks presents each in deeply human terms. ""Bite the Bullet"" is a kennly perceptive -- and redemptive -- group character study masquerading as robust adventure. I don't mean the big action sequences are a shill; they're beauitifully filmed and exciting as hell. But they take second position to the warm, forgiving quality of Brooks' storytelling. Unfairly overlooked on its original release, this is a movie (like ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" by a very different sort of writer-director) whose contemplative and profoundly humane textures glow with greater luminescence as the years go by. Sterling character work by the entire cast, especially the underrrated James Coburn and the heartbreakingly stolid Ian Bannen. As an added treat, there's a great, evocative score by the late Alex North. And if the finale doesn't move you to tears you may be beyond reaching.",1132704000,10,1209,5.237113402061856

The characters are wonderfully drawn, though tending toward types (Gene Hackman, the good-guy animal lover; Candice Bergman, the bad girl turned good; Ben Johnson, the tough old coot; etc.; think STAGECOACH). They compete against each other, but at the same time grow to respect each other; they are all honorable and winners. Hackman is especially good as the good Samaritan in the lead. Best of all about the movie might be the photography, which is stunningly beautiful, though the slow-motion camera work (a fad of the times that thankfully has disappeared) is overdone.

The trio of Ash, Brock, and Misty is now a quartet: Ash, Brock, and brother and sister Mai and Max.  Mai is cute, but does not like to study or use other words besides ""awesome.""

Episode 23 (Season 6) - A Bite to Remember - On the journey to Rustboro City and the gym there, Max tries to force a cute little Poochyena to evolve.  I don't think he should force it. It is cute as it is, and look how long Ash has had Pikachu, and it has not evolved into Raichu.  Team Rocket plays on Max's concerns with an ""evolution machine"" that has Meowth dressing up in different Pokemon costumes.  Funny!

Episode 24  - The Lotad Lowdown - Brock befriends a cute little Lotad, a water-lily type Pokemon.  The gang finds a Pokemon preserve managed by two sisters.  The little sister develops a crush on Brock, while Brock pines over the older one.

Episode 25 - All things Bright and Beautifly - At last, Mai has found her calling.  She meets two friends who participate in Pokemon ""contests.""  The contests are not battles; attacks are judged on beauty, skill, and poise of trainer and Pokemon.  May falls in love with the pretty ribbons winners get.  This episode is absolutely hilarious because Jessie enters the contest completly unprepared, putting her Sviper in a nervous sweat.  I was laughing my head off.

Episode 26 - All in a Day's Wurmple - The stunningly beautiful Beautifly evolves from a caterpillar-type Wurmpole.  Mai and Jessie both race into the forest after the same Pokemon.

Episode 27 (Gonna Rule the School) - Finally arriving in Rustboro City, Ash is dismayed by being delayed at going to the gym, as Mai and Max are very taken with a Pokemon Academy that teaches kids all about Pokemon.  The school has a vault of Pokeballs containing Pokemen each wearing the school emblem, and who will obey any trainer.  Team Rocket is delighted at the prospective haul.

689015,5,630358909X,"I watched this film the other night- I hadn't seen it since I was a teenager.  I loved it.

It's a western that's much more than that. While it's premise is about a horse race- it's really about life's race; about games that seem bought and paid for, age vs youth, friendships and whether we let things come between them, and about why people run the race and how one man's reaction to it can influence others to change the dynamic(in a good way).

Hackman and Coburn make a good combination in this as former Rough Riders. Jan Michael Vincent had a role where he really had to shine and I think he gave the performance of his career, here. Ben Johnson breaks your heart in what is one of the most real roles he has ever offered (and probably a real testament to how the real cowboy lived). Candice Bergman is terrific, too.

This story handles a full range of issues (racial, sexual and animal rights) in a fair and real sense. Some have remarked about some of the cruelty depicted here, and the point Richard Brooks was making (I think) is, there are some real swine in this world. They view anything- be it animal or their fellow human beings, merely as a means to an end. They're either too stupid or too insensitive to know how dark they are. It's also an example of how we set examples for one another. If you allow stupid to do as stupid does- stupid will!

I won't spoil the ending- let's just say that it makes a point about what's really important, in a very effective, emotion filled way. I think you leave this film not only satisfied- but feeling uplifted.

My personal favorite of Richard Brooks and time extrememly well spent.",1099785600,37,1641,4.417218543046357

689017,5,630358909X,"This terrific movie depicts a long distance horse race in an old west on the cusp of change. Advancing industries and machinery (sequence with Coburn and Hackman bouncing around in a motorbike and side-car reflects this perfectly, and is a hoot!) would soon render many aspects of frontier life out-moded. This movie covers great distances both geographically and in terms of the characters. Gene Hackman is tremendous and sits astride the narrative with a knock-out performance. His hard-bitten sweat-drenched horseman with a barb-wire soul is given extra depth by the fact that he is also a fighter for animal rights -a novel notion in that age. Coburn is Coburn; basso-profundo voice, grinning with all 95 of his teeth, he does all that is asked of him. Feisty Candice Bergen displays grit and guts to match the dudes and more than holds her own in a film with leaves you spent and involved. The look and flavour of the movie are rooted firmly in the 70's - a golden age of cinema - and the direction and set pieces involve you from the get-go. The sand, sweat and blood onscreen is palpable. And the struggles, deceptions and rivalries will bring out the true grit in any viewer.

And who knew Candice Bergen could sit a horse so well? This grueling endurance race, based very loosely on a true story, pits Thoroughbred against Mustang, Arabian against Quarter Horse. The riders are no less a mixed bag than their mounts. The savage terrain takes its toll on man and beast, creating enemies and reluctant allies. The brutality depicted in this race was not unknown at that time and one hopes that the Special Effects Department was responsible for bringing it to the screen. Making that optimistic assumption, I recommend the movie to action lovers and those who study human nature.

Cowboys of the west did not treat their horses as depicted in the movie. Horses were their life line.

I can't rightly remember. But whether this movie was controversial or not,there isn't a decent cowboy alive, then or now, that would treat their horses the way this movie portrayed. The scene where the horse goes over the cliff into the lake, is not fakery. Tie-wires are used to make the horses look lame, trip-wires to make them fall.
I bought this movie because I had seen it when I was a kid. When I grew up, I thought I'd like to see it again. I don't know if I was more ashamed of the cruelty to animals or ashamed because I was duped into buying and seeing this movie again.
There's nothing about the true west in this movie. No history, no facts, just fiction and not even good fiction at that. There's nothing majestic about a horse being ridden to death.
Well . . . now I've said my piece, I hope you use some sense and don't be duped into buying this movie again like I was.
