I was a young teen and I remember really identifying with Kath and having such a crush on Michael. I also remember picking up a few things that were not covered in sex ed! I think this movie should be re-released for teens...it is still relevant and it does a great job of being true, informative, entertaining and touching but without being overly provocative.",1374192000,2,546,4.525252525252525
8058836,5,B0009AHQX0,"I never had the good luck of finding this on video...I had to get it as a DVD from someone else. I really hope it is someday released on DVD.

Yes, it was made for TV, so it's not perfect. Yes, it was made in the 70s, so its not perfect. But that adds to the charm, I think. It really takes you back to the 70s, when the book was written, so it works really well.

I had read the book many times, and heard in passing that a movie had been made in the 70s, but being born in 1982, I never got the chance to watch it. Then I stumbled upon it.

I think it's great. Heart warming, you really feel for the characters. However, I will say that towards the end, it starts to not quite follow the way the book flows, while the rest is pretty true to form. Except for the fact that in the book we hear about Katherine's sister Jamie as a pretty important secondary character, and there is no mention of her in the movie at all :(. Other than that, it was great, and I love it and watch it over and over. I really wish it would be released on DVD so that more people would be able to enjoy it again.

I know this review isn't the best, but if you have read the book and get a chnce to watch the movie, DO IT! If you get a chance to watch the movie, read the book first. I highly recommend doing both, and in that order.",1281484800,3,1310,3.858736059479554
8058837,5,B0009AHQX0,"I have not seen this movie in a long time (since it was on TV in the 70s), but from what I remember, this movie epitomized the late 70s (bell bottoms, Fleetwood Mac, etc...) Would I say that this movie is 5-star because it had a top-notch plot and cast? No-both were just average. I gave it 5 stars for its nostalgia factor. I was (and still am) a big fan of Judy Blume, and I remember the novel ""Forever"" being 6th grade contraband in the catholic school that I attended. This was a racy novel! She had sex with her boyfriend! OMG! When the movie was released, all of us little tween girls plotted ways that we could watch the movie without our parents finding out. I remember sleeping over my grandparents' house, and watching it upstairs on the black and white TV. This is a good movie to watch to relive an innocent time before 9/11, smoking bans, HIV/AIDS and trans fats.",1167436800,5,876,4.347560975609756
8058838,5,B0009AHQX0,"This movie was made for TV in 1978. This is a very rare hard to find movie & was contraversal back then. Stars a young Stephanie Zimbalist & Dean Butler(Almonzo on Little House). Movie followed the best seller book by Judy Blume. Remember when everyone in junior high was passing around the book to read the ""good parts?""
This movie is awesome! Teenagers loosing their virginity. Quite a racy subject for a made for TV movie of the late 1970's! The budding love & first sexual experience of Kath & Michael. Shows Kath going to a clinic to get birth control, too. Great 1970's clothes, bell bottoms, waist length hair & music of Fleetwood Mac. Remember back then when ""Dreams"" was on the radio every 30 minutes? Remember when teenagers actually had a record collections & played records at parties?
The movie ending is somewhat disappointing but I suppose necessary. When you are 17 saying ""forever"" does not really mean
""forever"".
I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes 1970's nostalgia & wants to take a trip back through memory lane.",1155513600,12,1045,4.747252747252747
