1555942,4,B00005JPAM,"In Stephen Frears and Peter Morgan`s ""The Queen"", Helen Mirren gives a spot-on brilliant portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II during arguably the darkest days of her reign: those following the untimely death of Princess Diana.  Through this narrow door of one week's time the audience is provided a wide-angle view of the entirety of the 20th century Elizabethan era, from the effects of the abdication of Edward VIII, through ten prime ministers, to the 1997 arrival of Blair. This portal additionally allows us to see much of the character of PM Tony Blair (played magnificently by Michael Sheen) during the early days of his government.

Interspersed with genuine newsreel footage of Diana and the Paris crash, the bulk of the film takes place with the Queen in Balmoral and Blair in No. 10, as the rest of the world sits stunned and shocked at reports of the Alma tunnel crash. Sweeping and glorious panoramas of the Scottish highlands fade in to vistas of flowers piled outside Kensington. The Queen drives around in her Rover tending to her dogs as Blair is driven around London while dealing with the press.

With the Royal Family holed up in their country home in apparent dismissive denial (""Have you heard from the Spencers on what they wish to do with the funeral?""), and a national populace increasingly frustrated by their response, Blair deftly tries to maneuver the monarch into a more sympathetic attitude, all the while deferring to the megalith that is the institution of ER-II. The film shows the delicate interplay of prime minister and monarch, sparing us none of the cagey-ness, mutual respect, and suspicion. Marvelous parallels are drawn between the stalking of a stag on the Balmoral grounds and the stalking and death of the Princess of Wales.

Mirren's performance is Oscar worthy. At this writing she has already bagged the Best Actress award at Venice, and will no doubt carry a major sweep of all gilded statues.  She effects a beautiful balance of the stony matronly monarch and the vulnerable womanly mother and grandmother without once giving way to stereotype or parody. She adds great humor to the film with the slightest flicker of a smirk or icy glare. She employs the ever-present purse carried by Her Majesty (why? why?) to great effect.

The supporting cast is likewise magnificent and should garner their own share of honors. Syliva Sims is particularly engaging as the jaded, hunched, martini swilling dowager  queen mother. There are no punches pulled vis a vis the characters:Philip is boorish, Cherie Blair is irreverent, Charles is conflicted. Yet each is treated respectfully, and the overall portrayal is realistic and compassionate.

Wittily written, wonderfully filmed, and masterfully edited; this is well worth the viewing and will stand the test of time.",1161475200,5,2802,5.036717062634989
1555943,5,B00005JPAM,"F. Scott Fitzgerald famously wrote, ""Let me tell you about the rich. They are different from you and I."" For the House of Windsor, that difference is magnified a hundredfold. Trained fastidiously to be the living representatives of a thousand years of British history, cocooned from everyday life by their station and privilege, the members of the Royal Family adopted a becoming public dignity and reserve that served them well in the dark days of the London Blitz. Unfortunately, that reserve doesn't play so well in the democratized Britain of the Information Age, which makes them appear cold and unlikable while simultaneously blowing the cover off the times when they, shall we say, strain against the bonds of royal protocol.  Stephen Frears' ""The Queen"" masterfully depicts the event that finally brought home to the Royal Family the power of the media and the people--the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in the late summer of 1997. Remembering Diana as a selfish, neurotic troublemaker, Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren), Prince Philip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) have no conception of how beloved she was by the people, simply because she possessed the common touch the rest of them so conspicuously lack. Ensconced in luxurious isolation at Balmoral Castle, they maintain a starchy silence that new Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) recognizes immediately as a public relations catastrophe. Peter Morgan's superb screenplay details the frantic efforts of Blair to get the initially uncomprehending Elizabeth to reach out to her grieving subjects. While Philip and the Queen Mum pressure Elizabeth to stand her ground (Philip mocks the list of mourners at Diana's funeral as ""a chorus line of pop stars and homosexuals""), Blair's anti-monarchist wife Cherie (Helen McCrory) urges him to let the Royal Family hang itself publicly as ""a bunch of freeloading, anachronistic nutters."" This is one of the most involving stories of political machination ever put on film, and extraordinarily courageous in that it portrays still-living heads of state in ways that are sometimes far less than flattering (will Prince Philip dare sue?). All the performances are a resounding affirmation of the glories of British Rep (and in this I include Cromwell, the one American ringer in the cast). But the film stands or falls in its portrayal of Elizabeth, and with the wonderful, fabulous Helen Mirren playing her, it not only stands but soars. Mirren won the Best Actress Award at the Venice Film Festival for her performance, and if there's any justice she should start rehearsing her Oscar speech. Mirren is one of the great living masters in portraying deep emotion behind a dignified facade, and ""The Queen"" gives her an unprecedented opportunity to do just that. (Mirren's Elizabeth gives us the textbook definition of ""noblesse oblige:"" standing at the gates of Buckingham Palace, reading the placards that essentially accuse her of being Diana's murderer, she makes the slightest grimace of sorrow, then turns to the assembled crowd and smiles.) ""The Queen"" is simply one of the best films to come out of Britain in the last decade. I would love to see a double feature of this film and ""The Madness of King George""--in which Mirren played Queen Charlotte, the consort of George III. The House of Windsor might rebel at such an event, but the rest of us would be in for a treat.",1161129600,8,3422,5.088967971530249
1555944,5,B00005JPAM,"Monarchs have always faced threats to their thrones. So much so that royal history, burgeoning with fiendish conspiracies, violent plots, and gruesome assassinations, sometimes reads like a slasher novel. A few recent films have fully exploited this theme. 1998's ""Elizabeth"", starring the should-have-won-an-Oscar-for-this-role Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth I, revolved around an assassination attempt that included the queen's lover. On a less violent theme, Judy Dench, in ""Mrs. Brown"", depicted Queen Victoria's ""trist"" with a Highlander that had all of England alight with scandal. Has a new ""threatened queen"" genre emerged? Apparently so. Enter a rare film about a living monarch who finds her crown imperiled in an astonishingly novel way. For once Her Majesty can watch the drama she lived reemerge in celluloid - not that she probably wants to. Though the film sports a prosaic title, ""The Queen"", it boldly explores uncharted territory. Here the Queen, reigning in the late twentieth century hinterland between monarchy and non-monarchy, finds herself attacked by her own people. And she, much like the great-great-grandmother she shares with her husband, was not amused.

The film opens as Queen Elizabeth II sits for a regal portrait. Her world unfolds as the royal portraiteer dotes on his imperial subject. Then, in a ""we're not in Kansas anymore"" flash, the newly elected Tony Blair explodes onto the screen. The now ex-Prime Minister receives voluminous coverage for a movie entited ""The Queen."" One memorable early scene shows Blair bowing on one knee as the Queen inquires as to his desire to serve the nation. He answers ""yes."" That probably didn't give too much away. Both figures, Sovereign and Prime Minister, share the spotlight and their disparate worlds collide after catastrophe strikes.

News of Princess Diana's death soars over England. Actual news footage, now almost ten years old, gets woven with dramatization. The late Princess appears often. Tony Blair issues a eulogy almost immediately. But the royal family remains eerily silent, holed up in Balmoral, their Scottish getaway. The Duke of Edinburgh, depicted here as rather heartless and crass, shows more concern for hunting stags than the furor around the dead Princess. He even takes Diana's sons hunting as a diversion. Prince Charles, divorced for a year from Diana, remains the only one moved. He flies to France to bring the body of his ex-wife back to England. As the tension rises the film depicts him as nervous, fidgety, and fearing assassination. Regardless, he cannot alter his mother's public stoicism towards the tragedy. The Queen Mother provides some comic relief. When someone shows concern over photographers intruding on their son's hunt, she says nonchalantly, ""if there's a photographer he could be the first kill of the day.""

Soon bundles of flowers and messages of grief crowd the gate of Buckingham Palace. But no one's home. The flag, supporting royal traditon, remains lowered in the Queen's absence. Icy silence from the palace sours the public. They begin speaking out against the monarchy. This causes a drastic change in Tony Blair. He suddenly sees the interdependence of the Queen with his own station. In phone call after phone call he pleads with her to do something. She resists even after he gives her a vital statistic: one in four people now favor abolishing the monarchy. Que the Threatened Queen leitmotif. Princess Diana now seems to upstage the royal family even in death. Elizabeth II convinces herself that ""this mood"" will pass.

It doesn't. Slowly the idea that her people hate her sinks in. Bowing to pressure, the family inspects the bundles of grief displayed outside of Balmoral. They soon return to London and face the dense Buckingham crowds. Here the Queen sees what her public indifference has wrought. She reads ""They don't deserve you"" and ""They have your blood on their hands"" on some of the flowers. Here begins the Queen's transformation, criss-crossing with the Prime Minister's. Diana's death irreversably changes them both. Finally, probably more in deference to her public than to the dead Princess, the Queen finally issues a public statement. Blair's staff has the original text rewritten ""to make it appear like a human being wrote it."" But at this point Blair, who earlier said ""someone save these people from themselves"", now lashes out in defense as his aide mocks the Queen's sincerity. The fuse begins to fizzle.

The film explodes a haunting paradox. Royal tradition, often seen as the bulwark of the monarchy, here threatens to undermine the institution itself. Insisting on not raising Buckingham's flag to honor Diana and treating the tragedy as ""a private matter"" enfuriates the public. Stuff tradition. They demand a change of protocol. Subsequently, Britain turned upside down.

Of course a film depicting living breathing people fumbling through a crisis will inevitably draw controversy. Blair gets depicted as savior here, the steam in the engine. But the real Elizabeth II issued a statement that she decided to speak out all by herself. In her own words no one persuaded her actions. Not only that, Blair and the Queen have supposedly never divulged what passed between them during that tense week. Given that, this film presents an educated guess as to the workings of the English government during that time. One wonders what Tony Blair and the Queen really think of the film. One also wonders if the royal family and the Prime Minister really watch that much television.

The performances throughout remain stunning. Helen Mirren and Micheal Sheen shine as the protagonists/antagonists. Mirren's performance dazzles so much that viewers will forget that they're watching Helen Mirren. She presents an example of undetectable acting at its finest. And though no intense action takes place the film still provides a roller coaster ride. The actors and the direction by Stephen Frears, just off of ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"", obviously deserve credit here.

Best of all, ""The Queen"" allows viewers to come to their own conclusions surrounding that controversial week in 1997. Was the public right in lashing out at the monarchy? Was the Queen sincere in her famous ""grandmother"" speech? Was the monarchy really threatened? The film depicts the events without mashing opinions and answers in viewers' faces. Audiences can leave with vastly differing viewpoints. And what's better than great film? Having great conversations about great film. ""The Queen"" will doubtless keep tongues happily waggling for some time to come.",1161043200,276,6590,5.239810426540284
1555945,4,B00005JPAM,"I sympathize with the Royal Family.  They don't choose to be Royals.  They have very little choice what they do with their lives, really.  They can't vote, they can't run for office, and they can't be anonymous.  The worst part is that nobody else seems to have any sympathy for them because they have so much money.  As we all know, money buys happiness.

This is a docudrama, mostly about the week after Princess Diana's death.  Diana and several other characters in the movie ""appear as themselves,"" as it were, through news footage.  For that reason, we never see the two princes, even though much of the movie concerns them, and they are at Balmoral when the action takes place.  Their absence is a bit too conspicuous.

The drama comes from Tony Blair's desperate attempts to get the Queen to make more of a fuss over Diana's death.  To him, it is a no-brainer: the public is terribly upset and want their Queen to help them with their grief.  To Elizabeth II, it is all hype.  Why should the flag fly at half-mast at Buckingham Palace, when that isn't even done for people who still are part of the Royal Family?  The Queen must come to terms with the cult of celebrity.

The Queen and Tony Blair (ironically) are the most sympathetic characters in the movie.  Charles and Philip are played as buffoons, which I did not particularly care for.  These are complex people and, truth be told, we will never really know what life is like for that family, no matter how much we'd like to believe otherwise.",1161043200,4,1507,4.5427509293680295
1555946,5,B00005JPAM,"Long live Helen Mirren.

It is a complete mystery to me why Helen Mirren and Meryl Streep don't work more. They are easily the two best actresses working in film. I would think directors would be bending over backward for the opportunity to work with these two accomplished thespians. Instead, they are more easily able to get films with Kirsten Dunst and Julie Stiles made. Amazing. It just isn't the same, folks. It isn't the same.

""The Queen"", the new film from director Stephen Frears (""Dirty, Pretty Things"", ""The Crying Game""), concentrates on the week after Princess Diana's death. As the film progresses, we watch Queen Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) and Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) deal with the loss of someone in their lives as you would expect British Royalty to deal with such a thing, with a stiff upper lip. But this period is also significant in British history for another reason; a new Labour Prime Minister has just been elected. Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) recognizes Diana's death will not remain the isolated family affair the Royals insist it will be. Through many conversations, Blair attempts to get the Queen to make some sort of statement regarding her former step-daughter's death, to make some sign for the benefit of a grieving public. But as she and the family are spending the summer at their estate in Balmoral, Scotland, she remains steadfast in her feeling that this is a private family affair and any public grief will soon wear off.

""The Queen"" is a remarkable film for two reasons; the first and foremost is Helen Mirren. She is, once again, superb. If she isn't at least nominated for an Oscar, there is something seriously wrong with the whole system.

There is some humor in the film, but it is derived from watching the rigid ceremony and outdated tradition surrounding the family. Mirren could easily have portrayed the role as a jokey, caricature of the Queen, but her performance is much better, much more layered than that. She successfully paints a portrait of the Queen, and what her life is as a Royal, making the character, both good and bad, seem real. As she portrays the monarch, we watch as she moves through a life surrounded by tradition, a cocoon of advisors and servants, buffering her from the public, further reinforcing her feelings everything is going well. Convinced she is right, she doesn't heed the advice of her new Prime Minister, a figure she clearly `tolerates'. But as he continues to press the case, she gradually realizes he may be speaking the truth.

Mirren does a brilliant job of making us understand this woman's feelings. It seems perfectly understandable she would be so reluctant to believe the public does not require some statement from the Royal family, this is a private family affair and the British people are stalwart and dignified. As she gradually, very gradually, realizes perhaps she does need to address the public, this also makes sense. She remembers she is in the public eye, a spokesperson for the people, perhaps she should say something.

You have to remember Queen Elizabeth is part of a monarchy that has ruled England for centuries. There are traditions involved with the position and her life has been very different from a normal person. So, while her behavior may seem odd at first, we understand it through Mirren's performance. We certainly may not agree with it, but we see how it could happen. Throughout, there are many references to this, reminding us of the tradition the House of Windsor is steeped in.

Mirren is simply outstanding. Have I said that already?

The other person who is largely responsible for this film's success is director Stephen Frears. He keeps the film moving at a fast clip and the film is more entertaining for it. Usually, when you go to a biopic, you expect the film to reach the 2 hour plus mark. ""The Queen"" is a sprightly 95 minutes long. Because of this, Frears smartly concentrates on the week after Diana's death. He doesn't attempt to paint a complete picture of the monarch's life, choosing instead to illuminate this period. Because of this choice, we actually learn more about Queen Elizabeth and her family. The tragedy of Diana's death makes everything seem a little amplified, as though they are experiencing things they would normally experience over the course of a couple of years. Throughout, as we watch them deal with their traditions, and each other, we learn a lot about the traditions of their family, and the history.

Shortly after we meet the Queen and her new Prime Minister, the film abruptly shifts to the night of Diana's death. We watch as various images pop up, giving us an accurate feeling of what that night was like. Because Frears uses a quick series of images, we do some of the work, filling in the blanks with our imagination. It is an effective trick and works well to give us information and to keep the film moving along.

Throughout the film, the focus shifts back and forth from the Queen and the Windsors, to Blair, his staff and his wife. We quickly realize that Blair is trying to get through to the Queen for a number of reasons. The most important is that he genuinely feels the public needs to hear from her. But the political cache of getting the Queen to change her ways is not lost upon the young Labour official. When this eventually happens, a small smile crosses his lips. His wife is also incredulous about why he would care so much about the Queen. He notes that without her, he would not be possible, so it is in his best interest to help her maintain an air of dignity. I bring this up because it shows Frears is also interested in showing the politics of England at this time, and how all of these events affect one another.

""The Queen"" is a great film, much more sprightly, interesting and human that the traditional biopic. Now it is up to you to discover what the thousands of people who have been packing the limited engagement theaters have already discovered.",1160438400,10,5997,4.756730769230769
1555947,5,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirren is at the center of Stephen Frears' ""The Queen,"" a fictionalized film based on real events that took place in 1997.  Mirren physically and psychologically inhabits the role of HRH Elizabeth II, a monarch who never sought the heavy responsibilities that came with the crown, but who, for more than four decades, performed her role with dignity.

The film's main theme is the manner in which the royals reacted to the tragic death of Princess Diana.  Newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair, a ""modernist,"" believed that Diana should be mourned publicly and that flags should be flown in royal residences at half-staff.  In addition, he urged Elizabeth to make some sort of public statement to the British people, who criticized the Queen for grieving privately on her estate in Scotland.  How shocked Elizabeth was when she learned that some members of the press and public blamed her for Diana's unhappiness and subsequent death!  In one scene, a bewildered Elizabeth murmurs, ""It's a bad dream.""  On another occasion, she expresses her chagrin at the turn events have taken:  ""There's been a change--a shift in values.""  She cannot understand why, for the first time, members of the royal family should be expected to show their feelings in public.

Miss Mirren's stellar performance overshadows everyone else's in the cast, although James Cromwell is effective as a bombastic and insensitive Prince Philip and Michael Sheen does nice work as a callow Tony Blair who gradually grows into his new job as Prime Minister of England.  Although he is at first put off by Elizabeth's stiffness and formality, Blair later comes to admire her devotion to duty.  Alex Jennings, who does not physically resemble Prince Charles, plays the Prince as a compassionate man who, although he divorced Diana, still respected her devotion to William and Harry. Sylvia Syms plays the Queen Mum as a cartoonish matriarch who says whatever pops into her head.

Frears uses archival footage of Diana and the hordes who paid tribute to her memory to bring back the emotionally charged atmosphere of those dark days.  The director contrasts these crowd scenes with the eerily remote and silent castle to which Elizabeth and her family retreat following the death of the ""People's Princess.""  Was Elizabeth truly as uncaring and cold as she appeared to many members of the press and public?  Did the royals mistreat Diana and somehow cause her to act recklessly?  There are no easy answers to these questions, nor does Frears take a clear position on these issues.  ""The Queen"" is worth seeing for its satirical and incisive look at a particular time in British history when a venerated institution, the British monarchy, came under fire after the royal family failed to meet a challenge that they never expected to face--to be the mourners-in-chief for a woman whom they personally disliked but who was cherished by the entire world.",1160352000,5,2922,5.026970954356846

1556065,5,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirren is the Queen, plain and simple.  This film looks very serious, at first, but you quickly realize it is a satire, and at times a very funny one at that. It is also a historical, sober, piece about the death of Princes Diana and the reaction of the Royals.  And finally it is a loving tribute to the Queen, who apparently liked the film.

The basic story, Prime Minister Tony Blair is elected to modernize England, and the Royal family.  He is very modern, Just call me Tony to his staff.  Upon being told this, the Queen smiles and ask jokingly if they sent him a protocol sheet. (To make sure he knows how to act around her.)  Her assistant then comments that the PMs wifes curtsie was shallow at best.  The Queen smiles and comments that she did not worry about that type of thing, that is my sisters (Princes Margaret) job. Yes the Queen has a good sense of humor and likes to make jokes.

The film, based upon the actual events, presents a inside view into the Queens life.  After all she is the Queen, a wife, mother and grandmother and has to balance it all in full view of the world.  She had to protect her grandchildren after the death of their mother, consul a nation and follow 1000 year old protocols.  And deal with her son, a man of lesser backbone!

We also learn that the Queen drives, (she still drives) a Range Rover, on her large country estate.  In fact she drives it over a rock and breaks the crank shaft.  She gets of the car out wearing her big rubber boots, an old coat and a $1000.00 Herms scarf, inspects the damage and calls the Royal garage.  Im afraid that Ive done something stupid, Ive broken the crank shaft.  When asked how she knows it is a the crank shaft, She replies Dont forget I used to repair Jeeps during the war. Ive also damaged the four wheel drive box.  Yes, she is The Queen, a wife, mother, grandmother and mechanic too.

The film documents how the Queen is criticized by the people of her country for not commenting on the death and the PM convincing her to get involved which saves the day and her popularity. Apparently the two become friends as the film ends with the Queen joking with him as they take a walk around Buckinham Palace with her dogs.",1518307200,3,2212,4.327669902912621

The Story is a clash between the ""traditional"" attitude of the Queen, HM Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) and her immediate family with a more ""modernized"" view of the Prime Minister and his advisers on how the death should be handled.

There are many underlying factors that are well balanced in this movie with out changing the pathos to a monolog documentary. The addition of a stag being brought down by a clumsy paying guest on a neighboring estate can be both a metaphor and at the same time give the Queen a more-than-meets-the-eye appearance.

It is redressing to get a different perspective on the incident. As the Queen states,"" There has been a shift in values.""

1556213,5,B00005JPAM,"Excellent performance by Helen Mirren.  I truly felt like I was watching the real Queen of England. The story is basically about the summer 1997 incident when Princess Diana passed away, and how the Queen and her family dealt with the death while Tony Blair had just become the Prime Minister.  The movie mixed between actors and actual news footage of that period.  A really nice glimpse into the royal family and their ways of life.  Culturally interesting.  They did an amazing job in telling a story that doesn't necessarily make the Queen look bad in any way, just that the princess and the Queen did not have the best of relationships.",1499904000,,641,4.6875

Watching the clueless blue bloods go through tedious gyrations to finally address the public about the death of Diana is tiresome.  Tony Blair and his wife are portrayed as conniving, unfeeling bureaucrats.  And if you are hoping the royal family attains some form of enlightenment about their shameful behavior of Diana, you'll be disappointed.

At the end of the day, theirs was a rocky relationship of in-laws and divorce.  This is such a common theme in modern life and none of those who are players in such come out unscathed.  I have deep respect for both of these ladies.  I see both sides.  I don't think the Queen is as cold as the coldest perceptions of her, nor do I believe Diana was as self-centered as the most self-centered perceptions of her.  I'm glad they came around to see that the ENTIRE WORLD was going to weep for days, and that the people demanded a show of respect for Princess Di.",1498262400,7,722,4.303703703703704

1556337,5,B00005JPAM,"The Queen is a 2007 British family and political drama film, which centers around the response of the British Royal Family to the tragic death of Princess Diana, on August 31, 1997. Queen Elizabeth II was essentially in a state of shock after the death of Princess Diana, and her initial reaction was to guard the privacy of the Royal Family, and not confer the demise of Princess Diana with the status of an official Royal death. In contradistinction, both the newly-elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and Prince Charles himself, favored an official and public expression of grief, in order to afford the people of the United Kingdom with a proper venue for mourning their beloved Princess Diana. In addition, from a public relations perspective, it was believed that a sincere display of sympathy and empathy from Queen Elizabeth II, would certainly serve to comfort a devastated and grieving populace. The Queen represents a brilliant depiction of the traditions, protocols, and mindset of the Royal Family, as well as the complicated relationship between the monarchy, and the operational government, consisting of the Prime Minister and the Parliament. It also highlights the flexibility and adaptive leadership, and the sense of unity, which developed as a result of this terrible tragedy. The acting performance of Helen Mirren was absolutely spectacular, and the performances of Michael Sheen, James Cromwell, and the talented members of the supporting cast, were also stellar. In fact, the portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II by Helen Mirren was so accurate and so realistic, that, as the film progressed, the viewer came to believe that she actually was the Queen. The Queen is a decidedly interesting, intelligent, and engaging film, featuring superb development of the story line, and outstanding acting performances, which truly merits a five-star rating, along with a very enthusiastic recommendation.",1497744000,7,1912,5.313531353135313
1556338,5,B00005JPAM,"Here is a film all Americans should see, to better understand the monarchy that our nation broke from. That one young woman, Elizabeth the Queen, has dedicated her entire life to the service of the crown and her people, is a remarkable thing, unseen in our democracy. That the people of the United Kingdom still today support her steady regal hand that represents the thousand year's lineage of their nation, is remarkable, too. Queen Elizabeth who anchors the government of the United Kingdom and commands the respect of the world, is, indeed, the superstar of our times. Her robust nature, her very dignified nature, was challenged by the terrible death of Princess Dianna - and her decision for the good of her nation was to change. This film masterfully tells it and leads one down the halls of power few have the opportunity to enter. Once there, it is revealing to learn that even a queen has moments of anguish that must be dealt with, just as all of us do.",1497657600,6,964,4.643274853801169

1556341,5,B00005JPAM,"This is an outstanding film chronicling the week following Lady Diana Spencer's death. Helen Mirren turns in a flawless performance as Queen Elizabeth II, with Michael Sheen doing a terrific job in his portrayal of newly-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair. The rest of the cast is topnotch with very strong performances from James Cromwell as an outraged Prince Phillip and Roger Allam playing the role of Robin Janvrin (later Lord Janvrin), the Queen's quietly dignified private secretary. There isn't a weak performance in the entire film.

Rather than being about the passing of Diana, this movie is really about the passing of British tradition. Queen Elizabeth represents the age old custom in England of keeping one's emotions a strictly private affair clashing with celebrity-fixated public's need for an outpouring of grief. The Royal Family finds all this sensationalizing very distasteful and quite incomprehensible, whereas Prime Minister Blair, and the public, seem astonished by the Queen's utter lack of any genuine emotion. Therein lies the heart of this movie.

If your tastes lean toward this type of film, I assure you ""The Queen"" is well worth your time.",1497398400,13,1172,5.262032085561497
1556342,5,B00005JPAM,"Reading the film review I thought to myself ""how can this movie be least bit interesting"". I was very, very mistaken and believe now this movie will be ranked as one of best. Why? Helen Mirren acting is flawless and seamless, at NO point in the movie did I believe she wasn't the Queen of England. It wasn't that just believing she was queen, but her acting was superb. We see both her vulnerability and strength as she struggles with events that unfolded after the death of Diana Spencer. The supporting actors (especially Michael Sheen) were all very good with great set locations. I highly recommend this movie to ALL which appreciate quality film making and acting.",1497052800,,669,4.726495726495727
1556343,5,B00005JPAM,"I was never one for the Diana craze, she used the royal family and the press as much as they used her.  What happened after her death was a clash of generations as much as it was anything else.  To the older generations which were raised that one does not express their emotions in public and a young generation just beginning to embrace social media where you daily express your moods and your emotions it was the perfect juxtaposition.
The acting in the film is top notch and the script has just the right touch to take you from loathing of the Queen to endearment as you begin to understand the complexity of her sheltered life.  Most of us believe that royalty lives in the lap of luxury with none of the fears of day to day strife, but the truth is they are only in a gilded cage.",1497052800,2,785,4.25503355704698

 This is a very sad movie, and it's impossible for any of us to know how accurate it is, but I hope the British royal family was not as cold hearted and emotionally constipated as portrayed here. What a burden they were under if they had to suppress their own humanity for the sake of appearance and tradition. If this really happened, the queen was more sorrowful about the stag being killed than her grandchildren's mother, which was disturbing. The real film footage of that time, and especially the crowds and tributes they left for Princess Diana, brought back all the memories of that terrible and tragic event. I didn't like the portrayal of the prime minister at all as he insulted Princess Diana and defended the queen. Remember, Princess Diana was only 19 years old when she married, and her husband was having an affair at the same time. Such a dysfunctional family. Very, very sad all the way around.

1556982,4,B00005JPAM,"What can I say? Who doesn't know that Helen Mirren captures the essence of every role she accepts.  She has once again gotten this one spot on as the Queen of England. Beautifully done, as accurate as possible and having remembered this time myself when her highness and the royal family came under heavy scrutiny and criticism. A true story from the period of time when Princess Diana known as the ""People's Princes"" died in a tragic accident.  Seeing how the ""royals"" handled the entire situation and the awkwardness of having to be guided to do what the public demanded by showing an emotional response to the Princess's death not what the royals are used to doing was interesting. Had they not finally become flexible, the very throne of England may not have been considered necessary. (However, I doubt few Brit's think there IS any real need to waste the millions of dollars yearly on the royals because of ""tradition"" is even necessary and the funds spent wiser elsewhere.) Very entertaining and Ms. Mirren basically carries the entire movie with incredible grace and wonderful talent.",1473033600,,1092,4.897297297297297
1556983,5,B00005JPAM,I had watched it first at the cinema and enjoyed it. I think I liked it more watching it for the second time as I could appreciate the symbolism more and the tragic consequences for the Monarchy. It is compelling and fascinating to remember the events from my own prospective at the actual time of Dianna's tragic death and then see the private political goings on at Windsor Castle.,1472860800,,383,4.565217391304348

1557263,5,B00005JPAM,"This comes off as a very respectful film.  While it does portray Queen Elizabeth as quite domineering in some respects, it also helps us to understand why and to see that she carries out her role as Queen at all times in the manner she believes is morally right and that fits her obligations that she doesn't take lightly.  I'm not much for re-watching films in general, but I had seen this when it was released in the theater and seeing it again, I was once again engaged and even though I knew what would happen I stopped what else I was doing (I'm usually always doing something when watching TV/movies) and focused on it.  The performances are all excellent except for perhaps that of Prince Charles -- maybe it's apt, but it seemed a bit too much of a caricature for me.",1463788800,,775,4.405594405594406

1557419,5,B00005JPAM,Very good,1461110400,,9,4.0
1557420,5,B00005JPAM,"I saw this movie when it first came out in 2006, and recently showed it to my journalism class specifically to examine the public relations aspects of the story--how the prime minister's office worked with Queen Elizabeth to shape the public perception of the tragic death of Princess Diana. Helen Mirren's performance is stunning and nuanced. The scene of the queen alone in the wilderness when her car breaks down, and the 14-point buck appears, is stunning in all it suggests with profound subtlety about the queen's humanity and personal feelings. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in the events surrounding the 1997 situation, in the British royal family, in recent history, and in a top-notch movie.",1461024000,,721,5.067226890756302
1557421,5,B00005JPAM,This is an excellent film.  Helen Mirren' s portrayal is so engrossing that you forgot you are watching an actress and it seems like you are watching Queen Elizabeth herself.  I highly recommend this film.,1461024000,,205,4.828571428571428
1557422,5,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirren is the best.  Everything she does it outstanding.  I've seen this movie several times, will see it again.",1461024000,,118,4.85
1557473,4,B00005JPAM,"Included with my STARZ subscription is the movie The Queen, starring Helen Mirren in her Oscar-winning performance as Elizabeth II. I had not seen the movie at the theater.

It would help if I got in the habit of reading a synopsis before watching a movie. To my detriment, I just clicked and streamed not realizing the movie focused on the death of Princess Diana. Reliving that episode in history only turned me into a blubbering fool at eleven oclock at night. Needless to say, it resurrected the images and sadness over the terrible accident that took her life far too soon.  Be forewarned, you will see again actual news footage that could cause tears.

As far as the remainder of the movie, it attempts to showcase the reaction of the Royal Family regarding her death and that in particular of Queen Elizabeth. When watching re-enactments of private affairs behind closed doors that historically occurred, its hard to know what to believe. Were their reactions portrayed truthfully because of a tidbit of gossip garnered from former staff or was it pure conjecture? I haven't looked into that matter to determine if any of it rang true.

Nevertheless, history will probably all agree that the silence from the Royal Family during this period did nothing to endear the monarchy with the general public. The stiff upper lip mentality and adherence to private grief, only made Elizabeth appear cold and uncaring. As far as Prince Philippe, I would like to think that the man privately is far better in character than the terrible portrayal of coldness given to him in the movie. Thankfully, the movie did one thing right. The boys who played the young princes were never shown by their face or had speaking parts in the movie  a respectful decision.

I suppose that one must understand that at this point in the Queens life, she is only reacting to how she was raised. However, the people cannot relate to her cloistered as a figurehead behind closed doors, which is why everyone loved Diana so much. She was indeed the peoples princess, and the outpouring of grief from the nation and world was deserved. Unfortunately, Elizabeth did not realize, at least in the movie, how beloved her former daughter-in-law had been. She, on the other hand, has become hated, which is something that she has never experienced in her life or realized for that matter.

Helen Mirrens performance won her an Oscar in 2007, beating out such greats as Cruz, Streep, Dench, and Winslet. As Elizabeth, she fit the role well. I have read that the queen did give Helen a nod of approval for her performance. Michael Sheen portrayed Tony Blair, who I thought did an excellent job. The movie also holds interest for a peek behind closed doors at the lives in the palace and the stunning scenery at Balmoral Castle. Frankly, I wouldnt mind being cloistered away from the world there either.

Now twenty years later, it is fair to say that the monarchy has gained a resurgence of popularity in the eyes of the people. Elizabeth, now about to become ninety and the longest reigning monarch, has changed over the years. She is now more of a peoples queen and touchable. Of course, Dianas two boys, are admired throughout the world. Diana certainly continues to live through her sons, having taught them values to be respected. It is good to know that even after her death, Diana was instrumental in changing the monarchy.",1461024000,3,3395,4.7815699658703075
1557474,5,B00005JPAM,"I would purchase from this seller again. I got my order sooner than I expected. I love Helene Mirren, so when I ordered this dvd I knew I would enjoy her performance no matter how much I thought the storyteller would show bias for Diana or the Royal family. To my surprise and delight, I was glad there was no slant toward either. Only a story about how the people of England mourned (as did the rest of the world including me) versus the choice the Queen attempted to maintain privacy at the death of the Princess of Wales. The people thought one way, and the Queen another way.",1460851200,,579,4.321100917431193

A compelling behind the scenes glimpse of the emotional struggle the royal family wrestled with while dealing with the sudden tragic passing of Lady Diana and the diplomatic role played by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in helping the Queen in particular recognize that the modern English monarchy is sustained by a delicate thread of public love and support.  That thread, it is learned, has ""strings attached"" (no pun intended).  The story unfolds as a delicate dance between an anachronistic institution with it's unyielding ""stiff upper lip"" traditions, not to mention the Queen's lingering resentment of Lady Di's public rebellion against most things royal, and an expectant public yearning for a display of respect and loss from the royals that reflected their own heartfelt grief.  In the end wise counsel is heeded, Diana's life is suitably honored, a restive public is soothed and the monarchy is preserved.",1455580800,,954,5.298013245033113

1557688,5,B00005JPAM,"You almost forget this is a film.  So natural were the actors in their roles - it wasn't convincing, it didn't even appear as if they were acting.  The gorgeous, versatile, formidable actress Helen Mirren plays Queen Elizabeth II, and the transformation is stunning.  Not just physically, but in manners - the Queen is careful, precise, and rigid.  I felt it was actually watching a documentary - that is how deeply Mirren embodied Queen Elizabeth II.

Prince Philip is perfunctory and aloof.  It is apparent he is more of a courtesy than a real husband, confidant, and friend, and Elizabeth's mother is proper but dithering.  All are oblivious of Princess Diana's extreme popularity; though her ex-husband, Prince Charles, mourns the death of his ex-wife, the mother of his children.  (Yes, he is in love with spunky Camilla Parker-Bowles, who captivates him, but he had also had a fatherly affection for Princess Diana, and you sense that he is broken-hearted.  He never wished her harm.)  He wants to go to Paris to collect Diana's body, but his mother does not understand.

Tony Blair/Michael Sheen, the new prime minster, thinks the royal family is acting abdominally, and he is aghast that they had not shown more concern.

This is a fascinating film.  You sense Queen Elizabeth's personal feelings, her conviction that she is always doing the right thing.  But she must confront that she is not always right.  You sense that she feels betrayed by her people, because she has sacrificed everything for them, but they do not love her like they love Princess Diana.",1448150400,,1569,4.91254752851711

The scene with the stag was affecting and moving and perhaps gave her some insight into what Diana went through, being hounded by the media to her death.

1558259,5,B00005JPAM,"The Queen is a British drama film directed by Stephen Frears, written by Peter Morgan, and starring Helen Mirren in the title role, Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. Released almost a decade after the event, the film depicts a fictional account of the immediate events following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.

The main plot focuses on the differing views in how to deal with the death of Diana. The Royal Family, while on their summer residence at Balmoral Castle, sees her death as a private affair, not to be treated as an official Royal death, in contrast with newly appointed Prime Minister Tony Blair and Diana's ex-husband Prince Charles, who attempt to reflect the public wish for an official expression of grief. Matters are further complicated by the media, royal protocol regarding Diana's official status, and wider issues about republicanism.

Full of wit, humor, and pathos, this moving portrait of the British royals during the period after Princess Diana's death features not one but two remarkable performances, that of Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and Michael Sheen as the newly-ordained Prime Minister Tony Blair. They embody their characters and lay bare the motivations behind these prominent people, giving viewers a glimpse into the inner workings of the British monarchy. This movie allows us to understand just how heavy the crown really sits and what is it like to be the Queen. In summary,it was an unqualified triumph that works on all levels.",1430179200,,1487,5.040650406504065

1558335,4,B00005JPAM,"A lot better than I would have thought given the subject material.

First I have to say this. Very few if any movies about historical events portray them in an accurate way. If you expect that from any movie, you will  feel cheated by the movie.

I doubt anyone knows with any certainty what the characters portrayed did or felt at the time. This is mostly about a fairly private group of people (the royal family) along with some politicians and how they dealt with the death of Diana and the subsequent public spectacle. The people who value their privacy are not going to tell anyone anything of substance about what they felt or did, and politicians can't be trusted to open their mouths without outright lying. The movie no doubt got a few tidbits here and there correct, but on the whole there is just no way to know how much of it is reasonably accurate and how much is mostly movie fantasy.

However, if you take it as a drama rather than a faithful retelling of history, it is pretty good. The queen is depicted as not understanding why the public is so engrossed with Diana and taking a long time to figure out what to do. Probably not real far from the truth. Tony Blair comes off as the guy who tries to save the monarchy from itself.

The British public is depicted as being slaves to celebrity, something that is also probably not real far from the truth.

All in all, an interesting and entertaining movie.",1427760000,2,1421,4.446153846153846

1558392,5,B00005JPAM,"This is a very interesting and seemingly true account of the personal and public life of the Queen.  It is absent of all of the trash that I have read in the tabloids regarding the royal family.  I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I especially enjoy seeing Prince Phillip depicted as a decent, loving husband.  The Queen seems to value his thoughts on various matters that are important to her royal duties and to their private household.  The book mentions that he often makes inappropriate comments but that he is not the bumbling fool that the newspapers make him out to be.  All in all, it is a wonderful book and I have recommended it to several people.",1426896000,,671,4.558333333333334

1558394,5,B00005JPAM,"On August 31, 1997, a car crash in a Parisian tunnel paralyzed a nation with grief, put a government in crisis, and alienated a beloved royal family from its subjects. That crash took the life of Lady Diana Spencer, formerly the Princess of Wales, and the mother of the second-in-line  heir to the British throne.

""The Queen,"" starring Helen Mirren, Michael Sheen, and James Cromwell, is a beautifully acted, masterfully written, and historically accurate drama that chronicles the events that occurred in Britain in the aftermath of Princess Diana's death. Written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Frears, it examines why the British royal family, led by Queen Elizabeth II, was both unable and unwilling to deal effectively with Diana's sudden death; and shows the rift that developed between the royal family, Britain's newly elected government, and the British public.

In the early morning hours of August 31st, while staying with her family at her summer palace in Scotland, the Queen is awakened told that Diana has just been killed in a car crash in Paris. The Queen, her husband Prince Philip, and the Queen Mother all maintain a curious indifference to the news.

In London, newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair becomes the public face of the tragedy.  As he tries to coordinate long-distance funeral arrangements for Diana with the vacationing Queen, he is met with frustration. Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip, and the Queen Mother are all opposed to the idea; because Diana is no longer considered a ""royal,"" they want a strictly private funeral.

The monarch steadfastly refuses to interrupt the family's vacation for any reason.  This puts the royal family increasingly at odds with the Prime Minister, and especially the British public.  Blair, always the consummate politician, has read the public mood accurately; he advises the Queen that his latest internal polling indicates that one in four Britons currently favors abolishing the monarchy altogether...

Will the Queen agree to a state funeral and make a public appearance? Watch this outstanding film to find out.

There many, many positive things to say about this fine movie. The acting is simply marvelous throughout. Helen Mirren won a Best Actress Academy Award for her marvelous performance as the British monarch, and Michael Sheen performs to perfection as Prime Minister Tony Blair. James Cromwell matches Mirren's performance with his own, as the Duke of Edinburgh.

""The Queen's"" screenplay is brilliant. Dialogue is always sharp, witty where appropriate, acerbic at times, and always fascinating. The film's pace never flags. Sets and costumes brilliantly reflect the times. ""The Queen"" is historically accurate, although some events have naturally been compressed or altered in the interests of time.

From its opening scenes to its closing credits, ""The Queen"" is entertainment at its very best. Highly recommended.",1426377600,4,2913,5.2813852813852815

1558396,3,B00005JPAM,"The  problem with the film is that as good as Helen Mirren is, the screenplay is far from the truth. We know much more about the events that are the basis of the story now, so the film has already become dated. The Queen herself has come out of this troubled time in history more loved and more respected than ever, and today the British public today seems embarrassed by the near hysterical outpouring of grief that accompanied the tragic death of  the troubled, much loved Princess Diana. I thought it was ordinary when it was first released, and I still do. On the plus side, it's lovely to look at.",1426032000,2,602,4.414414414414415

However, I will make a brief comment here: Helen Mirren is excellent in her role as the queen, although the material written for her, and most of the other characters, doesn't have much depth.  Because the focus of the movie revolves around the death of Princess Diana, the characters seem drawn from the tabloids of that time.

1558860,4,B00005JPAM,"I remember the days after Diana was killed. The pain of the world was great; it was puzzling that that the Royals did not 'get' this agony, and thereby hangs the tale of 'the Queen'.
But I was touched by the film and it is good to be reminded that celebrities too are human beings with strengths, weaknesses and frailties. Certainly this event was beyond precedent and even Tony Blair's young creative spirit was tried. Much of the premise has to do with the young Prime Minister trying to save the Queen - from herself.
I smiled when the Queen Mother realised they were using the plan for 'her' funeral to do Diana's. She looked quite put-out.
The architecture was lovely, interiors beautiful and the teacup that the Queen's tea was becoming cold in was very elegant. Wonder if it was Royal Doulton.
The film was very human, Mirren did a great job. Enjoyed the Blair family scenes too. Loved the scenes at Balmoral. The story of the Stag was a nice touch. And the fact that the Queen can tinker with machinery, given that was the job she did in the War.
Nothing can stay the same, Time tries everything. Everything can change. That must be bewildering to a Family who is steeped in Tradition and Protocol.",1411948800,2,1206,4.536697247706422

1558866,5,B00005JPAM,"For me personally, I remember vividly what I was doing and where I was the minute I heard the news of the tragic auto accident in a Paris tunnel. In the movie, Buckingham Palace was adamant on respecting the wishes of the Spencers (Diana's family) for a private ceremony. After several days, the British people became angry that the royal family were not making any public appearances or statements and not showing enough remorse. As antipathy increased, it was inferred, because of Prince Charles' paranoid behavior and heighten security measures taken, that an assassination threat had been made, directed at him. Very solicitous Tony Blair worked assiduously, and with alacrity, to convey the gravitas of the countries' sentiments to the Queen. Mr. Blair, just elected as prime minister in a landslide victory, was more in touch with the mood of the people. Whereas the royal family was somewhat sheltered and insular except for the news they watched on T.V. or read in the newspapers. The Queen thought the press at fault for using inflammatory headlines to polarize and foment opinions that vilified her. After nearly a week, however, the prime minister was instrumental in persuading the Queen to change her position and meet the Briton's demand for a public tribute. Tony Blair's candor and defense of the Queen against bias accusations from his wife and staff was meritorious. And, ultimately, this is why he was so influential ingratiating himself with Queen Elizabeth, because she intuitively felt that he was working in her best interest. It may sound far-fetched, but there was speculation that Mr. Blair had been the 'savior' of the monarchy by adverting a possible revolution to overthrow the British form of hereditary government.",1409875200,,1745,5.126315789473685

It was a movie that might have made the HRH look bad, but I think it actually did the opposite in that it showed some humanity and, most of all, showed why the royal family earns/deserves respect.",1403827200,,307,4.368421052631579
1559115,5,B00005JPAM,"Hellen Mirren's performance is a an amazement.  The movie pulls you in, and for those old enough to remember, transports you back to that horrible week.  The portrayals are so convincing that By the end of the movie its hard to remember that its only actors and not the actual Queen, Tony Blair, and Prince Charles.  Its must see.",1403049600,,330,4.559322033898305
1559116,4,B00005JPAM,One thing Helen Mirren could not  do it seems is age like the Queen.  The writing was quite satirical when it came to depicting the royals and their staff people.  The  exaggerated fuddy-duddy-ness took away from the readability of the Queen.  She was not presented as the full woman that she is.  The focus on merely what was proper to do in the situation of Diana's death left the Queen and Queen Mum looking very shallow.  Perhaps she is hide bound to too much tradition.  She is never-the -less is a complex person. The movie did not reveal the depth of either the Queen or the Prime Minister.  If could have been a much better character study of them both.,1402876800,2,661,4.441666666666666
1559117,4,B00005JPAM,Very interesting movie. We bought it ahead of our trip to London just to garner some insight (even if some of it was fabricated) about the Royal family. It was fascinating.,1402876800,,172,4.580645161290323

1559191,5,B00005JPAM,"I love this movie. To me, it's just about perfect in every way--story, dialogue, acting, pace. Watching Helen Mirren, you forget you're watching a movie and not a reality show following Queen Elizabeth about on her daily life. And Michael Sheen is a better Tony Blair than Tony Blair. If Blair's first meeting with the Queen as prime minister went differently than depicted here, I don't want to know about it.",1402531200,,410,4.788732394366197

1559272,5,B00005JPAM,"The performance by Helen Mirren is so good and so subtle.  The relationship between the Queen and the Prime Minister is complex and interesting.  I think they unfairly made Charles look like a fool, but that's just me.  Never was a huge fan of Diana so perhaps the movie sits well with me because it was less sychophantic than most movies who use Diana as a subject.",1398643200,,366,4.432835820895522

I'm stupid enough to continue to get merchandise from this site knowing they don't really care about how their shipping policy stinks. UPS or FED X must come to town anyway, but instead of dropping off at the house, they drop at the post office and makes the customer go to the post office to pick up their package, only if it doesn't fit in the mailbox. Sometimes leaves outside the door, my merchandize that I purchased unsecured that allows anyone to walk by and grab. If you complain you're referred to the post office.

of Queen Elizabeth.
Helen managed to capture her voice, speech patterns, mannerisms...posture...
and best of all her person. By that I mean...her confidence, power, sense of duty, and of one in
control.
Hair and makeup.....also amazing.
The rest of the cast provide excellent support....but it really is all about Queen Elizabeth II.

As is so often true when she takes on a role, she truly *becomes* the queen. I don't suppose Her Majesty much enjoyed Mirren's portrayal, but I believe most other viewers will find it quite compelling indeed.",1393113600,2,345,5.017543859649122

We will never find out what went really on at Balmoral in the days after Princess Diana's death, the diaries of the people involved won't be published in this century, but one could assume that parts of it came pretty close.
I would think that anyone who is interested in the Royal Family will find this movie quite interesting. I would like to add that 'Prince Charles' is an epic fail in this movie and 'Queen Mum' is also slightly off, but 'Tony Blair', 'Prince Philip' and 'Robert Janvrin' are absolutely spot on.",1392768000,,687,4.4603174603174605

As soon as she hears it has been shot, she jumps into her Land Rover to go and see it! She later sees it hanging, decapitated,butchered, and she cries.

I thought it would be boring because I lived through that time and thought I knew everything that went on but the acting was good and there was a lot of stuff I didn't remember or didn't know.

1559539,5,B00005JPAM,"Love it-- Helen Mirran is great. Initially, Queen Elizabeth (Mirran) does seem distant and dis-engaged from some of the realities of modern day life. However, the part where Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) castigates his staff, referring to Elizabeth II's life long service-- a life she never asked for--is very affecting as it is certainly true.
The end in hindsight is pretty ironic as PM's come and go-- the monarch continues!",1381622400,,424,5.071428571428571

1559606,5,B00005JPAM,"I'd been the movie before but wanted to refresh the details of the death of Princess Diana in my mind.  As I watched, I struck by how like the social structure and customs surrounding the British Royal Family were to those seen in Downton Abbey--fictional but a good representation of life seventy years earlier in time.  It was as though society had moved forward for everyone--except British royalty.
Contrast that with the recent birth of Prince George and the informality surrounding that!  The very much ""looser"" attitude may not have come about were it not for the reaction of the English people to their leaders' seeming lack of response to the death of Diana.",1379116800,,667,4.833333333333333

1559610,3,B00005JPAM,Seems to me that history told us that The queen was more vicious than this movie portrayed her to be.  The drama in this movie was slow but goes to show you how a monarchy holds on to the money they live on.,1377561600,,207,3.813953488372093

Between the Queen and 'call me Tony' Blair, Prince Charles, and Prince Philip, even the small exhibition of coldness between the Princes Philip and Charles near the end, all well done.

1559681,5,B00005JPAM,"Everyone knows about Princess Diana and the unfortunate circumstances around her death. What you don't really ever see (in my experience) is the story from the Queen's perspective. This is just that. The move takes place around the time of Diana's death and is primarily told through the lens of the Queen. It sets up a good dichotomy between the ""establishment"" (royals and nobility) and everyone else. You really get a great perspective on just how differently they think compared to the rest of us.

The Queen is pretty aloof, and throughout the film, you are left wondering if she really ever cared about Diana. If this movie is any indication, her feelings towards her were cool at best. However the Queen isn't heartless--she believes at her core she knows the British people better than anyone, but when they turn on her because of her reaction to the death, it really shakes her, and that's what the movie is mostly about, how the Queen deals with her belief system being threatened.",1374537600,,991,4.795321637426901

1559733,3,B00005JPAM,"First, Helen Mirren gives a predictably fine performance.  The script was written with a completely uneducated viewer in mind, a viewer with absolutely no sense of modern history nor of the nature of the English monarchy.  I found the constant Cliiff notes inserted into every actor's mouth at every available opportunity to be both insulting and distracting.  The writers were absolutely incapable of moving the story line without inserting some ""Wait!  Our audience won't know that the Queen's uncle abdicated!  Which character can say that?  Wait!  The audience won't know the Queen was a mechanic during WWII so let's have her truck break down right in the middle of Diana's funeral so we can give them that bit -- then they'll now we really did our homework!""

The rest of the cast was lackluster; in their defense, they doubled as a Greek chorus, inserting the writers' Cliff notes.  Casting seemed to depend on how the writers felt about a given character rather than on an actor's ability to bring that character to life.  Clearly, the writers hate Charles and Prince Philip and had them portrayed as spineless, repulsive sponges rather than displaying any attempt at insight into their characters or behavior.  Tony and Cherie Blair were out and out cartoon characters: dancing little flat figures flitting across the screen with absolutely no idea why they were there.

I'd never advise anyone to skip a Mirren performance but do be aware that you're letting yourself in for a great deal of peripheral annoyance from script writers and secondary cast if you watch this.  And, if you watch it once, you'll never watch it again, so borrow it or rent it.  Spend your money on Elizabeth I!",1372982400,2,1695,4.901754385964912

Obviously this story's depiction of the royal family's reaction is pure conjecture.

She was a woman with dignity and honor and expected that from all that were aroound her or that touched her life or family.  Unfortunately the world did a radical change and she was not ready to experience it.  Her disdain for Diana was something that she couldn't even understand herself and therefore she wanted to not acknowledge it or her. To her Diana was out of sight so she was out of her mind.  In the movie she appears to be cold and callous but as it goes on you begin to see her soften.

I did not enjoy how much the writer and director left out the fact that the Queen has a sense of humor and enjoys a good laugh. The Queen is a well rounded human being and in this portrayal of her she is depicted as a straight faced, sometimes harsh, woman who cares more for animals than people. A little bit of tenderness would have gone a long way to make this a much more enjoyable experience. That being said I cannot fault the portions of the film that show the palace and castles as a back drop to the story of a woman who has dedicated her life to her people and done an excellent job of it. I have a feeling that the writers' and produces' depiction of Elizabeth is their feelings and not the full measure of Elizabeth.

1560021,4,B00005JPAM,"The words that spring to mind when I think of this film are ""beautifully understated."" That description is apt in describing Helen's Mirren's stellar portrayal of Elizabeth II, as well.

Viewing this film as a born-and-bred American, I came away from it viewing the monarchy with new, sympathetic eyes. This isn't to say I'm now pro-monarchy...there's a scene toward the beginning of the film that's utterly priceless, where Tony Blair gets down on one knee while the Queen invites him to set up a government in her name. Michael Sheen played that scene with just the right amount of embarrassment: he looked chagrined, and like he felt like a fool, and he was right to feel that way because it looked utterly ridiculous, something so out-of-place in our time. But as the film progressed, I, like the Tony Blair character, began to have a reluctant admiration for the queen even when I disagreed with her and all she stood for. After all, this is a woman whose formative years took place during WWII, a time when ""keep calm and carry on"" was her nation's mantra. I got the sense that she wasn't cold-hearted so much as a hopeless product of her time...a time that is long past.

I even felt sympathy for Prince Charles as portrayed by Alex Jennings. I got the sense that his sorrow over the loss of his sons' mother was enhanced by his guilt over his treatment of her, which made him a bit more likeable for me. (That said, I still despise the real Charles for being such a weakling as to let his mother pressure him into leaving the woman he truly loved and marrying a woman he didn't love, an innocent, inexperienced, overly emotional and highly strung young girl with whom he had nothing in common but a pedigree - and then behaving like a dog after he did marry her instead of committing to the marriage.) The director's decision to not have William and Harry be portrayed onscreen was a sensitive and wise one, I think.

My husband is fond of saying that everyone is a package, made up of good and bad parts. I was reminded of that watching this film...many people tend to vilify either Charles or Diana or the Royal family in general, when the truth is that, like most families, each of them made some pretty horrific mistakes and did some stupid things, sometimes with the best intentions, sometimes for personal gain.

Beautifully acted, beautifully directed, beautifully written...and all-around great character study and portrayal of cross-generational conflicts.

The princess is seen only in television news clips and photographs as the film remains fixed on Elizabeth and her relationship with the newly elected prime minister, Tony Blair.  Helen Mirren's performance as Elizabeth is so subtle and fine it is easy to overlook its greatness.

1560266,5,B00005JPAM,"Just as every American knows where they were on 9/11, every Brit knows what they were doing when the news came in that Princess Diana had been killed in a car accident in Paris. Heck, I was a thirteen year old New Zealander and I still remember running home from my grandmother's house (having seen the news report on television) to tell my parents what had occurred. It was a shocking, confusing, upsetting time, and for anyone who remembers the media circus in the wake of the princess's death, ""The Queen"" provides a fascinating look at what might have been going on among those who were affected by it most.

In 1997 the British public elected in a new Prime Minister by a landslide majority; he was Tony Blair - young, popular, and with republican sympathies. In many ways he was the polar opposite of Queen Elizabeth II in nearly every respect, and their initial relationship (at least as it's depicted here) was rather cool. Yet not long after Blair officially accepts the position, a much greater news story sweeps the country: Princess Diana has been killed in a car accident. Yet her death is just the background for the central dynamic of the film: the tentative alliance that forms between Blair and the Queen, and the questions that arise surrounding the nature of grief, and how it should be displayed.

As the public begin to grieve their loss, they grow increasingly frustrated by the silence emitting from the royal family. Though the Queen insists that she must attend to her grandchildren and maintain dignity by not indulging the media, the public clamors for a more shared display of regret. They want flags flying at half-mast without understanding the protocol behind it. They want televised eulogies from every minister, celebrity and royal family member in existence. They demand that the Queen ""lead the people in grief"", whatever that means. They gather en-masse at the gates of Buckingham Palace to light candles and lay flowers for a woman they'd never even met.

The Queen is baffled by it all, stating: ""we do things quietly in this country, and with dignity,"" but in doing so, seriously misreads the mood of her people. Blair on the other hand, steps up to the plate, coins the term ""the people's princess"" in his eulogy and increases his own popularity. Witnessing the growing antipathy toward the Queen, he tries to advise her to address her people, only to be met with stubbornness and pride. Something has to give, and Blair knows that the longer it takes for the Queen to make a public statement, the more it will seem as though she's simply bowing to public pressure.

At the time it all happened, I really had no idea of the furor surrounding the actions (or inactions) of the royal family until much later after the event. Only by watching this film did I really begin to grasp the circumstances of that time. One suspects that most of the frenzy was whipped up by the media who needed a scapegoat for - if not Diana's death - than at least the aftermath, but the royals' inability to judge the needs/wants of the people was a serious oversight on their behalf. The film shows remarkable restraint in providing an impartial look at the events of those sad weeks, presenting the backstage events as they (may have) occurred, and thus allowing the audience to reach their own conclusions as to what should have happened regarding the public and the palace.

The film concentrates mainly on the relationship between Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth, specifically Blair's changing attitude toward the Queen; initially finding all the pomp and circumstance rather silly, getting immensely frustrated with the lack of cooperation from the palace, and finally delivering a final impassioned speech in the Queen's defense that is the closest the film gets to taking a side in the whole affair. (And as the Queen astutely points out afterwards, the reason Blair is so sympathetic to her plight is that he knows all too well that the public could turn on him just as easily - as indeed they did ten years later in the wake of the war on Iraq).

Helen Mirren won the Oscar that year for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth, and it's not difficult to see why. Capturing the mannerisms and speech patterns of the Queen without making it look as though she's trying too hard, Mirren presents a woman who is both strong and fragile, determined yet easily-led, wise in certain circumstances but foolish in others, witty and yet detached - in other words, a fully formed woman struggling with a PR challenge that she can't fully understand. There's a lovely moment in which the Queen is by herself out in the countryside (her car just having broken down) and she's facing away from the camera, allowing herself to cry over the ordeal for the first time. We're not sure why - is it for Diana? For the way she's been treated by the public? But whatever the reason, she eventually composes herself, and her face resettles into its dour ""game face"". Right in front of your eyes she goes from a woman to a Queen.

Michael Sheen (who has played Tony Blair twice before in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deal/dp/B0010X73Z6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Special-Relationship/dp/B003N9ASF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Special Relationship</a>) is clearly quite at home playing this particular character, and James Cromwell provides quite a scathing rendition of the boorish, thick-headed Prince Philip, whose main contribution to events is to give his wife consistently bad advice. Alex Jennings is a nervy but surprisingly sympathetic Prince Charles and Sylvia Syms gets some of the best lines as the Queen Mother (""nobody tells me anything,"" she snipes at one point). Wisely, Princes William and Harry are out-of-focus for the entirety of the film, appearing only from behind or from a distance. It's a respectful portrayal of the two individuals who were undoubtedly hurt the most by this entire ordeal, and director Steven Frears is mindful of their privacy.

Speaking of whom, the real fascination with this film is how director Steven Frears and writer Peter Morgan manage to make it so darn interesting. Considering all it really involves is various people watching news reports, discussing things in conference rooms, attending press conferences and uncertainly moving from one place to the next, it's quite remarkable that the whole thing remains so rivetingly fast-paced (ironically, their shared DVD commentary is deathly boring). Replicating speeches that were said and outfits that were worn, as well as using stock footage and newsreels that aired at the time, all provide a sense of authenticity and immediacy. Little bits of trivia are peppered throughout (the Queen cannot vote; she was a mechanic in wartime) and though some segments can feel a bit heavy-handed (the symbolism surrounding that stag!) it remains a film that's fundamentally about topics not many people can resist: the lives that go on behind closed doors, the one-sided relationship that exist between leaders and followers, the frenzy of gossip and the media, the manipulative tactics of public relations, and of course - those royals.

It tells of the ordeals of a short period of time, from the election of Tony Blair, P.M., the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the mixed feelings about that loss.  Elizabeth, II, is protrayed as a rigid, if not defiant, Royal, but one who must respond properly to the deep almost universal grief of her subjects.  It is a new light on the importance of maintaining the monarchy, the great affection and wish to protect her grandsons, and become less ""royal"" and more like her people.  If the film even approaches the reality of the time, it shows her own grief to be held privately only to be released when no one else could see nor hear her quiet sobs.

1560435,5,B00005JPAM,"After watching ""The Kings Speech"", I dug out ""The Queen"" from my movie collection. I had enjoyed watching it before but enjoyed it even more the second time. Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair were phenomenal. I didn't really care for Alex Jennings as Prince Charles but then again, I don't really care for Prince Charles. Prince Philip was very well played by James Cromwell although portrayed as harsh, cruel, and uncaring.

The movie takes place in the weeks after Princess Diana's accidental death in 1997 and intersperses actual news footage throughout. A newly elected Tony Blair immediately gives a speech but the royal family isolate themselves in Balmoral and refuse to acknowledge Diana's death publicly. Queen Elizabeth believes in handling everything privately, Tony Blair, newly elected, tries to pursuade her that the people want more. Prince Charles, played rather sympathetically in this film, also tries to influence the Queen but she does not agree. The press begin to harshly criticize the royal family, the public becomes angry and begin speaking out against the royal family, and Tony Blair continues to plead with the Queen to reconsider and 'be there' for her people.

Mirren is fantastic as the dignified yet somewhat vulnerable Queen. The part where the family finally return to England and walk amongst the flowers and notes left outside the castle, many of the notes expressing harsh feelings towards the monarchy, gave me chills and brought tears to my eyes. As well, the included footage of Diana's brother's actual speech was incredibly emotional. The Queen finally speaks publicly but I am very curious as to how close this speech is to the real one and plan to google it as soon as I finish this review.

""The Queen"" is an extremely well-done, gripping, emotional and thought-provoking film. Blair once again is portrayed very positively but one wonders what really transpired during those weeks since many of the conversations between Blair and the Queen would have been private. It's also interesting to note that no real footage of the royal family where they can be seen is included.

To me, a sign of a good movie is when you are left wanting to know more about the events depicted in it. And that is how I felt at the end.",1301097600,3,2289,4.922279792746114

Tony Blair comes across as being in touch with the public mood and it is a good reminder of how he was when he started out and before the power corrupted! A few characters don't come across too well (Cherie Blair and Prince Phillip), but you tend to relate to the Queen by the end of the film and understand a little more how she was brought up in a different time and felt unable to connect with the country when they looked to her for a degree of leadership. All the parts are acted well and I found the film length to be perfect, with enough info and story before it became overlong and boring.

 The story forwards to the tragic night of August 30, 1997 in Paris when Princess Diana was in a fatal car accident.
  From then on, it becomes a matter of The Queen carrying out her duties in the upmost proper way, the only way she knows how, verses, Prime Minister Tony Blair's suggestions according to what he has read in the tabloids and he feels what the British people want. The Queen is more concerned about protecting Prince William and Prince Henry during this time of mourning and grief, but publicly the Queen is being accused of not showing any remorse or making any public statement at all about the unexpected death of her grandchildren's mother, Lady Diana, who according to the Royal Family is no longer a member of Royalty since her divorce from Prince Charles in 1996.

  Also in the cast: James Cromwell, Sylvia Sims, Alex Jennings, Roger Allam.

  Archive Footage of: Princess Diana, Dodi Fayed, Earl Charles Spencer, Elton John, Tom Hanks, Nelson Mandela, Henry Kissinger Camilla Parker-Bowles, Luciano Pavarotti, Steven Spielberg, Tracey Ullman and many more.

  Helen Mirren portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II is brilliant. It is as if you are watching the Queen. Now that is good acting. Helen Mirren was totally absored in the role. Just the slightest facial expression or movement of her elbow adds to the performance.

  Helen Mirren won the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Mirren is surely at the height of her craft as she conveys a wealth of emotion with just a look of the eye or the slightest movement of her hand. Just taken on face value alone this movie is an intriguing peek behind the curtains of the British royal household. This movie, however, delivers much more than just an historical re-telling of a modern event that will certainly become legend in centuries to come.

Behind the obvious storyline of both the royal and governmental reaction to the outpouring of public grief over Princess Diana's death is a subtler look at the role of royalty in modern life. Are the people supposed to serve the Queen, or is the Queen there to serve the people? If the monarchy supplies stability and tradition, should it also adapt to modern times?

1560543,5,B00005JPAM,"""The Queen"" (2006) is a wonderful, fascinating movie with a great script, superior cinematography, and great acting by Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and by Michael Sheen as a toothy Tony Blair. It's all about the death of Prince Diana, the royals' reaction and behavior after her death and the way the public in an outpouring of grief turned their wrath against the royal family believing them to be indifferent to her death.
Looking back, the paroxysms of grief that were displayed by the public now seem excessive. Viewing the movie now, I think viewers may be slightly more sympathetic toward the Queen.
The movie portrays the royal family with Prince Philip, Elizabeth's husband (expertly played by actor James Cromwell) as a mean-spirited and nasty man who always has to put his oar in. The Queen Mum (in a brilliant piece of casting played by Sylvia Syms) is cold-hearted. Prince Charles is ineffectual, weak, and bungling. The Queen shows her disdain for him and has some nasty cracks to make about her playgirl sister Margaret.
All of this, of course, involves guesswork and supposition by the screenwriter since few were privy to what went on in the royal establishment. When Diana died, the royals were ensconced in Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Callous Prince Philip took the boys (Prince William and Hall, not portrayed in the movie) out hunting for a stag during the mourning period.
The Queen and royals remained in Balmoral while the public seethed. The movie shows the newly elected Blair benefiting from the furor and shows him imploring the Queen to show some consideration for her subjects who wanted her to be almost mourner-in-chief. Finally Blair convinces the Queen that the media is after her head, and the public is turning against the monarchy.
Through all of this Helen Mirren does a masterful job of making the Queen a flawed but real and human person.
Newsreel footage is used with great skill. It's an engrossing look at the royals. Elizabeth drives herself around the huge Balmoral estate, and she sees a beautiful stag. The symbolism of the stag is not completely clear, whether it shows Elizabeth's reaction to her predicament, whether it's Diana, or whether it shows that she values animals above human beings.",1265500800,,2248,4.949735449735449
1560544,5,B00005JPAM,This is an enlightening film that is both informative and elegantly presented.  It is an inside look at a tradition that has for many years been dominated by men.

1560545,5,B00005JPAM,"Shortly after the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) to the position of Prime Minister, Princess Diana was killed in a horrific car accident. As the British public clamors for an open memorial for the woman Prime Minister Blair called ""The People's Princess"", Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) chooses to keep everything private, taking her grandsons to Balmoral Castle to help them in their time of loss. Without any word from the royal family though, the British people become angered, and are soon close to calling for the dissolution of the crown.

Princess Diana's death was a very tragic event that led to a sense of lost amongst people the world over. It's no secret that Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Di did not get along, especially when considering the fact that Diana was not quiet about her former husband's, Prince Charles, infidelity among other things and was dating a Muslim. Shortly before Diana's death, Tony Blair was elected to the position of Prime Minister, and while things looked somewhat smooth, no one could have expected the hardships he was about to go through in dealing with what became something of a national crisis. Depicting a situation like this isn't an easy task for film, so how did Stephen Frears do with his movie The Queen?

Amazingly! With a script written by Peter Morgan (Frost/ Nixon, The Damned United, The Last King of Scotland, etc.) which is actually the second in something of a series starring Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, The Queen is not only a look at the inner workings of the British government in a time of crisis, but is also a look at the differences between the branches of government and the way they think. Throughout the movie you see that the Queen and the royal family are very old school, choosing to hide emotion and mourn in private rather than display their feelings to the world. They also don't believe that Diana should be mourned on a public level since she no longer was a member of the royal family. Then you have Tony Blair who wants to move the government in a new direction, and can't believe the way the royal family is handling this: with a lack of warmth in their proceedings. You see Blair trying his best to do what he can for a family that, from the outside, doesn't appear to want to do anything for itself. Working off interviews from unnamed sources within the queen's employ and staffers who worked with Blair, Morgan crafts a script that catches the nuances of the inner workings of the government in this type of situation.

To really bring this out, you really need great acting, and in Michael Sheen as Tony Blair and Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II you completely see the struggles, differences, and even similarities between these two figures. As Queen Elizabeth II, Helen Mirren shows you a woman who is strong and solid in her ways but also worries about her position in the history of the monarchy. Mirren's performance is truly the tour de force of the film, but one also can't count out Michael Sheen's portrayal of Prime Minister Blair. You see Blair as a man trying to lead Britain into a new era, and sees things differently with the monarchy, but still holds the monarchy in high regard. As the people start to turn on the monarchy you see him as a man who is, not trying to tell the monarchy what to do, but trying to help the monarchy through a crisis into a better position in the court of public opinion, and Sheen masterfully embodies this.

Never does the movie take a position as to whether the monarchy is good or bad, outdated or what Britain needs at this time. It doesn't examine Princess Diana's life, or who was at fault in her death. A masterful feat for the director, the movie really just examines the monarchy and the British government in this day and age through this crisis. On top of that, the eye for attention to detail is amazing. You see the difference between the settings where the monarch lives and the lower levels of the government reside, and the images of the country side at Balmoral Castle, and the views of the castle interior are breathtaking. Accomplishing this kind of movie in this day and age is a great achievement.

If you're a fan of films dealing with history, or the inner workings of government, particularly the British government I highly recommend this film. With superb acting, directing, and writing this film shows what any film dealing in this nature of material should really be like.

1560596,5,B00005JPAM,"The Queen has been raised to believe in absolute values.  But she lives in a dark age of consumerist, media mediated shallowness.  When her people desert her for the false image of a demented daughter-in-law, she must choose between what she has been taught is ""true"" and what the marketing people tell her she must ""be.""

This film suggests that identity in the modern age is a hoax.  We are all whores and we will kill everything we love (pay attention to the scene with the deer: the greatest moment in contemporary cinema) to stay in the spotlight.

This is the wittiest, most profound film of the 21st century.  Probably there has been no film since the days of ""Pygmalion"" in which the British cinema has come so close to besting Shakespeare.",1260403200,3,748,4.628787878787879
1560597,5,B00005JPAM,"This is another depressing, yet phenomenal film.

Very quickly, you really need to see this film with hindsight to appreciate it fully.

The film begins with Tony Blair's rise to power. And we can see that Tony's wife does not think much of the queen. (Her translation of the queen's words would probably not be allowed here!)

From here, we see Dianne's fatal accident, and while the queen acknowledges the tragedy, Prince Charles is the only one who feels that Dianne has to be treated with royal respect even though she is an X princess.)

The major plot of this movie is that the royal family has an unprecedented circumstance here. The death of an X princess who was popular. Add to that that Tony Blair is just settling in, and he knows that certain parties are wondering as to the usefulness of the monarchy. (So things are unstable.)

Without going on for too long, her majesty Queen Elizabeth II has legitimate reasons to dislike Dianne. And to complicate things further, she tries to gain control of the situation the way she has in the past. (Remaining unaffected.)

Prince Charles receives gentle treatment in this film. He seems to know 2 major things. (1) For the monarch to survive, it must be willing to be flexible with the times. (2) Even more important, unlike his mother, Charles is aware that the Dianne they knew is NOT the Dianne the majority of people knew.

While the movie is called ""The Queen,"" one could easily argue that the true star is Tony Blair. He's a competent young Prime Minister who agrees with progression, but he also has a respect for traditions as well as the monarchy. While his wife is anti monarchist, Tony knows that England has a need for the monarchy and they (for the most part) want the monarchy: ""Spare me the 'off with their heads' routine.""

At one point, Tony has to (with some regret) 'strong arm' the Queen to take required action about Dianne. Perhaps the most moving point in this film is when after doing this difficult action, Tony Blair faces down the hostile press and explains that Queen Elizabeth II never wanted this job, that she watched it kill her father King George VI, and that she did the job she never wanted with dignity and grace for almost 50 years.

Tony also reminds the 'wicked press' that Dianne: ""...threw everything the queen offered back in her face, and for the past few years dedicated her life 24/7 to destroying everything the queen held dear.""

Keeping this final and climactic speech of Tony Blair in mind, makes watching this film a 2nd time all the more interesting.

1560600,5,B00005JPAM,"""Nowadays, people want glamour and tears, the grand performance. I'm not very good at that. I never have been. I prefer to keep my feelings to myself.""  -- Queen Elizabeth II

Retaining the dignified privacy that's typical of England's royal family versus showing feelings to an upset and saddened British public that craves monarchial comfort and emotion -- those are the difficult options facing Queen Elizabeth II after Princess Diana's sudden death in this spellbinding movie starring Helen Mirren.

Following Diana's death, it's a clash of old-world thinking from the queen and her entourage, up against the newly elected Tony Blair, a ""modern"" and forward-thinking politician who hopes to revolutionize England. In Blair's corner are the people of Great Britain, who loved Diana and now scorn the queen's reluctance to display remorse after the princess' untimely death. In a world filled with 24-hour news cycles and wear-your-heart-on-your-sleeve reality TV shows, the public desires an appearance from Queen Elizabeth II to put a stamp on memorializing the ""people's princess.""

But the queen has a mindset and a long history of her own, not all of it regal, and she isn't easily pigeonholed. A former mechanic in World War II and a lover of the outdoors and dogs, Queen Elizabeth II defies convenient stereotype. Though initially her airs reek of snobbishness, Elizabeth is actually a down-to-earth, razor-sharp gal who's filled with the same range of humanity that all of us possess and truly loves and believes in her country. Observing her interaction with people and during personal moments is fascinating and hearkens back to a bygone era that valued familial privacy, honor, restraint and proper decorum.

Nuance abounds from Blair as his relationship with the queen evolves and he begins to view her less as an archaic figurehead and more as a noble leader who in many ways can't help her mentality and circumstances. Blair, who starts his term as prime minister a bit in awe of the queen's presence, delicately begins to open up and make suggestions to assist with her predicament of holding on to private family grief versus showing her face to the people of England. Ultimately, though there are some critical words along the way, both the increasingly confident Blair and the staid, honorable queen show themselves to be compromising leaders who only want to do what's right for their country.

This glimpse into privileged worlds is made even better by stellar acting by everyone involved. Michael Sheen is practically a carbon copy of the real Tony Blair; Mirren won an Academy Award for her performance as Queen Elizabeth II; and everyone else, from the boorish James Crommwell (the Queen's husband) to the stately Roger Allam (the Queen's adviser) to the brusquely opinionated Helen McCrory (Blair's wife), were spectacular in their roles.",1246060800,,2864,5.161637931034483
1560601,4,B00005JPAM,"This film depicts the feeling of ambiguity that was generated around the hysterical mourning for Diana Spencer. It also suggests, correctly,in a powerful way, that the impact that public opinion had which forced the Royal's response, the demand for a public display of emotion, had a fundamentally debilitating effect on people's views of the Monarchy. That the Queen actually gave the public address as her own decision, rather than from the advice of Tony Blair (as suggested in the film), would be more consistent with reality then this film. Of course the Prime Minister would never offer such advice nor would the correspondence between the Queen and the Prime Minister ever be divulged. Firstly, such a suggestion would pressure the Queen to be political, and secondly, no correspondence between a monarch and a Prime Minister concerning a fundamental issue of constitutional duty would be divulged because it would violate state protocol (its something for historians 200 years from now to read about).  I lived next to Hyde Park in a University of London hall of residence when the events this film  depicted actually took place, there were plenty of people who went to the park because they were mystified by the outpouring of emotion.  What this film does show very bluntly is how the population forced a change in Royal protocol.  The flying of the flag at half-mast, the intermixing between the crowd and the Queen. In the scene depicting the intermixing there is a sound over from a TV news broadcast saying that this hadn't happened since the celebration of the end of the second world war. That suddenly said it all for us who were there but skeptical.  This nothing of a woman, Diana, that everyone had read feelings and emotion into, forced the Monarch to do something that hadn't been done since the end of WW2, and then in celebration.  Well, I guess the death of Diana was exactly the same as a war that killed 50 odd million people, wasn't it? I guess flying the flag at half mast was correct after its role for centuries had been simply to denote the presence of the Monarch. What is implied in this movie is exactly what has happened in Britain since the Diana event: the monarchy, the constitutional symbol of Britain, has diminished in significance in people's minds and people have forgotten about Diana.  The Queen's instincts to remain aloof were correct. Her action, forced on her by a mob of morons who were boobyed by Diana's death, has helped undermine the British sense of self. In these days of economic problems, the Queen is no longer someone beyond politics and  worldliness to look to for comforting support. Was it worth it?",1245110400,2,2663,4.837362637362637

1560603,5,B00005JPAM,"The movie was excellent... even for those of us who did not care for the way the Royal family treated Princess Di. Helen Mirren gave an Oscar winning, tasteful, believable performance. I also think the part of Philip was right on the nose. His malice and narrow minded, out of touch arrogance was perfectly portrayed in this movie. It was nice to see that his personality was not soft-soaped.

The writing and portrayal of Tony Blair was very compelling. It seemed like most of the movie was angled from either his point of view or that of his advisers. The only problem I had with the acting on Blair's character was that the acting was a bit overdone like he was some wide eyed kid on his very first solo visit to a candy store.

The hair wasn't quite right on Blair or Charles. It would have helped the feel of the movie if the hairdressers and makeup had done as good a job on them as they did on Helen Mirren for the role of the Queen. It would not have required much effort to comb their hair more like the persons they were portraying.

The writers did well on all characters except Prince Charles. They didn't give the actor much to work with on lines. The writing fell flat on that character... even for Charles who's already a flat personality to begin with.

Otherwise, it was a superb job of acting and writing.

However, the director, Stephen Frears is an unkempt, ill-mannered, lowbrow slob in serious need of lessons in hygiene. He looks like some boozer from skid row. From his disheveled appearance, attitude, commentary and lack of personal hygiene, it is obvious that the actors and the writing team were the ones who made this movie so successful... not the director.

It amazes me that anyone would hire this director, much less pay him a salary. All you need to do is watch the bonus material to see and hear what a swine this man is (on or off the set)... not to mention his bad manners, bad on-camera etiquette and slovenly appearance to go with his tasteless attitude. He didn't even have the decency to clean up for the DVD interview. On top of that he was frequently scratching and messing with his hair and face while on camera. He is the closest match to a human version of Homer Simpson I have ever seen. He spoke of someone looking like a clown... he should have looked in the mirror.

Another person who had no business working on this particular film was Alan MacDonald, the production designer. He had the unmitigated audacity to declare on the bonus material interview, that the 4 billion people worldwide who were mourning Diana were all hysterical. He said it with such utter disdain and condescending attitude toward the billions of people... it was wholly offensive.

Apparently, math and human compassion are not his forte... otherwise he would have realized that the person with the psychological shortcomings was himself... not the rest of the world. He made no contribution to this film that could not have been better done by any other production designer. Frankly, I would think twice about buying any future movie which either of these men are associated with. Their very presence spoils anything they are associated with. They would both be more at home in the low end of the adult film industry.

But don't let that dissuade you on the film. The acting and writing more than made up for the shortcomings of the director and production designer.",1240790400,,3392,4.621262458471761

This movie actually works very well and I found myself cheering for the old gal.  The rather recent history was also a big plus as I suspect most of us find ourselves being drawn back into the shocking event of Princess Di's untimely death.  I'm sure that there were plenty of people like myself who never really followed the Princess yet were drawn into the communal sadness that followed her fatal accident.  I recall the British uproar over the lack of any emotional expression from Queen Elizabeth II and, admittedly, her inaction seemed pretty cold at the time.  I actually feel better now about her and a lot of other things.  I was engrossed in the portrayal of the official yet caring relationship that the new PM Tony Blair was developing with her majesty.  I'm sure much of this is creative but the frequent use of newsreel accounts seems to draw us into a sense of complete reality.

1560672,4,B00005JPAM,"This 2006 film tells the story of those dark days in 1997 when Princess Diana was tragically killed in a car crash and the world mourned the loss.  Queen Elizabeth, however, did not react immediately.  Because of the scandal surrounding the Princess's divorce from Prince Charles, royal protocol ruled, and there was a conspicuous silence from Buckingham Palace.

In the role that won her the Academy Award, Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth seems absolutely real. Something magical happens and she actually ""becomes"" her royal highness herself.  It's not just that she looks like her; it's much more than that.  She has mastered the accent, the nuances, and the fleeting emotion in a self-controlled countenance.  She is also humbled and confused but this only comes through in fleeting moments of personal soul searching.  Otherwise, she embodies proper behavior as befits the tradition of the monarchy.

Michael Sheen is cast in the role of Prime Minister Tony Blair and the early scenes depict his awkwardness in the presence of the Queen of England.  As the story progresses, however, he actually helps her to understand that the world has changed in the fifty years since she was crowned. This is all done very subtlety and I couldn't help be moved by the Queen's personal turmoil.

There were strengths in the screenplay and but there were also weaknesses.  A lot of the story was told through newsreels that we have all seen over and over again.  Also, we know how it all played out.  And so I found myself a bit impatient at the slow pace.

The story is this: Here, we have an intimate glimpse of Queen Elizabeth II (as well as her husband, the Queen Mother, and Prince Charles) during the window of time just before and during the week or so period of time after Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. The focal point of the movie is the hostile reaction of the British people toward the Queen's cold attitude in regard to Diana's death.

I need to say up front that I'm a fan neither of The Royals nor of the late Princess -- but I AM interested in hearing all about their endless peccadilloes. In fact, this actuality was one of my disappointments because I thought that this film was about the Queen's entire reign, and it's not. Still, I can't rightfully criticise what the film is NOT about... I just wish that the title had been more explicit.

In any case, right away the Queen and the Windsor-Mountbatten family are portrayed as pretty heartless and rotten, at least by American standards. Following the death of Diana, Prince Charles is also served up to us as a spineless flip-flopper and a witless wimp... okay so far.

At that point, newly-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair begins advising and urging the Queen to relent on her silence and isolation and share in the grief of the British people over Diane's death, a pill that the old sourpuss finds almost impossible to swallow. Still okay so far.

Then, at a turning point in the movie, the producers elect to REDEEM the Queen, just because she came out and sniffed the flowers under extreme political pressure and duress. There was not the first bit of actual remorse in that woman's heart (neither in the film nor in reality!) So, WHY did the film-makers decide to attempt to make her look like a normal human being? I surely have not figured it out!

So, in summary, I found this movie to be manipulative, although I must assert that this device was completely lost on me. I hold the Queen in no higher esteem now (post-film) than I did when she was acting like a witch the day after Diana died, (or even before that.)

As far as the cinematography and the continuity of the film, it was superb. The Producers also shrewdly used some actual footage of Diana and others which was sprinkled throughout the movie. There's a lot of nice scenery in this flick and some really terrific acting. Overall, I was okay on watching this film all the way through but I would not watch it again. With some trepidation, I would slightly recommend it to others.",1224806400,2,2660,4.54070981210856
1560674,5,B00005JPAM,The Queen is one of the most provocative films of the Royal Family that I've seen in years. It tells the story from the side of the Royal Family during a time of crisis and change in the UK. It was insightful to the problems that the Queen had during this time. The decisions that she had to make were not only stressful but went against the grain of the tradition that she held so dear and also against the era that she grew up in. It also showed that the people as well as Tony Blair knew that the country needed a change. Tony Blair was pivotal in keeping the Queen's image intact. Helen Mirren did an excellent job in portraying Queen Elizabeth II in this remarkable movie. She definitely brought her to life in this film and gave viewers a chance to see that the Queen is genuinely human.,1224288000,,793,4.258278145695364
1560675,5,B00005JPAM,"As a Yank from across the pond, I only recently caught THE QUEEN and I'm disappointed I didn't see it sooner!

This is one of those great films based on true incidents that constantly leaves you wondering, ""Did that really happen?""

The movie follows what happens following the death of Princess Diana, skillfully showing how the Royals, the new British government, and the media/public respond to the tragedy.  Actual news footage and interviews with Diana only make it seem more real, as well as the characterizations of everyone on the screen.

Some come off worse, others better.  I don't know.  Whatever the reality of what took place was, this is a very well-crafted, very compelling story.  I've always loved Helen Mirren.  She was a total Shakespeare babe in the 1970s (I saw some recent paparazzi shots of her in a bikini and she's still got it!), she's been great in everything I've seen her, and I'm thrilled she won the Oscar for THE QUEEN.

One last note: as bad as the Royals come off in some scenes, especially Prince Philip railing about Diana and outraged that ""homosexuals will be singing in Westminster"" (Elton John's #1 song), I wondered if the British press was getting a bit of a pass: whenever I saw online papers from England, they were aghast and appalled at Diana's activities right up until she died (chased by the press, no less).  Diana found ways of using the press herself--sunbathing in bikinis whenever Charles accompanied Camilla Parker-Bowles out on the town--but I thought they were terrible to her otherwise.",1222128000,2,1545,4.862595419847328

1560755,5,B00005JPAM,"The actors really look the parts in this insider's fantasy about what it must be like to be queen. The film really focuses on the week Diana died, and what happened behind the scenes. It's speculation, but we do know the Royals didn't want to acknowledge the death until forced by public opinion. If this is what it's like to be royal, I'll take it. Really top quality.",1220486400,,369,4.4411764705882355
1560756,5,B00005JPAM,"This is the one of the best movies I've ever seen. While most viewers already know the story pretty well, the superb acting makes it all seem new. Helen Mirren has  Queen Elizabeth down to perfection. It's surreal how good she is in this part. The one negative for me is the portrayal of the ""Queen Mother"". This doesn't seem quite right from the public image she always presented.",1218672000,,381,4.521739130434782

Great movie and beautiful scenery..

1560758,5,B00005JPAM,"That's my favorite line in the film, from a wickedly funny exchange between the Queen and her son Prince Charles. She says it to her beloved dogs when she abruptly decides to go for a walk and leave the Prince to drive off in a huff to a stag hunt after he exasperates her with his wimpish apprehension of getting shot at. One of my favorite scenes in an excellent film.  Helen Mirren deserved her Oscar for Best Actress.  Her portrayal of QEII is spot on.  A marvel how much she resembles the Queen in appearance!  I've seen this movie several times and it gets better every time. Michael Sheen's Tony Blair is also quite excellent.  All the actors are top-notch in their roles.  The movie's take of the royal family's behind-the-scenes machinations when Diana died is believable. That's what lends it an almost documentary feel throughout.  Highly recommended.",1212710400,,862,4.74496644295302
1560759,4,B00005JPAM,"Under the careful, intelligent direction of Stephen Frears, the great Helen Mirren captures and displays with amazing clarity the essence of Queen Elizabeth II's quandary during the wrenching summer of 1997, immediately following the death of Princess Diana, who famously died in a car crash in Paris while being chased by papparazi.  Ruminating over the palace's appropriate public response to the death of the ex-communicated princess, the Queen is caught between the ever-growing clamor for an official acknowledgement of Diana's passing and what she and nearly all her consorts (except for Tony Blair, who has just been elected Prime Minister) consider a near-vulgar display of public grief (i.e., her own stiff-upper-lip resolve to act on her own terms).

In the movie's most stunning scene, the Queen proceeds through the throngs that have gathered at Buckingham palace and is confronted by a child who offers a bouquet, insisting that the flowers are meant for the Queen.  Having expressed more remorse for the demise of a stag than for her former daughter-in-law, Elizabeth is surprisingly touched by this simple gesture and it reveals her humanity, however circumspect, without ever betraying the steely contenance of a long-reigning monarch.  It's also testament to the power of Mirren's daring and brilliantly nuanced performance.  ""The Queen"" also features the legendary Sylvia Sims as the Queen Mother, Micheal Sheen, who effectively approximates Tony Blair and the charming Helen McCrory as a spunky, devastatingly funny Cherie Blair--an independent, thoroughly modern and successful career woman who disdains antiquated ""royal"" formalities.  Also notable is James Cromwell as the crotchety Prince Phillip.",1212105600,2,1720,5.57088122605364
1560760,5,B00005JPAM,"I was only an child in the 3rd grade when Princess Diana Died.. I later grew up to find out how much of an wonderful spirit and beautiful person she was.. In the news, I would hear how the tabloids and the royal family would speak about Diana. When I saw ""THE QUEEN"", it opened my eyes even more for me to realize how much the royal family would degrade her in such a disrespectful way but, it also shows the tenderness of HER MAJESTY has for the boys. This is a really good movie but also a short movie...",1210118400,,506,4.07
1560761,4,B00005JPAM,"To confront the Queen of England, Tony Blair and the death of Lady Diana, the Princess of Wales, was dramatic at the time but has totally aged today. And the film has aged to. This big vignette, this enormous cameo in normal life that this week after the tragic end of a young woman was has become quaint, charmingly quaint but with little meaning left.

During that week, or even that summer, the monarchy nearly fell in England but the Queen, though surrounded by too many people who were deaf and blind, managed to hear the piece of advice given to her by Tony Blair and she followed it and saved that monarchy. Is that what happened or not?

That is not the problem. It is reassuring to believe it is what happened. But it is also important to understand that in today's world what counts is public opinion. We may think public opinion is looking for emotional and sentimental empathy instead of real deep inner grief. But this public opinion remains the yardstick with which we are to measure and determine our behavior.

Apparently Stephen Frears wants to make us believe that Elizabeth II did feel and understand the necessity to accept that rule. Something of the kind surely happened.

Yet the film is in no way transcendingly immortal. The best part remains Helen Mirren who is embodying a Queen that is superbly heart raking and soul moving.

1560762,5,B00005JPAM,"A brief summary would be that this film is about QE2's relationship with Tony Blair and her action (and inaction) the week after Diana's death in '97. My cousin Marcy is a huge Diana freak and won't see it because of the views. I found the film adaptation of history interesting, and there really was a blurred line between what actually happened and what didn't happen. It was meshed together from what happened publically, interviews with some people (publically and off the record), and fictional creative license.

This was one of the best movies of the year. I honestly don't think it will win Best Picture (it is nominated) because the entire thing wasn't great. For example, the cinematography bothered us from time to time. The guy who played Tony Blair was well done, and he, uncanningly, looked like him. I liked the juxtaposition between his family and the royal family. Now onto Helen Mirren. Anyone who votes against her for the Best Actress award is a fool. She's a shoo-in. She will win. I said it here first. Helen Mirren BECAME QE2 in this film. Sometimes I watch actors or actresses and think ""Damn, so and so is doing a job playing so and so"" but it wasn't like that for me here. When Mirren was out driving around and being herself as the vulnerable woman who never wanted to be Queen, this was when she was her best.

1560763,5,B00005JPAM,"The film basically focuses in two well decisive moments in England, 1997. The first was the election of Tony Blair, May 2 1997 and his first formal contact with The queen; and then the tragic and fatidic August 30th , 1997 in which Diane Princess left us.

The basic dilemma between tradition and modernism ; to face the British people and join with them in a common grief , through behind-stage bitter opinions among the members of the Real Family are contrasted with the discrete with the pragmatism of Blair, who despite his youth, knew to perceive the social atmosphere and the public opinion.

On the other hand, we realize how the media influenced day by day the political behavior, that feed back to Blair to make daily advises to his Majesty to change her mind.

Through an unerring camera work, Stephen Frears built a convincing, absorbing and full rounded movie, with the superb performance of Helen Mirren, one of the national artistic patrimonies of U.K.

I came away feeling pity for Elizabeth II in her position although she is far better off in the world than I am.  It portrayed a difference in personal freedoms, and as someone once told me with knowledge comes responsibility.

I have only been aquainted with Mirren's movies in the past two years.  I think she is superb as the Queen, she nailed this one all the way.  She had me convinced she really was the Queen and I must mention Cromwell.  I have been watching this man for a lot of years and he is such a gifted actor.  It is pure pleasure watching him on the screen.  His roles always seem perfectly suited to him.  Excellent.",1206144000,,760,4.295774647887324

I remember clearly the day the news came across about Diana's death.  The follow-up global media coverage was impossible to ignore, thus I also followed that, though I don't remember much about the controversy surrounding the lack of a public position or statement from Buckingham Palace.  It was interesting to watch in this movie what was conceivably the private position taken by the British Royal Family regarding Diana's death, and, indeed, her life.  It all seemed very plausible.",1204675200,,713,5.051282051282051
1560884,4,B00005JPAM,"I was very impressed with the handling of this rather sensitive subject and felt that Helen Mirren did a wonderful acting job.
The queen was brought up from a young girl to keep her feelings hidden and it was refreshing to see her finally show her true feelings and for people to realize she is a human being and how much she cares.
It's not a glossed over version of the Royal Family, their strengths as well as their weaknesses are shown.  They are very privileged but still have similar family problems as ordinary people.

1560885,5,B00005JPAM,"Let me say at the outset that I know nothing of and have no technical observations about Blue-Ray vs HD/DVD blah, blah, blah..(hey, I didn't even see this at the movies...I saw it on TV!!)

I do, however, know that Helen Mirren ranks right up there with the best of'em i.e., Bette, Maggie, Judi, Vanessa, etc.  I have been a die-hard fan of Ms Mirren since the creation of Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennyson in ""Prime Suspect.""  The range of this actress is quite simply incredible.  She can do no wrong and here she is simply superb.

As ""The Queen"" Helen indeed fleshes out a royal most of the world knows very little about and therefore has made all sorts of unfounded assumptions about as well.  This also takes place during a very taxing time in anyone's life, much less a family so public as this.  Hellen manages to make Queen Elizabeth quite human, trying in the midst of the turmoil surrounding the death of Princess Diana to deal with the situation as best as she knows how.  She reacts like a woman who has pledged her life to her country first, then as a mother, and then as a grandmother.  Her impatience with Princess Diana recounts any mother-in-law's impatience with her ex-daughter-in-law; the added variable of this being the royal family of England makes it all the more complicated.  Before seeing this, I, like I imagine a lot of us, also thought the Queen was entirely too disconnected.  But things are not always as they seem.  Of course some of the Queen's actions are questionable and maybe some of her behavior may not be excused, but at least this presentation endeavors to at least submit motives behind those actions.

The film moves quickly, is actually quite witty, the writing is top-notch with Helen's performance, of course, being the driving force.  A most poignant scene is her reaction to seeing the elk?, deer"", (whatever) in the woods before it is eventually hunted down for sport.  It is a classic example of stopping to smell the roses in the midst of a most intense human drama.

To say I highly recommend is a masterpiece of understatment.  Excellent movie!",1203638400,,2105,4.692098092643052
1560886,4,B00005JPAM,"This movie did a good job of showing how the public eye sees reality and how that reality could be seen from the eyes of those in the public.  This gives a dramatic review of how the events around the Death of Diana could have unfolded.  The acting was done quite well and it was easy to move into this reality for a bit.  You even felt compassion for the Royal family and for the difficult situation that the Prime Minister was in.  In the end, it was a good movie for expanding the understanding of what happened from another perspective.",1203292800,,540,4.316831683168317

1560888,5,B00005JPAM,"This is an excellent, highly entertaining film. It has a smartly written script that is humorous and never lags; excellent sequencing and editing to keep the viewer fully engaged; exceptional acting from Helen Mirren, James Cromwell, and Michael Sheen; and an underlying theme of adaptive leadership that is superbly and seamlessly integrated into the narrative. It is the theme of adaptive leadership, exhibited first by Tony Blair and later by Queen Elisabeth, on which I would like to comment.

Everyone knows the story here of the tragic death of Princess Diana, the outpouring of public grief, and the failure of reaction on the part of the Windsors.  What is not as well known is the story behind the action where Tony Blair, the new Prime Minister, was able to gradually move Queen Elisabeth to comprehend the public mood and to respond to that mood appropriately. Both characters display the adaptive leadership and necessary flexibility to survive and move the public agenda forward. Blair fully grasps the situation as well as the need to apply just enough pressure to the Queen so that she grows and doesn't retreat.  Michael Sheen is super as Tony Blair, using intelligent charm and strategic wit to move the queen to recognition of the gravity of the issues and to take action by showing empathy with the grief of the English people. James Cromwell is excellent as Prince Phillip, sometimes playing the role of the Queen's alter-ego or id with his displays of disgust and indignation. At other times he reveals the isolated and insulated existence of the Windsors that separated them from normal existence. I would recommend this film to be viewed and analyzed in a class on adaptive leadership.",1202515200,9,1708,4.985964912280702

But I must admit that this was a super film. The insight that it affords into the workings of the royals, and people in general, the way they deal with things, their relationships with their own and others really fascinated me. It is such a different world, a different experience to anyone and anything else out there, yet in some ways I felt I could still connect with at least some of the characters on a human level. Additionally, it brought back some memories of that beautiful hot summer of '97.

1560984,5,B00005JPAM,"I still stand in amazement that Peter Morgan's ingenious and character-angst rich screenplay THE QUEEN did not win the 2007 Oscar. Sometimes I just sit back and sigh and say ""What the....."" when Awards are bestowed.

Revisiting THE QUEEN, now, after first seeing it in the theatres,I was struck with how utterly prophetic Peter Morgan's script so aptly directed by Stephen Frears is. Helen Mirren, unquestionably ""queenly"" in her inhabitation of Queen Elizabeth of England, prophetically proclaims to Tony Blair (after the whole Diana funeral had come to a close) how incredibly difficult and hurtful it was to her to see that 1 out of 4 Brits actually hated her during her indecision with protocol over Diana's death. Mirren advises quite soberly.""It will happen to you Mr. Blair...quite suddenly,without warning!"" Were ever more Royal expressions  more true.

The one genius of this script is that it not only attempts to humanize and demonize The Royals and the new Prime Minister,but it shows the inescapable political charade that all parties were forced to play in a moment's notice. Princess Diana has died. She is no longer a Royal. Tony Blair has just won a landslide victory for his Party,and Queen Elizabeth if forced to face 1000 years of Monarchical Protocol in the light of such sudden events,especially in the light of her disapproval of Diana AND the new Prime Minister.

What a travesty that this film was only recognized with one single Oscar-that of Helen Mirren,who rightfully deserved it. How many times have I heard, ""OH,the movie where Helen Mirren plays The Queen!"".But this film is so much more than the acting of Helen Mirren. Michael Sheen as Tony Blair is every bit as important in making this film work,and the Alexandre Desplats soundtrack and the adept direction of Stephen Frears made this SUCH a neat,tidy,seamless and ""positively practically English"" look at how world leaders deal with events.

Well. Mr. Blair IS gone from office...""quite suddenly, and without warning"" and The Queen STILL sits upon her throne. This film should be rewatched often and with great warning to those in high offices. The Queen eventually did what was right for the people,even though everything in her said ""NO"".Oh,Mr. Blair....why did you not heed your own advice?",1200441600,,2281,5.072

1560986,3,B00005JPAM,"As an American, I have never quite ""gotten"" the role that the British Monarchy plays in the government and life of Great Britain. This film went far towards explaining this, as the British establishment reeled after the death of Princess Diana. Tony Blair had just taken up his duties as Prime Minister when this tragedy struck. The nexus of this film is the struggle between Blair and the Queen concerning how the Monarchy should react to Diana's death. The British public demanded that the House of Windsor address the issue publicly, while the Queen implacably sought to keep out of the public eye during this turmoil. The Queen, at least according to this film, initially treated Blair with contempt, but eventually is forced to see that Blair correctly understood what the public demanded of the Monarchy. One interesting line in the film is where the Queen reflects that ""when a Queen loses touch with her subjects, maybe it is time for her to step aside in favor of a new generation..."" Now there is food for thought...

This film depicts the Queen as a dignified lady, steeped in tradition, who is nevertheless hopelessly out of touch with public opinion and suffering from not a little over-arrogance. Tony Blair forces her to see that the Monarchy, in the end, must serve the people and meet their expectations. In one scene she sits in depression, staring at a newspaper headline ""Queen Bends the Knee to Blair."" Yes, that about summed it up.

Helen Mirren absolutely nails the role of the Queen in this film, and Michael Sheen does very well as Tony Blair. All of the supporting actors do well. This is a quality film that successfully captures the turmoil that Diana's death caused for the British Establishment. It is also excellent entertainment.",1198886400,5,1761,4.847176079734219
1560987,4,B00005JPAM,"Good movies, like good books and music, should be viewed and heard many times, especially when the performance of one or more characters is remarkable.  I saw ""The Queen"" several times when it was released, and now I own the DVD, which I have also watched on many occasions.  What invariably happens is that we see a scene in a different light, we discern something that previously eluded us, or we radically change our perception of a character.  This suggests that the way we perceive all media is in constant flux, and that sometimes we are never quite certain about our judgments.

For me, the more that I have seen ""The Queen,"" the less I am troubled by her (and her mother's and husband's) obliviousness and apparently stubborn and anachronistic behavior.  In the first viewings, I remember agreeing with Michael Sheen (who plays Blair superbly):  ""Will someone please save these people from themselves?!.""

But after more viewings, I began to feel sorry for Elizabeth and viewed her as a victim of tradition, duty and the cloistered, myopic surroundings she lived in that seemed to cut her off from common sense and the changing, ""modern"" world (the word ""modern"" is a key concept in the film).  I began to feel compassion for her and felt that she was simply overwhelmed by events that she could not (rather than would not) comprehend.  (I think the movie attempts to engage our compassion, but in one instance it does so with an astonishingly inept and heavy-handed metaphor of Elizabeth compared to a noble stag at Balmoral that is relentlessly stalked and eventually killed.)  So, again, I agreed with Sheen:  ""That woman has given her whole life in service to her people.  Fifty years doing a job that she never wanted.  A job she watched kill her father.  She's executed it with honor, dignity, and as far as I can tell, without a single blemish, and now we're all baying for her blood.  All because she's struggling to lead the world in mourning for someone who threw everything she offered back in her face.  And who for the last few years, seemed committed 24/7 to destroying everything she holds most dear!""

Recently, I happened to see on YouTube Elizabeth's actual 1997 speech on television from Buckingham Palace and compared it with Helen Mirren's same speech in the movie.  And then I started to question my judgment about my compassion for Elizabeth.

That, I think, is the conflicting nature of this movie, and the remarkably layered performance that Mirren gives.  We may never discover what transpired during that historically important week, and moreover, which Elizabeth actually participated in those events.",1198886400,3,2637,4.896396396396397

1560989,5,B00005JPAM,"In 1997, the world received the shocking news of the sudden death of Princess Diana.  This fascinating movie examines the chasm that opened between Queen Elizabeth II and the British public when she underestimated their grief and failed to react to Diana's death in a manner that they deemed appropriate.  Caught between queen and subjects is newly elected prime minister Tony Blair (looking about 22 years old, and played to perfection by lookalike Michael Sheen).

When the news of Princess Diana's death in a car crash in Paris reaches England, the prime minister immediately contacts the press with a statement of grief.  The royal family, on the other hand, are vacationing in Scotland.  Not only do they display no reaction to Diana's death whatsoever, they do not even cut their holiday short and return to Buckingham Palace until they are good and ready.  Things continue to get tense as the British public gets no statement or reaction from the royals.  The grief-stricken British spontaneously bury the street outside Buckingham Palace in flowers for Diana.  The tabloids chronicle their growing animosity towards the queen.

Meanwhile, the Queen sits alone, watching video footage of Diana on television, analyzing Diana's every move with a brooding squint that speaks volumes.  She seems jealous, regretful, and deeply puzzled by the ""people's princess.""  Helen Mirren doesn't exactly look like Elizabeth, but she has her mannerisms, her accent, and her dowdy but impeccable wardrobe precisely nailed down.  Through Mirren's subtle but powerful performance, you become aware that the queen comes from a different, more stoic generation than did Diana.  Like Diana, the queen also served as a symbol of England and its heroic endurance during the Second World War.

Only the prime minister seems to understand the queen's side of things.  One of the great pleasures of the movie is seeing him mediate between the queen and her subjects, attempting to repair the growing rift.

Every great character study has an unforgettable scene:  the one in this movie is where Tony Blair after having been voted into office still must observe the tradition of going to see the queen and asking her to accept him as her prime minister.  He does this, and she - in a priceless exchange invoking the memory of Winston Churchill - puts him firmly in his place.  You've got to laugh, and marvel at both great performances.",1198800000,,2416,5.0708860759493675

1561080,4,B00005JPAM,"Hellen Mirren gives Queen Elizabeth such a regal human element that you can't help feeling for the Queen during what had to be a very trying time for the monarchy.  The movie focuses specifically on the days that followed Diana's death.  A surprisingly compact film that gives one a relatively intimate look at the royal family without delving too deeply into the emotions.  Prince Philip and the Queen Mother are presented as the most callous figures in this film, while Prince Charles agonizes over the impact Diana's death will have on the family, particularly ""the boys,"" which are seen only from the back and not mentioned by name.  Meanwhile, the Queen is torn between protocol and what appear to be her own emotions regarding Diana's death.

Your opinion of the monarchy after the tragedy of Diana won't be swayed much one way or the other by this movie as Stephen Frears plays it pretty close to the hip.  About the only thing new is the apparent feelings of Tony Blair in regard to the monarchy, doing his best to advise the royal family of the impact the death of Diana was having on the British people at the time, and getting them to come out of their sequestered Balmoral estate, where most of the action takes place.  Michael Sheen offers an uncanny performance as Blair, capturing his character to a tee.",1197244800,2,1319,4.683982683982684

The film covers a few short months in the lives of the Royal family beginning at the election of Tony Blair and ending two months after Diana's death.

The plot is slow moving. Don't expect action. Quiet moments of discussion between the Queen and different family or staff members fills the majority of the film.

Interspersed between newscast reports of the details of Diana's death are scenes of reaction and struggle as the Queen stretches to do the right thing -- even though it may not feel proper.

1561083,4,B00005JPAM,"Few books or films about a living monarch can avoid caricature. Royalty as a fact on the ground runs so contrary to the spirit of modernity--yet there they *are*!--and still holds such sentimental power for many 'subjects'. The result is the virtual impossibility of a civil discussion about gradated pros and cons.

Into this moral sloshing about strides Stephen Frears' THE QUEEN, a movie best remembered for the command performance (queens usually ask for such a thing rather than *giving* it) of Dame  Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II. Almost predictably, the film lurches into the tendency to create and caricature vilains: Cherie Blair and Prince Philip come of as genuine awfuls occupying opposite extremes of the ideological spectrum. Prince Charles and Alisdair Campbell are almost as bad.

One might argue that Fears did not *create* those villains, simply portrayed them within an acceptable range of their already existing awfulness. This is plausible. Most of us will never know because we will never know *them*.

Yet I find THE QUEEN a gripping film because of its superb narration of a dialogue-of-wary-respect between Blair and the Queen. Mrs Blair even accuses the young prime minister of 'going over' to the royals just as all Labour MPs have gone 'gaga' when given access to them.

A word of parenthesis: this American reviewer was living in England at the time of Diana's death, the occasioning fact of this cinematic drama. My family and I had no particular opinion regarding Diana and certainly did not revere her. Yet we found ourselves caught up in the astonishing emotional outpouring that gripped Great Britain and to some extent the wider world in the week following her death. Something happened outside a Paris tunnel that week that none of us would have anticipated and that few understand to this day.

It is easy for me to imagine that Blair's conversations with the Queen were just about as Fears depicts them and that this *was* one of those positive outcomes that occasionally ensue when two people of strong character invade each other's company because of circumstances that neither one would have chosen.

I find the physical, visual portrayal of Blair unconvincing, though this is hardly fatal to the movie's success. Helen Mirren as the Queen, on the other hand, seems almost eerily true to fact.

This flawed but ultimately stirring movie is worth owning and returning to from time to time as distance readjusts the lens on a memory that remains unshakably present for those of us who lived through the events at close hand.",1196467200,,2568,4.9976580796252925

Examples included ""Elizabeth"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Braveheart"", and now ""The Queen"".  The last takes place in the present, the 1990's specifically, and chronicles the personal experience of the royal family after the death of Diana.  The story is told from multiple points of view, with the Queen and Tony Blair being the two main protagonists.  He is in touch with the British people; she is not.  She is in touch with England's past, they are not.  She feels the best way to get past Diana's death is in private; the public want a public ceremony.  So opposites collide and as a sign of a modern country, the monarch gives way to the people's will.  As an American, I found this to be quite an insightful movie, in that it very realistically portrays how a real person in power relates to the masses as part of a real historical event.  Few movies exist that do the same for American leaders; the last great one was probably ""Nixon"" by Oliver Stone.

1561087,4,B00005JPAM,"This movie puts us in Queen Elizabeth's shoes. It shows us the burdens of royal office from her point of view. So it provides an unusual perspective - an alternative to simply gawking at royalty from outside their gates.

Helen Mirren brings wonderful gravitas to her role, mixing it with the homely English capacity to push through. She's someone who reigns on the one hand, and who serves her family picnic salad and investigates how to jack her car out of the mud on the other hand. (I didn't even know that the Monarch drives her own car a lot of the time.)

There are several commentaries on the DVD. I found the director/writer commentary a little dry, with a sort of unpleasant testiness in the exchange between the two. Robert Lacey's commentary is a bit livelier, so if you only have time to listen to one commentary, I suggest you make it Lacey's account of the history behind some of the royal protocol.

Then if you would like to consider the role of monarchy a little further, I suggest you check out the ""The Swan,"" a film starring Alec Guinness and Grace Kelly. This is perhaps Grace Kelly's most overlooked film, but possibly her best. The movie is based on Hungarian writer Ferenc Molnar's famous work. It features a brilliant closing speech by Guinness, arguing that a Queen's duty is to glide alone and serene away from all popular pastime and indulgence.

Since Princess Di came on the scene, everyone automatically cast her as - the rose - the swan. However, this Helen Mirren movie makes a good case that Elizabeth II, purse and pumps and all, has nevertheless these last 50 years, kept faith as the swan.",1193616000,2,1627,4.619377162629758
1561088,4,B00005JPAM,"Going into `The Queen' I wasn't really expecting much at all.  My parents had seen the film and disliked it greatly sighting that it was boring and slow moving and nothing like they had expected.  Now I am never the one to follow my parent's advice, especially when it comes to entertainment, but there was something about this movie that screamed `TV Movie' to me and so I just didn't expect to like it much at all.  My wife wanted to see it though and so I conceded, and I must admit that since I love everything Oscar and feel this incessant need to embrace all that they embrace, at least so I can form an opinion, I wasn't hesitant about sitting down to watch the film.

What I found though was a brilliantly crafted biopic that held my interest and proved to be highly entertaining.

The film follows the days preceding the untimely death of Princess Diana and the media coverage of the Royal families reaction, or lack there of.  Young Tony Blair had just been elected Prime Minister before the tragedy and thus finds himself dealing with some very touchy issues very early on in his career.  The film does a fair job of trying to flesh out the motives of the royal family, especially those of the Queen herself, trying to make her appear real to the audience and maybe explain her strange behavior following the death of Princess Diana.

This fleshing out of the Queen is due to the amazing portrayal by Oscar winner Helen Mirren.  This was a very challenging role even though it won't appear that way.  When watching Mirren converse and interact on the screen you will see no hysterics, no outburst of emotion, nothing that screams Oscar.  What you will see is a woman dealing with the situation that lay before her, the people in her life telling her one thing and another as well as her own thoughts and feelings on the matter.  What you will see is the buried emotion that hides behind her eyes as she takes in everything but never divulges a single emotion.  This my friends is very hard to do.  Hysterics and outbursts may be difficult to tame and make believable but completely reserved emotion is just as hard to accomplish.  Helen Mirren soars in this regard.

The rest of the cast hold there own as well, especially Michael Sheen who portrays Tony Blair as both thoughtful and understanding.  Blair is probably the most well rounded character aside from the Queen herself here, the balance of the cast falling a bit into the background proving to be more or less accessories to the two main characters.  James Cromwell and Sylvia Syms do excellent work here as Prince Philip and the Queen Mother (was it just me or did they make Helen Mirren up to look OLDER than Syms who was playing her mother), both providing some explanation as to the Queens actions that given week.  Both Philip and Elizabeth are portrayed as very headstrong and somewhat tactless individuals whose contempt for Diana spilled over into their reaction to her death.  Prince Charles is portrayed rather sympathetically by Alex Jennings who seemed to capture the essence that was and is Charles beautifully.

Stephen Frears and Peter Morgan should be singled out though for helming the creation of this film.  Frears direction only magnifies the brilliance of Morgan's script that is both accurate (all biopics fail to be completely accurate, but in Hollywood terms this is quite good), witty, funny and engaging as well as educational for it helps the general public understand a little better a woman that not too many fully understand.  I won't deny the fact that, at times, `The Queen' does play out like a `TV Movie' for its production is not as polished as one might expect, but that in the end may be part of its appeal.  The lack of polish helps to keep the focus on the acting, which is miles above those found in `TV Movies'.

I am not one who believes Helen Mirren gave the best performance of the year or even of her five fellow nominees but now that I have witnessed her performance I can't say that I am upset with her win either.  She showed true strength and temperance with her delivery and was commanding without being showy.

`The Queen' is a movie I am glad to have seen and one that I will most likely see again for it proved to be much better than I had expected and delivered much more than I thought it could.  Is it in my top ten of the year?  No, but it is one of those `honorable mentions' that is worth just about everyone's time.",1193616000,2,4446,4.543287327478042
1561089,5,B00005JPAM,"I really enjoyed this film and found it better than I expected. Everyone knows Mirren was superb, but Sheen had Blair's voice to perfection and I thought all the actors did well, particularly the unsung heroes, four corgis of Her Majesty. Other reviews set the scene of unresponsive, out of touch queen versus the people's new prime minister. But I did not find this to be an anti-monarchist film at all. Blair is an instant convert to royalism it seems and the film faithfully portrays why the Queen behaved as she did. One does what one perceives to be one's duty and does not wear one's heart on one's sleeve. I confess all my sympathies were with the Queen in her distance from the gushing emotion and pseudo-grief of Joe Public. I think the story about the stag was to show the Queen had more feeling for dumb animals than a dead princess, but then the stag had not given her any distress in the past. I think the message portrayed was that it was not merely that the Queen did not show the emotion of grief over Diana but that she was not really feeling her loss, apart from her concern for the two boys. Of course one knows that a lot of what was portrayed here is mere speculation but the one historic thing I question is the congregation in Westminster Abbey applauding Althrop's speech. Did they? If so I must at the time have been so disgusted by his speech that I missed the applause. Thankfully the parts of his speech in which he criticized the royal family were left out. Message of the film.? The monarchy must modernise. Personally I am happier with the monarchy than with pseudo-emotion from the great British public.",1192838400,2,1635,4.508417508417509

I haven't watched this movie in one sitting. Too boring. This is one where you watch it in shifts, if I finish it at all.

1561172,5,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirren won an Academy Award for her performance as Elizabeth II in ""The Queen,"" which depicts the British monarch's reaction to the death of Princess Diana in the summer of 1997. Prime Minister Tony Blair (played brilliantly by Michael Sheen) had just recently been elected at the time of Diana's death, and he was still in the process of determining the best way to forge a successful working relationship with the queen. This film deals with Windsor's fall from grace the week after Diana's death, when the queen refused to follow the prime minister's advice on how to best handle the situation to meet the needs of the grieving British public.

At first the queen refuses to take Blair's advice about making any kind of public statement, preferring to remain silent in hopes that the former Princess of Wales would be laid to rest quickly and quietly, without any fanfare. However, the public's frustration grows and Elizabeth faces opposition from the government as well as from her son Charles (Alex Jennings). Soon it becomes clear that the royal family's inaction may wind up being their ultimate demise, and the queen is forced to come to terms with her own emotions and make one of what was surely many difficult choices during her reign.

I think this film is brilliant. The cast is absolute perfection, and it's very clear why Mirren received an Oscar for her portrayal as a queen struggling to come to terms with her own personal beliefs and the realization that she doesn't always understand the needs of her people. I also appreciated the way the film handled the treatment of Diana herself. Although the plot of the movie revolves around Diana's death, it's handled gracefully and with dignity. Instead of casting an actress to play the princess, the film relied on a steady peppering of news clips showing the real Diana herself, which was thoughtful and effective.

On one hand, ""The Queen"" depicts a monarchy that is cold and completely out of touch with modern day society. However, although I didn't always agree with Elizabeth's choices, it was easy to sympathize with her position and understand where she was coming from when she made certain decisions. Regardless of her personal feelings toward the late princess, the queen's belief that quiet dignity should be maintained before caving in to public spectacle is a very good point.

I highly recommend this movie to everyone, if for no other reason than that Mirren portrays Elizabeth II with more humanity than most people might believe is possible. This is truly an excellent film.",1188691200,6,2564,4.914549653579677
1561173,4,B00005JPAM,"The joy of this great piece of cinema is watching the violent collision of two parallel worlds coexisting in the present-day UK, the world of upper-class Victorian privilege and devotion to duty inhabited by the UK Royal Family, complete with its huntin', shootin', fishin', and the everyday world of all the rest of us. This is brilliantly captured in this film, especially with the flashes between the mannered, genteel Royal household and the chaotic, refreshingly normal Blair household.

The scenes in which collision first occurs are priceless; the slightly gauche young Tony Blair, fresh from a landslide General Election victory, confronts his Sovereign whose first Prime Minister was Winston Churchill, the anti-Royalist Cherie Blair sways in an incredibly precarious curtsey and then the Blairs back out of The Presence in the most awkward manner, because nobody turns his or her back on HM (""And it's ""Ma'am"", as in ""ham"", not ""Marm"" as in ""farm"", as a uniformed flunkey reminds them).

The greater collision was triggered by the death of Diana, and the sudden realisation by the Royals that something more than regal aloofness and stiff upper lips were necessary. Having apparently grown up with an assumption of the right to rule as their due and that the public would soon see things their way, the Windsors were suddenly confronted by the fact that the public saw Diana differently and what it thought of her - and them - mattered very much. In the end, you are left with the impression that Elizabeth Windsor, with the urging of Tony Blair, had learned something - but could perhaps usefully learn a bit more.

This is naturally a work of fiction - the Queen basically adheres very well to the formula of Walter Bagehot, the great 19th century editor of ""The Economist"", that not too much light should be allowed in for fear of destroying the magic, and so never gives interviews and rarely allows personal glimpses. We therefore have no idea as to what was said and thought. However, I found it all works extremely well. All the actors are excellent, especially Helen Mirren, thoroughly meriting her Oscar and proving that there really is nothing like a Dame. She manages marvellously the complex part of Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Sovereign of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc., etc, etc., with its mixture of absolute devotion to duty, traditional values, conservatism, basic shyness and elitism. James Cromwell does a good job of Prince Philip, whose idea of helping Diana's sons cope with her death is to take them out to shoot things, Sylvia Sims makes a delightful Queen Mother and  Charles is given a sympathetic portrayal, although it's a pity that they didn't get someone who looks more like him (but then, who would want to?).

All in all, a very good film which leaves one (this one anyway) wondering why the ordinary British people accept with relatively little complaint this bunch of toffs with virtually nothing in common with them (same number of heads, arms, ears, etc., but that's all) as their rulers. But then, the US public has recently twice voted into its Presidency the US equivalent of royalty, who has nothing in common with them and whose sole interest is lining the pockets of other rich guys. At least the Brits have (genuine) class. Perhaps they really have the right idea.",1187481600,4,3380,4.9020979020979025
1561174,1,B00005JPAM,"As with my Sin City movie review, I know that I am going to get crushed by my one star rating, especially with all the awards and press this movie has gotten, but here goes, my opposition review.

Basically, the whole flow of this movie feels like a bad TV soap opera drama, where pretty much nothing happens except people talking on their phone in their studies.  The whole sweep of the film is very, very clunky.  A lot of the sets feel very, very staged and cheap.  Seriously, there are a lot of British television shows that are a lot smoother, and less slow in pace.

As far as plot, you take an historical event that was extremely tabloid to begin with, and then try to fit it into the pace and style of a quiet British drama, and apparently the clash of cultures is supposed to make it look interesting.  It fails to clash in this regard, it looks like two separate movies.

As far as acting is concerned, Helen Mirren has done a better and more dynamic job in other films.  Yeah, this is not designed to be a dynamic role anyways, the Queen of England.  My opinion is this - it really doesn't take a lot of effort to display stoicism and lack of emotion across an entire movie.  The rest of the cast is really iffy as well- even James Cromwell.  And what's up with Tony Blair's  lips?  Too much makeup?

The sad thing is that I am the type of reviewer that generally likes this sort of film - I tend to steer away from heavy action and adventure and prefer drama.  I also would like to say that I don't really have a strong opinion on the British constitutional monarchy either, though this movie's plot is so lacking it never really gets to the deeper issues.

Go watch a nice British mystery drama instead.",1187049600,13,1716,4.299065420560748
1561175,4,B00005JPAM,"Obviously Princess Diana was a heavily celebrated individual and perhaps with good reason.  Her death was a tragedy and millions mourned.  Perhaps an inferior film would've focused more on her legacy and the behind the scenes feelings that Queen Elizabeth II had regarding The Princess of Wales.  But such expression on film is probably beyond reality as the Queen is by no means a visually emotional person.  Her opinions are more of an enigma and much of that is due to her discipline as Queen.  That is why the story of the interactions between Tony Blair and Queen Elizabeth II on how Diana's death should be treated is worth telling the way it has been here.  I don't think I came to that conclusion until half way through the movie, so I found it to be a very compelling film.

It opens with Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) winning the general election for Prime Minister.  Blair was of course an advocate to modernize the country so his early interactions with the Queen (Helen Mirren) were guarded right from the very beginning.  Princess Diana is soon killed in car wreck while being chased by paparazzi and Tony Blair delivers a speech that coins the title ""the People's Princess"" for Diana.  The Queen of course notes that Diana is technically no longer royalty as she divorced Prince Charles a year earlier.  She believes that the handling of Diana's funeral is to be a private affair and expresses this to Blair.  The result is of course a solid exploration of media hysteria, the Queen's devotion to her vows, and the contemporary dynamics of Royalty for better or worse.  All of these things are certainly elements I knew little about, at least to the extent it is observed here. I'm sure there are inaccuracies somewhere in this picture but not enough for me to pick up on.

There are four things that make this film exceptional.  Director Stephen Frears (the Grifters, Dirty Pretty Things) and screenplay writer Peter Morgan (The Last King of Scotland) did an outstanding job in their respective roles.  There is no question that creating a convincing portrayal of this story is no easy task but they managed to pull it off.  The other two items are the performances by Michael Sheen as Tony Blair and Helen Mirren as the Queen.  Sheen was a bit overshadowed by Mirren's performance but he is definitely great.  Mirren's acting on the other hand was universally hyped as the best performance of 2006.  Having seen the film well after the hype and awards I was certainly prepared to be critical of anything but there is no question about it, Mirren was outstanding and deserved her many glowing reviews, standing ovations, and awards.  The Queen is not necessarily written to be likable but she is still the focus of the film and Mirren takes on the task of making her enjoyable to watch and even to some degree relatable.

The Queen is a movie that some people will find slow, it is hardcore drama within a historical context that some will find less entertaining without a certain degree of back story.  If you found interest in what happened ten years ago in the aftermath of Diana's death then you will likely enjoy this film tremendously.  If for some reason that isn't your thing then you may want to take heed.",1186876800,7,3228,4.69271758436945
1561176,5,B00005JPAM,"This film is elegant, clever, interesting, profound, and, above all, incredibly funny! It is not a comedy really, but a very witty take on a crisis.
The film concentrates on the role of the queen during a tragic event. Some of the people surrounding her, like Prince Charles and Tony Blair catch on immediately that this crisis calls for action from the royals. However, the film makes it clear that the queen's reaction is colourde by her past: she experienced the crisis during her uncle's abdication - which lead to her own father's early death - and the horrors of the second world first hand. She could not understand the effect of the death of one royal on a public cushioned by a long time of relative peace and prosperity. However, she shows her strength by stepping down and acknowledging the grief of her people.
Prince Philip is mercilessly parodied as living in his own private reality which only momentarily toches our own reality! However, the film also delivers some kicks to both Cherie Blair and Alasdair Campbell as they are portrayed as extremely arrogant and self-righteous, and in a way are as separated from the common man as Prince Philip.
 The also hints at one more reason why the queen hesitated to assume leadership of the grieving masses: she also experienced the 1930s, and had a terrible fear of what could happen in times of mass-hysteria. She did not wan any part of that! She sees the role of the monarch as being a pillar of stability in a chaotic world.
The film offers no clear judgement of the actions of the queen, but it gives an explanation for her actions, and a possible understanding.
The film can also be seen as a comment on Tony Blair, as he himself got caugh in a swirl of hysteria and involved himself in the very questionable invasion of Iraq.",1186876800,2,1792,4.635220125786163

Helen Mirren rightfully received much critical acclaim and a deserved Oscar.  However, the rest of the cast, including Michael Sheen as Tony Blair and James Cromwell as the irascible Prince Philip deserve strong recognition for their performances.

The film does a superb of showcasing the struggle of what many consider an outdated institution with modern England during a time of crisis.  The restraint and ""dignity"" that served the monarchy so well, especially Elizabeth, after WWII clash with realities of the death of a commoner who endeared herself to the people of England and of the world.

Stephen Frears does an exceptional job interspersing television footage from Diana's death in a way that enhances the story, but does not become overly reliant or melodramatic.",1186272000,,915,5.026490066225166

It is amazing and unbelievable to me that the media has been able to generate such a ""mythological importance"" to Princess Diana that people in the general public who of course never knew her will camp out in the streets, cry and mourn for a literal stranger they have only seen in the news.

It's a weird modern mass media phenomenon.

This film reminds me of how the Queen was unfairly criticized by the media and public over not seeming emotional enough about Diana's death.

Not to detract from Diana, buts lets face reality....... it's a Cinderella story gone bad.

She was an immature girl who married into royalty, never appreciated the responsibility of the role and thus like a spoiled kid lashed out at the century old establishment.
Then she tried to establish her own identity as a caring person by being involved with humanitarian efforts while partying it up with controversial figures who she knew would cast a poor light on Mother England.

The two of them give towering performances that will remain indelibly impressed on your mind after viewing the film. Mirren is all crisp elegance and Sheen is a charmer who knows how to use his powers of persuasion. Both of them are ideally cast in roles they seem to inhabit with consummate ease.

The screenplay deals with the unpleasant private events unfolding at the palace while the public mourning was obviously so great that it had to be acknowledged. The Queen preferred keeping tight-lipped and dignified, obviously not a woman who was pleased with Diana's conduct. Nor was her husband Prince Philip (JAMES CROMWELL) or Prince Charles (ALEX JENNINGS) who at least reminded his mother that Diana loved her children dearly.

Handsomely photographed with newsreel footage of the crowds that began swelling shortly after Diana's demise in that tragic accident, it's dialog is convincing throughout, concise and to the point without any frills whatsoever. The only weakness in the casting would seem to be SYLVIA SYMS as the Queen Mother who somehow doesn't look the role.

The original background score by Alexandre Desplat is worthy of note, always appropriate and sometimes majestic. The scene with The Queen seeing the stag on the hillside while waiting for her car to be repaired is a standout, beautifully played.

Summing up: A rare treat, and a slice of history well worth remembering with the shift from the old monarchy to the modernized ideas of a young Prime Minister emphasized in the script.",1185580800,,1682,5.017921146953405

Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair meet as potential adversaries after his election to the post of Prime Minister.  He has ideas of change and reform; she intends to staunchly maintain tradition and protocol in the face of a changing world.  The public's reaction to Diana's death leads each one to challenge the other in often uncomfortable ways, yet through this challenge, each learns to bend without breaking.  They come to a place where they can indeed work together for the good of the country.  The director, Stephen Frears, makes us feel that we are witnessing the real behind-closed-doors conversations whose results play out in both the public and private arenas.  The changes wrought in the two main characters (the Queen and Blair) are subtle, and never presented in a heavy-handed way.

We, of course, can never know what was really said and done in the days following Diana's death.  We don't know if Charles was really as sympathetic as he appears in this film.  We don't know if Prince Phillip and the Queen Mum were really as callous and hard-hearted as they are presented here.  We do not know what exact words were exchanged between the Queen and Blair.

It boggles my mind how an entire nation, Britain could fall into such hysterical grief for a mentally unstable, bulimic, and adulterous princess named Diana. This woman was no Grace Kelley or Jackie O. Diana was nothing but white trash with a fancy title to her name. And yet millions cried and balled over her coffin. It's still absolutely mystifying to me.

1561333,4,B00005JPAM,"I admire what the filmakers attempted to do with this movie.  Stephen Frears's style is very matte, no gloss, which was the right medium to depict the restrained, modestly upright lifestyle of the royals.  You can't help but feel the stark difference between their demeanor and that of their subjects.  This is exacerbated by both side's reaction to the death of Lady Di.  The royals desired a private burial for Diana whereas the nation wished for a public one since she was considered the ""People's Princess"".  Throughout the movie you find yourself trying to identify with points of view and then figuring out which side was truly right to begin with.  Of course, none of this is resolved on screen, but the resulting events are well played out in a sort of denoument of compromise.

While Helen Mirren was spot on playing Queen Elizabeth, I felt Michael Sheen was also deserving of an Oscar for his portrayal of Tony Blair, handling his first official crisis after just stepping in office (ironically foreshadowing a real-life future one much larger than this).  Tony Blair, much like the audience, is caught somewhere in the middle, trying to understand both sides and come up with a resolution that allows both to save face.

1561335,5,B00005JPAM,"Watch this and it will be obvious why Helen Mirren won the Oscar for Best Actress for her remarkable portrayal of the seventy-year-old Elizabeth II, trying to cope with a world she no longer understands -- and doesn't really want to. The story line covers the week following the death in Paris of Princess Diana, which was also the very beginning of Tony Blair's decade as Labor Prime Minister. Many of those surrounding Blair (played very effectively by Michael Sheen) -- including his wife, Cherie -- were not sympathetic to anything about the Royal Family, whom they regarded as outmoded leeches on society. And while we will never know just how authentic Peter Morgan's first-rate script is, the viewer will come away convinced that Prince Philip and the Queen Mother, especially, had and have a 19th-century attitude of entitlement. Prince Charles comes off as a pathetic weakling, too, trying to sidle up to Blair for his own protection. Because of the Queen's insistence on ""privacy,"" her complete lack of understanding of the need of the public all around the world to mourn Diana, one quarter of the British people toward the end of that week were becoming convinced the monarchy should be abolished. (And that's my gripe with the real-world Blair, too: He had the chance to kill off the monarchy completely but he didn't take it. Instead, he converted to storybook royalism, a victim of mawkish sentimentality -- just as his wife warned him all prime ministers had done.)

1561337,4,B00005JPAM,"The cleverness of the premise of THE QUEEN--together with its career-defining performance by Helen Mirren--helped put it over the top with most critics in 2006 when it was released. Even now, when it's possible to look at it with a bit more soberness, it seems pretty nifty. The whole idea of doing a serious and intelligent look at the function of the constitutional monarch in contemporary Britain during its period of greatest trial (the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the outpouring of grief it produced and its new demands for a response from the queen) is just about irresistible, and the performance of Helen Mirren in the title role is nothing short of astounding.  One of the key plot devices (the hunting of the giant stag, ""The Monarch of the Glen,"" concurrent with the press and the Labor government's stalking of the queen) does come out as heavy-handed even more than when the film was released, and at times the film does seem a bit too much of a valentine to Elizabeth II. Despite her claims to her prime Minister Tony Blair of not going in for ""glamour and tears"" in moments of grief, we do get to see her suffering and mourning (both for Diana and for tradition) in private, and she's surrounded by such a pack of stiffs away at Balmoral that it's impossible not to feel sympathetic for her. The film conceives the other members of her family as strictly two-dimensional: Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is a sour bully, the Prince of Wales (Alex Jennings) is an opportunistic whiner, and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms) is an addled tippler. Compared with this lot, how could she help but come out smelling like a rose? Fortunately, Mirren is unafraid of bringing out the character's sourness when it suits her, and occasionally makes some wonderfully unexpected withering comments to her secretary (Roger Allam) and to Tony Blair (Michael Sheen, also terrific). Even though this is a plum role, Mirren is such a brave and strong actress that she makes even more of it than you'd think: she's absolutely marvelous in the final scene, where the hurt queen comes to meet with Tony Blair months after he thinks they have scored a victory with the public relations over Diana's funeral while she's still smarting from the wounds inflicted upon her by her people.

The big disappointments with this DVD release are its extras. There are some lovely moments on the ""Making of.."" brief documentary where Mirren explains her approach to the character, but there should have been much more from her and Michael Sheen. There are two sets of commentaries, one from royal expert Robert Lacey that's pretty standard (explaining away all the minor bits of court etiquette) and one from the director Stephen Frears speaking with the screenwriter Peter Morgan that's nothing short of disastrous. Obviously Frears and Morgan did not prepare for the commentary properly and felt that they had said everything about the film that needed to be said, because they offer very few illuminations about their ideas behind the work or the acting and directing; instead, they natter on about such dull trivia as why James Cromwell wears two dressing gowns and how the rooms they used to stand in for the drawing rooms at Buckingham Palace look nothing like the real thing. They come across as every bit as self-satisfied and as unrevealing as the very people the story is about. So skip the commentaries, and stay instead with the fine film as it is.",1184112000,3,3448,4.822635135135135

1561339,5,B00005JPAM,"Before I get into some random, slightly sarcastic, comments - directed at no one in particular and certainly meaning no disrespect to those mentioned - let me say I loved this film. But, I think it's meant for those who appreciate a good Jane Austen book or film - where people think and feel, as opposed to act. Very little seems to happen on the surface, while deeply held feelings bubble underneath.

This film seems very true-to-life, and only reiterates the irony of the events of 'that week' more than I felt at the time. The ultimate irony - which I felt at the time and now more so - is that Diana would have HATED the royal family pulling her back into their fold as much as they hated doing it. She loved her celebrity, without a doubt, and enjoyed the way she overshadowed the 'Establishment.' But I don't think she meant to ever become a part of it again - regardless of the fact that she was the mother of the future king (William). It occurred to me at the time that she would have hated her ex-husband going to France to claim her remains and bring them back to England. Even though her sisters were with Charles, in retrospect, perhaps her brother should have done it.

Some random thoughts:

1) Now we know the answer to the long-standing question 'What DOES she carry in that purse?'. The answer is --- a pen (to update the speech she is eventually talked into making about Diana).

2) What does the Queen use to touch up her nose after a cry? Her Hermes scarf, at least while she's alone in the Scottish countryside after her Land Rover breaks down.

3) Try as I may, I really never 'got' the subplot about the stag. What was it meant to symbolize? The stalking and subsequent death of Diana, the possible extinction of the monarchy...?

4) I was very surprised at the level of anti-monarchy feelings, had no idea Cherie Blair was so blatant.

All the parts are well-cast, especially Helen Mirren; her ability to get inside the skin of Elizabeth II was a wonder. She definitely deserved the Oscar for this performance. I appreciated the sensitivity with which the film dealt with Princes William and Harry, but was a bit surprised at the generous portrayal of Prince Charles and the almost-venomous way Prince Philip was portrayed. All in all, I think the film gives a sympathetic view to the Queen's (and the monarchy's) feelings about the death of Diana.",1183852800,,2375,4.548009367681499
1561340,5,B00005JPAM,"I remember seeing Helen Mirren years ago in an odd thing called ""O Lucky Man."" A wonderful film actually, but not terribly well-known, I guess. Anyway, it was a time in British film when actresses were expected to go topless so, like Glenda Jackson and the rest of her generation, dear, sweet Helen had to run around half-naked. Of course, viewers loved it. The point is that Ms Mirren has always been a daring, courageous actress, and I suspect it took a lot of guts for her to do the Queen. She is good, and the film isn't bad, although I suspect it will be remembered chiefly for the performances. The story is compelling, but the conflict seems very particular to its time, a unique and disturbing moment, but not one that points to universals. I can't help thinking that she deserves far more interesting roles. Like Guilgud, the great Shakespearean actor, if I am not mistaken, Mirren has Slavic (Russian?) blood in her, which perhaps explains her capacity for extraordinary passion. In this picture, it is all contained and repressed. I'd like to see it exposed.",1183852800,,1069,4.721925133689839
1561341,5,B00005JPAM,"The poster for ""The Queen"" - practically a study in Elizabeth's facial pores - led me to sense that the film would be a savage attack on the Queen and the monarchy. Instead, I found it to be an evenhanded and even sympathetic glance into the reaction of the Royal Family to British rage over their evident coolness to Princess Diana's death in 1997.

The film portrays the events in question in a fairly straightforward manner. After Diana's final death ride, the Queen and her family are rousted from sleep and watch the unfolding story on television at Balmoral castle in Scotland, privately expressing heartfelt annoyance that Diana is again generating attention. Prince Philip (played admirably by American actor James Cromwell) is especially furious throughout the film, expressing the royals' contempt for Diana and what they felt was public mawkishness egged on by the British press. Their official reaction (except, curiously, for Prince Charles's) was unemotional and measured, driven by protocol (whether to raise the Royal standard to half staff or to make public statements) and a continuing desire to keep Diana in her place.

Newly-elected PM Tony Blair (an incredible Michael Sheen) opposes the royals, but his close contact with them also lets him understand their point of view. Going against his young staff, whose anti-royal stance has them enjoying the Royal discomfort, Blair shows himself perhaps a bit too sympathetic to the Queen's plight, a tendency that might explain his recent woes.

""The Queen"" is a study in contrasts -- between the royal world of starchy reserve that no longer inspires, and the messiness of Tony Blair's TV-watching and cereal-chomping young family; between a confessional media culture (that Diana played to the hilt) and an older culture that prized privacy and decorum above all. The fun of the film is watching the Royals becoming aware of the need to embrace this new culture and by so doing remain at least minimally relevant to their people.

Helen Mirren both impersonates her subject (!) and interprets her. Mirren's performance helps the audience make sense of the Queen's inner struggle as well as of her professional carapace of detachment. A scene where she throw her pack of dogs of morsel of meat, and then with a hand gesture commands them to wait (they do!) before eating it, exemplifies the self-control that Elizabeth demands of herself and expects of those around her. Only once did the movie leap the bounds of plausibility, as the Queen, driving her own truck around Balmoral at the height of the crisis, gets stuck in the middle of a river. Her sighting of a beautiful, hunted animal begins to open her eyes to her people's grief over Diana, another beautiful ""animal"" hunted to death. Though the scene screams ""metaphor!,"" the script is silent, allowing the viewer to make the connection.

The DVD extras are spare, consisting of a not-too-revelatory ""making of"" mini-flick.

""The Queen"" is a standout movie, very solidly cast, very well-written, daring and successful in tackling recent events, believable and illustrative of the time period. That it does not hit one over the head with facile conclusions -- and that it allows a variety of points of view to co-exist unresolved -- demonstates its confidence and is very attractive.

I'd pick on the symbolism, but it's not really accurate to call that 14-point stag a symbol - more like a thematic bludgeon that the film wields with overwhelming artlessness.  Every scene's ""point"" is triple underlined and the dialogue is painful.  Tony Blair's defense of the queen is so awkward as to be laughable - and that's a ""climax"" of the film.  It's impossible to believe the man who pulled Britain kicking and screaming into Iraq (for better or worse) is as weak as he appears here.  As for Charles, it would be hard for a viewer unacquainted with his sordid story to even know he ever loved another woman than Diana.  This will be generally declared unwatchable in ten year's time.

1561413,5,B00005JPAM,"For the performance she presented in The Queen, Helen Mirren absolutely deserved to win the Oscar for Best Actress as she did. She was convincing in one of the most difficult roles any British actress could be called upon to play, and it was also courageous of this former Bond girl, often noted in American memories for being cast as great beauties and occasional seductresses, to lose herself as completely as she did in the Queen's stately contained matronly presence. Also deserving of note is Michael Sheen's chameleon-like transformation into Tony Blair. Sheen should have gotten more acclaim than he received for the skill with which he brought a still-relevant political figure so deftly to the screen. James Cromwell was great as always as the cantankerous old tyrant Prince Phillip, and only the casting of Alex Jennings as the Prince of Wales puzzled me, as Jennings, though a sound actor, did not seem to fit the part as well as many others could have. The Queen was, I thought, a riveting take on events that remain fresh in the collective minds of people around the world, and it managed to disarm cynicism and capture a convincing account of what would ordinarily be the private moments of highly public figures. In my opinion The Queen was so much better than anything nominated against it as Best Picture at last year's Academy Awards that it represented in its loss in that category the greatest mistake in Academy voting since Shakespeare In Love displaced Saving Private Ryan to take home top honors.

After all her years of service from the age of 15 fixing British army trucks during the blitz during WWII to the hard resconstruction years after the war, devoting herself 24 hrs a day to the British people , what was going through her mind as she faced those crowds that day and had to hear their applause for making her come down from Balmoral I can only guess.  I think what Tony Blair says about Diana & the Queen in this film was awesome, How could The Queen lead the world in mourning of a woman who threw everything she offered to her back in her face and in recent years has spent 24/7 trying to destroy all those things she holds dear ?.  I think Christopher Hitchens documentary  ""Princess Diana: The Mourning After"",  hit the nail  on the head. One thing I did not like about this movie was the way the Queen Mother was portrayed. Every Royal book written about her portrays her as 100% opposite the way this movie showed her. The producers of The Queen need to read some WWII history.",1183334400,3,1411,4.362595419847328
1561417,5,B00005JPAM,"Love Helen Mirren, (and loved her as a younger Elizabeth I in the HBO 2-part series as well, look for it!)and all the cast is excellent as well. But after reading Tina Brown's Chronicles of Diana and YES I know its' a rehash of what we all ""know"" of those years and that particular soap opera, but the last chapters of the book after Diana's death, are fascinating in that they are the same time period shown in ""the Queen"". According to people who were there, servants, officials and the like, the emotional sense of how the family reacted toward the young princes, William and Harry, has none of the coldness and emotional ""lets just get on with life"" attitude implied in the film and in the review, top, which says ""Prince Phillip clumsily tried to help by taking the boys hunting."" (paraphrased).  Well, these boys had spent their summer vacations riding and hunting at Balmoral all their lives, and this is what they thoroughly enjoyed. It wasn't something their stuffy old grandfather forced them to do. The book describes the entire Royal family rallying around the boys---Princess Anne, Charles' sister, brought her 20 yr old son and 16 yr old daughter, to help entertain their cousins, and she herself made a project of taking the very emotionally fragile Harry under her wing, and taking him riding and hiking out in the Balmoral hills alone. Charles pulled out family albums and spent time going over the past good times the family had had. Prince Phillip their grandfather, in particular, was very protective, showed ""gruff tenderness"" and did make sure they hunted,rode and kept active, as opposed to brooding and staying glued to the maudlin TV coverage. Actually, for the benefit of the boys, the Queen ordered all TVs and radios removed in the castle.  The outdoors life is one the family is used to and enjoys. Those who criticised the Royals for having the boys there in Balmoral instead of exposing them to the hysterical crowds in London...well, I don't know which would give them more nightmares in years to come but I can guess.  Also, other little tidbits in the book of that week were once when Prince Phillip came on the intercom when the decisions about the State funeral were being made and broke in, shouting, ""those boys have just lost their mother...they are not a commodity..."" Brown, the author quotes her source as saying ""you could hear the voice of a real grandfather."" Later, it was Prince Phillip, not Charles who talked the princes into walking in the moving spectacle of the royal men behind the cortege. He told the sobbing William, ""If I walk, will you walk with me?"" And during the long walk to the Cathedral, spoke quietly to the two boys of the famous sights they were passing, speaking softly the whole way there. All these vignettes, which would have made all the Royal more human, were left out of the film, good as it was, there was an agenda, that doesn't have to be spelled out.  The Queen could admire a royal appearing stag, later shown beheaded...but her love and her husband's love for the grandsons was never shown, nor was the love of the whole family for the boys or for each other, despite all Diana had done to blacken the reputation of that family in the press. Not that they're perfect, just human.",1183075200,2,3259,4.6923076923076925

The  Queen is never a caricature.  Still, the inner workings of the Royal Family and how their existence is a world apart from the commoners all around them is a eye opening and at times funny story.

Altogether a picture to remember.",1182816000,,401,4.7
1561493,5,B00005JPAM,"Good lord, where to begin. I saw this movie in theatres the second it opened here in Toronto; I wasn't particularly interested in the British Royal Family prior to having seen it and I didn't know much about Helen Mirren at all; I'd only seen her in Calendar Girls, but I thought the subject matter would be interesting and I was curious as to how they'd manage to pull off a depiction of Queen Elizabeth II.

I love this movie. I love everything about this movie, from the writing to the directing to the acting - especially the acting. Michael Sheen is terrific and captures the younger Tony Blair's boyish charm, enthusiasm, and knack for being in touch with what the public wants. James Cromwell and Sylvia Syms were great as Prince Phillip and the late Queen Mum, respectively, and Alex Jennings was adequate as Prince Charles; he at least half-convinced me that he was a whiner, which is what my opinion of Prince Charles was and still is. However, this movie of course belongs to Helen Mirren, who is a goddess of acting. She pefectly captures Queen Elizabeth II's grace, dignity, sense of duty, and dry wit, and manages to convey the sense of bewilderment that one would assume is natural for a person to feel when people who've loved you all your life suddenly hate you for doing what you think is appropriate. Regardless of Queen E's personal feelings about the late Princess Di, she did not stay holed up at Balmoral out of spite; she stayed there because she wanted to keep what was going on private. She doesn't believe in big public displays of emotion and never has, and prior to Princess Diana's death, the British public were by and large all right with that. How was she to know that in the blink of an eye, she was to abandon the way she'd always done things and behave in a manner that she considers to be distasteful?

This is a smart, sharp film, that tries to convey to the audience that no one is perfect, that everyone is human, and that everyone in it tried to do what they thought was right - and it reminds you that people have different ideas of what is right. For Tony Blair, it was obvious that the Queen needed to make more of an effort to convey that she was sad. For Queen E, it never occurred to her to express her feelings (aside from the statement of regret that had already been issued, which the movie does not make clear) in any other manner than was her custom: dignified, quiet, and private. The film is very informative and accurate, and everything about it is elegant and tasteful. Helen Mirren and the entire cast rule.",1182816000,2,2564,4.488222698072805
1561494,4,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirren won the Oscar of her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth for a very good reason. She stripped away all pretense of being a glamorous actress and made QE look like a human. As England rises in resentment over the Palace's lack of response concerning the death of Princess Diana, the Royal Family greet the public response as a passing phase. Just how greatly they misunderstood the public's love of Diana completely escapes them, to the point where every concession is met with greater derision within the walls of the royal confines. ""Celebrities and homosexuals,"" sneers Prince Phillip when he hears of the attendees planning on attending Diana's funeral.

The focus of ""The Queen,"" however, remains Queen Elizabeth. She gains humanity and humility as the movie progresses. She is hard as nails (the car breakdown scene is a hoot), but still feels compassion for a stag that is being hunted on the grounds. (The overbearing allegory of the stag and Diana is a bit much, though.) The prime moment of realization comes from a young girl with flowers in front of Buckingham Palace, and it also emphasizes what a splendid job Mirren did...she conveys so many emotions in just a few expressions and no words.

Mention also should be given to Hugh Cromwell, who plays Prince Phillip as a stuffy old coot with a typical out of touch Monarch's snobbery and Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. Sheen shows Blair transforming from radical modernizer into a fan of the details of royalty very effectively. There is also an interesting moment near the end of the movie when Queen Elizabeth tells Blair that someday the press and the people will inevitably turn on you. While we aren't certain if that conversation ever took place, it seems deliciously prophetic none the less.",1182729600,,1764,4.896321070234114
1561495,2,B00005JPAM,"I had heard great and wonderful things about this movie and about Helen Mirren's performance. I really didn't have very high expectations for this movie - I shouldn't have had any.

The film revolves around the time of Princess Diana's death and the royal family's reaction to it. The movie covers the span of about one week, though I think the director tried to do it in real time. This movie is just far, far too long for the material covered. How long and how many times must the audience be subjected to Blair stating Queen must ""do something"" publically, Queen refuses, Blair again states Queen should ""do something publically, Queen refuses, ad nauseum? And, in between, we are once again shown the same old tired film clips of Diana from years before. Dull, dull, dull!

As for acting? What acting might that be? I've heard wonderful things about Helen Mirren dipicting Queen Elizabeth II, but I just didn't see it. She played the Queen as the same stereotypical, dowdy, dry monarch that many perceive. Although many kudos to the hair and makeup team - they did excel, but an actress has no control over that. Mirren captured none of Queen Elizabeth II's grace, sense of duty, true love for her nation and people, and - most important - her wry sense of humor. Mirren simply played a dowdy old woman.

As for Sheen? I caught none of the spark that is Tony Blair. Rather, all I picked up was a hyperactive puppy, bouncing after important people's coattails and trying to impress the media.

I do have to admit the best line in the movie was delivered when the Queen told Blair upon first meeting that he was her 10th Prime Minister and that her first had been Winston Churchill. The irony is she will soon be facing her 11th Prime Minister. Anyone wonder if she will meet a 12th or 13th?

I'm puzzled by the overwhelming number of 5 star ratings here. I wonder that most people avoided nodding off as I did in more than one spot. Perhaps individuals who absolutly loved Diana? Or thought that the conversations between the royals were ""real"" and they got the true story? (As if anyone would actually know?) Simply just for Mirren's performance? (though how one can sit through an absolutely dismal and boring movie for the sake of watching one person's performance is beyond me) All I know is that in my opinion, this movie lived up to none of the hype it was given.",1182729600,5,2372,4.5717647058823525

1561498,5,B00005JPAM,"This is a beautiful film about how the Queen and the Prime Minister are able to work out a compromise on how to respond publicly to Princess Diana's death. It is startling to see how certain members of the royal family are completely out of touch with the modern world. Tony Blair walks the line between his sympathy toward those who see Diana as a people's princess, and his sympathy for the Queen, who carries herself with dignity no matter the situation.

She was looked down on because she reached out to others and was not afraid to be human.  She was a ray of sunshine in a drab grey existence!

1561500,4,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirren never disappoints.  Even in the bleakest thespian venues (i.e. Shadowboxer) her efforts shine forth.  And, in this film--however much a cliche it is to repeat--she IS the Queen.  Though the role is a natural for the very English actress, her study of Elizabeth II misses not a single beat, from the monarch's ages-old regal bearing to her endearingly quirky styles of pocketbooks and headscarves.

Mirren's character, however, comes across in many ways as a minor one.  The major thrust of the movie is the role (supposedly) played by Tony Blair in the events following Diana's death, and thus he emerges as the principal protagonist.  Michael Sheen's portrait of the prime minister is engaging and well done, but the attempt of the film's creators to put this slant on the action pushes the plot toward a suspiciously leftist turn that taints the storyline.  With his wife as a to-the-max classic foil, the white-knight PM expounds upon his reasons for saving the royals from themselves, and--if one is to believe this movie's premise--does so.

The film's other major flaw regards the renditions of Prince Charles and the Queen Mother.  Though Prince Philip is perfectly cast and portrayed by James Cromwell, the choice of Alex Jennings and Sylvia Syms as the former personages seems odd from the outset, and the scripting and direction under which they wilt has to make the viewer wonder whether sheer ignorance or outright agenda is to blame.  The portrayals appear so unlike the actual strong-willed and rigid-spined individuals that only stark circumstance or referral by name make them recognizable.  Charles is rendered as retiring, wavering, and ineffectual, his visage endlessly pinched by an unripe-persimmon-sucking grimace.  He is said to fear assassination--and better the Queen than he--when, in reality, the man failed to even flinch when shot at in Australia.  While he appears to be the royal who popularized the among-the-people walkabouts and reportedly goaded the Queen into action after Diana's death, these feats are credited to Blair in the movie.  And the Queen Mum, the redoubtable dowager who remained stylish and pump-shod into her 90's, comes off as doughy and shambling and little more than a sounding board for her daughter.  And the character's assertion that the monarchy will be in peril when Charles--purportedly her favorite grandchild--takes the throne?  Only the strange and fictional Charles of this film.

Of course, the feature's creators would undoubtedly admit to a great deal of embellishing and fleshing-out fiction.  It goes too far, though, in the implication that the Queen had not mingled with the common folk since World War II or that the emotional implications of hunting had never crossed her mind.  And, given that the main enjoyment of this feature comes from Mirren's amazingly exacting portrayal, it seems a shame that all the depictions are not as diligently pursued.",1181952000,2,2938,5.199575371549894

Queen Elizabeth II is caught in a very hard place when her public seems to demand an outward show of emotion and the Queen wishes to hold fast to the tradition of private mourning.

I watched the first thirty minutes hoping it would live up to the hype, the second thirty minutes were spent wondering why I was still watching it, and finally I came to my senses and ejected it. Charles is portrayed sympathetically? He was shown as a sniveling whiney person who was afraid to call the PM himself. The only interesting thing in the part that I watched was when Queen E put Tony Blair in his place by telling him he was her tenth PM, and that Winston Churchill had sat in that chair and had offerred her useful advice.

That she does marvelously, so that after viewing the film it is almost difficult to recall the actual Queen as she really is. The depictions of Prince Philip and Prince Charles are less successful. ""Tony Blair"" on the other hand is almost as good as the Queen. Other pluses are being able to see the insides of Balmoral Castle, as well as the protocol that governs the visits of the PM  to see the Queen.

1561557,5,B00005JPAM,"There are several themes to this excellent and most original and interesting film; but what it is about more than anything else is how political regimes and whole dynasties can be undone on account of a single error of judgment. It is only near the end that Her Majesty warns her prime minister that this will happen to him, and happen suddenly and without warning. It had nearly happened to her, he had been the saving of her on this occasion, and her dire prediction for him probably holds an uneasy message for herself too.

At the start the Queen is full of regal self-assurance, neatly putting her boyish and slightly nervous novice of a prime minister in his place by telling him he is sitting where Churchill once sat. In next to no time the positions are reversed, as Blair's acute political antennae tell him that HM is in imminent danger of losing her subjects' allegiance, something that would have been unimaginable only days previously, through trusting her own judgment and listening to the advice of her husband and her mother in respect of how to react to the death of Princess Diana. Throughout the crisis Blair is adroit and sure-footed, the monarch is made to realise bitterly from the newspapers how he has it right and she has been hopelessly at sea, but unlike her family counsellors she has the wit to swallow her pride and retrieve the situation before it slides beyond retrieval. This one incident could have undone a lifetime of unswerving dedication, universally acknowledged, to her country, and put the skids under the House of Windsor itself. Her warning to Blair is really made from a new sense of respect and a shocked realisation of how quickly and brutally the tables can turn. And how right she has been. This film does not make the matter explicit, but any viewer can sense the irony of Blair's own political fate. For years he seemed unable to put a foot wrong as far as the public were concerned, his luck was near-incredible (and his political nous was enormously greater than Churchill's); and then he blew it all with one foolish and ill-considered assertion in the Commons about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Just one mistake, when one is not sensing danger, is enough.

The depiction of the main players is brilliant, and I found it fascinating to guess just how accurate it may be. Leaks, rumours, gossip and memoirs certainly descend on the public these days like leaves in Vallombrosa, giving us some shaky basis for forming a judgment. In the nature of the case a prime minister has to make himself (or herself) familiar to a rightly suspicious electorate, but a monarch should always retain some mystique, and the other dramatis personae, even the heir to the throne, are only intermittently in the limelight. Inevitably and rightly the film's characterisation is creative, but it is coherent and convincing provided one does not mistake it for portraiture from life. The acting has been widely praised and I concur entirely. The atmosphere is beautifully touched in too, from the family life of the Blairs (and the Windsors) to the blokeish informality of the New Labour apparatchiks in Downing Street and above all the hushed flunkeyish reverence accorded to the Queen, cocooning her in the chrysalis that nearly devoured her.

I hope there is no possibility of a sequel, as a masterpiece like this should be left unique. Within days now Her Britannic Majesty will be welcoming a new prime minister whom she probably suspects of being a closet republican, as I suspect he is too. I shall be watching out all the same for one thing that this film says clearly through the lips of Cherie Blair, something to the effect that all Labour prime ministers finish up devoted to the Queen. Maybe it will be the same story with Brown, but I wonder how matters will stand once the monarch is no longer Elizabeth II. When that becomes the case the story of Princess Diana is likely to open a new chapter.",1181433600,57,3949,4.753644314868804
1561558,5,B00005JPAM,"I had wanted to see this movie for a long time and finally did last night.  This movie held my interest from beginning to end.  Helen Mirren deserved her Oscar for her portrayal of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

This movie covers Tony Blair's landslide election in 1997 and his first meeting with the Queen.  Then we jump to August 30, 1997 when Princess Diana was killed in that infamous car wreck, the aftermath and how the Royal family, especially the Queen, was harshly criticized for not speaking out earlier and trying to comfort her people.

She meant no harm, but truly believed she was doing the right thing by staying at Balmoral and tending to Diana's boys and their emotional needs.  She assumed the ""people"" would expect her to remain silent and out of sight.  She couldn't have been more wrong.  She truly had no idea the huge impact Diana's death had on her people or people around the world.  As Prince Charles says in the film, the Diana they knew and experienced had no connection whatsoever to the public Diana and how the public felt about her.  He knew better than anyone how the public felt about Diana, and he knew the awful consequences of ignoring or dismissing that adoration.

As I remember reading in one account at the time that the British people were ""delirious"" with grief.  I, myself, felt deeply grieved and depressed for about two weeks after her death.  It hit me hard.  I had gotten up in the wee hours to watch Diana's wedding.  And I got up early to watch her funeral.

Poor Tony Blair tried to tell the Queen what was going on and what she needed to do, and at first the Queen thought he was just wet behind the ears and clueless about ""her"" people.  Tony Blair comes to admire and respect the Queen, and even feel affection and sympathy for her.  Her father became King after his brother King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson.  Elizabeth's father was never groomed for the throne as his brother had been, and many blamed the stress for his early death.  Upon her father's death, Elizabeth ascended to the throne as a young woman.  As the Queen's aide tells Mr. Blair, the Queen had not experienced something like this (the furor after Diana's death) since the abdication and she was in shock.

Queen Elizabeth redeems herself in the end, and continues to hold the affection of the British people, as well as Americans and millions around the world.  I think this film shows us a stoic, self-contained woman, but a woman who truly wants to have the affection of her subjects and to serve them well.",1181433600,4,2583,4.591703056768559

As a history teacher and history buff I am a fan of British history and I am a fan of tradition.  I had a feeling this film would try to tear down British royal tradition and would simply portray both the Royal family and the Queen in a negative light for their actions in the aftermath of the death of Diana.  I couldn't have been more wrong.

After leaving the theater I was impressed not only with the plot, the characterization and the cinematography, but I was impressed with Helen's performance.  Having been a fan of her work since Excalibur, I knew she had a great deal of talent.  However, in this film she took the performance to another level.  Oscar winning performance indeed!  She looked like the queen, she sounded like the queen, she transformed herself INTO the queen.

The story itself was well written and did a good job of presenting both sides of the issue:  it presented the Queen's side, which is that Diana was no longer a royal and therefor should not receive the ""Royal"" treatment.  It also presented the side of Tony Blair and the English people.  In essence this film is exploring the paradox of an ancient monarch living in the modern world.  While Elizabeth herself is NOT ancient, the monarchy itself, as an institution, is itself ancient.

1561634,4,B00005JPAM,"The Queen focus on two important events during the summer of 1997.  The first event is the election of Tony Blair as Great Britian's Prime Minister and the second event is the death of Lady Di in Paris. This movie is a glittering, compelling, solemnly anxious news comedy of how the Royal family reacted to her Diana's death. The Queen, Prince Philip, Mother Queen and Prince Charles, all in their own ways, disliked Diana for what she had done to them, which was to turn the public love from the royals to her (Diana). The Queen's intentions are honorable because she wanted to protect her grandsons from the hounds of the media because she believed focusing too much on Diana's death would aggravate their grief. The Queen can't help how she feels, she was being the way she was raised, keeping things to herself, maintaining the immemorial English stiff upper lip.

The Brits are known for their toughness and for being rational people. These are the same people that bravely stared Hitler in the face and survived his days of terror during WW2. Its that quality (that bulldog-ness effect) that has earned the British people respect from around the world. Its my opinion that the British was ready to cry that faithful week in 1997. For so long in their long history, they held back public tears, but the loss of Diana tugged at their heartstrings and they cried (in public). This caught the Queen by surprise as she must have realized her people have changed. It was up to Tony Blair to convince the Queen she must change too (in some areas).

Helen Mirron is simply extraordinary. She made you feel the queens's pain, agony, and confusion. James Cromwell is a wonderful actor and his protrayal of Prince Phillip as a selfish nincompoop (well, that is true to form) is funny and brilliant. Michael Sheen bears a close resemblance to a younger Tony Blair, and has clearly studied him closely in order to catch his every gesture and nuance. I was not, however, particularly impressed by his performance because he seemed to mimic Blair rather than take the essence of Blair and act him out. The Queen Mother comes across as a bit of a drunk and a selfish woman. Cherie Blair, who would like to see the destruction of everything British, is admirably shown. However, the worst performance of the movie goes to Alex Jennings's Prince Charles because at times he seemed the most sympathetic of the Royals, at others weak and cowardly.

Near the end of the film, it is clear the Queen and Blair relationship has warmed and they both have a great deal of respect for each other. The wise Queen takes the opportunity to warned then popular Blair that the tide can easily turned against him....and 10 years later, it has thanks to Blair's foreign policy. Not a great film, but a good film with an important lesson to learn.",1181001600,5,2818,4.675403225806452
1561635,4,B00005JPAM,"I shall begin this review by saying that I was not an avid fan of Princess Diana.  I remember her very well when I was a child with the hubbub about the royal wedding, and she had always been one of the most prominent celebrities that I knew of.  It seems that at any one point in time someone was talking about Diana.  I said at some point that it was just celebrity garbage and fluff, and gave a big ""Who cares?"" about it.  But if I didn't care, why did I wake up my mom in the middle of the night on that faithful day in 1997 when she was killed in a car accident in Paris?  And watch the funeral on TV a few days later?

I did not watch this movie based on a celebrity fascination with Diana or any other of the British royal family, but to see the true flow of relationship between the government houses.  Helen Mirren does a superior job of portraying Elizabeth II, refined and stiff upper lipped to the T.  At the same time, just weeks before, Tony Blair had been elected, the first time in years that the Labour Party had been appointed as Prime Minister.  It was also a very exciting time in England, as there was a sense of change with his election.  Just as Tony Blair was getting his feet wet in his new job, Diana is killed in a car accident.  The UK, let alone the rest of the world, was thrown into chaos.  We looked to the queen to make a statement, but she remained silent.

This movie showed the tensions and conflict very well between the royals and the public.  Elizabeth had distain for Diana, to be sure, after the tabloid fiasco of her and Charles's divorce, so she wanted to remain silent.  From another generation of royalty and duty, she wanted to remain silent to show her respects; but, the public wanted to hear a statement as it's a different world now.  Plus having a new, enthusiastic Prime Minister pressuring her to adjust (I love that scene where they meet for the first time and she said ""Winston Churchhill sat in that very same chair"".), she had to say something.  And she did.

The only critical words I have for this movie are for the portrail of Prince Charles.  I wonder how true his reaction to Diana's death was.  It's hard for me to believe that Charles shead a tear for Diana.  After their failed marriage and divorce, I'm sure there were and still are sour grapes between them.  If anything I would think that he would be glad to be rid of her once and for all, because his aunt, Princess Margaret, said it best when she said that Diana was more annoying dead than alive.

Still, this is a fine movie that flows very easily and shows a good snapshot of a point in time.",1181001600,5,2616,4.251012145748988
1561636,5,B00005JPAM,"Commenting on ""The Queen"" is a bit like daring to touch the Mona Lisa - there is little that might be done to improve it and much that would not.

Helen Mirren is brilliant. She conveys a sense of that regal place, owned by  ruling monarchs, of tension between service and leadership - modernity and tradition - privacy and publicity. ""The Queen"" is a picture of paradox: a woman wholly-sacrificed for her people and a people willingly sacrificed for their sovereign. Mirren captures the paradoxes of the servant (whomever would be the greatest must be the servant of all) so beautifully and stoically.

In our world, some arrive at their life's positions by talent, some by hard work, others by luck. But the Queen of England is thrust into her world and her position by divine Providence. And for us mere mortals, Mirren's performance is all that.",1180915200,3,849,4.761904761904762

1561638,5,B00005JPAM,"""The Queen"" (2006) starring Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II has got to be one of the most realistic and revealing portrayals ever of any monarch on film. Mirren effortlessly becomes Elizabeth; the few stirring weeks captured in the film tell the viewer much about the entire life of the queen as well as the nature of monarchy. Too often filmmakers, particularly those from Hollywood, project the misconception that being a royal means getting to have everything you want and ordering people around in a haphazard manner. In ""The Queen,"" Her Majesty is portrayed as addressing everyone, especially her domestic staff, with exquisite courtesy and consideration. From what I have read about the private lives of the various royal families such behavior on the part of a sovereign is much closer to the reality than any crass barking of orders. This is not to mitigate moral shortcomings; I am referring only to surface behavior, which nevertheless can and does indicate one's general attitude towards others. Elizabeth II comes across as first and foremost a servant of her people.

The film opens with the Queen having her portrait painted, sending the message that the story one is about to see is a portrait come to life. And indeed it is. It is also the portrait of monarchy in the modern world. Tradition is confronted with waves of constant change; some concessions must be made in order to survive. The scenes of the royal family ""at home"" almost reminded me of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette at the Tuileries--living in a gilded cage with no actual freedom or power. And yet Mirren subtly and dynamically captures the personality of the quiet little woman who embodies an ancient institution which only her presence and her dignity can salvage. What is especially fascinating is how the queen wins over socialist Tony Blair; he becomes her champion and the savior of the monarchy. It called to mind how dedicated revolutionaries like Mirabeau and Barnave were deeply moved after meeting Marie-Antoinette and wanted to do everything they could to help her.

What is especially compelling about ""The Queen"" is that it involves events which many people today have lived through, with the main characters being a reigning sovereign and a sitting prime minister. It evoked memories of the day Princess Diana died. I thought people were being a bit harsh on the queen even then and I saw nothing wrong with the royal family staying at Balmoral to grieve in private, although to everyone else in the world it was a major calamity. Queen Elizabeth's devotion to duty and her dedication to the vow she made to serve her people are shown in sharp contrast to Diana's futile and tragic quest for personal happiness.

I am always annoyed when people compare Diana to Marie-Antoinette, calling the Queen of France a ""Lady Di before her time."" Yes, they both loved children, fashion, and had many charities. But when her world fell apart, Marie-Antoinette steadfastly stayed at her husband's side, although everything in her wanted to get her family away from danger. But Louis would not leave his people and Marie-Antoinette would not leave her husband, although she had many opportunities to escape. Diana had very different ideas about duty and marriage. Marie-Antoinette would not leave; Diana did. I do not condemn Diana; she had a lot with which to contend. Queen Elizabeth II, however, is of the old school, when duty, honor, discretion and commitment came before the pursuit of happiness.",1180828800,2,3491,4.984562607204117
1561639,5,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirrim rarely misses a beat, and if she ever does, no one would ever notice (except maybe her), but she is stunning and totally convincing in her role as the Queen. I wonder if the Queen has seen it and what she thinks of how the Royal Family was portrayed in their dislike of Dianna; but whatever she felt, she put it all aside for the 'good of the people' and that came through ever so stunningly. It made us realize that the Queen of England is truly one 'for the people' and when push came to shove, she humbled herself magnificently and did what she needed to do.",1180742400,4,574,4.2272727272727275

i must say ..i loved how ms. mirren looked so much like the real deal .  also the direction was good and scenery .  now here's where i make enemies ..lol

most of us were among the living when Diana died so, the only real truth were the edited, melded  in news  films of that shocking time .

what bothers me is ..how the heck does anyone know what the queen said in the privacy of her quarters with hubby and the queen mum ?  so, everyone who takes that as hard truth must believe in the easter bunny as well .
no way anyone could know ..if someone overheard ...she'd know and ...goodbye to them at the ole palace .off with their head .

well, i almost bought the dvd on the strength of ms. mirren being in title role BUT, was spared the money when it was first loaned to me .

yes, i guess it's worth watching once if you are among the curious or weren't near any t.v.'s when diana died or maybe believe in those  reality shows where cameras ( viewers can't see )  are all over the stars  house and some people actually  believe we are true voyeurs getting our very own private lookyloo  ...lol.

hellen mirren deserved the academy award ....acting good ...likeness near perfect . but, again , where did the private dialogue come from ?  not from the real queen , you bettcha.

anyone believe the prime minister  gave out secret conversations ?  I mean really ? and as for bonny prince charles , i'm guessing that after the initial shock of  hearing of Diana's death he and his then mistress were privately singing a couple choruses of "" OH HAPPY DAY "" !!!  rent the dvd ..once is plenty .",1180742400,2,1852,4.198863636363637
1561679,5,B00005JPAM,"This movie portrays the time from the beginning of Tony Blair's era as Prime Minister through the difficult days of Princess Diana's death.  It shows the tenuous relationship between Queen Elizabeth II and the Prime Minister and traces the seeming indifference of the monarchy to the tragedy in Paris.  The Queen, Prince Philip, Charles, William, and Harry are at Balmoral Castle in Scotland when Diana is killed, and at first they do not respond to her death, calling it a ""private, family matter"" and assuming that the public would want them to handle it in a dignified and quiet manner.  Tony Blair (played brilliantly by Michael Sheen) has his hand on the pulse of the nation and he tries to warn the Queen that she is going against public opinion by staying silent.  Helen Mirren plays the queen with wonderful dignity and restraint and shows her to be the dutiful monarch that she is, but she also shows us flashes of the human side of her, such as when she admits to the Prime Minister that she has ""never been so hated before"".  It is very difficult to portray a contemporary occurrence in a movie, but the script-writer and actors get this one just right.",1180656000,5,1164,4.658536585365853
1561680,3,B00005JPAM,"It seems a little unfair to rate this movie with only three stars because the direction is assured, the script is intelligent, and the acting is workmanlike in all respects.  As other reviewers have noted, the movie covers the period between British Prime Minister Tony Blair's accession to 10 Downing Street (the home of the British leader) and the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana, formerly the wife of the British heir to the throne, Prince Charles.  The movie resists the temptation to score easy points.  Tony Blair is presented as a rounded character rather than the ""Tony Blur"" he was known as just prior to the 1997 election.  The Queen and the rest of the royal family and their retinue are clearly living in a time warp, utterly out of touch with the rest of humanity, yet the movie doesn't set them up just to knock them down.  In the end the Queen is seen as a tragic sort of character and Tony Blair develops a sincere admiration for her, even as he is frustrated by her inability to grasp the essentials of the situation she faces.

So much, so good.  The drawbacks, however, are these: complex relationships have to be encapsulated and summed up in one scene or less.  Thus Prince Charles' resentment over his own childhood is force-fitted into a scene in a Land Rover where he implicitly criticises his mother the Queen by talking about how warm and loving and good a mother his ex-wife Diana was.  Likewise the Queen's sense of being trapped in a role she never wanted is summed up on a Scottish moor, where she sees a magnificent stag.  It represents the freedom she never knew.  No matter how well-intentioned these vignettes are, they are inevitably somewhat clumsy in a movie that is above all else trying to reconstruct real events.

The second problem is that when the subjects of a movie are still very much alive and in place, any representation of them treads a fine line between caricature and irrelevance.  Actors have to mimic expressions and manners of speech rather than interpret roles according to their own strengths.  We are always uncomfortably conscious of the fact that the movie Queen looks very like, but not really exactly like, the real Queen.  Likewise the movie Blair is very like, but not really exactly like, the real Prime Minister.  This dissonance is reduced as much as possible by excellent direction, but it is never entirely absent.

The result is a very enjoyable movie that brings real warmth and sympathy to almost all the characters we encounter, with the exception of Prince Phillip, husband to the Queen.  By all accounts the real Consort has few if any redeeming features so the movie reasonably enough doesn't stretch our credulity by trying to imply there might be some lurking deep out of sight.

Definitely watch this movie if you have any interest at all in contemporary social events in Britain - it's probably as realistic a depiction of some fascinating people as we are likely to get.  But in the end, while it succeeds as a humanistic undertaking, it somehow just falls short as art.",1180656000,3,3060,4.726930320150659

Helen Mirren is great as the Queen herself.  Because the movie looks at the inside family drama, you see the Queen as a real person; sadness, irritations, quiet, and occasionally cracking a joke (very occasionally!).

Very informative too about the relationship with the Prime Minister Tony Blair. I liked seeing how their different perspectives on the media came together and shaped each of them in a new way.",1180396800,,661,4.927927927927928
1561684,5,B00005JPAM,"Apparently the British public is just as foolish over the cult of celebrity as the U.S. I put Diane in about the same category as those other one name wonders like Paris or Brittany or Lindsey. Whatever she was, it was totally as the result of being the wife of the next king of Britain & the mother of the heir, with a spare. Those pseudo-mourners who hate the royals need to remember without a monarchy, Diane would have been a cute, kindergarten teacher from a prominent family. Her charitible works, eliminating land mines, helping people with AIDS could have been done by anyone if given her oppotunities. The first one, marrying into the royal family & the second, sleeping with the son of one of the richest men in the world. That royalty should even exist as parasites on the British people, the fact is they do. Therefore the people demanded the Queen grieve as they did. Give her grandsons up to be viewed & pitied. It was not her way. Helen Mirren was dead on as the Queen, as was Michael Sheen as the PM, Tony Blair. Always the politician, Blair was instrumential in convincing the Queen into making a statement concerning Diane's death, as he did. The monarchy does move toward modernity at glacial speed. The evolution from the Queen Mum, to Elizabeth, to Charles is evident in this movie. He considers himself a modern man. Even 10 years ago...not. His son, William also a future King, is. Although this movie takes place in a short period of time in 1997 you get a lot of inside information on the monarchy & the life of Elizabeth II. I think she is loved, & respected as maybe representing not the way things are but once were. Maybe not such a bad thing.

Of course, no one rally knows what goes on behind closed doors at the Royal Palace, so the ingenuity of director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan were put to task and have created a witty and fascinating scenario. Then I listened to the DVD commentary track and realized that there were dozens of in-jokes, many of which were ultimately cut.  There's a moment when Tony Blair (brilliantly played by Michael Sheen) points out that the queen was literally forced into her position, giving up any sense of a normal life. When the Queen sees the beautiful stag, wandering freely, always in danger, I almost thought that she wished she could trade places. Later, she was more concerned about the ultimate fate of the stag that she altered her plans. I liked Helen McCrory as Mrs. Blair, the voice of public opinion regarding the Royal Family, especially at the beginning. Prince Phillip was presented (by James Cromwell) as somewhat of a buffoon, and I enjoyed Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother. Alex Jennings was very good as Prince Charles, hoping that Tony Blair would ""modernize"" things in England so he could relax a bit.

1561749,4,B00005JPAM,"The movie starts with a blip over the election of Tony Blair to Prime Minister, and quickly skips forward to the horrible day that Princess Diana died.  Caught in all the media frenzy is Queen Elizabeth II, not a fan of Diana to begin with.  The Queen wishes to keep the royal family's mourning private, but the public outcry for closure forces her to come out of her privacy shell, return to the palace from their country estate, and make a public statement.

The movie provided some private peeks into royal life, such as the queen driving herself up into the boondocks of her estate and getting her jeep stuck in a river.  A vision of the stag her grandsons are hunting leaves her with a haunting vision of its grandeur.  It's hard to image the queen doing such mundane things as driving a jeep or setting a glass of water by her bedside instead of simply snapping her fingers for water whenever she wants it.

There's some great acting here too.  Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and the incomparable James Cromwell as Prince Philip are spectacular in their roles.  The dialogue is a bit stiff at times, but it's hard to tell if its from the scripting or on purpose because of the stiffness and formality of the royal family's, and the British elite's, communications.

One strange thing I couldn't help noticing were the phones used as props.  Some were ancient desktop rotary phones and yet in other scenes there were modern cellular phones.  Perhaps I noticed this because I became a bit bored with the sometimes slow and stale progress of the film, but I'm sure if I decided to watch it again I would find another discrepancy.

Weakness to me was that the plot did not have enough weight for my personal taste, and some details were overplayed to enhance the character of the Queen.  Helen Mirren did portray the Queen adeptly, and with regalness.

Strongest point was the crowd scene at the entrance to the grounds.  The glances, the small commentary gave the viewer a deep look into the nature of the Queen.

1561753,5,B00005JPAM,"""The Queen"" chronicles the behind-the-scenes drama of the British royal family in the week following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on the 30th of August 1997. Princess Diana' death plunges the monarchy into an unexpected crisis when public grief overflows into the streets and parks. Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) considers Diana's death a private affair and can't fathom her people's need for a public funeral or acknowledgement from the royal family: ""The less attention one draws to it, the better."" Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), elected head of the government by a landslide just a few months before, understands what the public expects and the dangers of the monarchy not fulfilling that role: ""Will someone please save these people from themselves?"" So he advises, pleads, and cajoles the Queen into making a public tribute in the face of growing anti-monarchist sentiment.

Helen Mirren won an Oscar for her portrayal of this monarch who keeps her feelings so much to herself that people tend to doubt that she has feelings. I'm not convinced myself, but ""The Queen"" offers an interesting perspective on Her Majesty's stoicism: Duty precludes her from ever being partial. She can't even vote. And she despised Princess Diana -with good reason- so was probably not anguished by her death. In presenting Diana's death from the perspective of the royal family, secluded at Balmoral Castle, the film tries to make the Queen a sympathetic figure, a bastion of traditional culture suddenly confronted with a celebrity culture that she does not understand. This does little in my mind to alleviate the fact that Queen Elizabeth II utterly lacks leadership skills, charisma, and is so uncomprehending of her own culture that she erodes the usefulness of the monarchy. But I have to admit that she -or her verisimilitude- is fascinating to watch.

We also see the perspective of Tony Blair and his staff at 10 Downing Street on Princess Diana's death and that of the British public, who are represented by real television news footage. In fact, everyone is experiencing the crisis through television. The royals, the government, and the public spend a lot of time watching each other on TV. It's difficult to know where director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan's sympathies lie, if anywhere. The events of ""The Queen"" resulted from the clash of three dysfunctional parties, though the film does not explicitly say so: mentally ill Princess Diana, emotionally stunted and out-of-touch Queen Elizabeth II, and the British people whose initial expressions of affection and grief quickly degenerated into an obscene display of self-pity.

If you're wondering how screenwriter Stephen Marber knew what happened behind closed doors in the days following Princess Diana's death, he drew on his own sources inside 10 Downing Street and those of historian Robert Lacey inside Balmoral Castle. Mr. Lacey wrote the book ""Majesty"" about the reign of Elizabeth II and served as consultant on this film. Beside the obvious inability to know the precise content of private conversations, some liberties have been taken with the story, including the subplot involving the stag at Balmoral, which serves as metaphor. And a wonderful metaphor it is. ""The Queen"" is a sublimely insightful film that possesses more gravity than any of its dramatis personae would seem to merit alone.

The DVD (Miramax 2007): There are a making-of documentary and 2 audio commentaries. ""The Making of The Queen"" (18 min) has 3 parts: the cast, director Stephen Frears, and other crew discuss the challenges of portraying real people; the environments of the film as created through production and costume designs; and crew members talk about their experiences of the week that Princess Diana died. The first audio commentary by director Stephen Frears and screenwriter Peter Morgan is sporadic and addresses a miscellany of topics without being informative. Skip it. The second audio commentary by historian Robert Lacey is excellent and very worthwhile if you enjoyed the film. Lacey discusses the film's themes of traditional vs celebrity culture and the perspective of the royals vs the public. He explains the context of events and the meaning of protocols. He tells us what is and is not based on fact as far as it could be ascertained, takes us through the actions of the characters, and explains the politics for us foreigners.

1561757,5,B00005JPAM,"The Queen was a fantastic depiction of the way that Queen Elizabeth may have felt following the death of Princess Diana.  Despite all of the media hype about the latter, this movie is new, fresh and surprisingly funny.  I laughed out loud a number of times both at the Queen and with her.

How can an apple become an orange?  That's what Elizabeth had to do after the sudden and shocking death of her son's ex-wife, whom she had never liked to begin with.  A reserved, imminently proper woman, Elizabeth was completely out of touch with the need of the public to grieve.  She wanted to mourn privately but didn't understand that the country lost Diana too and had to have more closure.  Although she wanted a private service, she needed to bend and come round to something that eventually included pop stars like Elton John -- a 180 turn that was most difficult for her.

As always, Helen Mirren is nothing short of amazing.  I've loved her since her early days in Prime Suspect and have watched every episode!  She doesn't disappoint here either; neither does the character who plays Tony Blair, whose name escapes me at the moment.

Acting is great, story is wonderful.  Only question I had was the reliability of the details and facts -- were those leaked by palace insiders?  Interesting to know... This is a movie I could watch two or three times and probably will!

In retrospect, the massive mourning over Diana seems excessive and silly. The Queen's initial reaction of having a private funeral was the right choice but the crowds were insane - making much more of Diana than she deserved. In my opinion, the Queen was not out of touch - the British people were - so dazed by a foolish celebrity culture that they were no longer rational. Yes, Prince Philip comes off as stupid - most of the Royal family are. The Queen, however, has conducted herself with a great sense of duty and faithfulness to her people. Unfortunately, in the weeks after Diana's death, rationality and intelligence were difficult to come by. This movie is what many of us crave - an adult drama free of special effects and comupter generated aliens.

1561894,5,B00005JPAM,"I just finished watching The Queen; starring Helen Mirren, who won this year's Oscar, and a powerful cast of stars who support the story of a week in the life of the Queen of England right after p. Diana's passing away in a car accident.

The movie shows a rare glimpse into the private lives of the Royal Family of Great Britain. A human angle, if you will. Sitting together in a family room, which looks like a family room in a typical middle class house. But logical in its dimensions as humans can comfortably sit in a room and watch TV. What's extraordinary is that they are watching themselves and grumbling about it.

James Cromwell, an American actor, does an excellent job adding flesh, blood, and a loud voice to an otherwise vertical shadow that is the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen's husband, who is apparently a greater influence than one might think of a shadow.

Michael Sheen superbly depicts Tony Blair--a favorite communicator on par with Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan.

So the movie essentially says the Queen and her family are humans and they made a mistake. But what's important is how this mistake is characterized and why it needed to be rectified. The mistake was that the Queen failed to understand and empathize with her people: her job. It needed to be rectified because of fear that the English monarchy maybe abolished (the film quotes Blair to have said one fourth of that country wants it that way). The fear itself stems likely from the fear of no income to maintain a lifestyle befitting royalty.

I was once told that the reason English people tolerate the monarchy is because they bring in more money into the UK than they take out. It is, in essence, a marketing tool for the island nation. Perhaps with the Queen this is true. I have a hard time believing it will continue to be so after her. Their 40,000-acre backyard might bring in more income. I also read somewhere p. Charles is a good gardener--that might help.",1179619200,,1954,4.619596541786744
1561895,5,B00005JPAM,"It's true what everyone says - this is a fantastic movie.  The choice to put Helen in as the Queen was superb.  She does a brilliant job and sometimes you almost can't believe that she isn't the real Queen.  Tony Blair was also really well cast and the actor did a fantastic job in looks and voice.

It doesn't always show the Queen in good light.  She made some poor decisions after Diana's death.  She took her sweet time in addressing the public and she didn't lower the flag at the Palace among other things.  It shows some real footage from news bulletins and a little of the funeral prossesion and it kept William and Harry away from the spotlight (therefore keeping some of their privacy).

There is fantastic acting in this and one thing I really liked about this is that it gives you a semi real glimpse into the mysterious life of a bizzare family and what happened behind the scenes after the death of their former daughter-in-law, wife and mother.  I really liked it and I was glad to finally get around to watching it yesterday.  I can't believe it took me so long.  I highly recommend it.",1179619200,,1102,4.432835820895522

1561898,4,B00005JPAM,"THE QUEEN is first and foremost about Queen Elizabeth II, but it is also about Elizabeth, the person beneath the crown. To show us that person, it focuses on her reaction to the death of Princess Diana in 1997, and the media circus that followed. It was also about the complex relations between the House of Windsor and 10 Downing Street and their roles in the circus, as ringmasters, barkers, clowns, tight rope walkers, marks, and shills.

Though Lady Di looms large in this legend, she is seen only in documentary footage, in interviews, public appearances, and paparazzi shots. No actress even attempts to play her, but it speaks to the authenticity of Helen Mirren's Oscar winning performance that the real life footage blends in seamlessly when ever she is on screen. Mirren was totally believable as Her Royal Majesty. All the little details were correct, even down to how the Royal Corgis obeyed her. A pack of dogs comes tearing through the room, then, with a single command from Her Royal Majesty; they all turn on a dime simultaneously. She had that authority in her voice, that certainty that her orders would be carried out.

The second most important character in this story was newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Michael Sheen played him quite well, capturing his vibration, aided by an uncanny physical resemblance. He might have overdone the bright eyes--like a portrait of a Prime Minister as painted by Keene--but the slight exaggeration didn't spoil the over all effect. Besides achieving peace in Ireland, his role in stage managing Princess Diana's funeral may have been his finest hour. His popularity certainly soared after he declared Diana ""The People's Princess.""

The film shows us the complex relationship between Blair and The Queen, and both their spouses have much smaller roles, but provide little flashes of insight into the characters of the two principles. James Cromwell gives a strong performance as Prince Phillip, and was totally believable as he climbed into the royal bedchamber, saying ""move over, cabbage."" So much for royal protocol. Tony Blair's wife was skeptical of the whole concept of monarchy, so she was a good foil, kind of a devil's advocate, if you will, for Tony Blair to express his growing admiration for the Queen, and the institution of the monarchy.

Alex Jennings played Prince Charles, and though he was not nearly ugly enough--not saddled with the features of a horse--nevertheless, gave a good performance, almost making you feel sympathy for him. Missing in Action were William and Harry, the heir and the spare. They are rarely seen, and then only glimpsed, but this was a very tasteful choice by director Stephen Frears, and script writer Peter Morgan. Just one of many choices that make for a wonderful, well rounded film experience.

Finally, I must mention the magnificent stag, in a cameo performance, who may be only a symbol, but a potent one, and one who illuminates just how the Queen always tries to keep a stiff upper lip, no matter what emotions are storming below.",1179532800,3,3051,4.9628180039138945

1561949,3,B00005JPAM,"Even though it's one of the finest movies I've seen in recent years, I've decided not to add to the bountiful array of positive comments about ""The Queen"" as a film.  It is everything its admirers say it is, and more- no problem there.  What IS problematic is the DVD version, specifically its sound balance.  Much of the dialogue is very soft, so naturally one compensates by turning up the volume on the TV.  That works only until Alexandre Desplat's gorgeous score begins to be played; the music booms so loudly that it is physically uncomfortable to hear.  I spent much of my viewing of ""The Queen"" with one wary finger on the volume button of my remote, adjusting it way up for dialogue scenes, and way down for music.  It seems to me that the sound mix is terribly off.  If this mix worked in theatres, it's not working so well on home video, and needs to be re-mixed.  In addition, the extras are more than a bit lacklustre.  There's a fine interview with Helen Mirren, a few more with the cast and crew, and a couple of nice commentary tracks, one of which is by Robert Lacey, the best-known of the Queen's unofficial biographers.  But that's pretty much it.  There's very little about the ""making of"", which would have been fascinating, given that the film so convincingly portrays locations that could not actually be used, like Balmoral.  Again, the film itself is extraordinary- the kind of thoughtful, heartfelt piece of film-making one sees all too seldom in this day and age.

I KNOW that when Diana died the COLD BLOODED SHREW of a Queen was upset at her vacation  being interrupted with the funeral arrangements that nothing but homosexuals and glitterati would attend, Elton John was mentioned, not a single tear was shed. Matter of fact the movie portrays that Queen Elizabeth was more dismayed at a 14 point stag being killed on her Balmoral estate by a commercial 'stock broker' hunter, than the violent death of her ex-daughter-in-law!

Matter of fact this COLD BLOODED SHREW of a Queen, I know I should let you know how I really feel, could not shed a singe tear for Diana she was practically catatonic and weeping like Niagara when the British Navy retired her damned royal yacht the 'Brittanica' ... I saw it in the flesh!

Helen Mirren portrayed Queen Liz ... well fabulous is an understatement! She did deserve and academy award...

Now the twofer was Micheal Sheen .... no no not one of the US Sheen family ... google it OK ... who played Tony Blair.

1561957,4,B00005JPAM,"Princess Diana has just died in a terrible car accident, all of London mourns, what exactly should the royal family do, especially when it is well known Diana and Queen Elizabeth II did not get along? According to the Queen, the royal family should show reserve. It is a private matter. Not to mention the issue involving Diana's children. They should not be exposed to the media and the circus which surrounds the situation. No emotion should be shown. A sort of stiff upper lip mentality. That is after all, what Americans think of when we think of the British, isn't it?

 There is a scene fairly early in the picture when Queen Elizabeth II break down and sheds tears. The camera never shows us her face. The Queen would never express such feelings in public, it simply would not be decent, so the camera man and director Stephen Frears give her, her space.

 It is because of moments such as this that make ""The Queen"" seem a bit too real. It is a docudrama but somehow it feels like a documentary, we know it's not, but the movie, especially screenwriter Peter Morgan, seem to know too much. How did they acquire this information? This is what I became most impressed with as I watched ""The Queen"".

 If you haven't heard ""The Queen"" tells the story of how the royal family treated the public outcry concerning Princess Diana's death and the relationship between the Queen and the newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair, whom many felt correctly judge the public's ""mood"" in how to handle the tragic accident.

 Much praise has been thrown Helen Mirren's way for her performance in the film, and she is quite good. Despite playing a real person Mirren doesn't give us an impersonation. She adds something more to the role, truly trying to flesh out the character (I say character because essentially that is what it is. This is a work of fiction despite everything). Some might say Mirren isn't doing much, there is too much restraint. They have a point, but, that's the way the character is presented to us. It is how this character would behave. Therefore it cannot be considered a fault. Instead it is an asset. A tribute to Mirren's performance.

 But Mirren isn't the only performance worth watching or talking about. The entire cast, from Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, to James Cromwell as Prince Philip and Alex Jennings as Prince Charles. Each actor makes us believe they are the characters they are playing. Cromwell, while a bit more emotion (usually expressing anger) gives the some kind of subtle performance as Mirren. Each character required the same approach.

 But is there more than meets the eye to Frears' film? Maybe. Would it be out of line to suggest ""The Queen"" is really about Britain's class system? Blair, who won an election based on the assumption he would offer change and fight for the middle-class is constantly at odds with the Queen, as she represents the ""establishment"", the exact people Blair was voted in to take on. But Blair serves as buffer. His character is designed to show us both sides. Without one side, the country would be lost. Gone would be it's history and tradition and without the other, gone would be optimism. The two need each other.

 Frears for his part he does a great job balancing all of this and gives the film just the right pace. ""The Queen"" never overstays her welcome. While not one of my favorite directors, he has nonetheless directed many entertaining films, which also take on class systems (""Dirty Pretty Things"", ""The Grifters"") but here I think he has outdone himself. This is one of his very best works!

 Bottom-line: A docudrama that presents itself as a documentary. At times we wonder, how do the filmmakers know this stuff? All of the performances are pitch perfect, with no one stepping over anyone else's toes. High recommended film!",1179014400,4,3820,4.730421686746988

The story takes place in the week after Prncess Diana's tragicly premature death in a 1997 Paris automobile crash and leads up to her public funeral.

A royalist I've slowly become.  G-d Save the Queen!  And all that.  In Great Britain, the Queen is a constitutional monarch of a country without a written constitution, yet America's rightful authors and originators of its ideals were probably nameless Anglican professors at King's College, which is now called Columbia University in New York City.  They were probably royalists too, no doubt.

When I saw that the movie's plot would have a lot to do with Princess Diana's death a few years back, I thought I wouldn't like the movie very much, the movie entitled ""The Queen"" should be about The Queen and no one else.  The movie thankfully lives up to its name.  Despite my preconceived notions, I've watched this twice already and think it has not only entertainment value but educational and historical value as well.

One of America's forefathers said,  ""A man of real merit is never seen in so favorable a light as through the medium of adversity.""  In this movie, the Queen's adverse circumstances were republican/anti-monarchical forces at work which probably in reality used Princess Diana as a pawn in their game.  I think her brother, Earl Spencer got it right when he said the Press killed her.  My favorite scene in this film was the one with the little girl giving Queen Elizabeth some flowers as the Royal family stopped to read the multitude of notes left among the sea of flowers outside the gates of Buckingham Palace.  This movie also portrays the Queen's relationship with her tenth Prime Minister Tony Blair as being a dynamic one which energized, transformed the monarchy into its present state.

Watch also the video clip of Helen Mirren.  I also was sceptical of what she could say, but was pleasantly surprised.  She deserved the Award for Best Actress, and I do agree the movie and other actors deserve kudos as well.  I personally would not mind having this movie among my worldy goods...

1562042,4,B00005JPAM,"I have to confess, I have mixed feelings about this film. On one hand, Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II is nothing short of stunning, and is much deserving of the Oscar and all other awards bestowed upon her... The script, however, left me a bit flat. It seemed rather conventional and TV-movie-of-the-weekish, and rather insular as well. Screenwriter Peter Morgan assumes a great deal from his audience, most of all that we have already shared in the media mania that surrounded Princess Diana, and are all well steeped in the twists and turns of her life story, and in her relationship to the royal family. Of course, millions and millions of people are well-versed in the minutae of that story, but for those of us who were casual and neutral observers, this movie does a poor job explaining what transpired, and the significance of various events and personal histories. A great deal of familiarity with the royal family is taken for granted, and we are expected to know their personalities -- the steadfast Elizabeth, the dithering Prince Charles, the bigoted Prince Philip. We're also expected to know their place in the national psyche of Great Britain, and to really feel the dramatic heft and social significance of the commoners rebelling against the old-world propriety of the nobles. In many regards, it's amazing that this film played as well as it did to the American audience... I suppose it's due to two factors, the enduring tabloid appeal of the late Diana, and to Helen Mirren's masterful performance. It's an impressive bit of acting, buoyed by other first-class actors... Bravo, Ms. Mirren... On to bigger and greater triumphs!",1178496000,6,1664,4.989208633093525
1562043,5,B00005JPAM,"This really is a very good movie and I think Helen Mirren is wonderful in this performance.  Frankly, I prefer her portrayal of this Elizabeth to her fine performance of the first Elizabeth.  Of course, this is a more personal and private story and it is the intimacy without all the accoutrements of history that I enjoyed so much.

I suppose it helps to have at least a passing understanding of the British system of government, its society, and the function of the Queen and the Royal Family.  If you are a thoroughgoing Republican (in their sense - that is anti-monarchist) you probably cannot work up much interest or sympathy for the Queen and much of what the movie offers will simply not be available to you.  So, I hope you can see her as a woman, a real person, who is in this position in her government and in history.  Notice how she came to the throne as a very young woman (only talked about, but not shown in the movie - but can be found on the BBC website).

The story centers around the events of the coming to power of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) as Prime Minster and the death of Princess Diana.  The Queen, being raised during more austere times, particularly the furnace of the Second World War, did not believe in public displays of emotion or grieving.  Add to that the fact the Diana was really no longer a member of the Royal Family when she died.  It was felt that her death was a private affair.  The Queen and her family are steeped in tradition and were following its protocols perfectly.  They in no way were intending to minimize or insult Diana's memory.  Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is quite supportive of tradition and the Queen, but seems quite oblivious to the world outside the grounds of Balmoral or the other palaces.

What they did not appreciate was the way the public had taken Diana to its collective heart.  She was a celebrity even more than royalty and the public felt a loss that required the Queen to participate in a new way.  According to the movie, it was Tony Blair, with some help by Prince Charles (Alex Jennings), who played the key role in helping them understand this new requirement.  It was actually a new and heavier burden the public placed on the Royal Family, but the public did not and does not care.

I especially liked the way Tony Blair grows in appreciation for Elizabeth and the way she fulfills her role.  The pressures of being Prime Minister almost certainly contributed to that appreciation.  A key scene is when his staff is bashing the Queen yet again and Blair has had enough and sets them straight about the appreciation they should have for her.

The most touching scenes are when the Queen is driving her Land Rover around her estate wearing her royal scarf over her hair and being as close to a normal person as she can ever be.  Fascinating.  Another touching scene is her appearance outside the gate viewing the huge displays of flowers and notes the public left for Diana outside Buckingham Palace.  The Queen maintains her public dignity as she reads some very insulting remarks about her and her family, but we know how much this wounds her.

The filmmakers have woven actual footage of the actual events into the movie itself and it is amazingly well done and does add to the sense of immediacy of the story.  Anyone who remembers the actual events will still be drawn in by the movie's Tony Blair talking within footage that is matched carefully to the surrounding actual footage contemporary to Diana's death.

The Queen takes place after the election of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the days leading up to and immediately following the death of Princess Diana.

The movie basically gives us a behind-the-scenes view of the royal family at this time.  It does this by intercutting archival video footage with the actors to enable you to follow the story, and give you some sense of why the family reacted the way they did.

Some people say that this movie was more sympathetic to Queen Elizabeth II.  However, I believe that this is just a balanced telling of the story, the director wished to tell.  I believe no judgments can be made.  This movie was another showcase for Helen Mirren, and she deserved the Oscar that she won.",1178409600,3,884,4.701298701298701

Not that we didn't know what the dysfunctional royal's thought of the ""People's Princess"" beforehand.

Whatever your views on the British monarchy are, you have to admit that it's all about image and perception.  An exspensive image that the British taxpayers seem to be stuck with like the debt we bare here.  Prince Philip and Prince Charles come off as clowns in the movie, but thats no surprise.  Tony Blair as the new ""modernist"" PM, well he's about to leave office so the least said on his l-o-n-g term the better.  As for the Queen, well this movie serves her quite well.  Certainly it boosts her PR and celebrity rating.  And you find yourself asking, what happens when she steps down.  Who are we stuck with then?

Stephen Frears on a very limited budget, has delivered a first class depiction of the royal's world and how they function under crisis.

I nestled down into the comfy seat with my milkduds and diet coke and prepared to take a nap as soon as the lights went dim, but I was delightfully surprised.

The acting was first rate and both Michael Sheen and Helen Mirren were exemplary in every way. The most touching moment of the movie was the scene where the queen goes off to grieve privately, in the solitude of the countryside. That scene (and the rest of the movie) is both poignant, memorable and beautifully acted.

The real footage of Princess Di was nicely woven into the film, as was the story line. And despite having seen (and read) voluminous amounts of news about her untimely death, this movie showed her passing from a wholly different angle and gave me a new perspective on the whole sad affair.

One of the interesting benefits of this flick is it shows with great clarity the relationships (and interrelationships) between the Prime Minister, Parliament, the Queen and her staff.

The amazing thing is how she can wear the royal facade so convincingly while also giving glimpses of the person underneath it. She's a great actress, in this and many other roles.

What I find particularly striking about this performance is that I actually come away with a more sympathetic picture of the Queen. Yes, more sympathetic. Helen Mirren and the director somehow make it clear that the Queen is burdened, shaped, empowered and trapped by the role she was born into. She was never allowed to be a regular person; yet she is a regular person, even as she's bought into notions of her god-given station in life. All very complicated, and interesting.

That was the strength of this movie to me. All the stuff about how they responded to Diana's death isn't as substantively interesting.

I actually thought that the Tony Blair character was better acted than the Queen character acted by Helen Mirren. (BTW, I think Meryl Streep got robbed of another Oscar). The Queen's character is flat and one-dimensional and as the viewer, one cares nothing about her so-called internal struggles.

The cinematography was nothing special, the score was practically nonexistent and definitely forgetable, and the MTV-like connecting of real television images and the actors was not a smooth and seamless presentation.

1562110,5,B00005JPAM,"Saw the film in the theaters, bought the (pricey) DVD when it came out. That's because this film is especially well-crafted by all the participants.

Helen Mirren goes as an actress all the way down into her body to come up with perfect pitch.

Jim Cromwell as Prince Phillip understands perfectly what a rotter, and how utterly damaged as a human being, Prince Phillip is. Chap who plays his son has the tension in the family, and the POW's inability to break through the ""enchanted glass"" of a family romance, upon which rests such a weight of memory, down pat.

The phrase ""The Enchanted Glass"" is from an excellent book by Tom Nairn about the subconscious of monarchy, and the way that Britain is more or less stuck with it absent a disaster such as happened to the Hapsburgs.

Mirren and Cromwell document the passing of an era dominated by the unadmittedly fearful shadow of what had happened to Britain and Britons in WWII and the long years after of rationing and the end of Empire.

The film documents a moment of hope which was reversed when Britain realized that its financial markets, and hence its foreign policy, were in thrall to the USA and went roaring in the old style into Iraq.

To its credit the film does not document a transformation in Elizabeth so much as a moment of greatness when the ""real"" Queen realized the truth of Charles de Gaulles' advice to her when young, and this was to realize that she was in for a life sentence, and thereby to understand that a Constitutional monarch's lot is not a happy one. She had to represent the gay men and the fat chaps sleeping on the streets, she had, in a minor key, to imitate Emperor Hirohito when he got on the radio to say that ""Japan must endure the unendurable and suffer the insufferable"" in 1945.

She had to surrender to time and change, and a Britain no longer in thrall to the posh alone.

She realizes how dismayed her father was when his own elder brother bugged out in 1937 and how the stresses of being George VI may have killed her Dad, who smoked himself to death.

The film is an elegant lesson in the meaning of the unwritten British constitution, right down to the strange way in which hierarchies parallel each other, with Blair's men meeting with court flunkeys who spend two hours arguing the merits of a gun carriage as an hearse for a Princess no longer, don't y'know, a Princess.

What we need next is a film treatment of the Princess who here appears only as herself in film clips, but Parliament needs to pass a law that a certain Madonna Ciccione from the USA is not to be allowed anywhere near the casting couch for that role: I say this because that woman, who is talented in certain regards but not in others, destroyed filmdom's chances to bring Evita Peron to life on the silver screen. Elton John in drag, or any number of gay chaps, would do a better job as Princess Diana in the same way boys played Cleopatra in Shakespeare's day.

This treatment may start up as a Broadway and West End musical but if you ask me, only first-rate actors and writers should be allowed anywhere near this subject. The tastefulness of The Queen shows what happens below blockbuster level where the makers of the film aren't bullyragged as they are in movies aimed at 14 year olds.

A xenophile can see a ""foreign"" film (although British films are not really all that ""foreign"" to Americans save self-moronized Texans) and get all patriotic for the wrong country: this happens to the sensitive chap in watching the Gance Napoleon. I can only hazard that this film will manufacture consent to the (relatively) harmless, if rather pricey, institution of the Monarch, although it gives some time, but short shrift, to Cherie Blair's Jacobite sympathies.

The moral is don't fix it if it isn't broke, and the adventure of Iraq demonstrates that flawed institutions should never be replaced unless absolutely necessary.",1178064000,2,3901,4.619942196531792
1562111,5,B00005JPAM,"""Go ahead, admit it. Between the kerchiefs and the corgis, the sensible clothes and the semi-detached smile, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has never been mistaken for the most dramatic monarch in the world, never given much of a hint that there might be a Major Motion Picture in her life. But this immovable object has met the unstoppable force that is actress Helen Mirren, one of the great masters of modern screen acting. In a commanding performance that is as compelling as it is unexpected, she has turned ""The Queen"" into something you never imagined it could be: a crackling dramatic story that's intelligent, thoughtful and moving.""
Kenneth Turan

Helen Mirren is extraordinary. Not only does she have the ability to take on the appearance of Elizabeth II, The Queen, she is able to reveal in small bits and pieces the humanity of Elizabeth II. Helen Mirren has said that in portraying a living person she imagines that person as a masterpiece painting. She is then able to take the brush and paint as she sees fit.

The underlying story is the week the 'People's Princess', Diana dies. Tony Blair, as played by Michael Sheen, has been elected the new Prime Minister. Sheen's performance is sensational. He msut tell The Queen that she is mishandeling the death of Diana. At their first meeting the Queen has reminded Mr Blair, he is her tenth Prime Minister, and he needs to live up to the likes of Winston Churchill. And, this becomes Prime Minister Tony  Blair's fulfilling moment. Diana and The Queen had always been at odds. The Queen wore her emotions tightly locked up  and Diana wore her emotions on her sleeve.  Prince Phillip, as played by James Cromwell is aloof and distant and has no regard for the ex-Princess at all. The ploy to stay in Scotland at Balmoral Castle, for the children's sake does not work. The  public is clamoring for some statement from the Queen.  The Queen asks advice of the Queen mother played by Sylvia Syms, but she, too,has a stiff upper lip. Prince Charles, Alex Jennings, a more modern man, asks Tony Blair to speak to the Queen to provide a statement that is befittng the Princess.  A statement is prepared, but we can see the Queen has some misgivings. The public responds to the Queen's words.

""Helen Mirren's allure lies not in finding what's regal in every woman she plays, but in finding what's womanly in every royal."" Entertainment Weekly

I loved almost everyone in this movie. Prince Phillip not as much.  It was riveting at times and so revealing of the Monarchy that does not, can not, reveal its private nature. The movie is funny and touching in ways you can't predict. Stephen Frears as director, has completed a beautifully moving film, rich in detail. He uses real footage of the funeral and of Diana. We are finally allowed to see the real dignity in the Queen. The current state of the world is referenced when the Queen reminds Tony Blair that the 'people can turn',""one day, quite suddenly, the same thing will happen to you.""  I will never look at the real Queen Elizabeth II the same way again after seeing Helen Mirren's portrayal. This may be the greatest gift Elizabeth II could have received.
 Highly Recommended. prisrob 5-3-07

1562112,3,B00005JPAM,"""The Queen"" is only a portait of Queen Elizabeth.  That was established early on in the first scene when she is posing for the portait painter.  With that, we are warned that what follows is not going to be ""truth"" in as much as a biography or documentary.  It is the film's ""impression"" of the queen at a time when the monarchy was forced to accept the tragic events of Diana's death and to join with the rest of its subjects in grief.  Therefore, the portrait reminds us that the focus is squarely upon the Queen herself and no one else.  In spite of all the biographies about the British royal family, not one of them can be considered to have an authoritative perspective.  The Royal Family have endeavored for centuries not to allow daylight in upon the magic of monarchy.  They know that to do so would invite a host of trouble.  Such daylight upon magic would bring them all to Hector's and Hilda's, as Prince Philip stated in the fim.  It's a delicate balance that they must preserve.  So, what we get from this film is, as usual, merely an impression but certainly not the truth.  The stag motif, however, helps us to understand the message that lies beneath.

The stag is indeed an interesting additive, and it is the most intriging figure in the film.  Many viewers have interpreted the stag as a representation of Diana.  I can certainly understand the reasoning behind that interpretation.  However, let's go a little further into the stag motif.  If you miss the motif, you miss the connection.  I will say right now that the stag is not in fact Diana, but the Queen herself.  Why?  Let's review the number of times that verbal references to ""stag"" are made and that crucial time when the stag appears.

When the Queen walks down a long corridor at Balmoral to take a call from the Prime Minister, notice the stag heads mounted on the walls along that corridor.  The stag is therefore connected with ""monarchy"" or imperialism.

Just before the stag appears in the river scene, the Queen is sitting down.  She has had a car accident because she was driving too fast along a rocky road and is now stranded in the river.  She begins to cry.  Then she turns and sees the stag.  The Queen is an active deer stalker, and that is what has kept her in such good physical shape to this day.  She identifies with deer.  And in the scene when the stag appears, he seems to identify with her.  Both the Queen and stag establish eye contact with each other, hence the camera closeup on the stag as he gazes at her and she at him.  She calls him ""a beauty,"" because to her he is something ethereal, magical, and ""otherworldly"" just as monarchy is to the public.  The stag is a sacrificial figure in this scene, although the Queen does not quite see him as sacrifical at that point.  To her, he is ""a beauty"" only.  She will later learn what he represents to her.

After the princes hear of the news of their mother's death, Prince Philip encourages them to take out their anger on a stag that has been known to appear on the 40,000-acre property of Balmoral.  To Philip the stag is nothing more than a deer.  He never quite gets the significance of the stag's meaning.  When Philip tries to get the boys out in the fresh air for deer stalking, the stag managed to elude them.  The stag has wandered off to neighboring property.  He has left the Balmoral estate.

Later in the film, Prince Philip tells the Queen that the stag has been shot on neighboring property by a banker who had come out for a day's shooting.

The Queen drives over to the neighboring property to see the stag in the cleaning room.  There he hangs by his hind legs.  He has been decapitated, and that's an important point.  The caretaker tells the Queen that the stag is a 14-pointer, an ""imperial.""  It is there in that room that the Queen releases her emotions.  She hopes that ""he did not suffer much"" when the shooting party had to follow him for miles before finishing him off.  She begins to identify with the stag even more in this scene.  She understands that the stag has been sacrificed.  I think she now begins to see herself as a sacrifical object.  As she examines the stag's head on the table in the cleaning room, she touches the point on the stag's cheek where he has been wounded.  She identifies with the stag even more at this point.  She looks at the head, no doubt remembering all the beheaded kings and queens in the historical past, and she probably recalls how important it is to connect with her people at a time when she is so reluctant to do so.  The ""stag,"" as the Queen, is going to be brought down, but for a purpose.  And she learned that she had to modernize, to reinvent the monarchy in order to reconnect with her people with whom she had been so out of touch.

The Queen feels a connection with this stag, precisely at a time when she herself is being ""hunted and brought down"" by a citizenry who demands her presence in London for Diana's funeral.  She is finally brought to her knees when she is forced to deliver an address to the nation about Diana.  But she is not accustomed to demands.  She is as vulnerable as the stag.  She vainly tries to remain elusive at Balmoral but to no avail.

Like the stag and like Diana, the Queen is also a hunted figure by her subjects.

1562114,5,B00005JPAM,"While the acting and the story are mesmorizing, and Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen are perfect as the characters they play in the film, the story certainly displays what a total ditz the royal family is.  In an era where royalty is long out of vogue, the British royals seem not to have noticed.  They think they are beyond human beings.  The Queen cares less for Diana's tragic young death than for a poor stag that's been shot in the mountains.  She's either gone senile or she's batty.  Her husband is even worse as an arrogant, snob who makes crass remarks when he hears of Diana's death.

The fact that their son was responsible for the break up of his marriage to Diana because of his adulterous relationship with a married woman and his jealousy over Diana's raport with the people  shows an insensitivity on the royals part beyond belief.  In a family who should have held their spoiled son responsible for Diana's troubles, blamed him only for not keeping her feelings over his infidelity under wraps.  While the country was in grief, the royals snubbed them, looking down upon their so called subjects with no feeling whatsoever.  Charles was not the only one whose marriage broke up.  As I recall the Queen's sister was also divorced, and her other son, Andrew divorced Fergie, so they have little to be proud of in family matters.

It's a very good movie and a good reason to get rid of old time royalty.  They should disperse their unbelievabe billions in cash, land, homes and jewels and give it back to their people from whence it came and settle down in a cottage somewhere in the Scottish Highlands.  If they want to keep their mouths shut, and their lives separate from their countrymen, let them return  their wealth to the people and go away.",1177977600,2,1762,4.620578778135048

1562193,5,B00005JPAM,"This movie works on several levels.

As a semi-documentary, it reminds us of the tumult, the emotions of that sad time.

As a character study, it shows us sides of the royals we might never have glimpsed otherwise.  We see the stiffness of one prince, the caring of another, the entitlement felt by a queen mother, the insight of a prime minister.  And all of these are fresh to an American, removed from the daily exposure to royal watching.

But, for me, The Queen works best as a study of how people, regardless of station or rank, react to change and the pressure it places on humans. The subject is handled with subtlety and grace, but it is the focus of the film.  There is food for thought here, a rarity in current movie making.

1562194,5,B00005JPAM,"So what's this then? A biography of HRH?

Good heavens, no. She's been on the throne now for more than half a century. Where would a filmmaker begin? Besides, she looks like she's still got years of service ahead of her. Where would a fimmaker end? And with the greatest respect to Her Majesty, I really don't think a movie about her life would have quite the same draw. No, this interesting study, written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Frears, centres on the turbulent times - certainly for the monarchy - following on from the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.

Ah, yes. I remember those days well

Don't we all? I'll never forget that morning on August 31st 1997. I'd been at a house party with some friends and after a totally fun night of dancing to anything from Notorious B.I.G.'s ""Hypnotize"" to Whitney Houston's ""I'm Every Woman"", we all staggered out into the dawn light to hear people chatting nervously, almost fearfully, about something. Princess Diana has been seriously hurt in an accident in Paris, someone eventually said out loud in shocked disbelief. Stunned, we all got into the car and immediately turned on the radio to hear that it was true. By the time I finally made it home and turned on the TV, her death had already been confirmed.

So, a documentary then?

Well, not quite, though this fantastic movie is almost documentary-like, with its well placed news clips, presented and voiced by broadcasters we all know and respect here in the UK. In actuality, it is part recent history and part clever speculation. Its main focus seems to be the gross miscalculation made by the royal family immediately following the tragedy. They seemed very remote, very aloof and while we see actual footage of world leaders like Presidents Clinton and Mandela were making public statements of grief and shock in this movie, Queen Elizabeth II and her family remain resolutely silent.

As you mentioned earlier, it wasn't a good time for the monarchy.

No, it definitely wasn't. The monarchy's popularity in Britain plummeted to its lowest levels in centuries in the autumn of 1997, while conversely, Tony Blair, the freshly minted prime minister came out of it all smelling of roses. By 2002 though, when the Queen celebrated her Golden Jubilee, it seems her subjects had forgiven her. Maybe we saw the big picture and were not going to allow one mistake, no matter how big, to obliterate 50 years of outstanding and selfless service. Or maybe, in this tabloid media driven age of fickle celebrity, we've just developed much shorter memories. Whatever.

So who's in it then?

Ah, yes, of course. Well, Helen Mirren gives the performance of a lifetime as The Queen and after years of admiring her work, I'm so happy to see her finally get her due: Golden Globe, Bafta and Oscar. She graciously said it was The Queen that people were honouring but we all know it was her performance as The Queen and her incredible talent in general. Martin Sheen carries off the role of Tony Blair pretty amazingly as well, even though the resemblance is fleeting at best. James Cromwell - remember him from ""Six Feet Under""? - does a remarkable impression of Prince Philip and don't forget to check out Helen McCrory as Cherie Blair. She doesn't seem to be a huge fan of the Royal family, does she? (Of course, as I mentioned earlier, most of this movie is pure speculation).

But we were all there at the time. It was almost ten years ago. What's the huge attraction now?

I think that is what makes this movie so fascinating. For me anyway. It's about a time in recent history that I lived through and still remember quite clearly. I didn't go as far as some did, with all their weeping, wailing and shaking outside Kensington Palace but I was very sad about Diana's death.

But most crucial of all, I think, this movie is sympathetic towards the Queen and shows us a (possible) side to her that we never get to see. Helen Mirren plays her with great warmth and depth and we see, probably for the first time, just why she may have reacted in the way that she did back then. The entire movie suggests a side to the story that we weren't privy to and probably never will be and I think that's why the movie went down a storm here in the UK. It also reminds us how we all lost the plot for a minute back there in September of 1997. That's the fun part - being able to see something and shout: Oh, I remember that! What were we thinking? The good old days.

As for why Americans have taken to it, I can only speculate. Royalty has always been something of a fascination for our cousins and remember that this tale of The Queen is circled by or entangled with somewhat, the story of Diana, a woman who still enthrals on both sides of the Atlantic even now, 10 years after her untimely death. I saw a 2-hour special about Princess Diana's life on the Biography channel recently. Even though I was relatively familiar with the story, I was still gripped from beginning to end. A movie about her life... now THAT I would pay good money to see!",1177804800,4,5042,4.5703211517165006

1562196,5,B00005JPAM,"During the Middle Ages, the pope was the person that kings did not offend lightly. The English King, Henry II, was flogged for his role in the death of Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury. The German emperor, Henry IV, had to march around the papal palace in sack cloth and ashes for his misdeeds. Ironicaly, the Queen is the head of the Church of England but she has to answer to an authority even more capricous and mercurial than popes...public opinion as shaped by superficial celebrity-worshipping media coverage. People love hero/bad guy stories so when Princess Di died, the press was busy turning her into a saint and the royal family into cads. Never mind the complicating factors that there had been a very nasty recent divorce with Di running to the press spilling out intimate details of their lives that we had no business knowing, the public wanted to see the Queen blubber and cry on TV like some guest on the Jerry Springer show. I have a feeling Queen Elizabeth would have gladly traded penances with Henry II and been flogged at the tomb of Thomas Becket instead.  Elizabeth came from a generation that valued emotional restraint in the face of calamity. When John Kennedy died, the thing everyone praised was Jackie's calm dignity. Nowadays, she would have been scorned as a cold fish for not throwing herself screaming on the casket. The movie explored these generational tensions very well. Mirren was perfect in the role.",1177718400,7,1444,4.82258064516129
1562197,4,B00005JPAM,"I wasn't surprised when Helen Mirren was nominated for an Oscar for this film, nor was I surprised when she actually won the Oscar. Her performance was clearly (from the previews) Oscar bait, but what did surprise me was the film gaining an Oscar nod for Best Picture. Even though it had a future Oscar winning performance, was directed by Stephen Frears (who directed one of my favorite films ""Dangerous Liaisons), it didn't seem like it would be that good. Having now watched it, I still hold to the fact that it is not that good. The film has its merits and deserved its nomination for Best Original Screenplay, but Best Picture is stretching it quite a bit. I feel that ""Notes on a Scandal"" should've got the Oscar nomination spot that this film took. Anyway, Mirren plays Queen Elizabeth with Michael Sheen playing the recently appointed Prime Minister Tony Blair. Not long after The Queen accepts Blair as Prime Minister, Diana Spencer the former Princess of Wales dies in a car crash with her boyfriend Dodi Fayed. The world, not just Britain, are shocked by the news of Diana's death and is even more shocked when The Queen and her staff virtually refuse to even acknowledge the death. As her popularity suddenly drops and The Queen struggles to rule her monarchy with dignity, Blair all but takes her place as the main character...Even giving Diana the nickname ""the people's princess."" Judging by the synopsis, it seems that the movie is an attack on The Queen...And for the first half of the movie, I was thinking that it was. It's not. It's a depiction of how The Queen struggled to rise above her own values and still please her people. I doubt this movie would have been as successful as it was, had it not been for Mirren because she's really the person that carries the film. In a movie that is filled with great performances, including from James Cromwell, Michael Sheen also turns in a winning performance. I'm surprised he wasn't able to score an Oscar nomination. ""The Queen"" is not a bad film, but I certainly wouldn't rank it as one of the top 10 best films of 2006. It is, however, a short and worth watching film with a terrific performance from its leading lady.

1562198,5,B00005JPAM,"Always having been fascinated by the Royals, (especially Princess Dianna)

I really enjoyed this movie.

It is centered at the time that the Princess died, and the Queen came under such negative scrutiny for her lack of emotion, and her failure to make a public statement about her death.

Although I am not saying that the Queen was right in her silence, I DO now have a clearer understanding of Royal tradition,and protocol. I now understand her silence a little better.

Even though the Queen clearly did not like her ex Daughter-in-Law, It still was/is not customary to show one's feelings in public in the Royal family.

Viewing this film brought the period of Diana's death back like it was yesterday, and I liked how they added live footage of her throughout the film. Like millions of others, I admired the Princess, and will watch this film many times to come.

Also, I now have a new respect for the Queen. This really is a wonderful movie!",1177632000,3,950,4.658682634730539

Instead of the cardboard cliches you see in so many film biographies, this movie takes one short--yet totally life altering--period in a historical figure's life (Queen Elizabeth) and as a result it is more revealing than most films that try to portray a full life.  The script deserves much praise for it many nuances.  Especially touching was the metaphor of the hunted animal on the Queen's estate.  Helen Mirren is simply wonderful.  Her performance has many moments of subtle brilliance--often conveyed with delicate facial expressions--breaking through the mask--reacting to the complicated situations she is faced with.  I think this film has done a lot for the real Queen's reputation.  It humanizes her in a totally realistic but sympathetic light.

But at the same time, I don't see why those who choose not to flaunt their emotions in public should be judged so harshly for it.

Otherwise:  James Cromwell does nicely as Prince Phillip, as does the fellow playing Tony Blair.",1177632000,,652,4.684210526315789
1562201,4,B00005JPAM,"Sometimes it's hard to watch a movie that receives large amounts of praise. You always feel like your less-than-enthusiastic view of the film will have people proclaiming that you ""didn't get it and missed the point"". In the case of the Queen, I felt like it centered on an intriguing time, it had excellent performances yet at the same time, I felt it did have some issues that kept bugging me and while I will recommend the film, it just has too many aspects to it that dragged it down.

It's the end of August 1997 and new Prime Minister Tony Blair, a kind of modernizer who wants to change some of Britain's established rules, is a kind of fish out of water when it comes to etiquette around Queen Elizabeth II. However tragedy strikes when Diana, Princess of Wales, is killed in a car crash in Paris. The country and the world mourns while the Royal Family remains in their palace without so much as public appearances or issuing statements, preferring to keep it a private matter and not sensationalizing it. The British tabloids have other ideas as they deem it insensitive and stoic so Blair tries to convince the Queen to at least do something in the public before they decide the monarchy is unneeded.

After watching the Queen, 2 things struck me: 1) the huge scrutiny that happens in the British Press and their brutal stories that make the paper and 2) everyone acted really well but the film just didn't sit well with me. Helen Mirren is of course fabulous as the Queen and balances that line between going over-the-top primadonna and unemotional mannequin. When she finally breaks down, she's facing away from the camera as if to say even we aren't allowed to see even an actress playing the Queen cry on-screen. Another highlight was Michael Sheen, playing Tony Blair, who infuses him with a kind of real-world sensability since he's obviously clueless about mannerisms around royalty. Of course the big question is did he really want the Queen to look more favorably to the public or use it as a kind of publicity factory. Who knows. The only one I felt didn't click with me was Prince Charles, Diana's ex. He almost feels opportunistic, like he tries to make things look better in his favor. Maybe it was just me.

The other flaw I felt it had was a sense of a pacing and repetitive tone. Of course it's a character study but in films, there's usually things characters do to bide time and make the scenes feel intriguing. Here, characters just...talk, and not the kind of meaningful talk it should've had. And after awhile you start to notice characters kind of repeat themselves too much in scenes. The Queen tries her hardest to be sympathetic without giving in to changing values, Blair is concerned at the lack of statements from the monarch while Queen's husband expresses non-supportive news in regards to Diana, her attention and what the public wants. After awhile it feels what a friend calls egg-like: whether it's sunny-side up or scrambled or over-easy, it's still egg in the end. Weird analogy I know.

So is it worth a watch? Well many people will enjoy it but for me, I felt it was a well-made but kind of flawed film. Commence ""you didn't get it"" remarks.",1177632000,5,3190,4.64070796460177
1562264,5,B00005JPAM,"I truly enjoyed this movie, Helen Mirren has done an excellent job of portraying Queen Elizabeth II. This movie and another movie, ""Bertie and Elizabeth,"" would make the perfect gift for anyone who loves the British Royal Family!",1177632000,,229,5.052631578947368
1562265,5,B00005JPAM,"THE QUEEN is a terrific movie. It's one of those rare films that is about a subject that seems mind-numbingly boring but manages to be engrossing and even somewhat suspenseful. The week following the death of Princess Diana found the entire world's eyes on Buckingham Palace and its residents, and this fictionalized version of events seems entirely plausible and utterly fascinating.

Helen Mirren obviously won the lion's share of awards (over thirty, including the Golden Globe, SAG Award and Oscar) for her leading role as HM Queen Elizabeth II. Even though I would rather have seen Kate Winslet (LITTLE CHILDREN) or Penelope Cruz (VOLVER) win the Academy Award, Mirren was excellent in displaying the passions and fears of a woman infamous for her stoicism. Her accent is spot-on (Americans have a hard time telling the difference from one British accent to another) and she looks just like her. Her facial expressions are so acutely in tune with HM's inner life that they're almost too subtle to be noticed, but attentive viewers will marvel at her ability to move audiences without seeming to perform at all.

Director Stephen Frears deserves applause for making this film simultaneously witty and respectful. Though the film obviously assumes that HM Queen Elizabeth II had nothing to do with Diana's death (as many people believe), it's surprisingly even-handed, with many supporting players suspicious of HM and the Queen herself (not to mention her odious husband Prince Philip) expressing distaste for Diana.

THE QUEEN is well worth seeing for its splendid acting (Mirren and Michael Sheen [as PM Tony Blair] are the standouts) and extremely interesting story. Even strict anti-monarchists will find much to love.",1177632000,3,1726,5.201438848920863
1562266,5,B00005JPAM,"The Queen depicts The House of Windsor during one of its most tumultuous weeks: that which followed the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997. Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II does a magnificent job portraying the monarch's quandaries as she is faced with a challenge for which her forty five year long reign has not prepared her: how to deal with the sudden death of a former daughter-in-law who was deeply and uncharacteristically emotionally beloved by the British.

The film opens in May 1997 with the election of Tony Blair.  His visit to Buckingham Palace, accompanied by his republican-minded wife, is one of the funniest scenes in the film as Her Majesty gently but firmly puts him in his place: ""I'm the one who asks, Mr. Blair.""  Then the film turns darker as we see Diana's last summer in a photo montage, culminating in the paparazzi chase which led to the fatal car crash in Paris.  We relive the shock felt by the Royal Family, the Government, and the world as the news spread, and then we are led through the negotiations as Mr. Blair carefully helps the Queen recognize that her first reaction, to treat the death as a private family matter, is untenable in the face of deep national mourning.

There are many fine scenes in this film.  I am especially fond of the elk scene, where the Queen, stranded at Balmoral, gives way to some private tears.  I also love a brief moment of tenderness that crosses her face when she watches Charles telling his sons about their mother's death. (I am also impressed with how tactful the film's producers were in not showing close ups of William and Harry during that awful week).  Tony Blair's losing patience with his staff's sniping at the Queen and angrily  defending her is also very fine.  But the most moving moment comes when the Queen makes her way through the crowds at Buckingham Palace, feeling cold and rejected until the little girl hands her a bouquet saying ""They're for you."" That scene, and the following one as the women begin to curtsey, brings tears to my eyes. Finally, the Queen's  warning to Blair that he too will fall someday has a particularly ironic ring these days.

The DVD production is well made, but with few extras beyond an audio commentary and a featurette on the film's production.  Such a superb production needs little support, and I intend to rewatch The Queen many times.",1177632000,5,2370,4.6819277108433734
1562267,5,B00005JPAM,"My daughter and I watched this together and were impressed at the sensitive, polite performances depicting some high profile, very-much-alive characters. Not an easy task by any means.  Helen Mirren deserves her Oscar for her Elizabeth, a self-sufficient stiff-upper-lip but terribly out of touch monarch.  Her relationship to the Queen Mother is touching and tender and how she and Prince Philip maintain their marriage, one obviously built upon respect for the other, refreshingly candid.  Prince Charles appeared truly blindsided and deeply wounded over Diana's death and his only concern seemed to be for his children, and how Diana appeared to them in the end.  The tabloids and TV were forbidden to the children and wisely so; they'd lost their mother not a celebrity after all.  The movie well explains why the monarchy kept a low profile.  It had very much to do with family loyalty and the feelings of Diana's boys, whom Prince Philip adores and did his best to divert wholesomely through outdoor activities during that extremely difficult period. (The parallel between the hunt for the stag on the royal property and how Elizabeth felt hunted by the press struck me greatly.) Tony Blair's character depicted a conflicted man torn between plans for ""modernisation"" and the long-standing dignity of an increasingly antiquated monarchy.  In his off hours he's a loving family man who admires his intelligent wife, at work he treats his staff as equals intellectually and socially, and has the best interests of his nation, including the monarchy, at heart.  The footage of Diana and the public mourning brought great immediacy to the story. In the end, Elizabeth, despised and misunderstood, comes out to greet the people who accused her of such coldheartedness.  Mirren shines in these scenes.  She is truly magnificent and stalwart, and though she might not have approved of Diana's decisions and actions, we cannot fault her.  She is only human.",1177545600,,1955,5.155063291139241
1562268,5,B00005JPAM,"I wasn't sure what to say about Stephen Frears' Oscar-winning film, THE QUEEN, that had not already been seen.  The movie has played for months on end in San Francisco art theaters, but never once reached my local suburb, so it probably also never played in small towns across America.  That was my key, along with friends wanting MY personal take on this Best Picture Oscar nominee and Actress winner when it FINALLY got onto DVD.

For starters, Helen Mirren gives one of the great performances of all time and richly deserved the thousand awards she has gotten as Queen Elizabeth II.  But she could not do much if Peter Morgan's award-winning script were not as brilliant as it is; the same goes for Frears' magnificent direction.  The movie got Oscar-nominated in several major categories, including Picture and Direction and Actress; I would have added Production Design.  On a mediocre audio commentary, Frears and Morgan curiously ridicule and bad-mouth their own movie in terms of jokes and wrong locations because of a low-budget.  Actually, this is a very handsome-looking film in terms of sets and costumes.  So when you play this DVD, do ignore the Morgan and Frears audio commentary, and maybe try a second one with a British historian and royal family author.  Or just listen to the movie ""cold"".

What we have here is a fascinating and insightful drama about the week following Princess Diana's car crash death in 1997 Paris, as filtered through the perspective of the Royal family who are at Balmoral, their hideaway in the Scottish highlands (rich location filming).  Morgan's screenplay gives us a day-by-day portrait of the conflict between the Monarchs and the Blairs, Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Tony Blair (a marvelous Michael Sheen), fresh young blood versus a centuries-old conservative monarchy.  We observe, like flies on a wall, how the death of Diana is viewed by both the Queen and Tony.  The Blairs side with the British public, who adored Diana.  They want the flag over Buckingham Palace flown at half-mast, even though the Royal family is in Scotland for the week, and they want a public statement from the Queen.  As more and more flowers pile up outside Buckingham Palace, where people are holding a vigil all week and impatiently waiting for their queen to show herself, Elizabeth reads the various newspapers criticizing her.  She did not like Diana that much and views this as very much a private funeral.  THE QUEEN is rich in character more than plot.

Eventually, the public gets its wish for a flag at half-mast, a public TV statement by a queen who barely feels and coldly recites the words she is saying, and a walk among the thousands of people behind police barriers.  The loveliest scene, or at least my favorite, has a little girl giving the Queen a bouquet of flowers.  ""For me?"" she inquires softly.  ""Thank you,"" she says with true sympathy.  Mirren is just towering and flawless in her Oscar-winning role, reason enough to watch THE QUEEN.  But Sheen, and veteran Sylvia Sims and Oscar-nominee James Cromwell, are also excellent as the Queen Mother and Prince Philip, respectively.  The movie should also have gotten a Makeup Oscar nomination since Mirren is beautiful and sexy in real life and looks nothing like Elizabeth.  But with the right white wig and reading glasses and a soft accent, she IS the Queen.  (You might want to watch the film with the English subtitle captions turned on to catch all of the dialogue.)

The DVD for THE QUEEN is letterboxed at 1.85, middle-range wide-screen.  (There is also a pan/scan full screen version.)  Like I said earlier, it has two audio commentaries, and the one I played with the director and writer does the movie a real disservice by constantly pointing out all its flaws.  But there is also a very good and informative 20 minute filmmaking documentary and chat with the cast.  It got a PG-13 rating for ""brief language"" which bypassed me; I'd give the film a ""PG"" instead for all ages.

1562270,5,B00005JPAM,"At an early point in THE QUEEN, Prince Charles comments that the Princess Diana known to the royal family and the Princess Diana known to the people are two entirely different entities.  It is an astute observation, and much the same might be said of Queen Elizabeth II herself, a woman who has spent most of her life upholding the dignities, responsibilities, and duties of the crown regardless of her personal sentiments--and who has worked remarkably hard to keep those sentiments out of the public eye.

THE QUEEN focuses on the week following Princess Diana's fatal car crash, and Princess Diana's presence broods over the film in the form of actual news footage.  But THE QUEEN focuses on Elizabeth, and as presented here she is a woman whose life has been dominated by the discipline required of her office.  She has authority, wealth, and priviledge of such degree that it is far, far beyond the scope of all but handful to imagine, much less understand.  At the same time, however, she is a prisoner in a gilded cage; few moments are hers alone, and only her iron-clad will upholds her in the face of the demands of her office.

It not therefore surprising that upon Diana's death Elizabeth instantly sets aside her own emotions and moves forward inside the code of conduct that has dominated her entire life.  Even her concerns for her grandsons must take second place to the demands of her office, and in this instance she determines that the office demands the same stability she has always offered to her people: a calm and unruffled visage and adherence to the meticulous protocol that has shaped her entire life.  This proves a great miscalculation.  The public, enamored of Diana, interprets this as indicative of royal indifference.

Very little can be said of Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II which has not already been said.  It is brilliant and quite possibly unequalled in its recreation and interpretation of such a well-known and still-living figure.  It is perfectly balanced by Michael Sheen in the role of Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose habitual informality offers a perfect counter-balance, and the remarkable efforts of those cast as the royals: James Cromwell, Sylvia Syms, Alex Jennings, and Helen McCrory, who play Prince Philip, The Queen Mother, Prince Charles, and Cherie Blair respectively.  The tone of the film is cool, graceful, elegant, and indeed stately--and although this might have emerged as dull in other hands, it builds to a remarkable climax in the hands of Stephen Frears.

The one occasionally questionable note is the script by Peter Morgan.  In one sense, it is remarkably resourceful, managing to include considerable detail; in another, however, it is extremely obvious.  I was occasionally troubled by the thought that, had it not been fueled by the miraculous performances of the cast, it would have drifted into triteness.  This is particularly the case in terms of character shifts, which occasionally seem unexpected and which occasionally go nowhere in particular.

It would be interesting to know what the royals and the Blairs think of the film.  At present there has been--in typical Buckingham Palace style--little or no comment.  The Queen herself has only noted that, given that it focuses upon a particularly painful time, she has no desire to see it.  In terms of quality, the DVD is quite good without being dazzling.  Bonuses include a short and generally interesting, if not particularly deep, ""making of"" documentary and two audio commentaries: one by director Stephen Frears and writer Peter Morgan, which is good, and one by royal expert Robert Lacey, which is better still.  Strongly recommended.

It shows the effect her death had on the british empire and around the world.  I was one year out of high school and on my way to basic training in 1997, to immature and wrapped up in my own mind to understand the impact it had on people, yet watching this movie and seeing the live broadcasts it was touching you could feel it.
It deserves it's 6 oscar nominations and one win for Hellen Mirren who does an amazing job.
The queen also received 98% positve feedback on rottentomatoes of 166 reviews who can all write better than me.
Stephen Frears directs he also directed the grifters and high fidelity both with john cusack, both movies also received 4 stars from the grand pooba of critics roger ebert and made his personal top 10 lists the years they were released.  Roger Ebert being out due to surgery from salivary cancer still reviewed the queen and also gave it 4 stars last year.  You can tell Stephen frears being born in the UK had some fun with this as when Prince Philip tells queen Elizabeth ""move over cabbage"" when he jumps into bed.  His movie has a great flow and does a beautiful job with the buck and the queen in the woods which symbolizes Dianna as the queen tries to help it but in the end it was still hunted down by the trackers almost as Dianna was by the paparazzi.  He has a great eye for detail i believe i saw a playstation 1 or a supernintendo on Tony blairs tv set.
The movie does not take sides, and it shows us a side of a woman that nobody would get to see other than in a movie, and maybe help the way she is remembered.

Sort of like water to a goldfish, she's always been ""there"" but I never thought much about her.  Until Diana's death and then my focus was on Diana.  Now this film has switched my focus to the Queen.  Hmmm.

There's no doubt that Mirren's performance was superb and certainly Oscar worthy.  She's a classy lady and the class shows up here.  The one thing that worries me, though, is that she may have infused the character of Elizabeth with some of her own generous humanity, thus making her more friendly than she really is. I found myself much more sympathetic to her at the end of the film than I was in the beginning.  Even the doltish Prince Phillip seemed sort of harmlessly quaint and even humorous. Were these people really that nice?  Who knows?

I have found this to be a problem in many films---I loved John Lone as the Last Emperor of China but was the real emperor really that sweet?  Doubt it. Also, Sir Thomas More....After watching Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons, anyone would immediately vote for More's sainthood.  Yet, we read that the real Thomas had a dark side that the film doesn't show.

Like Marlon Brando's performance of the Godfather did a lot to glamorize  guys who probably were really an ugly bunch of thugs.

So....I think it's important to see these ""historical"" movies, enjoy them, but keep an open mind about the veracity of the characterizations.

1562344,4,B00005JPAM,"Should have been the Oscar winner for best picture -- it was by far the best and most involving movie I saw last year. Helen Mirren took best actress gold for her astonishing portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II, caught between worlds in the days following the death of Diana.

The DVD comes with two commentaries: an upbeat one on the production from director Stephen Frears and screeenwriter Peter Morgan, and another from Robert Lacey, an expert on the royal family. Lacey serves admirably as a translator for the folks in Region 1, who almost certainly missed many references whilst viewing the film in theaters. It's a highly recommended talk for admirers of the film who want an enriched  viewing experience the second or third time around.

The other extras are efficient but routine making-ofs. Mirren says she became comfortable in the role by thinking of herself as painting a portrait, a process in which the artist's role is to bring some of herself to the finished subjective work.

Video and audio on the standard DVD release are as you'd expect, sturdy and well-bred.",1177372800,7,1077,4.868852459016393
1562345,5,B00005JPAM,"There is one main reason to see this film: HELEN MIRREN! She's fabulous! I missed it in the theaters but it plays beautifully on a home screen - even my 27 inch one. The wide screen is not as wide as many others and so the picture shows up well.

Especially for baby boomers who remember watching the young Elizabeth being crowed Queen on a small black and white TV set in the early 1950s, this film shows us the mature and intelligent and yet cold looking monarch that she is. As we learn in the short 17-minute ""making of"" documentary, it was not Direct Frears concern that the actors playing Tony Blair and Prince Charles actually look or sound like the real characters. At first you miss Charles large ears but pretty soon you hear what is a good characterization of his voice.

On the surface this is a story of the tragic death of Princess Diana but, below that surface is the story of what it is like to be raised in a Palace and be cut off from the modern world.

There are two commentary tracks as well. One is by Direct Stephen Frears and talks about the making of the film. The other is by a British Historian who discusses the making of a Monarchy and Royal customs.

Most of all, however you will remember the great performance of Helen Mirren.

1562346,3,B00005JPAM,"This is a film about what politicians and celebrities ""owe"" the public and the media. The message of the film is that it is the duty of a public figure to give ""the people"" what they want even if it doesn't necessarly reflect the actual emotions of the person in question.

The film begins with the death of Princess Diana. Her death initiates a media circus and she is treated as a great person though in life she accomplished little other than getting lots of press coverage for herself. The politicians immediately make the rounds of the media programs, say all the right things and express the manipulative ""false"" emotions that press/public want to hear. But the royals themselves and especially the queen are not in front of the press making the expected over the top dramatic false emotional displays of ""grief"". They also don't immediately move back to the media center of London. In the film's view of things, these are ""bad"" things.

The film, like many people today, assumes that there is ""one"" right way to show the emotion of grief and that such displays need to be made in front of the Cameras as quickly as possible. The idea that individuals have different ways of expressing emotion is lost in the self-help fed culture of amature experts. Phillip, for scheduling activities to take the children's mind off the tragedy is made out to be a ""monster"". But who is really the monster? Is it a man who attempts to keep children away from a media circus or is it the people who want to feed those children into the media circus?

The queen and company not returning to London starts to ignite events in London. The press, unhappy at not getting the story they wanted, starts to fuel public opinion against the Queen. The politicians then start to see the unpopularity of the Queen as a drag on the popularity of their party and start putting pressure on. The people (and really the media as well) are demanding a public show of grief for Diana. The queen must give the people what they expect. The life and death of modern politics: Poll Numbers are dragged out as a reason why the Queen must make an over the top false public display of grief that she doesnt want to make. But she resists.

Meanwhlie, the media has stirred up the crazies that follow on the edges of celebrity. The film tries hard to convince us that unbalanced people who express ""grief"" by putting ""they (the royals) have your blood on their hands"" are somehow normal people. Diana was a divorced woman who died in a traffic accident in Paris. What kind of person blames the ex-mother in law in ""blood on your hands"" terms? Thats crazy-talk. And yet the film treats it as a real expression of public opinion.

More pressure is brought and finally the queen attempts to make a public statement herself. But in the most surreal moment of the film, the political PR people demand that the statement be rewritten so that the words ""sound human"". Incredibly, the film's message here is that a real message by a real human being sounds less human than text written by a bunch of Public relations hack writers.

We live in an age where public moments and public emotions are scripted. Where the words and feelings of real people don't sound human to many of us anymore and where we demand (as the film does) made-for-tv moments of false grief. And if we don't get them, the person responsible must be destroyed.

The Queen makes the statement. The media and press get what they want. The politicians get what they want. And ""the people"" seem to get what they want. But the question I was left with was why the statement was necessary. Why do public figures ""owe"" the media or ""the people"" anything?  And what especially do they owe the public emotional displays that are often false?

This film is a message film. It is blatently one-side and manipulative. It is all the worse because it uses real people who are still alive to make its points. Some people do extraordinarily well in the film as to their portrayal. Others are played almost as charactures.

The message the film wants to present is that the old ""out of touch"" royals need to modernize themselves. The message that the film unintentionally presents is that modern public life is entirely fake and driven by the stories the media decide to present. If you give the media the story they want, you are a good person and they will treat you well. If you don't give them what they want, they will fill the newsprint and airtime with attacks on you.

According to the film's thinking, the right reaction for a Queen on hearing of Diana's death would have been to rush off to consult public relations experts and get everyone in front of the TV cameras as quickly as possible. Regardless of real emotions, they should have acted out film or television movie ""grief"". Everything and every word would have been scripted and planned out with regard to media coverage day by day until the funeral.

The film might have been better if it had dealt with the broader implications of events and been less one-sided. But it didn't. The iconic moment of the movie is when the speechwriters come in to change the words of a real person to make them sound ""more human"". There is so much wrong with that, words fail.",1177027200,4,5236,4.588235294117647

Rather than taking the easy road and making Queen Elizabeth and the Royal Monarchy a target, this film chose to show both the new (Tony Blair) and the old (The Queen) in a fairly impartial light. It is much more interesting to see how both sides learn and grow from each other by being willing to communicate and learn in what must have been an extremely difficult situation. Helen Mirren gives a miraculous performance and actually appears to be channeling Her Royal Highness. As Philip, James Cromwell portrays one of the few characters in this film who is thoroughly unlikeable. As Charles, Alex Jennings gives the portrayal of a Prince who has spent his life in a state of limbo, and seems to be ineffective both as a Royal Leader as well as a leader in his own home.

The real thing to pay attention to is the acting in this movie. Helen Mirren did an incredible job with this performance.

1562414,4,B00005JPAM,"It's easy to see from Helen Mirren's performance why the Best Actress Oscar category was really no contest this year.  Still, the subject matter still has some feel of tabloid sensationalism, with its dramatization of political scrambling in the aftermath of the shocking death of Diana, Princess of Wales.

No one the movie seems to care about the tragedy itself - only how to secure their personal positions in the eyes of the public. There was no real grief for Diana, and that is indescribably sad.

The best thing about ""The Queen"" goes back to what Ms. Mirren said in her Oscar acceptance speech: that Elizabeth Windsor has weathered so many storms in her 50-plus years on the throne. The movie certainly does justice to Her Majesty's indomitable strength, and the legacy that she is leaving for history.",1176336000,6,810,4.855072463768116
1562415,1,B00005JPAM,"I don't even know where to begin with my review of The Queen other than to say that it's so boring that you should ideally have another DVD going at the same time on a second screen, playing something like ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" unless you want to catch up on some sleep.

Obviously when I saw ""The Queen"" in the theater I didn't have the capability of watching another movie at the same time, but that didn't stop me from spending my time wishing I did.  Here are my thoughts while watching ""The Queen"":

-This is great.  I'm going to learn a lot about The Queen of Europe watching this movie.

-What's she doing?  Walking from one room into another?  Well, I guess Queens do have to do that.

-I can't believe that The King of Queens has been on TV for so many years.  But Kevin James is very, very funny.

-You know what was a good movie?  Hitch.  I think Will Smith and Kevin James should do another movie where they have to travel across the country in a car and maybe one of them is a cop and the other is a bad guy.  That would be hilarious.

-Oh, the Queen is taking her dogs out.  Right.  I'm so sure she doesn't have people that do that for her.

-Hey, how come there's nothing about the King?  No offense to women, but isn't the King more powerful than the Queen?  I mean, I have played Rummy before.

-Juice Newton should have done the soundtrack to this movie.

-Oh my God the Queen still isn't doing anything in this movie except talking and thinking.  No wonder people didn't vote for her for a second term!

-I liked that woman who played The Queen in ""Naked Gun.""  She was hilarious and it taught me that Queens have a human side, which this movie is not doing.

-Tony Blair is a good actor.

-I think the King is being played by the guy from ""Babe""!  He should say, ""that'll do, Queen.  That'll do.""  That would be awesome.  Wait a minute, did he just say something cool?  Oh, no.  My mistake.

-I've got to see ""The Great Muppet Caper"" again.  I spend too much time focusing on the first movie and when they took over Manhattan.  I wish I was alive when muppets took over Manhattan, because that must have dominated the news.

-I've got to go get a snack.

-Alright.  Twizzlers and cherry coke.  Sweet!  If I bite off the end of this Twizzler, I can totally have an edible straw.  What did I miss?  The Queen is making a speech?  Terrific.  That's new and exciting.  I'll have to remember to go back and watch that part when I rent the DVD in the month of Nevertember.

-Thank God for the closing credits.  I wonder where I parked.  Maybe the Queen can help jumpstart my car.  Not.

So basically, there are lots of plot holes and nothing interesting that happened in this movie, except things that were Twizzler-related.",1176076800,11,2738,4.282907662082515
1562416,5,B00005JPAM,This movie gives great insight into the lives of the British Royal Family and the strict rules and laws they choose to live by.

It's not because it's slow: I will most likely take a slow, foreign film over an American action film anyday. I love them, and they usually affect me in ways that fast-paced movies often cannot. This film is just...empty.

I went to see this with my whole family (who are mostly British) and we all hated it. So this isn't a case of ""we don't understand the complexities of the royal family"" or whatnot. Frankly, there is a lot more they could have done with the royal family, instead of just focusing on this one, boring thing. I just feel like this movie is pretentious, trying to be deep (the scene with the stag...so contrived). I feel like a lot of people I know that say they like this movie are trying to seem sophisticated (not all people, I'm only pointing out those who don't usually like these types of movies and suddenly say this is the best thing ever).

1562418,5,B00005JPAM,"The Queen traced the week immediately after the death of Princess Diana in 1997. The movie traced the motivations and actions of Queen Elizabeth as she totally misread the mood of her country regarding Diana's death and her gradual horror at her mistakes. She is aided by her Prime Minister Tony Blair who almost against himself, aided, advised and nurtured Queen Elizabeth back to reality. It pretty clear by this movie that without Blair, Elizabeth would have suffered major damages to her reputation and name. She owed him a great deal for his services toward her. (Maybe a future knighthood or peerage might even the honor.)

Helen Mirren proves to be totally superb in her role. Was there any doubt of her Oscar? She was probably the only sure bet to win. Her performance nailed Elizabeth II right on the money and managed to conveyed the queen's actions and moods following Diana's death. In some way, the real queen owed her a great debt for portarying such a sensitive role. Mirren was well supported by her supporting cast, great script and sublime directing. Michale Sheen was also great as Tony Blair and James Cromwell probably captured Prince Philip's caddish and tunnel vision behavioral pattern down pretty good.

Overall, one of the better movies to come out in 2006, Helen Mirren's performance would be hard to beat in any year.",1175212800,12,1345,4.868995633187773

1562420,4,B00005JPAM,"The message of this movie is to be found in its quiet moments. It is in the silent angst of a woman torn between her personal convictions and public obligations. It is in the graceful and dignified demeanor of a queen, despite the battles that rage within her. You would not know it to look at her, and that's precisely how she would have wanted it, lest you should think her to be some heartless monarch.

The Queen's(Mirren) initial decision to refrain from making any public statement after Princess Diana's death was as much rooted in protocol as it was in a personal grudge. Why should the monarchy make an official statement on behalf of a lady who was no longer the Princess of Wales? Moreover, why should she have to acknowledge a woman who made a mockery of her family? Lost in her own world of justifications, she waits for the hysteria to die down and the public to ""come around""; but they never do. The newly elected Tony Blair(Sheen) serves as a barometer for public opinion to the monarch and coaxes her ever so gently to address Diana's death in a statement, especially with the media quick to disapprove of her stoic disposition. However, Blair, a keen observer, is also mindful of her internal conflict and respects her all the more when she finally makes a decision to appease the English people despite her own misgivings.

The British Monarchy has always lived in the shadow of Diana's popularity, a friction that was brought to surface with the tragic incident. If this movie is a propaganda, then it is a good and well deserved one; at least Her Majesty has finally found a level playing field with the ""People's Princess"". No, the Queen would not have you believe her to be some heartless monarch, but a wise woman who has endured countless administrations throughout the decades, and in doing so, has realized that the demands of her people are more important than her own, even if her appeasement ultimately came at the eleventh hour. Mirren's acting is controlled and contemplative, as it should be, Micheal Sheen lacks presence and the motley cast that surrounds them are forgettable. Considering that more than three-fourths of screen time is devoted to Mirren, the weak supporting cast is not a mitigating factor to the overall excellence of the film by any means.

P.S. This may not be the true representation of what went on behind Buckingham Palace in 1997, but it paints a highly believable scenario.",1174435200,11,2433,4.747044917257683
1562421,5,B00005JPAM,"Picking Helen Mirren to play the queen was an act of genius but even her spectacular performance could not have saved a lackluster script. I find it quite an achievement that this movie was able to create a (sometimes) sympathetic portrait of a woman who fell out of public favor in many circles after Princess Diana's death.

  All the politics of the situation are played out in detail, giving a look at how the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and Mirren did a certain amount of dancing around the situation and the tensions there. The Queen was criticized for her stiffness and lack of emotion, but somehow this film manages to show the cracks in that rigid facade, doing so with a certain modicum of wit and grace. Also, I found myself surprised that the film actually made me think about the possible  benefits of a certain amount of reserve and decorum, commonly known as the ""stiff upper lip"", although I still feel there was far too much coldness on the Queen's part after the Princess died. It is a small miracle that the film manages to make her the slightest bit sympathetic, especially considering the bias many may feel against her because of her actions after Diana's death.

  However you feel about the terrible events of Princess Diana's tragic accident and the events that followed, this movie is a superb portrayal of a woman who may be far more complex than believed. Watch it the first chance you get!",1174348800,7,1418,4.670682730923695

We get very excited when an Oscar contender is found--they are hard to find nowadays. Now that we are just weeks away from 2007, we finally saw a film that has history, humanity, drama and a charismatic touch. ""The Queen"" is one of the best films we've reviewed this year. It is such an entertaining film and we are so eager to tell you about it.

Story:

""The Queen"" tells the ""behind the scenes"" story of how the British Royal Family and the new Tony Blair's government dealt within the first week of the death of Princess Diana on August 31, 1997. An event that shocked the world in so many levels, but especially for the British Royal Family who struggled to keep things quite. The movie focuses on Queen Elizabeth's (Helen Mirren) poor handle of the aftermath and her differences with her new prime minister (Michael Sheen) who wanted her to stop hiding and to face the nation during those difficult times.

Review:

There have been long speculations and conspiracy theories about Princess Diana's death. After 9 years, from time to time, we see TV shows researching the circumstances of her accident and vague conclusions of who is to blame for such a tragedy. ""The Queen"" is not about conspiracy theories, but rather about an alternative story of how the British Royal Family--especially Queen Elizabeth II--showed the world how unprepared and indifferent they were to the British People and the world to deal with a national tragedy. The movie shows the true extraordinary love the world felt for Princess Diana which is something that made some of the members of the royalty very concern.

The way the story is told (almost day by day after her death) creates a realistic feel to it--almost like we were watching the events in real time similar to the movie ""United 93."" The real footage flashbacks are perfectly in place to help the story develop and create drama. ""The Queen"" also shows the British Royal Family as an orthodox old fashion family who didn't want to change their ways despise the press attacking them for that whole week. Wee see a ""behind the iron curtain"" view of who they really are; just ordinary people after all-- sometimes their behavior creates funny moments throughout the film.

The acting is one of best features of ""The Queen."" Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen did a terrific job impersonating these complex and famous characters--they are very look alike to say the least. There is good chemistry while together on the screen. We see them struggling and fighting their own demons. They wanted to make things right--in their own way--but sometimes they couldn't communicate that to each other. We feel there is an Oscar buzz on any of these characters.

Great accomplishments we see in the technical department. The movie is just too darn pretty to look at. We see beautiful British landscapes, great costume design and excellent photography on screen. The editing is also fluid and meticulous.

The Verdict:

A tragic week in the history of The Royal Family and the world, ""The Queen"" gives us its take on the week after the death of the People's Princess. The story is told almost moment by moment, tear by tear felt by everyone who knew and loved her. This movie might generate some controversy and criticism for its accuracy, but they cannot take away the fact that the film is intelligent, symbolic, adventurous and not afraid to come with its own conclusions.",1173657600,5,3416,4.813993174061434
1562423,5,B00005JPAM,"2006 will always be remembered as Helen Mirren's year. after years of being under the radar in great shows like Prime Suspect and movies like The Madness of King George and Gosford Park, Mirren finally roared onto the spot light not only playing one Queen Elizabeth but TWO Queen Elizabeths. first, she scored by playing the original Queen Elizabth in HBO's Elizabth 1 and then she scored again by playing Queen Elizabth 2 in this film, The Queen. the film follows the week after the terrible death of Princess Diana and the seemingly cold response the royal family gives to the death. through it all, Elizabeth 2 keeps her compsure not to buckle under the command while the Prime Minister grows restless over it all. some people have complained that the Queen is one big bore and i have to dissagree, i felt this movie was incredibally great and fully kept me engrossed in the picture. but the real reason i loved the film was Helen, she absolutly radiats as our conflicted queen, not only from the appearence but from her facial expressions, speech, and at just the right moment a bit of compassion. She definently deserved the Oscar, no doubt about it and hopefully now she will finally be reconized for her outstanding talent. to quote from Helen's Oscar speech ""Ladies and gentlemen, i give you the queen!""",1173657600,6,1311,4.729257641921397
1562481,5,B00005JPAM,"I went to this movie on a date expecting it to put me to sleep.  Boy was I ever wrong!  This movie could have easily won best picture too.  It was so well made and Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth was not overstated.  She definitely deserved the award she won.  The movie focuses on the death of Princess Diana and how the Royal family behaved during the period immediately after.

The movie portrayed Elizabeth as someone who stuck to tradition (heavily influenced by her mother) and had faith that by sticking to tradition, the public at large would come around and see that she was right.  Unfortunately those traditions were for a time past and no longer held in the Tabloid influenced world of today where celebrities are put under the microscope and all their actions are highly scrutinized.

Besides Mirren, there were solid performances all around especially by the actor who played Tony Blair.  The director seemed to show that the two smartest people were Blair's and the Queen's personal assistants.  Each one seemed to give the soundest advice of all and both were highly in tune with the public at large.

Even though I basically knew the story going in, I was mesmerized by the way this film was presented.  It should not be missed.",1173657600,4,1259,4.724770642201835

few actresses could portray the queen with the subtlety and humanity helen mirren brings to the role. equally good is the young british actor who plays tony blair as he seeks to bridge the gap between an isolated queen and her people. overall, a sad, engrossing and occasionally even funny look at this chapter in the history of the british royalty.",1172966400,7,680,4.714285714285714
1562484,4,B00005JPAM,"The British royal family has weathered abdications, wars, and scandal. But one of the nastiest hits to them in the twentieth century came when Princess Di was killed.

And so ""The Queen"" tries to get inside the perfectly-permed head of the British Queen Elizabeth II, nearly ten years ago. Helen Mirren gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the title character, as she attempts to weather public and personal difficulties. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

The movie opens with the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), who comes to visit the queen (Mirren), despite being rather nervous about his new job. The country has been off balance ever since Di died in a car crash a few weeks ago, and her passing leaves the royals with mixed feelings. The queen decrees that since Diana divorced Prince Charles, she was no longer a royal, and her arrangements are to be left to her family.

What she doesn't realize is that the people ADORED Diana, and continue to adore her in the weeks that follow. Then the press joins in, berating the royal family for coldly ignoring the ex-princess, and heralding the Labour Party Blair. Her husband and mother think that she should continue doing nothing -- but the Queen has learned that sometimes the people need to be appeased.

""The Queen"" unfolds slowly like an old book, and Stephen Frears gives it the dignified gloss that usually belongs to older movies. Scenes that could have been maudlin or cliche are underplayed, which makes them more powerful. One example is of the queen peering in as Charles tells his young sons that their mother has died.

Fortunately, as in real life, there's also comedy as well as confusion and tragedy; Peter Morgan injects some humor when a nervy Blair meets the Queen for the first time. Morgan also spins u[ the kind of dialogue we can imagine the droll Elizabeth or prickly Prince Philip saying (""Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew. And they think WE'RE mad!"").

Mirren doesn't normally look much like Elizabeth II. She's younger, taller, and prettier. But with some padding and makeup, she manages to BECOME Elizabeth II. She's dignified, haughty, yet Mirren manages to bring across that she's bewildered and vulnerable as well. In short, she makes her version of Elizabeth II a person.

She's also backed by magnificent performances by Sheen and James Cromwell. Cromwell is excellent as the crotchety, stubborn Prince Philip, who thinks the best way to deal with grief is to go hunting. And Sheen is very good as the Prime Minister who is just starting his work, and who gains a new perspective on the royals.

""The Queen"" is a unique, quietly compelling film, as it explores what might have happened within the royal family -- and the person that Queen Elizabeth might be, underneath the royal mask.",1172966400,6,2832,4.836776859504132
1562485,5,B00005JPAM,"Perspective changes with time. Now I can empathsize the Queen. To issue an immediate statement after Princess Diana's death would be irresponsible, an act more suited for a populist cum politician. To be able to stick to her principles (even as it may be out-dated), reflect upon the escalating crisis and do the only thing (not necessarliy the right thing) left to do for the monarchy makes Queen Elizabeth II a truly outstanding soverign. Such is the wonderful script which makes the movie  thought-provoking, warm and intriguing.

Helen Mirren is brilliant in her portrayal of the Queen. I especially like her subtlety, her ""stubborness"" without offending anyone. Instead, she has my complete sympathy. The movie is shot in such a beautiful countryside and full of metaphor. The Queen love the dogs, the deer and may very well be more at ease displaying her emotions toward the animals than towards people. The dialogues may be far from what actually happened but the Queen's personality is wonderfully portrayed.

This is really a film that has done justice to the royal family and provides a refreshing angle towards the historical event of Princess Diana's death. Don't miss it.",1172707200,5,1184,5.061538461538461
1562486,4,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirren is a revolation in this movie, she channels the Queen, it's uncanny how well she nails her.  As for the movie..I enjoyed it, it had a nice pace and the performances, particularly Cromwell as the neanderthal Phillip and the actor who played Tony Blair, but it is Mirren who elevates this movie, she is reviting.  I appreciated the way the director used real stock footage along with newly shot stage pieces; very well done.  If there is one off note performance it was the simpering, pathetic Charles, I just don't see him as being such a dolt.  The real Charles has bucked his mother in the past, and is passionate to a fault on subjects close to his heart, like the environment and modern architecture, the way he is portrayed here, is a cowering wimp, whining and hand wringing, I just did not see that during the time of Diana's death, I thought Charles showed dignity and respectful deferance to his mother, afterall, she is the Queen, not some simpering fool, who is afraid of his mother.  Anyway, all and all, good film..great lead performance: very well earned Acadamy Award, if for the stag sceen alone.",1172620800,5,1124,4.656565656565657
1562487,5,B00005JPAM,"This is a great peice of movie making.  For one thing, the tensions and dramatic moments in this film all occur  between two people talking quietly to one another in relatively small rooms.  Getting that right not only requires superb actors but also camera work that is, like a good butler, both intimate and discreet.

Obviously this is Helen Mirren's movie and she shines in a way that encapsulates much of what made many of us rabid fans of her performances as Jane Tennison on the Prime Suspect television series.  Michael Sheen has some good moments as Tony Blair, and his (fictional) defense of the Queen is both moving and ironic given the way the real Tony has all but tripped over himself being George W. Bush's footstool.

Director Steven Frears and his DP Affonso Beata, deserve huge credit for the emotional intensity and maturity of this film.  The leads are given plenty of room to do their stuff and they do, but the depth of this movie also relies on the stellar supporting cast.

For my money, some of the best performances in the whole movie come from Roger Allam as Her Majesty (HM)'s private secretary Robin Javrin - the real Javrin apparently was a bit miffed at Allam's girth -it being somewhat more substantial than his own), Alex Jennings who plays  a surprisingly sympathetic Prince Charles, and of course Helen McCrory who makes the most of  a rather melodramatically rendered Cherrie Blair (shown as a rather shrill anti-monarchist, which unsurprisingly, did not go over well at Number 10).

To understand the true perceptiveness of this movie in a British context, one has to understand the role of the monarchy in contemporary British society. Despite her aloofness from the public eye, the real Queen (and even more so, the late Queen Mother) were and are figures of great familiarity to the British public.  HM's very deliberate fashion sense and demeanor, while indicative of her own personality, were also essential in completing the transformation of the British monarchy from a 19th century aristocratic family a generation removed from politically-engaged monarchy, to an institution that wields no formal power but which is nonetheless, one of  the emotional lynch pins of modern, middle-class British sensibility.

In contrast to Diana who became a celebrity in full People magazine mode, the Queen presents herself as a symbol of ordinary British middle-class sobriety and restraint.  Whilst much has rightly been made of the mantra ""duty first, self second"", a second and perhaps more important issue in understanding the tension between Diana and ""The Firm"" is the way in which Diana's ""antics"" were seen as a direct challenge to the public image of the older royals as a well-pedigreed but essentially decent and normal version of the good neighbors down the street.  This transformation lies at the heart of the British monarchy's ability to survive two world wars,  the end of the empire, the plummetting cultural prestige of the rest of the aristos, the rise and fall of the welfare state and finally: the triumph of cultural Thatcherism with its petit bourgeois envy and suspicion of anything collective.

On an emotional level, middle-aged Brits tend to view HM as a woman who you could (with the right dress on) feel comfortable borrowing a cup of sugar from.  This leaving aside the actual wealth of the monarchy as an institution, a fact which continues to astound Americans who have a much more prosaic notion of figures of public interest - although I think one partial analogy who has achieved a similar level of emotional familiarity and trust for folks in the United States is Oprah Winfrey.

In the same way that Oprah transcends her racial identity for her white audiences, the Queen (but interestingly, not her husband, nor to some extent her son Charles) has transcended her class position as the uber-aristocrat in a Britain where class is still vitally important (if somewhat muted by comparison with the 1930s).  At the risk of generalizing, I would say that a majority of Brits still feel a sense of personal loyalty to  the Queen herself (and hence the monarchy), while not necessarily supporting the class system, nor the political goals of the establishment.

To the Queen, Diana then represented the culmination of a ""loss of face"" brought on by the younger royals (and Princess Anne's) public disgraces (primarily divorces) captured on the front pages of the loathsome tabloid press.  Whether or not she was the people's princess, she was certainly seen as garish, attention-seeking and vulgar by the Royal establishment.  Paradoxically perhaps, the very same solid citizens who relished the normality of the Queen, also devoured the fairy-tale glamor provided by Diana.  Royalty both serves and entertains, and in the age of reality TV, Diana was for better or worse, the icon for celebrity-royalty.

HM's inability to engage with the changing face of Britain (generationally, racially and in terms of it's attachments to the outward symbols of class identity),  probably did blind her to the extent to which Diana of all the younger royals actually achieved the level of perceived personal intimacy that the Queen herself enjoyed.  I would hazard a guess that much of the public grief that was displayed at Diana's death was not over the death of Diana herself, but was an expression of mourning for personal tragedies.  Diana was a symbol for people's aspirations, and she was a person who continued to feed a sense of communal identity albeit through the glamor of celebrity despite her divorce.  In that sense, she was indeed ""the people's princess"".

Director Frears deserves huge credit for capturing this tension without ever needing to bring the two women into contact with one another.  Mirren's Elizabeth reacts to televised images of Diana but we see the baffled annoyance she must have provoked in real life.  This is not a documentary, it is a work of fiction that seeks to highlight particular ideas and characters.  We will probably never know what HM thinks of the movie, but thanks to Frears and writer Peter Morgan have given us an intelligent, engaging and thought-provoking window into the human condition and into the possible mindset of a person who could be the longest-reigning constitutional monarch in a democracy since Queen Victoria.",1172534400,7,6331,5.020076481835564
1562488,5,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirren won the Academy Award for her portrayal of HRH Elizabeth II with a performance that knocked me out.  Her small nuances and gestures and even her walk easily evoke Her Majesty - the one in my public mind.  As the film progresses we're privy to behind locked door scenes that are only the speculation of Director Stephen Frears and Alan Morgan - but they fit in perfectly with what we think we know about the house of Mountbatten-Windsor.  In the emotional final act, Dame Mirren's performance becomes even more remarkable as she gives us a brief glimpse into the humanity of the woman never seen by the public eye.

Michael Sheen gives an equally impressive supporting performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair, who as the film opens has just been elected from the Labor Party in a landslide after eighteen years of Conservatives. (Blair's predecessors John Major and Margaret Thatcher aren't mentioned.) The Queen and her advisors are in preparation for Mr. Blair's promise to shake things up when tragedy strikes.

For those too young to remember the effect that the unexpected death of Lady Diana had on the world - ""Princess Di"" married Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales and future King of England, while she was a teenager and Charles was in his thirties.  The Prince has a reputation for being very properly British - stiff upper lip and all that - and somewhat detached from the ""real world"" while Diana hung out with rock stars and made conspicuous public appearances that made her maybe the world's most famous celebrity.  They were married fifteen years, had two sons, and divorced a year before her death in Paris - her car speeding in a narrow tunnel, trying to flee paparazzi.  For the twelve-year old reader: if Anna Nicole had intelligence, charm, character, and had devoted years of her life to world-wide charitable causes like the fight against AIDS and land-mines, after being married to the future King of England, well... you get the idea.

Anyway - back to the film.  Diana and Charles have been divorced for a year, and when she is killed she is no longer ""Her Royal Highness, the Princess of Wales"".  In addition, the media attention around Diana and her split from Charles has not been flattering to the Royals.  When Elizabeth is told that Diana's family, the Spencers, want to have a private funeral, the Queen is satisfied with that.  She doesn't want a big ""to-do"" and, after all, it's what her family wanted.  A recurrent theme in the film is how badly the Queen and her advisors initially underestimate the national and world-wide outpouring of grief over Diana's tragic death.

The royal family is on holiday at the massive estate at Balmoral.  While the Queen is away the flag doesn't fly over Buckingham Palace.  But mourners are lining up outside the Palace and leaving flowers and keep-sakes outside the royal gates and Prime Minister Blair correctly senses that the British people think that the Queen and her family should return to London and fly the flag at half-mast.

Elizabeth worked for the British Military transportation during World War II and when her father died and she became Queen in 1952, her first Prime Minister was Winston Churchill.  Her Majesty is ""old school"", and she knows protocol.  Her subjects are demanding a degree of Royal respect and honor which she knows that she would not receive if she were to die herself.  She wants to shield her grandsons from the brouhaha in London - it's bad enough that they've lost their mother, isn't it?

James Cromwell gives a great performance as the Queen's husband, Prince Phillip, and Sylvia Syms gets many of the best lines as the Queen Mother. Alex Jennings looks a little bit like Prince Charles - from behind - and he gives a good performance that shows that Charles had strong feelings for Diana a year after their divorce.

The best scenes take place between the Prime Minister and Her Majesty - some of them phone conversations.  A subtle, but plainly growing, degree of respect develops between the two of them as they both realize that the other is behaving in a way that is perfectly understandable.  Mr. Blair realizes that the Queen is a product of her upbringing and experience and that she has always behaved in the best interests of her country, while Elizabeth realizes that Mr. Blair is being both respectful of the crown while having his finger on the pulse of her subjects.

Doesn't everyone wonder what the real Queen (and others behind the gates of Buckingham Palace) think of this film?  I think they wouldn't be disappointed.  The Mrs. and I give two thumbs up.",1172361600,6,4600,4.7812895069532235
1562489,4,B00005JPAM,"What's interesting about ""The Queen"" is that it gives insight into the life of a public figure that's actually quite private: Queen Elizabeth II. I obviously have no way of understanding the responsibilities associated with ruling a country, but--at the risk of stating the obvious--I can imagine that it isn't easy. Every decision, action, and idea that's made will meet with praise and/or criticism on a global scale. Options must be weighed for the benefit of her people, not for the benefit of herself or her family. She must be willing to be scrutinized and ridiculed by the media, who legally have the right to attack her character, disagree with her policies, and mock her in general. These issues are skillfully examined in this film. However, I'm hard pressed to say that it's an accurate examination. Likewise, some viewers may be turned off by its consistently dry tone.

Nonetheless, there's a lot about this film to enjoy, not the least of which is Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen; here's a woman that was raised to believe that the needs of her country outweigh her own needs. While she's diligent and professional when it comes to governmental affairs, her emotions are kept under lock and key. This proved to be troublesome in August of 1997, when Diana, Princess of Wales, died in Paris in an automobile accident. The Queen's immediate reaction is deciding to keep the Royal Family out of the public eye. Part of this decision had to do with Diana's children, who needed to grieve without the press hassling them. The rest had to do with the Queen's disapproval of Diana; she saw her as nothing more than a publicity hound. Furthermore, Diana was technically no longer a member of the Royal Family (she divorced Prince Charles a year earlier). Because of that, it seemed proper to respect the wishes of the Spencer family to have a private funeral.

This does not sit well with the British population, who generally loved Diana for her humanitarianism. Public opinion soon turns against the Queen. At the same time, the popularity ratings for the newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), are rising; he's been much more public about Diana's tragic death. A majority of the film focuses on his working relationship with the Queen, specifically in trying to get her to cooperate and listen to her people. They want her to make a statement. They want her to raise the flag over Buckingham Palace at half-mast. They want her to acknowledge the throngs of Diana supporters that are leaving bouquets at the Palace gates. She refuses to take part in the media frenzy. In her mind, Diana's death is a private matter; the public will simply have to accept that.

It's soon decided that Diana's funeral will, in fact, be a public affair. True, the Queen finds this highly improper. However, she also begins to understand the British people will not let this one go; they want Diana to have a proper funeral, and the want their Queen to show some degree of compassion. The pressure they put on her is increasing, so much so that long buried emotions begin to resurface. Example: while walking through a remote countryside, she cries for the first time. It's obvious that years of royal etiquette have had an impact; despite the fact that she's alone and surrounded by acres of open land, her sobs are forcefully restrained. In that moment, her only comfort is a wild buck that passes by; it's large, majestic, and clearly symbolic of strength and fortitude.

At that point, she finally begins taking Blair's advice, much to the chagrin of her husband, Philip (James Cromwell), and her mother (Sylvia Sims). She publicly walks past the piles of bouquets, reading notes written by Diana supporters (one says, ""Your blood is on their hands""). She makes a televised statement (albeit a prewritten, mechanical, emotionless one). It all leads up to Diana's funeral, a full media blowout with celebrity attendance, including Luciano Pavarotti, Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Elton John (who would score a hit with the new version of ""Candle in the Wind""). By the time the funeral ends, the Queen's relationship with Prime Minister Blair has diminished considerably. Their final scene acts as a counterpart to their first, in which they meet: the latter is a light, pleasant moment between the two; the former is tense and reserved.

Some might think that the purpose of ""The Queen"" is to portray Elizabeth II as a cold, uncaring, conservative individual. Indeed, her engrained devotion to duty and honor doesn't make her especially gregarious. However, I don't think the filmmakers were attempting to portray her in any particular fashion, nor do I think they were passing judgment on her; instead, they were presenting her plainly and directly, allowing the audience to come to their own conclusions. Maybe it's best that we do no such thing; very few can appreciate the responsibilities and sacrifices required of a ruler.",1172275200,3,4948,4.9209580838323355
1562490,4,B00005JPAM,"Was skeptical of going to this movie, another account of the royals and all. Was absolutely convinced I was watching the Queen herself in Mirren's portrayal. Incorrectly titled as just 'The Queen', when in actuality this film is dealing with the Queen's and the Country's response to the death of Princess Diana. This is one moment in time. As far as the Queen's entire life, was expecting more history. Blair saves the day, and the staunchy people are flustered. Leaves you feeling a bit for the Queen, they missed the mark on Charles. Overall interesting.",1172188800,4,557,4.873684210526315
1562531,4,B00005JPAM,"Biopics are a dime a dozen, and the ability to make a successful biopic depends largely on who you're making the biopic of, who it's fanbase of the loved public figure is, and whether or not you want to please that fanbase or tick them off. ""The Queen"" chooses the middle road in this final decision, which was a risky move on the film makers part, but one that pays off nicely. ""The Queen"" is a fictional story of the events that take place after Princess Diana's untimely death. After a series of news clips that show Diana behaving questionably, we then cut to a servant waking up Prince Philip and letting him know that Diana has been killed in a car crash. The newly appointed prime minister Tony Blair is quick to make a statement about Diana's death, uttering his famous quote ""she was the people's princess.""

After his statement, Blair goes to the royals and asks if they would like to say anything publicly about Diana's death. Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren, in a role that is sure to win her a Best Actress award come Oscar time) refuses, stating ""no member of the royale family will comment on the Princesses death."" The royals no longer consider Diana part of the royal family, remembering her as a woman who partied too much, had public affairs, and was an overall headache. Besides, the death of a family member is a ""personal family affair, and the public will understand that."" Too bad for the Queen, but the public doesn't respond well to the silence at all. They eagerly await a public acknowledgment from their queen, and are furious at the silence of the royals. When the royals refuse to hang their flag down to acknowledge the loss of a loved one, tempers flair even more.

The media prints news article after news article, condemning the royals for their silence, while the Prince just mumbles about how rude the people are being. ""They talk as if they were the one's who knew her,"" he says angrily. ""To them she was a saint, to us she was a nuisance."" Blair has a public relations nightmare as he tries to calm Britains anger, but finds himself in popular light where everyone is in favor of destroying the monarchy in favor of a new government (preferably with Blair in it). The royals themselves don't come off as cruel, selfish people, but rather as people who are controlled by tradition and time. The world has evolved greatly since Queen Elizabeth II began her ruling, where she once was the Queen, but now is the Queen in name only. She does not interact with people outside of the castle and royal grounds, and simply cannot relate to the peoples outrage.

As the week goes on, we feel sad for her when she loses sleep at night, feeling hurt and rejected by her people. She can't even begin to figure out why they hate her so much. Is it too much to ask for some privacy when mourning the loss of a family member? Was Diana still considered a family member when the royal family rejected her a few years ago? If she is not, then why is it her responsibility to make a statement? When she discovers that Diana's funeral will be attended by celebrities, she wonders whether or not people will be watching Diana's funeral as if it were the circus. Compared to Prince Philips, who openly shows a lot of resentment towards Diana, Queen Elizabeth II truly comes off as someone who cares about the situation, but just doesn't know what to do about it. Even Prince Charles urges her to make a statement, though he certainly doesn't completely understand what his mother is going thru.

When Queen Elizabeth II finally does exit the castle to be with her people while they mourn, she is shocked and touched by how much love and emotion she feels from her people. Her eyes swell up with tears, as if she was feeling what it was like to be a true queen again for the first time in years. There was a whole world she was missing full of love and compassion, and it was waiting for her if she would just go outside once in awhile. Even Tony Blair, who receives the full blow of the ripple effect caused by the royals silence, begins to understand where the Queen is coming from. When his wife encourages Blair to just let the Queen ""hang herself,"" Blair frowns at her and says ""You don't understand, this is six hundred years of tradition she's throwing away.""

Yes the royals made a mistake, but maybe it wasn't a mistake. Maybe it was a miscalculation. The royals certainly couldn't have predicted what silence would mean to Britain, and they were unprepared for the backlash they received. Maybe they just didn't understand the situation in the first place? Maybe we didn't take the time to understand their feelings, or wonder what their situation was? Maybe it was a combination of all the above? Regardless what the situation was, it was all worth it for a little bit more understanding of each other. For in the midst of confusion, hope shined through.

1562532,5,B00005JPAM,"In the first week of September 1997, between the death of Princess Diana and her funeral, Queen Elizabeth (Mirren) was in a situation that she had no preparation for.  She did not feel anything should be done for the princess by the monarchy, as she has divorced from Prince Charles (Jennings), but the people of England were looking to her to show some compassion.  Newly elected Prim Minister Tony Blair (Sheen) attempts to offer advice to the Queen, but he mostly rebuffed.  Adding to the tension is the fact that Blair's popularity skyrockets in this time of national mourning.

""The Queen"" is a fascinating look into the world of the British Monarchy.  I know very little about it, and the film held my interest throughout.  Mirren is excellent as a queen who is struggling to maintain the only lifestyle she has ever known in the face of changing times and a popular ex-monarch's death.  Sheen is also good as Tony Blair.  All in all, ""The Queen"" is an extremely engaging film that is worth seeing.",1171843200,2,1004,4.6971428571428575
1562533,5,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirren is AMAZING in this film.  You just can't mention this brilliant movie with giving kudos to an actress who steps into the shoes of England's current monarch and makes you believe with such eery success that she IS the Queen.

This movie, one of the best of the year, looks at the life of Queen Elizabeth II, during the week of Diana's death.  With Tony Blair as a beginning Prime Minister (and played to perfection by actor Michael Sheen), the Queen tries to deal with the Diana's tragic death and the public's perception of how she should grieve.  Trying to protect Diana's young sons and preferring to hide at Balmoral, the Queen brings about the wrath of her citizens, seemingly acting in a cold and uncaring way to the death of a woman loved world wide.

The movie is short and conise: the director concentrating on a dramatic time in the Queen's life, a turning point that perhaps changed the idea of the monarchy for the Queen and her public.  Mirren seems to fall away, becoming a woman who can't understand how she should be forced to deal with such a private matter in public, but eventually surrendering to the will of her people.  I found one scene very interesting, in which she grieves the lost of a brilliant stag, shot on a neighboring territory.  She waves him away, hoping to save him from hunters.  To me, the stag in a sense, was like Diana, beautiful but hunted incessantly.  However, with the stag, it seemed the Queen could grieve much easier and yet found it difficult to deal with the death of her grandchildren's mother.

The cast does an incredible job with their roles (James Cromwell is [...]and mean spirited as Prince Philip) and as I mentioned before, Michael Sheen becomes Tony Blair.  The one actor I didn't care for was Alex Jennings who played Prince Charles.  He never seemed to get the mannerisms and character of the Prince of Wales, though the film treats him with sympathy as opposed to the other royals.  Other than that, this movie is deserving of winning the big award, Best Picture of the Year.

If you enjoy great acting, the royal family or the brilliant Helen Mirren, you must go and see this film.  I look forward to the dvd release of this film!",1171756800,7,2206,4.575063613231552
1562534,4,B00005JPAM,"This is certainly a magnificent performance from Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II. In fact the entire cast, particularly Michael Sheen as Prime Minister, Tony Blair and James Cromwell as Prince Phillip, all did fine performances. Great credit must go to the director, Stephan Frears, as has been mentioned, each well performed scene follow seamlessly and the story itself, screen writer, Peter Morgan managed to capture the feelings of the world at the death of Princess Diana and the apparent lack of compassion from the house of Windsor, specifically Queen Elizabeth.

The film also approaches the debated issue whether the Monarchy is an out-dated institution, a thousand year line of monarchs that have ruled Britain and made this little island in the Atlantic, an empire not seen since the height of the Roman Empire. However times change, and since the French Revolution, the concept of Monarchy has been shown to be, at the least, superfluous, not paying tax and living off the people. The Nobility not paying tax was in fact one of the contributing factors in the creation of the French Revolution. If you talk to a social conscious Brit, they are either opposed to the institution and would like to see England become a republic or are true monarchists, conservative and wanting to see the customs and age old traditions continue because they contain values that are relevant even in our so-called modern times. This issue is tastefully explored and leans towards the institution remaining and adapting in our new millennium.

We currently live in a world where our deepest fears and private concerns are broadcasted for all to hear and see. It is now fashionable to `wear our hearts on our sleeves' go on a popular talk shows and spill our guts out. This has not always been the case. In an older generation, a truly English attribute, was to not show emotion, keep a stiff upper lip, and carry through any crises with dignity. Queen Elizabeth the II worked as a mechanic during WW II, and was crowned Queen at a young age, and the first prime minister she had to deal with was Winston Churchill. To show `unnecessary' emotion during a time of loss was simply not done, and doing so, showed weakness. This new fashion to display emotion to the masses was beyond the queen's understanding and anathema to everything she represented. The notions of modernism and tradition and our changing sensibilities are the crux of the film.

The film's ending gives the audience a clue as to the direction England is heading in terms of tradition and our modern world.

Helen Mirren is absolutely Queen Elizabeth the II...almost scary in her portrayal of the monarch...suspending all disbelief, she had me believing she actually was the monarch...Oscar material in the realist sense.

I for one never believed that the monarchy was seriously under threat.  It was her subject's dismay and disapproval of the queen's ice-cool manner that is supposed to express dignity and fortitude in the face of extremis that had to change.  In our present touchy-feely age  where anything goes and public displays of emotion encouraged, this kind of stoicism is becoming increasingly misunderstood by later generations of H.M.'s subjects.  All this excessive formality had to go - or at least bring us some blessed relief from it all!  However, lessons have been learned, scars are healing and the queen has recovered her undoubted popularity here in Great Britain.

Of course, Elizabeth was raised in a different time and age. Ensconced in various palaces, she rarely gets the opportunity to see what the realm she ironically leads, is like. When her ex-daughter-in-law, the popular Diana, tragically dies in an auto accident, Elizabeth has no conception of what a storm it will set off, both in Britain and the world. She has no *ability* to conceive of it, either: she believes that death is a private affair, and that England is a country of people who are as private and guarded as is she. On top of that, she personally bears Diana no particular goodwill, and so Elizabeth decides to treat Diana's death as a non-event.

But the British people--a different British people than Elizabeth imagines--demands a response. Demands a human, feeling monarchy. Blair, the new man of the people, represents this to the Queen, and so we are introduced to a struggle of wills between the old, controlled, powerful Queen, and the new face of Blair. It is also a struggle, more generally, between tradition and change. If you know what normally wins that struggle, or you remember these particular events in your own lifetime, then you know which side wins.

Elizabeth is presented an impossible choice: change and relent, or the monarchy, itself, will crack. It is a wonderfully dramatic scenario, and thrilling to watch it portrayed by such a talented, capable actress. Mirren will win the Best Actress Oscar, and she will deserve it.

It is also fun to watch other famous characters, such as Blair and Prince Charles, portrayed. It's hard to not like Blair in this film (as he eventually comes around to respect the monarchy he once found silly and dated), and hard not to feel sorry for him in his own, more recent, fall from popular approval. Prince Charles is another matter all-together: it is moving to watch him grieve for Diana, and painful to watch how this man (the would-be King of England) is so bowed over and controlled by others in his life. Despite the fact that the Queen is the centerpiece, the others are all interesting character studies in their own right.

It is rare to have a historical film about events so recent, revolving around people still living and capable (and, in fact, still in power). It's nice to be given this sort of insight into the people we still see on the news, to be able to reconsider our once-held notions of them, instead of waiting until they're long-dead to reflect. The Queen provides us with this rare opportunity, and it does so in an entertaining and brilliantly acted way.

This is a wonderful movie.

This is the shorters review (book or DVD) that I've written.  I took my mom out to see this movie cause I knew she would like it (and I haven't been to a cinema in eons).  The overdriving theme in this close-to-real-life drama, is that the anachronistic lifestyle of the monarchy, and the fight between modernist parlamentarian mindset vs. monarchial autocracy.  The purely proper British language, manners, and formalism were amusing rather.  Also, the story is centered around the time when princess Diana had her fatal accident and how the monarchy responded.  Enjoy this short drama (93 minutes).

Now I can say, I understand why the Brits say ""God save the Queen!"" ;-)",1170979200,2,691,4.905172413793103
1562539,4,B00005JPAM,"I enjoyed this movie greatly. It was superbly done. Mirren makes you believe in her as the Queen. The Blair-a-like and the Charles-a-like are a bit less convincing. Prince Philip is one of the special treats, so absurdly lost in convention and cliche and so far from anything close to reality.

I do not have much for or against the 'royals' but this revelation of their obtuseness is made credible by Mirren's restrained performance. The filmgoer is actually moved to a certain sympathy for the Queen. The most touching moment is when she comes at last to Buckingham and sees the tons of flowers outside which are expressions of love for the deceased Diana. She takes a bouquet from a little girl and asks her 'May I place it for you?' When the little girl says 'It's for you, Ma'am' one sees the Queen suddenly moved, vulnerable and human.

There is however one part of the film which did really put me off. It has to do with the hunting business, and involves the killing of a huge elk and the Queen's incidentally being forced to see it hanging after its shot. Yicchh. Totally disgusting.

In fact this also points to the objectionable almost inhumane ethic which at times seems to rule among the Royals and the English Aristocracy.

In any case this movie is filled with small gems of ridiculousness and absurdity which bring forth pleasant laughter.

Apparently we human beings of the lower orders take great enjoyment in laughing at our so- called 'betters'.",1170979200,,1465,4.70703125

The movie itself is pretty boring. Best director? There really wasn't that much going on. Doesn't mean that the movie is based on true events means it HAS to be a good movie automatically. C'mon. Thank god this movie was short movie, cause if it had ran over 120min i'd probab walk out or fall asleep.

Helen Mirran does gives a very detailed  and insightful performance (she is touted to win the oscar) and James Cromwell is uncanny look alike for Prince Phillip.

This movie really focuses on the week following Diana's death, from the perspectives of two families:  the Royal Family, and newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair's family.  The movie is not complementary regarding the Royals (particularly Prince Philip), and is very complementary of Blair.

After watching The Queen, you will find yourself wondering how much is true, and how much is fiction?

For this, wait for Tony Blair's autobiography.  Don't wait up for the Royal family's book... that would be too undignified.",1170460800,2,705,5.12280701754386
1562593,5,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirren's performance as Queen Elizabeth II is as finely nuanced a performance as you are likely to see in a motion picture.  ""The Queen"" who suffers the woeful ignorance regarding protocol of her new prime minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen,) at Buckingham Palace is not the same woman we see with her family is their retreat at Balmoral any more than that is the same woman who jumps into her old jeep and takes off on her own at the family's Scottish estate.  But the point is that they are the same woman and while the differences between those facets might be ones of minute degree, Mirren has captured them exquisitely, which is why she is now the greatest favorite to win the Oscar in the history of handicapping the Academy Awards.

Written by Peter Morgan (whose ""The Last King of Scotland"" is probably going to win the Oscar for Best Actor) and directed by Stephen Frears (""Dangerous Liaisons""), this 2006 nominee for Best Picture is primarily about the week following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997.  For the Queen the death of Diana is a private matter and the fact that Diana was no longer an HRH dictates the crown say nothing even more than a desire not to feed the media frenzy that played a role in her death.  But for Blair (with the help of his speech writer), Diana is the ""People's Princess,"" and he can see the threat to the monarchy by the Queen's silence in the face of this national tragedy even if her majesty cannot.  It is the middle class Blair, the first Labour PM in a generation, who has to persuade Elizabeth that her traditional quiet dignity, which has served her so well for a half century as Queen of England, is woefully inadequate to the moment at hand.

The flaws of the film are not questions of movie making but exist because of fidelity to the events of that week.  In the immediate wake of Diana's death the paparazzi who relentlessly pursued her are vilified, but when the tabloid rags that paid for all those photographs of the princess turn the growing wrath of the public away from themselves and onto the royal family nobody calls them on their self-serving interests.  If Elizabeth, Charles and the rest of the family thought it was wrong to take the young princes away from Balmoral and back to the circus in London it is hard to fault them for their logic (if they had been at Buckingham palace they might have fled to Balmoral anyhow).  The whole point about lowering a flag that is only flown when the monarch is in residence, a tradition followed for four hundred years, still bothers me.  The flag was not lowered to half-mast for Queen Victoria or Winston Churchill, so the idea that it should be lowered for anybody still strikes me as being wrong.  Still, ""The Queen"" makes it clear that if there had been more from the monarch early on, there would have been less required as a public ""mea culpa"" later.

For me the villain of the piece is Blair's wife, Cherie (Helen McCrory), who grins idiotically when performing a ""shallow"" curtsey in the presence of the Queen and takes glee in what is happening to the monarchy.  It takes most of the film, but eventually it is Blair himself who has to articulate why the woman sitting on the throne deserves respect if not loyalty.  I doubt that most Americans even know of the young Elizabeth Windsor who was an auto mechanic during World War II, when she and her mother and sister stayed in London during the Blitz, while thousands of other young children were being sent out of town (as see in the opening of ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"").  Those of us who know of how Fate intervened to put this woman on the throne can only look at Cherie Blair and observe that Elizabeth did more for her country as a teenager than the prime minister's wife has done in her entire life.

It is interesting to see how the funeral itself is reduced to almost an epilogue, although there is still a key scene to come afterwards.  Although it seem to be on point the moment where Elizabeth and the royal family stood at the gate of Buckingham palace and bowed their heads is omitted, as are such memorable moments as Elton John singing a new version of ""Candle in the Wind"" or the card to ""Mummy"" that Harry put on his mother's coffin.  For this film all that matters is that the Queen sits in Westminster and listens to Diana's brother laud his dead sister, extolling her as true royalty, because even once she gets her wake up call, the Queen has to have her nosed rubbed in it one more time.  Mirren's Elizabeth might be wrong in her reaction to the death of Diana, but once again the fault lies with Fate and not with the heart of a queen who has served her subjects the way she was taught long ago and once upon a time when she had been the princess of her people.

Mirren must be looking forward to Oscar night when she will only have to give one acceptance speech rather than two, since at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards she won not only the top actress award for a movie for ""The Queen"" but also for her performance in ""Elizabeth I"" on television.  I have no doubt that each performance enhances the other in the minds of voters since the two Elizabeths certainly evince the range of Mirren's acting abilities (and both have her delivering speeches actually given by each monarch, which appeals to me as a rhetorician).  Mirren's acceptance speeches to date have been exemplary in being short and to the point, suggesting that some of the gravitas of her character may well have rubbed off on her.",1170374400,3,5549,4.488579940417081

""The Queen"" provides us with a fascinating glimpse into the heart of a royal - or, in the case of Queen Elizabeth II, quite possibly the void where that heart ought to be.

The movie takes place in the weeks following the death of the beloved Princess Diana on August 30, 1997 (Diana had just recently gotten divorced from Prince Charles, so technically, she was no longer a part of the royal family). It was during this period of intense national mourning that the Queen demonstrated that she had a tin ear when it came to gauging the mood and feelings of her subjects. For many days, as the grieving multitudes gathered outside the gates of Buckingham Palace, weeping uncontrollably and laying down a veritable sea of flowers in the Princess' memory, the Royals remained holed up on a country estate, voluntary captives to ""protocol,"" making not so much as a single public statement acknowledging Diana's death or providing any words of solace to a hurting nation.

The coldness of the reaction prompted many in England to seriously consider abolishing the monarchy altogether, once and for all consigning it to the ash heap of history as a quaint relic of a bygone era, an anachronistic institution that had long since outlived its usefulness. Yet, the film is much more sympathetic in its treatment of the monarch than that barebones synopsis would suggest, for more than anything else, it sees the queen less as a heartless monster than as an old-fashioned woman ill-equipped to deal with a modern world where baring one's soul in public has become the unquestioned norm and even a dignified solemn funeral is turned into a celebrity-laden, made-for-TV spectacle. She seems genuinely baffled and stunned by the unprecedented outpouring of grief over Diana's death, partly because of the queen's own animosity towards the woman whom she felt demeaned the court by many of her actions, and partly because the queen herself hails from a time when one did one's grieving in private, and when the sole role of a leader in a time of national crisis was to project an image of ""stiff-upper-lipped"" stoicism and strength for her people.

It would have been easy for writer Peter Morgan and director Stephen Frears to have concentrated exclusively on the queen's aloofness and coldness, to have turned her into a caricature of the snooty, self-absorbed, ""let them eat cake"" aristocrat. Instead, the filmmakers insist on seeing her as a fully rounded human being, strong willed and unemotional, yet capable of being wounded by the disapproval of her subjects and of extending a hand of compassion to others in her own uniquely subtle way.

Small wonder that Helen Mirren has been showered with every conceivable acting honor for her incomparable portrayal of this complex woman. Mirren has been handed the challenge of illuminating a character who is, by her very nature, unimpassioned and undemonstrative. As such, the actress has had to rely almost exclusively on the subtlest of expressions and gestures to convey the brittleness, stoicism and genuine royal dignity of a woman who literally grew up in the role of one of the world's longest-serving monarchs (she notes early on in the film that the first person to serve as her Prime Minister was a certain someone named Winston Churchill). Yet, Mirren's ability to also show us the queen's compassionate and vulnerable side is what brings the character to life and engages our interest.

Mirren is matched by the brilliant Michael Sheen, whose performance as the newly elected Tony Blair is every bit as mesmerizing as hers. Blair comes off so favorably in this film that one is tempted to suspect some sort of collusion on the part of the scriptwriter and the Prime Minister himself. As envisioned by Morgan, Blair is the perfect foil for the queen, a ""modern"" man who is able to ever-so-gently prod her highness into saving her royal arse by doing the right thing politically. For Blair is, if nothing else, a clear-eyed pragmatist who, when all around him are calling for imperial heads to roll, shrewdly knows that a palace coup would not be in the best interests of England at this time.

There are fine performances too by James Cromwell as Prince Phillip, Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mum, Alex Jennings as a very milquetoasty Prince Charles, and Helen McCrory as Blair's straightforward, no-nonsense wife who can't understand how her Labor Party husband could be so willing to help the queen extricate herself from the rather sticky wicket she's gotten herself into. The film supplies a generous helping of actual newsreel footage from the time to effectively flesh out the context of the drama.

Almost in spite of itself, the film winds up moving us, even though, in terms of style, ""The Queen"" is every bit as dry, brittle - some might even say ""stuffy"" - as the woman who is its subject. Which is precisely why - for all us Anglophiles out here in particular - it makes for such a jolly good show at the cinema.",1169856000,,4977,4.867768595041323
1562597,4,B00005JPAM,"I really liked this movie and Helen Mirren -- as usual -- does a fantastic job of portraying the Queen and her royally dysfunctional family as complex anachronisms.  Ms Mirren absolutely deserves the kudo's she has received and could easily capture an oscar for her performance.  She is definitely aided by the makeup and costumes which also deserve mention as being outstanding.  Several things stand out in this movie which I felt served to capture the royal family, its isolation, its dislike of Diana (and why), and its weird family dynamics.  The line ""Diana is even more annoying dead than she was alive"" I thought captured their real dislike of her as a person.  Even more distrubing was the reaction the Queen had to the death of the stag versus her reaction to the death of Diana. Heart felt emotion for the stag, nothing for Diana.  The flap over the flag was a real indication of how this family is trapped by tradition and protocol, which is more important to them than people.  In fact this film, which may be close to the truth, shows that the royal family lives in a gilded cage constructed of tradition, protocol, slavish minions, and isolation from any real people. No one dares tell them the truth or to disturb the tranquility of their placid and unreal existence.  Clearly this is why Diana was so despised by them.  Diana was outgoing, hated the protocol, the stiffness and almost total lack of emotion, love, or family.  She was everything they hated but everything they needed.  Of course they really never understood that and even today they have little grasp of how outdated they are as an institution.  This is a totally dysfunctional family and you see Prince Charles as a grown man incapable of making his own decisions because he must get permission from the Queen.  Prince Phillip -- one minute he is husband and the next he is subject, but clearly he is the most isolated of all -- and likes it that way -- unless he doesn't get his way.  These are living anachronisms and Mirren manages to convey that even they are beginning to realize that.

The Tony Blair character (Sheen) is well done and really shows the schizophrenic attitude the Brits have toward the Royal Family.  The PM of England is certainly one of the most powerful men in the world, yet we see him bowing and (gag) kneeling to kiss the hand of the sovereign.  It shows how he has the power but his power is fleeting while the royal family has the influence which remains as long as the monarchy exists.  Which the film clearly shows is on shaky ground due to the isolation of the royal family.

I only gave this 4 stars because I thought the cinematography was distracting at times and there were too many gratuitous shots of Diana, but Mirren's performance is well worth the price of admission.",1169856000,,2793,4.628803245436106
1562598,5,B00005JPAM,"Oh,  I loved this movie!  It was so interesting,  with such wonderful acting.  I felt like I was sitting in the room with some of the characters,  spying on them as they went about their business.  The amazing Helen Mirren,  while a tad too tall and slim to be 100% convincing,  nevertheless pulled it off so well that you sometimes think it's Her Majesty playing herself.  Likewise the Tony and Cherie Blair characters.  It was an interesting experience watching the actor who played Charles,  because I felt he looked nothing like Charles,  lacking the prominent ears and nose,  but he looked eerily like the photos one sees of his great uncle the Duke of Windsor,  so it gave a strange feeling of ""wrong character,  right family.""  A little prosthesis to the nose and ears of this actor would have placed him in the ""right on the money"" category as well.

  I haven't read any of the reviews yet,  but I have a feeling that at least some of them will involve intensive discussion of the obvious emotional retardation of the British Royal family.  The hordes of slavish Diana worshippers will no doubt be out in droves to see how their icon is portrayed.  I was pleased to see that this movie was a well-balanced and fair representation of the interests of all parties concerned.  It showed all facets of the participants: the antiquated,  repressive atmosphere of an ancient lineage that has no clue as to how outmoded it is,  how out of touch with modern life it is,  and how much damage they've done to the lives of all who come in contact with them,  is neatly juxtaposed with its portrayal of a woman who knows no other way but how she has been raised,  and is a basically decent person who has devoted her life to the people she feels she was born to reign over.  It also portrays Diana fairly,  the young and lovely woman thrown into a situation she was not ready for,  the gracious princess who served the world with compassion and humour,  the wonderful mother who gave her sons a decent foundation was fairly balanced with Diana as a neurotic,  needy,  somewhat histrionic jetsetter who used the press for her own gains and then ended up dying almost at their hands.  The movie shows the people involved as they really are,  the best and the worst of them,  real,  three-dimensional,  multi-faceted human beings.

1562599,4,B00005JPAM,"This film details Queen Elizabeth's (Helen Mirren) reaction to Princess Diana's death and her relationship with new Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen).  As Elizabeth clearly distains the Princess and finds her death just one more in a series of irritations, she wants to keep the mourning and funeral of her former daughter-in-law private.  Blair, however, thinks that would harm the monarchy in the eyes of the people who loved Diana, and urges the queen to go to London to speak publicly, fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, and be seen grieving.  Though she despises public displays of emotion, she reluctantly agrees.

Mirren gives a flawless impersonation of Elizabeth and James Cromwell is equally fine as grumpy Prince Phillip.  Sheen gives a sympathetic performance as Tony Blair, a young man who hopes to bring the monarchy into the modern age.  The palatial sets are grand and the ""behind the scenes"" peek at the Queen's private life is certainly enjoyable, but, as a non-Brit, I found the plot rather inconsequential and pointless.

her monarch is a appendix that the british people tormented between love and hate. having this monarch, the english people could differ and differtiate themselves from the other countries, to show other people that they are different, they still have a strong genealogy back to the old old time, even they might all admit privately  that this monarch is just a symbol, a tradition, a necessary evil. unlike the outcast run-away americans who got nothing but civil war, civil right movement, assassinations, mafia, riots, lobbyists, lying presidents and self-serving congress... trying so hard to dig into the short 200 some years history, only found there's not much to boast or to glorify. but on the other hand, they resent this monarch, resent their forever aristocratic luxury living style, collected tax from the common people before, exempt from paying any tax now, estranged from the daily struggles of the common majority.

this movie somehow tried to tell you, as your queen, i still have to deal a lot of difficulties, to burden a lot of must dos and must not dos.

but if you could stay more alert and focus during watching this movie, another hidden message was buried and exposed very subtle:

queen elizabeth morned the death of that magnificent deer more than the death of diana, the shameful mistaken marriage of the monarch.

she shared more emotion and empathy to the death of a reindeer than the death of diana.

to her ex daughter-in-law, queen elizabeth's husband showed the real feeling toward her death: ""served you right! thank god, finally! your death was a god send! finally we could put the shame and humiliation behind the monarch and move on!!""

queen elizabeth would rather rush to show her sadness over the death of a magnificent beast that roamed in her 40,000 acres private territory, she would never, if not forced by the poll, shed tears over the loss of her ex in-law.

yes, she still got feelings and concerns, but like she said, she'd rather keep for herself or only gave a little bit away to a wild animal instead of to a beautiful human being.

""give my congratulations to your guest. nice shot, good hunting..."" of course, visiting a dead animal, she didn't have to wear in black.

1562721,5,B00005JPAM,"Highly recommended to anyone who appreciates a good story, THE QUEEN recounts the first week after Diana Spencer's death from the perspective of Queen Elizabeth and Tony Blair, expertly portrayed by both Best Actress shoo-in Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen.

A well-organized collage of news footage and dramatic reenactments, this is a great movie that focuses on the royal family's steadfast refusal to address the British public about the former princess's fatal car crash - despite the prime minister's incessant pleas for the Queen to make a televised statement.

Though I suspect the Brits will see this differently, from my perspective, THE QUEEN is a study of head-in-the-sand loyalty to tradition and what happens when the unpredictable and unprecedented happens to inflexible, robotic royals. But I bet for the Brits, with a story as recent as this one, there are as many interpretations of this film as there are English citizens.

Regardless it's not just Mirren and Sheen who shine here.  James Cromwell (the farmer from Babe) plays a spot-on Prince Philip, the Queen's traditionalist husband.  Alex Jennings delivers a convincingly vulnerable Prince Charles, whose pesky ex-wife has suddenly captured his nation's vigilant sympathy.  And Helen McCrory offers a fascinating Cherie Blair, the prime minister's anti-monarchist wife who suspects her husband's sympathy toward the Queen stems from a son's respect for his stoic mother.

All in all THE QUEEN is a great flick that could entertain everyone, regardless of their interest in England's dysfunctional royal family.

1562722,4,B00005JPAM,"It's reassuring to see an actress of Helen Mirren's caliber finally receiving the top-line recognition she deserves for a role that must have been challenging to tackle without sinking into parody as others before her have. As Queen Elizabeth II, she manages to convey the immaculate decorum of her real-life counterpart without sacrificing the humanism essential in empathizing with her during a trying time. The period in question is the week that felt like an eternity after the death of Princess Diana in 1997 when the world was awaiting an official response from the Queen. With just a wig and glasses to alter her appearance, Mirren is superb in a role that must have been quite constraining given that the subject is not only still the reigning monarch but the model of blank-faced self-possession. Written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stephen Frears in a surprisingly dishy manner, the film actually plays out as a witty comedy of manners beset by a tragic event.

The 2006 film chronicles that momentous week and prefaces it with Tony Blair's first formal introduction to the Queen in May 1997 after his election as the first Labour Party Prime Minister in nearly two decades. Elizabeth's concerns over Blair's promises of modernity are expressed in small gestures, but obviously their values-based clash come to the fore when Diana is killed in a Paris car accident six months later. Cloistered at the time in their Scottish estate, Balmoral, the royal family does not support a public memorial for Diana since she had divorced Charles the previous year. However, public outcry over their seeming aloofness reaches a level of frenzy that places Blair in the difficult spot of requesting the Queen to speak to her subjects about what she considers a private matter. Exacerbating the situation is the residual animosity that the royal family feels toward Diana, whom they feel had betrayed them in the media.

While the story is fact-based, one can't help but believe the private moments are played with a certain amount of exaggerated tabloid-friendly bias, especially the frequently cutting swipes at Diana and the rather fanciful episode with the stag. It makes for some of the film's more entertaining moments, but concurrently they undermine the credibility of the account. Beyond Mirren, there is superbly comic work from James Cromwell as a blustery, unsympathetic Prince Philip; Alex Jennings as a grieving but oddly vacant and paranoid Prince Charles; Helen McCrory as Blair's curtsey-challenged, tough-minded wife Cherie; and Sylvia Syms (not the jazz singer) as the still-alert, eye-rolling Queen Mother. Initially, Michael Sheen looks like he will do a zealous parody of the real Blair, but he gains respectable gravity as the story progresses. Above all else, the film is a personal triumph for Mirren's stellar work in what may turn out to be the role of a lifetime.",1168128000,4,2891,5.09704641350211
1562723,5,B00005JPAM,"The British monarchy is an anachronism.  How in a modern society can we reconcile birth right privilege with progress and democracy?  The two should be mutually antagonistic.  In the long run, the monarchy will first be cast off by nations such as Canada and Australia.  In due course, its days will be numbered even in England.  Yet, in spite of its very anachronistic nature, it continues to draw breath.

The film, ""The Queen"" covers the events following the death of Princess Diana.  We are given an opportunity to look inside both the royal household and within 10 Downing Street.  It was the royal household that could not understand the outpouring of public grief over Diana's death.  It was Tony Blair that dragged the Queen reluctantly into an understanding of this grief.  I must admit that, at the time and still to this day, I cannot myself understand why so many people fell for Diana.  She was an intellectual lightweight who could be moody and self-indulgent.  Her end should have been little more than a historical footnote.  The fact that it wasn't is the real conundrum.

Helen Mirren is brilliant as the Queen.  She is totally plausible.  Indeed, the whole cast is quite stunning.  The cast allows the events to unfold while the viewer is swept along for the ride.  And a great ride it is!  Anyone over the age of twenty should be able to recall the events surrounding the death of Diana.  However, at no time is the film stale.  It is tense drama at its best!  I can thoroughly recommend this film.",1168041600,,1518,4.670454545454546

1562725,3,B00005JPAM,"Sometimes it's a hit or miss with directors, and with Stephen Frears at the helm the odds of a film being a success versus failure are about fifty/fifty. He has given us some excellent cinema such as High Fidelity, Dangerous Liaisons, and The Grifters. But sometimes his movie eye misses the mark or lacks an intriguing or well-rounded story. Mrs. Henderson Presents, Mary Reilly, and Hero are just a sprinkling of Frear films that had a good shot at being great, but ultimately failed in coherency, pacing, or some other aspect.

THE QUEEN is certainly a film with some great acting. Helen Mirren is spot-on as Queen Elizabeth II, as was Michael Sheen in his portrayal of Tony Blair. But from here the cast sags quite a bit. James Cromwell picked up the part of Prince Philip, but seemed very out of place since he has been typecast in such things as The West Wing TV series and The Sum of All Fears flick. And Sylvia Syms (as The Queen Mother) and Alex Jennings (as Prince Charles) were difficult to see in their respective roles since they are still in the public eye. Although Queen Elizabeth is still in the spotlight, Helen Mirren's strong portrayal made that role much easier to swallow.

Fresh subjects are tough to hit upon anyway, and you have to give credit where it is due; Stephen Frears certainly deserves some acclaim for simply attempting to make a film about the Royal Family and their reaction (or non-reaction) to Princess Diana's accidental death. But herein lies another problem: plot. There isn't one. The Queen is a reactionary tale, focusing mainly on Queen Elizabeth and the newly installed Prime Minister Tony Blair, and how each of them views the country's response to Di's death. Of course, the Queen deals with it by not dealing with it. While Mr. Blair continually tries to save the monarchy from self-destructing due to their own ignorance of the peoples' grief. But there isn't a definitive beginning, middle and ending to the story. It's character study of the monarchy will probably be boring to many, especially in the beginning. Most viewers may feel like dozing off after the first twenty minutes of disinteresting royal uppityness.

Although the beginning and middle of the film lag, the ending picks up just enough to make it watchable. The excellent shots of Balmoral Castle and its Scottish surroundings were fairly awesome, as were some analogies regarding the royal deer that roam the outback wildlands.

If you enjoy a good modern day character study, and are interested in the current monarchy, you'll probably eat this film up. But if you're eager for something plot-driven and deeply intriguing, you best look elsewhere.",1167177600,3,2667,4.86784140969163
1562726,4,B00005JPAM,"Great acting. Thought Charles was treated rather too well. He was having an affair all along. Otherwise, Mirren was really something. I'll get the DVD.",1166313600,4,151,5.08
1562727,4,B00005JPAM,"In spite of my initial lack of interest in the subject matter, ""The Queen"" is a compelling, soundly character-driven movie. Many of the events are necessarily fictionalized (understandably, no one in the royal family has publicly spoken of this time), but regardless of its literal accuracy, you really feel like you were there when it all happened - like you're peering into a secret world.

There's a strong emotional spine at the center of it - a public family struggling to reconcile their private grief with a very public one. It's a unique situation where age-old protocols are useless, and the royals have to make things up as they go along. Even if we can't directly empathize with this, Mr. Frears gives it an emotion that's clear and powerful.

The performances are uniformly excellent.  As it should be, any weaknesses in the actors' resemblance to their real-life counterparts is made a moot point.

Though well-paced, this is a film about restraint, and as such, may require a bit more patience.  Audiences who can accommodate a quieter piece will be richly rewarded.",1165276800,6,1080,4.94475138121547
1562728,4,B00005JPAM,"The mood of this film is very careful, reverent, and poised, much like Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth II. It plays out patiently over a very emotional issue for many people around the world: the death of Princess Diana and the reaction of the English monarchy.

Peter Morgan's script does an excellent job of presenting all sides of an historical moment. It never feels as if he's trying to garner sympathy for any parties involved. We see the queen trying to deal with the situation in the way that she sees fit: the most traditional, nonreactionary, unemotional way. We see Tony Blair trying to convince her that this is not the proper way to proceed. We see the public's reaction to Diana's death.

What struck me the most about the film was how the power of the media was displayed. In numerous scenes, the prime minister is shown scanning the headlines for the public's reactions. The queen is shown watching news reports of people's reactions. When Tony Blair attempts to side with the Queen slightly and help her the newspapers don't report it, they continue to report the queen's lack of action. To me, this brought into the equation the very real idea that while the government may rule, the media can decide what to say about events, and therefore effect public opinion in a much more direct way.

This film moves slowly, but is never boring. It definitely opens up many topics of conversation. This was a very well thought out and executed film.",1164844800,12,1456,4.724409448818897
1562729,4,B00005JPAM,"Director Stephen Frears using reels of archival footage created an insightful pseudo documentary surrounding the drama played out around the British royal family in the wake of the tragic death of Princess Diana.

Helen Mirren was at her frumpy and matronly best portraying Queen Elizabeth trapped in the quagmire of tradition in attempting to respond to Diana's demise.  The royals were represented as a privileged and aloof lot severely misjudging the outpouring of emotion of the British people indicative of their affection for the beloved princess.  This was shown most clearly through the heartless response of Prince Philip played by veteran actor James Cromwell.

While Prince Charles was played sympathetically by Alex Jennings, the real savior of the Brits was newly elected prime minister Tony Blair played superbly by Michael Sheen.  Blair while wafting through the proper etiquette in dealing with the queen, accurately judged the emotion of the British populace.  The Queen's lack of a public response to the tragedy was eroding her support throughout the country.  New kid on the block Blair advised the Queen to show some unrestricted emotion and compassion, which she ultimately did.

The movie featured a myriad of excellent acting performances yet tended to drag as this unforgetable calamity and drama played out before the unobscured view of the television cameras.",1164499200,3,1386,5.354838709677419
1562790,1,B00005JPAM,"In 1997, Tony Blair wins the peoples' vote to become Prime Minister. The Queen doesn't like this; apparently he is a modernist. However, she must follow proper protocol and ask him if he'll be prime minister. He says yes,  he and his wife back out of the room (never show your back to the queen), and then Princess Diana dies.

She and Prince Philip don't think it's any big deal, but Prince Charles actually has a tear in his eye, and raves about what a great mother she was. This makes the Queen feel as though he's putting down her mothering skills. Anyway, as we all remember, the public went crazy with grief, and expected the royals to share in it. But they didn't, and that's what this whole film is about, which makes it super boring.

Advisors are afoot everywhere, and Tony Blair finally talks the queen into coming back to London from her 40,000 estate in Balmoral. She happens to see a 14 point stag that her husband and grandkids have been stalking to get their minds off the death of their mother. Seeing the free and beautiful stag means something to her and she begins to cry (with her back to the camera). What does the stag mean? Does it represent Diana stalked by photographers, which some believe lead to her death? Or does the stag represent Diana as she was when married to Charles - stalked by the royal family trying to get her to change, never show her feelings, and put up with Charles having a mistress? OR, does the stag represent the Queen herself, roped into the monarchy due to her father's death, and feeling it's ""God's will"" that she is royalty, and must represent her people? Which she does by being filthy rich, being waited on hand and foot, and having 40,000 acre estates. The queen finds out later, that the stag was killed, having ""wandered"" off the 40,000 acres to another estate, where a paying guest wounded him, then a servant had to finish  him off. She makes a visit the stag's decapitated body, however, it doesn't show her going to pay her respects to Di. Is the stag a substitute?

What upsets the queen so much, is she can't believe that her people are making SUCH a fuss about Di's death, and that now 1 out of 4 have voted to abolish the monarchy. She feels as though she has given her life to these peasants, going around shaking hands with the poor, and they don't even appreciate it.  The queen believes that Great Britain was widely respected for its decorum in the face of tragedy, and that showing your emotions is simply not done.

However, to prevent an uprising and perhaps losing her castle, she bitterly and against her better judgment gives in to Tony Blair's (who has gone to the other side and become her champion)advice, goes back to London, looks at some flowers that mourners have placed there, and takes very personally the hand-lettered notes (""your blood is on their hands""). Bummer.

Well, it was all a very unpleasant affair, but now the Queen can go on about her business, without having to worry about Di causing any more headlines.",1163894400,8,3008,4.53690036900369
1562791,5,B00005JPAM,"The British royal family has weathered abdications, wars, and scandal. But one of the nastiest hits to them in the twentieth century came when Princess Di was killed.

And so ""The Queen"" tries to get inside the perfectly-permed head of the British Queen Elizabeth II, nearly ten years ago. Helen Mirren gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the title character, as she attempts to weather public and personal difficulties. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

The movie opens with the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), who comes to visit the queen (Mirren), despite being rather nervous about his new job. The country has been off balance ever since Di died in a car crash a few weeks ago, and her passing leaves the royals with mixed feelings. The queen decrees that since Diana divorced Prince Charles, she was no longer a royal, and her arrangements are to be left to her family.

What she doesn't realize is that the people ADORED Diana, and continue to adore her in the weeks that follow. Then the press joins in, berating the royal family for coldly ignoring the ex-princess, and heralding the Labour Party Blair. Her husband and mother think that she should continue doing nothing -- but the Queen has learned that sometimes the people need to be appeased.

""The Queen"" unfolds slowly like an old book, and Stephen Frears gives it the dignified gloss that usually belongs to older movies. Scenes that could have been maudlin or cliche are underplayed, which makes them more powerful. One example is of the queen peering in as Charles tells his young sons that their mother has died.

Fortunately, as in real life, there's also comedy as well as confusion and tragedy; Peter Morgan injects some humor when a nervy Blair meets the Queen for the first time. Morgan also spins u[ the kind of dialogue we can imagine the droll Elizabeth or prickly Prince Philip saying (""Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew. And they think WE'RE mad!"").

Mirren doesn't normally look much like Elizabeth II. She's younger, taller, and prettier. But with some padding and makeup, she manages to BECOME Elizabeth II. She's dignified, haughty, yet Mirren manages to bring across that she's bewildered and vulnerable as well. In short, she makes her version of Elizabeth II a person.

She's also backed by magnificent performances by Sheen and James Cromwell. Cromwell is excellent as the crotchety, stubborn Prince Philip, who thinks the best way to deal with grief is to go hunting. And Sheen is very good as the Prime Minister who is just starting his work, and who gains a new perspective on the royals.

""The Queen"" is a unique, quietly compelling film, as it explores what might have happened within the royal family -- and the person that Queen Elizabeth might be, underneath the royal mask.",1163808000,18,2832,4.836776859504132
1562792,5,B00005JPAM,"There has been a wide discussion of the story of the film so I will not go into a lot of detail in that regard.  The Queen is a well acted, thought provoking film.  I cannot comment on what might have been left out, was invented or compressed to tell the story of the Royal family in the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana but what we do see rings true with the information that is generally known.  The performance by Helen Mirren is Oscar caliber; my test for a performance is how convinced I am that the actor has become the role and Ms. Mirren is Queen Elizabeth II.  Indeed, the entire cast is superb.  Michael Sheen is terrific as Tony Blair and expresses a good range of emotion dealing sternly with his staff, diplomatically with the Queen and coping with family life.  James Cromwell is also good as Prince Philip exhibiting perhaps the ultimate stiff upper lip attitude of the English upper class. Equally good is Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother, who is most concerned, so it seems that Diana's public funeral is being based off her own.  Alex Jennings makes an interesting Prince Charles; although he does not look a lot like Charles he worked into his performance the Prince's mannerisms

The audience is treated to what amounts to the daily life of the Queen on summer holiday at the family estate at Balmoral.  This otherwise peaceful retreat is interrupted by the death of Princess Diana on August 30, 1997 and becomes a chronological telling of the events that occurs up to her funeral.  The film does not take a point-of-view and does not present very much about Princess Diana other than glimpses of her public life, which allows us to focus on how the Royal family dealt with her death.  It is going on ten years since the events depicted in the film occurred giving all of us a better perspective on what happened.  At the time, the Royal family came under harsh criticism for their perceived lack of reaction to Princess Diana's death; this film provides all sides and allows us to better understand the Queen and her reaction first to the death of the princess and then to the criticism of her conduct.

The episode of the stag in the film is one of the events that may be fictional but it serves to remind us that Princess Diana, like the stag, was hunted for her beauty.  The Queen makes this connection in the film and so her attempt to shoo the animal away when she encounters it and her quiet sorrow when he is killed.  I think that one comes away with a better understanding of Queen Elizabeth, and one can see the influence of past generations - that of her grandmother Queen Mary - in her attitude toward the public life that she inherited from her father.  The Queen is a thought provoking film that needs to be seen.",1163462400,18,2754,4.488977955911824
1562793,4,B00005JPAM,"I went to see this movie because I was a huge Princess Diana fan. When she was tragically killed it hit me (just like millions and millions of people around the world) very hard. She was so beautiful on the outside and on the inside. She was also very unique, because (perhaps?) she was the only member of this crazy family, the royals that had a heart and soul.

""The Queen"" stars legendary veteran actress Helen Mirren who plays the title role. ""The Queen"" deals with both the public's reaction to Princess Diana's tragic death, as well as the Queen's/royal family's cold and unsympathetic feelings towards this tragedy.

I am not sure if the producers of ""The Queen"" were trying to shed a positive light on Queen Elizabeth? If they were though, it would have been nice if they would have discussed her life in greater detail so the viewers could gain a better understanding in to this complex individual.

But after watching this picture I really believe that the Queen is a very cold person. She is more interested in what the press has to say about her and her family, but she is never seen comforting her grandchildren or even talking to them!

Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen was really scary because she looked just like her! I have no idea how the Queen behaves in private but I can only suspect that Helen Mirren was really on the money because she acted just the way most people would probably expect the Queen to behave.

Michael Sheen played the newly elected Tony Blair. Did anyone else find it odd that a prime minister of one of the richest countries in the world was portrayed as a desperately middle-class man in a very middle-class home? I found that very unrealistic.

Tony Blair tried to evoke some type of humanity into the Queen after it was apparent to the British people that she did not give a hoot about poor Princess Diana. He even acted as publicity agent, spinning stories about the Queen's departure from London and tight-lipped stance. It seemed that he was trying to play both sides of the fence though, although he did win much brownie points for his involvement during this tragic time in British history.

I found the performance of Helen McCrory (playing Mrs. Cherie Blair) to be top-notch as well. She was very comical in many scenes (her curtsey to the Queen was so different), and she also lent a little bit of realism to this picture. Because as Cherie described, the Queen and her entire family are a bunch of emotionally retarded people.

Princess Diana was the most famous women in the world. Is that why the Windsors disliked her? I can only suspect that the reasons why the public (and the world, alike) loved her so much were the same reasons why the royal family detested her. Such a shame...",1163376000,4,2746,4.601226993865031
1562794,5,B00005JPAM,"`The Queen' primarily looks behind the scenes of Buckingham Palace during the crisis of Princess Diana's death.  It is an illuminating and comprehensive affair that focuses mainly on the detachment of the Royal family in a time of national grieving.  Like many recent pieces of historical fiction, `The Queen,' wisely uses ample footage from real videotape.  Diana's death, Britain's mourning, and newscasts intersperse the drama.  This works well, and, while some of the screenplay is speculative, they nearly get all of it right.  Peter Morgan is a dead ringer as Prime Minister, Blair, and Helen Mirren is more than reminiscent of Elizabeth II.  Their rendering of Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) is a bullseye.  My only complaint is that, although we see plenty of The Queen's underbelly, her hard-boiled shell is mostly glossed over.  Elizabeth II has shown her vulnerability, but she can be much more indomitable than the drama suggests.  Perhaps this is presented because they couldn't go too far with this drama.  They understandably do try to be fair to the current monarch, even though they present her as grieving more over a slain stag than over any endearment to her estranged daughter-in-law's death.  Her grief is at her own perceived tarnished crown.  The funeral for her is a private affair.  And, here, Blair, who was in tune with the people, properly perceived the Royal Family would miss out on an opportunity to heal the nation.  He really has the dilemma, for he must balance the forces of those who wish to keep the Royal Family dignified and those who call to have their monarchy eliminated.  He draws from the sentiment of the people and properly eulogizes Diana's death, but balances becoming a laison for an institution he prudently realizes will never be put to death anytime soon.

Besides ""great performances"" the big draw should be taking in the subplot.  The scenes of Princess Di's private interviews, key scenes in her life, and the aftermath of her death provide the most poignant moments.  This isn't her movie, however, and it should be judged by the terms it was created.  The Queen's perspective brings about its own merits.  For who will not be struck about the state of affairs of England by looking upon the turmoil of the UK's most revered institution when it seems to remain aloof and stoic under the calamity of a competing fallen icon.  Although they prudently only present the suspect aspects that brought Diana's death, the whole picture becomes a fascinating composite of tragedy and regal isolation.",1163203200,3,2548,4.990521327014218
1562795,3,B00005JPAM,"Nothing could be me fitting to see a movie about British politics on the U.S.A. election day in the rain.  The title of this movie was deceptive as it concentrated almost exclusively on the week after Daian was killed in the car crash in Paris.  When I bought the ticket, I said ""I have come to see the Queen.""

We met her (played superbly by Helen Mirren) on Tony Blair's first day in office.  After being elected as Prime Minister of Britain, he is shown down on his knee asking Queen Elizabeth's permission to be ""her"" Prime Minister.  It was a factitious meeting to say the least.

The actor who portrasyed Blair was cute (showed a lot of teeth) and matured as the events occurred and he had to speak to the world on the family's behalf.  He was marvelous.  Diana died August 30, 1997, a lovely but deluded young woman who'd been ostracized by the royal family.  The monarchy watched t.v. like the rest of the world as they stayed in seclusion out in the country.  The Queen had deemed it a private Spenser family funeral, even though Charles had to remind her  of their responsibility, that Diana had been the loving mother of the future King of England.

As the Queen finally came to terms that she must make an appearance by September 4th, as worldwide disapproval was increasing, she shed a few tears (as I did when my ex mother-in-law died) and a beautiful stag appeared as a prominition.  It showed her humanity, though the whole family were old fashioned and set in their ways:  harsh, uncaring, in denial, thinking only of themselves instead of the two sons of Diana.

Blair carried on in a remarkably mature manner which won him many American admirers; almost ten years since those happenings, and he will retire in 2007.  He is almost as great now as Winston Churchill, even with his pajama top on which BLAIR was on the back.  He had a supportive wife and called Diana ""the people's princess.""  Plans were changed from private to a public funeral despite the Queen's cold attitute.

It was very moving to see her looking at the mountain of flowers outside the gates of Balmoral Castle and to have her stand, ""the flag,"" at half staff.  It was a minute-by-minute, day by day account of that terrible tragedy and repercussions in September, 1997.  We will always remember the televised coverage just as we watched the beautiful wedding some years prior, which led up to this miserable day, and the funeral proceedings of JFK in 1962.

Some things are so remarkable that you can't get them erased from your memory, and the pain is always there.  I wasn't expecting this when I went to the movie, as I avoid painful memories in my subconscious as much as I can.  I could not see the 9-11 movie, but sometimes after we re-live emotional, painful situations there is a cleansing which is theraputic -- and this movie fits the bill in that aspect.  Go see it, or buy the video.  It is a good, though different, interpretation of how Diana was finally made a ""Queen"" in spirit.  Long Live The Queen in Heaven and on earth.",1163030400,3,3029,4.550831792975971
1562796,5,B00005JPAM,"I very much looked forward to an excellent performance by Helen Mirren and my wish was granted. I had seen an interview with Mirren in which she mentioned how a photograph of Elizabeth at the age of 12 had served as a catalyst for her interpretation of the role. I'm sure other performances were worth a word or two but I am not able to do them justice. I was saddened that Charles was reduced to a couple of grimaces, afraid of Mum, and forced to try and woo others to implement his wishes. I would rather have seen a more rounded portrayal -- something to balance the presence of Diana. Truth be known, however, I considered the possibility of beautifully shot images of the Corgis worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, for me, the scenes in which they capered or stopped dead in their tracks were scarce. The film seems first-rate. It gives almost everyone a shot at being understood; exceptions being the caricatures of the Queen Mother and Prince Phillip, and puts everything in perspective by revealing the beauty of Balmoral, a handsome stag, and a passel of very polite people I enjoyed watching. If you're wondering about the emphasis on the pups, yes, I have a beautiful Corgi at home who brings me much joy.",1162857600,7,1225,4.623853211009174
1562797,5,B00005JPAM,"The most surprising thing about this film is that it doesn't really take sides. Instead it examines the personal responses & political decisions made by Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Tony Blair during the week following Lady Diana's tragic death. Though both Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen give outstanding Oscar-worthy performances the real star/hero of this film is, as you might expect, Lady Di.

Most people already know that virtually everyone in the world adored Lady Di while she was alive and that many experienced her death almost as a personal loss; and that many people continue to view her as one of the late twentieth-century's most intriguing and personable icons. Frears certainly knows the iconic value of Lady Di and just how she was and continues to be perceived by not only the British people but the people of the world. To the people of the world she is a person who embodied glamor and grace in a way no public figure had done before or has done since, and on top of that she bravely defied the life-denying royal protocols and out-of-date traditions that were no longer responsive to the people's needs and merely put a great chasm between the royals and real life. While the rest of the royals went about their merry way blissfully out-of-touch with the way they were being perceived by the modern world and blissfully dysfunctional as human beings, Lady Di was the one person who remained in touch with her instincts and emotions and in touch with the people. And it was these displays of genuine human qualities and emotion in interview after interview that gave people something to connect with and admire. Lady Di's attempt to break free from the old royal ways represented to the English people their own desire to break free from the stultifying confines of tradition. One could say that Lady Di was a modern in a house full of ancients (who still believed it was ok for Prince Charles to have a mistress; and to hunt stags and foxes just for fun). Even though Lady Di had no real political power she had tremendous symbolic power and when she died Tony Blair, because he knew what she represented to the people, immediately appreciated how deeply her loss would be felt. Tony Blair also immediately appreciated that it was important not to try and turn Lady Di's death into an opportunity for personal political gain even though the opportunity was there. But without even trying, or simply by trying to do the decent thing and not the most advantageous thing politically Blair came across as a decent guy and a guy that acted and thought like Lady Di herself who always put people before politics.

To the royals, however, Lady Di was just a thorn in their side and her death only aggravated an already deep wound. To them her open defiance of royal ways was an assault on English tradition and decorum and her affiliations with celebrities and playboys as well as her open criticism of Charles and the rest of the royals in the press just seemed undiginified and vulgar. To the people of course Lady Di's dalliances seemed like much deserved breaths of fresh air after years of royal confinement. Though Lady Di never espoused any political views of her own, her highly publicized struggles with the royal family forever wounded the publics image of all things royal. Still, despite these well publicized differences, the public expected the Queen to be magnanimous and to eulogize Lady Di in some public way. The British and world press certainly did not expect the Queen to be petty but that is exactly how the British and world press perceived the Queen's week-long silence that followed that fatal car crash in Paris.

In many ways Lady Di remains the star of this picture. Every time we see another interview or any video footage of her we are in awe of how powerful her image was and remains. The Queen, on the other hand, is not loved and no one knows this more than she. But she is not portrayed here as simply the much maligned princess-nemesis that you might expect. This film takes an equivocal approach and allows us an insiders glimpse in to how the story played out in both the royal and Blair households that week in 1997 and the film also allows us to understand exactly why each person responded the way they did. By allowing us an especially close behind-the-scenes look at the inner-workings of two very distinct political minds with very different social & political backgrounds and points of view we find, to our surprise, that Tony Blair and the Queen, as far apart as they are on the political spectrum, do indeed have something in common: a respect for decency and a sense of themselves as selfless public servants; and even though they show that decency and play their roles in radically different ways both ultimately come off as essentially decent people and by films end we even feel that these two may get on rather nicely. And so the real revelation here is that the Queen mum is actually a human being who just isn't that good at relating with her subjects and Blair's the guy who is credited with providing the Queen with some much needed emotional counsel & public relations advice. What we see is a Queen that does hold an obvious grudge against Diana but we also see that she needs her subjects emotional support just as much as they need her public display of emotion. This is trying for her because she is not used to showing emotion publicly, in fact she's been trained all of her life not to show emotion and Blair is sensitive to this generational difference in attitude toward what is and is not appropriate. Its only Tony Blair himself who sees what the Queen is really like and its only Blair who can finesse the Queen into reversing her earlier miscalculation and to make a public statement in recognition of Lady Di without making her feel publicly or politically humiliated. Blair is sensitive to public opinion but he also realizes that the press and the public are not always spot-on when it comes to assessing the lives of public figures, especially their inner lives. His public sympathies are with the very popular Lady Di but privately his sympathy is, surprisingly, with the Queen.

As the Queen, Mirren gives a touching performance, and one full of the kinds of subtleties and nuances that only the worlds greatest actresses are capable of delivering. Her skill is not just in making the Queen likable but also in allowing us to comprehend this profoundly conservative woman. Mirren gives her humor and heart, and the scene where we see the Queen suddenly and unexpectedly overcome by the grief that she actually feels is as surprising to us as it is to her.

What's so graceful about this film is its ability to use the Lady Di tragedy as a way to heal both personal and political wounds, and to find  the higher common ground that unites people of all political persuasions. The films idealism is a worthy tribute to the legacy of Lady Di. The Queen is an easy film to like and one of the rare films that actually makes you feel good.

The press takes a good slapping on the wrist and they deserve it but they are not the only ones villainized. The real bad guys here are the ones who pay closer attention to politics than to people and thus live in their heads instead of their hearts. In the royal household the Queen's husband, Prince Philip, comes off as not just emotionally cold but rather indifferent to the Lady Di tragedy and to human feeling in general; his own emotional life, stunted as it is, provides him with no way of comprehending the depth of public feeling that Lady Di inspires. The only emotion that he seems capable of expressing is resentment; he has no real feeling for the people, and the people none for him. He represents the royals at their worst as he lives in a cocoon of privilege completely cut-off from real world events. In comparison, Prince Charles actually comes across as well-intentioned and capable of compassion and sympathy; although he is portrayed as painfully awkward and hopelessly ineffectual as a public figure, he is also potrayed as a good father, and a caring ex-husband. Although funny and witty and in many ways very likable because always ready with a clever quip or retort Blair's key analyst/speechwriter, Alastair Campbell, does not come off much better than the Queens' husband in the final analysis as he is incapable of seeing the Lady Di tragedy as anything but a political opportunity. Though its Mirren as the Queen and Michael Sheen as Blair that will win Oscar nods (and deservedly so) this subtle portrait of a scheming progressive also deserves notice.",1162771200,7,8616,4.701986754966887
1562798,5,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirren is getting the requisite kudos for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth.  But there's another portrayal in Stephen Frears' excellent film of an equally public figure that is going relatively overlooked: Michael Sheen's spot-on take on Tony Blair.  I was totally mesmerized at just how perfectly Sheen had both the look and feel of the unbridled optimism of TB at the outset of his first term.  That's key because it's Blair's intuition on  the matters at hand here that are instrumental in shaking the Royal Family out of their tone-deaf dismissal of the unfolding events across the country.

It's interesting to see the portrayals here and see how harsh or sympathetic they are (Mirren's Elizabeth is complex and beyond analysis here):

Prince Philip - A devastating take on him

Price Charles - Painted very sympathetically by Alex Jennings, but obviously cowed by his mother

Alastair Campbell - A very positive take on New Labour's wordsmith by Mark Bazeley (I'm a big Campbell fan, so it was good to see the script honor his contributions to Blair's early successes).

Queen Mom - Yikes!  Not a very pretty picture

Frears' delicate and respectful approach keeps William and Harry just off the picture.

What will really take you about the movie is this: as many reviewers here note, they found themselves strangely moved and shocked by Diana's death, like she was a member of the family.  When those scenes play out here, wow, you'll be quite surprised at the emotions that well up in you.  It will happen.  Trust me.

Frears - as pitch-perfect movie helmsman - includes the stirring end portion of the eulogy penned and intoned by Charles, Earl of Spencer (Diana's brother).  Spencer's speech is generally regarded as one of the finest eulogies ever rendered.  It has become a part of British textbooks.  Here's the part you hear in the movie:

""I would like to end by thanking God for the small mercies he has shown us at this dreadful time. For taking Diana at her most beautiful and radiant and when she had joy in her private life. Above all we give thanks for the life of a woman I am so proud to be able to call my sister, the unique, the complex, the extraordinary and irreplaceable Diana whose beauty, both internal and external, will never be extinguished from our minds.""

That will send a chill up your spine when you see it in the theater.",1162684800,149,2367,4.73838630806846
1562799,4,B00005JPAM,"I just viewed the film ""The Queen"" today after traveling well over an hour to a theatre that is not afraid to show movies that actually have quality at heart and not just box-office results. I find it, first, a shame that most people will not see this movie, nor, probably, will never even hear of it. It is truely a movie that was made for two reasons, the first being to actually make a well-produced, directed, and acted film. The second, to bring a very real and timely issue to the screen in the hopes that people will see it for what it truely is.

The film begins on the second day of May in 1997 shortly after Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) is elected as Prime Minister of Great Britain in a landslide victory. Queen Elizabeth (Helen Mirren), of course, is grudgingly forced more or less into offering him the job which obviously he accepts with the ideas of modernization and advancement of the country at heart. Skip ahead several months and move the scene to Paris on that fateful night of Princess Diana's car accident and death at the hands of the paparazzi. A several brief phone calls later and the entire English Royal family is awake and watching the news for further up date except the young William and Harry.

""How are the children, Charles"" asks Mirren.

""I've decided not to wake them until we have further word on the matter"" answers Prince Charles (Alex Jennings).

And so begins the struggle that each family must go through when one of their own dies; or is Diana really one of their own? To the English populist, who instantly begin attacking the royal family for showing no sign of grief or remorse; while interiorly the queen orders continuously that ""this is a private matter.""

Blair is caught in the crossfire as the newly elected Prime Minister and must decide if he should side with the people or his sovereign. Trying to easy the tension between the two Blair must face off with the queen with polite, respectful, graceful tact and show the people too that the government is doing something out of all the chaos of this unexpected and troubling event.

""The Queen"" is not a tabloid into the lives of the royal family; and only hints at the affair between Charles and Cammila, the supposed hatred Elizabeth and Philip have towards Diana, and inner workings of the public versus private funeral arrangements for Diana that may or may not have been stirred up out of malice, but rather shows the tame, more than likely, real life scenerio and roles played by every one who participated in them. The hatred and spite, if any, in refusing to have a public funeral was not so far as to have Elizabeth publically condemning Diana, but more so as a way to protect her grandchildren from the same fate that Diana, her whole life after being married into the royal family, spent in the presses eye. Overall the production shows the inner, much more humane, and understanding nature of the royal family than the one painted by the press.

As for the film itself; production wise, it was a very nuanced approach to a subject that could have easily been reduced to an hour episode of 'Jerry Springer'. Not that I did not have my qualms about certain aspects of the movie, particularly the presences of the Queen Mother. Sylvia Syms' protrayal is nothing to be criticized, but rather the character in the screenplay always seems to be the comic relief. The 'old, senile, fat lady' who is always there for a good laugh, but really serving no other purpose than that was, unfortunatly, all she was good for in the film. But that minor detail, though so what annoying on film, was such a minor glich in an otherwise well made production.

As for performances; James Cromwell (yes, that James Cromwell) as Prince Philip makes an equally headstrong, subborned partner for Elizabeth and both play off each other well. Jennings as Charles casts the Prince in a rarely seen sympathetic light as a man who did have grief to deal with after his ex-wife's death. Applause definitely go out to Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, a family man at heart who, as an outsider, eventually sees the understandable reasonings behind Elizabeth and family's privacy in the midst of both scandal and sorrow.

But the real star of the show is of course Helen Mirren, in a performance as powerful, haunting, and exact that one actually forgets this is an actress portrayal and completely believes this is in fact Elizabeth the Second, Queen of England. As the title says, Mirren is definitely the queen, and it certainly would be a royal sin if this actress did not finally win an Oscar that she has so desperately earned on many occasion with her portrayals on film. Helen Mirren, along with Meryl Streep, is the most talented and versatile actress working in entertainment today.

Without a doubt, 'The Queen', is easily one of the ten best films of the year; the director of 'Dangerous Liaisons' and 'Mrs. Henderson Presents' has created a stirring and important film that addresses the subjects of both the paparazzi and the private affairs of those constantly in the public eye and the portrayal they are given by the journalists and other media sources to the public as opposed to their actually workings in dealing with such issues that can have enough sorrowful impact upon them personally, let alone having the entire world watching and judging them as they grieve.",1162684800,7,5360,4.6925531914893615
1562859,5,B00005JPAM,"Stephen Fears follows one ""A"" movie ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" with yet another of the same quality, ""The Queen."" Most of the film has to do with the week or so after the untimely death of Princess Diana and the royal family's reaction to it and their totally misjudging the public's reaction. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, because of their icy stoicism and, more importantly, their total distaste for the princess, were all set to stay at Balmoral, ignore the press, make no public statement, have a small private funeral and let Prince Philip take Princess Diana's sons hunting to divert them from their sorrow. The royal couple, as the whole world now knows, got their comeuppance, and at the eleventh hour, managed to do the right thing but not without the help of a very determined Tony Blair.

The acting is excellent with only the Queen Mother being miscast. Dame Helen Mirren convinces you she is the queen; both Prince Philip and Prince Charles are believable; and Michael Sheen gives an outstanding performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair (""Just call me 'Tony'""). The movie belongs just as much to the prime minister as to the queen. There is a scene near the end of the film when Blair has an audience with Queen Elizabeth and she reminds him of the fickleness of the public. We are reminded, rather sadly, that he bought into a war that ultimately cost him his position.

Although Fears of course covers the death and funeral of Princess Diana (""the people's Princess""), he does it with grace and respect and never  exploits the sad events. For example, her sons never speak nor are seen closeup. Additionally the actual footage of events at the time is so well integrated with the rest of the movie so that the two are indistinguishable, no small feat on the part of both the director and cinemaphotographer.

The critics are already talking about an Oscar nomination for Mirren. She richly deserves one.",1162684800,3,1922,4.7975830815709966
1562860,5,B00005JPAM,"""The Queen""  is, far and away, Stephen Frears' best film to date.  That's saying a lot since his ""Dangerous Liasions"" is one of my favorite films of all time.  While ""Dangerous Liasions"" is about power and cruelty,  The Queen allows you a glimpse behind the scenes of power, and illustrates that everyone, no matter how famous or how powerful, stumbles a little in life, and fortunately has a person or persons around them  that save them from themselves.

A study in contrasts of style and substance is the theme of the film -- the events that brought together Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) and her new Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen).  Had it not been for the sudden, almost inexplicable death of the tragic Princess Diana, followed by the schism in terms of reaction between her people and the Queen, Elizabeth and Tony may have taken years to get comfortable with one another, years to understand each other, years to forge the kind of relationship that works for the UK.

These two actors are brilliant in their roles.  Mirren goes beyond the traditional caricature of the Queen as stodgy, opinionated, and totally in control/disdain of her family members' lives and foibles.  She gives us the Queen as an extraordinary woman made humble by events she did not create and could not fathom.  Her reaction to them, her eventual awareness and response, is, for lack of a better word, queenly.  Mirren, the redoubtable Jane Tennyson of the brilliant ""Prime Suspect"" series, is the best actress of her time (yes, Meryl Streep, that includes you).  Michael Sheen, on the other hand, may not portray Tony Blair as he really is (how would I know?) but the contrast of his coltish, disarming charm and his leadership style at the beginning of his term as Prime Minister (and the obvious affection from staff and family,  for his ability to be real, to be the kind of leader that one would follow into hell )  to his growing confidence that he can, by the truth of his understanding and  his willingness to continue to persevere, to bring the tragedy from the brink, all of it is captured in his performance.

Frears benefits from a brilliant script by Peter Morgan, but turns the script into an extraordinary film by the perfection of his choices and his editing.  He chooses to recreate scenes that have never been filmed (the crowd in front of the hotel before Diana emerged to her car and her subsequent death the scene of Charles arriving at the hospital) and mixes them with real film clips of Diana in life, and some of the real film of the funeral events.  Choosing NOT to recreate Diana with an actress was sheer genius, and the mix of clips and live action was incredibly well done.  Mixing the filmmaker's/writer's interpretation of what must have happened in the series of entreating phone calls between Blair and the Queen, making both vulnerable by showing little shots of daily life -- the cozy, contemporary chaos of the Blair house, the deliberacy of the Queen taking off and putting on her glasses, tells the story of how the power shifted between them (perhaps?) in a way that not even his fine actors could do.  Choosing  a breathtaking but not imposing score for the film and making the shots of Balmoral ( the almost forbidding surroundings) come to life as the barrier between the Queen and her people...well, Frear has taken what could be an ordinary, dull film about a living monarch to the realms of an incredible character study, played out against a backdrop that stands stark in the memory of people all over the world.

Was the crown really endangered by Elizabeth's reaction to the tragedy?  Did she change her stance because of the leverage of Blair's campaign, his truth?  Is Frears film opinion, or is it reality?  Somewhere in the middle?  It matters not.  It's unique, it's powerful, it's a shame that it won't be viewed in wider release, because it is the best film, so far, this year.",1162684800,3,3931,4.724340175953079
1562861,5,B00005JPAM,"While most civilians may grumble at the antics of their problematic kin, at least those personal dramas don't play out under an excruciating media microscope.  Anyone who has become a public figure--whether by choice or happenstance--isn't so lucky.  The Queen explores the tensions between public and private lives, with the clash between traditional decorum and popular celebrity culture forming much of the drama at the story's core.

The film opens with Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), newly-elected prime minister of the UK, having his first awkward audience with Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren).  She reminds him that he's her tenth Prime Minister--the first was Churchill--establishing the tenor of their uneasy relationship.  Her message couldn't be more clear: prime ministers may come and go, but the monarchy is forever.

Fast-forward a few months to September, 1997.  Diana, the Princess of Wales, has just been killed in a Paris car crash, prompting an outpouring of grief among the nation's people.  Elizabeth and the other royals, ensconced at Balmoral, immediately close ranks.  Diana was no longer a member of their family, they maintain, and therefore her funeral should be a private matter, arranged by the Spencer clan.  Blair, meanwhile, has to deal with both the public's grief and their outrage at the royals' stony silence, while simultaneously trying to press Elizabeth into some kind of public gesture.

The script by Peter Morgan, directed by Stephen Frears, deftly weaves the fictional narrative in with news footage from the week between Diana's death and her funeral.  The choices of archival material are outstanding, incorporated so perfectly into the script that the line between fiction and history blurs.  Morgan doesn't try to pretend that Diana was some kind of saint--it's pointed out that the woman the royal family knew and the ""people's princess"" were very different women--but neither does he vilify her memory, and the public's grief at Diana's death comes across palpably.  It's almost impossible not to be moved by the crowds of mourners and the vast sea of flowers piled up at the gates of Buckingham Palace.

The engine that propels the narrative is the conflict between Elizabeth and Blair, with all their aides and servants circling around.  They couldn't be more different: she's elderly, austere, and regal; he's young, informal, and almost puppy-like in his exuberance.  Mirren and Sheen play off each other beautifully, and the constant friction between the two characters is a source of both humor and drama.  Their opposing viewpoints are presented pretty fairly: Elizabeth wants to keep things quiet and dignified, while the more modern Blair realizes that Diana's vast popularity has created extraordinary circumstances that traditional ""arrangements"" can't really cope with.

The supporting players add much to the production.  Particularly good is Helen McCrory as Cherie Blair, her husband's compliment in every way--warm and funny, modern, sexy, and emotionally accessible.  The staff members in Blair's office are also terrific, lending a very West Wing flavor to the Blair administration; there's a running joke where one aide keeps bursting in to tell the PM how his approval rating is climbing in response to the crisis.  The characters' warm camaraderie leaves the viewer wanting more, always a good thing.

The royals come across as one might expect: Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is a crusty boor, the most hard-line traditionalist, though some of his observations are spot-on and screamingly funny.  Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) is portrayed more or less sympathetically as a man caught between his domineering parents and his ex-wife's celebrity.  Sylvia Syms is great fun as the Queen Mother, providing much of the humor (her reaction when she realizes Diana's funeral will be based around plans for her own--because it's the only funeral that's been rehearsed--is just priceless).  Princes William and Harry are only glimpsed from behind, probably because they were still quite young at the time of their mother's death.  The bevy of servants and secretaries is excellent.

Uniformly stellar performances really sell this movie.  Any number of superlatives has been heaped on Mirren for her performance, all of them deserved.  She rarely lets the queen's resolute self-control drop, but underneath the starchy surface, there's a lot of emotion going on, and Mirren lets the viewer see that with the subtlest gestures and expressions.  She does a marvelous job conveying Elizabeth's slow change of heart, her annoyance with Blair (and her ultimate respect for him), her concern for her grandsons, and her profound sense of duty to her country.  In perhaps her best scene, Elizabeth finally returns to London to make a public appearance; Mirren's expressions are fabulous as the queen takes in the mourners and the flowers, realizing viscerally the extent of people's grief.

Mirren has a terrific foil in Sheen, who also hits every note perfectly as Blair, from the prime minister's awkwardness around the queen to his frustration with her and eventually his admiration for her when she addresses the people.  The two share a scene at the film's end where Elizabeth cautions Blair that one day the public will turn on him, unexpectedly, just as it turned on her, an open, honest exchange that perfectly bookends their initial meeting at the opening of the movie.

The visuals are top-rate as well, bringing life and depth to the characters' worlds.  Balmoral looks like a big old hunting lodge--all wood and earth tones, stags' heads mounted on the walls--and the surrounding countryside is breathtaking in its rugged wildness.  The Blairs' home is warm and cluttered, covered with their children's artwork, and that cozy informality extends right into the prime minister's office.  The shots of the various characters in their sleepwear are both hilarious and poignant: Elizabeth wears a big fuzzy bathrobe, and Blair wears a sports jersey with his name on the back.  These intimate portraits really help sell the characters as flesh-and-blood people: the queen fumbling for her glasses in the middle of the night, the prime minister watching telly while munching down a bowl of cereal.  Ultimately it is these moments of humanity that make the film so enjoyable, the glimpses--even fictional--of the private lives behind the public faces, the inward and outward responses to tragedy and loss.

The Queen isn't playing in wide distribution (yet), but it's well worth the time to seek out.  For anyone who enjoys interpersonal drama, great character work, and superb acting, movies don't get much better than this.",1162512000,6,6686,5.2747875354107645
1562862,5,B00005JPAM,"This may well be the movie of the year. Helen Mirren, as just about everybody has rightly noted, turns in another wonderful performance, this time as the restrained ""duty first, self second"" monarch.  Her particular trial here is having to face a clash of civilizations, not between nations as during World War Two, but now within her own country.  A culture of heroes, of maintaining a stiff upper lip during crises and of ""good show, flying colors"" as the behavioral ideal, has slowly eroded and been replaced by one of vulgar celebrity and ""letting it all hang out."" In the middle of this clash stands Tony Blair. He must induce the noble yet now unintentionally comic, because isolated, queen into an awareness of how her society has been ""Oprahfied,"" an insight that would not naturally occur to her since she sees Diana's death as calling for little more than royal privacy and a family removal to Balmoral. Herein lies the movie's subtlety. The high-minded, stoic queen, for all her wit, nonetheless values brute animals more easily, apparently, than she does people. She quickly sees, for example, the beauty of a glorious stag pursued by royal hunters, but has little sympathy for the beautiful Diana pursued by equally murderous reporters.

 As regards Tony Blair, we have equivalent complexity. For all the film reveals of his political opportunism and readiness to take advantage of changed circumstances, for all the emphasis on generational differences between him and the queen, he is allowed by the well-written script to genuinely recognize the queen's essential fineness. His awareness here leads him in an emotionally charged scene to berate some of his own staff in private after they openly express their shameless glee at the queen's discomfort. At the same time as he recognizes that the ""duty' agenda of the queen will allow him to talk her into doing what has become in present circumstances ""the right thing,"" he also reveals to us his clear awareness that something fine has been compromised in the process.",1162425600,3,2034,5.008875739644971
1562863,5,B00005JPAM,"After watching this drama-documentary, the question probably weighing on my mind as well as others in here who have seen this film is.... How would Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth (the real one, not Dame Mirren) and the rest of her family react if they were to sit down and watch this film from beginning to end? I imagine that dear old Liz would not be very amused at all.

Having said that, if Stephen Frear's ""The Queen"" does not win best picture at the Golden Globe Awards in Los Angeles this next spring, then I will be very shocked. Helen Mirren has given her performance of a life time. The way she walks, the way she behaves and speaks, all the way down to the real Queen's trademark hairstyle is uncanny. If I were to see Mirren impersonating the real Queen on the street, I would have thought that she was the real monarch. She has gotten it all spot on!

The Duke of Edinburgh, played by James Cromwell acted like a complete jerk. I wonder if Philip is like this in real life? Besides the comic relief of the Queen Mother who I found hilarious, as well as a skiddish Prince of Wales, where were the rest of The Queen's family, namely Andrew, Edward, and Anne? I also found it a little odd that William and Harry were not a large part of this story. I was relieved when they did not cast someone to play the part of Princess Diana. Instead they relied on real footage of the Princess just prior to her tragic death in Paris.

This was an excellent film and it deserves 5 stars. Well worth the $7.50 I spent for an afternoon viewing at the theatre.",1162425600,3,1553,4.311643835616438
1562864,4,B00005JPAM,"First, I'd like to reiterate what everybody else has said - Helen Mirren's portrayal of Queen Elizabeth is superb. Her portrayal was very believable and sympathetic, as she showed a woman who, in the words of my dad, ""thought she was popular with the people, but found out that she wasn't nearly as popular as Diana, and that really shook her.""

This movie is absorbing, thoughtful, revealing... and ironic. It's entitled ""The Queen,"" a title which would imply that it would cover the life of Elizabeth. In fact, this movie primarily covers a single week in her very long life as queen. And then, at the end of the movie, Tony Blair basically tells her that the week of Diana's death would just be a blip in people's memories - that people would remember Elizabeth for all of the things she'd done in her lifetime as queen, and not just for her reaction to Diana's death. But apparently that's not the case, if this movie is any indication.",1162252800,,940,4.595238095238095
1562865,4,B00005JPAM,"Helen Mirren's work has always been superlative and I have always enjoyed the tough, determined and tempestuous Jane Tennyson in her Prime Suspect series. She has acted a very broad range being light,funny and flirtatious in some parts and stoic and reserved in others.

 ""The Queen"" is not one of those pick you up and whip you around emotional movies. It is done in the same way that the queen is, stoic, determined and with little display of emotion. Although you get the very strong sense that she does have very deep emotions and what really matters to her. Helen Mirren coming from the British Theatre actually knows how to act and portray those emotions. American actors should do the same. We rely on gizmos,computers and explosions. One exeption would be Clint Eastwood in some of his ""off"" movies like Bridges of Madison County and Unforgiven (although popular). ""The Queen"" isn't gripping, but it is illuminating. The queen as portayed in this movie was part of ""The Great Generation"" who stoicly, quietly and with great determination and faith in God endured the terrible bombings in WWII and the horrific loss of life in the trenches of WWI and the hedgerows and freezing winters of WWII. We should remember this.  And Helen did a masterful job.",1162080000,4,1258,4.841860465116279
1562866,5,B00005JPAM,"We really didn't need any further proof that Helen Mirren is one of the greatest actresses alive, but yet again she proves that to be true with her performance in ""The Queen."" The film itself uses the death of Princess Diana as a metaphor for the modernization of the UK. Tony Blair (a brilliant Michael Sheen), in convincing HM Elizabeth II to make unprecedented showings of grief to the public, illuminates the UK's gradual distancing from the overly strict traditions of the monarchy and into a new, more Republic type of society. The Queen is aware of this, and through Mirren's nuanced performance we see the Sovereign shift from a protocol-following figurehead to a more accepting and approachable woman. The whole movie of course rests on Helen Mirren, and she in turn is incredible- warm (to a point), witty, fiercely regal and independent, she oozes integrity. The movie itself was brilliant in using a very recent historical event to illuminate the changing culture(s) in one of the oldest and strictest countries on Earth. It's impossible not to be impressed.",1162080000,2,1070,4.983240223463687
1562867,4,B00005JPAM,"I can clearly recall that Saturday night in 1997 when I first heard that Princess Diana had been killed. Strangely her death hit me pretty hard as if she were a part of my immediate circle of family and friends.

What had Diana meant to me and to millions around the world? And why did we all take her death so personally?

Stephan Frears' ""The Queen"" doesn't deal with these Diana questions much but her death is the engine that pulls this film along to its inevitable conclusion. What he does deal with is Queen Elizabeth's (a perfectly stiff-upper lipped Helen Mirren...a performance without irony and definitely one of respect) reaction, or more to the point, non-reaction to Diana's death.

Frears, best known for edgy dramas as in the terrific ""The Grifters"" and ""My Beautiful Launderette"" directs here with restraint and reverence which in most cases would translate to stodgy and dull. But Frears, ever the consummate artist treats the material with panache, taking advantage of the political, social and emotional nature of this situation to elevate the material to drama, riveting drama

 In 1997, Tony Blair (a dull, odd, Michael Sheen) had just been elected on a platform of change and modernism and meets with a wall that is the implacable Queen and the Royal family who are intent on adhering to tradition which meant that Diana, as no longer a member of the royal family, would not deserve a State funeral. But the English people, who loved Diana as well as People from all over the world persuaded, along with Tony Blair, Queen Elizabeth to change her mind.

""The Queen"" is very well made and generally well acted though Alex Jennings who plays Prince Charles seems to be in a constant state of indecision and confusion and who perpetually seems to be smelling poop.

It's been 9 years since that August night in Paris but if anything Diana's fame is bigger now than ever. ""The Queen"" does nothing to diminish Diana's fame and of course, she will always remain young and beautiful in our eyes and memories. What ""The Queen"" does though is to buff up the tarnished reputation of the English Monarchy by making them as human-like as any film has ever done. And that is not an easy task to perform.",1161907200,5,2211,4.7272727272727275
1562868,5,B00005JPAM,"THE QUEEN seems like one of those biographical features that would be difficult to hold anyone's interest - on the surface, without the benefit of knowing much about the content.  Queen Elizabeth II is not exactly a figure who generates anything but a response of boredom, so flat and uninteresting is her persona.  But enter Helen Mirren, one of the finest actresses on the screen today, and this potentially boring potentate becomes a vibrantly detailed and fascinating portrait of a queen at odds with the times.  It is a staggering achievement.

Director Stephen Frears, using a superb script by Peter Morgan, details the time from the election of Labor Party Prime Minister Tony Blair (a brilliant Michael Sheen) to that momentous international outpouring of grief and love that followed the tragic death of Princess Di in 1997, showing the bifurcation of response between the Royals and the People as represented by Blair.  Instead of the insensitive cold figure that the world witnessed as QE II, Mirren shows us that the woman who is Queen actually had feelings for her grandchildren, a respect for her station as royalty,  and was gradually responsive to the cry of the people via Blair's influence, allowing the world to pay proper tribute to a heroine.  The ogres in the Balmoral Castle were in fact Prince Phillip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mum (Sylvia Syms) abetted by the very proper Robin Janvrin (Roger Allam) and the wishy washy Prince Charles (Alex Jennings).

The entire production is beautifully filmed with the use of clips from Princess Di's life (and death) instead of creating an actress role to portray her - a very wise choice.  The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is superb (with a little help from Verdi's 'Libera Me' as sung by Lynn Dawson and the BBC chorus for the funeral portion).  But indeed the accolades go to Helen Mirren in an Oscar worthy performance - with the very strong counterbalance by Michael Sheen.  An excellent film about a moment no one will ever forget.
