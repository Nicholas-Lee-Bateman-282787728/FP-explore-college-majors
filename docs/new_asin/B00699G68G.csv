4980383,4,B00699G68G,"i heard former wwe wrestler ""diva"" trish stratus was going to be in a film soon. but i had no idea it would be a female dwayne chapman kicking asscott better than pamela anderson barbed wire. part of the reason i cannot in good concience bring myself to buy this. it not trish status. it the fact trish is worlds better looking than brittiny
spears(womanizer)her only one good song(my opinion). and i would get goo-goo brained foot-in-mouth-disease. just trying to watch this. i'll stick to my love of slasher films.

yes i am weak willed, and bounce in between tna and the wwe. trish stratus vs. velvet sky(jaime zsantre,etc).
i am a freak off/on the leash!",1335398400,,658,4.672413793103448
4980384,3,B00699G68G,"This movie is ok, I wouldn't recommend it unless you are a Trish Stratus fan. I loved seeing her kick butt, and also in a school girl outfit at her job as a waitress at a strip club. Alot of the acting is pretty bad as well.",1331424000,,224,3.7872340425531914
4980385,4,B00699G68G,"This is a Canadian version of what I am starting to call a ""white bread grindhouse."" It is a watered down version of the hardcore stuff we are used to seeing such as ""Nude Nuns with Big Guns."" WWF Trish Stratus stars as part of a trio of bounty hunters. She also has the grindhouse occupation of a cocktail waitress at a strip club where she wears a school girl's outfit. (Nice to see they got the e-mail.) She fights in spiked heels and can subdue a man that should be able to snap her in half like a pencil. She is aided by Chase (Boomer Phillips) who seems to take the brunt of the punishment sort of like Jim while Marlin Perkins narrated. Frank J. Zupancic plays the third part of the trio, the ""outside man"" who guards the van and seems to be in charge.

The crew ends up capturing a bounty that the mob wants dead to keep from talking. The conversation went like:

Crime boss: ""I can't wait to meet up with you so I can rip out your f-ing tongue.""
Bounty: ""As long as its not personal.""

The movie has that type of humor. The cat fight scene was a plus...in fact it made me remember I had seen this film before under the title ""Bail Enforcers.""
Good soundtrack. Typical grindhouse bad acting and dialouge. The bonus section has a brief filming of the cat fight.

F-bomb (2 languages), nudity (Misha Highstead) 3 1/2 stars",1331337600,4,1328,4.3

4980387,3,B00699G68G,"Bounty Hunters was a modest start for Trish Stratus. Andrea James Lui is pretty hot too!! BH is an average Action B movie. Trish & Andrea both kick ass in this movie! Trish still looks great <3 & she is a decent actress. Basically, ""Bounty Hunters"" involves 3 Bounty Hunters who have worked together for years and have developed a strong comradery. They catch a low level punk who gives them info on a large scale bail jumper ($1 Million). They agree to let the small fry go & persue the big fish. Chaos and lots of action takes place. The action was okay for the most part, but the boss villain could have been a tad more believable. Bounty Hunters has a runtime of about 1 hr & 15 mins. It could have been 15 to 20 minutes longer, but it was still an average action movie. The design for end credits with the actors pictures was cool. I enjoyed BH for what it is (B Action movie). The end credits has funny outtakes. I recommend Bounty Hunters to fans of action movies and hot chicks like Trish & Andrea!!

Bonus Features: An interview with the lovely <3 Trish Stratus, Behind the scenes of the chick fight, and the movie trailer of Bounty Hunters.",1331337600,5,1150,4.348837209302325
4980388,4,B00699G68G,"Is it a big budget movie? No. Are any of the actors going to give Olivier a run for his money? No. Does Trish Stratus beat the crap out of people in skimpy outfits? YES! If you remember Trish from her WWE days you'll probably recognize a lot of the Diva Of The Decade in her character Jules Taylor. Okay...let's be honest..Trish is really playing an amped up version of her WWE persona in this movie and if you've been missing some Stratusfaction in your life ""Bounty Hunters"" should fit the bill. The fight scene in the ambulance is well worth the price of admission.",1330387200,17,568,4.419047619047619
4980389,2,B00699G68G,"""This guy is a mobster who probebly did 100 things in his life he deserves to die for, why are we sticking up for him?""  Jules (Stratus) is a Bail enforcer who along with her partner are the best in town.  When they go after a dangerous mobster his ""boss"" finds out. He offers the hunters a deal to deliver the prisoner to him instead of the cops for $1,000,000. They must then decide what is the right thing to do.  So...this is in on way a good or even OK movie on the surface. The plot (I use that term loosely) is overused and the acting is almost as bad as reality show acting.  The fight scenes are so bad that even the WWE would say it's fake.  All that said though the writers and the director are banking on the fact that putting Trish Stratus in a little school girl outfit while she fights will keep you watching. I am ashamed to admit that it worked. That is the only reason I kept watching. Overall, a horrible movie that is fun to watch. I give it a C.",1329350400,3,966,4.063157894736842

4980395,5,B00699G68G,"WWE legend and Yoga instructor Trish Stratus stars in this action packed thrill ride that reminds me a lot of Barb Wire starring Pamela Anderson. Jules, played by Stratus, leads her team of specialists on missions but hard times have come. However, now hope springs anew. There is a new $100,000 bounty to deliver an informant to the police before the mob can get to them. The mob offers Jules $1,000,000 to give the informant to them, however. If they do not, you guessed it, the informant and her team will be killed! Now her team must fight to the death with ruthless mob bosses and gangsters galore!

4980411,1,B00699G68G,"I wasted my money on this and am now writing this review so you don't! The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is short. However, even coming in at a shade under 75 minutes I found myself constantly eyeing the time elapsed readout to see how much suffering I had left to endure. Trish Stratus is good in this movie, but it begins and ends there. This really should only be purchased if you're a hardcore fan of Stratus. There is plenty of needless profanity and the fight scenes often look over the top fake - then again, maybe that's what they were going for...",1364774400,,575,4.236363636363636

4980416,5,B00699G68G,"Since the success of Director Steven Soderbergh's 'HAYWIRE'-2011 featuring real life female boxer Gina Carano as a kick ass agent, films of this type are starting to sprout up in the action field like dandelions.  Here we have Director Patrick McBreary's 'BOUNTY HUNTERS' aka 'BAIL ENFORCERS'- 2011, an enjoyable independent Canadian made actioner featuring former WWF wrestler Trish Stratus in the buff babe lead role.  It also features a fine performance by Frank Zupancic who was also in Director Andrew Thomas Hunt's excellent 'SWEET KARMA'-2011 which also featured this films director in its credits.  A plot involving greed and mafiosi revenge, its boasts excellent performances and action sequences including not one but two stand out no holds barred confrontations between Stratus and actress Andrea James Lui which is worth the price of the disc alone and which one does not usually expect when confronted with cheese cake covers as this DVD displays.  MPI Video releases it in a nice 1.85 transfer with great digital sound. With slick production values which makes it look more highly budgeted than it probably was and nice photography with tightly edited sequences,  it is a highly recommended bit of celluloid and Ms. Stratus makes an excellent lethally sexy characterization which stays in the mind long after the last face is kicked out.",1346371200,,1351,5.207373271889401

4980418,4,B00699G68G,"What you get with Bounty Hunters (Originally titled Bail Enforcers) is a 70 minute modest budget action movie with some fun fight scenes, some provocative dialogue and of course Trish Stratus being the gorgeous butt kicker she was in the WWE. Its a good for a rental if you're looking for something fun to watch on a Friday night, but if you're looking to buy it, I'd recommend waiting for the price to drop a bit first.",1341532800,,420,4.467532467532467

Nothing really unique here after the premise, until the bathroom fight scene.  That completely won me over for the stupidity and fun! Nice use of stereotypes.  Not for kids.  Low budget, but fun.

Lots of slow, posturing, if you like that sort of thing.

the women has a young daughter and she is working both jobs to
raise her daughter and by being a bounty hunter, she could possibly  do 2 things at once
find a future father for her daughter and make enough money so she can quit danicing
 the other guy, he wants to be a police officer, but  ,he has some medical issues
