8387304,3,B0031XYLVC,"I rate it 2 1/2 stars...very average.
The film quality is low...poor contrast and grainy streaks...not restored in the least.
There are a few times when you are to read clippings or script (No dialogue cards) and it is difficult or impossible to read them...maybe a larger screen might help, but I doubt it. and one of the clippings shown twice appeared to be somewhat important to the story. By the quality of the production I would have guessed the movie was made in 1913-1915...not 1923. The music was random...so occasionaly it fit the scenes and more often didn't.and it often just abrubptly switches tracks... Random Classical or spudo classical themes played with a few semi westerny themes played. some fit, most didn't.
The movie was pretty ...I guess melodramatic would be the term. The editing...average... You could follow it most of the time but occasionaly you wondered 'how did he figure that out' or what's going on here, so you had to catch up a bit...but it's wasn't really a factor. The story was OK and there were the odd novel ideas, but they were few. It wasn't terrible, but not great either.",1370908800,,1115,4.752577319587629
