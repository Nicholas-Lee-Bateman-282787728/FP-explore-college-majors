3069270,5,B0011VB85S,"This is a film that Martin Scorcese cited as a prime example of an exciting and realistic family drama produced on a small budget. Steve Cochran, who originally owned the film rights, plays an alcoholic drifter who deserted his family in Arkansas in the 1920s. Ann Sheridan, in one of her last and finest roles portrays the wife who keeps things going while raising 2 children o her own. the husband returns hoping to make amends. But will his family or community welcome him back? Its a down to earth drama of hard living in hard times. If you watch this film, you'll want things to work out--it's moving and honest and Cochran and Sheridan are outstanding in their roles with fine support from Walter Brennan, Sonny Tufts and Sherry Jackson as the mute daughter. See it--you'll love it.",1240790400,12,788,4.676258992805756

3069273,5,B0011VB85S,"Appeared on most lists as one of the best films of the year.  The film is an American pastorale emphasizing the landscape, the natural cycle of life and death, and the animals and people who live in the country (Arkansas,1927).  Steve Cochran, Ann Sheridan, Walter Brennan, Richard Eyer,  Sherry Jackson, and Edgar Buchanan play archetypes, the kinds of people who appear in stories about human beings who struggle to live with dignity and to be kind to other people in the place in which they live.  Each actor knows how to listen and the relationships among them are communicated mainly through glances and silence as opposed to dialogue.  The theme of this Republic film  is primarily concerned with finding a voice and a place in time.  If a person learns to wait and to look forward to next spring, the pains of life are bearable and a kind of resurrection occurs.  This is Steve Cochran's best film and one of Ann Sheridan's best as a mature actress.  The music is carefully integrated into the story by Max Steiner and a young Tony Bennett sings the theme song at the start of the film.",1463443200,3,1093,4.6217616580310885

Ann Sheridan and Steve Cochran were very good, as was the young actress that played the mute daughter.  The beauty of the movie is that it had no sex or profanity in it anywhere.

3069299,4,B0011VB85S,"A pleasant, interesting movie.  An improvement over most of what Amazon has to offer.  The acting and most of the script are better than average for a film of its period.  What really impressed though me was the focus on detail.  From the wardrobe selections to the interior sets, the filmmakers fairly accurately captured the time being depicted.  I have seen women wearing similar hand sewn cotton dresses, I have been in houses with wood plank ceilings, and anyone who grew up before air conditioning and who spent any time near a farm will instantly recognize the gesture when one character sits down at the supper table to eat and reaches out to shoo away a fly  The main actors, though glamorous stars, did not simply smear a little soot on their faces to feign being poor country folk.  Rather they found a way to capture the hard edged countenance of people used to struggling with the difficulties of everyday life on a farm, while exhibiting the inner glow of those who know they have much for which to be thankful.  In other words, they came about as close to depicting real people in the rural south I have ever seen from anyone in Hollywood.

With all these words of praise, why only four stars?  Because this movie was filmed in the mid nineteen fifties, at a time when Hollywood was still having a hard time figuring our how to end a picture.  I don't know if they went long in filming, or were over budget, or if the studio president simply demanded that his nephew be allowed to direct some scenes, but for some reason this picture suddenly realized it was a Hollywood movie and began to fall apart toward the end.  (I thought about making a joke about the ending being a real scream, but I don't want my review to get any bad reviews.)  Actually you will likely figure out the way it ends when you hear the explanation as to why a certain plot of land was fenced off.  I guessed it, though at the time I was hoping against hope the film didn't have such a trite conclusion.  Still, even with the usual studio formula ending, Come Next Spring does offer an hour and half of positive entertainment, and could almost be considered semi-educational in its depiction of life in the rural south in the early to mid 1900's.",1437696000,,2234,4.4950495049504955

Steve Cochran had the best role of his career in this movie.  Always the bad guy, the gangster, or devious con man.  But here, in this low budget film, he did an outstanding job as the redeemed father returning home to his family.  He is supported by a great cast...Walter Brennan, Edgar Buchanan,  Ann Sheridan, Sherry Jackson, Richard Eyre, and a slew of good character actors!  It is not a well-known film, but it is a very good one, and one you would not mind watching again!  Don't know why I remembered the line, ""Matt, who screamed"" for so many years, but I did.

3069347,5,B0011VB85S,"This is one of my favorite movies....growing up in the Arkansas and Missouri Ozarks, this story, taking place there, captures the culture and area well (though it wasn't filmed there). And what a feel good story it is! A family reunited after a decade apart, the trials they encounter, and the colorful characters that surround them make for a great movie experience....clean, with no vulgarity, or profanity, families can watch and enjoy together. And of course, Walter Brennan always adds so much to a story....

  My only problem with this disc is the quality of the transfer. It looks like this copy was transferred from a wobbly VHS copy. That's still acceptable to me...I wanted this movie so much and to find it on Amazon and to receive it in 3 days makes up for picture quality.",1410393600,,786,4.7226277372262775

Just a nice film about a farm family with Ann Sheridan as the mother.  Steve Cochran (who I knew as playing bad guys) does a good job as the father \ husband who must make amends to his family.

Guilt and shame sends him running away from home, to wander for several years.  The return home is not easy.  Community memories are still haunting all who love the family.

The story of this young man's return to his family struck a chord with me.  Many veterans of war violence have trouble dealing with the transition to home life again.  This problem persists today, even though the wars are somewhat different.  The story of the way  this man overcame criticism and regained his position as a responsible family man is as relevant today as it was when this movie was made.

3069381,5,B0011VB85S,"Actor-producer Steve Cochran and his friend writer, Montgomery Pittman had a dream--to make a realistic, and moving family film. Pittman based his story on a true Arkansas tale of a man who wanted to redeem himself to the family he had deserted years before. He wrote the story for his step daughter Sherry Jackson and Cochran as the father and mute daughter. Ann Sheridan played the mother, in one of her last films. Martin Scorcese probably summed it up best as a prime example of how an effective family drama could be made on a small budget. It also gave Steve Cochran, one of Hollywood's most unappreciated actors, an oppotunity to break away from the mobster type roles that he was typecast in. His portrayal of Matt, the father and alcoholic deserter, who redeems himself, is right on target, and should bring a few tears to the eyes of even the most cynical viewers. As a Cochran fan, I strongly reccommend this film, which led to another of his greatest performances a year later in Michaelangelo Anronioni""s ""Il Grido""",1289606400,15,1028,4.748603351955308

3303767,5,B0011VB85S,"This is a film that Martin Scorcese cited as a prime example of an exciting and realistic family drama produced on a small budget. Steve Cochran, who originally owned the film rights, plays an alcoholic drifter who deserted his family in Arkansas in the 1920s. Ann Sheridan, in one of her last and finest roles portrays the wife who keeps things going while raising 2 children o her own. the husband returns hoping to make amends. But will his family or community welcome him back? Its a down to earth drama of hard living in hard times. If you watch this film, you'll want things to work out--it's moving and honest and Cochran and Sheridan are outstanding in their roles with fine support from Walter Brennan, Sonny Tufts and Sherry Jackson as the mute daughter.

3303770,5,B0011VB85S,"Appeared on most lists as one of the best films of the year.  The film is an American pastorale emphasizing the landscape, the natural cycle of life and death, and the animals and people who live in the country (Arkansas,1927).  Steve Cochran, Ann Sheridan, Walter Brennan, Richard Eyer,  Sherry Jackson, and Edgar Buchanan play archetypes, the kinds of people who appear in stories about human beings who struggle to live with dignity and to be kind to other people in the place in which they live.  Each actor knows how to listen and the relationships among them are communicated mainly through glances and silence as opposed to dialogue.  The theme of this Republic film  is primarily concerned with finding a voice and a place in time.  If a person learns to wait and to look forward to next spring, the pains of life are bearable and a kind of resurrection occurs.  This is Steve Cochran's best film and one of Ann Sheridan's best as a mature actress.  The music is carefully integrated into the story by Max Steiner and a young Tony Bennett sings the theme song at the start of the film.",1463443200,3,1093,4.6217616580310885

3303796,4,B0011VB85S,"A pleasant, interesting movie.  An improvement over most of what Amazon has to offer.  The acting and most of the script are better than average for a film of its period.  What really impressed though me was the focus on detail.  From the wardrobe selections to the interior sets, the filmmakers fairly accurately captured the time being depicted.  I have seen women wearing similar hand sewn cotton dresses, I have been in houses with wood plank ceilings, and anyone who grew up before air conditioning and who spent any time near a farm will instantly recognize the gesture when one character sits down at the supper table to eat and reaches out to shoo away a fly  The main actors, though glamorous stars, did not simply smear a little soot on their faces to feign being poor country folk.  Rather they found a way to capture the hard edged countenance of people used to struggling with the difficulties of everyday life on a farm, while exhibiting the inner glow of those who know they have much for which to be thankful.  In other words, they came about as close to depicting real people in the rural south I have ever seen from anyone in Hollywood.

With all these words of praise, why only four stars?  Because this movie was filmed in the mid nineteen fifties, at a time when Hollywood was still having a hard time figuring our how to end a picture.  I don't know if they went long in filming, or were over budget, or if the studio president simply demanded that his nephew be allowed to direct some scenes, but for some reason this picture suddenly realized it was a Hollywood movie and began to fall apart toward the end.  (I thought about making a joke about the ending being a real scream, but I don't want my review to get any bad reviews.)  Actually you will likely figure out the way it ends when you hear the explanation as to why a certain plot of land was fenced off.  I guessed it, though at the time I was hoping against hope the film didn't have such a trite conclusion.  Still, even with the usual studio formula ending, Come Next Spring does offer an hour and half of positive entertainment, and could almost be considered semi-educational in its depiction of life in the rural south in the early to mid 1900's.",1437696000,,2234,4.4950495049504955

Pittman based his story on a true Arkansas tale of a man who wanted to redeem himself to the family he had deserted years before. He wrote the story for his step daughter Sherry Jackson and Cochran as the father and mute daughter. Ann Sheridan played the mother, in one of her last films. Martin Scorcese probably summed it up best as a prime example of how an effective family drama could be made on a small budget. It also gave Steve Cochran, one of Hollywood's most unappreciated actors, an oppotunity to break away from the mobster type roles that he was typecast in. His portrayal of Matt, the father and alcoholic deserter, who redeems himself, is right on target, and should bring a few tears to the eyes of even the most cynical viewers.

The quality of the film was not as good as I hoped, BUT, it is indeed an old movie and I accept the video as I received it.  It is better than just having the memories.  I am quite satisfied.",1248825600,,285,3.716666666666667

8242562,5,B0011VB85S,"Ann Sheridan was a great star through the 1940's.  The ''oomph girl for the soldiers in ww2''.  If a viewer looks at her before she speaks, one is magically in a fantasy.  Then Sheridan speaks and it is like hot water in the face.  The sound of her voice does not match the seductress.  Sheridan shows us.  Her voice is gravely, scraping along a rusty barrel, or just the first grating sounds of morning after a sweet goodnight.

I find her aging, and how the camera and the studio dealt with it fascinating.  1949 starred her in the Howard Hawks directed; ''I was a male Bone structure as sharp as the lines of the ''Empire state Building''.  The audience enjoyed her presence in so many films.war Bride''.  A huge hit.  Sheridan and Cary Grant are perfect for this film that makes no sense.  The two ramble and tic/toc at each other and seldom does anything here meet.  But Sheridan is so good in the masculine sort of wac uniform, and always sounding as if she was reciting as well as explaining the telephone book, and why we should have one.  Cary Grant is also pig-headed, but as he is supposed to seduce and doesn't, Or, not quite.  20th century made war bride, and gave Sheridan a club key to better pictures at 20thFox.  Well they didn't keep their promise.  I have the 1950 film that Sheridan did. ''Stella''. with Victor Mature.  A Sheridan fan could see it in ''war bride''.  Her face looks full and haggard, specially under the chin.

''Come next Spring'' 1956 brings us to almost the end of Sheridan's career.  In this film all softness and humor and fun are gone from Sheridan.  The camera was not kind here, Oh!!! accept when Sheridan is taking a bath in a galvanized tub.  The camera surprises Sheridan, and for perhaps the final time, shows the viewer what all the fuss was about.  Sheridan looks young and lovely and for once, with the red hair.  Hot.  A year later she made her last film.  A supporting role, but the voice cutting through the other actresses.  Dressed to the 1957 nines.

Almost ten years later she was in a daily soap opera.  She looked like she had been delivered in the mummy case in the 1941, ''The man who came to Dinner''. and been left in the desert to dry out all those years.  The voice was intact!! and one didn't want to look, but when she spoke, one couldn't look away.  Very soon the network got wise, She had a face lift and she looked almost as she once did.  ''Pistols and Petticoats''.  But  as soon as the first episode was shown, the network announced that Sheridan had cancer and that she would miss some episodes.  And then she was gone.  The cancer had been working at her for a long time.  Long before the t.v. comeback and the facelift ''to die for'', but Ann was a brave and funny gal.  Just look at her movies, her work.",1471910400,,2783,4.403543307086614

8242564,5,B0011VB85S,"On practically all levels this is a movie about conversion, transformation, faith, doubt, resurrection, disbelief and ultimately belief.  The author and script writers knowingly or unknowingly followed the outline of the Christian experience although it really is not a film about religion at all.  The movie makes for great family-time watching and/or having church-based discussions afterwards.  With that said, it is also a wonderful early 1900s recreation period piece of rural life in America.  Enjoy!",1470441600,,506,5.706666666666667
