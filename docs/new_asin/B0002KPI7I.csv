I didn't care for the plot either. I thought this movie was stupid. I recommend that you see When Fortune Smiles,Fight Back To School 1-3 and King Of Beggars instead.",1304553600,,322,4.47457627118644

of its type.
If you are a Stephen Chow fan,
you will not be disappointed.
Andy Lau fans may rejoice also,
although it is not his typical martial
arts action type role.

There is plenty of slapstick comedy
and a good plot.

The ""Knight Of Gamblers"" (Lau),
a disciple of the ""God of Gamblers"",
receives a challenge from both
an impostor and the self-proclaimed
""Saint Of Gamblers"", a wannabe disciple
of the ""God Of Gamblers"", who is in
a partnership with his ambitious uncle.
The real ""Knight"" and the ""Saint""
eventually from a friendship and
team up to defeat the impostor.

Things are complicated by the rule
imposed on the ""Knight"" by the ""God""
that nearly all of his winnings must
go to charity and the circumstance that
the mystical powers used by the ""Saint""
to succeed at gambling are lost
if he spends any of the money that
he wins at gambling.

This movie is the combined sequel
of two separate movies,
but that in no way prevents its
enjoyment in itself.
You needn't have seen
the antecedent movies to enjoy
this one fully.

As per usual for these Chinese language
movies that did not receive a proper
release in the English speaking world,
the English language subtitles are
bad to horrible.
Much of the meaning and subtlety
of meaning in the dialog are lost.
The subtitles are so bad,
that in a weird way,
they become part of the comedy.

I highly recommend this comedy,
particularly as good comedy is hard
to come by.
The plunger nunchucks are not to be
missed.

Enjoy!",1291766400,,1509,4.546125461254612
