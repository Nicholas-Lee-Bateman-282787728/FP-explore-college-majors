4046472,5,B0030IUQ7Q,"I really liked this movie.  It is not going to smash any box office records, but this movie is really well written and entertaining. I thought Lutz was great as the Guiness Man.  He is one of my favorite characters on 30 Rock, so I was suprised to see him in this movie.

Enjoy",1285027200,,277,4.092592592592593
4046473,5,B0030IUQ7Q,"Wow, this movie is definitely one of the funniest I have seen in a while!  The amusement park setting is perfect for this quirky comedy, a fun backdrop for the wild storyline.  Thomas Middleditch, a newcomer to the scene, really shines in this plot as an unmotivated town native who falls for a cool, geocaching splinterhead (NOT A CARNIE, there is a difference people!) named Galaxy.  The relationship that develops between the two, though odd and seemingly unlikely, is well formed.  I was happy to see Christopher McDonald and Lea Thompson featured in the ensemble of characters, and though their parts are small, they definitely add a special comedic spark.  From The Amazing Steve and his trusty sidekick Wyoming to the lazy Wayne Chung, Splinterheads will leave you feeling entertained and satisfied!",1280361600,,806,5.075757575757576
4046474,5,B0030IUQ7Q,"Simply put, Splinterheads is HILARIOUS!  The ensemble cast of quirky characters allows you to escape into the bizarre subculture of the traveling carnival world.  Just Frost, the twenty something slacker, falls hard for the uber-sexy Galaxy played by Rachael Taylor.  Galaxy is passing through town with the carnival and going on Geocaching excursions on her free time.  If you haven't heard about Geocaching yet.  You need to check it out!  [...] (You can thank me later)  Also, the truly awesome Christopher McDonald a.ka. Shooter McGavin from Happy Gilmore, plays Sergeant Bruce Mancuso, a laugh out loud hilarious police officer, who is desperately in love with Justin Frost's mom, who is played by Lea Thompson from Back to the Future!  Leah freakin' Thompson!  Oh, and there's these two low-rent magicians at the carnival named The Amazing Steve and Wyoming...THEY ARE SO FUNNY!!!...that they're worth the price of admission, so to speak, on their own!  If you like yourself, you owe it to yourself to see Splinterheads!",1280188800,,1026,5.163636363636364
4046475,5,B0030IUQ7Q,"Splinterheads is a comedy about Justin Frost (Middleditch), a slacker without any direction whose life is about to actually get interesting when the carnival rolls into town and he falls for Galaxy (Taylor), a beautiful scammer who is looking to break loose of the carnie life.
I went into this just expecting to enjoy watching Chris McDonald play yet another frenetic character but what a joy to find this motley crew of a cast! The Amazing Steve (Mantzoukas) and Wyoming's (Parham) magic duo is hilarious! I do believe that the Amazing Steve and Wyoming should go on the road and tour. Or at least do a show on my rooftop! Thomas Middleditch is fantastically awkward as is Lea Thompson playing his hapless mother. Pamela Shaw and Frankie Faison hooking up is delightfully disturbing and Jason Rogel and Edmund Lyndeck bring it all together. Rachel Taylor is great and brings so much more to the table than just being the ""hot chick.""
Make sure you check out ""The Amazing Steve"" shorts under the special features! Hilarious!
Definitely pick up a copy!",1276560000,,1052,4.85
4046476,4,B0030IUQ7Q,"I watched the movie and enjoyed it. It was a good romantic teen comedy. I especially liked and laughed at the ""oldest man in the world"" in the movie. Edmund Lyndeck was very funny. I loved him in ""Big Daddy"" and in ""Road Trip."" He made the movie. Teens will like the movie!",1271721600,,273,4.169811320754717
4046477,1,B0030IUQ7Q,"The language got a little old for me on this one and I had been hoping to show it to my son to get him jazzed about Geocaching. Fortunately, husband and I watched it ahead of time to see if it was appropriate and we found out within the first five minutes that we'd not be viewing this one as a family.
 I wouldn't let anyone under sixteen watch this one and I doubt many over sixteen will want to. God love 'em. It has it's moments but ~yawn~",1267747200,3,443,3.9775280898876404
4046478,2,B0030IUQ7Q,"This could have been a good movie, but profanity simply for the sake of profanity took a lot away from it. Also, most people outgrow the penis jokes at age 14. The writer for this movie evidently hasn't. At least now I know the difference between a ""carny"" and a ""splinterhead!""",1267660800,3,278,4.470588235294118
4046479,5,B0030IUQ7Q,"I saw this film when it played in NY back in November and it was a lot of fun. Made me remember when the traveling carnival came around when I was a kid. Ahh, the memories. Fun cast with that guy from Happy Gilmore and the reason guys wear Calvins, Lea Thompson (Back to the Future). Dean Winters plays his usual bada$$ self and the old guy is hilarious! The guy who plays Justin (lead character) really grows on you and has good comedic timing. And watching Rachael Taylor for 1.5 hours is well worth the price! ;)",1266019200,3,515,4.26530612244898
4046480,4,B0030IUQ7Q,"I was not a huge fan of the other amusement park/carnival film made last year, and even though this was one had a much lower budget, it comes across as more believable.

The story follows some small-town lifers as their paths cross with a traveling carnival crew in life changing ways. The premise mixes a small bit of romantic comedy with white-trash drama, but through the course of humorous and sobering events, the lives of our two unlikely leads become intertwined - possibly for the long term. In comparison to Adventureland, this ending is much more palatable and believable.

The picture quality is actually solid throughout, including the various night and indoor sequences. The sound is an average 5.1, with a couple challenges. The special features center on the character I cared about the least (the Amazing Steve magician guy) as it shows a couple shorts; one of him practicing holding his breath for the movie stunt, and one of him changing his name - legally. Both skippers. The Gag Reel lasts a few more minutes and has some funny outtakes. There are optional Spanish subtitles for the film.

Some fun performances from known actors (Dean Winters, Chris Macdonald, Lea Thompson and the Transformers gal Rachel Taylor) and a few unrecognized newcomers (Middleditch, Rogel). Some nice filming locations in rural New York coupled with a decent script and crisp picture make for a recommendable watch. As a side note, one of the film's central themes is geocaching, so if you enjoy that past time - you will dig this film. Enjoy.",1266019200,3,1542,4.900383141762452
4046481,5,B0030IUQ7Q,"The characters alone make this a ""must see film"". The photography is amazing for such a low cost indie film. It never got the theater-play it deserved. The NY TIMES and EW liked it but nobody saw it. I think it is 2009's "" Little Miss Sunshine "". It was filmed on Long Island and deserves to be seen. And, that ""extra"" with the grey shirt in the crowd acting bored while watching the horrible carnival magacian is worthy of an ""oscar nomination"" all by himself. He's got to do more film work. GET THIS FILM - it is destined to be a ""cult classic"" By the way, I'm that extra.",1261872000,2,574,4.18018018018018

4046483,4,B0030IUQ7Q,"I originally heard of this because of the geocaching. Yes, there are a couple things that aren't quite accurate, but it's very close and certainly gets at the heart of geocaching.

This romantic comedy is worth watching as just that. The acting is very good and draws us into their world. It's nice to have a feel-good movie that's not too mushy.",1391990400,,346,4.580645161290323
4046484,4,B0030IUQ7Q,"While this movie is nothing original for the most part, it is however very funny for what it is. I found this on Netflix and immediately put in my order.",1383782400,,153,4.133333333333334
4046485,5,B0030IUQ7Q,The Wife and I love this movie.  It didn't good ratings but we like it.  We first heard of it because of it's reference to GeoCaching.  We first rented it from the library then we bought it because of the price.  Silly but entertaining.,1368144000,2,236,4.295454545454546
4046486,5,B0030IUQ7Q,This was a bargain price for this video.  I gave it to my friends as a gift for xmas.  They absolutely loved it.,1364083200,,112,3.8260869565217392
4046487,3,B0030IUQ7Q,"This is an Indy flick that is too self conscious. It's trying to be wow and now but it all seems too obvious.

Here's the scoop. Justin is a nice guy in up-state New York. He's kind of a schlub. He has no particular talents or aspirations. He works for a buddy who owns a lawn care service, but he's pretty much confined to mowing duties. His dad's dead. He lives with his mom and is afraid to lose her to a local cop who has eyes on her. He gets smitten with Galaxy who is working with a carnival that is passing through. They sort of hook up and various adventures ensue.

This is a very uneven film. Some of the performances (Rachel Taylor, Dean Winters and Chris McDonald) are decently written and acted. Others (Tom Middleditch and Lea Thompson) just aren't happening. Justin (Middleditch) goes through no transformation. Though he has one shining moment (through a fluke) he's the same aimless dweeb at the end as he is in the beginning. Why should Galaxy want to be with him? Some of the plot developments didn't allow me to suspend my disbelief. The grandpa was unbelievable. Pamela Shaw, as the aunt, was a cardboard cutout. It just seemed to miss the mark at most every turn.

This was decently shot and edited. The music was okay. But in the end, I couldn't do much more than shrug my shoulders. Had I not seen it, I couldn't say I'd missed anything important. This isn't a bad watch. It just isn't very good.",1342051200,,1420,4.412213740458015
4046488,2,B0030IUQ7Q,"I'm having difficulties putting my finger on just what exactly about this movie I despise...
Lets see, could it be that the male lead has the mannerisms of a neurotic Napoleon Dynamite?
Or maybe how the ""Oh so hot!"" female lead is so ""EDGY"" and has a cool name like Galaxy,
and awesome fake tattoos which she feels the need to show off by rolling up her sleeve?
I'm pretty sure everyone in this production was so enamored with this girl, they forgot
she was way to clean to be a geocacher or a Carnie...oh wait she's not a carnie, she's a
Splinter head...way edgier, a hustler, a scam artist...a thief...hmm...

But i digress,
Maybe, it was that for a movie clearly made to entertain college kids, the only likeable
characters were the adults? WAIT! I think we may have hit on something here...
Could it be that it's because all the young people in this film save for the male lead
and his admittedly funny best friend ""MMM...this sandwhiches are sooo tasty!"" all are
insufferable ******bags whom can only communicate with each other through thick sarcasm
and insulting quips?
For example, at a certain point in the film the male lead is called to do something
he has clearly never done before and is understandably apprehensive. A nearby pair of
""oh so edgy"" girls, never having met him or seen him before, feel the need to spout
emasculating insults at him. Completely oblivious that they are in optimal position to
have their heads soccer kicked into broken necks...

I've also noticed that other low score reviews complaining about the lame profanity
have been down voted...hmm I wonder by who? EDGY fans of this movie maybe?

so why 2 stars? well there are a few physical gags that actually work.
Or you could always watch the movie for The Amazing steve, whom amazingly is well...
actually pretty amazing.",1335312000,,1811,4.688679245283019
4046489,5,B0030IUQ7Q,"This is a super cute movie with hilarious characters (Thomas Middleditch is so awesome.)  You root for the good guys and hate the bad guys, and it's hilarious all the way.  Watch this movie!!",1322611200,,191,4.588235294117647
4046490,4,B0030IUQ7Q,"Sort of a cross between ""Adventureland"" and ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" ""Splinterheads"" is a tremendously appealing indie comedy about a spastic, perennially put-upon doofus named Justin (Thomas Middleditch) who falls victim to some unscrupulous carnies who come to town.  One of them is a beautiful young con artist who goes by the stage name Galaxy (played by the radiant Rachael Taylor), who has a domineering boyfriend (the wonderful Dean Winters from ""Rescue Me""), and who sees qualities in Justin that others, including the lad himself, cannot.  (A ""splinterhead,"" apparently, is a worker at a carnival who specializes in roping in easily spotted suckers from the crowd).

Middleditch hits all the right notes in making the bumbling, stuttering, well-meaning Justin a wholly likable and wholly relatable figure.  Ditto for the rest of the cast, which includes Jason Rogel as his even dorkier best buddy, Wayne; Christopher McDonald as the town's petty and overzealous sheriff; Edmund Lyndeck as Justin's 116-year-old great-grandfather; Lea Thompson as his mom; and Jason Mantzaukas and Lennon Parham as a third-rate magician and his devoted assistant.

Writer/director Brant Sersen nicely captures the flavor of the rural, small town environment in which the film's set, and while he may make amusing caricatures out of his characters, he never feels the need to dehumanize or talk down to them - or to us, for that matter.  The humor always remains sharp and observant, and the movie provides some pretty solid laughs throughout.

Check it out.",1295136000,3,1544,5.329218106995885
4046491,4,B0030IUQ7Q,This was such a hilarious and light hearted movie. I don't think my husband and i spent more than a few minutes not laughing at this delightfully funny comedy. The actors were perfect and believable and the setting made it even funnier. Loved the geocaching parts as well it tied everything together nicely and taught me a little about something i didn't even know existed. This will have you laughing til the end. You may even be like my husband and use some of the funny lines and try to do some of the funny stunts that they did as well. Although this isn't recommended. :),1290556800,,576,4.443396226415095
