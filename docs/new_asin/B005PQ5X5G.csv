It's sexy, sassy, classy, Wahala! I finished watching season 1 and am working on getting all of season two so I can watch it. Too bad American TV cannot produce shows such as Adam's Apples.",1474156800,,361,4.098591549295775

8482584,5,B005PQ5X5G,"I just happened upon this series recently. Apart from being compared to Soul Food: The Series, this is an amazing story about three sisters, their mom and the discovery of a brother and niece. Every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting a change from the day to day soap opera of reality shows on TV. Now this is clearly something that should be on the TV in the U.S. (at least The Africa Channel, if not TVOne or BET). The cast is great, the production is awesome and the plot is captivating.  Season 1 is free so check it out on[...] but after watching season 1, you'll realize that season 2 is worth the money over on [...]. Also check out Peep over on ReelAfrican as well.  You won't be disappointed and good luck.",1403136000,,766,4.3125
8482585,5,B005PQ5X5G,"For w Ghanian movie, this movie was awesome!! It totally put the bar up for the future!!! I'm totally addicted to the movie. For it not to have ANY violence or unnecessary nudity (like current African films are pushing) this movie was tastefully & thoroughly thought through!!! Great acting & each cast was matched very we'll with each other. Go Ghana!",1386633600,,352,4.786885245901639
8482586,5,B005PQ5X5G,"This series is wonderful. Great cast, with the excepion of a couple of characters, but overall-this is one I've added to my DVD collection. I sure hope they come back with Season 2! Pay special attention on chapter 6 to vocalist Irene Logan's beautiful ""My Mind Dey"" that she sings in the club scene-excellent!",1368316800,,310,4.7592592592592595
8482587,5,B005PQ5X5G,"Oh .... how intriguing these movies are.. so nice to see Ghanian film coming along as such. I am thrilled with this series and look forward to all the episodes and them being available on Amazon... It's such a nice luxury for those of us that are abroad and want access to great African film... KUDOS, for a job well done!",1347494400,,322,4.295081967213115
8482588,5,B005PQ5X5G,I want to watch all 10 chapters now. Can't wait for them all to be sold on Amazon. I can't bear to buy boot leg copies anymore.,1323734400,,127,3.740740740740741
8482589,5,B005PQ5X5G,"Shirley Frimpong-Manso and Ken Attoh are the perfect combo to grace Ghana movie industry, awesome. Chris Attoh also directing, did I say awesome? Lol, wish Chris Attoh was part of the cast though, love seeing him.
Perfect cast, directing, acting (except for Fo, he is kinda fake), costume e.t.c just great. Love Shirley Frimpong_Manso and look forward to more productions from her company Sparrows.
Great job guys",1320019200,2,413,5.17910447761194
