1183357,5,B0000048GG,"I truly love the Canton Spirituals.  The DVD is INSPIRATIONAL and ANOINTED.  I was raised up with the Canton Spirituals, and they are truly a group that sings the praises of God from the heart.  The late Harvey ""Pop"" Watkins sings until your soul is uplifted.  When Harvey Watkins Jr., sings ""Fix It Jesus"", whatever problem you are going through you will have assurance that it will be fixed.  All gospel quartets and gospel music lovers this is the DVD YOU MUST HAVE!!  Buy it and cherish it, and make it a part of your gospel music collection for years to come.",1424822400,,564,4.480392156862745

With Pop being gone, I feel like I am able to keep his memory alive.  The fire that he had will never go out and his spirit will and continue to live on in my heart.  The Canton Spirituals will continue to be one of my favorite groups of all time.  As a true Canton Spirituals fan, this DVD will make you feel like ""Jeremiah"".  It will get you up and moving around.  I couldn't help but feel it in my hands and feet.  Purchase this, and you too will ""Rise Above it All"".  Therefore, I give it all the stars in Heaven!!!",1402617600,,641,3.8692307692307693
