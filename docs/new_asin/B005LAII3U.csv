4744031,1,B005LAII3U,"The original ""Total Recall"" still holds up despite being made back in 1990. The special effects are a little awkward at times, but overall it fits the overall tone of the film. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but isn't completely over the top which is perhaps why it still stands up today. Getting your ass to Mars, pulling tracking beacons out of your head through your nose, being hit in the crotch over and over again, and talking to a puppet attached to a guy's stomach only added to its early 90s goodness. So the people behind the remake decided to strip all of that away and throw in a bunch of ridiculous eye candy. It just doesn't feel the same.

""Total Recall"" is now based entirely on Earth and we never even go to Mars. The movie makes it a point to bring up visiting Mars as a Rekall option and it only seems to rub salt in the wound. Colin Farrell is now Douglas Quaid/Hauser, Kate Beckinsale is Lori, Jessica Biel is Melina, and Bryan Cranston is Cohaagen. The action movie is so redundant though. Every fight scene seems to feature Kate Beckinsale sliding on her knees and/or running on the wall/ceiling and Colin Farrell taking cover behind something before jumping (usually in slow motion) to another platform.

There was some hope that Bryan Cranston would at least make some part of this worthwhile since he's so extraordinary on ""Breaking Bad,"" but he's only around during the final act and his performance is mostly forgotten thanks to you being mesmerized by his Donald Trump hairstyle. Usually you can appreciate homage in film and be absorbed in the adventure currently being presented to you. With ""Total Recall,"" it's like it's trying so hard to be ""Star Trek,"" then switches gears and jumps to ""I, Robot,"" then ""Minority Report,"" then ""Blade Runner,"" then ""The Fifth Element,"" and the list just keeps piling up. Wearing your influences on your sleeve is one thing, but ""Total Recall"" seems to have too many ingredients in its watered down recipe.

While the three breasted prostitute does appear with unclothed breasts (yes, all three of them), it isn't enough to save what is otherwise just a mess of a movie. There is so much unnecessary content thrown in just because it looks cool like the glowing neon tattoos or the gravity switching transportation that has a really lame payoff. When Hauser first meets Matthias (Bill Nighy), Nighy is talking like Hugo Weaving did as Agent Smith in ""The Matrix"" films. It probably doesn't help that he greeted Hauser by saying, ""Mister Hauser,"" and their conversation that followed felt awfully similar to Neo's conversation with The Architect in ""The Matrix Reloaded.""

There was that ""South Park"" episode where they say the word ""s**t"" 162 times in the span of a half hour (episode title ""It Hits the Fan""). ""Total Recall"" rivals that as that word is said so much that it begins to lose its meaning. The original had a countless number of crotch shots and the remake is full of s**t.

The final product is this really big, juicy piece of flashy, streamlined, anticlimactic, tiresome, candy coated garbage that is just boring. It's as if the movie borrows from not only the original ""Total Recall,"" but several beloved sci-fi films and it never really is able to establish its own entity. Every action sequence is nearly identical to the last while the excessive blockbuster is overflowing with unnecessary content. Kate Beckinsale and her donkey faced acting are around for entirely too long and Jessica Biel is utterly useless. ""Total Recall"" is like shoving streamers and sparklers in a huge pile of crap and trying to pass it off as a party; no matter what you do to it it's still crap.

The Blu-ray for the Mind-Bending Edition of the original ""Total Recall"" is around $10-$12. Buy that, stay home, and be happy or go to the theater, see this, and shove your parking valet's face through the windshield of someone's brand new car because you're so enraged that nobody even had the desire to ""start the reactor.""",1343952000,61,3992,4.753246753246753
4744032,5,B005LAII3U,"This remake returns to the Big Screen, starring Colin Farrell, and this compelling fight for defeat aims to please! PG-13. Cast is Superb and Special Effects Stunning. Douglas is a factory worker with a stable job and loving wife. A company offers him the memory of the ultimate espionage adventure and because he's desperate for a vacation, he decides a virtual vacation is better than no vacation as he agrees. As the memories are being implanted, the system goes haywire, then breaks down. The drama begins as Douglas runs to unite with a rebel soldier as the war begins. Douglas is on the hunt for a power-crazed leader, who wants to control the entire free world. A thrilling battle becomes explosive.

4744254,5,B005LAII3U,I avoided seeing this 2012 remake but finally watched it on a long weekend. It is not the crazy spectacular of 1990 with Arnold Schwarzenegger but has enough juice to stand on it's own. I like the two female action co-stars/ Kate Bekinsale and Jessica Biel /that add a sexier element than the original TR had. The newish story line holds up and Colin Farrel holds his own. Lots of action and some dark humor. Jessica Biel is made to look somewhat Asian or American Indian which adds to it all.,1519516800,,493,4.428571428571429

I have mixed feelings about this film, on the one hand Colin Farrell is a better actor than Arnold was in the original but the direction by Len Wiseman lacked the irony and wit of Paul Verhoeven but the visual effects were fantastic and well shot yet the film is somewhat over long---like almost 2 hours or more.  The ladies of course are a treat to watch since we have Kate Beckingsale , always great in tights or underwear and the lovely Jessica Biel.

I fell asleep within the first hour, and awoke to give it a second chance. With over 30 minutes left on the second go-around, I just turned it off. I wasted enough time with this going-nowhere, lackadaisical film.

The original Total Recall was released in 1990. I remember that when I saw it, it was totally fresh and fascinating. It was very avante garde, ahead of its time. A LOT has changed in film-making since 1990, and if you cannot fabricate a remake that is better than a movie made in 1990, then you just aren't serious. And consider that Farrell is a true actor, whereas Arnold was a bodybuilder who managed to use his fame in that field to get into the acting business. Yet, Arnold's 1990 Houser is far better played than Farrell's. Stone beats out Beckinsale....and that comes from a true-blue Kate Beckinsale fan.

Because of wars, all land masses are destroyed except for two: The United Federation of Britain and The Colony. The first is powerful and in control of the second. The second wants independence.
A man played by Colin Farrell is from The Colony. He comes to The Federation to work in a drudgery job as a factory worker. He is married to a beautiful woman. He is greatly dissatisfied because of his work, a constant dream in which he is unable to save a woman, and because he just lost his job which was given to a man less experienced and able than he because he is from The Colony while the man who is given his job is from The Federation.
He sees advertisements for Rekall. His friend tells him he went through the experience and it was great. Rekall is a system that when the participant receives an injection, the participant thinks he is going through an experience that he wants to go through. He selects being a secret agent. He goes to the shop, a needle is inserted in his arm. Suddenly he hears the doctor say, stop! This man lied to us. Pull out the needle. He is actually a secret agent. Soldiers burst through the door and try to kill him.
From that moment on, Farrell goes through many adventures, there is an almost never-ending series of acts (stunts), many people are killed, he becomes involved in a war to destroy The Colony, he meets and falls in love with a woman who is not his wife, his wife turns out to not be his wife, and much more.",1493856000,,1556,4.350515463917525

4744873,4,B005LAII3U,I never read the book so I'm not sure which is closer to the actual story-this or the original movie with Schwarzenegger. Both are action-packed but this one is darker and has a more current political swing.  I'm glad they didn't try to have Colin Farrell play the role like Schwarzenegger.,1485561600,,290,4.686274509803922

Nauseated me in some scenes and might cause a seizure in some.  You never have the feeling Quaid has any vulnerability at all in this movie making it hard to suspend disbelief.  The pounding he takes and dishes out are so extreme that it's hard to get involved. Characters are cold and dull.  I want my 3 bucks back.,1463356800,,433,4.5

4745761,3,B005LAII3U,"Lots of reviews here. Nothing new to add. I agree with those who say it is unnecessary and a waste of time and lots of money. While I love futuristic cities, they kind of went overboard. It's hard to believe with that kind of technology that the world would be stuck with just two metropolitan areas and had not bothered expanding outward to space. If you've seen the original there is no point in watching this other than some eye candy and lots of action if that is what you like. I don't care for all the action and the last second escapes. When is Hollywood going to learn that daring escapes don't seem so daring if you spend the whole moving doing them and you know there is no chance of failure?

I give it 3 stars because I'm making pretend I never saw the original and it was all new. It's not that it is really bad. We are all comparing it to the previous movie and other sci-fi in general. The plot is same old trash rehashed for the millionth time. If I woke up from being asleep for 25 years I would have thought this movie was awesome and incredible.

4745968,3,B005LAII3U,"Based on a Phillip K. Dick novella, ""Total Recall"" is a futuristic action/adventure movie that revolves around efforts to overthrow a dictatorial world government that oppresses the working class.
That's a common theme for dystopian films and books and it can work really well.
In this case, however, it falls just short of the mark.
Not to be confused with the earlier version of ""Total Recall"" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, this film takes place on a ravaged Earth and not on Mars. It is a darker version of the first movie without any of the humor that Arnold and the original cast brought to the narrative. The urban areas in this version are downright grim and the dialogue reflects that. The special effects are excellent and the acting - especially those scenes featuring Kate Beckinsale - is very good. My problem is that the film doesn't give me a real sense of Colin Farrell's main character - a superspy who has hatched a brilliant plan to thwart the resistance movement. Not enough time is spent in this version developing his character so that I never got a sense as to why he suddenly becomes dedicated to the rebel faction instead of carrying out his mission. In the original film, Schwarzenegger goes through a fairly long transition period. In this version, the spy's conversion boils down to ""I met a woman."" That just wasn't enough for me.

4746182,5,B005LAII3U,"I'm not going to comment on the merits of the movie itself except to say that Philip K Dick's paranoid mind has spawned the most intriguing slew of sci-fi ideas that movie goers have enjoyed over the past few decades.  From Blade Runner to Paycheck to Minority Report etc. and yes even to Total Recall, his peculiar psychosis has caused us to join him in questioning authority, the very nature of reality and in exploring the shifting fringes of morality in an increasingly technological world.  What I want to comment on is the 4K mastering process.  The image definition is stunning (even though I do NOT own an Ultra-HD tv) far exceeding the already exceptional quality of standard 1080p BluRay.  Frankly I was surprised that it made such a big difference on my 60"" Samsung LED.  Images took on a glassy smoothness allowing your eyes to relax and the increased definition appeared to extend to the sound track as well. Bass was tight and explosive and low level ambient information was delivered in spades.  Anyway if you are considering purchasing this movie you've probably already seen it and liked it.  If you are trying to decide if its worth going for the 4K master over a standard edition even if you don't own one of the new Ultra HD tvs - its a no-brainer - GET IT.",1450915200,,1277,4.599118942731278

All I can say, is that it's been a few months now since I purchased this DVD, and I can't really think back to numerous signature scenes like I do now remembering the 1st one. If it's going to follow the original so closely, then why not at least make it a sequel, or another storyline related to the 1st one.

This movie has all the qualities of a great sci-fi film but the true star of the movie was missing for me-Mars! The thing that made the original story so entertaining and whimsical was the concept of a human colony on the one world we constantly dream of which is our closest planetary neighbor. In this film I never really new who was who in the great civil conflict. Both the colony and ruling society were so identical in appearance that it was hard to focus an emotional attachment to the physicality of this sci-fi world. The scenes carried the highly produced and fantastical scenes and technology that is truly a future worth dreaming of much like the original however I found myself constantly wishing for the Martian fragility that the colony faced. In this version I never could figure out what made society so dire that the government had to conspire to take hold of a founded colonies land. Although the population was critical the advancements of this reality were so great that even the desolate and toxic areas outside of the city could have been re-populated so I never felt completely sold on this story. I have to give props to the action and fighting sequences between the stars of this film because they were quite intense and entertaining. Even though the one thing was missing that could have made Total Recall epic and I found its absence irritating I did enjoy the movies effects and view of the future-minus the conflict of course.",1433462400,,1477,4.637404580152672

As a child of the '80s, I've seen the original which probably didn't help this remake any. This film is an action-packed thrill ride blockbuster, and really only deserves one viewing, otherwise the gig is definitely up.

Colin Farrell erases any memory of a hammy Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Jessica Biel is beautiful. Director Wiseman creates a visually stunning world and employs his visually stunning wife.

If the idea of Blade Runner, The Bourne Identity and Robocop having a threesome is the kind of memory you desire, a trip to Total Rekall should do the trick.",1431734400,,843,4.732876712328767

In fact, I would dare say it was better than the original Arnold Schwarzeneggar version (and not just because the effects are more modern, either!)...except one aspect...and this really isn't a spoiler because it is mentioned in the first minutes of the film...but this whole concept of some sort of mechanized travel that goes through the CORE OF THE EARTH is ludicrous. HOWEVER, once I decided to just get past that and ignore the stupidity of such an idea, I was able to sit back and actually enjoy a very entertaining high-tech sci-fi ""chase"" movie that even had a couple fun, nostalgic homages to the original, such as the fight scene in the apartment, the three-boob woman, and the malfunctioning mask. So, with the proper mindset, and ignoring that one blatantly stupid premise around ""The Fall"" transportation mechanism through the Earth's core, it's a fun movie worth watching, especially if you like the sci fi action genre.",1431302400,,990,4.898809523809524
4746996,3,B005LAII3U,"This is how I start all my movie reviews.  I'm not writing a detailed opinion on the movie, I will instead list movies I liked, movies I didn't like, and movies that were just OK.  I will try to pick mostly mainstream movies of multiple genres from mostly recent years.  In this way, I'm hoping people will ignore my opinion and instead get a feel for whether the movie is for them or not.  Besides, this is what reviews are for correct?  To see if it is something YOU would like to see :-)

For my general opinion, the acting was just OK and the action was equally just OK.  I preferred the first one and I'm not a nostalgic person.

Movies I like-All fast and furious, All Marvel, All New Batman Post 2000, Frozen, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Role Models, The Mummy, Stardust, All LOTR, 1408, Haunting in Connecticut, Avatar, Black Swan, Source Code, All the Harry Potters, Tangled, All bond From Casino Royale Forward, First three Pirates of the Caribbean, Kings Speech, District 9, The Social Network, Pitch Perfect

Movies that were just OK-Alice in Wonderland, Buried, Billy Madison, Couples Retreat, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Crank, GI Joe, Hancock, I Am Legend, Priest, Into the Woods,Rain Man, Wanted, The new Total Recall, 22 Jump Street (Credits Very Funny though), Lucy, The Purge, Man of Steel, Limitless, Wolf of Wall street, Devil, The Fighter,

Movies that I Hated- Inglorious Bastards, Kill Bill (All of them), Burn After Reading, Be Kind Rewind, Bridesmaids, Hannah, Prometheus, True Grit (the new one), The Good Shepard, Horrible Bosses, Paul Blart Mall Cop, The Happening, Red, The Other Guys, Watchmen, Brave, Sucker Punch, Green Lantern, Pirates of the Caribbean: on Stranger Tides, Night crawler, The Grey, Bad Teacher.

 There is only one reason to re-make a famous movie that is to make a better, more entertaining and more enjoyable version; otherwise you waste the producers money and the movie viewers time.  This one falls short of the mark, which is a shame because the original was not exactly Casablanca.  It should have been easy to beat.
 Lets examine the good things first.  The acting is top shelf with Colin Farrell in the lead role as a brain altered spy and two strong woman actors in two powerhouse female roles.  Kate Beckinsale plays the brain altered spys fake wife.  The wonderful actress Jessica Biel plays his true love.
 The mood created by Director Len Wiseman is fabulous.  The post apocalyptic world Wiseman builds is crowded, chaotic and desperate.  It reminded me a little of some recent films set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro except futuristic and more awful.  In one of the very few side interludes he explores the nature of a future citizen and finds him as shallow and selfish as some of our own.  The production values are very good all around.
 I don't know what happened to the previously talented writers, Mark Bomback (Live Free Die Hard- a truly satisfying action flick) and Kurt Wimmer (the mediocre Salt and the excellent new version of The Thomas Crown Affair).  They put nothing fun, nothing clever into the script.  Live Free and Thomas Crown while utterly different films both had plenty of the little things that make movie going so much fun.  But not this one.
 The writers take the plausible premise of the original movie, and of the original Sci-Fi story it is based on, and throw it away.  This plausible premise, a revolt on colonial Mars,  is then substituted with something just plain stupid.  Get this, the world is poisoned, only Greater Britain and Australia remain fit to live in and people commute back and forth by taking a fancy elevator through the center of the earth.  It makes my head hurt.  Ok, it is fun to see people get to the middle of the planet and go weightless, but it is still stupid.
 The characters don't have time to evolve or become important to us, they are too busy fleeing or chasing to bother.  The film is one long chase scene, one that goes on so long with such intensity and with such a loud thumping sound track that I eventually got bored with the whole thing.  My movie buddy did the smart thing and went to sleep.  This may be a new movie first, a chase so long and involved that it becomes dull.
 This PG-13 two and a half saw blade film lasts two hours and one minute.  There is one brief glimpse of exposed breasts.  The producers spent $125 million and have had a box office return of only $135 million, not nearly enough to pay the rent.  Beware, another remake of a less than stellar original is coming soon, Dredd, a remake of Judge Dredd.",1427068800,,2836,4.514734774066798

4747493,1,B005LAII3U,"This move bored me to tears. The original was 1000x better. First of all the story is scaled down to a pretty generic dismal future of earth plus a few storm troopers because there was no original thought in this film. Now if you are going to remake a film that was already heavy with special effects, then I guess you can just do what this film did and make the landscape dense with people, machines, and devoid of any nature. That would be ok if they had stuck to the original story of Mars colonization; water rights; oxygen rights etc, but instead, they shrunk the stage, made most of earth off limits, and made this film about greed and power.  I mean, a battle to free humanity from a prison of man made devices was part of the larger story of the original film that was scaled down to freeing ""The Colony"" from oppression from the other guys ( I forget who they were anyway- probably british because Kate Beckinsale started using her accent when she was outed). So this movie lost all of the meaning behind this grand struggle between Colin Farrel and Bryan Cranston. Sure the fighting was good, but they should have just made a fight flick, without calling it total recall. And there was only one mutant, and they didn't even explain why she had 3 breasts-or maybe they did-I was asleep by then.",1426896000,8,1303,4.451882845188284

This one unfortunately though doesn't include Mars.

4747902,1,B005LAII3U,"This movie attempts to re-imagine a story by the late Philip K. Dick. The Schwarzenegger version of the 80's was equally bad even for its time but lets not go there.

What this movie shows is a poorly written script acted out by actors who have scene better days. It wants to be a really good science fiction movie but fails to do so because it seemed to put more emphasis on getting to the fighting and chase scenes rather than wanting to pull the audience into the characters themselves.

If the movie studios wanted to retell a story from a book form then they failed to elaborate on the elements that made Philip K. Dick's short story great and instead made a movie that is all action and no substance.",1422662400,3,706,4.3816793893129775

The original short story by Philip K. Dick is an excellent story with an unexpected ending.  When is Hollywood going to make a version of the story that actually tells the story??????",1422144000,,344,4.896551724137931
4747911,3,B005LAII3U,"First, unfortunately, a couple of technical gripes: (1) the only English soundtrack is TrueHD 5.1 which is usually decoded by our slightly aged but nonetheless excellent AV receiver as DTS. In this case we only got Dolby digital 5.1. (2)The playback of the Blu-ray theatrical version (we haven't watched the extended cut yet) freezes in two places on our LG BD660 player- resolved by rewinding & then replaying. (3) The lip-sync kept slipping - resolved four times during the film by stopping & then resuming playback. We have not encountered these problems with any other Blu-ray disks or DVD's so it can only be down to this disk. These problems significantly reduced our enjoyment of the movie so one star has been lost straight away.

Now, to the film. It is highly likely that anyone watching this is already familiar with the bare bones of the plot from the iconic Arnie version. Visually, this movie is stunning with incredible attention to detail in the soaring cityscapes, the interiors and the street shots with much of the atmosphere borrowed heavily from Bladerunner, the Matrix and even a soupcon of Firefly. The hi-tech special effects are slick and plausible and the whole environment is highly immersive but, of course, thanks to the above technical issues, the level of immersion is somewhat reduced. The story follows the original pretty closely and with frequent nods back to the `classic' version the whole experience is very satisfying but then, about twenty minutes from the end all hell breaks loose and the carefully crafted tension and narrative flow gets totally overwhelmed by lengthy set-piece action sequences.

The cast did their best but with little time devoted to character development (relying, I suppose, on prior knowledge of the Arnie version) they all came across as rather monolithic and the casting of two female leads who look almost identical was confusing to someone like me with appalling facial recognition skills. Poor old Bill Nighy didn't have any chance to bring his usual light touch to the proceeding and his bizarre Agent Smith accent was terrible.

We've now watched the Extended Cut but it isn't noticeably different apart from a few inconsequential scenes, it is only fourteen minutes longer than the theatrical version not the advertised twenty minutes and the alternative ending didn't look any different to us. Playback only froze once, however, but the sound still went out of sync.

All-in-all it was slightly disappointing; this potentially clever re-imagining of Philip K. Dick's short story just got a bit lost in itself and sort-of fizzled out. Shame.",1421452800,,2615,5.088578088578089

4748206,5,B005LAII3U,"I'm writing this review not about my thought on the movie, but my thoughts on it being Mastered in 4K.
I have to say that the movie was incredibly sharp, and the color was pin point accurate. I've seen many Blu Rays that I can tell are clearly being upscaling, but this one I literall thought it was 4K.
Unfortunately, due to the movie being mastered in 4K the blu ray disc can only hold so much so you are getting just the movie. No deleted scenes, no behind the scenes and not alternative endings. You are only getting the movie that you saw in theaters and nothing more. Which I'm fine with, because I never really watch those anyways.
If you don't already own the blu ray yet and you don't care if you get the special features that normally come from owning the movie this I highly suggest that you buy this one over the other one. This movie probably looks better on a 1080p TV than the other one since it was mastered in 4K the color is probably more accurate and the detailing would probably be just as well.
If you already own the movie on blu ray, and have a 4K TV that's not a Sony, then I still suggest you take a chance on this blu ray. If you notice a difference between the two movies, like you should then great. Least then you can watch the special features on the other disc.

I plan on buying the other mastered in 4K blu rays, because I would like to have more content than Netflix and the 10 $30 movies Samsung offers right now.",1419984000,,1448,4.189964157706093

4748329,4,B005LAII3U,"Really good sci-fi movies are ones that take technology we're working on now and envision what it could be a few years down the road. Really great sci-fi movies make that vision seem not only possible, but completely real. In that respect, Total Recall succeeded more often than it failed.

I had never seen the original, so I decided to do a mini-marathon and watch both movies back to back. I think that actually helped me appreciate the remake for what it was - an updated spin on the original. There were a few major changes to the plot (Mars vs. Earth colonies), but overall the remake follows pretty much the same storyline as the original. There were enough nods to the 1990 version to make me feel as though I was definitely watching a re-do and not something new, but that's okay. It was almost fun to pick out all the similarities - some were glaringly obvious (hard not to notice a three-breasted woman in both movies), but there were also loads of subtle lines and scenes that showed a lot of respect for what the original cast & crew accomplished.

The real gem of the re-make, though, is the fantastic use of special effects and futuristic technology. Sure, there were a few hokey spots (elevator through the Earth, for example), but on the whole most of what I saw seemed completely believable. Almost 50 years ago, the hand-held communicators in Star Trek were mind-blowing. Now we all take our touch-screen cell phones for granted. So a phone embedded in a person's hand - which can link to any glass surface to create a video-chat - not only is that unbelievably cool, but it seems totally possible. I watch & read a ton of sci-fi and embedded links are pretty common in the genre. But I have never seen a communication device done quite that way before (usually it's a back of the hand thing). Major points for creativity there!

In general, the special effects enhanced the movie in all the right ways. Lately I've seen a lot of movies that go really overboard with GCI - to the point that it ruins the movie. Thankfully, this movie managed to avoid that trap. Even though the majority of the movie had to be green screen, I couldn't tell. There's a lot of action and fight sequences, but it still stayed grounded in reality (no actors suddenly turning into CGI people who bounce, for example). Most of the special effects were futuristic technology - holograms, hover cars, etc. - and I thought all of that blended seamlessly into the background environment of the movie. The holographic message board on the fridge, for example - or the gun that shoots laser-beam lassos (now THAT'S a cool upgrade to a taser!). If for no other reason, this movie is worth seeing just to get a look at all the futuristic tech we'll hopefully have someday.

The acting was also better than the original. I'm not generally a fan of Arnold, so I found Colin Farrell to be a nice upgrade to the Douglas Quaid character. Kate Beckinsale did a nice job as a rabid Terminator, and Farrell & Jessica Biel had enough chemistry between them to keep their characters interesting. But the real surprise for me was Bryan Cranston. His performance as the villain in Total Recall was so good that I didn't even recognize him. It wasn't until the very end of the movie that I even realized he was the same guy who played the wacky dad on Malcolm in the Middle!

Overall I really liked the re-make. It's darker and grittier than the original, but I felt it was appropriate for the dystopian setting of the movie. For me it's a solid 4.5 stars, and definitely one I will be adding to my collection.",1419033600,,3585,4.551937984496124

The special effects are good, the fight choreography is rather good, it boasts an all star cast, it has an interesting environment that looks like a cross between Star Wars super cities and Blade Runner industrial darkness, and that is about all that is good.  Too many stunt scenes, non-stop edge of your seat ""excitement"" with almost no plot, and characters with little depth (one dimensional in many cases).  The mystery about whether the experience is real or Rekall is explored only superficially.  The movie is basically one big chase scene (running from his overzealous wife, played by Kate Beckinsale).  It has nothing to do with mutants, Mars, control of the air you breathe, or anything that made the original movie so intriguing.  There is nothing wrong with changing elements or expanding upon elements of a story; the problem is, the story was almost eliminated in exchange for non-stop ""action"".  The central futuristic ideas are some absurd notion of travelling through the Earth's core to get between Britain and Australia (everywhere else on Earth is toxic wasteland), and ""synthetics"" (robot police/soldiers, which are central to the story but ultimately almost completely irrelevant).  Spoiler Alert: There is no saving the world in any form; the core elevator thing gets blown up, preventing an invasion of synthetics from Britain to Australia.  That's it.

I know there's all kinds of special effects and it's chock full of non-stop action, but Colin Farrell just can't act his way out of a paper bag. It's true, he's a wuss and it is just not believable at all.
Kate and Jessica played their roles very well, for what they were given, but the lead actor should have been someone else. Someone dynamic.
It's just not wise sometimes to keep doing remakes of movies. Technology does not make up for plot and acting ability or star power.

4749112,2,B005LAII3U,More fun to look at then the original for a little while.  The story world makes less sense than the plot so the visuals are eventually a wasted distraction.  Collin's Quaid pulls martial skills out of his hat 'a la' Jason Bourne but clear up to the end he's still in denial about his identity shift.  Arnold's Quaid had the sense to accept that people were trying to kill him and the brawn to beat the hell of them for trying until he could figure out why.

They tried to pay respect to the original Total Recall by using some of the same things that stuck out in the 1st movie....but overall I didn't like that there was too much action and shooting in this version vs a more slower relaxed paced in most parts in the original. Also, what turned me off in this TR was the casting for the 2 female roles. I think that Kate Beckinsale needed more training for the fight scenes. Also, Jessica Biel did pretty good in her role, but I would have liked to have seen someone more ethnic like Jennifer Lopez or Rosario Dawson in this movie.....or even better a no name ethnic actress would have been perfect. Collin Farrell does well when the weather of the movie is calmer around him if he is playing an average guy role. Overall, the actors did good, but it just went flat for me at the car chase scene with Jessica Biel about 1/3 of the way through the movie.

It's mostly just a straight up action flick with lots of chase scenes (~75%). The characters are okay, though the two female leads looked crazy similar. Pretty sure that was done purposefully, but it got confusing, especially watching them fight. You could barely keep them straight.

Colin Farrell does a decent acting job. His character was the only one that required much depth. The two female leads can be boiled down to good chick (one trying to escape with him), bad chick (one trying to kill them).

4750212,2,B005LAII3U,"Enjoyed the movie but very disappointed with the Blu Ray copy. It had a terrible problem of audio dropouts (every 2-5 minutes) throughout the movie. Realised later that many reviews pointed out this problem. Could not rely on an exchange from the distributor/manufacturer -Sony, from what is informed by other buyers from other websites. There was a solution of changing the audio setting on the Blu Ray player which is to set the audio downmix/output from Auto/Dolby,DTS 5.1 to PCM. But this ruins the whole point of having a Blu Ray and enjoying the great sound effects of an action movie. I was able to keep the the digital settings (Auto/Dolby,DTS 5.1) by pausing the movie and/or slow rewind(reverse) a couple of seconds/frames then resume playing the movie, and this will enable a normal audio playback without dropouts for at least 20-30 minutes.

A lot of effort was put into the visuals (think modern day 'Blade Runner', 'I-Robot', and a couple of others) and that effort alone, along with the pretty decent acting and dreary atmosphere, earns it at least a middle of the road rating.

All that being said, I didn't like Colin Farrell playing the lead as much as I did Arnold Schwarzenegger's original.  But I did really like the toughness and moves of his ""wife"" in this movie as played by Kate Beckinsale.

Some spoilers below:

A man stuck in a dead-end job making robots goes to Total Rekall (they re-spelled it, not sure why?) and falls right down the rabbit hole into a game of lost memories, spies, terrorists, and a woman in his dreams coming to life.  Is this just been loaded into his head by Total Rekall and he is now in danger of being lost in this fake reality...or did it trigger the fact that he was always secretly a spy?  What follows is a thriller as they race through this world chased by a woman he assumed had been his wife, but turns out to be a govt agent.  They travel from the Colony (Australia) to Britain down ""the Fall,"" a tunnel that carries them from one side of the planet to another as they fight a plot for Britain to take over the Colony entirely.  (This was the biggest technlogical issue--if they can punch a hole through the planet and actually survive going by the heat of the core, why do they need what amounts to slave labor...not that anyone could really survive going near the core of the Earth anyway.)

The residual biologic agents were too overwhelming to eradicate, however if you just but on a gas mask you're good to go.

The 13th floor-was a sci-fi without all the toys for making special affects not being wowed like in the Matrix.

4750973,5,B005LAII3U,"I had no real expectations about this movie, but came away impressed. I am a huge fan of science fiction films, but not enough to keep watching if the particular movie is absolutely atrocious or doesn't hold my interest. Fortunately, that wasn't the case at all here.

The very first thing I noticed was the very well-done backdrop upon which the story takes place. This isn't another sci-fi movie set on a sparsely populated desert or jungle planet with some aliens and laser guns thrown in to make it futuristic, or on some generic small space station in tight corridors. Nope, you see the whole Earth, big cityscapes, giant intra-planetary elevators connecting the hemispheres, dingy retro-futuristic slums, and much more, all brought to life with surprising attention to detail and style. And yeah, it really looks good.

Contrasting the previous incarnation of the film, the action doesn't take place on Mars, but on a post-nuclear war Earth with the two remaining governments existing in radiation-free zones in Europe and Australia. The British/European colony is your typical futuristic Utopia with a dirty little secret, while Australia / ""The Colony"" is portrayed as much grittier and darker. It's not quite dystopian per se, but it has a grungy mega-city feel clearly inspired by Blade Runner and maybe with a little bit of the ""Dredd"" remake aesthetic thrown in. This dichotomy brings to mind another recent film, Upside Down, which also had gorgeous visuals, but of a twin-planet system where the ""Up Above"" world was a veritable Utopia that fed off the poor, working class world of ""Down Below.""  However, while Upside Down focused more on a dramatic love story and the clever - if implausible - premise, Total Recall is all about the action.

That action does not disappoint. There's a great exposition in the beginning, showing off and establishing the world and backstory, and introducing us to Colin Farrell's role as Quiad the factory worker. Once the inevitable secret is slipped, great chase and fight scenes abound, interspersed by segments which build on the story and add a decent (but not ""thriller""-worthy) amount of suspense and mystery. As can be expected, CGI is highly utilized for the action, but it's well done and never feels like it's there just to exist.

The story is a fresh take on the original, but to me was just as appealing. The political and social overtones are there, but honestly aren't any more obvious than in something like, say, the original RoboCop (still haven't seen the remake of that one), which was very well received. Though I won't spoil it, the mystery behind the ""original"" Quaid and who he was/is kept me guessing literally til the end. The acting was also well done, bringing life to the story. Colin Farrell was particularly entertaining to watch. as he is good with the character-driven parts and very convincing with subtleties in his performance during the action. As a factory worker, Quaid knows he ""shouldn't"" know all these crazy action moves he is performing, and seems continually surprised by himself as his former-self's reflexes and hidden knowledge keep his present-self alive. All of the supporting roles are well played as well, with lots of big names offering quality acting, even when the script isn't the most outstanding.

Overall, I am very happy with this rendition of Philip K Dick's original story. I am more surprised than anything, really, because I had heard it was a very mediocre reboot, but as far as sci-fi action films go, I don't think you could ask for anything more. It combines visuals almost as beautiful as those in the sappy ""Upside Down"" with a backstory almost as clever as the one in ""Source Code"" with better action than either. I would highly recommend at least giving this iteration a try, for fans of action, adventure, or science fiction movies.

It was near the beginning and the issue was cleared in a couple of minutes, but it was still annoying.

Fight Scenes darkly lit , Special Effects Mediocre CGI, even the acting was flat. The whole movie was one big fast chase. You cannot relate to the characters in this version, their purpose an meaning do not stand out. This is where the boring comes in.
Colin Farrell is good actor, I like him, in this movie though he was sort of wooden, he was just there, he in no way can make a stronger screen presence than Arnold, He didn't contribute anything to the character. This movie has dark broodish scenes that serve no purpose. The action and fighting scenes were mediocre to any other action movie today. The Original movie contained IN YOUR FACE action and true special effects, there were no dark night(cant see a thing) scenes. This movie did re-arrange the whole Mars story to the point of asking yourself ""why even change it"". To someone who has never seen the original, this might be a fantastic movie.

4751541,2,B005LAII3U,"Okay lets start with the good. This reworking of the 1990 blockbuster looks great. A world recovering from chemical warfare is well imagined and the special effects are impressive. There are numerous references, both visual and audio, to the original movie and to Blade Runner (which remains the best Philip K. Dick adaptation to date). The set pieces are well choreographed and production values in general are very high. And it has the lovely Kate Beckinsale in it. But thats about it for the plus side. On the downside this is basically a 120 minute chase scene interspersed with brief moments of cod philosophy and simplistic moralising. It also lacks the wit and playfulness of the original, and is even farther removed from the source material (in fairness they do state that its only inspired by the PKD story). There is at least one major plot hole and Brain Cranston is miscast as Cohaagen (although he does his best with his meagre part).

You would think that would be a pretty hard thing to put together and make work.  Especially the going through the molten center of the Earth part.  Ouch.

4751545,4,B005LAII3U,"If you love si-fi action there's a good chance that you will enjoy this movie. I am usually the first one to write off remakes, particularly a remake of such a great sci-fi film, but when a different take can be presented on the story it can make for an enjoyable and in the least entertaining viewing experience.

The visuals are on a top notch level as far as CGI goes. The world that was created here was honestly a larger and more immersive one than in the original. I personally loved the dystopian/cyberpunk theme that was developed here and thought it worked perfectly with this story. Colin Farrell did a great job playing Douglas Quaid, and while there is no measurement to Schwarzenegger's performance, he held his own.

A lot of people have complained about the lack of seeing Mars or any of the mutants, I think that was a direction taken in the original that made it so strange. Even with the security scene where we see a woman who somewhat resembles the decoy suit Arnie wore in the original, it was nothing more than a nod, as this movie's Quaid was using a different disguise.

The original is a more pleasurably violent and bizarre indulgence, but this is an acceptable update for the 21st century. The truth is, there just aren't enough good futuristic sci-fi movies released these days so that makes this movie a little more appealing. There is a ton of action in it (something snobby critics have panned) and tense moments to keep you on the edge of your seat.

The recently released director's cut adds an additional 10 minutes to the movie connecting plot points and smoothing the film over so it has a better, more cohesive feel to it.

However, if you bitstream this to your receiver, you'll get sound dropouts, at least on my version. It appears to be a watermarking/anti piracy thing. As usual, Sony only pisses off people who buy their stuff legitimately with their anti piracy techniques. The solution in my case is to change the setting on my bluray player to PCM.

First of all, where are all the mutants?  There was ummm... one?  That broad with the three, you know, like the original movie. The one thing that made the original Total Recall all the more interesting to watch was because of the mutant population.
Second, where is mars? The idea Britian/Australia settlements, I mean, ummm... DUMB!!!! The original Mars environment made the story way better, more sci-fi-ish.
Third, because of the first two reasons, the story-line had to be changed so much, that throughout the rest of the movie, it was more like, ""why this?"" and ""why that?"" and ""that's stupid!"" and ""are you kidding me?"" and ""why was this part changed?""

4751899,1,B005LAII3U,"When I saw the announcement of this remake, I wondered, ""Why?"" The original starred the top action actor of the 80s AND the 90s. It had state of the art special effects, a great cast, and an engaging storyline. I wondered what these guys thought they could add that would make me want to watch this movie in preference to the original.

The answer is: Nothing.

* This plot is a mess
* The art direction seemed fixed on Garbage/Slum Deco
* There were literally no special effects that I preferred to anything in the original
* I didn't find anything clever to make me think the writers/director had an original thought in their heads
* The acting is rather blah and unconvincing
* They failed to ""sell"" their bad guy or his ""evil plot"" ... they did nothing in the story to make me care

The only bright spot I can see to this film is that it failed so miserably at the box office ($125 million estimated budget, $59 million US box office) that hopefully decision makers will think long and hard about letting the people responsible for this loser make any more films. This director also made what most consider to be the worst of the ""Die Hard"" series (not easy to screw up with Bruce Willis as your star, either), and the principal writer has only impressed me with his ""Thomas Crown Affair"" remake.

This was an utter waste of an evening for my wife and I. I've been watching movies for a LONG time now, and I have never really made a decision on whether or not to watch a film based on who the writers and director are. I may have to start paying attention to that. These guys who think that a frenetic action pace covers up for nonsense plotting are getting more and more common in Hollywood. They are badly deluded and I don't want to be suckered into any more of their failures.

But hey, if you like 118 minutes of virtually non-stop chase sequences that don't contain any logic or make any sense, then you'll just love this film. LOL",1387324800,11,1941,4.3805555555555555

Remake or not Phillip K. Dick stories are simply perfect for post-Inception audiences (in fact I wanted a spinning top for the end). The twisted identity juggling in TOTALLY in now if I RECALL correctly (Sorry)... A guy goes for some SPY memory implants and has them already, but THEY'RE REAL, or so he thinks... Then again maybe not. This is more of a remake of the 90's film than the original PKD story ""We can remember it for you Wholesale."" This time with Collin Farrell in Arnold's role, as Doug Quaid a.k.a Carl Hauser, a factory Joe who's  suffering from action-hero night terrors. Other great gets include: Bryan Cranston as Cohaagen evil Chancellor of the UFB , another Underworld Veteran Bill Nighy is Matthias. Kate Beckinsale is amazing as kick-a$$ 'Lori Quaid UFB agent ( I expect Sharron Stone is writing her hate-mail as I write this), this time the lovely Jessica Biel as Melina, a member of the Resistance. Overall its a good film but I thought Biel and Beckonsale's look and body types were so similar (confusingly so at times in action edits) that i'd hoped some more deliberate twist end would come up to make this decision make sense. The Look of 21st cen United Federation of Britain and Australia is more Blade Runner-ish than the original RECALL, I like the verticalness of it, and speaking of Vertical this remake contains possibly the best elevator shaft sequence since DIE HARD!

Having said that, it takes off running and never stops. I liked it a lot and it edges out Arnie's by a hair, action-wise, that is. The downside is that Kate Beckinsale delivers her usual slam bang, monochromatic, breathless performance. She could have swallowed as many flies as she uttered the word ""S***.""
Jessica Biel, on the other hand, delivers a slam bang, monochromatic, breathless performance. In fact, the two are all but indistinguishable in their breathlessness. Still, Colin Farrell really saves it.
Having just watched the ""Making of Avatar"" I was more aware of the special effects. They are stunning and I wish, now, I had watched it on the big screen.

4752259,1,B005LAII3U,"This remake demonstrates how to make a REALLY BAD action film -- and there are a lot of them out there!

The main problem is that this film is missing the HUMAN ELEMENT. There are no CHARACTERS we can love, hate, admire, or care about in any way. They're all one-dimensional stick figures. And if you don't care about the characters, you can't be engaged in their struggle.

The script is so SIMPLISTIC, in a typically bad action movie way. The evil (dictatorship, corporation, empire, military, whatever) is entirely evil. The good guys (rebels, resistance, revolutionaries, whatever) are entirely noble. No nuances, moral dilemmas, etc. Compare that to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001I189MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>, in which Batman's moral role as a vigilante was questioned, the Joker observing that Batman was seen as a freak by the very people he was defending.

Even worse, in this TOTAL RECALL remake (and in a typically bad action film sort of way), no good guy is AT RISK. It's one of those films where hundreds of (storm troopers, soldiers, gangsters, whatever) shoot a bajillion zillion bullets the Good Guy, and not one of them strikes. And because you KNOW that not a single bullet will hit the Good Guy, there's ZERO SUSPENSE. This film was just one long, extended, two-hour chase sequence/gun battle, yet despite that, I was BORED.

Any ONE slasher in a horror film racks up a higher body count that the literally hundreds of evil robots shooting a bajillion bullets in this TOTAL RECALL remake. Isn't it sad, when a low-budget slasher film is actually more suspenseful and exciting than this ($100 million plus?) studio effort?

Compare this TOTAL RECALL remake to one of the best action films ever:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rock/dp/6304711891/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rock</a>. There you had not two sides, but five ""sides"" -- most of them complex and morally ambiguous. A film full of twists and surprises. There was the 1. Terrorist/Military Hero, who had noble motives and whose intent turned out to be decent, 2. the Establishment Cops who were fighting the terrorist, yet through immoral means, 3. the Hero Cop, Nicolas Cage, who betrayed his cop bosses, 4, the Prisoner, Sean Connery, a villain who was charged with rescuing the day from the terrorist, and 5. the Terrorist Rebels, who suddenly betrayed their leader, for even more immoral reasons and intent.

The fewer chases and pyrotechnics in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rock/dp/6304711891/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rock</a>&nbsp;were more exciting, because I cared about its morally complex characters/sides, and was constantly surprised by unexpected plot twists.

Whereas this TOTAL RECALL remake was one long, paint-by-number, predictable snoozefest. While watching the incessant chases, I was actually wondering about the CGI budget, and various other things, instead of being emotionally involved with the events onscreen.",1380672000,3,3112,5.81140350877193

One peoples oppressing another on such a global scale makes you think about things we do today. At not so deep...

4752264,1,B005LAII3U,"First off, any review of Total Recall (2012) must compare it to Total Recall (1990), and in just about every way possible, the newer one comes up short.  Say what you want about Schwarzenegger's acting, he owned and sold the role in a way that Colin Farrell's sleepy, ballet-choreographed-fighting could not.

Then there was the appalling decision to combine the Sharon Stone and Michael Ironside characters into a single Kate Beckinsale role, which failed on every possible level.

Set design was accomplished by blatantly ripping off ""Blade Runner,"" with additional contributions from ""The Matrix,"" and ""Minority Report.""  The Rekall store went from looking like a futuristic dentist's office to a hidden P.F. Chang's restaurant, for reasons that are utterly baffling -- isn't this supposed to be a major corporation, that advertises world-wide, like McDonald's?  Why would it be hard to find?

The CGI wizardry of the modern day somehow looks tired and absurd compared to the effects Verhoeven achieved with technology 20 years older.

I'm pretty sure there was a paragraph of dialogue that was lifted nearly verbatim from ""The Matrix"" when Morpheus is explaining to Neo that the brain simply detects electro-chemical inputs.

Pacing was an absolute nightmare.  It went from slow, when Quaid is trying to figure things out, to slower, when they would commence one of the combat-ballets.

Nothing was set up, and nothing was paid off.  There are battle droids, and sometimes they're bulletproof, and sometimes, you can shoot them.  There's a subway that goes through the Earth's molten rock and solid iron core.  (BTW, the ENTIRE trip on ""The Fall"" would be at Zero-G to the occupants, not just the middle five seconds.)  The rest of the world is uninhabitable because of ""chemical weapons,"" but you can survive in it just by wearing a gas mask.  Cohaagen, the chief bad guy (and ""Chancellor""), is out there wearing a bulletproof vest with his suit trousers, on the front line with his troops.  It would be like if President Obama had personally accompanied Seal Team Six to track and kill Osama Bin Laden.  Jessica Biel's character was a cipher - we knew nothing about her, and she had nothing to do but provide occasional support for Colin Farrell.  We didn't care about any of the characters.  What's that?  You're going to launch a genocidal invasion?  Okay.  Go ahead.  I have nothing invested in anybody here.  Most of the characters with speaking parts don't even live in that part of the world, anyway.

The high point of this movie is the most boring car chase scene you have ever watched.  I honestly had to reflect and figured out how they pulled it off.  They have good CGI, explosions, and capable drivers.  It hit me towards the end of the movie.  Whoever wrote this movie has a thing for elevators, an incredibly dull machine.  While you watch, count how many times they escape by running into an elevator, and the doors slowly close.  Or they almost get blown up in an extremely slow moving elevator.  Oh my god... oh my god.  The whole movie, is an ode to elevators.  I swear - please you must watch this movie to vindicate me.  Everything, even the main form of transport, is an elevator.

(It may have won the Academy award?)  This version is better because of the update effects throughout.  The first film looks a aged and boxy by comparison (technology).  The second reason I like this film better is Kate Beckinsale. (sic)  If movie villains make a movie then she deserves much of the credit for any success this movie enjoys.  As good as Sharon Stone was in the original, Beckinsale out does her in every category.  Who knew the Predator and the Terminator characters could be re-done, combined in a size 2!!
I didn't give it four stars because the lead (Colin Farrell) played the Arnold (Shwartzeneggar) sic. role without ever trying to make anything of it.  I think he was still confused about who he was when the credits were rolling or he was in another reality at ""Rekall"" any way he was 5 to Beckinsale's 10.  The movie actually was not ""Totally"" different than the original.  Both butchered the true ""reality"" of the story by Phillip K. Dick, imho.",1376956800,2,1127,4.728205128205128

4752628,2,B005LAII3U,"Colin Farrell was great in Minority Report. I'm not sure how he ended up in Total Recall and Fright Night because neither film gave him much to work with in terms of dialogue or story. Total Recall is about a guy who discovers his identity has been tampered with. The original story was very creative but this version is watered down despite the larger budget. It seems they didn't put as much into sets, creativity or plot in favor of action and special-effects. What's the problem? This film has none of the fun or ultra-violence of Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1990 version. This is dark, depressing and redundant at times. It recycles sets from Blade Runner, Judge Dredd and other films which looks cool but ultimately feels paper-thin because the story is eschewed for computer effects. The effects do look good but are not totally convincing because of how overdone they are. It's somewhat of a chore to sit through at times because it seems like Farrell and his lovely co-stars are setting something up but they never get off the ground. They had great source material in ""We Can Remember it for You, Wholesale"" by Philip K. Dick but that doesn't seem to be a source of inspiration here. Total Recall managed to gross only half its budget in the US; it bombed in theaters. The worst part? They don't go to Mars! The story is about ""The Fall"" (which is some kind of underground elevator) and how it will save us all. Don't ask. Amazingly this movie gets a 2-disc release with special features.

4752944,4,B005LAII3U,"Total Recall 2012 is a remake of the Total Recall 1990 movie. By establishing the plot on Earth instead of Mars, this remake attempts to make a more realistic world for the story to take place. But it could have been more plausible to establish a colony on Mars as in the original 1990 movie, than it would have to make a tunnel that runs through the very center of the Earth as in this remake. Otherwise it made believable through special effects and conceptualization, the environments and technology. It has that well adapted `Blade Runner' dystopian feel.

The plot revolves around the question of what reality is. The original movie relied heavily on surreal interpretations of technology, and absurd fantastic moments, which further muddled the line of reality that messed with the viewer's mind. This to me is what was lost in this remake.

In this movie many mourn the replacement of the charismatic but aptly ridiculous Arnold Schwazenegger with Colin Farrell. But as the remake goes for the more `realistic' approach I think Colin Farrell a good replacement. Kate Beckinsale is fantastic as she hams up a nasty villain, she wears something tight and this doesn't hurt the eyes at all. I miss her when she is not on the screen.

I have no regrets at this buying remake, it is a fun special effects movie. I was still interested on how this remake would interpret a plot that I am already familiar with. I drank good beer and ate beef hotdogs and slices of mature cheddar while viewing this, but soda and popcorn will do well if that is your preference.",1372464000,,1561,4.689781021897811

It wasn't about Mars and the only high tech things they had were a tunnel thru the earth and hovering magnetic cars and I guess these android police guys that looked to much like guys in metal suits. Colin Farrell just looked like a guy playing a part in a movie and not real convincing. Kate Beckinsale showed in this movie she's not only gorgeous but a great actress.

4752946,4,B005LAII3U,"Another reviewer said it perfectly, ""Different enough from the original to be entertaining"".  I am not usually a big fan of movie remakes or re-boots, but this version of the Arnold classic put a twist of the original script to make it new again.  This is not an Arnold remake, rather a fresh new look at how the original story could have gone.  Colin Farrell is great as Quaid, and the sexy Kate Bekinsale and Jessica Biel fill in the movie with good action and eye candy.  Those who may complain about it not being as good as the original, you need to stop comparing them because they are not the same movie.

The only problem I had was with the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  It constantly kept dropping out.  I exchanged the movie for a replacement and it did the exact same thing at the exact same points in the film.  Amazon gave me a phone number for Sony to call about the issue (Which proves they know there IS an issue).  Sony said to go into the menu of my BluRay player and change the digital audio output to PCM, and that should fix it.  Well, I did what they said and it did fix the drop-outs.  But it was no longer a Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  It was a standard PCM 2 channel stereo track which played through my system in the old outdated Dolby Pro Logic from the 1980's surround technology.  For me, this defeated the whole idea of having a nice 7.1 home theater system.  So I returned the second disc for a refund until they can fix the soundtrack.  I may try to buy it locally in a store, but if it does the same thing, Sony should hang their heads in shame for not fixing this.

Sony should RECALL (no pun intended)the BluRay discs of this movie, and reissue new discs with a Dolby TreuHD soundtrack that works.",1372291200,2,1725,4.294117647058823
4752947,2,B005LAII3U,"Redo this movie is plain wrong to begin with.

And the change they made was a lousy one, even less entertaining comparing to Arnold.

I'm really being fair to this movie, I tried to like it. And here's what I think.

Pro:
1)the graphic and technology taken in this movie is the only thing that you can say it surpass the first, but what do you expect after 25 years? Computer generated objects are pretty much flawless. And some angles at some scene are breath taken. But it really took down by the other facts.

2) The actors are more handsome, you can arguably say Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale are better at presence than Arnald and Sharon Stone respectively, forgive me but I would say the first one's acting seem more natural to me.

Con:
1) first off, no Mars?? this really pissed me off when I watched it, the Mars Myth was the key plot to the whole story, instead they have the splited colonies when it play absolutely no part in the story, this is a BIG BIG thumb down, way down way way down to bottom of the sewer.

They took it out because Mars colony isn't reality ( that no matter how hard scientist try it won't happen ever). But thats the first mistake they made that they can't distingulish the fake reality and possible future. In science fiction nobody argue what's possible in the future, when it isn't happening yet, just doesn't mean it won't. And that's what we used to like the first movie, introduce what it could be but not it gonna be.

2) no humor, this is another one I found hard to take it down, when I saw the first movie I was both impressed by how the plot was breath taken and how some scene was hilarious - like that when you see Arnald shot his ex wife and say ""consider that a divorce"". Instead they have everybody tighten their vein and read something out of the script.. it's uninspiring at the best.

3) no mutants, *sigh, they missed out all the goodies

4) no world change at the end, the ending of original was one of the most reflesh memory experience I had on movies, the world changed about 180 degrees at the last 5 minutes. And the movie lovely throw you a question to its reality just before blackout end credit roll up. This movie practically got nothing..

I used to call the first movie ""total retard"" for humor, but this, I don't bother to have another minute engage to it.

4753013,4,B005LAII3U,"It's tough as bricks to disassociate the remake from the original. While watching the new TOTAL RECALL, I couldn't help but compare it to the Schwarzenegger film. And if you put nostalgia aside, this 2012 version doesn't really pale in comparison. Two main shifts particularly strike me. The first, obviously, is that Colin Farrell's ""Douglas Quaid"" isn't as imposing or, frankly, as charismatic a presence as Schwarzenegger's. Actually, with Farrell's Quaid, there's a more palpable sense of personal jeopardy. Second, there is no interstellar flight to Mars. All the action takes place on a post-apocalyptic earth. But there is a fun nod to Schwarzenegger's misadventure thru the space port checkpoint.

If only them crusading environmentalists could use these dystopian sci-fi movies to legitimately get their point across, we may all be sustainability conscious by now. TOTAL RECALL presents another cautionary tale, evokes one more dark vision of the future. At the close of the 21st century, global chemical warfare has rendered most of the planet uninhabitable. Living space has become the most valuable resource. Two territories remain: the impoverished Colony and the powerful United Federation of Britain.

In a world of soulless synthetic police and corporate corruption, Douglas Quaid is a factory worker on an assembly line who dwells in the hard-up Colony. Quaid must every day commute halfway around the world to the UFB by way of the Fall, the sole means of transportation between the two territories. On the day he gets passed over for a promotion, a distraught Quaid visits Rekall, a revolutionary company that can turn fantasies into ""real"" memories. Perhaps inspired by recurring weird dreams, Quaid selects the secret agent package for his fantasy of choice. He gets strapped in.

If you haven't seen the original or read the source material - Phillip K. D!ck's 1966 short story, ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" - then you're in for a sweet puzzle. TOTAL RECALL blurs the line between fantasy and reality, and I remember the surging anxiety I felt back in 1990 when Quaid is confronted with the possibility that he may be trapped in a dream state. So, I was saying, one paragraph back: He gets strapped in. But then the memory implant procedure is interrupted when the police busts into Rekall and begins to shoot the place up. Quaid springs into action and is shocked by how effortlessly he takes out the entire police squad. Douglas Quaid is now a man on the run.

How does Quaid fit into the Resistance the UFB chancellor (Bryan Cranston) is so desperate to stamp down? Why can he suddenly play the piano? Is he really suffering from a paranoid disassociative break? There are fun homages to the Schwarzenegger picture (three-breasted prostitutes, anyone?). But there's enough of a divergence from the 1990 plot that you can enjoy it as a separate narrative. Okay, there's the occasional plot point obfuscation, but the screenplay has enough smarts, even if it's not as grand in scale, and I love that the set designs exude a dark and dingy Bladerunner vibe. Kate Beckinsale really sells the badass Sharon Stone part, and Kate may well be today's best action female star, she's so effortless and dynamic in her physicality. The film's best action sequence has to be the frenetic extended chase sequence with Beckinsale and Farrell, early on. Jessica Biel is also very good, although she doesn't get to exert herself as much as Beckinsale in the asskickery department. Colin Farrell presents a more believable character than Schwarzenegger's because he cuts a more average figure, which means that we relate to him better. I do feel, though, that Farrell gets a bit lost in the middle of all the big sci-fi goings-on. I wish his dial went past ""stoic."" Maybe his character should've picked a more extroverted part, like a kindergarten cop or Danny DeVito's twin.

Lastly, I'll say that the bead of sweat, and not the drop of tear, was more convincing.

4753014,4,B005LAII3U,"Sony tips you off a little bit by saying this,

""The Blu-ray ""Mastered in 4K"" collection is optimized so that 4K Ultra HD TV owners can take full advantage of the new 4K upscaling technology, delivering an outstanding near-4K experience. ""Mastered in 4K"" Blu-rays also work with all 1080p HDTVs for spectacular high definition picture and sound.""

What they actually did to ""Master in 4k"", I don't know. What I do know, and Sony admits, is that this Blu-ray (and the others) are not versions of these movies in native 4k resolution. They are merely ""optimized so that 4K Ultra HD TV owners can take full advantage of the new 4K upscaling technology."" The important part of that quote is ""upscaling technology."" Sony 4k tv's have this new ""upscaling technology"" that takes 1080p resolution movies and, through a computer algorithm, makes them more well defined. Standard upscaling for 4k would be giving every pixel in 1080p 3 additional exact copies of that pixel to create the 4k image. Sony's upscaling, in contrast to what I just described, shades those 4 pixels to match what is around them, thereby creating a better picture overall. The bottom line is that a Blu-ray in 4k would be about 200GiB. This is not currently available and not what is being sold as of 2013. Blu-ray says that they are working on it though, so hopefully we will have it soon.

You can check out how Sony's ""upscaling technology"" looks at your local Best Buy. It is very cool and my experience with the technology was very positive. Check it out and form your own opinion.

4753124,4,B005LAII3U,"Colin Farrell is one of the most criticized actors in Hollywood. Some of the criticism is just, but then again, there are movies that are supposed to have deeper meaning, then there are REMAKES. Let me start my review by saying this: A REMAKE is not at all meant to be the original, though a remake may have direct connection and influence from the original a REMAKE is just what it says; the same thing just done in a different way or form. That said, you can call me crazy, but in my opinion Total Recall is a good movie. Is it perfect or award worthy? Absolutely not, but then again its not meant to be. Total Recall knows exactly what it is: A Fast paced Science fiction action flick. It DOES have the action, the intensity, and style that a movie like this needs. Colin Farrell did a good enough job as Doug Quaid or (Carl Hauser if you prefer). Then we have Jessica Biel as Melina and Kate Beckingsale as Lori( I liked her character). Ethan Hawke  makes a surprise cameo; it is brief, but nice to see him in this movie. The story line is what it is: Fast, Suspensful, and unfortunately at times predictable. But despite that, I still like Total Recall. This movie may be disliked for not being true to the original or simply disliked because people may actually just not like the movie. So I will go no further in my review and to close, Total Recall gets

They obviously spent a lot on this flop, but at the end of the day it all was squandered because the Casting Director was apparently Holistically Incompetent, the writers were tripping all over each other desperately trying to out do themselves & Common Sense, and then that perpetual disappointment Colin Farrell with his halfwit ""Wounded Puppy"" Demeanor & Fixed Facial Expression, simply couldn't measure-up to the task at hand no matter what the task.  No really, I haven't  ANYTHING  against Colin Ferrell, and if I never see another of his shows  I can probably keep saying that.

I watched the extended version (which I love) and felt the video looked decent enough (maybe because of the lower bit rate?) but the colors just didn't pop out like they should for a 2013 blu ray. Good enough, I guess. I took the chance on getting this ""newer"" version transferred from 4K source (down to 1080p for standard blu ray) and was blown away after seeing this newer version. The colors really shine on this version and the detail is amazing! Most reviewers in high end web sites have stated they couldn't see or hear the difference. I know I sure can!! The 4K version is at much higher bit rate (maxing out at 42mbps or higher!) whereas the two versions on the first edition are crammed (with some special features)onto disc one. First offering they should have put each version on separate discs to maximize the bit rate. This is not just a typical drama/comedy here. This is eye-candy deluxe! The wonderful looking sets look immaculate on the 4K version and looking less so on the first edition.
The sound seems to be amped up too in the surrounds on this 4K version. Disappointed they didn't take advantage and upgrade the soundtrack to 7.1 instead of typical Dolby True HD 5.1. The soundtrack is still only 48kz and not the higher 96/24 which would make it sound more alive and real. Hopefully with red ray 2160p in the horizon, Sony will up the ante on their so-so soundtracks.
It is sad that Sony makes us higher end fans double dip so soon with this new release. Why did they not just release this one mastered from 4K source in the first place? Hope all new releases will be from 4K source from Sony in the future.
If you are a fan of home theater, do yourself a favor and get this 4K version of Total Recall. Too bad its only the theatrical cut. But it sure looks and sound amazing.
By the way, this region free disc has NO special features whatsoever. Really shows off with the higher bit rate. But we get this version to show off our system anyway!
Crank it up!!

4753203,2,B005LAII3U,"Some review of this film that I read said various good things, various bad things, and ultimately concluded that the remake was ""unnecessary"".
Well, that's pretty much true of remakes in general, isn't it?  In Hollywood, you can't come up with anything new very often, or can't sell it anyway, so many of the movies are either standard genre productions, sequels (Rocky XXXX.....), or sometimes a remake.  For instance, ""Cape Fear"" with DeNiro was actually pretty good, perhaps better than the original in some ways, maybe not as good in others, but it wasn't really necessary.  Take those actors and that director, give them a good original script, and they could also have done a pretty good film.

Rarely does anyone make a remake of a film that didn't work the first time.  One case was the remake of ""The Shining""; the Jack Nicholas version was brilliant, a classic, or an over-the-top nightmare according to who you ask, and I guess somebody thought they could do better.  They were wrong.  You know what I'd like to see remade?  GWTW!  A modern take on those events would be very interesting.

The Scwarzenegger ""Total Recall"" was terrific.  It's pretty far from Philip Dick's story ""We can remember it for you wholesale"", but makes good use of the basic idea, and personally I think it's brilliant.  It's a lot of fun, and very watchable.  It's some kind of minor cult classic in any case.  Did these people think they could do better, or were they just cashing in by rehashing?  Well, the new  film is somewhat watchable, somewhat entertaining, has some good stuff in it, so that's why it's worth two stars.  The acting and direction are acceptable, the effects are pretty good, but it does go on way too long.  On the other hand, it has a lot wrong with it, which is what I want to talk about, and really it doesn't add anything.  I haven't seen the director's cut, but this version is already too long, so I wouldn't be very interested in dragging it out even more.

First of all, the ""worldwide use of chemical weapons"" has put ""living space at a premium"" and there are ""only two places left""-- Britain, and ""The Colony"", which is Australia.  Workers commute every day from Britain to Australia by this thing called the ""Fall"", which seems to be a giant skyscraper that travels through the earth, through the core, to get to the other side.  (btw, everyone in Britain and Australia seems to have an American accent for some reason.  All the main characters are white too, even more so than the original.  I remember at least there was that black taxi driver).
Where to start on the problems with this idea?  Well, it's cumbersome, far-fetched, unnecessary, ridiculous and stupid, but let's not focus on that.
There are a couple of technical points I want to bring up, though.

One, Britain and Australia are NOT directly opposite each other on the globe.  The antipodal point for Australia is in the North Atlantic.  The one for Britain is near Antarctica.  So the point is, a tunnel from one to the other would not go through the core.
Two, these commuters going to the Colony every day, assuming it is directly antipodal, are commuting 8000 miles one way.  At 1000 mph, the trip would take 8 hours, adding up to a 16 hour round-trip commute.  Might just as well live on the Fall, or live where you work, better yet.  In fact, the trip appears to take only a few minutes.  If you make it a one-hour trip, which gives you a fairly arduous but quite do-able two hours every day commuting, the thing must be going 8000 mph.  If you can go that fast, you can travel to other planets.
In fact, three, if you had the technology to build a subway straight through the planet, you could do all sort of things, such as, for example, a regular tunnel in which a high-speed train goes a long way at a high speed WITHOUT going through the molten core of the planet!  Or you could re-terraform the planet, or build  space colonies or huge underground cities, or anything besides this cockamamie idea.

Other than that, it's basically the same plot as the original Total Recall, except dragged out to the point of stupor.  And perhaps the biggest flaw is, you know absolutely nothing about the Colony, don't meet any of its inhabitants, so why should you care?  In the original, you met a lot of mutants, and they were interesting and sympathetic.  You don't want to see them die of anoxia.

There are a few touches that are maybe nice, such as the ""two weeks"" scene or the ""drop of sweat"" scene (or maybe they're not so great, maybe the original was better; in any case, they depend on you having seen the original.)  The three-breasted woman makes no sense at all without the other mutants.  In fact, if you just leave the plot the way it is, Mars, mutants and all, it makes much more sense and works much better.  There are also a lot of things that happen that, if you had time to notice, don't make sense-- why, when the hero is trying to take the Recall trip, do a dozen armed storm troopers instantly show up?  Why lots of little things like that?
Above all, why does this damned thing go on so long?

In the original, Sharon Stone was blond, and the other girlfriend was dark-haired, so you could tell them apart in the fight scene.  Here, the two of them are both dark-haired, look quite a bit alike, and they have MULTIPLE fight scenes; I could never tell which was which.  Not that I cared.  In the original, you could care about the mutants.  Free Mars!  But here, you don't know a damned thing about the Colony, or Britain either for that matter, and there's no reason to care.  It might make a good video game.  As a film, I can't see what it adds to the original.  In fact, the original is much, much better, and I'd stick with that.",1368662400,,5747,4.506769825918762
4753204,4,B005LAII3U,"I'm a fan of the Arnold version and I think this is different enough to warrant being considered on its own merits.  First, it's been a long time since I read the Phillip K. Dick story the movies are based on, so I can't comment on which movie is closer to the source material.

This movie has a different feel from the Arnold version.  The backdrop of the resistance and terrorist attacks makes it feel more contemporary and less of ""just"" a chase story.  The effects and city backdrops are excellent.  The acting is great.  I'm a fan of Colin Farrel and Brian Cranston - both do an excellent job, as does the guy who plays Farrel's friend (can't remember his name).  Having Colin's ex-wife (Kate Beckinsdale, also excellent) chasing him throughout the movie works pretty well.

Overall, this is a very different movie from the older Total Recall, though they share some basic elements.  Both are enjoyable for different reasons, but this shouldn't be tossed away as ""just a remake"" of the earlier film.  If you're a fan of dystopian sci-fi films you could do much worse than this.",1368576000,,1082,4.647368421052631
4753205,3,B005LAII3U,"I figured it was going to be hard to get away from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Verhooven-s-original-1990-Total-Recall/dp/B000IHL52W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Verhooven's original 1990 Total Recall</a>&nbsp;and its cheezy, over-the-top charm, with the mutant prostitutes, comical asphyxiating robot faces, Arnold's wacky dramatic vocalizations and that dramatic instant terraforming of Mars.  This remake, with its non-Martian, non-mutant storyline departed from the original immediately and effectively, with occasional fun nods to the original, a nice ""two weeks"" take being just one.

But unfortunately, in the end, literally, the ridiculous story devices and completely impossible physics ruined most of what it had going for it.  It's a fun diversion, but that's about it.

The visual world is very cool, with some outstanding CGI.  A lot of the future tech is very good, quite imaginative, like embedded communication devices that project interactive interfaces onto any glass surface and a police gadget that penetrates a room and disperses uplinked mini video cameras to a man-portable router/screen.  Cool stuff.

The maglev cars, featured in the Big Car Chase (BCC), just don't pass the common sense test.  Just like that horrible, horrible, audience-insulting device in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-1/dp/B000PMG16U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars: Episode 1</a>&nbsp;of fixing a submerged broken vehicle by tweaking a couple of wires in the center console, we get the same here, with the very nerve center of the sophisticated maglev car being right there in the center.  Awful.

The BCC is all mag-levy, and is cool enough, but then Hauser dirves off the grid, literally falls away and gets away.  Why can't the bad guys do the same?  He falls down, so can't they just see him?  Or fall down, too?  Where are the flying units?  There are no ground units?  Radios?  And his lady is out cold in the passenger seat, with gawking locals all around him, and yet he somehow manages to get her up and out of the vehicle and away and into his apartment without any noticing where he's going?  Awful.

In the end it's physics and logic that doom this film.  How is it that this ""Fall"" thingy passes through the Earth's core?  That's the diameter of the Earth, something like 7900 miles.  And in this movie the trip takes about 15 minutes.  Okay, kids, that's an average speed of . . . wait for it . . . 31,608 mph.  That's roughly Mach 45.  What kind of physical structure can travel at Mach 45, through a tunnel?  The physics of aerodynamics and atmospheric displacement make this impossible.  Imagine the heat generated by the air friction; the whole stupid thing would burst into flames at half that speed.  And then through the Earth's core, at 13,000 degrees F?  How is it the Earth's molten core doesn't just shoot out of the hole?  Wouldn't this make it difficult for our heroes to climb on the outside of the vehicle to escape the bad guys?

And if I were a clever little Resistance fighter, and apparently Bill Nighy's miniscule role of Matthias is a smart rebel, I'd note that the only real threat to my domain is the vehicle that comes up through the hole, so why not bomb or disable or otherwise plug up the hole?  Hauser manages to do that all by himself with a few nicely placed explosives in the space of less than 15 minutes--why can't the rebels toss a huge bomb down the hole, drop a car or a truck or a rock or a piano or a good ol' fashioned Acme(tm) anvil down the hole?  At a closing speed better than 30,000 mph, any of those would do some damage, at least enough to take away the threat that is the basis for the entire story.

And then there's the whole frantic elevator-shaft chase/fight thing.  As if people would design all of this without the slightest consideration of auto-stop systems in the event of obstructions in the pathways.  Awful, again.

I like Brian Cranston, more his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malcolm-in-the-Middle/dp/B00006G8J7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malcolm in the Middle</a>&nbsp;dad than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-Bad/dp/B0060MYKYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking Bad</a>&nbsp;methlord, so looked forward to this.  Cranston's got a lot to live up to in Ronny Cox's original Cohaagen, and he didn't get there.  The ridiculous big blond wig was the first indication; if you're going to guss up your character like that, then the character is going to have to be one seriously over the top bad guy (think Wez in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-Warrior/dp/B000KJZWMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road Warrior</a>).  But Cranston didn't make it, not even close.  Hauser is lauded throughout the film as the baddest of the badasses, yet when it comes down to the Big Final Fight, the two dudes mano-a-mano, somehow Cranston's over-coiffed bureaucrat is besting the ""greatest intelligence agent in the world?""  It was pathetic and ridiculous, a fight that ended completely predictably, but should have been over after the first swing.

And in the water?  Water, on the top of a vehicle that just traveled at more than 31,000 mph right through the Earth's core?  Wouldn't it be a bit hot for water?  And how did it even get there?  It's just another lame movie gimmick to make lame slo-mo action look more than it really is.

And am I the only who got a serious&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner/dp/B008M4MB8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner</a>&nbsp;vibe?  Farrell goes out to the balcony, cup in hand, just like Decker, to survey the nocturnal metropolis, only Colin is sans shirt and a lot more buff.  And the distinctly Asian feel in all of the street scenes, most of which are dark, and rainy, with Chinese and Japanese characters in neon in the background.  And a couple of times, I swear I was hearing what sounded like the ""Voight Kampf"" track from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vangelis-BR-soundtrack/dp/B009GEOR9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vangelis BR soundtrack</a>.  I guess it's imitative flattery, but it also comes across as unimaginative and derivative.

Bottom line: this is perfectly fine escapist fare, attractive actors in cool action bits, with a still-intriguing story line, enhanced by some imaginative tech and good CGI.  But fundamental flaws in physics and tried-n-true Hollywood gimmicks spin it into the dustbin of future history.",1368489600,,6698,5.645

 Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrel) just woke up from a terrible dream. Same dream, same time. In the dream he is a secret agent running with a woman (Jessica Biel). The police robots are after them. Quaid grabs a hold of her to stop her from going over the ledge. He then tells her she has to let go. The robot police capture him with a wrap around and pulls him back. Then he always wakes up.
  His wife, Lori (Kate Beckinsale), gets called in to her job after an explosion. Now Quaid has time to relax, watch the news and look out over the balcony of his home in Colony Rejoice. Later, after seeing an advertisement for REKALL, he boards the Fall transit to his factory job where he builds police robots.  Everyone has been told they will have to work a double shift. Quaid has been working so hard on the job. He has a dream of going on a vacation to Mars.
 With his wife passed out in bed, Douglas is so bored with life, he goes back out into the seedy part of the colony. He visits REKALL. The owner, McClane (John Cho), talks him into taking a mind trip as a secret agent. They put the necessary chemicals into his body when suddenly something goes wrong. McClane shouts ""He's a spy!"". The officers bust through the door and shoot everyone except for Quaid, who after shooting the officers is able to escape.
 He has no memory of being a spy, but this will be one night he will never forget.

Also in the cast: Will Yun Lee, Bill Nye, Bryan Cranston. Ethan Hawke is in the Extended Director's Version.

4753290,4,B005LAII3U,When I left the Cine I said I what copy of this. The Movie has little to do with the previous version or the TV series but like a old song by a different artist you still like it.,1368230400,,179,3.6153846153846154
4753291,5,B005LAII3U,I am a fan of the original as well and I like how they kept basic story... yet changed a few things in a unique way.  Watch it.,1368144000,,127,3.5357142857142856
4753292,2,B005LAII3U,decent enough movie but just not the same without big Arnold's over the top hero.  Love Colin but for me this version just didn't have the appeal of the first.,1368144000,,159,4.3
4753293,3,B005LAII3U,The movie is good for if you want to get out of your head for a while.  Lots of action and stays pretty close the the original storyline.,1368144000,,137,3.892857142857143
4753294,5,B005LAII3U,"A great movie remake. I loved the original Total Recall with Arnold. I couldn't wait when I heard they were going to make a new one. Although I did not get the chance to see the remake at the show,  I had to have it in my DVD collections once it was available. Great movie. Thanks Amazon for great products and prices.",1368144000,,318,4.129032258064516
4753295,5,B005LAII3U,"this movie is better the the other total reecall , sorry that how i feel cause i have watched this movie 2 or 3 times til i had to buy it on dvd. i love this movie it's worth it to me!!!",1367971200,,186,3.4523809523809526
4753296,4,B005LAII3U,Another remake of an old movie.  Did enjoy it and the plot twists were different than the original and the special affects are very good.,1367884800,,137,4.48
4753357,4,B005LAII3U,"It was nice to see someone who could actually talk and not grunt his way through the movie. Although the story line was the basically the same, it had some unique twists. Very enjoyable.",1367798400,,186,4.5
4753358,4,B005LAII3U,"good plot and story idea.

its a move worth watching.

taking off a star because the film lacked in some acting areas.",1367712000,,118,4.318181818181818
4753359,3,B005LAII3U,it was ok the original was much better al and all it was just ok would not have wanted to see in theater,1367539200,,104,3.5652173913043477
4753360,4,B005LAII3U,Good rewrite over the original movie with Schwarzennager starring.  This one was a little better and had a nice ending.,1367452800,,119,4.95
4753361,5,B005LAII3U,"I don't shop at Wal*Mart, so I was not aware the SteelBook was out there until I saw it used on Amazon.

I really enjoy watching this movie, especially the extended cut, for a few different reasons. I think this storyline is better than the original, with much more depth of character, alot less dorkiness, and just incredible sets and CG imagery. I have already watched it twice since receiving it, and I will definitely watch it many more times in the future.",1367020800,,461,4.554216867469879
4753362,5,B005LAII3U,"This version of the film is by far my favorite over the original.  The story has been altered but the intrigue and fast pace is awesome, as well as the special effects, the addition of two gorgeous costars and visually stunning.  Good sci-fi flick.",1366848000,,248,4.613636363636363
4753363,3,B005LAII3U,Its ok I was mistaken when I bought this movie but still like it. It has great special effects and good story line. I just liked the original movie with Arnold.,1366848000,,160,4.193548387096774
4753364,3,B005LAII3U,"Good ol' Arnold could get the audience to identify with his character more than Colin Farrell could. Also, dressing Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsdale so closely had a point? What was it??",1366848000,,187,4.875
4753365,3,B005LAII3U,"I haven't seen the original, but I my whole reason for buying this and viewing it, was because I wanted to see a fun sci-fi movie with stuff blowing up. I got exactly that. I ended up really enjoying the film.

The world really interested me, the special effects were spectacular, I loved the tone of the movie and how it kept changing from calmness to desperation and mysterious was great to me. The actors all did great playing their roles. Colin Farrell really impressed me as Quaid and I felt for the character. Kate Beckinsale felt pretty vicious and evil and Jessica Biel did great as a symphaetic character. The plot, although nothing special, really interested me and I felt the twists, although random, were appropreite.

Now on the flip side, dispite enjoying the movie there are some problems with it. One is character development is weak one example being Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel's relationship. There isn't much to it, it's just there. While I do feel sympatheic towards Biel sometimes her emotions feel bland, but I'm not totally complaining as I was still engaged to what was happening. The final fight is another one of those fights where it feels like the producers wanted to include one more just for kicks. Finally the twists are random and kind of confusing as to who was fooled and what was the purpose of Quaid in the first place.

So while I did enjoy it, the movie remains what I expected it to be... A sci-fi flick with lots blowing up and some one liners.",1366761600,,1488,4.607547169811321
4753366,5,B005LAII3U,A whole lot more action than the Original Total Recall even when they were pretty close to the original story.,1366761600,,110,4.55
4753417,3,B005LAII3U,"The movie was fast paced enough to keep me interested, but overall, it's not that great of a movie.  But, I never saw the original version of Total Recall, so I'm not a fan going into it.  Colin Farrell and Kate Beckinsale are both good actors in this movie, but Jessica Biel fell flat for me.  But, she usually does, in my opinion.  It's a good action movie if that's what you're looking for, but not a lot of substance there.",1366588800,,427,4.234567901234568
4753418,2,B005LAII3U,"I liked the original Total Recall better. Sometimes remakes are good. But, for me I just didn't care for this movie.",1366416000,,116,4.571428571428571
4753419,5,B005LAII3U,"I haven't seen a movie in a long time that I liked so much, and kept surprising as long as this one did. Interesting concepts & gadgets and just overall entertaining. Two thumbs up.",1366416000,,181,4.352941176470588
4753420,4,B005LAII3U,"Need I say more?
I liked this better than the original. The only problem was the constant use of the s-word. It was almost as if the writers were like, ""I don't know what they should say here. Just have them curse again."" - really unnecessary.
Other than that, this was a fun movie.",1366416000,,282,4.2407407407407405
4753421,5,B005LAII3U,"Exciting ,fast moving ,good acting and done in the Blade runner style like the original short story. On the new 46 in  ,fantastic  special effects.",1366416000,,147,4.84
4753422,3,B005LAII3U,"CG's were good, but story line is old and dated. Too much bang, bang shut'em up and not enough plot.",1366416000,,100,4.05
4753423,2,B005LAII3U,Thought I would like the movie because of the solid cast.  I was pretty let down. Acting wasn't anything special. And the whole premise of the movie was a bit screwy.,1366329600,,166,4.354838709677419
4753424,4,B005LAII3U,I loved the original Total Recall and this version in different ways! It was not a sequel but just the same concept expanded on and to bring new like for a new generation!,1366243200,,171,4.212121212121212
4753425,3,B005LAII3U,"This movie was loosely based on the original starring ""Ah-nold"". It was decent. Mostly though, this movie was steeped in CGI which is pretty much what sold the movie. The action sequences were pretty well thought out, but I'm really getting tired of seeing Kate Beckinsale's characters done up nearly the same in virtually every movie she's in lately. Give her some military fatigues with cargo pockets, a gun belt, and some body armor and I'll believe she's on the warpath just a bit more than her running around in a skin tight onesie with no pockets and nowhere to put a weapon. It is what it is. Hollywood is running out of ideas so it would seem.",1366243200,,651,4.52542372881356
4753426,1,B005LAII3U,"Not worth talking about the movie, I did not like, and that's it. I have to put 7 more words. Ok that is it!",1366243200,,108,3.5416666666666665
4753567,4,B005LAII3U,The story is different than what people are used to from the first film. Fans of the first will enjoy the little touches from the first. I thought the story was good. The actors did good & how can you go wrong with Biel & Beckinsdale?,1366156800,,234,4.108695652173913
4753568,4,B005LAII3U,"Sorry Governor, but this version was more compelling and gritty than the original.  I still like both, however.  If you like shooting and science fiction, then you will too.",1366156800,,173,4.931034482758621
4753569,4,B005LAII3U,"The movie was great, unfortunately, I was disappointed by how Amazon did not have a problem streaming a quarter of the movie in HD and then all of a sudden recalling that it can apparently no longer buffer in HD, thus streaming it in SD for the rest of the movie, and yet charging me for the HD price. Great business practice, I tell you!",1366156800,,338,4.2153846153846155
4753570,3,B005LAII3U,"I'm not sure how I feel about digitally downloading from amazon, this was a nightmare to get downloaded and extremely hard to access through my playstation and pc.",1365811200,,163,4.857142857142857
4753571,5,B005LAII3U,"The original is my all-time favorite movie and, since I know remakes are generally not as good as the original, I went into this with a completely open mind, no expectations, so to say this far exceeded my expectations would almost be silly!  Mostly, same basic storyline, with some updates...I was really impressed to say the least!  I can say this, in my opinion, was just as good as the first!",1365811200,,396,4.563380281690141
4753572,2,B005LAII3U,The movie was ok but not up to the quality of the orignal movie as far as  the acting and story goes.,1365638400,,101,3.590909090909091
4753573,4,B005LAII3U,"I have to admit the special effects was great

Schwarzenegger  should have had a small part  in that movie

another villain  would have been great ?",1365638400,,148,4.538461538461538
4753574,5,B005LAII3U,"Colin Farrell as great as usual. My open with all the action packed movie. I never saw the first one, so this was a good option to watch.",1365465600,,137,3.9285714285714284
4753575,3,B005LAII3U,Not as original as the original starring Arnold but the special effects are good and the story is engaging. Just not very original.,1365465600,,131,4.739130434782608
4753696,4,B005LAII3U,"I didn't buy this movie because it had won Academy Awards.  I bought it because it's got some pretty cool and fresh action scenes and because I liked the concept.  It was nothing like the original short story, which I read for the first time last night, but again, I bought it because it'll be good in the background while I'm writing.  Both Colin Farrell and Kate Beckingsale give forgettable performances, as does Jessica Biel - they are just pretty people running around a dystopian world trying to save it or keep it the same.  Colin has had better roles, and Kate simply needs to find a job as someone other than the hot, kick-ass chick in black.  In the end, the hero saves the day and gets the girl; well, one could say that except that all that happens as a result of his destruction of ""The Fall"", the device that transports cheap labor from Australia to Europe through the Earth's core, is that both the beautiful parts and the ugly parts of the world are left intact but are now isolated from one another.  So even at the end, the hero fails to improve anything at all other than to end the ""enslavement"" of the dregs of the world.  And yes, there's an underlying storyline that the evil overloards in Europe are rolling into the underbelly of society in Australia to kill off all the human waste, as it were, and replace them with robots, but all they really ever had to do was turn off The Fall, and that would have accomplished it.  So, none of it makes any sense at all.

Nevertheless, I ""like this"" because it's got great action, not because it's interesting or smart.",1365465600,,1584,4.43448275862069
4753697,1,B005LAII3U,"The movie was very poorly made, the plot was so unlike the original and was overall so lame that it effectively castrated the special effects.  And the acting was totally HORRIBLE!!!",1365379200,,182,4.870967741935484
4753698,5,B005LAII3U,"I found the movie interesting. A lot darker than the original, and more continuous action. But it was great they put in references to the original. The women were hot.",1365379200,,167,4.6
4753699,5,B005LAII3U,"Liked the original and was not disappointed with this remake.
Action and good story.  They did a great job... kept me entertained thru the whole movie",1365379200,,150,4.769230769230769
4753700,4,B005LAII3U,The action was here in this movie but I found the plot a little wanting.  Worth the rental but prepare to be underwhelmed.,1365379200,,122,4.304347826086956
4753701,5,B005LAII3U,just watched this movie loved it had to watch twice hope they make a part 2 hope thanks for the great price thanks for having it,1365379200,,128,3.9615384615384617
4753702,2,B005LAII3U,"After twenty years, it was probably inevitable that Hollywood would remake ""Total Recall.""  Sadly, the remake version of ""Total Recall"" isn't nearly as good as the original -- a giant chunk of the plot has been jettisoned (goodbye, Mars! Farewell, mutants!) and so has most of the humor and character development. Taken on its own merits, it's a decent enough sci-fi thriller, with some outstanding special effects and a solid (if underdeveloped) performance by Colin Farrell.

On impulse, Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) decides to go to Rekall, a company that implants false memories for entertainment. But things instantly go very wrong -- a SWAT team bursts in and kills the Rekall employees, and on instinct Quaid kills all of them. When he runs home in a blind panic, his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) also tries to kill him, and reveals that she isn't even really his wife.

Quaid goes on the run, with only a few cryptic messages and a mysterious safe-deposit box to guide him. But as Lori and the police chase him through the Colony (Australia) and the the United Federation of Britain, he meets a woman (Jessica Biel) who knows him from the past he can't remember -- and might help him bring about a new future.

Anyone expecting a straight remake of ""Total Recall"" will be disappointed -- no Mars, no Bennie, no Kuato, no mysterious terraforming engines, and a good chunk of the plot twists have been removed. Oh, and no mutants... well, except for the famous three-breasted woman, whose third breast is never explained because we never see another mutant of any kind.

No, this movie is grimly determined to be dark, gritty and ""realistic,"" depicting a  future where the world has been devastated into near-unlivability, and only Australia and a portion of Europe are still semi-normal. It's an intriguing idea, and it is handled in a fairly plausible way... well, except for the giant gravity elevator zipping through the Earth's mantle. That seems far-fetched.

Len Wiseman is at his best with the action scenes -- big explosive battles involving magnetic cars, killer robots and bombs, as well as a lot of people shooting at each other. And the future societies are intriguingly-depicted -- either they're grimy, murky cyberpunk mazes (think ""Blade Runner, but less pretty) or cold sterile technohaunts. In fact, the movie could really use some moments of humor or warmth, but neither ever appears.

Also... what is with the lens flare? Barely a scene goes by without a lens flare trying to blind me! Was Wiseman possessed by the spirit of JJ Abrams?

Colin Farrell gives a typically excellent performance as Doug Quaid/Carl Hauser -- he starts off as a nice ordinary guy, becomes a terrified, confused fugitive, and becomes stronger and more intense as he finds out about his past. But most of the other actors are playing roles that feel half-baked -- for instance, we don't know why Lori has such an obsessive hatred of her ""husband.""  Beckinsale, Biel and Bryan Cranston give decent performances, but Bill Nighy is clearly just phoning it in.

""Total Recall"" is a mixed bag of pluses and minuses. Those seeking explosive sci-fi action and a good Colin Farrell performance will love it, but don't expect much fidelity to the film it remakes.",1365206400,,3255,4.910746812386157
4753703,1,B005LAII3U,"Wished I had not bought it.

It was a non-stop action sequence.  Very lame.  Did not leive up to it's name sake.",1365120000,,112,4.0
4753704,5,B005LAII3U,"Though based upon the same short story by Phillip K. Dick, this 2012 version and the 1990 version starring Arnold Schwarzenegger are rather incomparable, even though every one does. The films have different cinematic qualities in every sense.

The earlier Schwarzenegger Total Recall was an entertaining hokey joke. Watching it again reminds that Paul Verhoeven tried too hard to cover too many bases in constructing a sci-fi action flick that can hardly take itself seriously. This jumble looks and feels dated, even as it retains its charms.

The Collin Ferrell version is a tightly-spun action thriller: Jason Bourne in the land of Blade Runner post-apocalypse. The cameo nods to the earlier version are a quaint touch, but this movie stands on its own as outstanding. The acting, cinematography and directing are all expertly done.

In time, the 2012 Total Recall is likely to be more highly considered than it is now. All the negative reviews read like built-in biases; not enjoying a movie on its own merits. Both versions are classic takes, albeit in very different ways.",1365120000,,1078,5.0790960451977405
4753705,4,B005LAII3U,"This film surprised me, in that I liked it so much.  Certainly well enough to buy it and see it some more.  It was just the same, only different from the original.  And they included nods to the original which pleased me very well.  A good evening's entertainment, especially if you throw in some popcorn.  With butter.",1365033600,,319,4.526315789473684
4753796,5,B005LAII3U,Very good for a remake. Finding a invading enemy seemed to be a problem. The remake only loosely followers the original. En eztra raid or two would of helped.,1365033600,,158,4.482758620689655
4753797,4,B005LAII3U,"First off this is not a remake of the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.  If you buy it thinking it is, you will be either very disappointed or very surprised.  It is a movie that has taken the basic premise of that movie, artificial memory implantation, and then constructed a very different story around it from what the original movie had.  That having been said, it's not a bad action flick.  Acting is professional - nothing super - but the action is good.  Take it for what it is and enjoy.",1364860800,,490,4.46067415730337

 Intense chase scenes in the new Total Recall are as good as the best Kung Fu Cinema, beautiful set design that pick up where Blade Runner, an over rated movie, left off! The best and most realistic looking version of the future I can remember seeing.

Kate Beckinsale is awesome as the Bad Guy boss and kicks ass! And Colin Farrell is perfectly cast in the role of the protagonist.

IMO as good as the last two Star Wars movies in every way.

4754003,1,B005LAII3U,"This disk has advertising (previews) in front of the movie that you cannot skip, and you can't go to the main menu. Furthermore (being a typical Sony disk) it has about 3x more FBI warnings and the like that you also can't skip, almost all of which in language you don't speak.  If you want to watch this movie, you should use Amazon instant video or a similar service, not the disk.

The actual movie is kinda of ""flat"". There is a lot of good action but it lost the connection with the viewer and feels disconnected.

There is a very serious problem here with acting. You can think about Kate Bekinsale what you want, her acting ability is very good compared to the standards of this movie.  The male lead has none, and that turns Kate Bekinsale's performance into a problem.  Jessica Biel does what she can, and I think she constantly improves, but she can't undo this mess between the two leads.  Kate Bekinsale's character is also a bit too furious given what the story looks like in the final edit, some of it is really not well explained, so she ends up looking overplayed.

They changed details of story development in this version of the story that have to count as dumbing down.

*POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*

Namely, there is a key scene where the bad guys want to convince the good guy he is in a dream. The way that he figures out the truth in this movie is a typically hollywood move to make it more emotional but makes no sense whatsoever as proof wrt dream or not.  Likewise, the final escape when everything seems lost seems to have lost logic bits in editing and it is unclear what is happening.

Don't laugh but I'm bothered by Kate Bekinsale's hair which is a huge mane in perfect shape at all times, no matter whether she's waking up or just had a gunfight. No fighter in the word would wear hair like that. Apart from never being able to see anything it's also way too easy to grab on to.  This is out of character for the furious flavor they gave this character here.

All things considered this movie looks like they edited with spoken text off. It's pretty, fast and loud but it deserved a bit more of the story.",1363737600,,2133,4.383248730964467

As with so many adaptations of Philip K. Dick's work, the film has only passing similarity to the original story, ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale."" This is OK in films like Blade Runner, but Total Recall is so different, it seems as if the title is simply a marketing ploy, losing not only the story but the themes of the story, which Blade Runner in all it manipulations of Dick's novel still carries through. And themes are the DNA of Dick's work. So when you cut out that DNA, you are left with something else entirely.

From here on, spoilers.

The idea of a path between through Earth's core between Australia and the UK is outlandish, and if it had been simply a ""nifty"" idea that did not have any real effect on the story other than to set a tone, it could have passed, but it becomes central to the story--exposing the absurdity. The seeming reason for this method of travel is that the rest of Earth is so toxic that normal travel along the Earth's crust is impossible. Of course, later, Douglas Quaid/Carl Hauser travels outside London to meet Matthias and only a gas mask is necessary. Even then, when the government troops show up and blast holes in the building, gas masks become optional.

Overall, the cityscapes are impressively done and the whole setting has a very Blade Runner feel. (You'll find a nod to Verhoeven's 1990 Total Recall in one brief scene.) The use of flaring light (I'm sure there's a name for the technique) gives the film a moody, futuristic feel.

The most troubling aspect of the film though is that it robs the story of what Dick so often focused on and what Verhoeven's Total Recall still managed to retain: is Quaid really a spy or is he living out the Total Recall experience? The story and Verhoeven's film leave that ambiguity in place. After a brief few minutes, the 2012 remake abandons any pretense of ambiguity and becomes a generic action film with a technological absurdity that I could not suspend disbelief. Avoid this film.

This movie at times had horrible acting, but at other times it was exceptionally well done and thought out. THe ladies sometimes don't fit in but hte whole plotline in general was brilliant. I thought it was inception with a twist. I would rate this film 5/5 because it's too low, and people are too harsh on this film in general.

I enjoyed the plotline, because there's a lot of parts where you are wondering if he's in the real world, what he's doing, and watching the whole movie is a brain twister. I was engaged in the whole movie. Perhaps this is why people hate the filmd. They just want to sit on their bums and watch a movie that has a lot of killing and a lot of cuss words as well as f-bombs. There may be a few in here, but not exactly what you are looking for. I would not say there's a whole lot of death in this film because it's pg-13. It's funny how the main head lady Lori Quaid, or Melinda keep fighting over the main character. It's intense although at times overly much.

I found that the film needs a second chance for a sequel perhaps with a little bit of more open ground, and hosting someone else besides the main character. Maybe he'll make a cameo, but the storyline should be around someone else like one of the secondary characters' or a Prequel.

I was hugely into science fiction as a teenager and I still love it, so I was very aware that nearly every scene in this film was derived from another SF film - it was a patchwork quilt in which the stitching was both obvious and fraying.  The main actors are all very pretty (Colin Farrell has never looked better, Kate Beckinsale is stunningly typecast and Jessica Biel earnestly smoulders), but they don't save this otherwise paltry re-make... unless you treat it as a trivial pursuit quiz to see who can identify the origin from which each scene was derived.",1362614400,,834,4.509933774834437

It was hard to watch at first without Arnold playing Douglas Quaid, but after a while I accepted Colin Farrell, as the main character. Not quiet as raunchy as the original, nor as much silliness.  This is a more serious version, which I feel stands well on its own merits. A bit more gritty , and realistic as compared to the original.  Overall this is a great movie to watch, or own.

4755103,3,B005LAII3U,"Being a big fan of the original Total Recall, I wasn't sure how I felt about them making an updated version, especially because the original is now on Blu-ray and looks amazing. I decided to check this out and see how it fared.

THE GOOD
The visuals in this movie are great. I really like the world they created, and the digital effects are very convincing. The set design, costumes and make-up are all first rate, and I have to give props to the designers for creating an imaginative and convincing future. The director also has an eye for interesting composition, and frames the movie well. This movie was fantastic to look at. Comparing this to other Blu-rays on the market, the clarity and fidelity are superb. The action sequences are pretty intense, so if you like lots of firefights and explosions, this shouldn't disappoint. The music and sound effects are fitting, and the audio quality is what you've come to expect from a Blu-ray disc. I don't have 5.1 surround, just stereo, so I can't comment on surround sound, but in stereo is sounded fine.

THE MEH
The acting is not bad. Nothing stood out, but there weren't any particularly bad actors that distracted from the film. I am a big fan of Breaking Bad, so I especially enjoyed seeing Bryan Cranston as the villain, but he wasn't given enough screen time to stretch is acting chops beyond, ""Hi, I'm the bad guy"". I have no opinion of Colin Farrell one way or the other, but in this movie he did a decent job. As the lead, he held his own, but just barely. Everyone else was forgettable.
Another area that could have used some work is the pacing. The film seems to be in 5th gear the whole time, and refuses to let up even at the end. The problem this creates is that it becomes a predictable pattern. Characters give a little bit of uninteresting exposition, then a 20 minute chase ensues, replete with gunfire and explosions, then they have a 2 minute breather with more exposition, then another 20 minute chase, then exposition, then chase, and so on. Without proper pacing, the ""big revelation"" of who Douglas Quaid really is, followed by another ""big revelation"", has no impact on the audience because the actors seem too exhausted from the last 20 minute chase to really give a darn.

THE BAD
This script is seriously lacking. There are no memorable lines, with the exception of lines borrowed from the 1990 film, and there's even a few scenes that makes small nods to the original film, which only serve to remind you of how much this version is lacking. There are three big problems with the script. First, it focuses way to heavily on the action sequences, and barely leaves room for story and character development. Second, the dialogue is really boring. Characters don't have anything particularly interesting to say, and don't have a clever or engaging way of saying it. I felt more like the characters were reading a synopsis off the back of the box rather than having natural conversations. Third, the story is too thin. This is really apparent when you compare it to the original. So much happened in that movie, so many twists and turns, so many interesting locations, so many characters, and they all seemed to have personality and purpose. The new Total Recall strips away the layers of depth from the original and all we're left with is a skeleton of a plot, a 2 hour movie with 6 minutes of story and 114 minutes of gunfire.
One final gripe, and this is more personal preference than anything else, but the characters seem invincible. Throughout the movie, dozens of trained police officers with semi-automatic weapons fire at the protagonists, miss every shot, then the protagonists will fire a couple shots and hit their mark flawlessly every time. Some of these police officers are robots, and even they miss. You'd think if they can build robots in the future, they could program some competent auto-aim software as well. It got pretty ridiculous in one scene where Quaid is surrounded by nearly 100 police officers in a building lobby, all of them aiming assault weapons at him and his partner. Logically the two protagonists surrender, since fleeing would be suicide. But then after a brief conversation, the two flee anyway and escape without a scratch. 100 cops, that have them completely surrounded and have been aiming at them for the last five minutes, are unable to hit two people standing in the middle of an open lobby in broad daylight!? WHAT?

OVERALL
If you like seeing special effects in High Definition, rent this movie. It looks pretty, but it's not very memorable. If you don't already own the 1990 original, go buy that one.",1362009600,,4627,4.701602959309494
4755104,4,B005LAII3U,"It's a good movie with incredibly good visual effects. The actors were good and acting was quite good as well. There is plenty of action, good story, it's not predictable but there is just still one problem with it that made me give it 4 out of 5 stars. The movie is not exciting. It is not boring, it's just okay. What I found quite cool, is the first scene where the main hero fights the authority squad. The angles for the camera were just great and it moved uniquely. The movie also has a three breasted woman like from original ''Total Recall'', however I did not find her as interesting as the original character. It just did not fit her. Not breasts, but the role, it wasn't for her. The movie is 2 hours long, has a big world to show us and generally very, very well done. I loved how they made robots and gave them life. The way they moved and acted, was just awesome to see. It's nothing like the original ''Total Recall'' and I can't say it's a remake. It possesses some elements from the original movie but also misses a lot of other elements. Therefore I can't consider it as a remake.

4755180,2,B005LAII3U,"Given this movie's pedigree, a potentially great cast on hand, and updated SFX, you figure, ""What could go wrong?"" The answer, of course, is nearly everything. Let's begin with this movie's biggest flaw; it doesn't know whether it wants to be a remake of Arnold's movie, or if it wants to take the original concept and make it it's own. On both accounts this movie fails as it fatally reworks key plot devices that made the original movie great. Nor does it really give much thought to the book's, ""Is this a dream or not?"" premise. The driving force behind this movie is action which is standard movie schlock for the most part. Only the car chase scene is remotely clever and that is disappointing; you'd think that given the opportunity to have Beckinsale and Beil fight, something better should have been produced for their scene if nothing else. Speaking of the star power, there is very little chemistry between any of the players. Cranston, for example, as the villainous Cohaagen was reminiscent of what happens to soda when you leave the cap off too long and Nighy's Matthias hardly figures into the plot at all. While this version of Total Recall does look slicker than Arnold's movie, that is no saving grace.

It's not (Arnold) Swarzenegger at all. And it's smart, I think, for the producers to realize that it could never have compared to him. As another Blade Runner, though, it works because the actor has as much uncertainty as the audience. Farrell discovers what has happened to him and it adds to the movie.

""filmed"" entirely in rainy nightscapes or indoors/underground until the final scene... stuff like that, I don't want to give it away too much. Just a nod to the original TR, and a couple of imaginative twists. There's tons of death via multiple bullets, yet no blood. Monchromatic computer cityscape and action. Lots of chase (running from baddies) scenes, not really that much hand-to-hand. The original Arnie film won't win any acting awards, but is INFINTELY more entertaining.

Farrell was adequate, nothing more. Unconvincing action and acting. Seemed lost and confused the whole time.

Jessica Biel was friggin' horrible. With the 80s teenage offset ponytail and constantly being saved from certain peril... sheesh. Dudley Dooright stuff.

I thought Kate Beckinsale stole the show. I've only seen her before in Van Helsing and the Underworld franchise and though yeah, whatever, Kate who? In Total Recall she delivered more intensity, believabilty, acting, kick-ass attitude, and... well, raw sex appeal. I had to look at the credits again because I was like ""wow, who is this actress?""

4756136,2,B005LAII3U,"'Total Recall' does have great (if confusing) CGI, interesting art work, and a competent hard working cast. In all other aspects, the film is a failure.

The 1990 version of 'Total Recall' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and directed by Paul Verhoeven and the 2012 version starrng Colin Farrell and directed by Len Wiseman both claim to be based on the Philip K. Dick short story 'We Can Remember it for You Wholesale'. Readers of Philip K. Dick will understand that the films are actually very  meagerly based on the original story. Of the two versions, the 1990 film tried to present the essense of Philip K. Dick's philosophy and thinking.  Verhoeven was interested in Philip K. Dick and used humor and absurdities to make the viewer question the reality of the story presented. He incorporated Dick's political views (libertarianism, anti-corporate culture, and the evils of big government) as well as Dick's metaphysical and religous views. He prompts the filmviewer to ask if Quaid's adventure is real or is it all imaginary as part of his altered memory? Did it actually happen or was it all an hallucination?

The nature of reality was a major theme in much of Philip K. Dick's works: What is reality? Verhoeven constructed his film to force the viewer to consider this question. Dick incorporated his personal drug-induced hallucinations into his stories and was even diagnosed as schizophrenic at one time. Verhoeven directed his film to include how Philip K. Dick saw the world. Verhoeven concluded his film without answering the big question of whether or not the story was real or imaginary. However he does indicate in the film's ending  that perhaps it does not really matter.

So on to the 2012 version.

The 2012 version does not even try to reflect the original intent of the short story or the 1990 film. It is a rewrite filled with intense action sequences, lots of CGI, and little plot. Philip K. Dick's literary imprint is all but gone although a case can be made that the dystopian background story was extracted from a number of other works by the author. We are given fast edits and  impossible fight scenes. The action scenes are so quickly cut that the viewer is confused about what is actually happening.  The background art that depicts a generally decaying urban cutlure is also so busy in interesting detail that it contributes to the distraction to what should be the center of attention - the story.  The two female leads, Jessica Biel and Kate Beckingsale, look so much alike, with similar hair style, hair color, body builld and form fitting black outfits, that is is difficult to tell them apart. And lastly, the use of constant CGI lens flare, as used in the Star Trek re-boot, is often inappropriate and distracts from what you see on the screen.

Perhaps the best piece of video on the entire DVD is one of the extras - Michio Kaku's featurette called 'Science Fiction vs Science Fact', which not only is fascinating by itself, but also give us a clue to understand why the film fails in the end. The film is not a Philip K. Dick exploration of reality but a vision of a dystopian science fiction future.

4756220,3,B005LAII3U,"I own this move because of the action scenes and they obviously spent a bunch of money on the film. With that said, I also own 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow.

The good : the technology is pretty cool. The Colin Ferrell does a good job. The story line was pretty thought out. Special effects were very good.

The bad : at times the plot seems glued together weakly. I definitely think the lead actress was way over done. I am cool with tough action women like Cameron from Terminator SCC or Alice from Resident Evil. Those are some of my favorite characters, but the tough woman in this movie was a little much for me. Some examples : when the rest of the police force is in full body armor, she walks into fire with none, apparently ""badder"" than every single other person there. She has biceps the size of my thumb but can apparently deliver punishing blows or out mussel a guy with fair sized arms. Like I said, Summer Glau, Milla Jovovich, Chalize Theron are some of my favorite action stars, but this character was a little over done for me.

The film also seems to drag on at times. I think it could have ended a little quicker than it did (or at least differently). The idea of a tunnel going through the middle of the earth and not being filled with lava makes no sense either.

ALL THEY DID WAS KILL THE ORIGINAL STORY AND CHARACTERS.......I ACTUALLY LOVE THE ORIGINAL AND DON'T JUDGE MOVIES BY IDIOT REVIEWERS AND BOX OFFICE RETURNS!

THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MIND SCREW STORIES IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM SO ADDING TO IT JUST SCREWS IT UP...WHICH THE WRITERS DID WELL HERE! THERE AREN'T MANY REMAKES I ENJOY. PUNISHER WAS ONE OF THE FEW. THOMAS CANE DID A GOOD JOB BUT MUST HAVE GROWN HARD UP FOR WORK WITH THAT SILLY HBO SHOW ""HUNG"". DOLPH WAS GREAT IN THE FIRST. STORY PREMISE WAS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. THE 2 HULK MOVIES WERE BOTH SUBPAR BUT THE SECOND WITH ED NORTON WAS WORSE IMO. I GUESS HE WAS SUCH A PUTZ THEY WENT WITH SOMEONE ELSE IN AVENGERS....WHICH KILLED THE HULK IN IT FOR ME.

BOTTOMLINE IF YOU LIKED ARNOLD AND THE ORIGINAL TOTAL RECALL THIS ONE WILL JUST BE A CONFUSING HEADACHE WITH EXPLOSIONS.

4756257,4,B005LAII3U,"Fans of the original ""Total Recall"" will have a very different take and the ability to compare.  I on the other hand, picked this up because a) I like Colin Farell on screen - he can be intense, fun, and cocky, b) I like the tech-period of this brand of scifi.  This production is almost the partner to Spielberg's ""Minority Report"": a ""in the near future"" kind of scifi, not the ""we're trying to blow your mind"" or ""this is totally out there"" kind of scifi.

The upsides of this movie are:
1) it keeps moving.  Not really much downtime.  The producers use quieter moments to pull their conceptual ""wows"" and their up moments for the action ""wows""
2) Visually diverse.  There are small venues, like clubs and apartments and then there are rooftop chases, mag-car chases, and some city-scape views.
3) Real scifi - although the headline concept is memory manipulation (the Rekall thing), there are other scifi aspects that are explored that relate to the plot.  The tech stuff pops pretty well (the phones, mag-cars, intra-planetary train, etc).

There are some downs for scifi fans - I will try to explain sans plot spoilers.
1) remember the rules of your scifi elements, they may dictate the plot predictably
2) hydraulic despotism is always predictable.  Let me define - hydraulic despotism is the control of everything through a single source.  Good example is the Phantom Menace/Independence Day plot holes: blow up the mother ship and all the babies die.
If you can identify a source of hydraulic despotism (by the way, a Frank Herbert concept from the original Dune), then you know that you know that you know that the writer intended for it to be key to the plot.

These two elements made the movie much less of a mystery than it could have been.

Final synopsis: fun movie, good era, relatable tech-level, good plot, average twists, not mind-blowing.
This was fun, but no nearly on the same page as the first Matrix or Inception.",1360540800,,1937,4.71513353115727

On the other end of the spectrum though was Kate Beckinsale, she sold her part so well that I all I could think of was that she was channeling a very personal bad relationship termination in her head the entire time.

The film seemed to be rushed from start to finish, I understand that it was an action movie, but but even a shoot-em-up needs something more than this.

4756847,3,B005LAII3U,"I was prepared to unleash venom upon this film. Total Recall(2012) is a solid movie. Director Len Wiseman crafts some decent action scenes and the CGI is top notch. He also adds references to Philip K. Dick's short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale and the 1990 version of Total Recall. This is the Total Recall movie that you can watch if you're babysitting.
Wiseman toned down the sex and violence, but there are plenty of ""S Bombs"". The Director's Cut adds more swearing and restores deleted footage. The only problem I have with the film is that it takes place in an anglophilic world where people can live only in England or Australia. I guess Africa, France, Norway, Sweden, Germany, the Czech Republic, the USA, Mexico, Brazil, China, Russia, South America, and other countries did not survive after World War III! The screenwriters leave out Mars and the mutants from this version. The fat woman with red hair and the call girl with three breasts do show up. Colin Farrell was quite good as Douglas Quaid/Hauser. Jessica Biel was very sexy as Melina. Lori and Richter have been combined into one character. Bryan Cranston from Malcolm in the Middle plays Cohaagen. John Cho is good as a Rekall guy who sells fake memories.

A lot of stuff packed into one vehicle!  You've seen the elements in other movies, Blade Runner, some of Hitchcock's spy or innocent man being chased and chasing after the McGuffin, other ""I don't know who I am or why they're chasing me but I know I am right and I will triumph by the end of this movie..."" movies.  This one has it all and a good mix.  Spectacular sets and scenery, with lots of fine detail for the HD camera and screen.

4757326,2,B005LAII3U,"Everyone who thought the 1990 version with Arnold didn't have enough action . . . this remake is for you.  The sane portion of humanity can safely pass on it.  The plot was not improved upon; in fact, it got much worse.  Someday, we will be able to travel to Mars, but we're never going to be able to build a subway through the center of the earth, because it is semi-molten and super hot, and may have an impenetrably hard metal core.

There is nothing whatsoever original in this movie; everything is borrowed from other, superior movies.  The atmospherics are borrowed from ""Blade Runner,"" the robot soldiers are borrowed from a bunch of other movies including star wars, etc.  The action is so grotesquely overdone, and goes on so long, it becomes pointless and boring.  There's a fight/chase scene that takes place on a system of vertical and horizontal elevator/people movers that looks more like a video game than anything that could be used to transport human beings.

The whole thing is just pointless, stupid, and boring.  I give it two stars because I realize it could have been worse:  I saw parts of the remake of ""Conan the Barbarian,"" and that was completely unwatchable.  Even though this is inferior to the original, and becomes boring, you never have to turn it off completely and watch something else (which was the case with the ""Conan"" remake).",1359244800,,1365,4.717299578059071

4757328,4,B005LAII3U,"I liked the original Total Recall movie starring ""Ah-nuld"" when I first saw it back in high school. It wasn't a great movie, but it was fun and had plenty of action and sci-fi goodness. I really didn't think it was due for a re-make, yet, and I really wasn't optimistic about the prospect of it being good. Why? Well, Colin Farrell isn't one of my favorite actors and re-makes are not often known to be much better than their predecessors. Still, it had my curiosity up and Redbox is so cheap it's hard to go wrong with a rental, so I gave it a try.

I'm happy to report that this movie was far better than I expected it to be. The acting was good, the action was superb, the storyline was neat (though completely far-fetched), and the production and special effects were some of the best I've ever seen. In fact, it was the fictional world that was created for the story that totally sold me on the movie. So much time and attention to detail were put into creating this fictional living, breathing, functional futuristic world that IT, alone, is enough to grab your attention. The high-tech concepts that were brought to life through the magic of cinematic special effects and computer animation were really incredible. No matter how implausible the concepts were, you can't help but have fun with the movie because they were produced with such high quality and professionalism.

Sci-Fi is always escapist in nature, and the production crew that brought this world to life deserve the utmost praise for how well they did their job. Much like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar/dp/B003EVWDR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar</a>, the visuals in the movie upstaged the quality of the storyline. Yes, there was action aplenty and it was all thrilling. Yes, there are two beautiful women set in opposing roles that are sure to get the attention of many guys. But in the end, it was the physical presence of the artifically created world that was the real star of the movie.

There are two countries left,the UFB(United federation of Britain) and the Colony(Australia).The UFB imports alot of its workforce from the Colony and they come and go daily by the ""Fall"".This huge cylindrical device carries thousands of passengers from one country to the other,through the middle of the Earth. Farrell lives with Beckinsale,and is stuck in a dead end job. He keeps having recurring dreams about being captured by police forces while a female accomplice escapes. One day he heads over to Rekall,a place where they can implant new memories of anything a client desires. Farrell picks being a secret agent. Just before they start the process they realize Farrell has already a secret agent implant and they stop it. Just then the police burst in and Farrell,acting on unknown instincts,takes the entire six man team out. Farrell escapes and returns home only to have Beckinsale turn against him and pursue him through the city,trying to kill him. It seems she was a police plant,pretending to be his wife and that he was at one time working for chancellor Cohagen.
The trick Farrell now has is to survive and find out exactly who he is and what they wanted of him. There are many trails for him to go through,but he eventually meets up with the woman from his dreams who is actually working for the resistance(Biel).Along the way Farrell finds equipment of his and his old apartment where the pieces start to come together. Farrell it seems was working for the chancellor initially but changed sides when he became aware of the chancellor's agenda to raze the Colony and build a new one. He was recaptured and re-programed by the chancellor but now that he has regained his memory he must try and stop the chancellor's plans from coming to fruition,with Biels help. He meets up with the resistance leader,but soon after the police arrive and take down the leader. Farrell and Biel are recaptured,with the chancellor ordering that Farrell's mind be wiped to its original self. Before they can do that Farrell escapes.
The chancellor now puts into motion his plans of a Colony conquest and sends thousands of troops onto the Fall. Farrell follows the chancellor and Biel onto it. During the transport's journey Farrell plants explosives and manages to rescue Biel. At the other end the clamps holding the machine in place explode one by one,until it free falls and breaks apart in a huge explosion. After it all Farrell is in an ambulance and he wakes up to find Biel there,but it is really Beckinsale in disguise. He dispatches her and the real Biel and he are reunited.
This new version of the film doesn't leave Earth,as did the first one to Mars. The strife is all here instead of on another planet. There are a few nods to the original as when Farrell says he had always wanted to go to Mars. There is also a check out through security onto the Fall,which mimics the security check when arriving on Mars in the original. It also has a woman checking ahead of a disguised Farrell. For those who recall the original,we are tricked into thinking that Farrell is really the woman,but it is a red herring. Overall I found I just could not get too involved with Farrell and company. There just wasn't enough oomph there,not enough spark to really pull me in. The acting that was tepid and couldn't ""believe"" enough for it to work for me. I also was wondering,plot wise,why did the Colony not blow up the Fall's entry point at their end in order to kybosh the chancellors invasion plans? Bottom line,sad to say,it couldn't ""convince"" me.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include about three featurettes,commentary and a gag reel.
All in all a disappointing remake of the original starring Colin Farrell. Farrell just does not have the acting chops to compete with Ahh-nold from the original,nor make us forget the original and focus on HIS efforts. Biel and others he spends most of his on screen time with,are also tepid. Beckinsale is the exception and Nighy does a good but short turn as the resistance leader,but it is all for naught.",1359072000,,5136,4.877574370709382
4757570,1,B005LAII3U,"I've been sick of our deluge of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels of goldie oldies for fifteen years and after trying to keep my eyes open in this horrendous mess, i left the theater and felt mad beause I wasted two hours of my life and paid $6.00 for doing so.

One of my major complaints is that flop-master Colin Farrel was cast in Ah-nuld's role. This actor seems to carry a bad luck curse in whatever movie he is in. He starred in another remake of a favorite, Fright Night. IT's flop was so disastrous it went to DVD in just a month or two after its theatrical debut.

In this one, he has one expression: a bug-eyed look that makes him look like he's in constant shock/surprise. Or, he resembles someone with the OMG expression of staring into a pair of headlights.

The rest of the movie is just a total hurricane of blasting sound effects, constant battles with the she monster. I'm trying to find out the name of the next movie Colin Ferrel will be in so I can be sure to avoid it.

I read that this botched remake cost nearly $100 million. I thought of all the young, movie-maker hopefuls out there brimming with new ideas that could result in a new movie franchise who could have taken just $1 million and given us something new and fresh.

Those days are gone when we could go to a movie theater and be thrilled with something fabulous like Alien, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Sadist, Psycho, Halloween.",1359072000,,1417,4.434615384615385

4757573,2,B005LAII3U,The setting for this sci-fi thriller was impossible to figure out.  Why would workers be commuting from Australia to Britain?

But I liked it - a lot. I mean, Colin Farrell is in the remake. Much better eye candy than Arnold. And for the men's enjoyment, Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale - both beautiful as always.

I liked the Asian lean of the Colony and the special effects were fun. The storyline was enough different that it wasn't a strict copy of the original but there was enough of the original framework that I wasn't totally lost.

It turned about to be the best movie I've watched all year. The reviews complained about the differences it had from the original and that Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Beil looked too similar. The movie may not be the same as the original, but it was still a very good movie and I don't know how people couldn't tell the difference between Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Beil.

It hits on all of the same plot points the old one had and both stories (is it real or not) could potentially be taking place.

Even if I had never seen the first film, this film was visually lacking, for starts. It might as well have been shot in black and white.

Though the script calls for a few too many three-story falls where he just gets up, dusts off, and keeps running and rain-of-bullets-but -none-ever-hit-good-guys scenes it's still engaging and suspenseful.

I like the modern update of the original movie. The movie has more of a Blade Runner feel this time and the digital enhanceents are very well done with a bit of an I-Robot feel. However the delivery of the actual playback leaft alot to be deisred. First off I was disappointed that the movie was not in HD and believe me that is never noticable as this movie has very compkex images that the streaming process was struggling with. I have watched other movies from Amazon with similar content and they were visually appealing.

I was a little disappointed because we had to stop watching the first night because about halfway through it would buffer about every 15 seconds.

We have crummy internet, but Netflix was working fine that night and I've had good luck watching Amazon movies before. So I think it was an Amazon problem.

We sat down to watch the second half of the movie the next night, and fortunately it let us watch 60 minutes of movie even though I only had 45 minutes left in my 24 hours. And we didn't get charged double.

I took away 1 star for my trouble. Fortunately we were available to watch the rest the next night. Otherwise I would have wasted my $4 bucks.

Both of these movies were adaptations of the story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Can-Remember-It-for-You-Wholesale-The-Collected-Stories-of-Philip-K-Dick-Vol-2/dp/0806512091/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Can Remember It for You Wholesale (The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick, Vol. 2)</a>). While I prefer the ""original"", this is a very watchable movie. Both Colin Farrel and Kate Beckinsale have good screen presence, and that adds a lot to the enjoyably.

No plot spoilers from me: The plot centers around Douglas Quaid, a factory worker that has an average life (but a surprisingly attractive wife), that dreams of adding some excitement to his mundane life. This is the future and the ability to implant ""memories"" has lead to adventure vacationing without the hassles of actually leaving town, so Quaid decided to visit ""Rekall"" for a little excitement. The action picks up right from there and it really doesn't stop all the way through. This does feel a bit like watching a video game, but it is very exciting. The special effects range from decent to excellent.

This is an enjoyable movie that includes many of the best elements from the first version and adds some unique twists to keep it interesting.

Recommended!

It was totally forgettable for me as it relies to much on CG and action scenes and contains too little in the way of story and character development.  This has become the Hollywood formula these days since they have pegged their audience as dull headed action freaks.  Fight scenes were way too long.  I had to apologize to my wife for picking this movie when it was over.,1358380800,,437,4.3580246913580245

Is this an exaggeration?  Not really.  There wasn't much of anything original in this film.  I've never seen the original Total Recall so I can't compare them.  But I can compare this film to others I've seen and it's basically a Bourne Identity wannabe rip-off set in an unconvincing and uncreative future.

Almost no imagination went into the portrayal of the future.  Robot cops that can't do anything reasonable, such as shoot their target successfully?  If I were to imagine martial robots, they would have TASERS built into them (why fight with *fists* when they can just taser somebody??) and they would be able to shoot any target with extreme accuracy.  Hell, they are robots... they should be able to do hundreds of things that humans can't... but not in this movie.  The robots depicted here were just as dumb and worthless as their human counterparts.  The humans even just handed these robots their ""futuristic"" guns which are exactly like today's guns, except they magically hold hundreds of rounds.

You know it's bad when the director just stops caring about common sense.  Go into the ""No Zone"" with nothing but a WWI gas mask?  Nerve agents (look up ""Sarin"" or ""VX"") and other chemical weapons will immediately begin to affect you just from skin contact.  But no hazmat suits here.  Apparently all you need is a loose fitting leather gas mask and you're good to go.

But at least the director threw in the obligatory shot of a touch-interactive refrigerator.  Didn't see that one coming!

I wanted to like this movie, but there was simply nothing to like.  Every clich imaginable was thrown together and that's about it.  It's a shame because when it comes to sci-fi and especially memory thrillers, the sky is the limit.  But there's nothing new here.  Just a bunch of BS.",1358294400,,1939,4.693452380952381

Farrell and Beckinsale are both good here, and this new TR is very well made. It fairly gleams visually, and moves well with good stunts and effects; overall it's worth seeing, but then I love PK Dick and think anything based on his ideas is worth considering.

Yet I always loved the cheese and humor of the Ahnold Recall, and this one plays it all too straight. Hardly any laughs at all, which somehow defuses the tension instead of the opposite. But if you haven't seen the original I'd say see this first and then watch the old one and see what you think.

The blu-ray is a good transfer and there are some decent extras, and Colin's commitment to the role is pretty clearly highlighted. He's the one who makes this work, when it does.

It's a nice slick sci-fi thriller, so if you like those you'll like this, and it's always fun to watch Cranston as a bad guy in any case. I think this version of TR will age pretty well, mainly because Farrell is such a likable lead in most everything he does. He gives it his all here, and it's that and his chemistry with the ever-beguiling Kate B that makes this a good recall.

So count me among the surprised to find that I actually enjoyed the remake that comes out this week on DVD as much as if not more than the original.

For those who don't know here's the story: The Earth is overrun with people and only two areas that are now able to support life, one in what we know of as England run by Cohaggen and another in what was once Australia. To get from one point to the other you board ""The Fall"", a skyscraper size ship that passes through a tunnel from one area to the other. The folks at the Aussie end are protesting their abuse at the hands of the others and use ""The Fall"" as a symbol of their life of servitude. Matthius (Bill Nighy) is their rebel leader, demanding a release by the people in the English area.

Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell) works in a factory that builds robot security troops for Cohaggen. He continues to have nightmares about a escaping the police with a woman he doesn't recognize (Jessica Biel). He wakes each night beside his wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale) unable to explain his dream other than to say it felt so real. Feeling as if something is missing in his life, he sees an ad for a company called Rekall.

Going to Rekall, Doug learns that it's a vacation that takes place in the brain. Rekall injects you with drugs and implants memories into your brain that make you feel as if you've experienced the travel dream of your choice, as long as you've never actually been involved in your choice in real life. Doug chooses the life of a spy but as he begins to go through the process the machines alerts the officials that he actually was a spy. Before he can argue the point the door burst in and a security team sweeps in killing the Rekall members and attempting to capture Doug. Except that his natural instincts kick in and he takes out the entire team and escapes.

Unaware of what is going on, Doug continues to try and escape the police and get home. Once there he is comforted by Lori who suddenly turns on him and tries to kill him. While they fight she lets him know this is not the happy home he though, that they were never married and that she was sent to watch him in case he remembered anything other than the implants the government placed in his brain. Doug escapes Lori and the chase is on. With little to go on and secretive clues that he apparently left himself, Doug is trying to find out first what is going on and second where he fits into the whole scheme of things.

So what makes this version different from the original? First off the amount of action involved. This film is an adrenaline rush from start to finish. At the same time it offers enough story to carry it along as well rather than opt for non-stop gunplay and running.  Most intriguing is the fact that you wonder till very near the end if this is all really happening or if it's all a part of the Rekall experience that Doug asked for. Is he really Doug or a double agent? And what about the girl in his dreams, where does she fit in to all of what is going on? If you've seen the original you know the answer, if not then you'll keep wondering until all is revealed.

Perhaps the biggest change from this movie to the original is the setting and motivation for the action being seen. It no longer takes place on Mars and doesn't revolve around generators that create an atmosphere there. Instead it sticks to this planet and problems between two areas that represent what is left of Earth. For me that didn't ruin the film at all. And perhaps that's why it didn't feel like so much of a complete remake and more like a re-imagining instead.

Ferrell does much better in this remake than last years FRIGHT NIGHT which missed completely. He does a great job as the confused Quaid. Beckinsale and Biel do tremendous as well moving from love interests to action stars in the blink of an eye. Having done so before my guess is both will continue to do so in the future and do it well.

It's been 20 years since the original film was released so I'm certain that there is a generation out there that's never seen that film who will enjoy this one on its own merits. Fans of the original, if they allow themselves to forget that film, will find this one entertaining as well. For me its one that I know I will have no problem pulling it out and watching again; it's that good.",1357776000,,4617,4.316032295271049

Dick's novel ""WE CAN REMEMBER FOR YOU WHOLESALE"" so it will have some of the scenes in the first movie. But not all of them and Colin Farrell is great as Carl Quaid not Dennis as was AS. And with 2 very strong women co stars this movie kicks! Kate Beckensale is great as Quaid's wife and agent sent to keep an eye on him. And boy does she turn on the preformance taking the place of Michael Ironside's character and Sharon Stone rolling it into one. Jessica Biel is great as Melina and she is just as great as Kate Beckinsale. There is no other world plot, instead it stays on earth and follows the novel a bit more than the original movie. Although I've only recently seen a few of Colin Farrel's movies he is very verstital as an actor whether he is playing a ruthless vampire, helpless sexually harassed assistant or an agent that has no memory of who he. Very few actors have the ability to take such a variety of roles and be believeable. In this case, Farrell is very believable and his training comes back to him subconciously to keep him ahead of his pursuers. The action begins almost immediately and continues at a faster pace than AS's movie. Like I said, it is not Arnold's movie so don't look for too many similiarites although some have to be there in order to keep it as close to the Novel's plot as possible, look at it as a very different movie and enjoy the ride!",1357776000,,1497,4.274647887323944

4759210,3,B005LAII3U,"I saw the original again not too long ago and noted how dated it seemed. Still it was a great movie. This one didn't need to be made as it didn't improve the idea, which either way isn't true to the PKD short story in any event. The Mars angle of the first was much more compelling than a wasteland Earth that has only two inhabited areas, Britain and Australia aka The Colony.

For some reason the chem warfare that devastated the rest of the planet spared those two locations (?), which can now only be reached via a through-the-center-of-the-earth hole (""keep digging Johnny, you'll hit China""). Flight is apparently RIGHT OUT for some unexplained reason. Also mystifying is the fact that a still chem-devastated area is only a short subway ride from unaffected downtown Britain, meaning weather has also been forestalled along with flight. But beyond those problems the worst part of the film is when the seventy-five year old leader of the Britain side kicks the crap out of our hero, twice. To keep the plot moving you see.

Still it was nice to see Kate as a villian. Collin played befuddled throughout.

Worth seeing for the $1.20 redbox price.",1357689600,,1152,4.693069306930693

Farrell does a very good job of selling the brainwashed and confused hero and makes you believe that he may never accept who he was. His action scenes are, well, really kickin' Add in Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale and, well, what can I say... you sold me! The CGI is first rate and the story though science fiction is remotely plausible. I did not think Beckinsale could be such a b-tch but she brings it in her fight scenes with her ""hubby"".

I give the new version credit for some very cool special effects, but that is the only improvement in this version.  The story has been changed, no longer focused on Mars, and there is now a much less interesting plot.  It falls far short of the original in this respect.  The main focus of this version is how many explosions and chases can be crammed into one movie, and does so at the expense of a decent storyline.  Also, it seems that the director is trying to give his wife, Kate Beckinsale, as much screen time as possible.  Her role as Lori Quaid is expanded so much that it loses the impact it had in the 1990 version.  Don't get me wrong, I like Kate Beckinsale just fine, but the change in this character is one of the many changes that do nothing to improve the movie.  Regarding which format of the movie to buy, don't waste your money on the Blu-ray if your reason for purchasing it is to see the alternate ending.

It deviates from the Arnold version sufficiently to provide a visual feast and engaging story but does pay homage to the original. The presentation's picture quality is excellent accompanied by a stellar audio presentation in Dolby True HD. Dialog was clear, gunshots (and there a lot of them) quite discrete and whizzed by my ears in surround glory.
As much as I enjoyed the Arnold version I prefer this version due to the more contemporary story and of course stellar visual effects. Arnold's version does win on the classic one liners though; Colin Farrel delivers several but they're lost in the intensity of the action scenes. Overall definitely worth at least a rental and highly recommended but awarded 4 stars as it's a remake.

If you absolutely HAVE to guarantee that a movie that almost certainly should have been a box office smash instead be yet another bomb......hire Colin Farrell as the lead actor. Talk about box office poison!! Why on earth do people keep hiring this guy? He is a passable actor, looks ok.....just something about the guy guarantees that whatever he is in loses more money than anyone could ever imagine!
Incredible....I can't really figure it out. Yes, the movie was a very poor remake but still, it should have at LEAST broken even at the box office just from viewer curiosity over a remake of Arnolds GREAT original version....but true to form....Colin does it again. Colin Farrell truly is a ""one of a kind"" actor the likes of which I have never seen before!
The guy must have sex tapes hidden away featuring every movie companies CEO and their mistress.....how he keeps working in the film industry is a mystery beyond comprehension. When on earth are the financers of films going to realize that Farrell ALWAYS guarantees a vast loss of money?? The guy should be driving a taxi, not acting...anything but acting!!
The movie itself is poorly done, listlessly acted, poorly shot....just an incredibly lame remake of a truly great movie. Not even worth a cheap rental!",1357257600,,1300,4.834080717488789

The new one also had the same symptoms at about the same point in the movie but they were easier to clear.  The only other disc I had trouble with on this machine was the BluRay Tarja Act One which I later learned gave trouble to almost everyone.  Is anyone else having trouble with this Total Recall BD?

UH-OH!!  I just read my own review of Prometheus Blu-Ray. It had problems too. My 400 disc BD Sony carousel machine only has a few months of use since I bought it refurbished at a Sony outlet.

Like Arnie's movie, it's based on the short story ""We can remember it for you wholesale"" but the overall problem is that it's a remake and other than the fact that this version isn't based on - or connect to - Mars, it's very predictable. Both leading women are pretty, Colin ain't ugly and you can mostly believe in their characters. Unfortunately, if you have also seen I Robot.... you can't tell where the book begins and other Science Fiction movies end. Also felt like Minority Report was another favorite of the director.

I was left wanting to know more about the world this movie was taking place in. That is also a fault, as the history of what happened and why certain things were they way they were were never given. Viewers are given a shoehorned exposition at the beginning and left with that. Without spoiling anything, the main transportation device was ridiculous and tainted my viewing of the movie to start.

What really made this movie fail in my eyes was it trying to be Total Recall. They could have used many of the same plot devices and story-line, rewritten slightly, and ended up with a better movie. I think it's ""reboot"" legacy got in its way. Some of the wink wink nudge nudge moments they tossed in for the fans of the original were so blatant that they came off as insulting.

There are some cool ideas and some good special effects in this movie. I don't regret seeing it, but go in with tempered enthusiasm, especially if you loved the original (even with all it's cheesiness).",1357257600,,1103,4.5376884422110555

Great special effects, fine action sequences, good acting (considering the script diaglogue).  But what were the script writers thinking?  First, the gimmicky plot change to eliminate Mars was senseless--as was the high speed ""train"" tunnel through the earth's core.  The role of the main female antagonist was typically uni-dimensional and ultimately boring.  The amazing fighting skills of the leader of the ""bad guys"" was a pretty flimsy plot device and served no purpose but to provide yet another fight scene.  I kept waiting for the shared hand scars gimmick to be woven into the plot--and wasn't disappointed (but not especially thrilled).  Also, many things were left unresolved (e.g., was our hero really a bad guy before his memory was wiped?  If so, why did they bother to wipe his memory?  Why did I bother to even care?).

The cast doesn't measure up to the original - nor does the environment. Mars made the original a real sci-fi film whereas this could take place anywhere on Earth. Here, this could be any one of a hundred different films and you couldn't tell the difference. Sure the effects are better than the original but not enough to win an Oscar like the original did. It's sad to see how easily entertained people have become in the last 20 years. Farrell doesn't have anywhere near Arnold's presence, who was surprisingly good in the first one.

4760579,2,B005LAII3U,"Too many movies today go long on action and short on storyline and characterization.  This 2012 remake of the original ""Total Recall"" is a good example of this.  There is so much action in this flick that the viewer rarely has time to catch his or her breath and reflect on what the story is trying to tell us, i.e. what is reality and who, really, is our protagonist.  The original version is not exactly short on action but it does give the viewer a chance to reflect on what is going on.

The film also takes idiotic liberties with the original Phillip K. Dick (""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"") short story upon which this film is (supposedly) based.  In the original story and original film the protagonist had a yearning to go to Mars.  Here, there is no Mars; just some ambiguous political setup between something called ""The United Federation of Britain"" and ""the Colony.""  My son's reaction summed it up pretty well: ""who cares?""  I get it that the makers of this film felt a need to differentiate it from the original version.  In my opinion this change to the storyline was a distinct failure.

The characterizations in this film left plenty to be desired as well.  The actresses are all skinny, dirty, good-looking (did I say skinny?) women who look so much the same that I had trouble telling them apart. Evidently in the future they will not be taking showers or even washing their hands.  There is no chemistry between anyone.  By the last 30 minutes I was more than ready for this film to end, which it (mercifully) finally did.

This is a remake that should never have been made.  My son and I watched this New Year's Day and we both agreed that our time would have been better spent watching the original version.  RJB.",1357171200,,1743,4.520766773162939

I especially liked the set that was made in the style of Blade Runner. That was a nice homage to that set designer and gave the move a very familiar feel, but that set was not the only backdrop .  The stroy is told a little bit like a tale of two cities.  A beatutful shining city of the corrupt establishment and the colony of rebels. The colony set was done in the Blade Runner style.

The elevated highway with the maglev car chase scene was really well done.

I'm not a big Colin Farrell fan, but he played his part well. Kate Beckinsale also turned in a very strong performance as the top cop out to get Farrell.  Her performance was intense and very believable and made the movie better.

In the first movie there seemed to be two stories, the fight for better living conditions by the people against a corperation and the cover up by the coreration.  The new versions plot is more about this man who is trying to find out who he was and the story is just swept under the carpet as something that just happens.

The first thing I noticed is that the setting puts the film's story in the same world, essentially, as ""Blade Runner"", and could have been happening in the same city at the same time. This really sets the tone, which is quite a bit more involving than the campier 80s version. Kate Beckinsale's character has a lot more to do in this rendition that Sharon Stone did in the same role. I watched it again right after I saw it, just to make sure that my opinion was correct; It is.

The original Total Recall I thought did a better job at this, as you were always questioning who Quaid truly was, a spy for the rebels, a spy for the corporations, or some schmuck sitting in a chair dreaming this. This remake teased and made a few references to it, but I think lacked the immersiveness in the theme I would have liked. Quaid in the remake seemed to come to grips much to fast with who he was and what the ""truth"" was.

I did like the references to original movie and I don't think the removal of Mars from the plot hurt it. It was a good pace, and Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale were fabulous in thier roles (Kate a little more so than Jessica).

Colin Farrel did a good job in his role, though I would have liked to see more range between who he was before Recall and who he was after. Arnold did a great job with this in the original. The video of him talking to his future self shows different linguistics and even a ""happier"" Arnold. Colin didn't quite pull that off here.

First off, this is a HIGH 3-pointerif Amazon had a 9- or 10-point system Id have given it a 7.  Its a good remake of the original, but doesnt score high in any category but one (ish): special effects.  (More about them later.)

My philosophy is the same for music covers as movie retreads: if you're going to remake a classic, do something new with it.  Re-interpret it...make it distinctly your own.  And when it comes to movies, add an angle no ones thought of.  Give the hero or bad guy different motives.  Set it in a different era.  Whatever: make it your own.  Why else remake it?

But other than update the effects, Total Recall really refuses to go its own way.  In fact, Id be more prone to knock a film that does so little to win a new audience, but as Total Recall pretty much lives or dies with its effects, this one thing has to be enough...and that is a possibility, especially if you haven't seen the original.  Lets face it: if you're reading this review, its probably the biggest reason you're thinking of seeing this movie anyway.

So lets talk about those effects.  If you're as old as me then youll remember how the original movie was noteworthy for the technical ground it broke. In fact, the Oscars honored it with a Special Achievement Award for Best Visual Effects in 1990..a recognition that it was THE film of the year in that categoryno other film was even nominated.  Here, though, as accomplished as these effects are, they don't deserve THAT kind of recognition.

A large part of the originals success was due to director Paul Verhoeven, who equally instilled Robocop and Starship Troopers with savvy and clever FX.  He had a way of using technology as a plot device, furthering the story rather than merely outfitting it in order to fill space and time.  For instance, the continual use of newscasts and advertisements in those movies imbued them with clever commentaries on the societies in which they were set.

Here, the effects are certainly eye-opening, but only occasionally did they come close to the eye-popping Gee Whiz! of the original.  There is a scene in which their hovercars vertical control is switched off in order to release them from the flow of traffic, and the drop sequence is pretty stunning...especially the moment they regain control.  You can see the scene in the trailer: the cars beneath them are crushed by contact with the cars airjets--not by the car itself.  In this scene, the FX create an intelligent surprise.

Additionally, elevators fling their characters about, not only vertically, but sideways as wellall at top speed (I'd hate to be drinking coffee in this future.).  A nice touch was also supplied by the confusion the effects gave the characters themselves, as in a couple of scenes where 3D holography convinced Quaid that this or that was real when indeed it was no more than a projection...for HIM.

So, yes, the effects are dazzling at times, but I felt they had the quality that mars a lot of CGI in movies--that is, it OVERDOES the technology.  If youve seen anything in the last decade, from Star Wars to The Mummy to the Matrix to John Carterscenes are composed of MILLIONS of characters or other gewgaws that crowd the frame in order to overwhelm the audience.  Yet what is gained through gimmickry is ultimately lost through the audiences overstimulation.

For instance, the scenes outside their ""neighborhood"" are quite obviously meant to depict a society with out of control growth, with living quarter heaped on living quarter in a dismal, wet, overcrowded borough that, despite its technology, was still basically a slum.  But it's SO full of buildings and lights and stores and wires and vehicles and rain and sidewalks and canopies and people that it's impossible to take in.  Similarly, the very interesting scenes in the transport hubs are also beautifully visualized, but there is so much to take in that I couldn't really tell where characters were coming from or where they were heading.  There was just too much to see.

In terms of acting, Colin Farrell is okayhes athletic enough and does a great job acting confused (it IS required of this role, at least).  In this category all he has to do is beat Schwarzenegger thespian skills--but oddly enough, The Arnold was perfect for a role like this.  He was certainly strong enough to fight off enemies, and his goofy comic book face and voice seemed to be the right fit for an over-the-top movie like ""Recall.""

Farrell is likable and good looking, but I didn't think he was a great asset to the film. Still, he's at least the kind of guy who might be married to or pursued by Kate Beckinsale and/or Jessica Biel, so give his face credit there.  And there are some good supporting cast membersincluding Bryan Cranstonbut many are gone before you even notice them.  This was a sore point for me: Bill Nighy, for one, was wastedblink, and hes gone.

And in this regard I return to the point I made about retreads: the plot really didn't go anywhere new.  Granted, some of this is expectedI mean, youd have felt cheated if the three-breasted woman didn't make an appearance, wouldnt you?and the airport security scene is kind of repeated, as well as a couple of others that I wasn't disappointed to see made it back, but one thing the original version had going for it was that the labyrinthine plot kept you guessing: just who IS Douglas Quaid?  Who are these ""friends"" who seem to want to help him and, perhaps even more important, who are his enemies?  I felt the original did this a little better than the remakeor maybe thats simply because I knew the plot already.  But see?  The new one should make a little more effort to CHANGE things and keep us guessing.

This didnt.

But ""Recall"" is still fun to watch, especially if this is your first time around.  Maybe a little less TOTAL recall would have helped.",1356912000,,5887,4.6819066147859925

4761350,3,B005LAII3U,"Total Recall 2012 is a better film than I was expecting but doesn't really add anything to the original to justify the remake. They've tried to update the story line and in the process lost much of what worked the first time around.

There are numerous nods to the Arnie classic which make no sense if you haven't seen the original (the triply-endowed woman is thrown in for no reason whatsoever). They combine the characters of Quaid's wife and Richter, which is a real shame, and lose all references to Mars and mutants so this is a really sanitized rethink that looks more like a sequel to iRobot. Kuato is missing, Johnny Cab is long gone and strangely the glitching mask scene is handled really badly compared with the first time around.

The special effects are good and the production design owes a huge debt to Blade Runner's Asian influences. I was impressed with how the fight sequences use the vertical space in the sets which was exciting to see despite some over the top camera moves. Kate Beckinsdale isn't really a good replacement for Michael Ironside and Colin Farrell can't really compare to the uber persona of early 90s Arnie.

This remake wasn't the cataclysm I expected but by replacing the campy mutants and inter-planetary intrigue with bland CG and robot soldiers, it feels very neutral and sedated. The original was the last great rubber effects film - it's a shame they didn't pay homage with some great animatronics rather than giving the three-breasted girl five seconds of screen time.",1356912000,,1515,4.796934865900383

4761458,2,B005LAII3U,"There are a few things I really enjoyed about this film.  I liked how it was fast-paced.  There were some solid action sequences and well choreographed fight scenes.  I think Colin Farrell was an okay cast.  I even enjoyed the set design in this film.  The first half of the film was even very enjoyable, but after that, this turned into a Michael Bay-style film.

I could make several comparisons between this film and The Island.  This felt like the same kind of style; the pacing, action, and characters were almost parallel.  Colin Farrell's performance was good, but almost every negative thing about the film made it hard for me to care what happened to his character. Another issue I had was the redundant action scenes.  Chase scene after chase scene...they were all the same, nothing to set one apart from the other.

I can get over that stuff.  What I cannot get over is more of a technical issue: the lens flares.  I noticed tons of lens flares in the trailer, which meant I knew I'd see even more in the film.  Not only does this look tacky, it is cliche and unnecessary...not only in this film, but in the majority of other films that utilize this effect.  It became annoying and distracting and I found myself mentally deducting stars from this film just based on that reason.  That's how bad it was.

In conclusion, Total Recall is a watchable Sci-Fi film that is unnecessary but mildly enjoyable because of how fast of a watch it is.  Fast-paced action, although repetitive, makes for an easy, thoughtless viewing.  No need for a second pass.",1356912000,,1558,4.624087591240876

Don't get me wrong, the movie was fun to watch but about the level of Equilibrium. The world they created was just too antiquated for movies of this caliber. There was too much Cold War context for my taste in it. I watched it twice on separate days and it was a nice, casual movie to watch. It's the kind where you walk away, return, and don't feel that you missed much.

4761572,3,B005LAII3U,"Perhaps adding a little reference to Shakespeare adds a bit of dignity to this exercise in special effects wrapping Philip K. Dick's little short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"". As entertainment this film works well for those who like clever constructs of apocalyptic destruction and robotic culture and the idea behind Dicks story is fascinating to a point. But to make this noisy jumble of fighting and falling and tension last over two hours is begging indulgence.

The summary with the product tells it well enough: `Welcome to Rekall, the company that can turn your dreams into real memories. For a factory worker named Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), even though he's got a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) who he loves, the mind-trip sounds like the perfect vacation from his frustrating life - real memories of life as a super-spy might be just what he needs. But when the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man. Finding himself on the run from the police - controlled by Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston), the leader of the free world - Quaid teams up with a rebel fighter (Jessica Biel) to find the head of the underground resistance (Bill Nighy) and stop Cohaagen. The line between fantasy and reality gets blurred and the fate of his world hangs in the balance as Quaid discovers his true identity, his true love, and his true fate.

There is some fine dialogue that gives the film an uplift: Matthias (Bill Nighy) `It is each man's quest to find out who he truly is but the answer to that lies in the present, not in the past. As it is for all of us.' Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell) 'But the past tells us who we've become.' Matthias: The past is a construct of the mind. It blinds us. It fools us into believing it. But the heart wants to live in the present, look there. You'll find your answer.' The actors cope with this concept well - Collin Farrell is more buff than ever and handles his impossible role well, and Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Bryan Cranston, Bokeem Woodbine, and Bill Nighy (in a momentary role) all offer interesting moments.

If you love sci-fi and clever visual tricks then this is a film for you. If story is more important to you, then pass.  Grady Harp, December 12",1356825600,,2240,4.663291139240506

Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin
Directed by: Paul Verhoven
Runtime: 1 hour 54 minutes
Release Date: 06/01/1990

I was dubious of any attempt to remake the old classic.  It's hard to top Schwarzenegger in an action role, after all.  But this one did it well.  They updated the story line and actually made it a little less far-fetched which makes the plot more accessible.  I was relieved that the modern, computer graphics did not become the star of the movie which all too often happens today.  Not that it isn't entertaining but this story had some human soul to it and that would have been lost.

All in all it's a grand attempt and well done.  I enjoyed it although I still love the original, utterly far-fetched story line of the original.

I've seen better special effects, graphics, and acting in video games.

The original wasn't a masterpiece, but I wouldn't be upset to watch it again.

This one?

With that said I was expecting an enjoyable sci-fi action flick, and that is what I received. The special effects were really great except for a little too much lens flaring going on. I thought Kate Beckinsale did a terrific job as a badass in this movie ( they should consider her for a Tomb Raider ) I also thought Colin did a good job, not great but good.
I really enjoyed this movie for what it is, just a fun sci-fi ride and you shouldn't go into this movie comparing it or you'll probably like it much less.",1356739200,,599,4.217391304347826

4761772,2,B005LAII3U,"I was a huge fan of the origianl film, and I had hoped this adaptation would be a similiar experience, and perhaps better since special effects have come so far since 1990. This movie had lots of star power, a huge budget, a promising director, and really great source material by which I mean the 1966 Philip K. Dick short story. With so much going for it I really have no idea where this film went wrong. Starts outs good. It's certainly a nice looking film, great art direction, and good, tight photography.
 Say what you want about the original film, some hate it, some love it, but it was a ride. When it ended you felt like you had been on a larger than life adventure. With this film I felt as if I had been promised a ride, but then got lost in a long line waiting for the ride to start, sure I saw the roller coaster go by several times, but I never had a chance to get on. Arnold Schwarzenegger may not be the greatest actor, but he lends himself well to the part of the vehicle character in the 1990 version of this film. Colin Farrel, who is a great actor, plays a character who is a little chuckle headed. He is extremely bored and discontented with his life so he goes to Total Rekall where they attempt to implant fake memories of him being a special agent. After Farrel finds himself deeply emerged in this special agent fantasy he is unwilling to commit to it. When I put myself in his shoes I feel as if I would think either A. I'm a secret agent and a lot of people are counting on me so I need to stop whining and man up, or B. This is all part of the fake vacation which I paid for so I should stop whining and simply go for it.
By the end of the film the ""Plot"" was rather convoluted, and, as Michael Bay has proven in practically all of his films, extra explosions can't make up for bad writing.",1356739200,,1818,4.121126760563381
4761773,2,B005LAII3U,"I'm not a fan of remakes and this is a prime example.  The movie is very well made but they would have been better suited giving it a different name rather than trying to piggyback on the original.

It didn't come across as Houser fighting for the Resistance against a man who had led to the opression of half a society of people.  It came across as Houser trying to stop a current invasion from happening.

Personally it was OK....clearly the special effects were awesome but some of the acting left a bit to be desired.  The characters and their relationships were not explored at all.....there was much more to these folks int he first movie.

This film had the advantage of huge advances in technology that lends itself to this kind of si-fi action. The female actors were not any better than the originals, both were excellent, but Colin Farrell played the part better, and I thought that the background changes to the plot and keeping it on earth made it more believable. I thought I would miss Mars, but there was so much going on I did not have time. I thought shutting down a synthetic robot army was more believable than starting up an ancient alien artifact.

4762073,2,B005LAII3U,"I saw the original TOTAL RECALL as a kid so I was eager to check out the remake. I went into it with the most open of minds and with no attachment to the original. If you're the kind've person that likes great special effects and that trumps a good solid story this movie might be for you. Unfortunately I'm not one of those guys. I really enjoy a good story and a well thought out script. With so much ""action"" and s*** blowing up every 5 seconds, I gotta be honest: the movie was kind've boring (at least to me).

To keep this short: here are my pros and cons of the film.:

Pros:
- Interesting concept (a tunnel through the Earth, from England all the way through the Earth's core to Australia)

- Special effects are amazing. Really out of this world (which is why I gave the film 2 stars)

(I'm not trying to be a cock, there really aren't any other pros)

Cons:
- Generic acting. I don't think it's Colin Farrell or Jessica Biel's fault. In fact, I each of their performances in the movie were truthful. However the story and the characters they were given to play were GENERIC AT BEST, BORING AT WORST.

- Slow story. It just dragged on and on.

- S***ty Writing. There was nothing in this movie that stood out. I was completely uninteristed and uninvolved in the characters success or failure. If anything the special effects were more of a distraction towards an already boring movie.

I would pass on this one.",1356566400,,1420,4.3522727272727275

The effects were certainly better, but there is no drama, tension, or interest in this movie that's any more sophisticated than a flying car chase (that looks just like ""Minority Report"") or a gun battle in a city that looks copied from ""Bladerunner.""

The technology ""gimmick"" that stands in for the Martian isolation of the first film is an interesting idea - that's barely explored, probably because logistically it doesn't actually make any sense. There's also literally no plot element in this film that stands in for the big set piece at the end of the original movie (the reactor and blue skies on Mars). Blowing up an over-glorified elevator? Who cares?

This is an extremely poor paint-by-the-numbers no-brain action film for Colin Farrell. I think I was actually more entertained by ""SWAT,"" and I'd prefer to watch ""In Bruges"" dozens of times in a row rather than having to sit through this for a single additional viewing.",1356566400,,1008,4.888888888888889

This movie is packed to the brim with action and wonderful CGI. I was completely blown away and mesmerized by this movie and to be truthful I really don't understand ask the bad reviews. Maybe a majority of the negative reviews are from fanboys of the original and have the mentality of how dare you remake this movie, and them are the type of people who are going to hate this movie no matter what, which is really sad. So if you are a fanboy of the original and you have the mindset that this movie sucks right from the get go, without even giving it a chance then do yourself a favor and don't watch it, but if you are someone that love tons of action, a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you thinking, then this is the perfect movie for you.

Well, at least the ones who have 5.1/7.1 surround and actually care about the audio part of the film.

It can be solved by changing to PCM (or just play the DVD on TV speakers), but when someone spends a lot on the audio part of a movie, he/she deserves what the package promises.  I don't know how blu-ray.com gave the audio glowing reports.

I'm sure someone will castigate me for giving one star based on a technical problem.  Would anyone enjoy a trip of some distance in which every now and then the car feels like it went into a ditch with high sides and jarred your teeth?  It would ruin the trip, in my opinion, and it was impossible for me to enjoy this film with the sound ""dumbed-down"" or leaving the speakers altogether all through the film.

4762477,3,B005LAII3U,"While the film was somewhat enjoyable, they really blew it by changing the script so much.  Instead of Mars and control of oxygen, we have earth partially destroyed through chemical warfare with workers traveling between Great Britain and Australia through the center of the earth in just 17 minutes.  Passing through the earth's core made for some interesting gravity shifting effects in the film which played a role in combat.  Overall, I was dissatisfied with the story line.  I also was disappointed with a PG-13 rating allowing for a brief nude view of a triple breasted woman.  My teenage daughters groaned and yelled at me for allowing that to slip through to their viewing displeasure.  They expect me to protect them from stuff like that, but how could I know that PG-13 now allows full frontal nudity of women's breasts like that?  PG-13 use to be safe in that regard.  And why was it even in there?  In the original, which was rated R, they had the issue of mutations and the triple breasted woman was one of many mutated people in the film.  In this version, nothing was developed about mutations and it was completely out of place for the new story.  In the end, this film is nothing more than a rehash of an interesting science fiction film of the past, but changed significantly for the worse without adding anything better than what the original had.",1356480000,,1366,4.697478991596639

4762665,2,B005LAII3U,"This refresh of the original ""Total Recall"" outdoes its predecessor in special effects and overall appearance but fails to compete in character, story, humor and memorable dialogue lines (""I've got five kids to feed""). It starts out with a lot of promise in the first quarter of the picture and then spirals downward which is a shame as it started with some potential. It's a dry husk of a movie lacking soul once you get past the special effects.

Tale follows a time in which the Earth has polluted itself from warfare in the latter 21st century with England and Australia being the only suitable territories left for human beings. Enter the main character played by Colin Farrel who is a blue collar worker who discovers his entire brain has been reprogrammed and that's a secret agent for the ""good guys"".

Also starring Jessica Biel, Kate Beckinsale and Bryan Cranston.

The budget for this film was $125M and it made over at $198M the Box Office.
Rotten Tomatoes gave it roughly 30% positive.

Based on a 1966 short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" by Philip K. Dick

4762812,3,B005LAII3U,"I would have given this product 4 stars, but the audio went out of sync with the video after the audio dropped out for a split second more than once.  I've got about 200 BD's, and I've never had that issue before.  I'm not alone with this problem as I just did a quick search on the Web and discovered others are having sync problems too, and it seems to be happening on a variety of players.  (I'm using a PS3 Slim.) I was able to get the audio back in sync with the video by re-starting a chapter.  Others said they did it by switching from Dolby TrueHD to PCM.  Consumers shouldn't have to find a fix to this problem because Sony Pictures shouldn't have released a product with this issue.  Shame on them.  They need to do the right thing and issue a TOTAL RECALL of this disc and send consumers a corrected replacement... like Universal did a few years back with the ""Jurassic Park"" DVD's.

As for the film itself, I really like this film for what it is: a fun popcorn movie with outstanding visual effects and great (but somewhat flawed) surround sound.  Aside from the sync issue, the soundtrack is what you'd expect from an action/sci-fi/popcorn film: loud with lots of explosions and gunfire.  Thankfully, the rear surround channels aren't forgotten or under used as there's plenty of sound coming from them throughout the film.  The visual effects are jaw-dropping at times.  You know a lot of it is CG but most of the time it looks pretty darn convincing.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's nominated for an Oscar for its visual effects.  (If only this movie had been filmed in 3D.  It certainly looks like it was meant to be.  I hope we can look forward to a Blu-ray 3D release with an upgraded soundtrack to 7.1 channels down the road some day.)

Not being a fan of the original film, I found this ""Total Recall"" to be a big improvement.  I know some feel exactly the opposite, and that's ok.  To each his own.  Personally, I'm not a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting in general (unless he's playing a cyborg), and I didn't care for the cheesy jokes sprinkled throughout the original film (lines like ""consider dat a divorce"").  And even back in the day, I thought some of the visual effects were really bad (like when Arnold's character, the woman and the bad guy are all exposed to the Martian atmosphere and their eyes bulge out of their heads).  That's not to say the new film is perfect.  It's not a deep movie, but it's highly entertaining eye candy, and it features a few cool ideas for future technology, such as a cell phone in the palm of your hand (literally) and turning any piece of glass into a computer screen with just the touch of your hand.  I don't know how plausible they are, but they're interesting nonetheless.  I think the Extended Version is the better film as it fills in some blanks.  It's a shame the extra footage wasn't seen in theaters, and it's a shame the director over did it with lens flare.  It's out of control in this movie! But Colin Farrell is a much better actor than Schwarzenegger, and I don't think Kate Beckinsale ever looked hotter than she does in this movie.  She also proves she can play a good villain.

This disc set comes with the usual extras you find nowadays (behind-the-scenes documentaries, flubs, etc.) as well as a UV copy.  I give the film itself: 4 out 5 stars; the video presentation: 5 Stars; the audio presentation: 4 out of 5 stars (would have been 5 if not for the dropouts and sync problems).",1356393600,,3473,4.458003169572108

Then the writers cut some of the layers in the identity crisis Quad/Houser is facing in such a way that it makes you believe they have no understanding of the PK Dick Story.

The highly detailed special effects are phenomenal and seamless, creating a very believable future dystopia. The acting is great - Farrell pulled this off very well, lending an appropriate sense of gravitas to one whose reality was upended. Sexy Beckinsale and Biel are gorgeous and I love their elevator fight scene. The sophisticated plot only enhanced the killer action scenes.  Recall is in effect a chase flick with great twists. It's exciting and should be seen on the biggest screen you can find.

4763084,4,B005LAII3U,"In many ways, this adaptation of ""We Can Remember It For You, Wholesale"" is superior to the '80s version with Arnold.  That version (of course) is still fun to watch, and has a lot of sci-fi, comedy, and action.  This one is more sci-fi, with some political drama (nothing aimed at real-life politics, thank God...) and a good amount of action, too.  There is not a lot of comedy, though there are some nods at the previous movie which made me smile (no need for me to list them here; you'll recognize them easily enough).

The acting was good, the special effects excellent, and the plot is okay.  I say okay because one of the main characters has clear motivations, but we are not privy to them.  For the whole movie, I could not tell why they were doing those things.  C'est la vie.  Also, after the movie is resolved, if you have half a brain, you will sit there, thinking, ""Wait...  They still have the problem of..."" and it is not even hinted that there is so much as a plan to fix anything.  Then again, this is not that story.  It's the story of Colin Farrell's character, and it's a pretty good story, too!

Last point, and I'm trying to keep this spoiler-free.  Some people are questioning whether the events in the movie actually happen, or if they are all just an implanted memory.  Here is the (spoiler=free) answer: they happened.  If the movie were only implanted memories, we would not get to see conversations that happen far away from him, and yet, we see plenty of those.  Many scenes do not have Farrell anywhere near them, nor watching them, nor listening in.  Thus, they cannot be said to be just memories implanted in him.  End of discussion.  :-)

Unfortunately it is totally devoid of the reality twisting that makes PKD so fascinating.
While the plot-line is fairly close to the original movie in most respects, it has one big flaw
in that there is no question of the reality of the action.

Gone are all the hints from the first film that what we are watching is a paranoid fantasy.
For that reason, the one scene where it is brought up falls pretty flat and uninteresting
and plays out clearly as an attempt to trick him rather then the actual appeal to sanity
it was in the original movie.

4763211,2,B005LAII3U,"The good:

The special effects are top notch; however, in this era, any high-budget movie has excellent visual effects, and they are no longer a reason to watch in and of themselves.

The bad:

Colin Ferrel can simply not carry a movie; he has failed to do so before, and he fails to do so again. When Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting in the same role is of better quality, you know something has gone horribly wrong. Ferrel is flat, and simply not believable in the role of Douglas Quaid.

The neutral:

Movie makers have always recycled material from their predecessors, so the current wave of ""reboots"" is certainly nothing new. However, in the case of Total Recall, none of the logical reasons for a remake exists. The original is still a movie that does not feel completely dated and is fun to watch. The original audience of the Schwarzenegger version is still very much alive and kicking, and not letting enough time pass between the two versions puts a great deal of pressure on the remake to be much better than its earlier counterpart. It was 43 years between the first two versions of King Kong and 29 more years before the third version showed up. While 22 years may seem like a long time between Total Recall incarnations, the rate at which movie technology has moved during those two decades is much, much slower than at any time before, resulting in a complete lack of wow-factor in the new version.

Verdict:

Colin Ferrel's acting is absolutely horrid, and is a significant factor in the movie's failure. The rest of the film is not so horrible, but it stills ends up falling on the low end of mediocrity. The end result? A surprisingly boring experience not just when compared to the original, but even as a standalone work.",1356220800,,1740,4.648208469055374

The lack of low oxygen Mars mutants changes the feel of the entire story. I know the newer version of Total Recall wants to be different, but I missed the traitor Benny ( with his ""five kids to feed""), the mutant's hero resistance leader, Kuato & the alien technology that can terraform a planet and produce oxygen) which leaves a lot to be desired in Colin's movie. There are a lot of action and fight scenes to keep you entertained. I like the robot Federal Police however, not sure why the robot cops seem off line all the time.

Comparisons to the Arnie version make the same mistake as with True Grit - neither are remakes but adaptations on the same original novel/short-story. Philip K Dick, who's amazing imagination sparked so many sic-fi movies, wrote this tale, this is a movie adaptation of it. THIS adaptation is closer to P.K.D's story than the previous version. It borrows from other movies but does so obviously in a respectful homage kind of way: we have Blade Runner (also Philip K. Dick), we have Fifth Element and we have I Robot - the overall feel gets it right with a more 1984 Orwellian feel. Oppression is the correct feel, and we get it here, but not in the Arnie over sanitized, over-acted version. And who said Colin Farrell is no Arnie? i hope not - good for his time but Arnie isn't like anyone except a pro-wrestler or bodybuilder - spies, commandoes, special forces guys - none of them look like over preened gym rats. Farrell does an excellent, low key job. Plus one of the core messages, about who we really are, that Mr. K Dick likes to weave in, isn't lost in this version.

The movie is action packed. It is really one big chase scene. It did not disappoint as an action movie.

However, also as an Arnold fan and a fan of the original movie I have to compare. This movie replaced the Mars plot with a kind of dying earth where only the UK and Australia are inhabitable and an elevator connects them through the planet core. Kind of dumb.

But Farrell pulls it out and puts emotion, physique and believability to his character who we root and care for. Unlike the original drone-like actor who really depended on the set to move the movie Farrell plows through the set and pulls an otherwise sinkable script off the ground and gets us to care and believe in the world we see.

4763634,2,B005LAII3U,"Having been a fan of the original, I was unsure about being able to view this objectively. However, the setting is different enough from the original that if you've seen the classic, you won't get too caught up in waiting for your favorite lines or scenes. For me, this version misses the mark on certain levels. It's more interested in being a CGI/action flick than an interesting story. There's no dramatic payoff for any of the characters here. There are tense/anxious moments, but those are driven more by the action than informed by any internal conflicts the characters have (although Kate Beckinsale does walk around looking stern for most of the movie). And for me, losing the Mars storyline removes the sci-fi heart of the story. This story has no heart. It tries to be post-apocalyptic in some weird sense, where there's a lot of scenes that look more like they belong to an updated Blade Runner than Total Recall. It does try to be a good action thriller, but just having great CGI effects and some good action scenes doesn't make a movie. Maybe for some people it does, but it doesn't work for me.

4763754,3,B005LAII3U,"""Total Recall"" is a remake of the 1990 sci-fi film that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Because of its success, Hollywood decided to dust it off, reboot it, make a few changes, and present it as a summer action alternative to ""The Dark Knight Rises.""

Based on the Philip K. Dick novel ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale,"" the current ""Total Recall"" is set in a future world comprised of two superstates, the United Federation of Britain and The Colony.  The Colony's inhabitants must travel from their bleak, overcrowded neighborhoods to their factory jobs in the wealthy Federation via the Earth's only remaining means of long-distance travel -- the Fall, a huge elevator/tram that drops through the core of the Earth and deposits its passengers on the other side. The entire journey takes a mere 17 minutes, far better than a daily commute across the GW Bridge in 2012.

Because life is dull, a company called Rekall offers to provide customers with vivid memories of pleasurable experiences. Colony-dweller Doug Quaid (Colin Farrell), dreaming of a more exciting and glamorous life, ignores the warnings of a co-worker and visits Rekall, where he pays for a chemical implant that will give him an artificially induced memory of an exciting past. In the midst of the treatment, however, all hell breaks loose when armed robot police break in and start shooting the place up.  Miraculously, and for reasons unknown to him, Doug manages to destroy a pile of these deadly adversaries in breakneck time.  How can he do this?  Where did he learn the skills?  Is this reality?  A memory?  A combination?

So goes the rest of the movie, an above-average action flick with more than its share of twists and turns.  As you watch, you'll notice borrowings from other sci-fi films. The sunless, rain-soaked landscapes are right out of ""Blade Runner;"" the white-clad robot police are clones of the ""Star Wars"" stormtroopers; a gravity-less sequence is reminiscent of the hotel corridor sequence in ""Inception;"" images of the Colony's occupier, Cohagen (Brian Cranston), appear on giant screens everywhere, in clear homage to ""1984;"" and the daily drudgery of the workers comes right from Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis.""

Farrell plays Quaid as a nondescript Everyman. Farrell's cinematic stature does not yet match that of brighter lights Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford, and that helps us accept Doug as the poor schlub next door who gets himself into a pretty complicated fix.  Hitchcock never did science fiction, but he'd likely enjoy the plot -- an innocent gets involved in an immensely sticky lethal mess and must work his way out of it. The story draws us in and holds us, and director Len Wiseman keeps the pace brisk and lively with enough action for two pictures.

The standout performance in ""Total Recall"" is from Kate Beckinsale as Doug's wife, who has an agenda all her own. The role has many intriguing facets, which will not be revealed here.  Ms. Beckinsale does so much running, fighting, chasing, and shooting that she resembles a computer-generated video game avatar, but gets to convey enough human emotion to keep her character reasonably grounded.

The dialogue in Kurt Wimmer and Mark Bomback's script is frequently pedestrian and ordinary.  The 1990 version had humor, even campiness tossed in, making it a unique experience.  The present ""Total Recall"" takes itself far more seriously, with tremendous effort (and money) devoted to elaborate action sequences.  When it comes to an award for cleverness or sparkle, the scriptwriters might as well stay home.

The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos is striking.  The Fall, in particular, is impressive and includes lots of interesting details that make such a contraption plausible. The intercutting of live action and real sets with the CGI imagery is smooth, and when the computer-generated shots are shown, there is always a slightly panning camera movement to make them appear more authentic.

Rated PG-13 for violence and language, ""Total Recall"" is a journey of the mind set in a futuristic time.  When compared with other sci-fi movies, it doesn't rank with the best.  As an action film, however, it offers a two-hour thrill ride.

Bonus extras on the two-disc Blu-ray edition include several behind-the-scenes featurettes, digital copy, and gag reel.  There are also single-disc and three-disc Blu-ray editions. The latter contains all the extras on the two-disc edition as well as a DVD version.",1355961600,,4469,5.094650205761317
4763755,2,B005LAII3U,"I really wanted to like this movie, having felt somewhat guilty for not seeing it in the movie theatre, I figured at the very least it would be fully worth it at home. My negative feelings towards the film have nothing to do with me loving the original and making scene by scene comparisons. But if you are going to 'remake' or 'reboot' and then say you are being more faithful to the original story - - then this is a bad example of that approach because the movie seems hell bent on nodding at the original every chance it gets. There are several instances of scenes and dialogue from the original film and it always came off as a cheap carbon copy.

This movie is visually cool, from the designs of the vehicles and environments to the cinematography and well staged action sequences. But it has no soul, no heart. The whole conflict is hinged on the idea of an invasion of what's left of the colony in which they never made me give a damn why that was bad. The powers that be seemed to control everything anyway so what was the big deal about bum rushing a little more territory? This was the biggest problem with the film, I just did not care about what was at stake and I didn't for one second by the relationship between Quaid and Jessica Biel.

The second biggest failure of this film is that it did not improve over anything from the original. Every choice they made that was different wasn't better in the way of a more dramatic result.

If you want to watch a slick looking sci fi film with a lot of action, then this is for you. If you want to watch a slick sci fi with a lot of action and a good STORY, go watch the original, or even Bladerunner.",1355961600,7,1659,4.243670886075949

4763758,4,B005LAII3U,"I only heard bad things about this re-imagining of Total Recall and I was quite hesitant to buy it, however due to the fact that the new God of War demo came with this I blind bought it and was pleasantly surprised.

First thing, this is not the same story as the original Total Recall and really the story is a little lacking. The main focus is the visual special effects and the intense action and stunts.

The PQ is very good, the only downside is the style and filter used for the bright lights streak across the screen, sort of like the trademark of director J.J. Abrams. It is very distracting and I almost thought something was wrong with my TV. The audio is Dolby TrueHD and for the most part it is nice and clean and crisp. It seemed to lack depth and dimension at times with the loud action scenes and gun fire, however over-all it sounds better than most and it was consistent throughout. The dialog was a little cheesy at times, but over-all wrapped up a fun movie.

It could have used a little more humor and a slightly better story build up and character development, but for the most part Total Recall is hugely entertaining and a visual masterpiece.

Very much deserves multiple viewings and a great action sci-fi popcorn flick.",1355961600,,1244,4.466960352422907

4763760,5,B005LAII3U,"Being a big fan of the original Total Recall, I was skeptical at best when hearing about this remake.  I was worried that they were going to stray too far from the path of the original.  However, I was also really excited about it because it looked like it was going to be good...with some great action & special affects, and the cast overall caught my fancy.  I thought maybe there was someone better they could have maybe cast instead of Colin Farrell for the role, but he was actually pretty good.

My dad and I were going to go and see this in the theater together because we both enjoy science fiction movies but in the end we never were successful in making it out to catch it.  I had heard good things from a couple of people I know and read enough good reviews here on Amazon so I wound up just buying it on Blu-Ray after it came out, and I wound up scoring a free demo of the upcoming God of War Ascension with it for my Ps3 as well, so that was pretty cool.

I was told by someone when going into the movie not to compare it too closely to the original but instead just enjoy the movie for what it is.  It is very much the same as far as concept and it follows the same kind of idea & storyline, but at the same time it's very much it's own movie, and brilliantly so too.  The acting is well done, the action & special affects were outstanding, and movie is just all around a great sci-fi action film!

I do not wish to say too much about the plot, the only thing I will say is that it takes place on a post nuclear Earth as opposed to on Mars and there's no alien type stuff or anything.  If you have seen the original film the plot is very similar though in many ways(there's even homage to the 3 boobed chick in it) but I will say this for all of you...don't compare it too closely to the original though.  While it follows the same plot and concept, it does stray to it's own means with a lot of it.  Try to just have an open mind though and enjoy the movie for what it is...a very stylish, updated, thrilling reimagining.  For all sci-fi lovers that have never actually seen the original, definitely see this movie.  I would recommend checking out the original too...just be forewarned of a few cheesy 80s type bits in it but it's an overall worthwhile experience too.",1355961600,,2283,4.159090909090909

4763932,3,B005LAII3U,"Lets just go down the list. The acting was mediocre at best. The best acting came from Jessica Biel and unfortunately with a decent cast of actors I was expecting more. The storyline was terrible. Just a hint to the writers, if you want to do a remake that has the same name as the original, you have two options do a total overhaul making the new movie barely discernible from the original or simply remake the original with only slight alterations. This movie is neither. It is a terrible mix of of about 75 percent original movie line and 25 percent new. Unfortunately the 25 percent new made the movie worse than the original. I was sorry I payed for the rental of this movie after watching.
The caliber of script and production/direction combined would have made for a great science fiction channel original movie made for tv. If launched that way I would probably give four stars.

4763937,2,B005LAII3U,"Not really sure what the point of this remake was.  Put it more firmly in the ""Blade Runner"" universe. A lot of the set design worked toward that end, but a lot didn't, too. There's lots of rain, squalor, ethnic mixing, and neon, but none of BR's brooding noir romance.  Plus there's the whole weird ""Minority Report"" maglev highway scene ripoff.  And the robots (which they call ""synthetics"" just as in BR) all look like they're out of Will Smith's ""I, Robot"".  It winds up being a confused mishmash of styles and ideas, with none of PKD's overarching intellectual dread. Colin's not too convincing in the role of a vulnerable hero.

I'm not saying it's better or worse than the original film. It's different, and maybe worth seeing of you're a PKD completist. I am saying it lacks any kind of authorial vision or direction, and it falls down on that, a LOT.  Yeah, maybe action movies don't need that kind of integrity, maybe they're just supposed to be fun, but this isn't all that great as an action movie either.  PKD didn't write for action, he wrote nightmares of the constructed self, and this movie misses that target. It doesn't even seem to aim for it, which begs the question of why bother adapting a PKD story at all?",1355961600,5,1230,4.5636363636363635

4763939,3,B005LAII3U,"Fond memories of Paul Verhoeven's ""Total Recall"" kept coming back while watching this remake. Arnold Schwarzenegger's screen presence was also an added plus in the 1990 film, as well as the one-liners, Mars and of course heaps of bloody violence. If you've seen the original, then you know how it goes.

Len Wiseman's remake of the same name replaces Arnold with Colin Farrell, in his first lead action role in years, while eliminating Mars as the backdrop of the action and replacing it with an overpopulated Earth where transportation from one corner to another occurs, literally, straight through the center of the earth. The rugged subterranean mazes of the red planet is replaced with dizzying skyscrapers and lots of sleek, flying cars, not unlike Philip K. Dick's own ""Blade Runner"" and ""Minority Report"".

Farrell can act and is definitely a strong action lead and it shows here, as per the beautiful ladies Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel who both show off brawn over beauty here. Alas, everything is taken way too seriously in this version. I have fonder memories of the Verhoeven/Arnold version where one-liners come post-Arnie-kill. Gone. Certain characters are trimmed or even cut completely from the original. Bryan Cranston's Cohaagen makes me miss Ronny Cox even more, and Bill Nighy's resistance leader doesn't stand out compared to the 1990 film. The best thing the screenwriters did is to combine Sharon Stone's and Michael Ironside's characters from the 1990 film into one, and as portrayed by Kate Beckinsale, she kicks serious ass here.

The script is a near complete rehash of the original, save for the setting and the final act of the film. The scene where Bokeem Woodbine's character tries to convince Quaid (Farrell) where he's still in a dream is certainly a standout scene which was very well done. Alas, the majority of the movie is laced with action sequences and sensational special effects (seriously, this is CGI porn) that may get this film a nomination for Best Visual Effects this year. No kidding. While the editing is fast-paced and the cinematography sleek (with a little too much lens flare ala J. J. Abrams), the music score by Harry Gregson- Williams was kind of bland in my opinion. It was just there, does its job, and I didn't care. Where's Marco Beltrami; or even for that matter his legendary mentor, the late, great Jerry Goldsmith when you need them?

Director Wiseman has a knack for action sequences (""Underworld"", ""Die Hard 4"") and it shows aplenty here. Sadly the script could've been a whole lot better, but then again, if they had set it on Mars it would've been a shot-for-shot remake with better characters, but still I would've loved to see action on the Red planet once again. The PG-13 rating is justified, and there are indeed little homages to the original, but overall this remake is nothing more than a fast-paced, popcorn munching good waste of time, with some really nice CGI to chew on.

However, I'd rather watch the old one again. Arnie has a much stronger screen presence than Farrell and it is much more ambitious and has more heart than this sleeker, newer one.",1355961600,,3135,4.8964218455743875

4764077,2,B005LAII3U,"First off. Amazons rating system of two stars, which I gave the film, means, ""I don't like it"", not ""I hated it."" The only reason I didn't hate it was because the set designs were very good and the surroundings in hi def were decent. But, put that aside and the movie is a tiring act of emptiness. I was expecting Colin Farrell to put a hard edge spin on the Douglas Quade character but he looked lost, straining to look fearful, surprised and angry. Very disappointing acting by Farrell and the rest of the cast. I had heard that the story would not take place on Mars as the original did and figured that would detract somewhat. Well, it detracted a ton, and left the filmmakers scrambling to replicate a Bladerunner environment that visual looked good but emptied the core of the story.

The whole feel of Rekall (that's how they spelled it)was lost. In the original Quade really seemed innocent, and his secret agent desires fully contradicted his ""normal"" life."" This film loses the dual memory concept and that in turn plays down the ""fish out of water"" excitement that should have driven the film. Both Biel and Beckensale were uninteresting and gave off zero sex appeal. I felt this era of film making would have given us a serious chick fight but the usual chop/cut style crap was thrown at us again.

Worst of all was the villian. So bad that I not only don't remember his name but I don't care. And how many grueling scenes did we sit through of Quade almost being killed except that the killer needed to give fill explanations of why before doing so. Films always give some of that but this became annoyingly full throttle. Lots of gun fire but did you really care who got hit? It's bad when you can almost envision the film cameras nearby and the director yelling ""go"" as the action plays out.

Although I have seen the somewhat campy original several times, I think I will now seek it out on blu ray and watch a real interesting sci fi film that had a gripping quality to it. Total Recall 2012 as it relates to the acting and script is a boring failure. Looking back, the original was pretty darn good.",1355961600,3,2116,4.462532299741602

There's so much potential in the story to be a heavier psychological thriller, but instead everything just ran fast for the sake of action sequences.  Not one of Colin Farrell's best movies in my opinion.  So many styles were copied in this movie.  It was like Minority Report meets Blade Runner shot through the lens of J.J. Abram's Star Trek (blatant overuse of lens flares) and with an orchestral score that sounded lifted from Tron Legacy.  I also didn't like how this future world just happened to have dubstep as the popular music for a nightclub.  Waste of money?

I found the action sequences entertaining but it had a brainless Michael Bay feel to it with a few lines of wisdom thrown in (e.g. Farrell talking to a coworker about doing what they're told without questioning whether it's right or wrong).

The good: the special effects. The world of this Total Recall might not be Mars but it's a mesmerizing dystopian display. The Fall was very cool.

The bad: the premise wasn't entirely believable, perhaps because it wasn't fully developed, while viewers may find they have little emotional connection to the characters. A big part of this was because Farrell was sort of like Rambo; I never really feared for his life. It always amazes me in how these types of movies the good guys can be fired at 1,000 times but most of the bullets miss, and the ones that hit often knick a shoulder blade, hand, or foot.

The ugly: Um, who's idea was it to have a tri-breasted woman? He needs to be fired.

The bottom line: if you're looking for a bombastic, summer-style, Michael Bay-type, brainless, fun movie to take you out of reality for a few hours, this one is for you!

Thus, I waited until it was rentable...

Now, I'm sorry I waited. __ This 'remake' is AWESOME! (and I'm not a big Farrell fan either, so me saying that, says a lot)

TOTAL RECALL is a loose adaptation of the 1990 film, which was itself an even looser adaptation of Philip K. Dick's classic ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale.""  (Most Dick-to-film adaptations are incredibly loose...but I digress.)  The story is fairly simple, except that it isn't: Douglas Quaid is an everyman in the future, who has dreams of being a hero, fighting alongside a beautiful woman.  These dreams lead him to Rekall, where he's promised the adventure of a lifetime--totally simulated, of course.  Except things go wrong, and Quaid finds himself in a real-life espionage case...except, of course, it may all be the fictional programming.

Okay.  Snicker all you want, those of you who've watched the film.  Paul Verhoeven's original actually left viewers a sense of doubt; while not the greatest sci-fi movie of all time, it was a great action vehicle that presented some surprisingly deep characterization, and prompted quite a bit of thought on the part of the viewer (it was and remains a very political film).  Len Wiseman's remake never leaves much to the imagination.  We know who to root for because he's good looking and charismatic and, well, his wife's just not a nice lady.  Wiseman gave us UNDERWORLD and LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, so we shouldn't bee expecting much depth in the first place.  (And the script is by-the-numbers; great actors like Bryan Cranston and Colin Farrell chew their way through dialogue that is far beneath them; Cranston's entire purpose is to reiterate the plot, for those in the audience who weren't following along.)  Wiseman is keen on visuals, not characterization; and yes, this is a very visual movie, though not as awe-inspiring as the original still remains.  It's got a grittiness that one can't help but like, however, and the action sequences are well-choreographed (perhaps too well).

The acting isn't that great; don't be surprised.  Farrell has proven he's got the charisma to be a lead actor in more independent films (IN BRUGES is a modern classic), and on TV's BREAKING BAD, Cranston has become the epitome of the villain everyone loves to hate.  But here, they've got two-dimensional parts.  It's nice to see Farrell getting a paycheck, but that's basically all this is.  As our femme fatales, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel have big shoes to fill; Beckinsale proves she's up to the challenge (she's done this before), Biel not so much.  Billy Nighy drops by for a bit and does his brooding thing, and Bokeem Woodbine just oozes charm as Quaid's friend.  There's a nice (yet confusing) cameo in the unrated version; I won't spoil it.  And that's about all we get on the acting front.  It's all we can expect.  TOTAL RECALL is a film to be enjoyed with your friends, tossing popcorn into your mouth and laughing at all of the absurdities, while simultaneously being impressed that we have the technology to make films like this.  Is it in any way comparable to the original?  Of course not.

4764381,4,B005LAII3U,"Totally better than the original!  This is a very, very good movie.  This is a case of the remake being pretty much better than the original in just about every way.  I was surprised.  That was unexpected.  There have been remakes that are no better than the original, or not even as good.  Case in point is ""Clash of the Titans"".  The remake of that film is very good, but could not quite match Ray Harryhausen's original.  Sure, the special effects were better, but it's hard to match the original casts of Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, Harry Hamlin, and Burgess Meredith.  To me, the writing and the acting are mostly what makes a good movie.  The other stuff, the special effects, are just icing on the cake.  So, what makes this remake of ""Total Recall"" better than the original?  As I have stated above, the writing and the acting.

Arnold Schwarzenneger has a more imposing physical presence than Colin Farell, but there is no doubt who the better actor is.  Colin's performance is a bit understated compared to Arnold's, but in my mind, that's for the better.  And you do not have to make excuses for Colin's acting abilities.  The standout performance here comes from Kate Beckinsale.  As I have said of her before in my previous movie reviews, she has established herself as one of the top female action stars in the business.  Not only that, she actually has the acting chops to pull off just about any role she's been in.  I actually cannot recall a movie in which she performed badly.  The Lori character has been expanded from the original role played by Sharon Stone.  And maybe that has to do with director Len Wiseman being Kate's real-life spouse, but it was a very good call on his part.  Or rather the writer's part.  I admit to being a fan of Beckinsale's, but she honestly is very good at her craft.  At this point in her career, she is one of the best all-around actresses in Hollywood.  Ofcourse, Jessica Biel is also one very good performer.  Jessica gets better and better every year.  And as she gets older, her sensuality and her sexiness also mature.  This Jessica Biel has a different screen presence than the one that played Abigail in ""Blade"".  Her acting has been solid ever since ""Easy Virtue"".  There is very good chemistry between the three leads in this film.  And credit goes to the leads' having lots of acting experience under each of their belts.  This movie has an all-star cast.

Doug Quaid is an underpaid assembly line worker in a robot factory.  He lives in a dumpy apartment, and yet, has a very beautiful and quite obviously sophisticated wife.  He has been having strange dreams lately.  Bothered by those dreams, he decides to visit Rekall.  Rekall is a provider of recreational fantasy, delivered in the form of memory injections.  Basically, you can experience your chosen fantasy using memory implants to trick your brain.  Basically, Rekall takes you on a brain trip, and your brain cannot differentiate between those memories and reality while it's ""tripping"".  While at the Rekall recreation clinic, Doug experiences a complication.  The proprietor then tells us this is due to a conflict between the memory that Doug already has in his head and those they are trying to put in.  So, yeah, obviously Doug is more than just a production technician who assembles robots in a factory line.  The police SWAT team barges in and storms the clinic.

It is hard to write a review without spoiling the plot.  In this case, I believe most of you will already have a good idea of the central plot.  Doug manages to elude the SWAT team and makes it back to his house.  As he tells Lori what happened at the clinic, he is further surprised when she tries to kill him.  A very entertaining fight breaks out.  Great choreography and stunt work, by the way.  Doug manages to escape and meets up with Melina.  She knows who he is, but it takes him quite some time to accept that his real name is Carl.  The story then diverges from that of the original, but I do not believe that is necessarily a bad thing.

In any case, this is a very good movie.  Len Wiseman shows once again just how capable of a director he is.  I think this is his genre.  He is good with these action films.  Bokeem Woodbine, Bill Nighy, Bryan Cranston, and John Cho play very capable supporting roles.  All in all, a solid action movie.",1355788800,,4352,4.5851755526658

4764384,4,B005LAII3U,"From Len Wiseman (director of the ""Underworld"" films, ""Live Free or Die Hard"") comes a remake of the the 1990 film of the same name and based on the 1966 short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" by Philip K.Dick.

With the original 1990 film directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin becoming a box office success and receiving praise from film critics for its complexity as a sci-fi film, for its remake, the film was to be more of an adaptation of the original short story but instead became more of action film with beautiful, modern visual effects.

The film made over $198 million in the box office during the summer of 2012 and now, will be released on Blu-ray which will include both the theatrical version and the extended director's cut.

VIDEO:

""Total Recall"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio) and while the film is primarily all visual effects and great use of green screen, on Blu-ray this film looks magnificent.  If anything, I guess the best word to describe the picture quality is ""perfect"".  Detail is amazing, the film looks natural, close-up shots are impressive and I'm just impressed of how awesome the environments look.  Black levels are nice and deep, no sign of banding, artifacts, aliasing or anything negative.  ""Total Recall"" looks magnificent in HD!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

And as one expects from a big budget film when it comes to picture quality, lossless audio doesn't disappoint at all.  Presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1, Spanish and French 5.1 Dolby Digital and an English Audio Description Track, the lossless soundtrack to ""Total Recall"" is immersive and an audiophile's dream.  With so much action featured in the film, directional audio of shootouts come from all over the soundscape and is truly immersive.  Ambiance of the city and crowds are also clear and the booms, crashes and bullets striking objects and the overall chaos that happens within the city, great LFE and great use of the surround channels!  Dialogue and music is crystal clear from the front and center channels and the film sounds absolutely dynamic.  ""Total Recall"" features a fantastic lossless soundtrack!  There is nothing negative about it!  Like the picture quality, the lossless soundtrack is perfect!

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

EXTRAS:

""Total Recall: Extended Director's Cut"" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to download the movie to your computer and select Apple and Android devices and stream to computers, tables or smartphones.  Also, included is a slipcover case and both extended and director's cut versions of the film with an extra Blu-ray disc containing the special features.  Also, a video game demo for ""God of War: Ascension"" for the Sony PS3 is included.

I'm quite aware of the criticism ""Total Recall"" had received, especially when compared to the 1990 film version.  But in someway, I give credit to Len Wiseman for taking on a sci-fi film which the original has its own cult following.  The question was how was he going to make things different.

Giving credit to the 1990 Paul Verhoeven film, it was during a time when people were craving something new and unique.  Top films of the year were ""Ghost"", ""Home Alone"", ""Pretty Woman"", ""Dances with Wolves"" and for sci-fi films, it was pretty much ""Total Recall"" and ""Back to the Future III"".  With ""Total Recall"", the film relied on plot, creativity and for its time, it was unique, humorous and imaginative.  People loved the originality with the film and for the 2012 film, aside from using modern visual effects, it's not going to be easy to create a better film, when the original film was so well-liked!

My approach to this 2012 version was a film created for today's generation, using the latest in CG visual effects and creating a sci-fi world that would look even more fantastic and amazing than the original film.  And for the most part, I feel that Len Wiseman and crew did accomplish that.

But one of the strong points of the original film was its plot and humor, this time around, ""Total Recall"" is more of a popcorn action film and it seems that for today's cinema, it's something that audiences continue to come out for and enjoy and move-on.  When I think about this film, the original 1990 film made you want to watch it again and over 20-years-later, I have watched the 1990 version of ""Total Recall"" on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray a good number of times.

And with the original 1990 film, it maintained some semblance to the original short story that it takes place on Mars.  This new film, there is nothing about Mars at all, nor are their aliens.  The original was darker, bloodier but that's what makes the 1990 version a sci-fi classic.  The 2012 version doesn't try to be anything like the original, it doesn't want to be an exact remake and I like that.  I tend to dislike remakes of older films but if they can maintain some semblance to the original but yet be something different, I'm all for it.

We have seen remakes or reboots with films such as ""Hulk"", ""Spider-Man"",  ""Superman"", ""Karate Kid"" and the list goes on and on.

But with ""Total Recall"", the original was a sci-fi film was dark comedy elements, this 2012 version is a visual effects-driven, popcorn action sci-fi film.  In my opinion, two different types of films.

And for those who feel that the 2012 version was dumbed down to be too action-driven, well, if you followed Len Wiseman's films, as a director or producer, the ""Underworld"" films have been like that and even his earlier film ""Live Free or Die Hard"" has been like that.  The fact is that Wiseman is a director who was hired to take on this film because of his experience in action-films.  And for today's audiences who are exposed to video games that tend to be more eye candy and short on plot, a lot of action films seem to be that way and today's audiences are digging it.

Personally, with director Len Wiseman and the casting of Colin Farrell, Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale, I pretty much expected an action film and nothing to deep or thought-provoking.  So, I came out watching this film with no negative feelings, whatsoever.  I got what I expected and maybe even more with the stunning beautiful visual effects and the outstanding picture quality and lossless audio on Blu-ray.

What I enjoyed about this 2012 Blu-ray release is that you get both the theatrical and extended director's cut edition.  And for those who really want to get into the mindset of the challenges that Len Wiseman faced as a director, the audio commentary included with this Blu-ray release is worth listening to!  In fact, there are a good number of special features included on this Blu-ray release, although a good number of them are quite short.

Regardless, there's nothing to be angry or spiteful to this film because the original 1990 version is out on Blu-ray.  I look at this as a film tailored to today's audiences who want more action, more visual effects. And that's what the audience is getting.  So, if you enjoyed the original, there is a Blu-ray release for the Paul Verhoeven film available.

Overall, ""Total Recall: Extended Director's Cut"" is one of the most beautiful looking sci-fi films on Blu-ray in 2012, looks great, sounds magnificent and a good number of special features are included.  But for anyone looking for something deep or thought-provoking, this is not that type of film.  This is a film for those who love popcorn action films and beautiful sci-fi visual effects.  And if you are that type of viewer, then ""Total Recall: Extended Director's Cut"" is a Blu-ray release that I can easily recommend to you!",1355788800,2,9548,4.886123210952085
4764385,3,B005LAII3U,"""Maybe I need my mind messed with."" Dennis Quaid (Farrell) is tired of his boring life. One night on an impulse he goes to a place called Recall to get a new memory that he can look back on. While there something goes wrong and Quaid finds himself the target of very powerful people, and his wife...or does he? For those of you (like me) that grew up with the original movie this is probably one you were looking forward to but hesitant to see (at least I was). I will have to say that it was better then I was expecting. There were quite a few call backs to the original movie and some were really funny when they were thrown in. Not giving anything away but instead of going to save Mars in this one Quaid tries to save Australia (it's a future version but still). To me that was a little hard to get behind. For the most part though the movie did a good job of being new while not forgetting the original. This just wasn't as good. Overall, another remake that isn't as good as the original. I give it a B.",1355702400,,1009,4.126903553299492

4764387,5,B005LAII3U,"I was pleasantly surprised by this remake. It's been years since I've watched the original. I remember that version as somewhat cheesy with low budget special effects & cinematic style.

This new version succeeds in several ways for me.

It does a great job visually. Sure it borrows from Blade Runner and other movies, but it does it well. I loved that the movie created the kind of density of urban grit like in Ridley Scott's Los Angeles, 2019. The tunnel through the earth was kind of new, if somewhat a stretch of physics. But I routinely accept things equally as unlikely such as Star Trek & Star Wars FTL travel.

The sets and cityscapes, design of the cars and urban areas were visually delicious.

I liked the Bourne-esque action too. Nicely done.

I found Collin Farrel's not overly intellectual Quaid/Hauser to be likeable and vulnerable, tough and sexy. Kate Beckinsdale did a great job being the bad guy.

I liked the nods to the original, especially the lady in the security checkpoint.

It's a fun, energetic popcorn sci-fi action film. It's not deep, it will not elevate your soul or make any heavy handed important statements about society or the origin of man. I think it's important to judge a film on it's own terms without so much preconception & expectations and also be able to just enjoy a  visual ride.

If you are a fan of hard core sci-fi & don't have a stick in your i/o port then check it out.",1355616000,5,1422,4.566929133858268
4764388,3,B005LAII3U,"""Never remake a hit movie; only a flop.  Otherwise, you will always be competing with the memory of the original film.""

That's a basic canon of Hollywood moviemakers that seems to be increasingly ignored these days.  Remakes of SABRINA, 3:10 TO YUMA and THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL are just three relatively recent examples that prove the viability of that rule.

Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in the original 1990 version of TOTAL RECALL, directed by Paul Verhoeven, and which is, in this writer's opinion, one of the best science-fiction movies ever made.  (A small caveat: I am not a big fan of science-fiction movies.  There are a very few that I like.)

Now, TOTAL RECALL has been remade, this time starring Colin Farrell with Len Wiseman directing.

Though the original is a better film overall, this new action-thriller will certainly entertain viewers, particularly those who have not seen the 1990 film.  It does, however, make some essentially cosmetic changes to the storyline of Verhoeven picture, including combining two key characters into one.

Set near the end of this century when most of Earth in uninhabitable, this version of the Philip K. Dick short story (""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"") has Farrell playing Douglas Quaid, a factory worker who visits Rekall, a company that can turn his superspy fantasies into real memories.  But, when the procedure goes terribly wrong, the line between fantasy and reality blurs.  Quaid discovers that his life is an illusion.  He becomes a man on the run; the only person alive who can save the lives of half the planet.

Where this 2012 picture betters the original version of TOTAL RECALL is in its masterful use of CGI special effects, which were not available when the 1990 film was made.  Indeed. Wiseman and his crew have created a marvelous futuristic world that evokes and even betters memories of movies like BLADE RUNNER and MINORITY REPORT.  The action sequences are exciting and the performances from the talented cast (Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel,  Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy) are first rate.

Unfortunately, Wiseman has allowed the action sequences and superb visual effects to overshadow story and characterization, which results in his film being less compelling than its predecessor.

As previously stated, if you haven't seen the Schwarzenegger version of TOTAL RECALL, you will definitely enjoy this unnecessary remake much more than I did.

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has made TOTAL RECALL available in 3 and 2 Disc Blu-Ray/DVD combo packs, as well as a single disc DVD edition.  All three choices include extras (e.g. gag reel, ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes, etc.).

4764437,2,B005LAII3U,"I was excited to see what the remake had in store for fans of the Schwarzenegger Total Recall but unfortunately I was disappointed on several levels. First off, I own the old version on Blu-Ray and have watched it too many times to admit. You've got classic Schwarzenegger muscles and bad acting coupled with Sharon Stone as a fit and feisty femme fatale set against the backdrop of interplanetary espionage and sordid love triangles. What's not to love about that? And of course, my favorite - the essential element of a midget prostitute involved in a gun battle at a Martian t1tty bar!!

So in the remake we've got Colin Farrell - who was poorly cast as the lead here. He doesn't exude confidence in this role and personally I think the role demands it in order to keep the viewer engaged. When Colin Farrell looks like he forgot how to spell his own name, the only thing I'm thinking about is Schwarzenegger and his commanding performance that left me no time to wonder what the heck I was doing watching such garbage. Aside from the lead, the character development is shallow as a paper plate. We don't give a damn about the lead's female counterpart since we only experience her for a few minutes on screen before she turns into an action all star and promptly kicks our lead's butt. Does that make you care for either of them more? Not in my case. And sorry to say it, but the brief fight scene between Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone was palatable whereas the scene here with Farrell and Beckinsale reeks of stunt performance. Honestly, by that point, I was already disappointed in the setup and the main characters.

Also - did anyone get the sense that the set was more important than any aspect of the plot? The sets here were very elaborate but they seemed to be more of the focus than the actors interacting with them. The crazy housing sets or even the posh digs where our lead gets to interact with a recording of himself were all very detailed - but they didn't further the plot. They didn't move anything along. They didn't engage or compel the viewer. So they ultimately fail at achieving their goal, which is to enrich the authenticity of the experience for the viewer.

I could go into more detail about how the director and casting director failed at making this remake strong enough to stand on its own - but I think you get my sense of disappointment here. I give this film a resounding thumbs down and refer all viewers back to the Schwarzenegger version for their entertainment needs.",1355097600,4,2509,4.583518930957684

4764529,1,B005LAII3U,"First - I don't like remakes!  Second - I don't like remakes of popular films!  Third - I am tired of British people dominating American cinema - I thought that there was a revolution in 1776?  Fourth - I don't like Collin Farrell as a leading man, I just don't like his look.  Last, if it ain't broke, don't try to remake it!

This film tries to improve upon the original with new technology and fancy effects, but that is the only thing that improved with this lousy remake.  They took away the Mars theme and traded it with the UK and it's partner in crime, Australia being the only places left on earth!  I wonder if this is saying something about our future?  They took away Mathias being a little creature with a human host, which left him being no more mysterious or fascinating than one of the buildings in the film.  The robots were more interesting, if not Star Wars-like.

The casting was horrible too!  As mentioned, I am sick and tired of the British always starring in American movies!!  They not only play all major super heroes, but now they are in everything in a way that they do not even explain why a British person would be in the US military or be in the US playing a role in which ever film!  Given the polarization in this country, I would not be surprised if they were behind it!  Why do we keep hearing about THEIR royal family as if they are ours?  We'd better wake up!  Anyway, the cast was bad because the two principle females looked too much alike!  In the original, you had the white, blond Sharon Stone contrasting with the cute, black/hispanic Rachel Ticotin.  You had Arnold and others characters who looked distinct!  This was bad.

Hauser throughout most of the film did not trust, know or care about any of the other characters except way into the film when Mathias is killed.  Then he reacts as if he cared when he just met the guy like 5 minutes earlier!  Then after that, he all of a sudden cares about people!  This was bad.  Then at the end, he looks dead, but of course with Hollywood clichs, you know that people never die and then the ending after that made it even worse because it looked like an added scene with no rhyme or reason.  This film had poor character development, and unlike the original, we at least liked Arnold, felt that the women were cute and sexy and the bad guys were bad.  We even had a feel as to why the people were oppressed and why the whole story existed.  Here, it was just polishing up in the looks department and that was it.  I swear, the people my age (40) who grew up with these films must be the writers and producers these days and the only thing they seem to know is to remake things or make films out of toys they loved back in the 80's.  If you need ideas, hire me!

The remake artists in Hollywood need to know this, the original had appeal because of it's star in Arnold.  Even though the technology was limited then, the effects and look of the film had an appeal that made you want to see it.  The story as it was in the original made you care and want to see it through while with this one, I was hoping that everyone died in the end!  It looks like they set it up for a sequel - I hope not!  Since this flopped at the box office (good - the more people who stay away from remakes, the more they will abandon it), they should not do it again. I don't know why they would spend what they spent on this remake.  It was all looks and not story.  ENOUGH WITH THE REMAKES!",1355011200,4,3457,4.224427480916031
4764530,3,B005LAII3U,I think the best part of the movie is the special effects and futuristic technologies.  It is definately helpful to watch the first Total Recall to appreciate some of the twists of scenes.  I would have liked to see a better ending to the story line. Some of the serious emotional scenes had me wondering if the retakes were accidently left in.,1354838400,,344,4.532258064516129
4764531,3,B005LAII3U,"Decent action, love the cityscapes, the nods to the original were good. Would have liked to had more dialog from the main character.",1354752000,,132,4.782608695652174
4764532,5,B005LAII3U,"I'm primarily interested in the storyline differences between the Director's Cut and its theatrical counterparts, so here are the differences between the two (NOTE: SPOILERS FOLLOW).

The Director's Cut runs about 12 minutes longer than the theatrical cut.  No additional gore has been added although additional F-bombs have been added.  Ethan Hawke makes a surprise appearance in a scene that was cut from the theatrical movie.

(1) Extra scene of Quaid meeting with a Human Resources Management representative from the Cohaagen administration who requests that he sign a non-disclosure agreement given that he works at a sensitive defense production factory.  (I can see why this was cut as it didn't add much to the overall storyline.)

(2) Extra scene of scantily clad women in Rekall neighborhood.  (The three mammary gland-ed lady still makes the same appearance with topless nudity.)

(3) In the scene where Quaid finds the hidden holographic piano recording in his apartment, it has been altered to show Ethan Hawke as the old Quaid, revealing that Cohaagen also gave Quaid facial reconstructive surgery. (This was an interesting twist which I wished they had left in.  It explains why no one was able to recognize him.)

(4) When Quaid and Melina escape from Lori in the elevator action sequence, there is a re-inserted shot of the destroyed elevator plunging onto the roadway below and destroying a hover car.  (Pretty neat CGI!)

(5) During the UFB assault on Matthias's base, there is an extra shot of a white combat synth gunning down some hapless Resistance members.

(6) Melina is revealed to be Matthias's daughter.  Cohaagen also refers to Melina as Matthias's daughter, rather than lieutenant.

(7) Cohaagen talks a little more about his plan to use Quaid to lead to Matthias, revealing that it was Quaid's idea to have his memory wiped in order to feign allegiance to Matthias.

(8) When Cohaagen has Quaid strapped to the chair, Quaid instead yells an F-word laced expletive at Cohaagen.

(9) When Cohaagen ponders what to do with Melina, she spits in his face and screams the F-word, whereas in the theatrical cut she says ""Never!""

(10) The climactic final fight is slightly longer, showing an additional shot of UFB black-clad special forces troops getting gunned down by Melina and the fight between Cohaagen's black painted super-synth bodyguard and Quaid is slightly longer.

And that's it.  The biggest addition is Ethan Hawke's reinserted scene.

I enjoyed the Total Recall re-make, even if it lacked some of the campy humor and ridiculous gore of Paul Verhoeven's original.  I give it five stars for completely shallow reasons- Kate Beckinsale!  Hello.  Heck if I were Quaid and married to Kate Beckinsale I'd forget about Rekall.  Jessica Biel is easy on the eyes too.  The re-make is darker and more serious, akin to Minority Report meets Total Recall.  It seems to combine elements from both the Arnold film and Philip Dick's ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"".

In a nod to the Verhoeven film, Harry and Quaid talk about going to Mars, a synthetic thug loses his arm, a similar looking ""two weeks"" woman walks by customs, Quaid uses holograms, Federal police engage in a zero-G gunbattle with Quaid, and the iconic three breasted woman makes an appearance.  Missing of course are the memorable Johnny Cab, Benny, the poor sap who gets perforated on the escalator, and Kuato.

The action scenes are well staged even if TDI Vector sporting Federal police are mowed down like stormtroopers.  The technology is fascinating, especially ""The Fall"" and hand insertable phones.  The Colony's populace has a distinct Asian overtone and is more Blade Runner-esque.  The UFB is probably situated in England to make Beckinsale's native accent more convenient.

I only wish they had made a hard R-version rather than pander to the PG-13 desires of studio executives.",1354752000,175,3890,5.054945054945055

I'm a fan of this type movie so it was high on my list as soon as I heard about it.  I have read some not so good reviews but I guess these guys just don't get it.

4764535,4,B005LAII3U,"I haven't seen the theatrical release, so this review is strictly for the unrated version. I really enjoyed this film, even though I kept thinking about the Arnold version I grew up with. The 1990 Total Recall is superior in many ways, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this one. There are enough differences between the two to enjoy both. I'm not against remakes in general, but I think they work better when they take a good idea from a movie or tv show that didn't quite work, rather than remake a largely successful film. That said, this one does pretty well.

Colin Farrell replaces Arnold Schwarzenegger as Douglas Quaid, and his wife is now played by Kate Beckinsale. Colin is much more of the everyman than Arnold was in the role. The movie follows the same basic plot, with some small and large differences. There's no more mars, no more mutants vs. humans. The movie is almost exclusively shown from Farrell's perspective, which helps the dream vs. reality debate.

Overall, this movie was well worth my time. I enjoyed watching it. While it may not quite measure up to the original, it was still an enjoyable ride.",1354579200,,1133,4.66

Essentially one long chase scene, I thought the CGI was great, Colin F. did a far better job of being stressed and confused, while Kate B. had a delicious relentless menace. I'm still not sure what Jessica B. did.

Pay no mind to the gaping plot-holes. (tunnel through the Earth's core? hardware store respirators and civie clothes in the No-Go zone contaminated by bio-weapons?) This is not a thinking person's film. Lower your expectations, open up the popcorn, kick back and enjoy.",1354579200,,685,5.0

Really?! The original was better? Even so, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THIS MOVIE WAS A ONE STAR PRODUCTION YOU IMBECILES!

The problem with this movie is that the demographic they were trying to market to seem to have this irrational grudge against the new Total Recall. I believe this movie is NOT a remake. This movie is a RE-IMAGINING. One LARGE piece of evidence that supports my claim is that the story is TOTALLY different from the original. So you can't really call it a remake. It's a re-imagining. Sure, it's the same basic premise, but the two movies are so different you can't compare them which is what many of the bad reviewers seem to be doing.

In all the reviews giving this movie below 3 stars are all whining about the same thing: ""the original was better."" That's the fatal flaw in their review. They set themselves up for failure when watching this movie if they were expecting a 1990's Total Recall with better graphics.

There is NO WAY in hell this movie deserves ONE star. I mean just LOOK at it. This is NOT a one star film. It's AT LEAST a 3 star film. It's a clean production. Good graphics, gripping story, good acting, nice twist =! one star. Sure, the plot is a little shallow but that doesn't make the movie one star.

Anyone that gives this movie one star is just a butthurt idiot that is oblivious to their hipster jealousy by saying ""the original was better"". Get over yourself and just enjoy the movie for what it is: a graphically spectacular straight forward sci-fi movie.",1354406400,23,1719,4.517684887459807
4764601,3,B005LAII3U,"I might have liked the original movie better if Arnold hadn't been cast as the star. Never liked anything he did. Hate his accent. He just sounds stupid every time he speaks.

I suppose most special effects driven movies can only get better with time - new computer technology and much better programs for CGI.
This movie was much more sophisticated than the original, for the above reason, but also much better  casting First character Kate Beckinsale played that I actually hated and I found her ridiculous in the role. Come on hollywood, how long do you think people are going to swallow the beautiful 110 pound models kicking a$$ BS?. ""Oh, I broke a nail! "" If you're going to portrey a woman being a hands on killer, make it realistic. Make her a butch babe who kills from behind. This cuty-pie who stands toe to toe with a man in hand to hand combat is just ridiculous.  That happens so often in real life, doesn't it?
The one thing I really disliked about this movie is that it was shot in so much darkness and shadow. I hate how it makes me sit up and lean foreward, straining my eyes, trying to see what's going on in every dark scene. Like the original Alien movie. I like to see special effects in bright light where you can really see it all.",1354406400,,1254,4.373390557939914

There is so much top-notch art direction, fantastic KICK-ASS action, and over all CGI sci-fi production quality that this movie should have been a bigger hit than what it did in the theaters. If you don't care for the story line, then at least watch it for the high level grade A+++ CGI and art direction. This movie was different enough from the original to stand on it's own. OUTSTANDING!

But instead of getting our collective asses to Maaas, we go - wait for it - to dreary old future London, which looks pretty much like dreary old present day London if you ask me.

Somehow in the future only Britain and Australia remain, with Australia being a colony of Britain connected through an underground tunnel/elevator that can go from one end to the earth to the other in 17 minutes, in a massive elevator like gizmo. Other that that the local are pretty much interchangeable only in Australia the houses hang from the sky, which I guess makes sense because its on the other side of the world.

The whole movie is littered with silly references from the original movie which is cute at first, but later serves as a constant reminder of how much better the original was. The whole movie seems to be pieced together from the left overs of other movies, the police robots look like they are lifted straight from Star Wars, the constant rainy dreariness from blade Runner. This movie shares with the original the name, the three breasted hooker and the name of the protagonists and that's it, to call this a remake is just laughable...

The equivalent would be to remake Star Trek, but instead of all the cool space ships and stuff you cast Gilbert Gotfried as Captain Kirk driving a school bus through Burbank that's named 'The Enterprise' .... Ugh completly forgettable....",1354233600,38,1518,4.656716417910448

4764607,4,B005LAII3U,"I had read many of those one star reviews here and could hardly feel for them. The movie is by no means crap. Definitely the original one is a real classic. I think the producer and the director of this remake knew it well and they respect that. Yet, they had definitely put significant amount of energy and resources to pay homage to the old one whilst instilled quite a lot of new stuff in it. Unarguably there were many loopholes in this screenplay. IMHO, those eye catching futuristic designs and the smart chasing scenes had compensated for many of those shortcomings. In case you simply want to relax and enjoy an action movie after a day's hard work, this is for sure a very good choice.

No. I just thought Schwarzenegger's cardboard acting combined with the cheesy dialogue and mediocre action scenes made the original movie, overall, a subpar film. Don't get me wrong, the storyline is great, but we can thank Phillip K. Dick for that. It's nostalgia that makes the original a classic. I just don't see how anyone can think the performace Schwarzenegger put on was lightyears ahead of Colin Ferrell's. I just don't see it. Not saying Ferrell is some Oscar worthy actor, but some of the hate this movie is getting is just ridiculous. I thought it was full of action, great storylines, and wonderful special effects. Plus, Kate Beckinsale in her underwear...worth the five stars alone. I don't think this is some movie of the year or something, but I think people are comparing it to the original a little too much, and if you just take it for what it is, a rendition of a classic film, you may enjoy it more.",1353110400,2,1087,4.551020408163265
4764679,4,B005LAII3U,"I'm a huge Phillip K. Dick fan, and the Recall/Rekall movies, although very loosely based on ""We can remember it for you wholesale"" are still a welcome addition to the numerous movies based on this highly original thinker's writings.

If you're a can of the original Arnold movie (the last big budget film to use practical effects - no CGI), you'll spot many homages to it in this movie. That adds to the cool factor.  We have miss triple C. When Quaid passes through security, the lady in front of him is almost a twin to Arnold's disguise. The arm being chopped off in the elevator. Miss three boob. There's more, but I want to avoid spoilers.

There are a LOT of continuity errors (watch the elevator chase scene carefully). One of the worst is the final scene on the drop ship.  How did their hardware (helicopters, etc.) change sides?!? Or not get totaled (clamps like the Green Hornet car used?) Also, lost of ""duh"" moments. Why would the ""colony"" evacuate to ""nozone shelters"" - the entire premise is that the nozone is uninhabitable and they don't have protection. If this society has antigravity and more highly advanced technology, why not expand the cities and clean up the polluted areas? How is it that the city is right next to and surrounded by a toxic environment - but the environment stays out? No dome. No technology. It just stays out. Drill THROUGH the earth? Because it's the ""only way"" to travel?!?

OK, so let's ignore all that. It's an entertaining movie with fantastic special effects and original fight scenes. Plenty of chases, a close-quarters cat-fight, running gun battles, maglev car chase - you name it.  The first 20 minutes or so leading up to the Rekall visit are ""eh"" - pretty boring. After that, it's a rapid build up to almost non-stop action. This is a movie I'll definitely buy on BluRay - just to frame through the cityscape during the car chase. The amount of thought that went into urban design with access to anti-gravity is mind-blowing. The DETAILS throughout the movie - wow. Watch it once. Then watch it again with your finger on the pause button. Easter eggs galore. Lots of cool tech (including the touch-screen faced fridge.)

It's not Arnold's Total Recall. In many way's it's better - it's decades later, so SFX have improved exponentially. In many ways it does not measure up. You'll have to decide for yourself.

But if you want an entertaining, fast-paced SciFi romp with a TON of eye candy (from the aforementioned triples to the city), plenty of fight scenes and gun battles, then don't miss this movie.",1352937600,,2562,4.703125

Which in some sort of way it did, but I'm still trying to figure out how.  Let's just say if you saw the original and loved it, you'll probably be disappointed by this one.  The visual effects are great and who doesn't love seeing Kate Beckinsale.  If you haven't had the opportunity to see the original, I urge you to give it a try (I know its old).  Like other reviewers have said, they were confused on what was going on through the movie.  I can see why.  If you haven't seen the original and knew what the plot was before hand, this movie can leave you dumbfounded.  It's very unstructured, doesn't explain the premise very well and is just a bunch of flashy effects.
If I could do it again, I would skip watching this movie and find the original and have a better experience.  Other than the supporting actors and the great visual effects, I personally did not enjoy this movie.",1352851200,3,992,4.406593406593407
4764681,3,B005LAII3U,"I was completely on-board this film for the first half.  Very engaging.  Suspenseful.  Len Wiseman also has far better taste in production design, costumes, and women than Paul Verhoeven.  That doesn't hurt.  The obvious visual influences did not bother me.  And I liked the concrete.  I'll admit, I did not get they were traveling through the center of the Earth with those ""The Fall"" transport machines.  I'm not sure I would have bought that if I'd caught onto it while watching.

At about the half-way point, I started being not as entirely engaged in the characters as I could have been.  I'm not certain why that was.  My first hunch is that the opening scene convinced me the protagonist was already a super-spy and was a miscalculation in editing... or perhaps just the wrong scene to have used.  But that should have affected the first half, right?  Was it the robots?  I had a similar disconnect in I-Robot, too.  Hmm...  I still enjoyed this, but somewhere it lost me a little even when it held onto my attention.

Looked amazing.  Action sequences I found to be very lucid and not overly frenetic.  And there are a few useful homages to the original film, including a neat little misdirect.  The score was good, too, but I heard hints of something better in there in the melodic layers and atmosphere that wasn't fully realized.  I felt the music had another level it could have achieved.  I was hearing the beginnings of a great score that just didn't quite pull off in the final pieces.

Maybe the robots, combined with the less soaring musical moments, combined with a lack of really key beats in the actors' performances... a sort of lack of space and connecting that kept this film from being great.  Perhaps the characters just lacked depth that the subject matter & look of the film called for?  Come to think of it, both the female characters are rather 2D.  And I'm not sure the protagonist's vulnerability was fully fleshed out.  Just a thought.

I went in looking for a deep sci-fi experience and all I got was a well-executed, visually-breathtaking action movie.  Not bad, but I felt it could have been something more.  Could it be... Schwarzenegger is a better actor than we give him credit for?  Or Verhoeven a true actors' director?  Those possibilities are blowing my mind right now.",1352678400,2,2311,4.7

Unfortunately, my gut feel got proven right. While I believe that anybody who has not seen the 90's version might find this movie entertaining, it remains very flat.

Do not get me wrong, I am not one of these nostalgic people who simply believe that ""it was better before"", and I am sure the old movie has aged poorly, but I have to say that in this case, I can only miss the humour, the 2nd degree of the previous movie...

4764686,2,B005LAII3U,"I have not seen the Total Recall from 1990, nor have I read the Philip K. Dick short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale that inspired that film and this one. I intended to watch the original soon after this one, but now I need a few days to cleanse my palette.  I can say without a doubt that this version has better special effects and more elaborate set design, but Total Recall feels like any generic science-fiction movie, re-worked to share elements with the story and slapped with the title to make more money. It's wonderful to look at and boasts the occasionally impressive sequence, but with Len Wiseman's humorless direction and a formulaic script, its little more than forgettable tripe. If Total Recall went by another name it would share the same fate as any other big-budget, predictable sci-fi movie from any given year; quickly disappearing from the public consciousness and ending up in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart. Despite reservations I had about the director (I've had issues with his films before) I was fond of the trailer and excited for the finished product. The trailer is the best thing about this movie.

It's the end of the 21st century and due to the devastation caused by global chemical warfare, Earth has become almost uninhabitable and is now divided into two superpowers; the United Federation of Britain and The Colony. Citizens commute between the two via The Fall, a gravity elevator that travels through the Earth's core. Enter factory worker Douglas Quaid (Colin Farrell), happily married for seven years to Lori (Kate Beckinsale) but growing tired of his recurring nightmares and monotonous lifestyle. One night Quaid decides to visit Rekall, a company that implants allows you to experience an imagined adventure. Things go awry when a SWAT team bursts in and Quaid instinctively takes them out. Arriving home, Lori reveals she's not his wife and is actually a UFB agent. Soon he's on the run from her and the entire police force. As he starts to piece together his real identity, he encounters Melina (Jessica Biel), a fixture of his recurring dreams. Bryan Cranston and Bill Nighy co-star as Cohaagen, the president of the UFB and Matthias Lair, the leader of the Colony's rebellion.

Total Recall takes inspiration from an earlier film and a short story, but the plot and visual aesthetic recall the Bourne movies, Blade Runner, Minority Report, and any run-of-the-mill science-fiction movie of the last ten years. There isn't an original idea here, but Wiseman's talent lies in visual exposition and he gives the material a fair presentation. If only he'd apply these talents to a better script. With non-stop action, Total Recall only grows dull in the tired way the story plays out. There are layers of mystery and intrigue in the plot, yet the film never builds suspense and many scenes are prolonged beyond necessary. It's bloated, predictable conclusion doesn't help nor does the silly way it attempts to engage the audience a final time in the last couple minutes.

The film is somber and humorless, as are the soulless performances. Farrell, Beckinsale, Biel, and Cranston are all charismatic people, yet they bring no charisma to their roles and share no chemistry with each other. Farrell brings likability, Cranston brings his usual intensity, and Beckinsale and Biel bring beauty; but this comes from their own natural persona. Wiseman knows how to create a dystopian world and stage large action sequences, but his grasp on character interaction leaves something to be desired.

The elaborate, murky set design makes the film great to look at and the stylized action sequences keep your attention, although there appears to be CGI in scenes of hand-to-hand combat. The futuristic car chase is one of the film's most thrilling scenes, but it's also derivative. A minor, biased complaint; why is there dubstep in this movie? Dubstep is this decade's disco. Is this really something we're going to hear at the end of this century?

Total Recall is not a colossal failure, nor is it frustratingly bad. It's just a mediocre, forgettable movie that goes through the motions of its genre. Wiseman has proven he can handle big-budget action movies, but he has yet to prove he can create something original or, at the very least, something that breaks from the formula. If not for the title, this film would disappear overnight.

4764760,1,B005LAII3U,"I went to see this movie purely because of the Philip K. Dick connection, unfortunately apart from the loose idea of someone having a memory erasion there is no Philip K. Dick here. PKD was a master of story weaving, of character forming, of plot building. What we have here is no story, cardboard characters and a plot that a 6 year old could have put together in 2 minutes. It's basically over 2 hours (my god is it long) of chasing and shooting - that's it ! nothing more ! I was unable to leave the cinema as I was with someone but I so wanted to do so. The Producer is largely to blame, although he was probably just doing as the film company requested i.e.: making some easy money. Everything about this film is awful, from the overbearing music to the casting. I wouldn't blame Colin Farrell too much as his acting is okay and he wasn't to know what a turkey he was getting involved in, although good actors would think very seriously before doing a remake. Kate Beckinsale is probably one of the worst things about this film, I've nothing against her, she's a fine actress when playing the right part but this is clearly not the right part - has there ever been a worse case of miscasting in cinema history ? She struts around supposedly tough and scary (I don't think so), her voice is irritating, her presence is annoying and her fighting scenes are cringe-worthy. There is absolutely nothing original in this film; The Terminator, The Matrix, Bond, Batman, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - the plagiarisms are all too evident. And the sets have been copied from a movie made 30 years ago (Bladerunner). I'm tempted to call this film pointless but of course it's not. Occasionally films are made for art's sake, for the love of producing something worthwhile, often it's purely about making money - and this is the point of this film. What's so sad for me is that the name of Philip K. Dick is associated with this garbage. I'm pretty sure that if the great man were alive today his lawyers would have made damn sure that his name was not associated with this film in any way, shape or form whatsoever.

That said, this version of Total Recall doesn't even come close.  The story is bland, the characters aren't interesting or believable, and there wasn't enough of Bryan Cranston in the movie to save it.  The only thing this movie has on the original is tremendous special effects - kind of like a souped-up version of ""Blade Runner"" mixed in with ""The Fifth Element"" (both of which were far superior movies).  And Jessica Biel and Kate Beckensale are incredible eye candy - not that Sharon Stone and Rachel Ticotin weren't in the original.  But there was something lacking in this movie that the original had - humor, fun, gory violence (not that that's a good thing, but it was sometimes so gruesome it was satiric in a way).  And Arnold was a far better Quaid than Colin Farrell, despite that fact that Farrell is a far superior actor.

So, two stars only for the special effects.  I think I'm being generous.",1349827200,8,1157,4.519230769230769

The character names are the same. Clearly the person who told me that was walking on their hands, and talking out of their - well, any how.

The film has great action, mixed acting, it's a solid scifi, however, the parallels in the story were so similar that when they changed parts (dramatically), the changes weren't better than the original, they were pretty disappointing. It's like hearing a song you like and are familiar with, but where they change words that originally rhymed, with words that now just don't, and don't really even fit in.

Ultimately the action and effects are much better than the original, as you would expect, however, the story is just too incoherent. I do recommend the movie, just beware.",1349740800,5,1049,4.726775956284153
4764764,5,B005LAII3U,"This take on the Philip K. Dick short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" is a much more faithful adaptation of the tale than the Arnold version. It's clear the director was also a fan of Blade Runner, another film based off of Dick's work, because it has the same gloomy atmosphere about it. This depiction of the future is dark and the film heads into noir territory, a complete turn from the lighthearted action film Arnold made in the 90's.

Colin Farrell has been having dreams of visiting Mars, and he feels an urge to experience these dreams. But he's not a rich guy, just a regular worker, so a vacation to Mars is too expensive for him. Enter Total Recall, a company that specializes in implanting false meories inside a client's head to make him/her have memories of a trip they did in actuality not make.

Farrell goes to the business, gets strapped in a chair and decides he wants to go to Mars as a double agent. After he's injected, things go very wrong.

This is a great take on Dick's short story and is filled with a gritty, seedy atmosphere. It has nice action, the acting is good, and the film is way underrated, no doubt due to fans of Arnold's Total Recall.

A huge letdown for the original Total Recall fans is the fact that Douglas Quaid (Farrell) doesn't go to Mars in the 2012 remake.

Having said that, It was just unbelievable that Farrel could kill a room full of guards but couldn't even bruise his wife. I will be buying this on dvd (huge Beckinsale fan here) but I honestly prefer the original with Arnold. Time may have produced a sleeker remake, but the plot of the original was simply better. It made more sense.  I loved the Mars angle of the original, it gave purpose to the elaborate deception of erasing Quaid's memory. I could see the value of introducing oxygen to Mars and why people would risk their lives for it. In this remake, I just do not understand anyone's motivation. What did the villain want? just to install an army of robots? Why erase Quaid's memory? They should have guessed where the resistance leader would be hiding, I did. It proved completely anti-climactic unlike the excellent special effects used to explain why the original resistance leader was so hard to find. I missed the elaborate makeup of the original mutants, even the effort to fool quaid into thinking he was still at recall was more believable in the original movie. As for special effects, Arnold and the gang didn't do such a bad job back in the day.

4764821,4,B005LAII3U,"I was a big fan of the cheesy 1990 movie with Arnold and the Canadian series Total Recall 2070 with Michael Easton and Karl Pruner. Anyways, this movie is pretty good as long as you go into it knowing that they don't go to Mars and the storyline is not exactly like Arnold's 1990 version. So if you have an open mind, it's very entertaining. The special effects, gadgets and the plot are good. I was very disappointed that Michale Ironsides character Richter and Benny the cabbie were removed. The three breasted hooker was a nice touch. I was disappointed that they didn't go to Mars. This was a huge detour from the original story that Philip K. Dick wrote. I'm not a huge Colin Farrel fan, but his acting along with Jessica Biel and Kate Beckensale really gives some meat and potatoes to the movie. The energy level and action is high, with few very lulls. I think the Mars storyline combined with some more humor would have made this a five star movie.

I highly recommend the Total Recall 2070 series to anyone who liked either of the Total Recall movies. The main plot of that series is primarily about a detective who constantly investigate the mysterious business practices of the company Recall. Recall often skirts the limit of the law, and when they do, they obstruct the detective with armies of lawyers. The detective has a partner who is equally mysterious and has many secrets of his own.

4764823,2,B005LAII3U,"The stories and novels of sci-fi futurist Philip K. Dick have been grist for the movie mill for quite some time since BLADE RUNNER hit the big screen in 1982, but it took until 1990 to get a new story of his onto the screen, based on the short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"", and that film then became Paul Verhoeven's over-the-top violent sci-fi extravaganza TOTAL RECALL, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox and Rachel Ticotin. Aside from it totally ignoring most of Dick's story, it's an incredibly fun, campy and action-packed romp.

With remakes usually equaling big money for the studios (especially if they can also squeeze out some 3D post-conversions or IMAX formatting), and the technical advances made over the last 22 years, director Len Wiseman (the first two UNDERWORLD films, LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD) took the reins of a not-totally-a-remake and not-totally-a-reimagining of TOTAL RECALL. As is Wiseman's forte, he makes it slick and gorgeous with some great effects and well-choreographed action sequences. Sadly, he also forgot to add any fun to this tale and he didn't allow any of the actors, such as Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale, Bryan Cranston and Jessica Biel, to develop any chemistry with each other.

Much of the original story's elements are still gone, but Wiseman and screenwriters Kurt Wimmer (also the writer/director of the great EQUILIBRIUM) and Mark Bomback (who also wrote LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD as well as... RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN...) as well as master production designer Patrick Tatopolous (who, along with working with Wiseman on UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION and LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, directed the third UNDERWORLD installment, subtitled RISE OF THE LYCANS) have firmly planted this film in a much grittier world of the future than was seen in the original film. It's the late 21st century, and much of the world has been made uninhabitable by chemical warfare, so all of the remaining humanity is now divided into two places in the world to live: the more well-to-do live in The United Federation of Britian and the more disenfranchised live on the other side of the world in the remains of Austrailia, now simply known as The Colony, and the only travel from one side to the other is via a massive gravity elevator called The Fall. We follow the humdrum life of Douglas Quaid (Farrell, playing it totally straight) who is a skilled laborer and his wife Lori (played with relish by Beckinsale). They live together in The Colony, which is a hybrid of the poorest parts of many different countries, with the two main influences being Rio de Janeiro and BLADE RUNNER's Los Angeles (the stacked-level apartments; brightly colored and seedy areas). He dreams of a life he never had and looks for some escapism, and this leads him to Rekall, a memory-implantation parlor where it gives you memories that feel like the real thing, and because his actual dreams are that of a tough-guy black-ops type spy, he selects to get implanted with their ""Secret Agent"" package. Although, this touches off a brutal assault on the parlor itself by a number of Federal Police, who Quaid suddenly finds that he is able to calmly disarm and kill all of them. He heads back home to Lori, who initially plays the loving wife and then turns murderous (and British) as she tries to kill him. After disarming her, she tells him that he is not Douglas Quaid; he's got false memories implanted in his head. This catalyst sets off a chain of events where Quaid becomes involved with the mysterious ""girl of his dreams"" Melina (Biel, again, totally straight), the corrupt Chancellor Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston, in a pretty physical performance) and the resistance fighting against Cohaagen's plans to take over the world, led my Matthias (Bill Nighy, not British for some reason). Also, just in case you didn't know, this could still just be a dream.

If you've seen the original, you literally have no reason to see this film, because although the film does change the plot of going to Mars and the mutants and the big ""Blue Sky on Mars"" mission, this film plays out very much in the same way. The only moments of ""humor"" to be found in this film are little nudge-nudge wink-winks to the original (the inexplicable appearence of a three-breasted woman, the fat red-headed woman going through security saying ""Two weeks"", etc.). Aside from that, the only fun to be found in this film are the masterfully-created action sequences that take place somewhat early on in the film, such as the fight between Doug and Lori, the magnetic car chase and the super-duper elevator shaft sequence are all incredibly well done and look about as polished as anything in modern film. Unfortunately, the cast (with the exception of Beckinsale) play these moments with deadly seriousness, and it's a real detriment to the enjoyment of the film. This is a SUMMER ACTION FILM REMAKE OF A SUMMER ACTION FILM. Why everyone decided that this should be played in the most serious tone possible was a major misstep for everyone involved. I'm certainly not in favor of all the summer films being without substance or story and should only be these magical one-liner machines, but not only is this film bereft of any real substance, it also just seems like everyone's going through the motions of making futuristic sci-fi. The only one that seems like they're enjoying themselves is Beckinsale, but of course being the director's wife does have its perks. And to be fair to Beckinsale, she is really good.

Also other unfortunate side-effects of this remake/reimagining is the distinct lack of two things that were so essential to the success of the first film: First is the violence. This is an exceedingly sterile film. Most of the enemies that appear are these synthetic drone robots which, while being interesting, are by definition soulless automatons. They decided very early on that this was going to be somewhat family-friendly (MUCH more so than the original at least), and made it as bloodless and antiseptic as possible, and the ultra-futuristic setting of the film (people using canoes to navigate flooded streets, elevators that spring up and down and left and right like a bizarre level of a video game, and the deus ex machina of The Fall) is all slicker and polished than it should be. Second, and much more importantly, is the distinction between fantasy and reality, which is a major theme not only of this film, but of Dick's body of work in general. Oddly enough, this was something that was taken much more seriously and more efficiently dealt with in the original film, and it's something that this version tries to do justice, but aside from a few moments in a overly dramatic scene with Farrell, Biel, and Farrell's work buddy Harry (played by Bokeem Woodbine), it doesn't quite connect.

As far as performances other than Beckinsale's, whose virtues are dubious but evident, Cranston decides that rather than play a more deliciously ""evil"" villain as Cox did so brilliantly in the original, he plays it straight which is to his strengths as we are aware of him currenly as the brilliant actor that gives Walter White such vivid life, but also have forgotten about the time he spent as the bizarre father on MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE. This is an actor who is not only dramatic but incredibly comic and both strengths could have been played to. Farrell, who has shown incredible range in his roles over the years, plays this very sullen. There is none of the glint in his eye that he showed in pretty much all of his other roles and none of the charm that one needs to carry a big action film. Jessica Biel is still as bland as she has ever been. I've really tried to find roles she's had over the years that can convince me that she has something to bring to the table other than just a sexy body, and it still hasn't happened, and that's also a big reason that there is zero chemistry between the two leads. Bill Nighy is just wasted here.

I know that this is a film that should exist on its own merits, rather than being compared to the original, but that's part of the territory when it comes to a remake; it's either better, worse or on the same level, and despite the lack of anything close to subtlety in Verhoeven's original, that film is eminently watchable and still very lovable for all of its action cliches. Wiseman's version of TOTAL RECALL is only remarkable for its outstanding visual design (which would have worked much better in any other futuristic action film) and its well-orchestrated set pieces, but sadly lacks the spectacle, heart or fun that a big-budget actioner should have.

4764824,3,B005LAII3U,"I saw the Ahnuld version way back when, and liked it a lot. So I had some reservations when the remake came around 20+ years later. Some of them were well justified.

The move from a lifeless Mars to a toxic Earth came across as political, whatever the truth in it. And no one can be Ahnuld except Ahnuld, lately the Governator. Details aside, the freshness was off it - it's been done.

The good news is that every doing is a new doing. An interesting bit of real-world physics brightened for us nerdy types. (freefall through an evacuated tunnel through the earth - shades of college calculus!) The intimate entertainer with the tri-teat specialty benefitted from new makeup technology. Special effects were very special and effective. And, this had Kate Beckinsale. If you ever need a bad mama in charge of a catsuit and some covert urban warfare, hire her. (""I give good wife."" That line is destined to become a classic.) Even with Beckinsale in the cast, Jessica Biel could only improve things, and did.

There was plenty to gripe about, if you're minded to gripe, but that's not what makes me happy. Popcorn-worthy SF, adventure, and catsuits do, so this is a winner in my book.

What truly bothered me was this wasn't a reboot or fresh interpretation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-source-Philip-K-Dick-short-story/dp/0806512091/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the source Philip K.

For a solid sixty-to-seventy percent of the flick, it was a virtual scene-by-scene total rip of the original. They didn't even change the script. Oh, they altered the 'Free Mars' aspect and turned it inward, sure. And the dense CGI cityscapes were very impressive. But making a xerox copy isn't creating art or even entertainment. (Before anyone says it, which would you rather have - the copy or the real thing? I know which I'd choose)

More so given that I thought Colin Farrell and Jessica Biel skillfully executed their roles, providing excellent performances to the production. And, as it happens, I like both actors. But even their energetic and sincere efforts couldn't, and wouldn't, salvage this inferior imitation. There just wasn't enough meat on the bone; not enough for the audience to feel empathy toward or engage as their characters. And most disappointingly, the one aspect I expected to play a huge aspect in the film - Rekall's false memories - didn't play a significant part in the plot at all. Wow.

Sadly, this production is utterly soulless, lacking even the dark comedic touches of the original. I don't think I laughed once during the entire film. Where was the brassy repartee? The twisted joys of Venusville? The snarky one-liners? If they were going to do a rip-off, why neuter the better parts?

It seemed everyone took themselves, especially the director, so seriously.

Reboots are best when filmmakers are inspired by the original, revitalizing the old school with a new school vibe. Giving a fresh coat and a new addition to a well-loved home. Same thing with cover songs. If you're going to do a version - make it *your* version - not do a singalong with a karaoke machine.

Director Len Wiseman didn't create anything - all he did was consume the original and regurgitate. Made more stunning given his incredibly enjoyable work on '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Free-or-Die-Hard/dp/B000VNMMR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live Free or Die Hard</a>'.

Another Michael Cimino? I really hope not.

For comparison's sake, a great example of a proper reboot: The J.J.

An incredible, brilliantly creative and completely fresh take of a story that we all know so well. But despite our familiarity, showcasing the characters by placing them in a brand new perspective; like falling in love with your significant other all over again.

4764918,4,B005LAII3U,"There are interesting and visually stimulating choices director Lein Wiseman (Underworld, Live Free & Die Hard) made for this action adventure Sci-Fi film. Taken originally from the Philip K. Dick short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,"" screenwriters Kurt Wimmer (Salt, Street King) and Mark Bombeck (Race to Witch Mountain, Deception) successfully made a new twist on this remake by making it completely earthbound.

The original film directed by Paul Verheovem of the same name (1990) is considered a cult classic and they chose to keep the premise on Mars and have the ulterior motive be a corporation taking control of the Earth through deception.

 This film takes the current political climate of corporations creating a society of automotons that will rule in a police state manner and only the affluent will benefit entirely and be in charge of society while suppressing the poor and weak. The underlying message to everyone using the fantasy service known as Recall is - they will never know themselves again.

 What shines in this film is the character of Douglass Quaid/Howser who is played extremely passionately by Colin Farrill (Phone Booth, Alexander). His awareness and unawareness is what drives this film. Identity confused and almost not sure who he should believe - including himself - Colin gives an intense performance.

 The two ladies in this film are also amazing. His ""wife"" played by Kate Beckinsale (Aviator, Pearl Harbor) does a great job in being a determined baddie with a mission to stop Colin's character. And Jessica Biel (The Illusionist, New Year's Eve) plays a person who literally saves him from jeopardy several times, confuses him on his very own identity, and eventually makes her way into his heart.

Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Argo) plays an excellent heavy who leads the plot against the suppression of society that no one wants to deal with. On the other side is the short but stunning performance which came from Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter) as the leader of the resistance who I felt came to his demise much too soon.

Some other notable but stand-out performances come from Colin's best friend played by Bookeem Woodbine (The Rock, Ray) and a small but humorous genius administrator at the Recall facility played by John Cho (Star Trek 2009, Harold & Kumar).

 Harry Gregson-Williams (Shrek, Cowboys & Aliens) composed an amazing heart pound score for the extremely entertaining action sequences throughout the film.

 The action sequences involving a very detail magnetic car chase were engaging to the eye. The most amazing feats of stunts and action driven fighting sequences came from an concept where elevators move in all directions at the same time. Making for an amazing chase sequences with fighting, explosions, robots and tons of near misses and hits!

 Overall the film is fun and filled with action. The story is fairly simple and yet there is enough there to make you root for the good guys and cheer when the baddies are lost. Great visual effects, visually dark in nature and stunning city views of the future make it all candy-for-the-eye, including a `lift' that travels through the Earth's crust itself!

 Fun for the whole family with mild language and lots of great action -although not as good as the original film for me - this remake is still really worth seeing.",1345852800,6,3373,5.005366726296959

think Colin Farrell did a better job than Arnold and certainly the two ladies, Kate and Jessica

4764920,5,B005LAII3U,"This movie was amazing.  All the elements of cg, writing, screen-play, cinematography, ""lens flares"", and acting really created something special with this take on Philip K. Dick's story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"". They threw in little details from the original movie as well, sort of a comedic take on it, and then blew you away with the new updated version written by Mark Bomback, James Vanderbilt, and Kurt Wimmer.  I was very impressed with this movie and plan to buy it on blu ray.  One thing to note is the way the writers of this movie really explored extra dimensional space, be it from holograms, or traveling through the center of the earth with zero gravity fighting, to the hover cars and magnetic platforms.  The over-all concept was that of a cube.. and how to transverse 3 dimensions, all while evading overwelming danger.  It was awesome.  They broke through the barriers of mediocrity and developed a beautiful science fiction masterpiece.  Total Recall is a truely exciting action movie, and a very impressive sci-fi.  The acting was superb.  They really did well with every detail, and choosing great actors for even the minor roles was a wise decision.  5 star experience",1344902400,2,1204,4.886699507389163
4764921,5,B005LAII3U,"LOVED it!  The acting is good, the action is non-stop, Colin is eye-candy (as Biel and Beckinsale surely are for the guys). This was a GOOD/EXCITING sci-fi action movie.

[DON'T watch the original before you go see this remake. It could spoil it.]

In the future there only 2 places left to live on Earth: The United Federation of Britain (UFOB), and The Colony (the rest was destroyed by chemical warfare).  Story begins with Colin as a factory worker, married to Beckinsale who is like special military for the UFOB.

Colin has a reoccurring disturbing nightmare where he knows he is part of something big (with Biel) and he gets captured and that's where he always wakes up.  He decides to go to ""Rekall"" to get a good memory so maybe he can stop having this nightmare, and there they discover he's a spy/agent. Immediately, all heck breaks loose and from there the action is pretty much non-stop.

Colin makes it back to his wife and starts to tell her what happened - and discovers she was only pretending to be his wife, (what he thought was his life is a lie) and and now she is trying to kill him.  Beckinsale is awesome as a total unrelenting ""B"" on her ""A-game"" trying to kill him (even though she was ordered to take him alive).  Colin is trying to figure out who he is and what the heck is going on while attempting to stay alive (with some awesome fighting skill of his own), and he runs into Biel and together they fight/run and try to figure things out...  telling you more would probably ruin it, so I won't.

Not an original STORY plot, but it was VERY GOOD ENTERTAINMENT.

I saw this with my 22-yr old nephew and he gives it 4 stars. He did comment that he normally checks his watch a few times when he watches movies, but he realized at the end of this that he had not checked it once.  So now this review is really a 2-fer and both are recommending it as entertaining.

**NOTE TO PARENTS**
There is 1 scene where a hooker tries to solicit Collin by showing her bare breasts (all 3 of them) but that's it for sexual content (unless you count seeing Biel in bikini underpants). The rest is action/violence.  No ""gore"" and very little blood in this - basically just scrapes/cuts - no big deal).

Hope this review helped you.  Hope you enjoy the movie too!",1344729600,3,2272,4.3971291866028706
4764922,4,B005LAII3U,"When I found out that a ""remake/reboot"" was in production, I was pissed. Colin Farrell? And why would they ruin the cult classic that starred Arnold? There are plenty of Philip K.Dick's stories that have not been put to film, (Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, Paycheck, Screamers and the impossible to watch ""Next"" (Nicholas Cage) based on ""The Golden Man"", have been done) that every fan would like to see something else besides another ""Total Recall""(based on Dick's short story, ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"") film. BUT...
It did not disappoint. Len Wiseman directed a good popcorn flick here, paying special attention to great chases and amazing effects in a ""Blade Runner"" (based on Dick's ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"") type future. The cast did a nice job, Farrell (Minority Report) played a good Quaid, and Beckinsale (Underworld) plays the crazed wife particularly well as Lori. Wish there was more of Bryan Cranston (who plays Cohagen.)

There are a few great things in this movie, especially for those interested in DOP (Director of Photography.) The wide shot from left to right as Lori and Cole race along the rooftops, the mirrored elevator scene was well done. Cool weapons and technology; in fashion is the implanted hand phone, face holograms, and the awesome bullet cameras.
I thought the idea of the elevator ""The Fall"" was a pretty cool idea, an immense shaft that travels through the earth and the anti-gravity scenes were nifty and well done.

As a fan of sci-fi genre and Philip K.Dick (author) It's nice to see his works on the screen. Yet, like I said, this is the second Recall film, PKD fans want ""Ubik"", ""Man In The High Castle"" and ""Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said.""

All in all, I was skeptical and came out impressed.",1344729600,2,1770,4.8349834983498345
4764923,3,B005LAII3U,"I kept thinking about the original film while watching this one. To put it simply: Arnold was better than Colin Farrell. Kate Beckinsale in the expanded role is better than Sharon Stone, and I really love them both. Jessica Biel is better than anyone, if you don't believe me, ask her. What I really liked about this film is the updated special effects, down to the electronic notes on the refrigerator door. I love attention to detail.

The action was fast paced. The future looks similar to ""The Fifth Element"" but with more computer gizmos. If you have seen the original version, then you can miss the first few minutes of this one and be able to pick it up.

For some reason they eliminated all the fun aspects of going to Mars. That is why we watched the first film. Instead we get a film where we simply root for the terrorists. The terrorists are revolting against the Chancellor who wants to replace workers with synthetics, although this theme was poorly developed.

One of the aspects of both productions that I didn't like was the initial dream sequence. Had they eliminated that from both films, then the genius of the script would have been the ambiguity of reality vs. the recall machine.

The film included 3D holograms, Star Wars stormtroopers, Bill Nighy for a brief moment, and an inadvertent mention of an old film ""Hauser's Memory.""

What I didn't like about this film was all the action. It didn't have drama scenes outside of the beginning. No colorful characters. No time for a Biel/ Farrell love scene. It was like watching someone play a video game. Seriously, where was the writing? The clever lines? The complex character? The relationship? Any moron can write ""Bang bang, run shoot, bang, chase, shoot, bang.""

Parental Guide: F-Bomb, Nudity (Kaitlyn Leeb wearing a fake chest) no sex. 3 stars is pushing it. Can't wait for the video game.",1344729600,99,1867,4.729230769230769

I don't know why the bad reviews, I walked out of the theater texting a friend the exact title of this review. Good old-fashioned action movie with beautiful modern effects. Why do people complain about eye candy? Just because there's lots of it doesn't mean that's all there is! The story is still there, virtually unchanged (thank you for the hooker with 3 tits and the woman at customs who says 'two weeks' from the original!) I thought the acting was great, not that there was a whole lot of it, too busy shooting at each other! In fact, most of the story/character development took place mid-combat, but it was still there. Kate Beckinsale dogged Colin Farrell almost two solid hours in one long chase scene that managed to never get boring (10 points for originality in the zero-G gunfight). Another reviewer complains about Kate throwing Colin around like a rag-doll when he is supposed to be a better trained agent of twice her size and strength...yea there's two reasons for that: 1 - People want to see it. 2 - He is hesitant to kill her because the last thing he knew, she was his beloved wife! He is much more defending himself than really trying to take her down. Yes he shoots at her but its much easier (emotionally and physically) to shoot someone than to kill them with your bare hands, even if you know how. I saw this as part of his character development. He is not a bad guy, he's just trying to figure out WTF is going on. When he finally decides to kill her, its over pretty quickly.

Again, TOTALLY AWESOME, best pure action movie since the era of the original.",1344643200,5,1600,4.5137931034482754
4764925,3,B005LAII3U,"""Total Recall"" (2012), a reasonably entertaining but forgettable remake of the 1990 film, seems destined to be compared to the predecessor starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. As to the differences between two versions, I only say that there is much less humor in the new version than in Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi classic. You will see no Johnny Cab, one of the most memorable taxi drivers in the movie history. What you get instead is a more straightforward sci-fi action directed by Len Wiseman.

The plotline itself is basically the same. Colin Farrell is a factory worker Douglas Quaid, living with his beautiful wife Lori (Kate Beckinsale). Fed up with the monotonous life, Doug visits a memory implanting company ""Rekall,"" where he discovers a few unsettling secrets about himself.

I hate it when a film begins with a long, expository pre-credit text like ""In the year 2525,"" especially when it is unconvincing and boring. The 2012 ""Total Recall"" opens with such a text explaining that by the end of this century, the only habitable places for humans are the ""United Federation of Britain"" and ""The Colony"" (today's Australia). The two areas are connected by a massive elevator called ""The Fall."" So, humans can build a gravity elevator traveling through the Earth's core, but cannot cleanse the contaminated soil.

Len Wiseman's new ""Total Recall"" may look great with the cutting-edge visual effects, but its ideas are badly assorted. The story is dull with a few lapses in logic and Colin Farrell's uninteresting protagonist Douglas Quaid. Villains lack charisma. Each action set-piece is slick, but short on imagination. Hovercars may look real, but the action and the city always remind us of other sci-fi films like ""Blade Runner"" and ""Minority Report"" (both based on P. K. Dick stories).

""Total Recall"" is a serviceable action film, but is much tamer and less unique than you might want it to be.",1344556800,2,1903,5.050955414012739
4764926,3,B005LAII3U,"The original 1990 version of ""Total Recall"" was released at the height of Arnold Schwartzenegger's career and popularity. Despite its many flaws, the movie, loosely based on Philip K. Dick's ""We Can Remember it for You Wholesale"", was a smash hit and is still a respected action science fiction movie. For the most part, it was because of its storyline, but I would say that it is also because of the charisma of its star and the loosey-goosey have some fun direction of Paul Verhoeven.

 Verhoeven brought that same fun to other action science fiction movies like ""Robo Cop"", ""Starship Troopers"" and (not action sci-fi, but) ""Basic Instinct"". Bottom line, Verhoeven was a master at what audiences wanted to see. He wasn't particularly critically heralded, but audiences loved his violence, seediness and the personality he brought to the characters.

 In a way, ""Total Recall"" maybe deserved a remake. In 1990, the technology available was nowhere near what we have today. Most of the effects were silly and cheap looking. The new version of ""Total Recall"" has effects and action in spades. If there is one thing that director Len Wiseman is really good at, it's putting together amazing action sequences, and ""Recall"" 2012 maybe his best work to date, in that aspect. The synthetic humanoid army that marches through ""Recall"" 2012 put George Lucas' clone army to shame.

 Another thing to note is the outstanding performance by Wiseman's wife, Kate Beckinsale, who plays Lori Quaid, a part played by Sharon Stone in the original. She sinks her teeth into the sweet loving wife and ruthless assassin character with charisma and athletics. She is one of the most believable parts of the movie.

 Unfortunately though, that same charisma and fun that Schwartzenegger brought to the original are completely absent in the remake. Schwartzenegger has never been known as a great actor, but he never failed to bring personality to his characters. No matter what silly line he was uttering, you were with him in his ventures. Colin Farrell, who plays the part in the remake is completely void of anything other than, `look how good-looking and cool I look.'

 It is a hard pill to swallow, getting past the lack of any sort of deepness from Farrell. He basically wears the same reaction and emotion throughout the entire movie, despite changing characters twice and going through numerous life realizations. That aside, ""Total Recall"" 2012 has been giving a technology overhaul and may be one of Wiseman's best action movies yet. Unfortunately for him though, the movie will probably fall into ho-hum land due to lead actor who couldn't bring the audience to think anything about him one way or the other.",1344556800,,2699,4.977777777777778
4764927,3,B005LAII3U,"""Total Recall"" with Colin Farrell is more a remake of the 1990 Arnold Schwarnegger version than the Philip K. Dick short story, ""We Can Remember it for you Wholesale,"" and from there, there are a mixture of influences, the world in this ""Recall"" is clearly the ""Blade Runner"" world of Ridley Scott and weirdly enough there seem to be influences of ""Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.""

This Recall focuses more on action, which has a scene in which Farrell and Beckinsale jump several floors of space, crash through numerous windows and land on what looks like very hard concrete slabs all without breaking any arms, legs or ribs. There are also car chases and elevator chases (the Star Wars influence as well as the very disposable synthetic police force).

Both movies share with the story ""We Can Remember it for you Wholesale"" what they share with the story is that disgruntled factory worker drudge Douglas Quade longs for a more meaningful, adventure laden life and he is offered the chance to live out his dreams at Total Rekall, a sort of travel agency that will let you live out those fantasies and you will experience them as real and happening to you. After Quade is hooked up to the dream machine something goes drastically wrong when it's discovered Quade really was a spy, that's about where Philip K. Dick left it, from there on in the Schwarzenegger version takes over and everybody is trying to kill Quade, who as time goes on is remembering more about who he was and who he is. Both movies mess with your head with challenging Quade's sense of reality and what is really real and depending on who you believe in the movie(s) Quade is either a spy that was turned to the rebel's cause, or it was all an elaborate plan to let the resistance think Quade had turned in able to track down the resistance leader Matthias and expose and kill him.

It's good to see Colin Farrell seeming to make a full revival of his career after the brief part in ""Crazy Heart"" in 2009 he seems back in full strength in ""Total Recall"" as Quade, he's easily a better actor than Schwarzenegger and in the few scenes where he acts (as opposed to being chased or shot at) they are very satisfying moments and you believe his angst at not knowing who he really is. Kate Beckinsale plays Quade's wife, Lori, and is a lot more predatory and persistent than Sharon Stone was in the same role in the 1990 version. Bryan Cranston as Cohaagen is good at channeling his dark side playing a ruthless politician manipulating everyone, especially the public in order to justify an invasion. And Jessica Biel as Melina, Quade's true love that showed him the truth of the resistance, doesn't seem to generate any real heat or chemistry in her relationship with Quade.

The 1990 version of ""Total Recall"" messes with your head more, while this version the special effects far outshine what was possible in 1990. Which did I like better? It's a coin flip but I lean more towards the 1990 version, but still if you want to have a pleasant evening of watching the movie on DVD or Blu-Ray you'll enjoy it and maybe they'll put some cool behind the scenes features on the DVD/Blu-Ray version. Because this ""Total Recall"" follows the 1990 version so closely I'm left with the same conclusion as Roger Ebert, that while this was an entertaining, enjoyable movie, was it really necessary to remake it?",1344384000,31,3367,4.625418060200669
4764968,4,B005LAII3U,"First off, ignore the 1 star reviews.  That just smacks of misguided and disappointed expectation and isn't a fair critique of this film.  Secondly, for folks who enjoyed movies such as ""Blade Runner"", ""Minority Report"", ""Equilibrium"", and even ""I, Robot"" you're in the same ballpark here and should enjoy this film (and, no, of course it isn't nearly as good as ""Blade Runner"" but there isn't much that is).

While the original Recall was a gonzo Ahunuld vehicle full of mean-spirited violence, neon trash character riff raff, and brilliant flip-you-on-your-head storytelling (yes, I think the 1990 Recall is a more enjoyable movie than this one--5 stars on it) this new Farrell, Beckinsale, and Biel vehicle is a more straightforward and grounded dystopian future action flick.  It doesn't want to be a rehash of the original and it's not trying to quite be an updated photocopy either but it does give some nice nods to the 1990 version (the tri-breasted woman makes an appearance; a hologram scrambler doesn't quite help get Quaid past transport security) while maintaining a similar storyline and it also has some nice touches of its own (like early in the film when we see Quaid reading a copy of Ian Fleming's ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" not yet knowing that he himself is a double-agent or that his wife too is an agent).

The beginning of the film gives us an all-too-brief history lesson bringing us up to the dismal present and then the film starts us off proper by by reorienting our disoriented perspective when we see Farrell's Quaid in close-up appearing to be in a buried alive situation only to have the camera rotate over and pull back to show us a frantic Quaid laying belly down on the floor.  I'm going to leave it there and not spoil more but I will admit that there are a few little details that the film slyly highlights well enough to allow the intelligent adult viewer to fairly easily follow the narrative and get the plot the first time through without any real hangups (I don't recall the original movie letting us get away with that).  Also, even as Hollywood so often does in making use of cheap ploys by throwing us macguffins and red herrings that are there merely to confuse and disorient us, I appreciate that this movie remains constrained.  It allows the initial plot point of a submerged double identity coming back to the fore to be the real and honest disorientation, which is enough for us to experience without the extra contrivances that could have been pulled in just to leave us dazed and confused and going ""whoa...uh, what?""  Thankfully this movie doesn't bend us in that direction.

As for the actors, Farrell's Quaid/ Hauser is a muted and quiet hero here.  He is full of physical action but he isn't overimposing.  Beckinsale, on the other hand, is hotcha!!!  Yowza!!!  She is a treat to watch and an extremely awesome action actress.  She is really great as a determined bad/ good guy in this film.  This movie is at its best when she and Farrell share the screen.  Our other significant female lead, Jessica Biel, plays Melina who is one of the resistance's leads.  Biel, who is herself strikingly beautiful, has her stunning attractiveness dirtied out (sorry, guys).  Bill Nighy makes a rather inconsequential appearance as the resistance's leader, Bokeem Woodbine plays Farrell's undercover co-worker, and Bryan Cranston rounds out the cast as the power-mad Cohaagen (Cransten, a superb actor, has his talents wasted here).  One of the film's most glaring failings is that we are not given any real substance as to why Cohaagen wants to take over and essentially dispose of a certain population area other than a generic ""it's class warfare"" explanation that really doesn't fit in the scheme of this film given what's going on with the earth.

Still, it was an enjoyable ride.  Don't let the negative reviews mess with your mind.  Take the trip.",1344211200,,3894,4.805097451274363

This one was high action from the minute Colin sat in the chair at Rekall.  The CGI was totally awesome--very futuristic and very creative. The multi-level housing structures suspended across the overcrowded city -- Lots of fighting, running, chasing.  Nifty hover cars on multi-level roadways.  Well worth seeing and owning.

4764971,5,B005LAII3U,"""Total Recall"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: Welcome to Rekall, the company that can turn your dreams into real memories. For a factory worker named Douglas Quaid, even though he's got a beautiful wife who he loves, the mind-trip sounds like the perfect vacation from his frustrating life - real memories of life as a super-spy might be just what he needs. But when the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man. Finding himself on the run from the police -controlled by Chancellor Cohaagen, the leader of the free world, Quaid teams up with a rebel fighter to find the head of the underground resistance and stop Cohaagen. The line between fantasy and reality gets blurred and the fate of his world hangs in the balance as Quaid discovers his true identity, his true love, and his true fate.

The cast led by Colin Farrell (as Douglas Quaid), Kate Beckinsale (as Lori), Jessica Biel (as Melina) & Bryan Cranston (as Cohaagen) is pretty good. The directing by Len Wiseman is pretty good. The screen story (inspired on or based on the short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"" by Philip K. Dick) by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon, Jon Povill & Kurt Wimmer & screenplay (inspired on or based on the short story ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale"") by Wimmer & Mark Bomback is pretty good.

The music by Harry Gregson-Williams is pretty good. The cinematography by Paul Cameron is pretty good. The film editing by Christian Wagner is pretty good. The casting by Debra Zane is pretty good. The production design by Patrick Tatopoulos is pretty good. The art direction by Patrick Banister, Oana Bogdan & Brandt Gordon is pretty good. The set decoration by Carolyn 'Cal' Loucks, set design by William Cheng, Tucker Doherty, David G. Fremlin, Vladislav Fyodorov, Sorin Popescu, Anshuman Prasad & Douglas Slater, set dressings by Matt Wladyka & Toni Wong is pretty good. The costume design by Sanja Milkovic Hays is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Andy Gill, Spiro Razatos, John Stoneham Jr., Regan Moore, J.J. Perry, Jude Poyer & Brad Martin is pretty good. The fights coordinated by Jeff Imada & John Koyama is pretty good. The special make-up effects by Kazuhiro Tsuji is pretty good. The prosthetic make-up effects by Jamie Kelman & Sean Sansom is pretty good. The special effects supervised by Laird McMurray, Shane Mahan & Clay Pinney & coordinated by Lindsay MacGowan & John Rosengrant is pretty good.

This is a pretty decently good remake that differs from the original and is not a shot-by-shot retread. This is a well-designed film, visually and artistically. Colin Farrell is a pretty good pick for the role of Douglas Quaid, which was originated by Arnold Schwarzenegger, 22 years previously. As is, Kate Beckinsale & Jessica Biel, replacing Sharon Stone & Rachel Ticotin in the original, 22 years ago. Len Wiseman is also an interesting choice to direct the remake, replacing Paul Verhoeven, 22 years ago, of course.",1344124800,,3446,5.010471204188482
4764972,5,B005LAII3U,"I wasn't looking forward to this film since I'm a big fan of the original.  I was actually the only one in the theatre.  Sitting there brought back memories of the 80's when I watched The Thing and Blade Runner alone.  Those films became classics and while I can't say this film will I still enjoyed it.  Wiseman is a visual director and I've been a fan of his from the beginning.  Total Recall is a stunning looking film and very action packed.  It would be wrong to call this a remake but a new interpretation.  It does pay homage to the original which was nice to see.  There's also some humour to be found although it's rare.  Kate does a great job as usual because as you know ""she gives good wife"".  It's too bad this film won't make a lot of money but then some great films don't.  Take a chance you just may like it.",1344124800,,824,4.151898734177215
4764973,3,B005LAII3U,"Total Recall from 1990 was cheesy action done right. It took place mostly on Mars, had lots of bad lines (which makes them classic when said by Arnold), a huge and gory body count, mutants, a three breasted hooker and it had enough smarts to keep you guessing until the end.

This 2012 version stays on this planet, has some good action, decent CGI and not a whole lot else worth remembering. Oh, it does have a brief shot of a three breasted chick, but that was done over two decades ago. Well, Kate Beckinsale looked good as the ""wife"" turned villain (the most memorable role in the film) and Jessica Biel looked yummy too, but that's to be expected. Colin Farrell doesn't do a bad job replacing Arnold, but he doesn't add a whole lot either.

Worth a rental if you want mindless wall to wall action. You'll probably like it more if you have never seen the original.",1344038400,3,868,4.41875
4764974,3,B005LAII3U,"Remaking a classic film (even if it's only a cult classic) can be a strange business: if it isn't broke, why fix it?  That's the logic that applies to the newest iteration of Arnold Schwarzenegger's sci-fi classic, ""Total Recall.""

During the twenty second century in the aftermath of a devastating chemical war, the two remaining nations on earth exist in an uneasy state of underground warfare and terrorism.  Among it all, factory worker Douglas Quaid seeks to find meaning in his boring, tedious life.  Desiring to obtain some artificial memories of a more exciting life, Quaid quickly finds himself thrust into a world of war, intrigue, and where nothing is as it seems.

What really sets this modern ""Recall"" apart from the original is that it features a more serious, gritty approach to the nearly-identical storyline (which means no witty one liners, trips to Mars, or mutated belly-aliens).  And yet, that's not a bad thing, as it makes for a unique telling of the story, complete with a few welcome changes (Quaid's wife gets a much bigger role, and I found the idea of two continents connected by a massive elevator very interesting).  The production design is also fantastic, combining the visual look of Minority report, the Fifth Element, and Blade Runner, with lots of futuristic tech filling the screen, and delighting the eyes.

Still, for all its visual powers, ""Recall"" doesn't feel like it has much weight to it: it's mainly an action movie, with the fascinating ""Who am I?"" plot playing second fiddle.  Most of the film is devoted to seemingly endless chase scenes among futuristic grey buildings and streets, with almost no humor or moments of levity, which gives the impression that the film takes itself a little too seriously.

In the end, ""Total Recall"" is a good example of a middle of the road remake.  It does distinguish itself from what came before with a more serious tone, superb visuals, and a very creative climax.  While not a classic, it's serviceable, and an interesting take on the original classic.",1344038400,,2038,4.909620991253644
4764975,3,B005LAII3U,"I almost went back to take another look at the 1990's version, but I'm glad I didn't.  There are a couple things that are big distinctions between the two.  First, this new iteration eschews the going to Mars thing and relies more on the Phillip K. Dick short story, ""We Can Remember It for You Wholesale.""  Second, the main character of Douglas Quaid is played by a real actor (Colin Farrell) vs. the original played by body builder/investor/politician Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Without getting into too many comparisons between the two films, certainly the Arnold version had wit along with the campy feel.  This new version lacks both and to some extent, to its detriment.

In this dystopian world of the late 21st century, Earth is left with 2 inhabitable civilizations.  Based on a map briefly displayed in the film the world's one-percenters live in an area known as the United Federation of Britain comprised of the U. K. and parts of northern Europe.  Everyone else lives in the Colony (the former Australia).  One of the nice things about the movie is the visualization of this world, straight out of Ridley Scott's masterpiece ""Blade Runner"" which of course was also written by Dick.  It is here where much of the action takes place.  And action there is.

Quaid is a worker on an assembly line making robots at the UFB and commutes daily via The Fall which appears to be a giant subway that gets from the Colony to UFB in a matter of minutes by short cutting through the middle of the planet.  Cool.  Midway on this ride, the transport does some kind of back-flip which causes a zero gravity state.  That comes into play late in the film.  Also cool.  Quaid's wife is played by everyone's favorite-in-black-leather, Kate Beckinsale (also director Len Wiseman's wife).  She stays around much longer than poor Sharon Stone did with Arnie in the original.

Out of boredom, Quaid decides to take a shot at a mind altering memory process called Rekall (not a typo).  This interupted experiment brings him to a conscious state where he now has the fighting ability of a trained military agent.  He also now is being hunted by the bad guys headed by Cohaagen (Bryan Cranston), the head of UFB.  Cohaagen is close to unleashing an army of robotic soldiers to cleanse the Colony of the unwashed.  Quaid is assisted by Melina (Jessica Biel), his one time lover.  Unfortunately he doesn't remember her.  Melina and Kate get it on, uh...fighting scenes, a couple times which is... meh.

In addition to the lack of humor, ""Total Recall"" (2012) also lacks the chemistry between the characters to give it much depth.  In the aforementioned ""Blade Runner,"" the main characters are given time to connect and build an understanding even between enemies.  Here, there is no attempt.  Instead that time is given to 2 or 3 excellent, if too long, chase sequences.  In short this is a visually excellent sci-fi thriller with plenty of cool toys (love the built-in hand phone) and lots of action.  And if you're wondering about the 3-breasted prostitute in the original, she shows up here too with a fleeting peek-a-boob in keeping with the PG-13 rating.",1344038400,2,3140,4.791433891992551
4764976,1,B005LAII3U,"The acting was mediocre. In one scene I even felt an actor was having difficulty with his lines and that's annoying! What's even more annoying is that the main ""bad guy"" is a depraved, Teflon-coated, wonder woman who can easily beat the stuffing out of our hero, despite the fact he also happens to be a professionally trained killer with muscles the size of bowling balls. Throughout the entire movie, this wonder woman just keeps coming back like a pesty stalker. Hardly getting a scratch until the very end. I was even waiting for her to start talking like Clint Eastwood! She also enjoyed explaining herself too much and I was really hoping she would get dispatched ASAP because her presence was undermining the entire story!

I have to admit I cared about the good guys! I wanted them to win, but unlike the first Total Recall, I didn't care nearly as much. In the original film I desperately wanted the good guys to win! In the remake my feelings were muted. After all the remake has been dumbed-down, which makes it dull. Sure there's plenty of CGI eye candy and plenty of Clone Trooper-type guys in body armor getting miraculously mowed down at every corner. But the story is not edgy in the least! Unlike the original Total Recall, where you really didn't know if the good guys were going to win.

And the remake has no message, unlike the original. The original was about mind-bogglingly oppressive corporate greed and as a result you felt a wide range of strong emotions! So much was a stake!

I don't like it when a great story is reduced to so many campy cliches! There was great tension building in the first half of the film only to fall apart later! It's so obvious Hollywood focus-grouped the screenplay to death in order to pander to the teen and pre-teen boy segment of the movie going public! Too bad Philip K. Dick will be spinning in his grave tonight. Whoever owns the film rights to his stories should be ashamed of themselves and PLEASE make no more movies if this is the best you can do! Try to protect the man's legacy, instead!
