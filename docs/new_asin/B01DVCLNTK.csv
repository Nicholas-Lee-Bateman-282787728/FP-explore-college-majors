8756990,1,B01DVCLNTK,"An underground world made of wooden pallet like tunnels. Unusually small tunnels. You'd think that in the process of building an underground world to escape the heat of the surface apocalypse (Earth moving to close to the Sun apparently); you'd at least make tunnels you could walk through. But nah, we'll make them smaller so you gotta crawl. Oh and we'll have futuristic juvenile mini go-karts to cruise through the tunnels on too. And despite the tunnels being so ridiculously small and the anti-hero facing a few adversaries at point blank range inside a terribly confined space; he still manages to miss 95% of his shots with his little futuristic gun. And when his girl is being dragged away, he can't seem to follow or keep up. Like... it's a tunnel dude. She's being dragged away just as fast as you can walk. So um... for a bad ass soldier that's supposed to be feared by the entire underground you're pretty worthless. Also, he's ""imprisoned"" in a pallet room he can't seem to escape; yet you can see the wooden pallets walls are so thin they wouldn't trap a group of pre-school misfits.

But those are just a few of the nonsensical annoyances you scratch your head at. But that's the movie. One big head scratcher of a WTF am I watching kinda thing. I like low-budget B-Movies. I've seen some terrible movies that are absolutely worth watching 'cuz there's something entertaining about them. A uniqueness. This... set a new standard for crap. The plot is simple. The story line, the dialogue, the action, the drama, the acting and everything else is just f'n ridiculous. Like, WTF kind of ridiculous.",1508716800,,1611,4.753571428571429

8756994,1,B01DVCLNTK,"This is the worst film it has been my displeasure to have seen. I would rip out my own eyes, but it is too late. The memory of this horrible film is burned into my mind and it slowly plays  the movie every time I close my eyes. It haunts my dreams with the horrid nature of this pallet lined disaster of a film. It has become a living nightmare of bad filmmaking. Unfortunately it can never be unseen once you have watched it. I even die a little every time I think about how horrific this film is. I can never see a pallet the same way ever again.",1479686400,3,548,3.981818181818182
