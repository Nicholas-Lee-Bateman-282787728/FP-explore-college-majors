8534686,5,B00928OHIC,"When it comes to campy summer camp films, Odd Balls is in a league all by it self.  That doesn't mean it's original, actually it's the opposite and rips off every other summer camp movie of it's time...and it's awful...and I DO mean awful! (Every single gag is immediately followed by quirky sound effects that you would find in a road runner cartoon.)  But it's one of the awful movies that's also strangely addictive...kind of like the smell of your own ear wax.  I will say the one scene that did make me laugh out loud was when the camp's owner Mr. Basset (played by the late great Foster Brooks) sold the camp to some rich goofball, he is met with everyone in the camp glowering back at him....including his breakfast! (sausage lips, egg over easy eyes, etc...)  So my hope is that Odd Balls will one day be available on DVD....perhaps a special edition with the packaging shaped like a breakfast plate with a face made from egg eyes and sausage lips.",1350432000,,956,4.508670520231214
