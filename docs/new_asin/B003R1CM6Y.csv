4175555,5,B003R1CM6Y,"This is such a bargain and they are great little stories.  If you read the Richard Scarry books you'll recognize the story lines.  You get 3 DVDs in this package, so it's a real steal.  My three year old loves them!",1289952000,,215,4.195121951219512

I purchased this DVD and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Busy-World-of-Richard-Scarry-It-s-a-Busy-Busy-Day/dp/B003R2BWHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Busy World of Richard Scarry: It's a Busy, Busy Day!</a>&nbsp;for my younger cousin.  When I received them both, I realized that Every Day There's Something New has all of the episodes from It's a Busy, Busy Day and an additional 20 episodes.  Basically, don't buy It's a Busy, Busy Day.  For an extra couple of dollars you could get 30 full episodes instead of 10. By the way, these are the original Richard Scarry cartoons, not the new Busytown Mysteries cartoons.",1289174400,51,751,6.252427184466019
4175557,5,B003R1CM6Y,"As a parent I have struggled with young children's television programming.  Too often, shows that cater to children are not child appropriate (mild sexual innuendo, crude joking, and parents are always idiotic and usually wrong).  I am happy to say that I have found a show that I approve of.

The Busy World of Richard Scarry: Everyday There's Something New is a pleasant relief for parents.  Not only is this series free of all that is bad about modern children's television (think Rugrats and Spongebob), but it even has better animation.

This July 2010 DVD release consists of 3 DVDs with approximately 13.5 hours of video.

It's a great buy!",1285113600,23,647,4.836363636363636
4175558,5,B003R1CM6Y,"What a very imformative cartoon this was. I watched it as a kid and loved it and now that I have it on DVD I can share it with my nieces. I am very impressed with this DVD. 30 episodes on 3 dvds, the show has 65 episodes so we now have half the show. Please Cookie Jar and Mill Creek, release the rest of this awesome cartoon! I will be sure to buy. Thanks for releasing this",1283299200,10,375,3.8205128205128207
4175559,5,B003R1CM6Y,"This is a compilation (3 dvd set) of Richard Scarry stories originally produced, I believe, in the 1990s. Until this came out, those stories were mainly available on VHS. We have a large collection of the VHS tapes, however I was happy to discover many new stories on this set that we had not seen before.  Although the animation is not cutting edge computer-generated, it is easy to watch and much more detailed than then new Hurray for Huckle dvds.  The stories seem to have been written and animated by people who enjoyed what they were doing. The stories are widely varied, some taking place in other countries (Japan, Chile, Switzerland, Germany, etc.) and times (Shakespeare, Gutenberg, etc.).  The dialogues are clever. The plots are wholesome. Only borderline exception would be a couple of stories that feature Couscous the detective dressing up as a dancing girl in order to capture Peppy the Gangster.  (We also skip some of the previews at the beginning of the dvds.) Between the stories are catchy songs that teach about crossing the street, being careful with electricity, swimming pool safety, etc. The age range that these appeal to is wide: our now 3 yr old and 1 year old love them and their 5 yr old and 10 yr old cousins still enjoyed watching when they came to visit. In fact they're fairly entertaining for my husband and I, even after a zillion viewings.",1283126400,50,1377,4.7489539748953975

4175583,4,B003R1CM6Y,"Busytown DVD's are my children's favorites. The only reasons for withholding 5 stars are: 1) I don't think ghost stories are appropriate for small children, and 2) video quality is not great on some segments, even on a non-HD TV. I was really surprised by the shoddy video quality of some of the segments, though most were acceptable.",1419638400,,334,4.775862068965517

4175588,4,B003R1CM6Y,"While the original Richard Scarry Busytown has the same concept of being educational, its just not as educational for the children who watch it compared to the newer version.

4175600,5,B003R1CM6Y,"I simply love The Busy World of Richard Scarry. I remember watching it in the 1990s when it originally aired. I also remember re-runs on television from 2008 to 2009. Now with this complete set (and the other set, Fun in Busytown) I can watch it over and over again. The show is wonderful! There is no discrimination, no violence, no hatred, simply love, joy, and peace. There are many valuable lessons that the show communicates, such as how to cross the street and what to do in an emergency. I also grew up with the original Richard Scarry books, and they too are delightful! It saddens me that shows like this are not made anymore. It seems that back in the 1990s animation was better and shows like this were treasures. You certainly do not get that now, and today's youth do not appreciate shows like this. I love Busytown and its characters because they make me happy; they reassure me that life is indeed good and remind me to keep going in the midst of difficulty. Bottom line: The Busy World of Richard Scarry: Every Day There's Something New! is the best EVER! You won't be disappointed!",1343088000,,1098,4.522613065326633

4175602,5,B003R1CM6Y,This DVD set got great reviews and rightly so.  My son loves it and would watch it every day if we let him.  He loves all the characters and Goldbug so it was a great deal at $9.  A great value for so many episodes.  Highly recommended.,1311811200,,236,3.9574468085106385
4175603,5,B003R1CM6Y,"Wow, this was a fabulous deal! 33 episodes! My 3 yr. old LOVES watching them. With so many different episodes, he doesn't get tired of the same ones.  And it's a wonderful gift for little kids! We have the amazon prime, so the total price we pay is less than ten dollars with free two day shipping! You can't get much better than that! A DVD like this at a big box store would easily sell for over $40. because there are **33** episodes!! This is a steal for the price and it's quite enjoyable to watch and absolutely not obnoxious the way other cartoons are.  My 3 yr. old relaxes when he watches it.",1307923200,,601,4.217391304347826
4175604,5,B003R1CM6Y,"I wasn't but 4 when I start watching The Busy World of Richard Scarry. And I love it. It was one of my all-time favorite animated series from the 1990s. I was extremely surprised when I ran in to this 3 Disc DVD set right here on Amazon and I had manage purchased it last year. This has only 30 episodes. That's half of the show I got for my collection. There's another DVD set going to be release on July 19, 2011. The DVD title is called ""Fun in Busytown"". It contains 35 episodes. That's the other half of the series. I recently find it right here on Amazon earilier this week. To be perfectly honest, I been praying for this DVD set to be released. And now it's finally answered. I'm really looking forward in getting it. And the only thing that I want to say about Cookie Jar and Mill Creek Enterainment is I'm extremely grateful for bringing this series to DVD and memories back.",1307750400,,885,4.273809523809524
4175605,5,B003R1CM6Y,"10 stars if I could. The content of these 'old school' cartoons are so wonderful, with excellent lessons to teach young children, unlike a lot of new cartoons which are full of garbage. My son actually was addicted to watching Busytown Mysteries (newer cartoon) but upon a search I found more DVDs so I jumped and bought it! Am so happy with this 3 disc set! :o) Oh and my one year old also loves it!",1306195200,3,400,4.276315789473684

4175608,5,B003R1CM6Y,"I teach K-2 special education students and they can't get enough of this series! My students sometimes need a little break between challenging lessons but I hate putting them in front of a TV to watch something with no educational value. Busytown became an instant favorite for both me and the kids. The episodes all teach a lesson (crossing the street safely, stay away from fire, never try to cook alone in the kitchen) which are life lessons my special education students desperately need. I also like that each 30 minute episode has 3-4 little stories so I can put on just 1 or 2 if we have an extra 10 minutes at the end of the day.",1296000000,3,637,4.406779661016949

8403018,1,B003R1CM6Y,The Paramount logo does NOT belong in the opening sequence. They should remove the Paramount logo in the opening sequence.
