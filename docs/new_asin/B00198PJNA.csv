3425013,3,B00198PJNA,I ordered this set as a surprise for my wife and was surprised myself when I found out it was the same set I had ordered last year but with a new cover and description. Oh Well!,1265414400,5,177,3.810810810810811
3425014,5,B00198PJNA,"For the price of $13 getting 21 hours of classic holiday TV viewing is pretty good.  Yeah, one could complain that the mostly B/W shows are hazy and grainy and sometime skip, though I kind of take that as being part of the charm of this wonderful collection.  Since I was born in 1957 I only had some vague memories of some of these shows... some I never even heard of!  In particular, I enjoyed the 5 Christmas episodes of ""Ozzie & Harriet"" and all jokes aside, I can really see WHY this was such a popular show for so many years, I mean who wouldn't want to have them as your parents! (Plus David and Ricky - those lips! - are HOT! LOL and in some of the shows you hear Ricky sing, and no doubt gave Elvis a run for his money back then?)  I also enjoyed the two Liberace programs (Thanksgiving and Christmas) along with the Betty White (pre-'Golden Girls') sitcom.  And you also get a virtual fireplace - so it loops ever 5 minutes! LOL... what's even more funny is that if you turn up the volume of the fireplace segment and listen carefully you can hear a dog barking throughout very faintly! LOL  So this is fun collection... And I look forward to their doing a followup collection soon.",1261008000,2,1192,4.299107142857143
3425015,1,B00198PJNA,This dvd set did not play at all.  I was very disappointed.  We tried the dvds in several players and it just would not show a picture.,1260921600,4,135,3.962962962962963
3425016,2,B00198PJNA,"While the cover here clearly shows 51 episodes, the disc I received only had 48 episodes. The image quality is HORRIBLE. There was absolutley no attempt to clean up the film, which is a real shame. At one point, my Robin Hood Christmas Goose episode showed words across the screen that said something to the effect of adjusting calibration. (Uh, this is a dvd, no adjusting of VHS on my end!) As for the sound, the voice track was good.",1257379200,17,436,4.4625
3425017,4,B00198PJNA,There are so many episodes on this DVD we still haven't seen them all.  If you grew up in the 50's and 60's you will remember some of these shows and commercials.  We really enjoyed taking a little step back in time. The video quality of some of these episodes is a little rough or I would have given it 5 stars.,1232236800,43,312,4.016129032258065
3425018,5,B00198PJNA,"Excellent Xmas Compilation. My copy had defects, but Mill Creek fixed it right away. They were great! So is Amazon.",1231372800,,115,4.8
3425019,4,B00198PJNA,There is a a much smaller compilation (5 or 6 episodes) for a few dollars less. This compilation includes 51 episodes and most of them look pretty good. The only thing that I have noticed with MIll Creek is their DVD's always cause vibration in your machine. Some more than others like a laptop are notebook will vibrate quite violently while other players it's hardly noticeable. If you have ever had a MIll Creek compilation that won't play even after thoroughly cleaning the disc you can bet it has something to do with the disc or labels causing the player to vibrate.,1230940800,2,572,4.617647058823529
3425020,4,B00198PJNA,"This Holiday DVD was perfect for us.  We ordered a copy for another family member also.  True, most of the episodes are in black and white but that just adds to the charm!  We would recommend this for anyone who remembers the ""good old days!""  Our grandkids enjoy it too, they are fascinated by the way commercials were worked right into the script!",1229472000,,349,4.492063492063492

3425022,5,B00198PJNA,"This is a 4-disc set of 50's and early 60's era TV sit-coms, variety and drama for the Christmas season. An added bonus is a link on Disc One for a Virtual Fireplace that you can keep on the screen while listening to music,wrapping presents, trimming the tree, etc. Cozy.
This set is one of the best values I have seen anywhere for the price. Unbeatable. Curious that some reviewers are complaining about audio/video discrepancies.  I have played through all of the discs several times and could not see or hear anything out of the ordinary.  They are all in black and white, common in 50's TV, some shows are a little creaky, production-wise, but all the more charming, seeing these early TV holiday shows with a few creaks make them even more enjoyable.
Contents include 5 Christmas episodes of Ozzie and Harriet, 4 of the Beverly Hillbillies, also Christmas episodes of Red Skelton, Jack Benny, Dragnet, Burns and Allen, Abbot and Costello, Petticoat Junction. Variety and music shows, such as Liberace and Fred Waring. Drama shows include Four Star Playhouse, Dickens' A Christmas Carol with Vincent Price, even Sherlock Holmes and a Lux Theatre production of Holiday Affair. Many, many more. Other reviewers have included a complete listing here on Amazon. I was astounded to see original commercials included with some of the shows, giving it a real 50's feel! A wonderful step back in time! This is truly marvelous entertainment for the Christmas Season. Sit back with a mug of hot cocoa and some Christmas cookies, with the Christmas tree lights twinkling, curl up with the afghan and enjoy!!",1229040000,197,1600,4.900369003690037

3425024,5,B00198PJNA,"I already owned several DVDs of these Christmas oldies, but it is great to have an entire collection. Some of the shows are a little corny, but it was definitely an era when TV was more innocent and family-friendly. A great way to relax and travel back in time when our own lives can be a bit hectic and stressful.",1476748800,,314,4.25

Like all old tv shows, some of these episodes are dated, some are funnier than others, some more obscure.  But, they're still a fun glimpse of nostalgia, especially for the baby-boomers.",1457222400,,411,4.680555555555555

At least half of the selections hold up very well. Some of the older shows suffer a bit from poorer quality but are still interesting to watch. A few are easy to skip. Even back then, Ozzie and Harriet were tough to take. Over all, this is a solid collection with many hours of fun in store for anyone willing to take the plunge.",1421971200,2,488,4.202127659574468

I'm rating it as okay, because the shows are very enjoyable and I enjoy some of them because they are so rare and almost never shown on TV today. I like that when these shows were released the true meaning of Christmas was not yet lost. They are even allowed to talk about God and Jesus- imagine that?! And the acting is great.

Jed can't shoot the Thanksgiving turkey because it wants to shake his hand.  Meanwhile, over at Racket Squad, they have to arrest Santa. It goes on and on. At less than a dime a show, what do you need to know?

3425072,5,B00198PJNA,"Im so tired of people buying stuff that is clearly public domain material, then bitching about it. Just so you know.... these are not from original studio masters and no millions haven't been dumped into remastering them. So yes some of the episodes are taken from the best available source. Some are better than others. ANother complaint I'm sick of is that the shows are just too old and you shouldnt bother, when the titles are clearly listed on the packaging. Yes clearly they are old shows. To me that is the joy in it. And the simple fact is, if these shows were not put out in this way, they would not be put out at all, and would basically be lost forever. So just because its not ""remastered"" from ""original studio masters"", does not lessen the enjoyment of these shows. If you're old enough to remember how tv used to be and miss it. And you're looking for some good christmas stuff to have on while you're doing holiday stuff around the house. This is a great product. It has a wide variey of programming. And the virtual firelace is very nice.",1385337600,26,1055,4.443298969072165

I have watched the Robin Hood, Racket Squad, Captain Gallant, Sherlock Holmes, Long John Silver, and the Dragnet episodes and have enjoyed them; the three Dragnet episodes being the best of the lot.

3425093,4,B00198PJNA,"My work can be tedious so I like to watch ecclectic videos to break the routine. I bought this for the variety and to get 20+ hours of early TV programming for a low low price. I knew a few of the shows well such as the Beverly Hillbillies and Dragnet. I had heard of Jack Benny and Burns & Allen. I had never heard of Racket Squad or Date with the Angels.

Some of the programming is clearly reminiscent of 1950's white male dominated, anti-communist, post WWII society, so I cannot in good conscience suggest that everyone will find this as entertaining as I did. Most of these shows were live, so there are humorous breaks in the script. Women and African-Americans are often confined to stereotypes, but deliver some fantastic performances. Still, if I wasn't laughing with the shows, I was often laughing at them, and having just as much fun.

This is not going to be everyone's cup of tea, and the quality of the transfer is pretty basic. Still, for the price this is an excellent value.",1357257600,5,993,4.480662983425415

3425098,5,B00198PJNA,"Okay, so a lot of these shows aren't the best quality--a lot of them are 60 years old, for Pete's sake!  And that's what makes this set so charming.  All of these shows seem to be from the early '50s to the early '60s.  The production values of some of them are downright bad.  But you know what?  They're still enjoyable!
And the variety--Christmas episodes of ""Sherlock Holmes""?  ""Robin Hood""?  ""Racket Squad""????  Yes, please!  Lots of comedies, too--Jack Benny, Burns & Allen, even a young Peter Lawford in ""Dear Phoebe.""

3425104,1,B00198PJNA,"Why, you ask, do these episodes look so yucky?

It's because these are supposedly ""public domain"" episodes that were not copyrighted, or copyrights weren't renewed accidentally by the original rights owners.

And so, these aren't made from master film sources, they are generally taken from beat up film or tape copies, many times sent to TV stations when the shows were syndicated around the country.

And that's because the company that put out this mess, has no access to the original master sources.

And anyone can legally copy and sell them, because they are not copyrighted.

The studios that have the original film masters won't let them out, unless they can modify the films in some minor way so they can get a new copyright. And in most cases it's too much work for stuff that's already the flooded the market in PD mode.

If you buy a video set of a show or shows that's owned and put out for sale by one of the major studios like Universal, Paramount or Warner Bros, you'll get the best quality from their original masters.

The comedies were truly funny and not just laughs from embarrashment due to off-color jokes.  Ozzie and Harriet Nelson family would be considered ""square"" now but back then they were the best rounded family you could hope to have.

3425116,5,B00198PJNA,"If you love vintage television, HOLIDAY TV CLASSICS is a major bargain even at full list price and it's usually discounted making it all the more desirable.  This dvd case contains four dvds (uniquely boxed into the case in black (for Christmas dvds??) sleeves rather than the typical dvd gates in such cases), these dvds contain 49 vintage holiday programs, mostly from the 1950's but a few from the early 1960's such as several BEVERLY HILLBILLIES episodes.  This is a nice mix of sitcoms, dramas, and musical programming featuring such Hollywood icons as Jack Benny, Betty White, Red Skelton, Donna Douglas, Buddy Ebsen, Irene Ryan, Max Baer, Maureen O'Sullivan, Ozzie & Harriet & David & Ricky Nelson, George Burns & Gracie Allen, Ray Bolger, Charlie Ruggles, Fred Waring, Peter Lawford, Bob Cummings, Frances Bavier, and scores more, everyone from Ronald Reagan to Liberace.  There's also episodes of long-ago programs featuring such legendary characters as Robin Hood, Annie Oakley, Long John Silver, Sherlock Holmes, and the Scarlet Pimpernel in addition to a 1950's tv adaption of Charles Dicken's A CHRISTMAS CAROL. There's episodes of classic series such as DRAGNET, RACKET SQUAD, and PETTICOAT JUNCTION, hours and hours of vintage programs.  Even if you were born years after most of these shows were made, if you're into tv history and nostalgia you will surely enjoy these episodes.  They are all in black-and-white and some of the print quality is only good, not perfect, so audiences insisting on color and perfect prints won't like it but for the rest of us this is a wonderful bit of true American nostalgia, bringing Christmases of long ago back to life.",1316304000,2,1672,5.065454545454545
3425117,4,B00198PJNA,"I bought this on a whim thinking if it was a dud at least I didn't spend a bundle on it. I am delighted with it. The Christmas episodes from long gone TV shows are incredible. They come from a gentler, less complex time and it's a great trip in the TV Time Machine. I enjoyed all of the ones that I watched and even saw some from shows I don't remember.
I highly recommend this for good clean fun. Also a good study of entertainment in a different era for students of the media
I doubt I would have bought this from looking at the cover as I'm not a Beverly Hillbillies fan but they are a small part of it.
I loved ""Racket Squad"" as a child and even remember meeting Reed Hadley. So I'm glad they included a couple of episodes.
I'm not going to list all of the episodes as others have done that but it is jam packed and definitely worth the money. And if you don't like an episode or so not to worry there are tons more.",1295395200,4,920,4.005434782608695

We had a fun time watching these old shows, and he especially liked seeing the commercials that some of the shows include. (He's old enough to remember most of this stuff!)

A couple of the shows have bad picture resolution (The George and Gracie Show is, sadly, especially bad) and a couple have sound issues. And of course many of the shows and stories are silly and overacted by 21st-century standards. But if you like watching old movies on TCM or if you're a fan of vintage TV, you'll get a kick out of this set.

My favorites were the Ozzie and Harriet episodes, the Ruggles episode, the Jack Benny episodes, and the Date With the Angels episode (featuring a young and lovely Betty White.) and my father-in-law and I got a huge kick out of the old Long John Silver episode with Robert Newton. I would love to see more of these old holiday episodes...surely there are more out there in the public domain!",1290384000,3,1041,4.502645502645502
3425122,4,B00198PJNA,"I picked up this set recently.  Reading the previous reviews I wasn't expecting much in terms of overall picture/sound quality (these are all TV episodes that have fallen into public domain limbo and many are available from multiple cheapo DVD outlets); nevertheless I was quite pleased with the complete package.

Annie Van Auken has already outlined the contents of the set, so there's no need for me to repeat any of that here; but needless to say that if you're a classic TV buff, there's plenty to be enjoyed.  I particularly appreciate the episode from Peter Lawford's short-lived sitcom DEAR PHOEBE (which seemed like it was quite the charmer), and Betty White's one-season wonder A DATE WITH THE ANGELS (Critic's Choice released a DVD with four other episodes from this show a while back, but it's hard to find now).  The Christmas episode of A DATE WITH THE ANGELS (""Santa's Helper"") includes lots of sponsorship material from Plymouth, too!

Aside from a strange ""video calibration"" message flashing up during the final part of the GEORGE BURNS & GRACIE ALLEN SHOW episode, I couldn't find much that's technically wrong with this set.  Regular buyers of public domain TV stuff from Alpha, etc., will be familiar with the standard of picture and sound quality encountered here.
