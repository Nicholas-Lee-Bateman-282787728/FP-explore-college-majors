Though he isn't in it very much, it's great to see everyone's favorate Cobra agent Storm Shadow wiping the floor with US Army soldiers in the Pentagon and then later doing the same to two of Scarletts brothers.  Storm Shadow doesn't have as many major appearances in the tv series as Destro and Cobra Commander but he is one of the more popular ones.  Sort of like BoBa Fett in Star Wars.",1022112000,,423,4.397435897435898
