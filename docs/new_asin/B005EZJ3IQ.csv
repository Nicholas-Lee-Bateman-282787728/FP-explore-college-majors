4670206,5,B005EZJ3IQ,"This is a gem of a performance.  My son loves it and even my husband and I adore it.  We found this streaming one day and enjoyed it enough to buy our own copy, not to mention send it as a birthday gift to several of our friends children.",1387756800,,238,3.836734693877551
4670207,5,B005EZJ3IQ,One of the most intelligent and creative interpretations of The Cat In The Hat available.  The costumes and acting are charming.,1386547200,,128,5.095238095238095
4670208,5,B005EZJ3IQ,"I showed this to my 2nd grade class after reading many dr. Suess books during read across america week. They love it! And so do I! :-)

Last year I showed it to my special needs kindergarten class and it kept their interest the entire time!",1364515200,,240,4.217391304347826
4670209,5,B005EZJ3IQ,"While I think it is great that Hollywood acknowledges the creativity and talents of ""Dr. Seuss""....they use entirely too much ""poetic license"" and manage to mangle and ruin everything they touch of his in their effort to modernize his tales. Dr. Seuss' tales don't need Hollywood's help, they are timeless and entertaining as they are.
The National Theater's production of ""The Cat in the Hat"" proves the point. Not only are they true to the written story...script is verbatim; but they are true to his drawings as well- down to the last squiggle. The show is very cleverly staged and executed...to the obvious delight of the audience. This is a captivating ""live version"" of the book. Worth every penny!",1351728000,6,704,4.92436974789916
4670210,5,B005EZJ3IQ,"I don't know what the other reviewer's problem is.  My kids LOVE this!!!!  We originally found this on Netflix, and I hope to buy a dvd copy because you never know how long something will stay on netflix.

But my children will sit and watch this EVERY time that I put it on.  It easily holds their attention!  I especially love that it is the book, put on as a play.  My kids love the book too so I love that they make the connection.....that it was a book first and then became a theatre production......something I hope to instill in my children as they grow up and hopefully read more.....instead of resorting to tv and movies for their main source of entertainment.  ;)

Is it possible to overanalyze and be critical of every little thing?  sure.  But seriously, what is the point?  It is obviously intended for young children, and it obviously would be much better in person.  But that isn't always possible.  And this is a great, entertaining substitute!!!!

Easily worth the mere $7 that it cost!",1351382400,3,1003,4.5307262569832405
4670211,2,B005EZJ3IQ,"Remember this name: Ross MacGibbon. If you see it attached, as director, to ANYTHING, run.

Why?

Okay, picture this: A brilliantly staged/choreographed acrobatic ballet featuring fantastic dancers and actors.

Now, imagine filming this ballet AND FILMING MOST OF IT IN CLOSE-UPS OF THE PERFORMERS FACES!!!!!!!!!!!

Idiotic, no?

Idiotic, YES!

And the person who performed this Entertainment Lobotomy on the delightful National Theatre's 30 minute (not quite ballet, but near enough) adaptation of the Seuss masterpiece is the afore mentioned Mr. MacGibbon.

It's sad, really. Because, what one CAN see of the production leads one to believe it could have been superb home entertainment.",1326844800,5,688,5.621359223300971
8469364,5,B005EZJ3IQ,My son loved watching this on Netflix many moons back and so glad I was able to find it again! This is a must have!!!!!,1521244800,,119,3.8
8469365,5,B005EZJ3IQ,"Love that I could go to Amazon and easily find this!! My three year old at the time must have asked to watch this at least 30 times on Netflix streaming! Then we forgot about for a short period and when I went to turn it on a year later, it was gone! Yikes, why would they do that? So of course I went to dependable Amazon and there it is! I was just last night able to take my two little girls to the theatre and see the live show on stage. So I ordered two of the dvd's and had them 2 day shipped and they were here in time for me to give them to the girls as souvenirs after the show! They loved it!",1452729600,,602,3.7109375
8469366,5,B005EZJ3IQ,I LOVE this version of The Cat in the Hat. It follows the book almost to a T and my 12 month old has been watching this version for a while now and loves the shenanigans the Cat and Thing 1&2 get into.,1449014400,,201,3.697674418604651
8469367,5,B005EZJ3IQ,This is absolutely fantastic! I love how they did it. I wish I could get the music!,1433203200,,83,3.9411764705882355
8469368,5,B005EZJ3IQ,"My son loves this production of the cat in the hat. The pacing is good, the acting is great and the emotions come across to him better than any cartoon. He sits with his book and goes through the sequence of the play along the pages of his book. Perfect. Now I have to hide it every once in a while so he doesn't watch it over and over and wear it out too fast.",1422316800,,361,3.8266666666666667
8469369,5,B005EZJ3IQ,A great acting company and they helped prepare my granddaughter for her first high school play.,1416873600,,95,5.0
8469370,4,B005EZJ3IQ,Excellent for young children.,1412985600,,29,6.5
8469371,5,B005EZJ3IQ,"Used to a shortened version of this on Netflix incessantly with my two year old grandson and he was so sad when it was no longer available. Ordered the DVD, which includes the full text of the book in subtitles, and it's now I can sit with him and share his fun as we watch ""Cat Hat"". Some of the grownups in the family find it boring but I'm totally engaged by the way they bring the book to life, without any gimmicks. Great staging, costume and terrific set design. Angus Wright is an AMAZING ""Cat""!",1397606400,,502,4.239583333333333
8469372,5,B005EZJ3IQ,"Love this, the kids love this. It was on Netflix for quite awhile but they've recently removed it and the kids weren't happy. Found it here on Amazon cheap enough that I bought 2 copies so far.",1395532800,,193,4.243243243243243
8469373,5,B005EZJ3IQ,Brilliant and captivating! My children watch it everyday! Introduces them to a play setting and poetry.  The acting is great!,1392940800,,125,5.25
