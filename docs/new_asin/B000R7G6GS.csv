2859154,5,B000R7G6GS,My seven-year-old loves all the All About Videos.  I recommend them all.  He prefers to watch these over cartoons and other videos.  I prefer them also. My son often reflects upon them when we are out in the world and he sees something that he has just learned about in his All About Video.  The videos have been a great source of information and fun.,1261008000,,351,4.3538461538461535
2859155,2,B000R7G6GS,"This move is just ok.

My husband is a Police Officer so I was hoping to find a dvd with lots of police cars for my 2 year old.  This movie is definitely informative, but it is SO outdated neither my husband nor I could stand to watch it!

I'm sure it would be great for older kids, but still I can't get past how outdated it is.

I have bought other ""All About"" DVDs (trains, airplanes, trucks.) I was looking for a section of each dvd with non-stop police cars/trains/trucks/airplanes moving around as a constant stimulus for my toddler.  These dvds have a lot of talking--not nearly enough action to keep my toddler or me watching.",1260835200,3,634,4.384615384615385
2859156,5,B000R7G6GS,"My little boy loves Police, Firetrucks...any kind of truck period! He loves these video's.  To be honest my older kids 5- 10 years old love them also.
I also like the fact that most of the video's come with 2 shows in one...so less dvd's in the house and more $$$$ in my pocket.",1247011200,,278,4.148148148148148
2859157,4,B000R7G6GS,"My son just turned four and he loves this DVD. It has two parts, one covering the police and the other feature on  search and rescue. While the search and rescue portion is informative and educational, I don't care for the police portion. I had to stop and think of a good response when my son asked me ""what does narcotic mean?""",1218412800,3,329,4.306451612903226

8198999,5,B000R7G6GS,My autistic son loved this. He watches it on a continuous loop for a good week before switching to another DVD. I know more about law enforcement now than I ever cared to know. It's amazing what you can pick up just from background noise.,1439078400,,238,4.311111111111111

8199002,4,B000R7G6GS,"It is a good video, very educational and fun to watch. My six year old liked it very much. However, it looked like it was made in the late 80s or early 90s. Time for an update! P.S.  My son said it should have included a police van.",1389484800,,232,3.8333333333333335

8199004,5,B000R7G6GS,"My 3-4 year old just loves these series and will sit for hours if we let him as he watches them.  I have to say that he does learn things on them all.  It does give a good overview of things he sees like trucks, ships, etc.  This one does the same for him.  Just be prepared to hear it over and over!",1296345600,,300,3.7142857142857144
8199005,1,B000R7G6GS,"It's....ok.

The police portion is woefully outdated and the video quality is poor.  I like some of the All About Series for the kids but pass on the police one.",1268611200,,161,4.333333333333333
