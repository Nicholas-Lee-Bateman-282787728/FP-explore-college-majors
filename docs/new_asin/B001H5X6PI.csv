3623375,1,B001H5X6PI,"The reason I buy Dragon Dynasty movies is because it always includes the original audio and soundtrack of the movies.  I feel the same way as all the other 1 star ratings posted so far.

Dragon Dynasty, you should re-release this movie giving it the proper treatment!",1235520000,6,267,4.659574468085107
3623376,1,B001H5X6PI,"Unfortunately, I must agree with the negative reviews above. I own every single title released by Dragon Dynasty and have always been very pleased, not as much with the selection of titles (some are just ok, nothing great), but mostly with the quality of their transfers both in terms of sound and picture quality. And the extras are good as well. However, here comes The Enforcer, the latest Dragon Dynasty offering, a Jet Li vehicle that is far away from his best efforts. The movie itself is watchable, fairly entertaining, overacted but nicely choreographed. The extras, though scarce, are fine as well. But the transfer is plain bad. The image is not as clean as any other DD title (even the oldest ones); it is easy to tell it has not been remastered. However, the main problem here is with the audio track: there is only one offering, a dubbed English track. And it is dreadful, and it makes this film a heck of a nightmare to watch. For as far as I am concern, this shows a lack of respect for us, the consumers, on the part of DD and its parents and/or affiliates and I would like to strongly urge you to not buy this movie and, if you have already bought it, to return it and wait for a proper release of this film.",1234742400,10,1225,4.400881057268722
3623377,4,B001H5X6PI,"I had never seen this movie before, but some people seem to be unsatisfied with this DVD release. I have bought all the Dragon Dynasty movies and this is the first one I noticed that doesnt have the original language and music. I would have preferred that and it is probably what keeps me from giving the DVD release 5 stars. The movie is a pretty good Jet Li flick. Not better then Fist of Legend but better then most of his newer stuff. I found it suprising that I enjoyed the Tse Miu scenes more then the Jet Li ones.

3623378,1,B001H5X6PI,"Read this carefully. This movie is fun and exciting. It's a well done Jet Li film. I like the chemistry between Jet Li and his son. But this release by Dragon Dynasty is horrible. They did not release the film in it's original language nor with its original soundtrack.

If you are a purist then avoid this release and find a Hong Kong import that does the film the just that it deserves.",1234224000,10,388,4.315068493150685
3623379,1,B001H5X6PI,"Dragon Dynasty finally went and did what the whining, cynical fanboys said they would.  They simply repackaged the same disrespectful dubbed, edited version of a film they crapped out in the early days.  This film features ONLY dubbed English audio, and is not the full uncut version of the film.  How sad.",1233792000,7,306,4.846153846153846
3623390,5,B001H5X6PI,I'm a big Jet Li fan. This movie is really good & I can't stop watching them. I can't get enough of these movies. Dragon dynasty has some pretty good movies.,1374364800,,157,4.096774193548387

3623392,5,B001H5X6PI,It has alot of action shows about a person struggles and the survial of one that had lost everything love friendships and how to stand up to your enemies this is really a great  movie thank you,1359504000,,193,4.216216216216216
3623393,1,B001H5X6PI,I love the movie but was very dissapointed with this purchuse because the dvd was all scratched and unplayable and i could not return it for i had to open it up to find out the condition and the policy was that cant return open items. well that is very messed up and it makes me wonder about the films that i buy in the future.,1357948800,,327,3.9696969696969697
3623394,5,B001H5X6PI,"This is one my favorite Hong Kong films. Especially because it's got awesome action/fight scenes AND a fluid story.  The plot is mediocre, but how the story progresses makes sense.  Jet Li is of course always amazing, but what makes this film so great is his son in the film played by Xie Mao who does his own action scenes and stunts.  Anita Mui is brilliant as always & definitely has her own shares of amazing fight scenes.  This is definitely a more serious, action film but it's not dark or depressing.  It's got it's own little quirks and little jokes throughout the film & I've watched this many times. I definitely recommend for people to own it.",1327190400,,654,4.508474576271187
3623395,3,B001H5X6PI,"I was a little disappointed in this movie.  From seeing the preview I thought this would have been a really great movie especially with all the people that were in it, but the title is far from being accurate.  The movie is ok, but Li's character is a little flaky.  He is an undercover police man who has a very ill wife and a small son.  His boss doesn't care about that and sends him out on assignments.  Li doesn't ask them to check on his wife and son at all.  It takes another police officer from another province to see to them and ends up taking the son with her when his mother dies.  The real highlight of this movie is the actor that plays his son, Tse Mui.  He is really great for a child his age.  Look forward to seeing more of him.",1317600000,,746,4.054794520547945
3623396,2,B001H5X6PI,"Shame on Dragon Dynasty for abusing its reputation.
Why re-release the same old lousy version of a movie
that Jet Li fans already have access to.
What I loved about Dragon Dynasty
is that they did not do that. I guess they do now.
I will wait for a re-release of ""My Father Is A Hero""
with the original language and music and without
whatever other changes were made
or will seek one elsewhere.
I suggest fans of Jet Li, martial arts and police dramas
do the same.",1301443200,,464,4.284090909090909
3623397,4,B001H5X6PI,"The Enforcer is a good movie from my perspective. The movie's story is about a man who works undercover while his wife is sick, and his job gets in the way of being with his family. Before buying this movie I thought that there was going to be the chinese language audio, but sadly to my disappointment,  the movie only has the english audio. I am not sure if America cut out some parts, but if only the movie had the original audio with subtitles, the dvd would have been much better.",1269388800,2,485,4.271739130434782
3623398,5,B001H5X6PI,"The Enforcer is a cute film.  There is action in this movie, that is what makes ir so great.  It is different then any other fim I have seen him in.  Just to see a cute film, this is it, but there is still action in it.  I have this DVD.",1266969600,,237,3.588235294117647
3623399,1,B001H5X6PI,"That's what it seems like when I buy a Jet Li title. Especially ones I don't hear about or check into until later. Sometimes I just have to grab a kung fu flick and face the music later. I buy most of my kung fu flicks from Amazon as I can find anything here. The only catch is when I'm in the mood to get a new flick right then and there, I have to take chances on movies like these.

This is about the 3rd or 4th sorry Jet Li movie I got on the fly. Pretty bad movie. I know its no more than a 2, but I'm still undecided rather to give it a 1. Therefore I'll give it a 1.5. It sucked pretty bad, the english dubs we're sucky, the storyline was sucky, and whenever Jet Li plays with a son, the son is always weird as hell.

If you want to waste your money then feel free to buy. I said this before, but great actors have to play in sucky movies too. To tell you the truth, Donnie Yen has made more consistent movies. I still haven't seen IP man, but from what I hear it's his best. I'll have to see if it's as good as Fearless. If it is then I'd have to say Donnie Yen is a more consistent buy. Because if you don't know about a Jet Li movie before you buy, you usually end up getting screwed over.

As opposed to if you buy a Donnie Yen flick off the fly, you may get screwed over. But most times it's pretty entertaining, or mediocre at best. But I haven't got many movies with Donnie Yen in it that we're just horrible and unbearable.",1251590400,,1438,3.8843537414965987
