It was rated only about 3 stars, but it had some decent acting and a little 'twist' to keep it interesting. Somewhere in the intro there was a note that it was based on a true story.. not sure if that's true, but it was a good watch, nonetheless.",1360195200,,341,4.246153846153846
8010949,5,B0001DCYG4,"I hadnt seen any trailers on this one or heard anything about it but picked it up while browsing and I am very glad I did.  In my opinion, it is a great independent film and after seeing it, I opted to buy it.  It isn't flashy or big budget but really is very entertaining.  I was pulling for the characters to see their way clear to a relationship and I really enjoyed the twist at the end.  The relationship of Sam and his student was great and so normal because teenagers are just that way.  The actors played people in the film who had character, values and integrity. Sam's student, as a teenager didn't just let the boys jump her bones, Janet didn't just jump into bed with Sam on the first date and Sam respected her feelings by not pushing the point.  When Janet made a major mistake that hurt Sam, she apologized without turning it around and trying to put the blame on Sam.  That is why I think this is a really good relationship movie because this kind of stuff really happens.",1094428800,,988,4.279569892473118
