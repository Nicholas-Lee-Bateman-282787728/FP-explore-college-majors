8173218,3,B000B5KFIG,"I was so thrilled to get this set today as I have a real interest in royalty, especially Queen Elizabeth.  However, even though it says VHS on the back of the pretty tape holder, it is in PAL format and won't play on American VCRs.  (I tried)-  Very disappointing.  It looks like a wonderful series and I would still like to see it.  You shoulw love it, if you have the capability of playing this BBC tape set from the U.K.  Good luck to you!",1245456000,,442,4.141176470588236
