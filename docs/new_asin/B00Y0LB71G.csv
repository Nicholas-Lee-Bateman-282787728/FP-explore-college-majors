8717296,5,B00Y0LB71G,"We are big fans of The Killers!  We not only love their music but admire them as band members and enjoy getting to know them from interviews and documentaries like this.  We very much enjoyed hearing about them from friends, from them in interviews and seeing pictures and videos of them in this DVD set.",1462406400,,304,4.509090909090909
8717297,5,B00Y0LB71G,"This is a good DVD boxed set, it includes two DVDs one of which is a documentary film, the other, my preferred film of the two,is a collection of excellent interviews with Brandon and the other guys and is worth getting if you're fan of this very accomplished group.
Brandon's views I always find interesting and one of my favorite interviews on here is one where he puts that awful man , Richard Dawkins, in his place in a humble and respectful way. Dawkins is such a know all and respects no one or their faith - which he refuses to acknowledge is a personal matter for the individual. Brandon is a Mormon which is something he believes in, and Dawkins attempts to convert him to Atheism, not understanding that faith is not a scientific principle but a matter of personal belief which defies logic.
Dawkins and his Ilk refuse to believe anything they cant see with the naked eye - idiots...",1454112000,,893,4.518518518518518
8717298,5,B00Y0LB71G,Ok I'm Here to explain what this actually is. It's 2 DVDs for a reason this is a sort of Bootleg thing nothing Is authorized By the band members at all. The first dvd is something that you could buy it by itself its the killers leaving Las Vegas DVD from 2007 where they interview some people who knew the band when they were first starting out to get a inside story on how they came to be. The 2nd DVD is the best one of all and you can't buy this separate. The 2nd DVD is from 2015 and it's called Secrets & Whispers. This is a compilation. Of interviews with the band and nothing else and it's very good. So that's what this is i bought this not knowing what was on the DVDs. I'm happy i got this.,1449878400,8,700,3.971631205673759
