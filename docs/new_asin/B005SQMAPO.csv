4885908,4,B005SQMAPO,"This is a bundle of three blu-ray sets, which contains every ""Planet of the Apes"" movie ever released:

1. Planet of the Apes - 5-Film Collection  (includes Planet of the Apes; Beneath the Planet of the Apes; Escape from the Planet of the Apes; Conquest of the Planet of the Apes; Battle for the Planet of the Apes)
2. Planet of the Apes - 2001 Tim Burton remake starring Mark Wahlberg
3. Rise of the Planet of the Apes

Each of these movies come with a wide variety of special features and supplements.  One of the most notable extras for ""Planet of the Apes"" are the audio commentaries with the actors, makeup artist John Chambers, and composer Jerry Goldsmith.  For those who love the music, included on some of the discs are isolated score tracks (in DTS-HD 5.1).  One of the great things about the blu-rays is that you can go behind-the-scenes of the making of the movies.  In particular, it's a treat to see the complex makeup work that was used to achieve the look of the apes in the early films (and the visual effects work on ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is also extremely interesting).

*At this time of this review, this bundle is the Gold Box Deal for $27.49.  Amazon's prices change frequently, and in some cases it may be cheaper to buy the movies individually.",1380844800,12,1279,4.478448275862069

Planet of the Apes (1968) / Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) / Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) / Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) / Battle of the Planet of the Apes (1973) / Planet of the Apes (2001) / Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)",1380844800,160,420,4.25

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is set for a 2014 release (not included). There are some extras included on each disc. The Evolution Collection is a great set for POTA fans who want all the films in one collection. My personal favorite is Beneath the Planet of the Apes. Charlton Heston was wonderful in the first two films, Roddy McDowall is excellent and some other cast members show up in more than one film.

This collection includes all the original movies, which are all fun as hell, plus the really cringey Marky Mark remake, AND the new reboot, which was, well, just awesome. All transfers are spectacular, and watching the original movies in 1080p is worth the price of admission alone.  There may be other packs that include just the originals, but bite the bullet and get this one because its' probably going to be cheaper.  Unlike some other boxes, this is full of slim cases, not full blu-ray cases, so it will fit better on your shelf and bend like a Jamaican limbo dancer. You will want to watch the Wahlberg remake just to remind you of how bad things got for a little while before you watch Gollum play the progenitor of the Planet of the Apes.

4885959,1,B005SQMAPO,"This review if for the package, Planet of the Apes: Evolution Collection.

Three of the seven discs are defective; will not play at all on a US Blu-ray player.  (I don't know if they'll play on a European player, but for me, they're worse than worthless.)  The four movies that will play show the movie but none of the other features normally available with Power DVD16 (disc menu, extra features, menus, remembering where it was in playing an interrupted movie) are available.

Nifty packaging, though:  Seven individual plastic jewel boxes for the seven movies.

There is the compound annoyance that I cannot print a return label, so I requested that a label be mailed to me and after a week, no label has arrived in the mail; nor is there any way to on the Amazon web site to check on the request for a printed label.

In the future, I will avoid all Blu-ray items that display European region codes, no matter what their claims about region-free compatibility.",1464912000,5,964,4.668639053254438

But, and I don't understand this at all, every time you pause it long enough for the Blu-Ray player to shut down, or just turn it off, you can't start the movies at the point that you shut down. You have to endure all the lead-in garbage, then search for the scene you were on. The person at the store where I purchased the player said that some Blu-Rays do not have the info on them to restart at the point of stopping, so apparently they left that little bit of info off these.",1385164800,,540,4.201923076923077
4886001,5,B005SQMAPO,"Aside from the Marky Mark/Tim Burton film, this is a terrific collection.

The original 1969 Planet of the Apes still has one of the greatest endings in cinema history. The 4 sequels that followed were all a lot of fun, and the 2011 prequel (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) was a smart franchise reinvention and a successful un-boot that un-boots Tim Burton's reboot and restores the ORIGINAL continuity!",1385078400,,404,4.771428571428571
4886002,3,B005SQMAPO,"The original movies, while nostalgic in the case of my wife and I, seem much more amateurish, now, than they did at their initial release.  The Mark Wahlberg remake, while only mediocre in overall quality, is at least a notch up from those.  The recent film (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) is clearly head-and-shoulders above the other films, not just in writing and acting quality, but also in emotional content.  Hopefully the sequel to it will be of the same quality.",1384732800,,471,4.650602409638554

4886006,5,B005SQMAPO,"A wonderful price for the complete collection in brilliant Blu-ray!  To me the classic ""Planet of the Apes"" first movie is the best (just the spaceship crash landing of the Icarus in Lake Powell is the best introduction visual/storyline of astronauts coming to a new planet ever made!!!  The newest ""Apes Rising"" movie continues the excellence of the Apes story-telling in an up to date, thoroughly enjoyable setting, leaving us to wonder how they will improve upon the shaky timeline of the original five!  If you grew up in the 60's or 70's, this collection is a great way to enjoy all and set the stage for what's hopefully ahead!!!  Well worth the investment!",1383609600,,663,4.7894736842105265

4886017,4,B005SQMAPO,"I wrote this review during a special Amazon had selling this set for under $30. At that time it was a really smoking hot deal. Now? Not so much. I'll get to the point. You're better off getting the separate disks or collections as this current price is like buying the separate disks and getting Tim Burton's Apes for free. The five disk classic Apes collection is a worthwhile buy because not only do you get the remastered, high definition versions of these movies you also get the documentary from each film that was made at that time. This includes the fantastic ""Behind the Planet of the Apes"" full length documentary of all five films. Time Burton's remake is included in this particular collection, but it is the same visually lackluster Blu-Ray was released a while back with only a director commentary as it's only added bonus (as well as new packaging capitalizing on Mark Wahlberg's current star status). Rise of the Planet of the Apes tops off the collection with all the same special features that came from the previous Blu-Ray release (not a bad overall effort). Here's a rundown on the movies themselves:

The Planet of the Apes (1968)

This is the grand of them all. The movie that still rises above and beyond all the incarnations following it. The idea may now look novel, but that's only because back in 1968 this movie thrilled the world. The innovations in make up still stand up to this day. The story (written by Rod Serling) is also filled with speculation, philosophical observation, and a challenge to 60's sensibilities. Add a tiny bit of tongue-in-cheek wit along with stellar performances by most the cast and you have yourself a classic.

Beneath the Planet of the Apes

With the huge success of the first movie a sequel had to be made. This time star Charlton Heston wanted to be written out so Taylor clone James Franciscus is added. The movie is a bit slanted with some heavy handed anti-war movement influences that felt forced in an otherwise solid story that moves beyond the whole ""planet is filled with talking apes"" concept and reveals an even more sinister opponent. This movie was supposed to to end the series...but that didn't happen apparently.

Escape from the Planet of the Apes

So all that stuff that happened that was supposed to end the series? Well... writers have a way of creating all sorts of angles to keep this movie going. Our favorite chimpanzee protagonists find a way to get back to modern day Earth. It's a sure stretch of the imagination, and it also flies in the face of established ""Apes"" continuity. However you cannot deny this film endeavors to give you the same deep thinking that the first movie presented. The solid story and balance between comedy, melodrama, and rather serious overtones goes a long way in helping you forget the retconning.

Conquest of the Planet of the Apes

This is a very different story than all the others. We are down to one talking ape and the world is starting to become a dystopian society in his eyes. All the 60's protest and anti-establishment sentiment from Beneath the Planet of the Apes starts come out in a more appropriate setting about starting a revolution. Again, the continuity of the franchise is tampered with even more with timelines sped up to an unbelievable pace if you think about it. And much like the previous movie it's hard to be bitter about such things because the writing is so good. This is Roddy McDowell's time to shine as the titular talking ape Caesar. Previous performances put him in either supporting or co-starring roles. Here you get a serious performance even through the makeup.

Battle for the Planet of the Apes

Now we come full circle. Apes control the planet in a post apocalyptic setting devoid of high technology. Each of the subsequent movies since the first Planet of the Apes films had smaller and smaller budgets, and Battle ended up with a miniscule one. While it's not a bad movie when you compare it to the others it is a pale comparison. Seems to try to take elements from the previous films in a means to connect to them and wrap up the series. Still it's satisfying enough; even if this film is but a shadow of its pedigree.

Planet of the Apes (2001)

Tim Burton's remake of the classic film really misses the mark. I have noticed that Burton can be hit and miss with some franchises, and this was one of his misses. The movie is filled with odd cliches, inconsistent plot structure, uninspiring story, a disturbing ape/man love interest angle, and is peppered with painfully obvious pop culture references that go nowhere near the wit of the original. The makeup effects may be considered an improvement in some aspects, but there are times when watching this film I yearn for the original ape masks. As an action spectacle it is serviceable, but not much else. Burton's Apes is only worth getting on a collection if it's cheap as free (in both story and disc quality), or better.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes

This is a remake of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. It does away with any pretense that there is any previous ape history and starts the franchise off fresh. This is the first film of the new story line. It's surprisingly good and balances out the suspense and thrills with some pretty intelligent story and character development. As a fan of the previous successful franchise who doesn't shy away from its faults I am looking forward to seeing this one develop.

I would only recommend this collection ONLY if you love all the Apes movies, AND it's cheaper to get them in this collection than to buy separately.",1380844800,37,5588,4.6703967446592065

8485271,1,B005SQMAPO,"I just recently purchases this set, expecting it to be blu-ray, region free, and have bonus features. Instead I got a lousy DVD set with it being exclusive to region 2, not having any special features, and the set itself being damaged. I clearly spent $50 to get the nice blu-ray set (since it says it's blu ray). Whatever I'm about to call Amazon up, and if they don't give me the blu ray set (like I paid for) there will be a problem. One star until my issue is fixed.",1498780800,3,470,4.175824175824176
