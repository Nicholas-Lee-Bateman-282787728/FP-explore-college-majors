7836065,4,6303048064,"I love this movie about the business man who goes completely ""natural""...who then joins up with Ann-M who wears nothing but sweaters with no pants while riding ""hogs"" for the whole movie--but there is a party scence at a mansion near the end--where you see Ann M dropping her clothes to join the prophet in the bath..and then a Cardinal playing cards gets up to go to the bathroom ---and the payoff must be when the cardinal walks in on AnnM and the Prophet in the bath....but on this VHS...it's just -blip- the next day....I know they cut the juiciest AnnM moment---  how sad.  I know the bathtub scene from memory because they once played this movie everyday for a week on an obscure UHF station.  P",1210982400,3,701,4.503937007874016
7836066,3,6303048064,"Having no other choice but to leave Hollywood for Italy(where the only movie offers were), Ann-Margret got a big surprise in 1968 when her ""Tiger and the Pussycat"" with Vittorio Gassman managed to turn a small profit; this one is the follow-up, not made in '76 but also in 1968, wherein Gassman plays a hermit lured out of seclusion and proclaimed a profit, and Ann-Margret co-stars as a sexy local girl in on the action. It's threadbare moviemaking, but not without inspiration. A-M, a bit blowsier than before and unencumbered with character details, plows through at full speed, relying on her smoky quality. As a film it ain't much, but strictly as a star-vehicle it has some appeal.",1111104000,2,687,4.830508474576271
