8463257,4,B005AA0C4Y,"Love the movie, it's a classic Disney Princess without the downs. Buts it's not an actual Disney movie.
I can't say much about the movie without spoiling it. There are two prince brothers and the eldest is about to be crowned king, which is in beginning of movie. You find out the eldest is a spoiled jerk who guess what? Is the bad guy. In the first 10 mins of the movie the younger brother is crowned king and both brothers have a baby girl. Sadly the good brother wife dies during birth and the bad guy comes up with a plan to switch the babies so his daughter becomes princess.
It's an amazing twist on a classic that puts so much out on the table and you can't help but to dog in.
I love this movie and I'm in high school,  my little cousins enjoy it as well. Awesome movie definitely recommended.",1432598400,,802,4.207792207792208

8463260,5,B005AA0C4Y,"This film should be more well known. I loved the soundtrack, and the story went a bit different from the tale we are very familiar with. Instead of just showing up at the castle, its about a Princess switch (think prince and the papuper) but one done from birth by the unsuspected evil family seeking revenge. It's worth the time to sit down and watch this fun film. I especially loved the song ""IN my kingdom of the Heart Reprise"" The vocal duet is chilliing and amazing, more emotion than any of the new disney songs.",1410480000,2,519,4.416666666666667
8463261,5,B005AA0C4Y,"This is a wonderful family friendly movie that, to me, is reminiscent of the early Disney movies. It's a beautiful classic tale that is packed with good values and a perfect addition to any family's movie collection.",1376697600,,216,4.864864864864865
8463262,5,B005AA0C4Y,"I admitt I'm an adult and I love animated movies! Uh-huh, I got this movie because I've seen it on Youtube. Then my sister suggested looking on Amazon and I found it!! The music is great and the story is complex and intriguing. It may be a little confussing to kids but its a great family movie.",1365120000,2,295,4.192982456140351
8463263,5,B005AA0C4Y,"Really cute movies and one of my favorites as a kid.
I got this for my stepdaughter and she just loves all the singing and animals.
Now this movie is not like the original story of the princess and the pea but still yes there is a princess and pea it's just that the princess is switched with her cousin after being born and the princesses mother dieing.
The evil uncle of the princess asks if his wife can take care of the princess sense he and his wife lost there own baby girl and so the king says yes the kings brother the evil uncle switches the baby's and gives the princess to some pig farmers but a few years later the girls r all grown up the evil brother of the kings daughter the fake princess is a nasty brat and the real princess is a sweet and loving girl looking for her prince.
So she meets the prince they fall in love but he can't merry her b/c she is not a princess and so on.
So he goes looking for the right princess does not find her evil fake princess wont's the prince but he does not want her long story short there is some fighting and the real princess and prince live happily ever after the end yay!
I know this is the worst review ever but the movie is really good so please don't let my poorly written review make u think about getting this movie just give it a try please. ^_^",1354406400,2,1307,4.05019305019305
8463264,5,B005AA0C4Y,An excellent revision of the story with good music and storyline. I personally prefer this to the book. It's set sometime after the original princess slept on a pea in a time where the reign of the 18th king may fall.,1352505600,,217,4.317073170731708
8463265,4,B005AA0C4Y,I love this movie. I used to watch it all the time and when it came in the mail it looked the way it did in the picture so the product was great. There was also no scratching in the dvd which I also liked but.,1345420800,2,209,3.5652173913043477
