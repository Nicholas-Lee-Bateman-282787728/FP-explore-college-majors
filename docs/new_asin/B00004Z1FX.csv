1379582,4,B00004Z1FX,"This film proves that returning back to the basics every few years can be very refreshing and profitable. Samuel L Jackson plays John Shaft very differently, but he makes the role his own. He has Great support from two brilliant actors in the two main bad guy roles. Christian Bale expands on his ""American Psycho"" role, making him a rich, spoiled, daddys boy psycho instead of a rich spoiled psycho. He is also very underused in the second half of the film. The second half belongs to Jeffrey Wright as Peoples , another psycho who threatens to kill Shaft and threatens to steal the film. He really is great. The Ending is slightly Anti- Climatic (which seems to be a problem with a few of Samuels Movies. ""Rules of Engagement"" and ""The Negotiator"" to name two"") but, all-around, its a great way to kill 90 minutes.",974678400,,816,4.595890410958904

1379585,5,B00004Z1FX,"When I first went to see Shaft I thought it was going to be a nice time for a nap, but I was wrong.  Shaft had a good plot with great acting. Well, let's get down to business, the story goes as this, When Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson) gets called to a murder scene, he meets a young man who will rattle his nerves for years (Christian Bale).  I don't want to ruin the movie for you one bit so I'll close with this, Shaft's still a bad mutha - you get the rest.  Michael Stanton",970012800,,473,3.90625
1379586,5,B00004Z1FX,"What can I say, Shaft is still a bad *******!  John Singleton brings us Shaft, in an updated action movie with political overtones.  What can I say, not only does Singleton show us what a brother can do in the new century, but he also kicks some serious tail!  Yes, Shaft doesn't ""score"" to much with the ladies, but he doesn't need to.  He's to busy kicking but.",970012800,,363,4.294117647058823
1379587,5,B00004Z1FX,"The casting couldn't have been better, Samuel L. Jackson as John Shaft.  I had heard they were thinking of Don Cheadle playing the super cool private dick that;s a sex machine to all the chicks.  Don's a teriffic actor, but the role of John Shaft could not have been played better.  John is the nephew of the original John Shaft, played by Richard Roundtree, who has a cameo in the film, reprising his original role.  Shaft comes across a young racist punk, named Walter Wade, Jr., played well by Christian Bale.  Walter has killed a black man outside of a club with a pipe to the head.  wade, thaks to his wealthy real estate mogul father, escapes justice, and seeks the help of a street gang leader, named Peoples Hernandez, played excellently by Jeffery Wright.  He hires Peoples to locate a waitress, a witness to Wade's brutal crime.  shaft quits the police force after bringing in Wade twice, and both times, having him slip through his fingers, due to legal loopholes.  He finds the waitress, and protects her from Peoples's gang, two crooked cops, and from Wade, with the help of police officer Vanessa Williams.  With great direction by John Singleton, this is an excellent breath of air into the character of Shaft, and the studio's hopes of a possible franchise.  Also, look for a cameo by Lawrence Taylor.",969753600,,1317,4.707423580786026

1379593,5,B00004Z1FX,"Really great job by John Singleton as writer & director of the updated version of ""Shaft"" and what a great cast!! As always, brilliant acting by Samuel Jackson who looked really handsome with that bald head & stylish goatee. Also brilliant acting by the original ""Shaft"" Richard Roundtree, he was a great inclusion to the movie! Also brilliant acting by Jeffrey Wright as the Dominican gangster, Peoples Hernandez. Jeffrey was awesome in that role and mesmerizing to watch on screen, he really pulled off that Dominican look & accent as genuine. Christian Bale was awesome in his role as the white, rich, arrogant, racist who assaulted great actor, Mekhi Phifer who was awesome in his role as the assault victim. Toni Collette was great as the frazzled, scared waitress who witnessed the assault and was threatened by Christian Bale if she told what she saw. Vanessa Williams did a great job as a cop, rapper Busta Rhymes did a great job as Shaft's sidekick & even though his role was small, Lawrence Taylor the football player known as L.T., did a great job in his role as a friend of Shaft. In closing, everyone in the movie did a great job, some brilliant & some awesome and the result was a great, brilliant & awesome movie.",1482883200,,1228,4.689814814814815

1379601,4,B00004Z1FX,"This movie far exceeded my expectations.  I expected a campy romp revolving around the original film from yesteryear.  What I got instead was a high powered cop flick with a lot of great acting.  Director John Singleton (4 Brothers, Boyz N the Hood) put together a truly stellar cast.  But he is responsible for the fast pace, tension and the often very clever plot twists.  Just on its own merits in film craftsmanship this might well be his master work.  Singleton has two Oscar nominations to his credit.
  The hard working Samuel L. Jackson, also an Oscar nominee, disappears into his role.  Too often Jackson simple walks through his roles but not this time.  He becomes Shaft, not the flamboyant Shaft of the earlier film but the new, modern Shaft.  Good for him.  And what a great cast he has to back him up.  Shaft the former, the uncle of Shaft the latest, has original star Richard Roundtree in his familiar role.  The bad guy role has Oscar winner Christian Bale filling it with cultured, occasionally violent malignancy.  Watch for Jeffrey Wright who seems to be able to give vibrant life to the characters he plays.  Venessa Williams can still stop a strong man's heart with a look.  She plays a narco squad police woman.  Dan Hedya has a small but important role.  Rapper Busta Rhymes has a supporting role as a Rastfarian friend and helper of Shaft's and does quite well with what he is given to do.  Great character actor Andre Royo (The Wire) also has a small role.  Even Elizabeth Banks (Hunger Games) has an appearance.  Why list all this great if not famous actors?  I want to show that the director took the trouble to cast really good actors all the way down the line and to show that he demanded from each of them their best work.  And even in the smallest role, he got it.  This might not be one of the great movies of all time but it is certainly great movie making.
  Even Isaac Hayes, the composer of the famous, now iconic Shaft theme, has a cameo appearance, but look fast.",1470960000,,2002,4.504178272980502

Such a tough guy with heart, Shaft personifies what you expect a cop to be.  Vanessa Williams is a great actress -- one of her best movie roles in my opinion.  This role was one where she portrayed a plain working woman instead of a pretty role and she carried it brilliantly.  Jeffrey Wright deserves loads of compliments for his role and it was a winning role -- he did such a great job as an Hispanic bad guy.  Also Christian Bale was brilliant in his acting as the ultimate evil guy.  The two bad cops were so good too.  Oh yeah -- there were good guys portrayed by Richard Roundtree and Gordon Parks -- so glad to see them return from the first Shaft movie, great actor and director.  And great acting by Busta Rhymes too.  I just can't stop complimenting but got to before I tell the end of the movie.",1436572800,3,984,4.126315789473685

Giving a cameo to Richard Roundtree didn't help the story in this case. It made the audience crave to see the original Shaft. He still looked the same and looked like their was nothing wrong with him returning as Shaft. If they only had the heart and nerve to let the character grow.

1379737,4,B00004Z1FX,"Shaft (John Singleton, 2000)
[originally posted 19Jun2000]

In this movie, the fifty-two-year-old Samuel L. Jackson takes on his hardest role yet: playing the nephew of a man who was supposedly born only seven years before he was. Still, the versatile Jackson manages to handle the job pretty well, I'd say.

That aside, this is about as much a kick back and enjoy the ride film as you're likely to see this year, and rightfully earns a notch- no matter what happens in the latter half of the year, on the ten-best list.
Singleton decided not to remake the original Tidyman novel/screenplay, but instead drafted him to create a whole new plot, and a whole new Shaft, the nephew of the original played by Richard Roundtree (who, it should also be noted, was born in 1942, so he really WAS twenty-nine in 1971; and having seen the original movie as many times I have, I still can't believe he was that young). This Shaft is a homicide detective who lands a case that looks suspiciously like a race-related killing. We're handed the victim, the killer, and the witness within the first ten minutes; then the victim dies, the killer is granted bail (and skips to Europe), and the witness disappears. And we got us an action film.

Jackson, his trusty sidekick Rasaan (Busta Rhymes), and a nasty organized-crime type named Peoples Hernandez (a fantastic portrayal by veteran character actor Jeffrey Wright) one-liner their way through this script beautifully. Bullets fly, people get smacked, everyone wants a piece of the killer (slimily done by Christian Bale) for their own reasons, and the audience never once gets a chance to catch its breath. Which is just as it should be.

Many of the things about the new Shaft, as compared to the old, are things that the critics are knocking Singleton for, and there may be some credence to what they say, but I'm taking a different interpretation. The original Shaft was a highly-sexualized being who seemed to want to solve cases as something to do in between trips to the sack with every woman he met; Jackson's character has one seemingly out-of-place sexual encounter, and then the sexual aspect of his character is shelved. Where Roundtree's character, upon meeting an out-and-out racist, rose to the bait and came back with double, Jackson only has time for one racist, and then only after the guy does him a favor (and the mutual respect between the two, by the end of that scene, is obvious). There are other little niggling things, but those are the two main ones. And most critics see this as a betrayal of the original character; I see it as the ways in which Tidyman and Singleton wanted to show that these are two different characters with two different agendas that are reactions to the societies around them. And, ultimately, that's what both the 1971 and 2000 models of Shaft are all about; holding a man up to a society and allowing him to reflect it back upon itself.

But who cares about the philosophy? It's time to let the bullets fly. And no one does that better than John Shafteither John Shaft. ****",1384646400,,3063,4.728464419475656

1379780,4,B00004Z1FX,"I grew up in the East Bay in the 70s, oftentimes hanging in neighborhoods where I was one of the few white kids around. This was the era of Black Power, and I saw and spoke to Panthers & members of the Nation of Islam on a daily basis. I also saw all the floppy-hatted pimps in their gangster rides, and had the same run-ins with the dealers and gangs that my black friends did (though undoubtedly aggravated by the fact that I stood out from the rest like a red-headed, freckle-faced, blue-eyed thumb).

When my friends & I went to the movies, it wasn't 'The Sound of Music' that was showing. It was 'Across 110th Street,' or 'Three the Hard Way.' The Man was always white, and the Brothers always came from behind to get over. Perhaps it was a little schizophrenic, but I always loved watching those blaxpoitation
classics as a kid. Even now, when I see their (rare) appearance on a video store shelf on on a late night cable listing, I feel a warm sense of nostalgia. Those movies may have been exploitative and may have disseminated stereotypes, but there was also a sense of brutal honesty there. They addressed the things my friends and I saw around us every day. They were fresh, and raw. They were art, as much as any of the other stuff I see touted as such these days.

The original 'Shaft' rocked. It was the undisputed king of the genre, just as 'Enter the Dragon' was to chop-sockey movies. Cut+Insert your own superlatives here. I KNOW you've seen it. It's like 'Star Wars:' EVERYBODY has. If you've been on another planet long enough NOT to have seen the original, do yourself the favor and do so.

Now there's the 'sequel', with Mr. Samuel L. Jackson in the starring role. I'll admit I rented the video prepared to be disappointed, but I wasn't. It stood up. I mean Mr. Jackson even had the Shaft WALK down: that quick, forward leaning swagger like a pimp John Wayne in a hurry to get off the cold streets to
somewhere safe, knowing he'd have to kick some serious ass to make it, and knowing there was some fine ass booty waiting for him when he finally shucked his coat. Jackson's Shaft was just as volatile & direct as Roundtree's original. The world it took place in was as cynical & corrupt as that of the original. Even the broad strokes delineating the racist members of the wealthy white elite (trying to keep the Brothers down) and the Cops who sell out the first time a (disgustingly small) wad of bills is waved under their
noses were in keeping stylistically with the blaxpoitation genre. Still, it was a lot gentler to white folks than the original, acknowledging that not all of us are blue eyed devils.

My understanding is that some people felt that Jeffry Wright's superb performance as Peoples was offensive and stereotypical. Well, sorry: blaxpoitation attempts to show it like it is.  Offensiveness & stereotypes were part of the technique used to show the world from a viewpoint many blacks may have found (and still find) accurate, a view of the world that accords with their own day-to-day reality. Be that as it may, Mr. Wright's performance was exemplary. My own favorite little touch is when, after he's smashed through a window with the Villain (the racist rich white boy) after he's stabbed the punk through the hand with an ice pick, he slips & almost falls on the pile of broken glass as he splits. Somehow that small gesture conveyed to me the runaway train that his (already unstable) character had become. My ONLY objection to the deliberate stereotyping was that Christian Bale, a fine actor ('American Psycho,' 'Empire of the Sun') almost sleep-walked through his role as the utterly reprehensible rich, racist, murderous, white, Walter Wade.

This sequel paid fitting tribute to the blaxpoitation classics. Any sense of cartoonishly broad strokes in describing character or milieu were deliberate, in homage to the genre. The car chases were exciting. The action sequences were adequate. The casting, direction, acting & cinematography were VERY good. It
conveyed the moral ambiguity that runs through a 21st Century American society where the color line between Black and White still exists.",1330214400,4,4142,4.714088397790055

Answer to L. Gontzes comment...I would assume the reason for there not being a nude scene with the lovely (not so lovely in this film) Vanessa Williams would have something to do with the fact that she was very much pregnant during filming! notice they tried not to shoot any shots of her from the waist down?

The acting is about average with the exception of Samuel Jackson who carries out his performance very well (as always), and Jeffrey Wright who really steals the show as Basquiat, the gangster.

Regarding the plot, it is weak; the chances that the character, Walter Wade Jr., would provoke and then deliver as he does are way beyond ""slim!""  The desperate need to demonize what W.W. Jr. represents gets tiring after the first 1000 or so movies!  Enough is enough!  The same applies for main characters with ""chips on their shoulders!""  Let's move on please!

As for having Vanessa Williams (who is GORGEOUS!) play in this film and not have a single nude scene (in this R Rated movie!) with her is such a WASTE!

1379796,5,B00004Z1FX,"Who delivers ten times out of ten?  The answer to is easy, only one man can, Shaft.  Throughout the 70's Richard Roundtree made a huge career playing that very man.  Now over 20 years later, Shaft is reborn, this time with Samuel L. Jackson taking over the title role.  Director John Singleton (""Boyz `N' the Hood"" and ""Four Brothers"") has taken Shaft out of the hip 1970's and into the year 2000 without the character losing any of his edge.

""Shaft"" is about detective John Shaft (Samuel L. Jackson), the coolest detective on the police force.  When the racist son (Christian Bale) of a powerful politician kills a young black man, Shaft will stop at nothing to bring the scum to justice.  There are two problems though; one the suspect has skipped the country, and two the only eyewitness (Toni Colette) has gone into hiding for her own safety.  To solve this crime Shaft is going to have to enlist the aid of his mentor/uncle, also named John Shaft (Richard Roundtree reprising his role from the original films), together with some other friends and people that owe him favors, Shaft will stop at nothing to ensure that justice has been served.

When another ""Shaft"" film was initially announced, many critics and fans simply wrote it off as another remake or another worthless sequel.  With director John Singleton swearing that this ""Shaft"" would not be just a rip-off of the movies from the 70's, but would in essence be a sequel set in the present day, and featuring a new Shaft.  This of course led to more criticism, until Samuel L. Jackson signed on, once that happened the critics were silenced and anticipation began to grow for this new `Shaft' film.  The story is fast paced and strong, and the idea of having the original Shaft, Richard Roundtree reprise his role, but is an uncle to Sam Jackson's younger Shaft, was a stroke of genius.  Fans of the original films were not disappointed by this newest sequel, and movie audiences that had never seen the original films had no problem following the storyline, since this was essentially a standalone movie.  The actors were all very good, Samuel L. Jackson never disappoints of course, and Christian Bale, Vanessa Williams, Richard Roundtree, and even Busta Rhymes all turned in solid supporting performances.

In the end, if you enjoyed the original series of `Shaft' films, or even if you've never seen them, but are interested in this one, you will not be disappointed if you choose to sit down and watch this modern version of Shaft.

Throw in some crooked cops and it's no surprise that the neighborhood has turned into a war zone by the end of the film.

This is a B-movie by A-list talent.  Director John Singleton, who also co-wrote the screenplay with the talented Richard Price, hews closely to the genre formula but elevates it with the aid of his top-notch cast.  One significant departure comes at the end, where the traditional action hero delivers the coup de grace, preferably to the accompaniment of a suitably contemptuous one-liner.  Singleton has something much more interesting and powerful in store.  The scenes between Wright and Bale--the tension between them and the way their characters jockey for the dominant position--are excellent.

This movie, directed by John Singleton, seems less black, more made-for-Hollywood. The plot is thin and unlike the original, the only love scene to be found is in pieces during the opening credits. And what was Busta Rhymes' purpose? It added nothing to the movie.

1379801,1,B00004Z1FX,"Samuel L. Jackson in Shaft could have been a great movie. He has the talent and skill to effectively play the role. Unfortunately, he is prevented from doing a giving a good performance because of the weak direction and script by Hack Extrodinare John Singleton. Someone please stop Mr. Singleton Before he directs again.
Singleton's terrible script and direction turns Shaft into a campy over-the top superhero movie instead of an intruigung murder mystery. Most of the characters come off like cartoonish stereotypes instead of real people the way they did in the 1971 original. Shaft fans know he is smart, smooth and clever; he's subtle about the way he does things. He's not a black batman wannabe as depicted in this film. Perhaps Mr. Singleton dreams of doing a Batman movie and thought he could apply those concepts here. He was sadly mistaken.
In the openeing scene he comes off as menacing and threatening, that he scares the witness even more and puts the white racist (Christian Bale) on the offensive by arresting him. A litle subtlety would have helped the story here and made the character more interesting. In the subplot our menacing shaft threatens a neighborhood drug dealer (Geoffrey Rush) and arrests him on some trumped up charges. While in jail the two consipire to find a witness who can finger Bale's character for the murder he committed. Sounds a lot like Batman Returns doesn't it? Just so he can have something to do, Shaft goes on a macho search to find the witness who can help his case. Personally, I think Singleton wanted to have a ton of frames of Sam Jackson looking cool in Armani leather. This goes on until the last act the movie which turns into a great big comic book action sequence chock full of shootings and mayhem. To conclude the story, the scene where Bale's character is coming to court to finally stand trial for his crimes is ripped straight from Mario Van Peebles ending scene of New Jack City.
Singleton wastes yet another opportunity and fails to utilize his cast of talented actors who do their best with his terrible script. Sadly, Gordon Parks, the man who wrote and directed the original Shaft was on set and Singleton did take the opportunity not pick his brain for ideas or even ask him what he was thinking when he set up certain scenes. This film would have been better if Singleton would have done thatn andjust STUDIED the films of this genere and understood the subtle nuances that make them work before starting this project. Then when he understood what made those films work he could then apply those approaches to his work. John Singleton needs to go back to film school. He still has a lot to learn about the craft of moviemaking.",1079654400,6,2700,4.710359408033827

I was very wrong. The movie is not without plot holes and implausibility, but it still works thanks to great acting and solid direction. John Singleton takes on a genre film with this almost-sequel to the famous blaxploitation series of the 1970s. Jackson plays John Shaft--nephew of the original Shaft who appears here as the wise old uncle. It's Richard Roundtree himself doing the honors, getting screen time in a theatrical release for the first time in decades.
The story concerns a cold murder of a young black man by rich and twisted Walter Wade, son of wealthy New York society. Christian Bale comes right off the set of American Pyscho and plays the demented Wade with a more outwardly tough guy persona. Think Bateman and the Preppie Murderer, and you get the idea. (Even the faux-Brooklyn accent is funny.)
There's not a whole lot of mystery around here. Shaft basically swears to get this guy, and we know he will, no matter no long or how many people he has to shoot. Things get complicated when Wade hires a Dominican drug lord to whack out the sole witness to the murder. The drug lord is then linked to dirty cops who get contracted to kill Shaft and the girl.
In the end, a lot of people die. Shaft has the best marksmanship of any cop in the country as he guns down countless low-rent drug dealers and various minions. And clad in Armani, the coat alone costing half a cop's yearly salary, Jackson is the ultimate in cool.
Why does it work? For one, the writing is slick, even if it's (trouble sign) done by a literal team of writers. However, it all comes together once we realize who was hired for what. Richard Price, author of Clockers and Freedomland, clearly lends some street credibility to the dialogue, although apparent on-set tensions meants Jackson was unwilling to read everyone's lines.
Also, the main difference between the old and new Shaft is the decided absence of sex. Jackson is a man of action. Matter of fact, the lone sexual encounter (implied and not seen) is forced, as if the audience needs a reminder that Shaft can, ahem, deliver. Also, the strangely blue-lit title sequence features quick flashes of nudity and implied sex, though we never see who with. Again, inserted by the filmmakers after production. (They couldn't get Jackson back for reshoots.)
But it doesn't matter. Shaft has the best lines, the steely stare, and a fast Glock. The other highlight is Jeffrey Wright as Peoples Hernandez, the drug lord who longs to be able to travel out of his neighborhood and still get respect.
This has a very New York feel to it, and there are tons of Manhattan locations. David Arnold, who updated the James Bond scores so well in the Brosnan films, does a very nice job of supplying detective music. (Issac Hayes' original Shaft is redone by Hayes himself, though hardly different.) Too bad the score is not widely available on CD.  You have to hunt for the limited edition disc that contains the entire score plus tracks not used in the final film.
The DVD is competent, including interviews, featurette, and music videos.
Highly recommended for those who like foul-mouthed tough cop movies where bad guys pay in the end.",1048982400,13,3393,4.692953020134228

Jackson was the saving grace of the movie, but it still isn't worth watching. I was very disappointed in how poorly it was made. Christian Bale delivered a cheesy and stupid performance, Toni Collete had a flat character, Vanessa Williams had kindof a pointless role, Dan Hedaya has had much better roles (Ransom, The Hurricane), and the only thing that seemed to come out of Busta Rhymes mouth every time that he spoke was the F word. Sam Jackson had a few cool lines, and he did the best that he could have with what they gave him, but it still didn't really work. This was a cheesy action movie. Although your kids would probably feel cool saying that they watched it, it is not something that they should see. The R rating is due to strong violence, pervasive strong language, and a brief sexual encounter. It isn't worth your time. For a good Samuel L.

I won't give away the plot, but the movie has a lot of action towards the last 25 minutes of the movie. The acting is pretty good, as is the direction by John Singleton. Samuel L. Jackson makes it seem like he was born to play the role.
The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was that it took a while to hit its stride. Instead of a much needed big shootout to open the movie, we get a very brief sex scene which better hold you off because there isn't any more action more another 75 minutes.

Jeffrey Wright and Busta Rhymes providing most of the comic relief.  It is interesting to note that Richard Rountree (the original shaft) and Gordon Parks (the original director) played parts in this film.
After watching this film, I can say I don't mind it.  I've seen a lot worse, and I've seen better.  Atleast with this film, you have Samuel Jackson playing another cool, suave character.  It's too bad Venessa William didn't play a more integral part to the story.  I would've liked to see a better dynamism between the two.  But then again Shaft has always been a lone-ranger of sorts.
This is not a plot-heavy story.  It's about a rich kid that murders an African American, but this crime is witnessed by a waitress who goes into hiding after being threatened.  Shaft is disheartened by the inadequacy of the system and decides to investigate on his own.  Like I said, not plot-heavy.

1379814,3,B00004Z1FX,"The line from Issac Hayes's original theme song goes, ""Who's the black private dick who's a sex machine to all the chicks?""  Well in this updated version, the answer is not ""Shaft"".  This John Shaft is not a private investigator, instead he is a member of the NYC police force.  Instead of being an ""anti-establishment"" outsider, he is now working for the ""Man"".  The new Shaft isn't that much of a ladies man either, and although he apparently does possesses the unspecified ""LD"", his amorous activities are limited to innuendo.  Times have changed.
Shaft 2000, is another movie that takes the name, and uses only trace elements of the original concept, to then create something that is pretty far removed from the original.  How much this matters, probably depends how much you enjoyed the original.  If the script was rewritten a bit, and the character Shaft renamed, this movie could still have been made under some other title.  The story is not proprietary to the character.
Samuel L. Jackson easily slides into the role of the redefined character, and delivers a typically solid performance.  As a cop, Jackson's Shaft is tough, cool, and for the most part, believable.  The character only occasionally strays into the ""cartoon zone"", even when the violence gets out of hand.

The central plot line, revolving around bringing a racist killer to justice, would run out of steam if a subplot involving a drug dealer were not introduced.  The drug angle, increases the level of action and violence.  The use of profanity is excessive and pervasive.  Like the original, race figures prominently in the story.  The ending may satisfy some, and dismay others, but that was the intention.  This film is elevated to slightly above average, only by Jackson's presence.
Homage is paid to the original Shaft, as Richard Roundtree makes a token appearance as John Shaft's uncle.  Actually, Roundtree is only six years older than Jackson is.  Billed second, Vanessa Williams is wasted in a rather limited role as a fellow police officer.
Ultimately, Jackson's triumph as Shaft may not be so much as cop over criminal, but in his ability to maintain some integrity in the character.  Sequel?  Can you dig it?",1013385600,,2201,4.929347826086956
1379815,2,B00004Z1FX,"2000 remake of the original 1971 blaxploitation film that disappoints on nearly every level despite the talent involved.  Samuel L. Jackson is nearly on autopilot as the NYC cop who nails a snooty racist (Christian Bale, back in ""American Psycho"" mode) for murdering a young Black man (Mekhi Phifer).  The film is really a generic vigilante crime drama, with little surprises and countless stereotypes; the most obvious of which is Jeffrey Wright's performance as a Dominican drug dealer.  Director John Singleton, who, quite frankly, hasn't done a good movie since 1991's ""Boyz N the Hood,"" has cheated the audience by releasing this shoddily-made film.  The only good thing about this film is that the Isaac Hayes theme song has been re-recorded almost exactly as is, without any modern touches.

Love the bit where he is told about a white man's brutal assault on an innocent black man and a look of self righteous disgust crosses his face and clearly Singleton expects us to feel the same. Black on black violence is condoned however, and is executed with glee. Preposterously, Shaft shoots no end of people dead in broad daylight without any sanction whatsover.
How about a more radical approach, like a white Shaft? Christian Bale looks sharp. A white Shaft who shoots other white people and looks digusted as a black man shoots an innocent white.

I just want to say that the leading man, Samuel L.Jackson made this film - not that it had a potential to be good - a really pathetic study in pretenciuosness and intellectual inferiority.
The ""cool cat"" who is supposed to be sleek, sharp-witted and subtly menacing looks like a schmoe. The lady's offer - the only one in the whole film - looks prepaid. His presense is the opposite of commanding - his eyes are always looking elsewhere and on the rare ocassions he stares at someone he is jittering and fretting - quite visibly. The body language is very endearing. When Mr. Jackson chases some crook you almost wish his prey will stop and let himself be taken to the precinct - out of pity to the non-athletic guy of advanced age. An Armani outfit on the police officer's limbs adds a touch of idiocy to these scenes.
Every time he attacks someone you can suspect that's purely personal - he overdoes it. These flaring nostrils, these eyes of the cornerered animal - not a big animal.
His adversary is equally schematic. Chrstian Bale was borrowed to show his sneering yippiesh self, to look hateful, to kill for no reason. The American Psycho Returns!
Evidently, that role will not peak the career of Samuel L.Jackson  and Christian Bale is participating only because he is not so famous yet to turn down the invitation to act in an obvious schlock.
That film is made just to fill in the studio's schedule, to make something with resonance, to target the generation which remembers the original Shaft and to attract the young ones who are curious what it was in their Dads' past.
I regret spending 100 minutes watching that. If you feel abused at the early stages of Shaft do not wait till the redeeming finale - there will be none.

Samuel L Jackson potrays the private dick that gets all the chicks, but there is something about him that is not so great. He just seemed like he did not want to be there. Was that due to the fact that we have seen this film before. The action and the plot have been in countless movies, so one movie that combines all of it is only tiring. Jeffery Wright got a lot of praise for his role as Peoples, the only problem with that was that he was terrible. He only muttered incoherently and did a very over stereotypical job of trying to potray another character that has been seen a hundred times before. Christian Bale was a much better villian that went completely over looked. He was not an original character in any way, but his acting was far superior to that of Peoples.
This film is an overall disaster. It is slow, and contains one too many things blowing up and far too many people getting shot. After 50 people or so, the effect is kind of lost.

1379830,4,B00004Z1FX,"Thirty years is a long time to wait to make a sequel, especially when no one is clamoring for one.  Director/Writer/Producer John Singleton decided it was about time.  The result is a solid, but undistinguished crime drama.  The elements of this story have been told so many times that they are becoming hackneyed.  A tough, no-nonsense cop fights evil and corruption to bring justice to the streets while often disregarding the law.  A spoiled rich kid is trying to get away with murder by hiring a drug dealer to snuff an eyewitness with the help of a couple of dirty cops.  This is not vanguard material.
Singleton's direction is good in the action sequences (of which there are plenty) and adequate in the dramatic scenes.  In this film, he doesn't bring much innovation to the screen, with very straightforward shots and mundane locations.  In an overly reverent gesture to the original film, he brings back Richard Roundtree (the original Shaft) as the current Shaft's (Samuel L. Jackson) uncle and mentor.  There is also a cameo appearance by Gordon Parks, the director of the original, and of course, Isaac Hayes theme song is back.
The film is elevated from mediocrity by the acting.  Samuel L. Jackson is an outstanding actor and slips on the character of this tough, streetwise cop like a tailored glove.  When he's bad, he's very very bad and when he is good, he's almost saintly.  Christian Bale also gives a fine performance as the despicable rich kid who thinks his wealth puts him above the law.  Jeffrey Wright is explosive as the egomaniac drug lord.  The supporting actors are also excellent.

The screenplay of SHAFT being as hollow as the ones we have to swallow by the dozen each year on television, I was hoping that John Singleton would adopt a different and maybe revolutionary style in his filmmaking in order to fulfill the hopes I had in his directorial skills.

It all starts with the assault (turned murder) of young African-American man outside an upscale nightclub. We know within five minutes of the opening credits who committed the crime (A rich spoiled white guy who's daddy would never let him go to jail.), so there is very little suspense or mystery there after. Soon you see Jackson in a courtroom consoling a woman you must assume is the murdered young mans mother. I say assume because they never actually tell you if she is or even what her name is. Fed up with the corruption surrounding this case and so many others Shaft quits the police force and vows to get justice his own way. From there the movie goes on to be confusing and way to hard to believe.
I expected much more from a movie with Sam Jackson in it, but I can't fault him because he didn't write, direct or produce it. You have got to love the addition of Richard Roundtree to the cast but, Vanessa Williams as a tough city cop? I am huge Vanessa Williams fan but come on people, lets at least try to keep it real. Overall Shaft is a huge disappointment, but I give it three stars for the presence Samuel L. Jackson brings to the screen and for including the real Shaft (Roundtree) in the film.",978480000,,1716,4.39937106918239
1379836,5,B00004Z1FX,"OK, so that's a rehash of one of the tag-lines (""Samuel L. Jackson. Shaft. Any Questions?"") but it seems to sum things up for me. This is probably the most fun I've had in a movie so far this year. I am a big blaxploitation fan, and Jackson is an actor that I will watch a mediocre movie just to see-especially if he plays a bada$$.
  I won't bother giving a plot sypnosis, except to point out that Jackson portrays not the original 70's Shaft, but Shaft's nephew, which I thought was a brilliant touch. The best part of that is, Richard Roundtree gets to reprise his role as the original, and they have some great scenes together. Some people have complained that Roundtree wasn't in the film enough. Though I wouldn't have minded if he'd been around more, I thought he had just the right amount of screen time and scenes. My favorite was when he visited a party thrown in Shaft's honor, has a nice talk with him, then leaves the Lenox Lounge with a foxy chick on each arm and a big smile on his face (not to mention being dressed to the nines). Besides, this movie belongs to Jackson, and he owns it completely. Though he's done many memorable roles, I think this will be the one he's remembered for.
  The supporting cast is great -Christian Bale and Jeffrey Wright both play thoroughly unlikeable yet entertaining bad guys, with Bale as a spoiled, racist yuppie and Wright as a drug dealer with an accent that makes Al Pacino's in Scarface sound whitebread.  This is a pretty testosterone-filled movie (not that there's anything wrong with that )so there's not an especially strong female supporting cast, but the women in the film are great. Gloria Rueben of ER has a nice cameo that I'm sure most actresses would have played for free, short though it is-in fact, they probably could have auctioned the small role she has off to the highest bidder. My only complaint is that they didn't get Pam Grier for a cameo- she would have been great in Vanessa L. William's role, but even more perfect as the bartender in the party scene.
  There's not enough room for me to list all the things I loved about the movie & admired the filmmakers for doing. However, some of the top ones: they use the ORIGINAL Isaac Hayes theme and not some horrible 'updated for the new millennium' remix, the way Shaft is especially furious about abuse of women and children, Busta Rhymes as Shaft's comic-relief sidekick, the fact that none of the good guys in the film ever refer to a woman as (synonym for female dog) or hoes, the way no theme or scene seems 'dated' (sadly, even today an interracial couple trying to have a nice evening on the town will still have to deal with racism) and the exceptionally satisfying way all the nasty characters get what is coming to them- justice is definitely served in the end. Man, I hope they make this into a franchise - the crowd-pleasing epilogue, with the theme music kicking in, definitely leaves room for one.
  I'm ripping off this comment from another review I read, but I have to repeat it: I'd happily pay the price of admission just to see Jackson read the phone book for 2 hours as this character. Needless to say, the movie is much more exciting than that. Action scenes are great, the plot was fine, even including twists I didn't expect, and the dialogue was perfect. Going to see the movie, I was a tiny bit concerned- as a lot of other fans probably were- that the character would turn into too much a caring, sharing watered-down Shaft, but no-one needed to worry. It would have kind of detracted from the character to see him hopping into bed with a different chick constantly throughout the movie like James Bond.
One of the few references to Shaft's sex life is also probably my favorite line in the movie. A good-looking female bartender, lonely not just for sex but for someone to hold her, is about to hook up with Shaft at the end of the party scene, telling him among other things that ""it has been a long time"". Shaft gives her a nice slow smile and replies as only Samuel L. Jackson can: ""You know me...It's my duty to please that booty.""

1379837,1,B00004Z1FX,"OK, it has been a couple months since I saw ""Shaft"" in the theater.  However, I distinctly remember laughing out loud at how stupid the plot was and how unrealistic some scenes were.  Samuel Jackson could have been great in this film if the script had been there (that is why I went to see it in the first place).  Unfortunately, the script is WRETCHED.  They could have come up with a more realistic and believable crime at the start of the movie to set the wheels of injustice rolling.  Do people really bludgeon other people to death on the street right outside a crowded bar because they are dissed in front of their friends?  When the first shooting/car chase takes place, you have to suspend your belief because it seems ridiculous.  The gangsters seem fake, and the relationship between Bale and the drug dealer rings as false as the ""count every vote"" mantra of good old Al G.  I wanted this film to be good, but alas I couldn't even find the silver lining.",977961600,3,965,4.474285714285714

1379839,1,B00004Z1FX,"This film had one thing going for it--it was completely laughable!  I thought it was a spoof like the naked gun series but then I read the box and it was a serious film.  What a joke.  The plot was non-existent.
The arch villian, ""peoples"" was an idiot.  The bonehead crooked cops couldn't catch a shoplifter if they cornered one in a K-Mart restroom.
Unbelievable....",977529600,,368,4.615384615384615
1379840,3,B00004Z1FX,"I have to say this movie isn't that big on plot. Its ok but thats not the high point of the film. Its pretty fun to watch Samuel L. Jackson go around in his suave stylish ways and fight crime in New York City. Jackson plays John Shaft, the nephew of the original John Shaft played but the man himself Richard Roundtree. Shaft is trying to get a man who two years ago killed another man over a racial issue into jail for good. All in all the plot is average but its just fun to sit and watch the fun. You don't have to see or even like the original Shaft movies which I haven't seen to see this. Jackson is great as Shaft. Isaac Hayes' theme is great, this time its redone. The dvd is half decent, it has the Shaft theme music video, a half decent featurette and some other features like cast interviews, a trailer, and other music videos. Rated R for violence, profanity, some nudity, and sexual innuendo.",977270400,7,905,4.236994219653179
1379841,3,B00004Z1FX,"Forget Russell Crowe.  Edward Norton?  I don't think so.  Nicolas Cage?  Yesterday's news.  The coolest guy working in movies today is Samuel L. Jackson, who embodies the term ""badass"" in the remake of ""Shaft"".  From the moment he's seen in silhouette during the opening credits, with Isaac Hayes' classic song booming in the background, he rivets the eye.  And he has his work cut out for him.  He rises above a mediocre script which alternates between excellent one-liners and the hoariest of cliches (it's hard to believe that John Singleton, who penned one of the best films of all time, ""Boyz In The Hood"", co-wrote this stuff) and pulls off a great performance.  The plot twists are telegraphed, the violence is at once cartoonish and unsettling, and there's a whole ""Starsky and Hutch"" feel to the production.  But this is Jackson's show, and it's obvious he had a blast doing this.  In a nice touch, Richard Roundtree, the original Shaft, shows up and matches Jackson for coolness.  Fast forward through Christian Bale's one-note performance (is it my imagination or is this guy starting to specialize in playing rich white-boy psychopaths?) and enjoy the rest of the show.",977097600,,1181,4.939086294416244
1379842,3,B00004Z1FX,"Samuel L. Jackson turns in a fun entertaining performance as the super cool ex-cop turns private eye like his great uncle played by the original shaft:Richard Roundtree(Earthquake, Q). The Plot:An young african man was murder by racist yuppie(Christian Bale), but his too powerful to touch, since his father is one of the richest man in new york. The witness(Toni Collette) is too scared to testify, she running from the law. Since he run away from the law also after his court day. Now two years later... He came back home to new york, shaft put the psycho in jail but he was relase from jail again but Shaft also has a problem with drug load(Jeffery Wright in a standout performance) wants shaft dead but the murderer yuppie helps the drug lord to put shaft down.
DVD has great widescreen (2.35:1) transer and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround also. But this special edition could have used more extras like Deleted Scenes(The scene where Jackson and Bale fighting eachother in a small airport), Audio Commentary from the director and cast. That could`ve being great on this DVD. An entertaining fun action to watch and see, a cool action film. Grade:B. Panavision.",976838400,,1160,4.863636363636363

Jackson does his usual super job and is still the coolest man in movies.  Singleton is still reaching to find that potential we all saw with ""Boyz in the Hood.""  Williams, not a bad actress, is wasted here and basically ignored.  The plot (with a Christian Bale doing a lousy impression of his American Pyscho character) is fairly weak.  Several other excellent reviewers have talked about it, but I never really bought it.  It is over the top, but is pretty dumb.  The action is not bad.  The music remains a highlight.  I hope, if there is a sequel to made here, that Richard Roundtree gets more screen time.  Dan Heyada is really funny.  Before you buy this, go see the original, now on DVD.

Jackson freedom to do what he does best in this film wich is not a remake of the original , but it does take place where Richard Rountree's charachter left  off Jackson presents Shaft for modern times as more volitale and firey then his predeccesor. When Shaft on assigment is called to  a crime scene of the murder of a young african amarican male he  begind to investigate the crime scene when he finds a rich man  playboy by the name of Walter Wade(Christian Bale) who is a man that is racist and can buy problems off with a whim. Shaft also  finds a key witness to the crime played by Toni Colette who has  been threatend by Wade not to mention the killing or she will , die. When Shaft takes wade in the courts seem to go easy on him  and set his bail for mere pocket change. Two years later Shaft  aids his partner in a neighborhood drug but they soon find the neighborhood kingpin played brillantly by Jeffrey Wright who , almost steals the movie with his disgusting at times humorous People Hernandez , at the drug but Shaft arrests People and  puts him behind bars in jail people and Wade meet and discuss  a deal to rub out the key witness , meanwhile tired of the way  justice is Shaft quits and takes matters into his own hands in  a great scene in the movie Shaft decides to take a break from  duty in the Lennox Lounge cameo's from the director of Shaft  the original and the one and only Shaft the original Richard  Roundtree is incredible to see completes the circle. Shaft's  partner played by Vanessa Willams tells him that he cannot do this case by himself they must use all there expereience and firepower to take down People Hernandez and bring in Walter  Wade and protect the witness so she can testify against him. In this explosive action blockbuster by Jhon Singleton whats  his name Shaft your damn right.
  Behind the scenes making of featurette and worth while cast  interviews and a great video by the man himself who made the searing soundtrack Isaac Hayes and a video from R Kelly and much more word is on the streets Shaft is back and he's badder then ever and he's still the coolest cat around with Samuel L. Jackson playing Shaft it's as every bit as raw and intense as the first  and original.",976665600,,2325,4.383177570093458
