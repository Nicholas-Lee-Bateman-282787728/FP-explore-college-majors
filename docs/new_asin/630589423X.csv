This is a different kind of production for Leigh, even so, I enjoyed it. It's as colorful as a Merchant-Ivory production and filled with plenty of good G&S music.",962582400,,300,4.189655172413793
1094431,3,630589423X,"Mike Leigh takes his first stab at directing a movie that does not deal with domestic crisis in smalltown England. Topsy Turvy is a completely  different direction for Leigh who for the most part manages to pull it  off.
Topsy Turvy is a historical film based on the lives of Gilbert and  Sullivan. The film never deals too much with their personal lives but  concentrates far more on their relationship as partners. Over the films  three hour period the two bicker relentlessly and are both shown to be  petty, resentful geniuses.
There is an awful lot to like like about  Topsy Turvy. Anyone interested in visuals like costumes, art direction and  cinematography is in for a real treat. For the most part the movie is a  genuine visual feast. Topsy Turvy won an Oscar for costumes which it did  entirely deserve.
The most satisfying aspect of the film lies in the  subtle relationship between Gilbert and Sullivan. Both are shown to be  pompous in their own right and while neither is portrayed as likeable  people, they are each charming in their own condescending ways. The scenes  in which they squabble are really brilliant. Neither one of them raises  their voices but each have a kind of snarky wit which works perfectly when  pitted against each other.
Looking at other reviews I have noticed many  ""5 star"" reviews. While the film is certainly good it is by no  means perfect. Often times the film seems lumbersome and tiring and at  three hours long Topsy Turvy loses its charms after a while.
Topsy Turvy  is clever and visually wonderful. It is overlong for sure but is worth  seeing at least once. ""Secrets and Lies"" was still better.",959731200,3,1648,4.712280701754386
1094432,5,630589423X,"Mike Leigh gives modern significance to Gilbert and Sullivan with his film Topsy-Turvy.  Gilbert and Sullivan musicals seem horribly dated to modern sensibilty, but Leigh surpasses such thought to deliver a film showing that  theater really hasn't changed much in the past hundred years. Leigh  portrays life in the theatre more accurately than any other film released  in the past few years.  We see the entire arch of the creative process in  developing a work of theatre.  From the difficulty of collaborating to  write a piece of theater, the back-stage alliances against the director, to  the endless (and I mean ENDLESS) rehearsal process where you are forced to  read lines again and again in a confined space, Leigh is dead on the money  throughout.  Anyone who has taken part in theatre (from playing the star in  the christmas pagent, to starring in a broadway show) would appreciate this  film.  Other than that, the film is beautifully filmed with vibrant color  to parallel the crazy atmosphere of Gilbert and Sullivan's work.  Costuming  is exquisite, especially the ""Three Little Maids"" scene.  Wonderful ensemble of actors, check out the scene where Gilbert is sitting  on his bed talking to his wife, it's just beautiful.  I highly recommend  this film, it is one of Leigh's best films, and one of the best films of  1999.",959472000,29,1339,4.959276018099548

And I knew nothing about the lives of the two---had to keep reminding myself ""which one was Gilbert...etc.""  And...I thoroughly enjoyed this film!

There's a lot to like on so many different levels:  the acting is superb, the costumes and sets are perfect, the musical productions are a total delight and the back stories are very interesting.  I enjoyed seeing, not only the struggle between the two principles, but the glimpses of the lives of the supporting characters.  Gilbert's wife is perfectly lovely and almost heartbreaking in her personal struggle with living with him.  Sullivan's relationship with his mistress is equally ""interesting"" as she informs him, quite unemotionally, about her pregnancy, apparently not the first by him.  The glimpses of the actors' personal lives are shown, too.  Mike Leigh does a good job of not telling too much.  We see one woman having a terrible sore on her leg bandaged and later asks if she might use her cane. One brilliant fellow injects himself with drugs while another actress gets her courage from alcohol.  The contrast between their private problems and their perfect onstage performances is quite touching.  Again Mike Leigh shows just enough and doesn't preach.

The scenes from the performance of The Mikado are worth the price of admission, alone.  They are visually yummy, not to mention the sheer pleasure of the wonderful lyrics and music.  I think I can no longer claim not to be a Gilbert and Sullivan fan...I'm on my way to get a DVD of The Mikado.",1374969600,2,1681,4.842105263157895

Although specifically about G & S and THE MIKADO, it is really an excursion into what goes into mounting a production of any stage work, and all the things that can go wrong.  Interesting to note that these were two British gentlemen who came together and made great music, and a century later, two other  British gentlemen, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, came together and made more great music!  ""Topsy-Turvy"" is an utter delectation, especially for Savoyards, like myself, but really for everyone else, too.  Highly recommended!",1354752000,,652,5.0
1094750,4,630589423X,"Having seen The Mikado years ago in the Savoy Theatre in London, and having been a longtime G&S fan, I expected to love this movie, and I did.  It's all about the less-than-warm working relationship between lyricist Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and composer Sullivan, who can't agree on their next subject, leading their theatre manager friend, Richard D'Oyly Carte, to fear that their profitable partnership has run its course.  But then Gilbert is inspired by a Japanese exhibition in London to set their next musical farce in the fictional town of Titipu, Japan, populated by the usual G&S figures - the bumbling official, the unattractive spinster trying to land her man, the lovesick tenor.

Sullivan is a suave, cool sophisticate, Gilbert a dour curmudgeon who pours out his grumpiness toward human stupidity by writing some of the funniest lines ever written.  Jim Broadbent is wonderful as Gilbert, who taxes the patience of his longsuffering wife and runs the production like a benevolent dictator, respected if not exactly adored by the cast.  G and S two don't particularly like each other and have nothing in common, but once Gilbert starts cranking out his comical lines, Sullivan quickly gets inspired, and they create The Mikado, which has probably provoked more laughter than any musical ever written.

Although The Mikado itself is a farce, the movie itself isn't - meaning, instead of riotous, knee-slapping humor, the laughs in the movie are more low-key - for example, in one scene the women in their dressing room are fretting because they won't be able to wear their corsets under the Japanese costumes, while the men in their dressing room are fretting over . . . not being able to wear their corsets.  The young tenor who plays Nanki-Poo is worried that, as a ""respectable married man"" he will be exposing his calves on stage.  Three Japanese women are brought in to teach the female cast members the ""Japanese walk,"" but it's discovered that Japanese women walk just like English women.  There's some warmth mingled with the comedy too: The stocky actor playing the Mikado has a scene cut, sheds tears, and the whole cast gets so distraught that they beg Gilbert to restore the scene, which he does.

In fact, much of the pleasure is seeing the stage and backstage world presented in such colorful detail, inevitably leading the audience to wonder how the play will fare when it's finally staged.  And of course, there's the incomparable pretty-witty songs, treasures of English-language theatre.  The movie also has a delightful ""feel"" to it, very different from some of the pretentious Merchant-Ivory productions with their oppressive snob atmosphere.

A few minor complaints: the movie would probably be rated G, except that apparently the producers decided to spice it up with a scene early in the movie where Sullivan visits a French whorehouse, where we see two bare-breasted trollops singing a song.  Near the end of the movie we hear Sullivan and his longtime mistress discussing his paying for an abortion (although it's so low-key some viewers may not catch it).  I would like to have seen the movie end up with a big bang-up production number, but it sort of peters out at the end.

Not a perfect movie, and certainly not for all tastes, but if you like history recreated in loving detail, there is no better movie about London and its theatre world in 1880s.  G&S fans are certain to like this, even if the script takes a few liberties here and there with history.  The movie is about 3 hours long, but so what?  Pour yourself some sherry (mix with sweet vermouth for a ""merry widow""), settle into a comfy chair, and escape into a kinder, gentler world full of music and color.  The kids wouldn't like it, and the spurting-blood-and-car-crash bubbas would be bored stiff, but for its select audience, it's a real gem.",1351555200,,3849,4.892307692307693

1094837,5,630589423X,"Bottom line first:  If you are a Savoyard, you may need extra copies as you wear them out from watching. If you are new to these iconic comics, maybe what follows will help you to understand and buy.

It may not be easy to grasp just how important the musical team of Sir Author Sullivan (lyricist) and the eventually Sir William Gilbert (librettist) were in the late Victorian Era. It is possible that if there were a sound track to this period, it would be a mashup of G and S  music.

Item: The Savoy Theater, located in the heart of London's theater district (The Strand) was the first theater built with electric lighting was built from the proceeds of the various G and S operettas
Item: The Savoy Hotel near the Strand in London, was the first hotel to feature in room bathrooms, and is still known for its luxury, was build on the proceeds of ...  (Take a guess)
Item: Some of the world's first, international copy write laws came into existence because of American pirating of Gilbert and Sullivan names, themes and music. It may still be true that recordings of the Mikado may not include both the full music and text.
Item: After the Mikado every stylish home, including Teddy Roosevelt's White House boasted a Japanese themed, ""Mikado"" room.
Item: To this day, Gilbert and Sullivan Societies worldwide stage their comic operettas. I have seen or heard of such societies in America from Philadelphia to Houston, From Biloxi to San Francisco.

Of more contemporary interest is that all of the G and S collaborations were intended to poke fun at Victorian Society. None more so than the Mikado. It is believed that The Queen took offense at the satire in Mikado, having decided that the Mikado (ruler of Japan) was her satiric image.. Even so the action taken was that Gilbert would not be knighted until 6 years after her death.

A society that can so lavishly reward those who poke fun at that society has to be very self confident. The contrast with modern sensitivities, so willing to use violence, or threaten violence against those who fail to be more reserved in the use of free expression is stark.

And so to this movie:

Topsy Turvy is a movie about the writing, collaboration and staging of the Mikado. This means there are two parallel plot lines.
The portrayal of the creation of the operetta is slightly romanticized but in board strokes correct. G and S had reached a point where only the deft diplomacy of impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte would keep the partnership from collapsing. There was a sense that they had exhausted their creativity and gone stale.

Elsewhere the Japanese were making their first effort to become a world power and as such things Japanese were becoming fashionable. Popular myth has it that William Gilbert, attending the first World's Fair in London, was inspired to use the highly stylized traditions of Imperial Japan as the setting for his satire on Victorian manners. This is the version is maintained in this movie.

One of the achievements of this movie is the skill by which we see the personality of G and S, the personalities of the leading performers and production staff. Even as the Director - Mike Leigh successfully juggles so many performers, the staging and costumes are brilliant.  Feel free to re read that last statement inserting the real life figures portrayed by Allan Corduner (Sullivan) , Jim Broadbent (Gilbert) and Ron Cook (D'Oyly Carte)

Side note: In the original 1885 production Gilbert had all his costumes designed strictly from actual Japanese kimonos and the movie scenes of his insistence on authentic fan work and stageing are historically correct.
Second Side note: Such a contrast between modern stick figure pretty chorus lines and the more widely varied figures leading ""artistic verisimilitude"" to the Victorian stage.

As for the plot of the Mikado, two quotes should be sufficient to grasp the comedic center:
Our great Mikado, virtuous man,
When he to rule our land began.
Resolved to try
A plan whereby
Young men might best be steadied.
So he decreed, in words succinct,
That all who flirted, leered, or winked,
(Unless connubially linked),

Should forthwith be beheaded

And so Flirting is now a capital Crime. The people of TittyPo, not wishing to enforce this law, and not wishing to directly ignore the Mikado write a separate law. This law requires strict enforcement of the sequence of decapitation, such that the second in line cannot be beheaded before the first:

And so we straight let out on bail
A convict from the county jail,
Whose head was next
On some pretext
Condemned to be mown off,
And made him Headsman, for we said
"" Who's next to be decapited
Cannot cut off another's head
Until he's cut his own off *

Add into this mix the fact that the Mikado's son (NankiPo) is disguised as a wandering minstrel and seeking his love, YumYum.. He is also avoiding Katisha, who believes herself engaged to NankiPo . Add that YumYum is ward of  the aforesaid condemned convict, turned Lord High Executioner (KoKo)  and topsy turvy ensues.

Given that the operetta is entirely Victorian in its view point, a long ago girl friend of mine pointed out that the women of this operetta are not weaklings. This movie ends with a heart rending rendition by the play's leading lady declaring of herself and the sun:
I mean to rule the earth as he the sky,
we really know our worth the Sun and I...

In a recent live performance by the Houston Gilbert and Sullivan Society, the actress in this role nearly blew the doors off, while singing this same selection and seated on the stage floor.

The movie does not so much replay the musical highlights of the operetta as deconstruct the order of them in support of the themes in the movie. Characters are complex and you will have to be an active watcher.
The overall richness of this movie will mean that you may find your self still seeing and hearing new things after several re plays. A valid case for buying this movie is that it is still a pleasure after several viewings.",1347667200,2,6018,4.721374045801527

I never expected it would. Movie biopics always embroider when they do not completely falsify biographical facts - e.g., The Great Caruso which bears little or no resemblance to the actual facts of the tenor's life but was hugely enjoyable anyway and inspired a generation of singers, including by his admission Jose Carreras. Actually, Topsy Turvy sticks closer to the facts - the general outline is true enough, even if some of the details are maybe skewed in the telling. But the performances, especially of the Mikado, are as good as they get. For historical accuracy and really serious analysis, read Carolyn Williams' superb Gilbert, Sullivan, and Gender, Genre, Parody (2010).

1094841,5,630589423X,"Topsy-Turvy has turned my expectations upside-down. Who would've thunk that a 3 hour film about Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and Sullivan (Allan Corduner), the lyricist and composer respectively of such light opera trifles as H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance, and The Mikado, would be so thoroughly engaging? And judging from the whimsical lyrics, I would've thought that Gilbert would be the silly and light hearted one, while Sir Arthur Sullivan would be stern and austere. But the opposite was true: Gilbert was the fuddy duddy, stick-in-the-mud, wet blanket, while Sully was an unabashed hedonist. True, Sullivan did have higher ambitions as a composer, and wanted to write a grand opera instead of the light operas that filled the Savoy Theatre night after night, but other than that one little quirk, he was a lover of wine, women, and song.

Topsy-Turvy divides easily into two parts--the topsy and the turvy, as it were: The first part shows the company struggling to fill the theatre night after night, in spite of atrociously hot weather, and a certain ennui that has the audience staying home in droves. Gilbert seems to be writing the same libretto over and over, the only difference being in 1881, it was about a magic coin; and before that it was a magic lozenge; and in 1877 it was an elixir, and in this latest instance it is to be a magic potion. Sullivan mutinies against Gilbert's world of topsy-turvydom, proclaiming he is being treated as a barrel-organ. You have but to turn his handle, and Hey Presto! Out pops a tune.

Gilbert is in a quandary until, reluctantly, he visits a Japanese Exposition and is inspired anew. Thus the second part details the excitement of mounting a production of The Mikado, a musical that will become wildly successful. It is said that the sun never sets on The Mikado, as somewhere in the world, there is always a production of it running.

-------------------
Gilbert: There's something inherently disappointing about success.
====================

Mike Leigh directs Topsy-Turvy with great attention to historical detail--not with merely corroborative detail, intended to give artistic verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative--but with a full palette, from bold to drab, clearly painting the London theatre milieu. The musical numbers are presented in a variety of views: in rehearsal, or being composed, backstage, from the audience's view, or from the performers. Leigh shows not just the show, but all the work and worry that went into the show, and all the backstage drama of a group of players.

For them, the real news of the day is not the Fenian bomb, but that both George Grossmith (Martin Savage) and Rutland Barrington (Vincent Franklin) are off tonight because of a luncheon of bad oysters. The tragedy of Richard Temple (Timothy Spall) is that Gilbert had the temerity to cut his big number as The Mikado in a show entitled The Mikado just before opening night. Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), the impresario, must reprimand lead soprano Leonora Braham (Shirley Henderson) about her little weakness, though she really does believe that her behavior this last year has been exemplary. Meanwhile, John D'Auban (Andy Serkis), Choreographer, hasn't laughed so much since his tights caught fire in ""Harlequin Meets Itchity Witch and the Snitch"".

But through it all the show must go on. There is the music to bind them together, and as Sullivan, the composer, reminds them before the performance: ""Voce, voce, voce."" Latin for ""Voice, voice, voice"" it's a reminder of the primacy of singing to the success of his music and the show.

The bottom line is that Topsy-Turvy is a superb film, and it will keep you enthralled throughout its 3 hour length. Even if you THINK you are not a fan of the light operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, you'll find it fascinating. Excellent direction from Mike Leigh. Timothy Spall, as Richard Temple / The Mikado, and Martin Savage, as George Grossmith / Ko-Ko, shone brightest among an ensemble of stars; while Jim Broadbent as W. S. Gilbert and Allan Corduner as Sir Arthur Sullivan turned the whole film topsy-turvy.

1094842,3,630589423X,"I was a little disappointed with this movie, but I suspect my expectations were set too high based on some glowing reviews that led me to buy it.  However, it's the kind of movie I think I'll appreciate more on repeat viewings (it is very long, there are many characters to keep track of - often in different costume, making it hard to remember who's who - and many subtleties to pick up on).  It bore resemblance to other movies about musical genius (Amadeus, especially in the opening and conducting scenes; Immortal Beloved and Copying Beethoven - all great movies to emulate, by the way).

The movie felt a bit choppy, and I watched many scenes wondering what they contributed to the story and why they were included.  It's almost as if someone thought ""let's include this!  Oh, and let's include that!,"" but then these disparate vignettes weren't stitched together very well to make them flow better, and the result was an overly long movie that leaves you with many questions.  There seemed to be too much unnecessary detail at times, yet not enough at others.  Basically, the movie could have benefited from better editing, both for length and content.  To give one glaring example, Sullivan was adamant in refusing to write any more music for comic operas and steadfast in his desire to write serious ones.  This stumbling block between the two geniuses was noted over and over.  Yet, Sullivan seems to miraculously come around and embrace The Mikado, giving up on his serious objections to the genre.  By what process did that transformation happen when he was so stubborn earlier?  This is central to the story and yet is not really explained aside from one scene where Sullivan apparently likes the new libretto (but why when it's not much different from the others???).

Having done all that nitpicking, I must say this film has many pluses - not the least of which is the beautifully rendered music, the extended live performance numbers, the great singing (which some have complained about but I found it marvelous and highly recommend the soundtrack), the opulent costumes, magnificent sets and excellent cast.  Visually it reminds me a bit of Moulin Rouge in its overall lushness.  The period setting is also of great interest (has anyone ever explored the pitfalls of the just-invented telephone before, or the marvel of the ""reservoir pen"" with its own ink?)

Perhaps there is just too much going on in this movie to adequately absorb in one setting.  Therefore, I am watching it again - which, come to think of it, is pretty high praise for any movie.  So ultimately, I must recommend.  Eventually, you'll probably love it.",1255824000,,2642,4.831111111111111
1094843,5,630589423X,"If you are a Savoyard you absolutely must have this film. It is true to the G&S history involved as nearly as I can tell. The company members depicted in the film are actually that and some even look like photos I have seen from that era. The Mikado related story also is quite true from what I have read elsewhere. Aside from the musical related material the insights into both men's private lives are well done and rather touching. So, Topsy Turvy is a must for anyone with G&S ties.",1251763200,2,485,4.34065934065934

I enjoyed the portrayls of daily life in the Victorian Era, but that aspect of the film may not be enjoyed by all. The one complaint I've heard about this film is that it is ""too slow.""

In my opinion the movie really hits its stride when it talks about the making of Gilbert and Sullivan's famous operetta, ""The Mikado."" The scenes that describe the reactions of those in Victorian England to Japanese culture are the most amusing in the film.

""Topsy Turvy"" also features actors who do their own singing, which for the most part is quite impressive.  The scenes that feature actual moments from various operettas are amongst my favorites. I have loved this movie since I first saw it in 1999, and its a shame its out of print and become harder to get a hold of.",1238544000,2,902,4.377245508982036

1094930,5,630589423X,"For me one of the most engaging moments in the film is when Gilbert, played by Broadbent, encounters Japanese Kendo fighting and especially Japanese theater.  This is set up as a prelude to suggesting that an exhibition of Japanese culture Gilbert attends starts him off thinking up the Mikado. Whatever the intentions Broadbent's reactions as the camera focuses on his reactions to the unfolding drama in the play demonstrate in a completely convincing way how a Victorian Londoner would react to a (Noh?) play.  He utterly and with an exquisite degree of facial movement replicates a man who doesn't understand the drama he is watching, can barely relate to it, or can only respond to it as a Victorian might, but respects it.  Broadbent's depiction of a Victorian popular artist thinking through the artistic problems brought about in a visit to a Japanese exhibition is spellbinding but minutely subtle.  Broadbent was Victorian.  Remarkable work...",1225152000,3,953,5.162337662337662

The Mike Leigh directed `Topsy Turvy' shows what should be possible for an entire version of `The Mikado' and it is only frustrating that the brief excerpts shown during this fascinating biography do not exist in an extended form. This engrossing movie seems to capture the idiosyncrasies of the two main characters perfectly and the fact that some considerable time is spent showing how `Three Little Maids' and `I am the Lord High Executioner' may have been developed, only gives us more opportunity to watch the skill of the actors getting to grips with this quintessentially English opera.",1200009600,3,821,5.0

is easy; nothing is farther from the truth. This movie puts you into the opera company. Be warned, it is highly addictive!",1179014400,2,339,4.380952380952381
1094933,5,630589423X,"In my opinion, Topsy-Turvy is one of the best movies of the past 30 years, and what makes it an even more important artistic achievement is that it is still such an unknown and underrated film. Director Mike Leigh brings out the whimsical beauty and genius of Gilbert & Sullivan and charms you into believing that these lovely scenes is what their theater company was like 100 years ago in London. The musical numbers and stage acting inside the movie are wonderfully pleasing, and make you wish that Leigh could film every one of G&S's other plays so we could enjoy them all with equal pleasure. You have to believe that G&S would be happy having Leigh manage all of their modern revivals, Topsy-Turvy makes The Mikado so lovely, exquisite and captivating, that the 3 1/2 hour movie feels like a leisurely slice of heaven. And the glimpses into Gilbert & Sullivan's eccentric private lives illustrate the many facets of both their genius and their capacity for frivolity. All in all, Topsy-Turvy is an exquisite film that didn't get the attention and many accolades it deserved, yet it is a film that must not be missed by any serious film fanatic.",1176508800,9,1149,4.721393034825871
1094934,5,630589423X,"This film is a feast both for the eyes and the ears. The costumes and settings allow us a glimpse into upper middle-class life in Victorian England. Every detail, from the box on a tall pole that was a telephone to the ladies' pendulous wire-framed bustles, is perfect.

Although the principal story, about the tension between Sir Arthur Sullivan, who thought he ought to be writing more serious music than tunes for the topsy-turvy lyrics of his collaborator, W.S. Gilbert, is interesting, the secondary story of the preparation and performance of ""The Mikado"" is not only compelling but also delightful to behold. The rehearsal scenes are particularly engaging, as are the personalities of the performers--the tenor, who does not want to go onstage without his corset; the baritone whose feelings are hurt when his solo is cut; the soprano with her little drinking problem; and the patter-performer with an even more serious addiction. Their characters are developed so beautifully that one begins to care intensely about what happens to them.

This beautifully-directed and well-acted film excels on almost every level. Some DVD's should be passed swiftly on to friends (or enemies, depending on the quality of the product). This one, however, is a keeper!",1176422400,11,1259,5.166666666666667

1094936,5,630589423X,"Mike Leigh's films are usually of the ""kitchen sink"" variety, showing middle class/working class people in the U.K., and their trials and tribulations in dealing with life.  Here he does something quite different, and the results are astounding.  This is my favorite Leigh film, a complete departure for him, and one in which he triumphs brilliantly.  As other reviewers have noted, this is a backstage drama of Gilbert and Sullivan putting on one of their most famous operas, The Milkado.  It really captures the time period brilliantly, and it shows how much time, energy, and stamina is put into putting on any production.  Another pleasure I get from this film is the language.  Everyone in the film is so incredibly well spoken.  After nearly 20 some odd years of having to listen to Hollywood film butcher the English language (and some British ones too, no doubt trying to emulate the stupidity of Hollywood), it's lovely to hear English as it should be spoken.  Yes, I am sounding a bit snobbish, but I don't care.  It's bloody lovely, it is.  The film is beautifully designed, directed, shot, and the performances are wonderful.  The leads are perfect (Jim Broadbent as Gilbert, and Allan Courdier as Sullivan), but every role is indeed perfect here.  The casting is impeccable.  This is a wonderful film, one that can be experienced over and over again.",1174694400,8,1363,4.899563318777292
1094937,5,630589423X,"TOPSY-TURVY is a superior film...so let's start there!

Sometimes one watches a film because of the actors,or the director,or perhaps the composer, set designer or art director. I do so for all reasons. But did you ever watch a film for it's camera operator???

DICK POPE is my all time favorite cameraman/director of cinematography. Pope is known as an expert in the field of ""period lighting"", and to see his extensive film credits shows his genius at the art of shades and shadows. Pope is so knowledgeable about lighting and how it should be photographed, whether gaslight,candlelight or natural light, that his projects have a tremendous glow about them and a authenticity that other cameramen simply must stand back and learn! To see a Dick Pope-shot film is to behold a Rembrandt or a Seurat in an art gallery.

TOPSY-TURVY excels in all areas recognized by the Academy of Arts and Sciences for film achievement, but it goes beyond all those areas for it's visual sumptuousness that is Dick Pope.

Other Dick Pope films to marvel would be THE ILLUSIONIST,VERA DRAKE, NICHOLAS NICKLEBY, SWEPT FROM THE SEA, DEADLY VOYAGE, THIRTEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT NOTHING, MAN OF THE YEAR, SECRETS AND LIES and AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE. They are all worth it!",1171929600,5,1252,4.947619047619048
1094938,5,630589423X,"Let's face it, this film was made for the fans.  The fans of a very specific niche genre: Gilbert & Sullivan, and in particular, ""The Mikado"".  And that's very cool with me, because I am a lifelong G&S lover, and ""The Mikado"" has a special place in my heart amongst all thier luminous works.  And if you are not among the fans, you may not enjoy this movie quite as much - it may also make you curious enough to investigate further, and become a fan yourself.

This is a pretty accurate telling of the story of the making of ""The Mikado"", one of the most charming works of the 19th century theater, and which uis still popular today.  The film is truly fascinating, and for those of us weaned on the D'Oyly Carte opera Company, all the familiar people are there: George Grossmith, Richard Temple, Durward lely, Rutland Barrington, Jessie Bond and the rest.  It is a moment of infinite joy.

There are, alas, a couple of very minor quibbles.  The personalities of Gilbert and Sulivan themselves are a bit misleading.  I know, for instance, of no occasion in which Sullivan arranged for abortions for his mistress, and Gilbert is show here to be so uptight that his marriage is virtually sterile.  Neither of these men were as bad as this, and I am sorry the film writers chose to show them in such unsavory light.  However, like the Pirate King, I will look over it.  And like jack Point, I will let that pass.

Buy this one for sure, and enjoy it over and over.  It is one of those films i can't seem to ever get tired of.",1171843200,5,1522,4.370106761565836
1094939,5,630589423X,"Topsy-Turvy! As a title this is a tribute via cross-reference and double-meaning, and is certainly an apt name for this movie. This is the behind the scenes story of the feuds, the obsessions, the hard work, the tears and the triumphs that ultimately produced Gilbert and Sullivan's most enduring musical, The Mikado. It is a tale of geniuses collaborating and vying, of cultural differences, of civilizations meeting, of drug addicted actors and alcoholic actresses, of mistresses and prostitutes, wives and lovers, and long-winded tales told amid gluttonous revelry in gentleman's clubs even as poverty of the most bleak kind lies right outside the door. It is funny, it is daring, it is engrossing, and once or twice it is maddening. It is the tale of the things the public never gets to see in the time leading up to opening night of a major stage show.

Beyond the fine story, what I also liked about this Mike Leigh film was how everything we saw during its running-time looked authentically Victorian. That's significant, because most often what we get in movies is a sort of modern impression of a Victorian world, but not here in this surprise gem. From gas-lit stages to makeup (or its lack) in keeping with the 1880's, syntax, attitudes, and clothing, nothing that I found onscreen looked  anachronistic to my eye. This is a complete immersion in another time and place, the English stage in the late 1800's. Here a viewer who is careful to notice small details is rewarded for the effort.

As the story is told of the uneasy collaboration between those two geniuses of operetta, William Gilbert, and Arthur Sullivan, one a self-doubting egocentric, the other a complacent hedonist, a partnership that ultimately produces the immortal Mikado, a viewer is dragged along on a trip across multiple levels of British society, and comes away knowing the characters here in an unusually intimate way. We become privy to their secrets about their lives, their longings, their terrors. We see how even the most successful projects must pass through the threat of extinction as they climb from concept to reality. And lastly, we take a trip back in time. Or it sure seems that we do.

With its tasteful use of Gilbert and Sullivan songs at just the right moments, its talented cast, its authenticity to its era, and for much else, Topsy-Turvy deserved more than critical recognition, it deserved an Oscar.",1168387200,13,2407,4.921182266009852

Director Michael Leigh brings to life the world of Gilbert and Sullivan's 1880's London and the Savoy/West End theater district. Jim Broadbent and Allan Corduner star as the illustrious librettist/composer team. The rest of the actors are actual Gilbert and Sullivan singers and lesser known British actors (like the Amazon.com Product Review states you won't find Helena Bonham Carter, Rupert Everett, Ian McKellen, Judi Dench or any such notable British actor in this one). The strength of this film lies in the stunning cinematography which vividly depicts the time period. The music is of course, wonderfully rendered. The plot is actually drawn from the actual historical account of how G&S's ""Mikado"" was made. After the failure of ""Princess Ida"" a Medieval fantasy-opera, Gilbert and Sullivan are bent on making one operetta that can make them or break them. While Gilbert favors another magical opertta ""The Potion"", Sullivan wants to compose something new and fresh. He is also tired of having to compose light, uncomplicated music when he would prefer to compose symphonies or serious concerti. They argue and fight and almost break up their relationship at work. But Gilbert buys a Samurai sword from a Japanese community in London and is inspired. Their subsequent creation - The Mikado, arguably their greatest piece, certainly their one operetta that has stood the test of time. It's a pleasure to see these down-to-earth actors living their roles. We are in Victorian London, witnessing the creative process and the complicated process of casting, direction and composition for an operetta. The finale is very moving. This movie is rather long, and many scenes drag on, and often it's talky, but it's as good as any traditional historic costume. Jim Broadbent, especially, is doing a terrific job. Broadbent played Harry Zidler, the circus-like Impresario of the 2001 film Moulin Rouge with Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor. This is a terrific movie and I highly recommend it to fans of Gilbert and Sullivan.

But the only nice thing I can say is that the sets were absolutely gorgeous.  I spent most of the movie thoroughly confused, frustrated and increasingly angry, because there were so many scenes that made no sense at all. In the opening scene, Sullivan seems to be deathly ill, but we are never told what's the matter with him -- then halfway through the movie he seems to have made a miraculous recovery (no explanation) -- then at the end he seems to be sickly again.  Huh? At one point the producers have a stern discussion with one of the actresses, warning her that ""We don't want any more trouble with you this year..."" -- and we have no idea what the ""trouble"" was.  At the Japanese exhibition, Gilbert runs into some people whom he clearly knows, but we're not told WHO these people are (his in-laws) until much later.  And during the scene where the actors are feasting on oysters in a restaurant, what the HELL was that subtitle on the screen telling us that ""At this time the Boer War was raging and General XXXX was invading XXX country...""  It had no relevance to anything!  It's as if Mike Leigh made the movie for people who are already experts on G&S's lives and on that period of history!  Or else someone decided to shorten the movie by chopping out earlier scenes that would have given you some history and cleared up all the confusion.

Gilbert, at his wife's insistence, attends a Japanese expo, and this leads to the fabulous new, ornate idea of The Mikado. The film is lush, fantastic and spectacular.

1095008,5,630589423X,"We're in the mid-1880s. W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan's collaboration is going through a bad patch. Their latest work, `Princess Ida', has failed to repeat their earlier triumphs. Sullivan is fed up and wants to go and write something terribly serious instead of all this silly light opera. Gilbert comes up with a new text but Sullivan is not interested. He refuses to set it. Gilbert refuses to shelve it and start from scratch on something new. Things are looking grim. Then Gilbert is persuaded to attend a big new exhibition of things Japanese... The rest is history.

And splendid history beautifully brought to the screen. People tend to love or hate G&S. I guess I used to be a hater but chucked it in: looking down one's nose at this shamefully middle-class, shamefully middle-brow jollification is easy and quite satisfying but also, let's face it, silly, precious and curmudgeonly: it's all just undeniable splendid fun. But even if you aren't crazy for G&S you'd be hard pressed to dislike this: one of the most intelligent recreations of London at the high water mark of the Victorian era, limited though it evidently is by budgetary constraints that ensure the entire film (almost) is composed of interior shots. The writing and acting is miraculous, and we see right past the strange clothes, petticoats and silly moustaches to vividly real people. Broadbent as Gilbert, in particular, is an absolute joy to behold. The rehearsal scenes for `The Mikado' where he terrorizes his cast into fearful submission, a masterpiece of understated humour. Others are excellent too. Allan Corduner as Sullivan; Wendy Nottingham as D'Oyly Carte's assistant Helen Lenoir, Lesley Manville as Gilbert's wife; and the mighty Timothy Spall as Savoy star performer Dickie Temple showing once again that he can simply do anything.

Mike Leigh was riding high in 1996 on the massive success of `Secrets and Lies' then perhaps went through a bit of a bad patch when `Career Girls' failed to repeat this. So it's tempting to think of this, his next project as his own `Mikado'. Certainly it's a spectacular departure from his previous work. And a wholly triumphant one.",1104278400,6,2165,4.9944598337950135
1095009,3,630589423X,"""Topsy-Turvy"" is a lavishly staged period film about the famous lyricist-composer duo W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, whose Victorian musicals were bigger than Broadway shows back in their days (relative to the country's population, that is).  Their musicals were nicknamed ""topsy-turvydom"" for their seemingly confusing settings and plots.  This movie starts off with the cool reception of G&S's new musicals and spends over an hour depicting various things in G&S's lives, which unfortunately are quite boring, even to many a G&S fan.

When Gilbert (played superbly by a good actor) hits upon the idea of a musical based in Japan, the movie brings out the main part of the story: the staging of the most popular G&S musical, ""The Mikado.""  Unfortunately, the film tends to drag on and on over small things while missing the big picture (no pun intended).  For example, we see how the Savoy Theatre actors fight with management over pay; ok, so they were back then just as they are nowadays, obsessed with money.  But the film doesn't tell us that in real life, Gilbert and Sullivan never got along despite their over a dozen collaborations.  The film indulges itself in the depiction of the rehearsal of ""The Mikado,"" but never tells us what *that* story is really about, or that ""The Mikado"" is actually Gilbert's brilliant satire of the British bureaucracy of his days.

Overall, the two-and-a-half-hour film feels boring, despite having a rather interest subject.  The actor who plays Gilbert puts up some superb performance, while the others are at best mediocre and at worst unbelievable.  In the end, this is an okay movie for G&S fans, but not a movie worth watching for most people.",1104019200,,1694,4.975177304964539
1095112,4,630589423X,"While somewhat self-indulgent in its length (over two hours!), it's a complete delight in every way. Leigh's dialogue is as witty as his direction is fluid, the music is glorious, and the performances polished from almost everyone in the ensemble.
The principal reservation I have is that those of us in the audience who may not be aficionados of G&S works will leave the theater in the dark about the themes of the compositions. Just what is ""The Mikado""--a piece which lampoons British society but which distances the satire by situating the action in Japan? (P.S. The features on the DVD take care of this, so they may be worth watching prior to the movie.)
Yet, Leigh evokes a very authentic atmosphere, creates credible characterisations, and is ultimately not afraid to balance the realities behind the performances with certain matters left in the air at the end. The passion for art (whether it be Gilbert & Sullivan operettas or, you know, clay sculpture) is what burns intensely in this movie. Some may judge this film as stuffy or high-nose, but the tremendous heart of this film is almost impossible not to be carried away by.
A very unusual but satisfying treat.",1088899200,7,1175,4.850746268656716
1095113,5,630589423X,"This delightful retelling of the creation of the Gilbert and Sullivan masterpiece THE MIKADO is as improbable a product from the hands of Mike Leigh as a Hollywood shoot-'em-up would have been from Jane Campion.  Leigh had made his reputation by crafting some amazingly intimate films about human relationships in films like the astonishing SECRETS AND LIES (which features in Brenda Blethyn one of the two or three greatest performances ever by an actress in any film).  The idea of doing a historical recreation of Gilbert and Sullivan is not one that easily attaches itself to Leigh.  Nonetheless, this film is in every sense masterful and entertaining.
With a director of the ability of Mike Leigh, it is no surprise that the film is superb as a production.  Everything is superb about the film.  The art direction and set design is extraordinary, and I can't imagine a historical film more compellingly done than this one.  Moreover, the musical numbers are exquisitely done, and always convincing.
In the end, however, as superb as the direction and the design are, what drives this movie are the performers.  This is a very fine ensemble cast, many of them Mike Leigh regulars, like the very fine Timothy Sprall, who winningly plays Richard Temple.  Jim Broadbent has since the release of TOPSY-TURVY managed to establish himself as a superstar character actor through films like MOULIN ROUGE, NICHOLAS NICKLEBY, and IRIS (for which he won an Oscar).  I always marvel at his range and his ability to sell any role.  He is stellar here as the Stoic and emotionally conservative W. S. Gilbert.  I really enjoyed Shirley Henderson (who I recently saw in a great Danish/Scottish film WILBUR WANTS TO KILL HIMSELF, which I hope will get released in the United States) in her smallish role as a musical performer who is struggling with problems of addiction (like many others in the D'Oyly Carte company).  The relatively unknown (at least in the U.S.) Martin Savage stands out as George Grossmith, the person who not only starred in the Gilbert and Sullivan musicals, but was the foremost musical stage performer of the late Victorian age, sort of London's answer to Mandy Patinkin a hundred years later.  Grossmith also wrote a highly popular book with his brother Weedon, THE DIARY OF A NOBODY.  I could go on and on about other performers who stood out in small but impressive roles, such as Lesley Manville, who has a heartbreaking scene as Gilbert's unfulfilled and quietly unhappy wife.
It has to be emphasized that this is not a movie only for fans of light opera.  It really is irrelevant whether someone does or does not enjoy Gilbert and Sullivan.  This is primarily a movie about people, about show business, and about how a group of flawed and merely human beings can collaborate in producing something phenomenal.  This is not a niche film.  It is a film to be enjoyed by anyone who enjoyed movies at their best.",1069545600,68,2927,4.855130784708249

(we settled on one each of cole porter and noel coward.)
this film is also for those who have a fair bit of knowledge about late-19th century england and its mores (there's a virtual acute accent over that 'e').  the passing reference to 'chinese' gordon's death at khartoum places the film's events in the broader historic context.  the dialogue manages to suggest the formality of the times without becoming a parody.  the sets, especially the senior mrs. gilbert's bedchamber ('room' is inadequate)are marvelous, as, of course, are the costumes.  the era was wonderfully captured, along with some of its hypocrisies.
the film is also impressive in the way a short scene or a few lines of dialogue can suggest the family and social history and background of gilbert and sullivan and the various actors.  this is not a film for people who cannot hear between the lines.
the perfomances, spoken and sung, are wonderful--especially since you can contrast the performances of several of the actors in this film with their performances in 'trainspotting'--great demonstration of the concept of 'range.'.  n.b.:  when leonora is speaking of 'her' beauty, she is quoting yumyum's lines from the opera, as well as revealing, possibly, her own feelings.
others have mentioned its treatment of the creative process and the manner in which a performance evolves.  i enjoyed the superficial civility of the composer's critiques of the orchestra.  so much more suave (and lacking in vulgarity) than is likely today.

1095117,5,630589423X,"There is so much I love about this movie it is hard to try to find some coherent way to tell you why this is such a wonderful film.  There is no way to tell you everything that I delight in, what follows will have to do.
Let's start with the way it evokes late 19th century London and the wonderful culture of that time.  We are given wonderful and bright colors in the theatre and in the homes and businesses!  We are charmed by the crude telephones (which were ultra-tech in those days), the fashions, the exotic mixing of truly disparate cultures who knew little of each other, the notions of the time of what was progressive (women smoking, ""free love"", and so on), the music making in salons and in private (the piano four-hands, the recital, and the reading to each other).  What a magical evocation of a past age.
I also love the way it takes us into the making of musical theater (well, it is English - so theatre, I guess), with all the varied personalities with their often strange cares and woes.  This was a time before agents and while stars still commanded higher pay, they had to try and get it themselves.  The negotiations of the cast with D'oyly Carte are priceless, as is his masterful handling of the temperamental Sullivan, and the rigid Gilbert.  And Wendy Nottingham plays Helen Lenoir (D'Oyly Carte's associate) with a charming steeliness that is captivating.
As Gilbert and Sullivan struggle with Sullivan's requirement he write a real opera rather than another topsy-turvy musical we get to see how Gilbert comes up with the idea for ""The Mikado"".  And I love how the movie isn't linear.  It is wonderful to see various numbers in all stages of preparation.  From the earliest rehearsals, to reading lines with the stars and Gilbert correcting the pronunciation and improvisations to get them to hold to what he wrote and the way his lines scan.  We even get to see the way cast members struggle when hard rehearsed numbers are cut (and restored).
Then there are the wonderful performances of the entire cast.  Jim Broadbent and Lesley Manville have a magical chemistry as she cares for and helps a largely oblivious, yet loving Gilbert.  He really is clueless, but talented and doesn't understand what he gets away with because of his talent.  Ms Manville's performance is probably the most touching and beautiful in the film.  On the other hand, Gilbert's encounters with his separated parents is an adventure into the strange and are both humorous and a bit frightening.
Allan Corduner's portrayal of Arthur Sullivan is another treasure the film gives us.  Sullivan and his free-spirited entourage are a lot of fun, if a bit tired and dissipated.  His liaisons with a wide range of women and his touching conversations with them are touching and a bit pathetic at the same time.  However, it is wonderful to hear Victorian chamber music with all its sentimentality.  It can somehow sounds a bit cloying to our jaded ears, but the movie does such a fantastic job of evoking the time that the music can be better understood and heard in its cultural context and we can hear with somewhat fresher ears than if we had just popped a disk into our CD player.
Timothy Spall and Martin Savage give great performances as stars in the company.  They sing and perform as if they had done these operettas (the film calls them operas) all their lives.  Maybe they did before they became famous film actors, but it is uncanny how good they are in their roles.
The frailties of the stars of the D'oyly Carte Company are manifold and provide other opportunities to see 19th century Victorianism up close without condemnation or praise.  It is wonderfully done.  The crazy and casual use of injected drugs, the constants imbibing of alcohol and the ubiquitous smoking also help us breathe in the culture of that time.
This is a great treasure from that wonderful opening scene with the white gloved attendants checking each theatre seat for proper functionality and cleanliness, to Gilbert's mad walk through the back streets of London during the premier of Mikado, to Leonora's soliloquy to her own beauty and her solo, ""The Sun's Rays are All Ablaze"" and everything in between are things to always treasure.",1059955200,10,4221,4.744186046511628
1095118,4,630589423X,"The first half of ""Topsy-Turvy,"" Mike Leigh's enjoyable period piece about the London theater late in the time of good Queen Victoria, is about the famous comic operetta team of Gilbert & Sullivan not writing another show.  Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) has been knighted by her Majesty and now wants to devote his talent to composing a serious opera before he dies and wants nothing to do with the world of topsy-turvy that writer William S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) keep revisiting.  The pair have done 10 shows together and the latest, ""Princess Ida,"" has close early, forcing impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook) to get in the business of putting on revivals (""The Sorcerer"").  But while Sullivan is off in a Paris bordello, presumably being inspired to write his serious opus, Gilbert's long suffering wife, Kitty (Lesley Manville) drags him off for some diverting entertainment at a performance of a Japanese Kabuki play.  Gilbert picks up a samurai sword and eventually there comes the moment when we know from the look in his eyes that he has come up with the idea for ""The Mikado.""
The second half of ""Topsy-Turvy"" has to do with the preparation for the first performance of ""The Mikado,"" and except for a scene in which he pleasantly takes the orchestra to task for its mistakes during the first run through of a song, Sullivan disappears and Gilbert takes over.  This is rather ironic because on opening night Gilbert will not appear until the curtain call while Sullivan is done in the pit leading everyone through their paces.  The actual performances are cut into the film during the preparation stages, giving us a taste of the polished finish product while Gilbert correct, revises, and cuts the work as we go merrily along.  Besides, with all his high profile character work and Oscar win for ""Iris,"" Broadbent has become something of a star, or at least a recognizable face with a name that everyone now knows, since this film came out.  There are lots of films with nice auditions sequences (""Fame"" and ""A Chorus Line"" immediately come to mind), but few that have dealt with the rehearsal process to this extent (""All That Jazz"" and ""Stage Door"" have a couple of choice scenes).  I admit I am not familiar enough with the works of Gilbert & Sullivan to enjoy ""Topsy-Turvy"" on those grounds, but as someone who has been in their share of dramatic productions (including a musical) I loved the details of preparation depicted in the film and the fact that Gilbert actually had a heart along with that coin counting mind.  But if you do not have any theater blood in your veins, then I suspect this 2000 film will be a tad too tedious for you.",1055030400,,2667,4.753246753246753

Set in mid-1880s London, the film is essentially the story of the conception and production of the comic opera ""Mikado"" by Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) and William Gilbert (Jim Broadbent). Sullivan, the composer, is an irrepressible bon vivant and the complete opposite of lyricist Gilbert, a serious businessman. The two ruled the city's stage scene for years, and T-T is a tribute to their remarkable partnership.
Unfortunately, I've never been a particular fan of Gilbert and Sullivan, and T-T is 160 interminable minutes of dialogue that was, for me, neither dramatic or comic, and the ""action"" proceeded at a glacial pace. The costuming and make-up deserved the Oscars they won, and Broadbent and Corduner do solid work, but how far can you go on those merits?
TOPSY-TURVY will engage those students of the live stage who are fascinated with the nuts and bolts of putting a production together. But I may as well have been watching two engineers collaborate on the design and construction of an assembly line for making wire hangers. Even the 15 minutes or so dedicated to showing ""Mikado"" as it finally appeared at the Savoy Theatre left me cold. ""Mikado"" is no ""Cats"", which I saw at least four times, or ""Evita"", which I saw thrice.
As I recall, T-T played locally only in the art houses, and even then not for very long. It apparently didn't appeal to the sweaty movie-going masses, of which, for once, I admit being a proud member.",1049587200,5,1700,4.885813148788928

A superb masterpiece of vignettes and touching insights into the lives of two of the most gifted collaborators of the Victorian Age.

Topsy-Turvy catches Gilbert and Sullivan in the midst of their successful careers. Having already scored numerous hits(The Pirates of Penzance, Sorcerer, and HMS Pinafore to name a few), they've reached a creative dry spot with their latest work, entitled Princess Ida. Sullivan (Allan Corduner), the composer, is tired of not being taken seriously and vows to write a ""serious"" piece of music as his next effort, much to the dismay of his partner Gilbert (Jim Broadbent), who is happy with their whimsical, ""topsy-turvy"" scenarios. Sullivan finds his fulfilling his goal extremely difficult until, due to his wife's insistence, Gilbert attends a Japanese exposition in London, where inspiration quickly strikes and ""The Mikado"" is slowly (exruciatingly slow) born. Soon, we are being taken behind the creative process of the opera, from the writing of ""The Mikado"" and eventually to its opening night. Never having heard a Gilbert and Sullivan piece, I was quite fascinated by the musical numbers and enjoyed them a great deal. They are executed quite nicely and performed with great energy by the entire incredible cast. And it is the fantastic cast and these musical numbers that make the film so bearable. The costumes, the sets, the performances, and Mike Leigh's brilliant direction are all on target and greatly benefit the film. Unfortunately, there is not enough plot, and not much going on, to save the film from being an absolute bore. And at almost three hours, it is an almost unbearable bore. I would find my mind drifting off until another wonderful musical number began. Unfortunately, they are too few and too far in-between. Perhaps a film version of ""The Mikado"" would have been more appropriate because there simply is not enough story here to sustain the entire film and keep its audience attention. Had the film been 40 minutes shorter, and that's a lot, it could have greatly benefited the film. Overall, the film had too much going for it to be absolutely terrible, if only it was more interesting. How I wish it was!!!

I am one of them, so first I'll say that I found the performance of the G&S material in this movie absolutely superb.  I've never seen a Mikado as genuinely funning and eccentric as Tim Sprall's, or a Yum-Yum as winsomely self-centered as Shirley Hendersen's Leonora Branham.
Viewers who find musicals simplistic or shallow or generally silly  should make an exception in the case of Topsy-Turvy.  It is none of those things.  In true Mike Leigh fashion, the actors inhabit their characters like second skin.  No one is simple or shallow. Nor does Leigh avoid the seamier side of London theatrical life. I particularly liked Jim Broadbent's bitterly comic and misanthropic Gilbert, Martin Savage as the opium-addicted George Grossmith (the 'patter baritone' who rips through Gilbert's rapidfire lyrics like a rap song), and Lucy Manville as Gilbert's long-suffering wife.

Here we have an English treat from Mike Leigh called Topsy-Turvy. I thought it was lots of fun, but in reading this review, you can decide if it might cheer you up or drive you to distraction.
In late 19th Century England, Gilbert and Sullivan were at the top of the heap in the musical theater. They reinvented it, like Jerome Kern did in the 1920s, Rogers and Hammerstein in the 1950s and Bob Fosse in the 1970s. Tastes change, and what they wrote over one hundred years ago doesn't sound pop to our ears. It sounds classical. The truth is that they were theatrical entrepreneurs as well, much like Andrew Lloyd Webber is today. Topsy-Turvy is a look at a very interesting slice of their successful but tumultuous lives.
As the movie opens, they are middle-aged. Arthur Sullivan [Allan Corduner] is at home recovering from an illness which we suspect was caused by his raucous lifestyle. He is witty, debonair and lusty. He has a pretty mistress and travels often to Paris to enjoy its delights. William Gilbert [Jim Broadbent] is just the opposite. Though ultimately lovable, he is moody, bossy, obsessive and often grumpy. Together with impresario Richard D'Orly-Carte, they put on their musicals at the lavish Savoy Theater, which they own. Their newest work is a critical failure. The public is staying away in droves, and closing is imminent. A new musical must be written at once. They are obligated to do so, but Sullivan, having worked with sour-pussed Gilbert for nearly two decades, it ready to quit and go one to something else. They have a great fight and quit speaking to each other. It seems to be all finished, but their greatest work is yet to come.
The movie is the best British period piece in some time. The sets, the costumes and the music, which is glorious, seem quite authentic. The performances are excellent. Perhaps best of all, we get a detailed look at how the theater worked then and how it probably still works. We see the accounting, the costume making, the staging, the rehearsals, the casting and more. There are detailed looks at the cast members - who they are, how they work, and even what their habits are. It's all done in a way that is far more comedic than dramatic. These people go through torture, but they are, one and all, fast-talking, quick witty troupers.
If the movie has a drawback, it is its length. At two hours and forty minutes, it seems lie it could have used a twenty to thirty minutes trim. Still, director Mike Leigh, previously know for modern working-class dramas, felt he had to show it all, and I, for one, would not know where to begin cutting Topsy-Turvy. Perhaps the running time is justified.",1016409600,5,2798,4.665991902834008
1095234,2,630589423X,"Topsy-Turvy (to the extent that it's ""about"" anything) is about Gilbert and Sullivan and the making of The Mikado (definitely one of their best works.) I love Gilbert and Sullivan's work, and I knew that the story of their relationship was very interesting. The previews also looked very interesting, so I was quite anxious to see this film. The actual film was hugely disappointing to me, however.
I am a firm believer in the importance of plot in filmmaking.  If you do not believe plot is important, or do not demand a fast pace in the absence of plot, you may quite enjoy the meandering nature of this visually appealing slice of Victorian life.  For me, though, the film never quite clicked on any level.
I could definitely see the things that others liked about the film: The casting was good, the acting was excellent, the cinematography was beautiful, and the film definitely reproduced the feel of its era effectively. It featured excellent renditions of several bits of The Mikado (though these performances were overly static in order to preserve the Victorian feel.)
What the film didn't do, though, was entertain, tell a really interesting story, or even educate effectively. It had all the elements of a great Victorian drama without much actual drama, and the elements of a refined Victorian comedy with very little actual humor.
There were far too many little subplots (drug-addicted singers, and the like) whose sole purpose seemed to be either to give bit players the opportunity to show they could act or to impart minor bits of historical information. The problem was, there was no follow-up on any of these scenes. Something seemingly momentous would happenm but there would be no effect on anything else anywhere in the movie. I realize that the filmmakers were trying for historical accuracy, but this is supposed to be a movie, not a documentary. (If it were a documentary, of course, they could just tell you what happened in such cases).
The film covers a relatively short period in the lives of Gilbert and Sullivan, and as a result we never get to see the real blow-ups between them (the arguments we see seem on the order of minor spats). We don't get to follow the development of their careers, the course of their relationship, or anything of the sort. We simply see how The Mikado got them out of a temporary creative rut, interspersed with random bits about the people in their lives. A number of scenes clearly had the feel of improvisations constructed on the spot to illustrate one fact or another, regardless of whether the fact really deserved the five minutes of screen time such an improvisation would take.
Also notably missing from the film was humor, which is particularly annoying since the film focused primarily on one of the foremost humorists in a time when people went to great effort to speak wittily. There were mildly humorous bits interspersed throughout, but not with sufficient frequency that this film could in any way be considered a comedy.
Perhaps tighter editing would at least have prevented the film from wandering quite so aimlessly. Perhaps a higher proportion of performance clips would have made the whole more lively.

Another important thing: You DON'T HAVE to be a G&S fan to enjoy this movie. The music, although prevalent, takes second place behind the story-telling.

This movie is a showcase in subtle storytelling and directing..little by little the director pulls you in to the world of G&S so much so that even non-fans could follow the story and appreciate it. And of course, long time G&S fans will be tickled pink to get a bit of an inside view into the minds and lives of the men who gave us the musicals we love so well.
What can I say?..The acting is superb,  the storytelling is wonderfully sublime..and this movie is absolutely hilarious at time( namesly, the corsett controversy).  I mean...were it not for the laws of time and space..at times I almost could believe I was watching more a documentary than a movie, the performances were so real.  And of course...the icing on top is the music. If you are a true G&S fan, you will find yourself humming along to alot of the tunes, and the reherasal and performance scenes will tease you, esp if like me, u haven't had the good fortune to ever see a play of thiers performed live.  All in all, this movie is a gem, and ranks high on my list of the best period piece movies of all time. Good work Mr. Leigh-A.N.

""Topsy Turvy"" is an excellently put together piece, but the problem is that it is dreadfully long, so much so that I suspect it was actually a miniseries that they decided to release at a single sitting. The first half of the film depicts the two very different men who comprised the team of Gilbert and Sullivan. We see the rather trashy bon vivant lifestyle of Sullivan, living it up in a house of ill repute at one point, and this is contrasted to the stodgy household of Gilbert, who seems vaguely repressed in his marriage and has one old ""w""itch of a mother. Now, there I was in the movie theatre on New Year's Day with some friends watching all this and I was doing alright for well over an hour, when suddenly I was seized with terror as the thought popped into my head: ""Hey, isn't this movie supposed to be about the staging of 'The Mikado'? They're not even REMOTELY near that yet!"" And so I knew that I was in for The Long Haul, a movie that seemed to last for five hours. And of course, they did a wonderful job of that whole sequence too, when they finally got round to it.
So, the thing to keep in mind with ""Topsy Turvy"" is this length. If you rent it, consider it a two-parter, and stop in the middle to sleep or whatever, and then come back to it the next day. Also, I think you really would have to have some appreciation for the oeuvre of Gilbert and Sullivan beforehand. Two of my friends were so into it that the film just breezed by for them, while a third woman just conked out and slept through a large part of it. ""The Mikado"" is one of G&S's best scores, and the singers turn in A+ performances as the original Mikado cast members--you get as caught up in their lives as with G&S's. Wonderful costuming and the traditional British eccentric acting help put the film over beautifully, provided that you've got enough grit to make it through to the credits. Rent well advised, and you'll do fine.",1002758400,2,2066,4.368831168831169

But there are so many excellent scenes, especially during the 'rehearsals' portion of the film.  And I like how the little obstacles that presented themselves in the staging of The Mikado did not pay off in an obvious fashion.  When the light opera is performed with great aplomb and without a hitch, it is obvious that the actress with the bad leg and the actor with the morphine habit and the other actress with her bouts of depression are simply pros and that's that.

To single out any one performance as exceptional would be doing a disservice to the other 20 characters you'll meet in this film. It almost seems as if the historical persons themselves had taken the roles, because the portrayals are so seamless, so effortless and natural. The songs are excellent, and will have you humming them for days afterwards. My children put this film on the machine themselves to hear the musical portions again and again. Rated R for a brief, comical French brothel scene, the film is otherwise completely suitable for a family to watch, although the character development is comprehensive and might puzzle and/or make younger viewers fidgety in its length.

1095328,4,630589423X,"I have never liked Mike Leigh. His films are usually constructed by some months of his actors adlibbing dialogue to construct a script. The end result is something that I find artificial and his portrayal of working class people is often patronizing.
It was thus a shock that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is quite long over two hours but despite that the time flew despite almost nothing happening. I might also add that I have almost no knowledge of Gilbert and Sullivan.
The movie covers the making of one of their productions the Mikardo. Sullivan the writer of the music has been concerned for sometime about his career and pines to write ""serious music"". After one of their productions fails Gilbert is asked to come up with another libretto. He does but Sullivan refuses to write any music as he sees the story as hackneyed. By chance Gilbert visits a Japanese exposition in London and starts to write a libretto set in Japan in such a way that the stage production can incorporate the costumes of what would have seemed at the time an exotic country.
The film then shows how a musical is constructed. The rehearsals, the decisions about costume design, what numbers to put in how directors work.
The problem that I have had with Mike Leigh's films is that actors are often not good people to write dialogue about normal events as it is outside their experience. In this case the film is about theatre and the dialogue is brilliant in showing the petty squabbles the interaction of the characters and so on.
All of the actors are brilliant and the film is shot almost entirely (except for a brief 30 second shot) in the studio. The costumes and the sets brilliantly evoke the period and the film is fascinating. For Gilbert and Sullivan fans the presentation of the music is fragmented so that they would probably not enjoy it.

The ensemble cast is extraordinary, the musical performances outstanding, and the glimpse of a little discussed era in musical history provocative and, boy, is it entertaining! It is one of the few films I've seen where I actually thought about viewing it a second time directly after the first because I enjoyed it so much.
I had meant to see it in the theater - everyone I knew who had seen it loved it - but time got away from me and before I knew it, this film wasn't running in theaters anymore.  Seeing it for the first time on DVD is the next best thing.
Mike Leigh's direction, as always, is seamless.  You lose sight of the fact that these are actors up there on screen, so convincingly are each of the characters portrayed.  Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent as Gilbert and Sullivan steal the show but the supporting cast does terrific work as well, especially Timothy Spall as an older singer whose career is coming to an end and Shirley Henderson as a young soprano and a single mother with a little boy at home to feed.  The film's final moment belongs to her and it's a spinetingling one at that.
While there is much here that is humorous - and vividly colorful - Mike Leigh gives us glimpses of the squalor that was rampant in London at the tail end of the Industrial Revolution.  Scenes of opulence are contrasted sharply with gray, sooty back alleys where prostitutes lurk.  An atmosphere of death and sickness pervade throughout.

Mike Leigh and his troupe in Topsy Turvy have recreated Victorian London with a richness and a vibrant credibility that can only be found in the works of Conan Doyle and Dickens. With hardly a single exterior shot.
From the moment we meet Sir Arthur Sullivan, who has overslept for a 7:30pm opening curtain and needs reviving with plenty of hot coffee and a shot of cocaine to get to the theatre on time; to the final meclancholy scenes as the major characters leave the stage, we are treated to wonderful costumes, great sets, sparkling music and above all to great actors, at the top of their form, luxuriating in material which they have helped to create.
The piece demonstrates perfectly that accurately recreating character, mood and tone are far more important than props and scenery when recreating the past. Though there are plenty of props too.
And the 160 minutes of music aren't decoration. We rarely see a whole number - they are cut to perfection - timed to chime exquisitely with the action.

After having watched TOPSY-TURVY, I couldn't wait to buy the DVD for myself--not because I wanted to see the whole movie again, but because I wanted to see parts of it again and again.  This is the quintessential movie to have in your own collection.  The scenes of performances from Gilbert and Sullivan operettas are better than I ever hope to see on stage, because they have been assembled and produced with meticulous attention to detail, transforming us right into the audiences in London at the turn of the century where people read Gilbert's libretto even as they watch the show on opening night.  I was in fact surprised to see this authentic touch, for Gilbert's librettos, and the D'Oly Carte Opera Company, are noted for their precision of diction.  If the words are that clearly sung, why follow the words on paper?  The reason is Respect.  There was enormous respect for Gilbert's phenomenal lyrical abilities.  And imagine, those opening night audiences could even see and hear Sir Arthur Sullivan conducting the orchestra. If there ever was a ""blast from the past,"" this movie is it!
The finest scenes in the movie--each worth the price of admission, as they say--are those actual scenes from the operettas.  But the most mind-blowing scene of all is the extended scene of the rehearsal for ""The Mikado,"" where we find Gilbert as director trying to get the right ""look"" for the show out of his actors.  The actors resist him a bit (after all, all actors do), and we see that there must have been an enormous amount of trust in Gilbert to do it his way.  What he wanted was, above all, authenticity--no overacting.  Too many real-live performances of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas have I seen where overacting and mugging take over the show.  The specific ""English"" humor of the G & S team is a straight-faced kind of humor, far more funny because the actors take the script seriously!  The hilarity of the G & S vision is easily subverted if the actors think that their job on stage is to be individually funny.  No, the show is an ensemble thing.  It works as a group. And in the movie, we see the actors, individually, but also as members of a group of thespians.  It is startling and a bit of wonderful to see these same people get up on stage and do their thing.  And they do do it--really.  All the actors in this movie are also stage performers.  (You can get a clue about this because, for once, they are not all handsome and beautiful; if they were, then we'd know their voices were dubbed!)  We share the suspense as we watch these actors, whom we have briefly come to know in the film, get up on stage and blow us away with the most magnificent scenes from ""The Mikado"" we'd ever hope to see!
Why then, only four stars?  The film wastes too much time going into the relationship between Gilbert and Sullivan, and far too much time on Sullivan's declaration of independence--when he wants to write songs on his own, or write operas on his own.  These were all failed attempts, so why resurrect them now?  How much better this movie would have been if they had cut some of that extensive dialogue and cut ""The Lost Chord"" (a Sullivan ""popular"" song of its day), and instead given us a staged scene--or even two!--from ""Pinafore"" or ""Patience."" (I really missed ""Pinafore""--I wonder what these actors in this film could have done with it.)  I think the reason the producers and director took so much time with the book scenes was that they didn't want to waste all the research they had done into the lives of Gilbert and Sullivan.  Somehow they failed to see that we don't want to be bogged down with their lives; we want to know something about them, to be sure, but in the same way we want to know something about the performers--we like to see how it all comes together on stage!
Bottom line:  a DVD you must have in your collection; its value will grow over the years.  A solid four-star film.",969753600,4,3923,4.551282051282051
1095485,5,630589423X,"I live in fear of Period Films, but this was written and directed by Mike  Leigh, with a thoroughbred script and such infectious passion that even at  two and a half hours, it seems way too short. I loved its authenticity - I  mean, how many movies would strive to make everything from eye makeup to  the light itself properly 1880's - and its spirit is modern and grown up.  It's real life, not costume drama. And everyone in it does look like who  they're playing! especially Jim Broadbent (a brilliant and quintessential  W.S. Gilbert), and Martin Savage (George Grossmith), whose resemblances are  quite scary.
The score is Sullivan's own music, used to excellent effect.  My favourite instance is when two of the Savoy leads, over lunch, poke  bitterly sarcastic fun at the Empire by ""berating"" the  ungrateful, barely human Hottentots, who haven't played fair with the  redcoats at Khartoum. The scene's accompaniment (""The Soldiers of our  Queen"" from Patience) is G&S' - albeit gentler -dig at the same  sort of thing.
The entire cast is flawless; acting of this calibre, in  such abundance, must be very good for the soul! If I had to single anyone  out, it would be Martin Savage, who is every inch the fiendishly talented,  quicksilver charmer G.G. must have been. He's the impeccable comedian  onstage and off most of the time, but when his chronic first-night nerves  become too much (and he has to inject morphine to calm them) it touchingly  mirrors the film's quiet skill at sometimes turning its wit into a mask.  It's very rare for film characters to be so lovable, and to worry for them  so much, considering none of them do anything more heroic than get on with  the show...
Of course Topsy-Turvy isn't entirely perfect - it's far too  intelligent and visceral for that. But I defy anyone to resist a film that  drags Gilbert and Sullivan and the whole Victorian age out of mummification  and makes them sexy again.

Mike Leigh's direction brings out the best in the actors and the staging,  transporting the viewer back into Victorian England as W.S. Gilbert and  Arthur Sullivan struggle with the task of providing Richard D'Oyly Carte's  Savoy Theatre with yet another successful operetta.
An interesting  sidelight to the film is that all the actors are actually singing or  playing the instruments portrayed in the movie.  Although some rate this  movie as a little long, I found that the time passed quickly on both  viewing occasions.  The only scene I found a little out of place was the  French bordello scene with Sullivan, which didn't fit with the overall  tenor of the film.

Once the impasse between Gilbert and Sullivan is broken by the creation of  ""The Mikado"", the film takes off. The rehearsal scenes are  delightful; humorous and well performed. The actual performance scenes are  equally so. The music is infectious.  This film gets better each time I  watch it.

1095612,5,630589423X,"First of all, let's get this straight. I love musical comedy, especially those with gorgeous staging, period costumes, unforgetable melodies and witty and clever lyrics. That's why I treasure Gilbert and Sullivan and  love this film.
  It's a wowser. Perfectly cast, wonderfully written,  neither treacley sweet nor boringly virtual as to the persona, quirks, and  strangely complimentary genii of two Victorian toffs who collectively  produced some of the most joyously clever and irreverent musical comedies  in history. They invented the double entendre, patter music and topsy-turvy  plots in a smug hypocritically moralistic era when both churches and  brothels thrived. The public loved it then and you will too.
  The  movie itself is about the production of G&S's greatest hit, The Mikado.  It provides a wonderful insight into how such a production was developed,  produced, rehearsed and put-on in the 19th century and how it still  enchants and beguiles in the 21st.
  There is one little naughty scene  in a Paris whore-house that lasts for about 90 seconds, but I'm sure the  kiddies (over 13) have seen worse on PBS or the Internet. Just tell them  it's Offenbach at it's best. It might keep the older ones interested.
  Get it. Watch it. Watch it again. Enjoy.",964742400,2,1275,5.117073170731707
1095613,5,630589423X,"One of the best films of 1999. Meticulously crafted, gloriously comic and quite possibly the greatest musical biopic of the past decades. Expertly directed by Mike Leigh he brilliantly captures the times and characters  creating a mood of comic eccentricity that elevated it way above normal  Hollywood fare. An unforgettable comic depiction of the creative process as  we see the travails of Gilbert & Sullivan in making one of their most  famous collaborations; 'The Mikado'. From the springing of the idea (in a  priceless scene) to wardrobe and rehearsals leading to the ultimate  presentation in a wonderfully touching ending. Allan Corduner delivers a  towering performance as Sullivan and Jim Broadbent is almost as good as  Gilbert. Inspired casting and acting all around and Timothy Spall (a Leigh  regular) stands out as a veteran actor. Great makeup and gorgeous set  design and costumes. Great musical numbers and inspired bits of comedy  abound. A wonderful film that has a lot to offer. From a scale of 1-10 I  give this film a 9!",964396800,6,1044,5.04093567251462
1095614,5,630589423X,"I've been a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan for quite some time, and from the point of view of someone who has just about every recording of their operas made since the 1920s, this movie is, to quote their 1893 opera Utopia  Limited, ""a wonderful joy our eyes to bless.""
The performances  are very good, especially Jim Broadbent's masterful portrayal of W. S.  Gilbert. Broadbent doesn't just play Gilbert, he *becomes* Gilbert, with  all the mannerisms and quirks (to say the least!) involved in such a  complex personality.
The music is, of course, fantastic. How could anyone  not like it? :)  It's sprinkled throughout the movie, a common thread  binding the film together.
All of this goes into a fascinating and  accurate portrayal of the events leading up to The Mikado. The arguments,  the Lozenge Plot (""in this instance, it is a magic potion""), the  last minute changes, Gilbert's inspiration, it's all covered in marvelous  detail that never becomes boring. The film takes great care to be  historically accurate, down to duplicating the sets and costumes used in  the early D'Oyly Carte productions. The movie shows Victorian London in all  its glory and all its flaws. If you want realism, this is it.
If you like  Gilbert and Sullivan, this movie is a must! And even if not, it's still a  great movie!",963705600,7,1311,4.807174887892376

Even the performances in the film were  uninteresting.  I thought I was a fan of Gilbert & Sullivan, but I  guess I'm not!",963705600,12,299,4.175438596491228
1095616,5,630589423X,"I've only one major complaint about Mike Leigh's 'Topsy Turvy'. At a bit under three hours in length, it's too short -- we don't want it to end! This is one of the best musical biographies extant -- its leisurely  development lets you see into the life of the early performers of the Savoy  Operas, and in the end, the film is as much about them as it is about  Gilbert or Sullivan. We care for these characters, for their ambitions, for  their insecurities and weaknesses. Under the perfect frivolity of the music  lies frailty and anguish, and that's the strength of this film.  The only  weak link in the casting is in the role of George Grossmith, who lacks what  must have been that character's extraordinary charisma, wit and charm.  Grossmith's modern successors, notably John Reed and Dennis Olsen, are  actor/singers who could claim the entire stage -- a stronger actor in this  role would have claimed the entire film. But that's a minor quibble about a  film so true to its subjects, so imbued with love for its characters.",963273600,3,1034,4.651933701657459
1095617,5,630589423X,"I watched this DVD with several other Gilbert and Sullivan enthusiasts and the unanimous verdict was very, VERY good - if a bit heavy going at times. The attention to historical detail and the rather dull conversations mean  that one has to pay attention ALL the time, unlike action movies such as  the Die Hard series where you just check your brain in at the door and sit  back and enjoy!
The movie takes us back in time to Victorian England of  the 1880s and details the problems between Gilbert and Sullivan and the way  in which they were eventually led to compose The Mikado. What I found  fascinating was the way Victorian England came so vividly to life. It was  like stepping back in time. Some refer to that period as ""The good old  Days"" but watching Gilbert have a tooth extracted without any  anaesthetic made me glad I live in today's world!
The performances by  Alan Corduner (Sullivan) and Jim Broadbent (Gilbert) were superb - as were  the other performers. The scenes that were shown from The Mikado and some  of their other operas were brilliant. The costumes and scenary were  outstanding - unlike those in the three G & S operas from the Stratford  Festival in Ontario which are also available from Amazon. Give those a miss  and get this one if you want to see what Gilbert and Sullivan should really  be like.
One small point where I was a bit disappointed was that the  picture quality lacked sharpness. I had just shown excerpts from the James  Bond movie, The World Is Not Enough and Mozart's Requiem to my visitors,  and when Topsy Turvy started the difference was unfortunately very  noticeable.
If you like Gilbert and Sullivan, then this movie is well  worth owning, but if you're not a G & S enthusiast it might be best to  just go and rent it.",963187200,2,1775,4.533123028391167

A film that just shines - full of humor, irony, wit, and glorious music.  Corduner was marvelous as the  ecentric Sullivan but in my book, Jim Broadbent stole the show in the more  subtle presentation of the complex Gilbert.  He deserved the Oscar.  But  just as amazing, I've never seen any film in which ALL the supporting  players were so perfect, so strong. Bravo to the casting director - not one  slip.  I've seen TT in the theatre, saw it on a video screener, and DVD -  DVD is the way to go.  Some of the dialogue was lost on screen and VCR -  but on DVD - every word was clear.  This is a great film - I just wish  young people would try it to discover the great Gilbert and Sullivan.",963187200,3,803,4.0576923076923075
1095619,5,630589423X,"Topsy Turvy is a marvellous film that is like no other period piece ever made.  Elegant, funny and full of GREAT music, Mike Leigh's superb film focuses on the relationship between Gilbert & Sullivan, thier parting  of ways over creative differences and thier eventual re-teaming to create  The Mikado, thier most beloved work.  Leigh and his brilliant company of  actors examine every facet of producing a stage show in what has to be the  most detailed ""backstage"" drama ever made.  But the film is more  than just about The Mikado, its about the creative process, the joys and  hard work involved in such endeavors, and it's also a look at a time when  the British Empire ""peaked"" and the sun finally began to set on  it.  This is a real treat from Mike Leigh who normally makes films about  contemporary Britain.  Yet, in a way, its of a piece with his other works.  See this lovely film!",962841600,2,892,4.592356687898089
1095620,5,630589423X,"Topsy-Turvy is a foreign film in a foreign language: English.  This movie is not about pretty costumes nor is it an in-depth biography.  It is no less than a three-hour homage to WORDS.  Whether spoken or sung, every  utterance in this movie is a beautiful conglomeration of wordage.  An  illustration of the way words are said, breathed, sighed, screamed and  abused IS the point of this extremely well-crafted film.  This movie will  inspire you to either write a letter or lower the bass on your stereo and  actually LISTEN to the lyrics. The musical numbers are well recorded and do  justice to their purpose as a showcase of the heights at which lanuage can  reach--if even for mostly comic effect(try rhyming your next knock-knock  joke!) Also, the diretor shows a great eye for editing during the staged  scenes.  With a respect for the form he is presenting, most of the shots  are wide, relatively static and paced to the right beat.  And the close-ups  are few but helpful. For those that do not find the backstage interesting,  just turn on the sub-titles and revel in HOW, not why, they speak.

7898234,5,630589423X,"One of my all time favorite films but perhaps not for all.  The humor in this film is all character driven.  Every different character is carefully developed with strengths, weaknesses, and quirks.  The opera performers reflect the often pompous, sometimes arrogant, always insecure traits common to people who choose to perform for a living.  The owners of the opera house show the tight-rope like balance that must be walked while trying to manage a profit making business dealing with creative egos.  The period setting has some delightful touches showing the novelty of the newly developed telephone,fountain pens, and hotels with individual bathrooms.  Music lovers will enjoy seeing realistically performed Gilbert and Sullivan songs including some from their less well know shows. But best of all is the perfect comic performances of Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent as Gilbert and Sullivan themselves.  Sullivan feeling that he is not achieving his musical abilities by creating the repetitive ""Topsy-Turvy""  plots of Gilbert  wants to move on his own way. Gilbert himself feeling overburdened by his crazy family, critics who no longer appreciate his works, and a partners that threaten to kill the goose that laid the golden eggs.  Jim Broadbent, who is a national  treasure of British films, gives a performance of a lifetime . The film is probably the best ever demonstrating the theatrical process.

The creation of their masterpiece ""The Mikado"" is the centerpiece of the film.  It is interesting and a little sad to hear that many acting troupes are now dropping the Mikado from their repertoires because it is racially offensive.  But if you watch this film you will see that the actual creators  of this work admired the Japanese culture that the British public was first being exposed to at the time.  They insisted on being accurate in their costuming and to limit mimicking of stereotypical behaviors.  In fact most of the humor  is much more satirical to British sensibilities than to Japanese culture.  I think the only basis for offence is having non Japanese performers portraying Japanese  parts.  But those same acting troupes also play parts like tyrolean peasants, gypsies, and pirates .  Are those nationalities also offended?  If there are readers who find the Mikado offensive I would be very interested to know what  those offences are because it would be sad to lose such a delightful work of art without understanding why.",1442793600,11,2456,5.128463476070529
