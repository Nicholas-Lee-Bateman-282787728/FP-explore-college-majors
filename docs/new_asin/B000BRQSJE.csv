I was more than I could grip.",1373587200,,95,3.75
8091578,4,B000BRQSJE,"This is a good DVD to start with. This DVD has the easier well known line dances. But remember make the dances your own, learn to add to the dances.",1365465600,,148,3.966666666666667
8091579,5,B000BRQSJE,"I was not very familiar with line dancing before trying this tape, but with Shawn's easy to follow steps, I was able to pick up the dances pretty easily. The DVD gives you 2 views on the screen, one being the full body, and the other being just the feet, which allows you to be able to pick up the foot movements more easily.
It was also very helpful how he does the whole dance with the music first, before breaking it down into the parts. This allowed me to see what parts I could pick up by just watching, and then also what parts I would need to spend more time concentrating on. It also allows you to get a general feel for most of the steps before getting into the technical breakdown of each one.
The dances he teaches are also very fun and have gotten me excited to go out and try my foot on the dance floor.",1183248000,7,816,4.074534161490683
8091580,5,B000BRQSJE,"These dances are indeed complicated.  But as he does in other DVD's, Shawn presents the steps in segments that can be easily learned, and he encourages you to repeat them over and over to make sure you've mastered them.",1165017600,7,219,4.615384615384615
8091581,5,B000BRQSJE,"I have seen the Hip Hop Line Dance out in the clubs, and I attempted to learn it there. I finally broke down and purchased Shawn Trautman's Smokin' Line Dances, so I could learn the dance at home. Shawn does an excellent job with the Hip Hop Line Dance, and with all the other dances on the video. Shawn explains things so thoroughly that it makes them seem easy-which helps boost your confidence as you learn.",1164326400,10,410,4.407894736842105
8091582,4,B000BRQSJE,"Newbies steer clear!  These dances may be complicated enough to make you look like a pro on the dance floor, but they require some practice to master.  Fortunately, these dances are fun, so practicing isn't a chore.  I appreciate that Shawn likes to provide alternative steps where appropriate, so I can be creative and still be in time to the rhythm.  Newbies, take a look at Shawn's Party Line Dances.",1164153600,9,403,4.714285714285714
