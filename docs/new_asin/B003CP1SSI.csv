8394362,5,B003CP1SSI,"This is an interesting documentary conducted by Afghan journalist Najibullah Quaraishi in northern Afghanistan.  He was invited to film a group of Taliban and another warrior group that wanted to disrupt a main highway, which was frequently used by Americans to transport war supplies and personnel.  The overriding desire of the group was to rid Afghanistan of western influences.

The group did not have much to work with.  They were cobbling together left-over rockets and munitions from the Russian invasion, which was over 30 years ago. There was also a lot of miscommunication and disputes within the group. The planned attack proved unsuccessful.

Although Quaraishi was supposed to stay-on for 2 full weeks some new insurgents from Pakistan branded him a spy and recommended he be beheaded.  Quaraishi was able to safely exit the area though. On the way out of the country some local police officials met up with him and declared the area 'safe' (for the most part).  These same policemen were later killed when there barracks was attacked by militiamen.

I think the video is well worth watching even though it was filmed in 2009.  It provides a glimpse into the society that exists inside Afghanistan and shows how it would be difficult (impossible?) for a Western country to ever win-over their support.",1376265600,,1314,5.046296296296297
8394363,5,B003CP1SSI,"The photographer for this video lived among the Taliban for almost two weeks, recording his conversations with them as well as their actions. They repeatedly spoke of driving out the 'non-believers,' their preserving their values. The Taliban group involved lived in a remarkably open section of Afghanistan and received taxes from the villagers that should have gone to the government. Their leader was a millionaire former car dealer. There weapons were drawn from former anti-Russia caches. The video also showed them preparing two roadside bombs prior to a raid - fortunately the bombs looked rather small in ineffectual, and later failed to detonated by their intended remote controls.

A cell phone video was shown that they had made of a former attack; cell phone communications were used to connect with their spotters and leaders. The attack location was under fog and offered cover within a cotton field. Upon return to their 'base,' they gave an optimistic false report to the commander, claiming success. The group moved from one guest house to another within their territory, adjudicating disputes as presented. Eventually the photographer is driven out, due to fears that their bad luck is due to him being a spy. At the end he shows the outcome of one of their subsequent attacks - overpowering a local police station and killing all eight inside.

A second mini-video ('Pakistan's Failing Schools,' covers education in that neighboring nation. About 20,000 schools have no buildings, 60% lack electricity, and 20% are without drinking water. Pakistan has the world's highest dropout rate (less than half its school-age children are in schools), as well as 'ghost schools where teachers don't show up, continue to collect pay, and the buildings are abandoned. Construction corruption is rampant. Meanwhile madrasah schools offer new buildings, hot meals, and are free. All schools teach that the West exploits Islamists, and support extremists. American education aid is disliked by many, they allege it subverts their values due to its secular nature.",1363996800,,2067,5.279635258358662

8394365,5,B003CP1SSI,"Watched the  video origianlly on PBS and had to order the video.  As a military instructor, there are several occasions for showing this film...primarily to indicate that there is no shortage of opposing forces in the fight against terrorism, but also important to show that the opposing forces lack a critical component to US victory...team work!  The video shows classic dysfunctional guerilla warfare. This video in addition to first hand experience/accounts will give an excellent presentation.",1322352000,4,498,5.526315789473684
