8033342,5,B0002VKZLQ,"Sister Princess, in all honesty, is all kinds of fetishes rolled into one show. It's a typical harem anime where a clueless male protagonist is suddenly thrown in a world of pretty, naive girls who are all over him (which in this case are also his sisters). Unlike most others, though, this one is not sexual at all.

Art is ok, if not somewhat meh-ish. Drawing is very pokemon-era, so don't expect Miyazaki level of animation. Opening song by Yui Horie is great, but that's about it for the music. There is no coherent storyline (the show doesn't really need one). There are so many things unexplained, and so many contradictory details. Nobody explained how he got all his previously-unknown sisters. So much overreaction. And I still like it. Be sure to throw all logic out the window once you start watching this and just enjoy the cuteness. All of us can use some cute in our lives, right?

P.S. the mobile-internet-enabled netbook amused me. This was released in 2001.",1357171200,,974,4.723529411764706

8033344,5,B0002VKZLQ,"Everyone else that wrote a negative reveiw sucks. This anime is sweet and full of good lessons. It's definatly more girl-oriented, but if you're looking for something to get you into anime this is it. I highly recommened it.",1234224000,,224,4.769230769230769
8033345,1,B0002VKZLQ,"I have to say I agree with the reviewer who also rated this one star. I wanted to rate it lower but I couldnt. I can't believe I actually watched the whole first disc I thought it would get better but it just didnt, I hate writing bad reviews but I must warn everybody! Its about 12 whiny sisters bothering a whimpy whiny guy, thats all it was about. Thats all I have to say.",1157414400,,375,4.013333333333334
8033346,1,B0002VKZLQ,"I've never seen a more mind-numbing series in the history of anime as this.  I can't believe the early reviewers even saw it, when they give it a max rating.  Perhaps they all live in gingerbread houses or something.  To begin with, although as pointed out, there is nothing overtly sexual about this, the premise is just plain stupid.  Having twelve sisters who worship an impossibly nice brother, and go about obsessing over minor things that will make him happy.

I kept waiting for something to actually happen in this series, and it just didn't.  It's always been said that the TV show Seinfeld was a show about nothing, but it could really learn from this anime what nothing is.  Of course there goes all the humor and interest for anyone with an IQ of more than 2.  I've noticed at other anime vendors, that the price of this series is seriously high since it's recently been released.  If you really must have it wait, this will hit the discount bins with a big thud very soon.

Comparing this to Love Hina, Tenchi Muyo, or other ""Harem"" anime is like comparing Saving Private Ryan to an A-Team episode, it just doesn't wash. I can't really complain about the animation or art designs here, they are what they are, and that's not bad. Music is forgettable as is most everything else about this series.  Add a few stars if you collect bears from the Disney store, take away the lone star if you like stories like Evangelion or Lain.",1144886400,4,1439,4.538759689922481
8033347,5,B0002VKZLQ,"The premise of Sister Princess is that Wataru Minakami, an ordanary young man, is made to live with 12 lovable ""little sisters"", each with their own distant quirks and personality. Both ""little sister"" characters and the plotline of ""being forced to live with beautiful girls"" are very common and popular in bishojo products.",1124668800,2,325,5.150943396226415
8033348,4,B0002VKZLQ,"Whatever your thoughts about anime are, along with whatever you've heard about this anime series by ADV Films, this series deserves a special look by those of you looking for something different. At first glance, the series seems more aimed at children with the light and tender-hearted plots wandering through this series but after watching the first four episodes of this new series I found myself drawn to these characters.

Why? It's not your usual puffy and teary-eyed anime. After watching the first episodes, whereas the main characters of the anime series are thoroughly introduced one by one the anime seems to take off on a beat on its own with the remaining episodes on this disk. If you're a fan of Ah! My Goddess, Love Hina or Tenchi Muyo then you're sure to love this wonderful series.",1104969600,2,799,4.7898550724637685
8033349,5,B0002VKZLQ,"""What would you do if you had 12 sisters?""  This is the tagline for ADV Films US release of one of the most popular bishoujo series coming out of Japan.  Sister Princess is the story of 12 cute sisters who love their one and only brother very much.  Initially, this concept might freak out a lot of people, but don't worry, nothing really ever  happens in that sense.  This is actually a really cute and fun series.  There are a wide range of characters of varying ages and personalities from the adorable and shy Aria, the mysterious Chikage, the peppy junior detective Yotsuba, the flirtatious Sakuya, to the good girl Karen.  One of the unique aspects of this series is the different ways that each of the girls refer to their brother, which have been translated to the English equivalent in the dub from the original Japanese form.

The background information about this series is that it was featured in a bishoujo gaming magazine in Japan called G's magazine from 1999 to 2003, and has been very popular in the Japanese video game market.  This release is Season 1 of the anime consisting of 26 episodes.  Season 2 known as Sister Princess RePure consists of 13 episode and is a different story altogether, since it is more closely related to the original stories of the video games and G's magazine.  RePure as of current has not been licensed for US release at this time.

The story of this 1st season itself focuses on Wataru Minakami, a bright student who was planning to go to a prestigious school with his classmates Akio and Minai.  Unfortunately, he screws up his entrance exam, and instead is shipped off by his butler to Stargazers Hill West University on an island without warning, as he's been accepted to the school by recommendation.  When he arrives on the island, he meets several really cute girls, who he eventually finds out are his sisters, and they've come to the island to live with him.  At the same time, who is this 13th girl who keeps spying on him and pretends to be his sister as well?  Will Wataru's life ever return to normal?  Then again, would he really want to with 12 sisters who absolutely adore him?

Being my favorite series as of current, I would recommend this title for those who enjoyed the series Love Hina and Happy Lesson.  A series with lots of cuteness in which you'll most likely come out of with at least one favorite sister out of the twelve if not more.",1097193600,22,2409,4.56046511627907
