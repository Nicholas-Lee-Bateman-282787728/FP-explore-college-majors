1082828,3,6305836965,"This was a decent midnight movie- my friends and I definately got a kick out of it.  2 am, crammed in a small college dorm, and completely blazed is the way to watch a film like this.  H.G. Lewis, ""The Godfather of  Gore,"" certainly knows how to cram together as much graphic violence  and gore as he possibly can during the murder scenes.  The detective,  although irritating at times (okay- many times), can be entertaining to pay  attention to.  The real gems, of course, are the cheesy strip shows.  This  movie must have been shot in super 8, because often all the white comes in  as bright lime green (I love his car in that shade).  Overall,  ""Gore-Gore Girls"" is worth a rent sometime. Anyway, we watched  this as a companion to Dario Argento's ""Suspiria""- which is  without a doubt the supirior film.  Reguardless, it was an interesting  double-feature...everyone's got to have a midnight movie marathon once and  awhile.",958262400,2,930,4.7421383647798745
1082829,3,6305836965,"H. G. Lewis really goes all out in this film, one of his last gore epics. The plot, set in and around a strip-club, concerns the string of murders of beautiful young girls....that's original! But the scenes of murder on  display here  are worse than ever, with one girl's head being held under  boiling oil in a kitchen fryer, a hot iron being pressed into a face, and  the famous scene of a girl's nipples being cut off with scissors. It all  sounds appalling, but on viewing, it actually strikes you as ridiculous,  which is a relief! The rest of the film concerns the ""Keystone  Cops"" style hunt for the killer by a male-female partnership, which,  for a change, is pretty entertaining on its own, as are the hilarious  scenes where the dozy strippers are interviewed in search of clues.  Incidentally, the scenes of the girls actually performing strip shows in  the club are absolutely priceless, and bound to bring the house down (with  laughter) when watched. If you like a good turkey of a movie and can  stomach the grosser than gross atrocities on display, you will be glad you  got this film.",957398400,5,1102,4.61340206185567
1082926,4,6305836965,"If you're looking for a really dumb, gore flick The Gore Gore Girls is hilarious and right up your alley. Strippers are being killed in very amusing & gory ways. Although it is ""gory"" it is gory in the green pea puke from Exorcist sort of way. In other words it's obvious they use plastic body parts etc. Not scary at all and I scare pretty easily. Also be prepared for some horribly bad but funny one-liners from the lead investigator. Overall it's a pretty amusing cult film.",1237420800,2,477,4.431818181818182
1082927,4,6305836965,"I received this as a Christmas present. I loved all the gore scenes, even though they looked incredibly fake. It had some un-intentionally funny moments. A reporter named Nancy Weston hires an obnoxious private investigator named Abraham Gentry to investigate the murders of strippers and asks questions and then some radical feminist group break in, trying to stop the women from stripping.. He goes to the strip club and asks questions. Later, he gets the idea to trap the killer by making Nancy pose as a stripper to catch the killer. Again, I loved all the gore and was better than other Herschell Gordon Lewis films. I highly recommend THE GORE GORE GIRLS!!!",1230854400,,663,4.876106194690266
1082928,3,6305836965,"This movie was pretty lame. The music selection was awful and used at the most inapropriate times. There was marching band music durring a go-go dance. The cast just got on my nerves and the gore wasn't disturbing at all. After the killer cuts a girl's eye out, he puts it back in just to stab it out with a fork... Why? Watch the Wizard of Gore instead.",1224720000,,354,4.220588235294118
1082929,1,6305836965,"This film has been banned in Australia and will not have a dvd release. How the censorship board could find a badly made horror film from 1972,  too graphic for public consumption is confusing.  This film plays more like a comedy because of the bad production values (yes gore also), why is this unavailable to adults?  Yes, there is violence against women, but have the censors seen the brutal violence on display in ""Irreversible""? Have they released the dvd? Yes!
What is happening to our freedom of choice?",1208649600,4,510,4.7727272727272725
1082930,1,6305836965,"This is the only Herschell Gordon Lewis film I've seen, and it will be the only one.  It's pretty awful.  I rented it because HG Lewis fans swear this is the best one, but it's just crappy, and, no, not good crap.  The gore is actually pretty fake looking, and the performances here are damn abysmal.  You're not expecting grade A award winning material here, but dammit it should be at least passable.  The plot is just another run of the mill serial killer plot.  There's really nothing worth seeing here.  It was a chore to sit through this, but it taught me something worthwhile.  I'm not a fan of Lucio Fulci, but his films are better than this one.  I never thought I would say/write that.",1201219200,,695,4.409448818897638
1082931,4,6305836965,"John Waters sites Russ Meyer and Lewis as his two favorite film directors... and after watching this film, the influence is obvious.  GORE GORE is basically a mix of campy, over the top dialgoue, bad acting  -- yet a director (and crew) who seemed to really be having a lot of fun- - but not taking themselves too seriously.  It the end, it made this (and many of Lewis's other films) GREAT... no matter how deceptively bad they were.  (I say deceptively, because the idea of using graphic violence as a sublimation for graphic sex in the era of ""porno chic"" was definitely a powerful, even if unintentional social statement.

As for GORE GORE, its a slasher/murder mystery film set at a sleazy go go bar and featuring an appearence with Henny Youngman... cool groovy (as well as corny) music embellished with a bit of bizarre psychadelic incidental music and even a bit of groovy soul Jazz spice up the soundtrack...  and '70s porno chic quality acting... and actually pretty good cutting and shooting considering the budget - - who else but Lewis could pull it off... ???

A cult classic, there's nothing overhyped about this film... Though I imagine that few people today vomit at the site of store bought organ meat and bucketloads of fake blood (millions of films have followed in its wake) - - its '70s sleeze at its best...  the dialogue is really funny... actually plenty of Henny Youngman style one liners (that repeat themselves over and over).  -- - The film is held together by a effeminate Eric Idol meets David Lockary lounge lizard of a Private Eye... and plenty of hot looking strippers.  As for the gore, takes about 15 minutes into the film...  While Lewis's imagination and special effects are worlds apart... the scenes are funny... For example, they will always have something clever about them, but then go overboard to the point you can tell that its a plastic dummy that's being hacked up (or should I say getting a face lift... nyar, nyar, nyar, nuar...)  Then in between lot's of goofy dialogue, a few strip routines, more bad acting and general weirdness... and finally... more strange and imaginative gore.  (I'll never eat french freis again - - not atleast without laughing!)

All in all, a bad movie, but cut in a way that with the right herbal embellishments you can really really get into it... - - Years ago, people went to the movies expecting to be entertained - - and it is no wonder that to this today Lewis is idolized as not only the godfather, but the greatest of the genre...

Incidentally, this film was definitely shot before the era of Crime Scene Reality TV... the mass murderer in his film KILLS his victims instantly THEN tortures them... talk about a kinder gentler society... My favorite is the scene where he spanks his victim to death with a wooden meat tenderizer, causing (as I recall) her eyes to pop out, or something like that... then *after* she passes rubbing salt into the wounds...  Talk about a true bonified sicko...",1191628800,,2979,4.689059500959693
1082932,4,6305836965,"Well, Lewis will never be confused with Argento that's for sure.  There are similarities to the Italian giallo pictures, but this is a Lewis film all the way.  A killer's knocking off strippers and a snobby investigator and a journalist are on the case.  That's about it.  Lewis seems to be trying to outdo the gore of his previous films, and at times he succeeds.  But as gory and sadistic as it is, this film is a comedy through and through.  The whole thing is tongue in cheek making it easy to laugh with the film rather than at it for being cheap and silly.  A good portion of chuckles comes from the investigator, Gentry, with his high falootin', arrogant, insulting and sarcastic attitude.  The guy is almost like a cartoon character, and certainly wouldn't be able to go about like he does in real life without getting his teeth knocked out.  His sarcastic, low key response to the killer's demise is hilarious...so is the killer's demise itself come to think of it.  I also didn't realize back in 72, some people referred to their homes as ""cribs"" like they do today.  Learn something new everyday, huh?  Though comedic, I couldn't recommend it to just anyone, coz the violence could certainly be off putting, even for some horror fans.  But anyone reading a Herschell Gordon Lewis movie review knows what they're getting into, so enjoy.",1178496000,2,1346,4.676595744680851
1082933,5,6305836965,"This has got to be the most outrageous gore flick I have ever seen and by far the funniest.  The gore effects in this movie are so outlandish that it is actually not frigthening at all but extremely humorous (for those of us with a taste for black humor).  A movie like this could only have been created by the ""Godfather of Gore"" Herschell Gordon Lewis.  Known for his mix of sex and extreme gore, Lewis out does himself in this one as Go-Go girls at a nightclub are hacked to pieces one by one.  A hot iron is used to melt the face of one helpless victim, another has her face fried in french fry oil, still another has her rear end turned into hamburger meat and of course the infamous scene where a girl has her nipples cut off (the left bossom spews out whole milk while the right spews out chocolate milk!).  Faces are mutilated, eyeballs are squished, and even the killer appears to have a dark sense of humor (a lit cigarette is found between the toes of one dead girl and the word ""OK"" is written on her leg in blood).  There is even a cameo by the ""King of the one-liners"" Henny Youngman (who denies ever having been in this film to this day).  After making this film, Lewis retired from the film making business and went on to become a successful investor.  That is untill 2002 when he is coaxed back into the director's chair for ""Blood Feast 2: All you can eat"".  Gorehounds will LOVE this flick...most others will be repulsed by it but then again, that is the point of the movie.",1107993600,9,1493,4.284697508896797
1082934,5,6305836965,"Ladies and gentlemen! H.G. Lewis, the Godfather of Gore, proudly presents an amazing shockfest of striptease slaughter! Released in 1972, the ""Gore Gore Girls,"" a stomach-churning and brain-twisting follow-up to Lewis's infamous ""Wizard of Gore,"" is one of the first horror films ever to be rated X! While assembled upon a generous budget of $63,500, ""The Gore Gore Girls"" is a cult masterpiece of blood, black humor, and burlesque. With its smart dialogue, laughable acting, and plenty of bare exposure, this movie will entertain and nauseate even today's audiences. Best of all, despite the slightly crude subject matter, the overall content manages to stay risque without excessive raunch.
Actor Frank Kress adapts the role of Abraham Gentry, a snobbish and arrogant private eye who is offered $25,000 to investigate a series of gruesome murders. He's hired by an attractive Globe reporter named Nancy Weston (Amy Farrell), who will do anything for a scandalous story. Thinking that Nancy is merely a novice in solving crimes, Kress doesn't want anything to do with her, and he doesn't make that obvious just by whipping his cane around. Thanks to his charms, poor Nancy spends the entire second half of the movie drunk on zombies and tequila shots (not to mention the winner of an amateur strip contest). Still, the two manage to travel from one strip bar to another. Audiences will be given the pleasure of watching several voluptuous women in their tassels and pasties...up, close, and personal. Eventually, Abraham and Nancy gather enough clues to target four suspects:
Joseph - a shy student who was seduced and jilted by the killer's first victim, Suzy Creampuff.
Grout - a sadistic ex-marine who crushed and disfigured the faces of several Viet Cong soldiers.
Mary - a radical feminist who thinks that topless dancers are degrading to women.
Marlene - a fuming barmaid who was once a famous female wrestler, only to have her perfect figure horribly disfigured in a fire.
A lot of dark and sexual comedy is laced in the plotline. Viewers will especially enjoy how Abraham's bon mots test the patience of the Police Department's hotheaded Lieutenant. Not only does Abraham refuse to provide accurate information to the Lieutenant, but he even tricks him into thinking that the killer is a devout Christian! And, of course, let's not forget the outrageous stand-up comedy of Henny Youngman, who plays the ambitious club owner Marzdone Mobilie.
Meanwhile, the mysterious psychopath is killing the dancers one by one, slashing their throats and mangling their bodies beyond recognition. Like ""The Wizard of Gore,"" this movie makes the art of mutilation the main attraction. Even before the opening credits appear, the murderer grabs Suzy Creampuff by the hair and smashes her face against a glass mirror! From there, each victim's demise gets more grisly than the last, and the seemingly cheap effects will make viewers cringe to this day. In the film's latter half, Lola, a ditzy lady with false eyelashes, is attacked by the unnamed psychopath, who then bludgeons her buttocks with a meat tenderizer! The final two murders are perhaps the grossest ones ever to be filmed. The sick assailant burns one woman's face with an iron. Then, he/she has the other victim's skin sizzled in a pot of cooking oil!
If you are a fan of H.G. Lewis's lurid legacy, ""The Gore Gore Girls"" is worth buying. But, it's not for the easily squeamish. In fact, once you see this movie, you will never want to eat french fries again!",1075766400,13,3515,5.0
1082935,4,6305836965,"In 1963 Herschell Gordon Lewis, an independent filmmaker known for making cutie pictures, changed forever the face of American cinema when he released ""Blood Feast."" This film, about as low budget as you could possibly get even in the 1960s, kicked off the era of the gore film. While it would be quite some time before Hollywood caught on to the fact that certain segments of movie audiences hungered for films containing nauseating scenes of explicit violence, H.G. Lewis took one look at the receipts for ""Blood Feast"" and decided he better quickly make another movie similar to this one. What followed was a series of gruesome zero budget shockers, films like ""The Gruesome Twosome,"" ""A Taste of Blood,"" ""2000 Maniacs,"" ""The Wizard of Gore,"" and his final cinematic gore masterpiece ""The Gore-Gore Girls."" Lewis retired after making this 1972 picture in order to concentrate on a career in advertising, an endeavor he found much more profitable than his work in the film business. It wasn't until 2002 that the director returned to form with ""Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat,"" a movie which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Godfather of Gore still has what it takes to gross out an audience.
A gruesome series of murders committed against some local club employees inspires a newspaper to offer a boatload of money to famous private detective Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress, a guy who looks a lot like Sydney the psychiatrist from M*A*S*H). The contact between the tabloid and Gentry is one Nancy Weston, an eager reporter who quickly develops a thing for the arrogant investigator. Abraham agrees to take the case and immediately begins prowling the local go-go clubs, asking questions about the victims and narrowing down his field of potential suspects. One man in particular, a Vietnam veteran with the odd habit of squashing fruit, initially attracts Gentry's attentions. Another suspect turns out to be the head of a small cell of rabid feminists who routinely turn up at the clubs to protest the squalid behaviors of its denizens. The case would probably be resolved in a speedier manner if Gentry didn't have such an annoying personality. He ambles around dressed in a three-piece suit with cane, making it a habit to insult everyone from a sniffling bartender (played by Ray Sager of ""The Wizard of Gore"" fame) to an obnoxious waitress to the owner of a string of clubs named Marzdone Mobilie (Henny Youngman, of all people). He even misleads the local police with a crazy story about a bible-toting killer just so he can solve the case and collect the award.
Meanwhile, the killer continues the rampage. Herschell Gordon Lewis created some nasty looking special effects during the course of his career, but the scenes of carnage in ""The Gore-Gore Girls"" plumbs the depths of sadism. Describing all of the crimes here in gruesome detail probably won't do, but if you can imagine the effects of bobbing for French fries or the result of applying a hot clothing iron to flesh, you are half way there. Even worse, Herschell plays some of the scenes for laughs, with the grisly highlight involving both chocolate and regular milk. One scene involves a head and a car that equals, if not surpasses, a similar situation in Troma's ""The Toxic Avenger."" Lewis's final film is only for the stoutest souls, those hardy individuals inured to this type of stuff because they have watched dozens of horror films. Weak hearted people should probably stay well away. Besides, if you cannot stand terrible acting, go-go dancers with about as much onstage energy as a group of geriatrics, or canned jazz music as a soundtrack you won't make it through this one anyway.
""The Gore-Gore Girls"" initially resembles a giallo film. A black-gloved killer toting a whole mess of sharp instruments spends a whole lot of time tracking down decidedly unattractive go-go dancers in order to kill them. The first murder looks like it is straight out of a Dario Argento film. If it looks, tastes, smells, and feels like a giallo, it must be a giallo, right? Wrong! This is H.G. Lewis, the Godfather of Gore. The emphasis here is on shocking the audience to the core of its being rather than wasting a huge amount of time building up suspense, investing energy in coming up with inventive camera angles, or constructing a complex plot. Instead, ""The Gore-Gore Girls"" gives you lots of seedy atmosphere, pedestrian pacing, and amateurish editing (some of the dance sequences run on for WAY too long). One bright spot is the actress who plays Nancy Weston, a nice looking redhead out of place in a Herschell Gordon Lewis film unless you take into account her lousy acting skills. Yes, the film is painful to watch, but you know if you are a Lewis fan you will do it anyway and you will enjoy the trip.
The DVD is another winner in the Lewis catalogue. The director's commentary illuminates many of the hassles both big and small encountered during the production shoot, as well as providing lots of laughs over Lewis's philosophy about making low budget films. As for the picture quality, well, it leaves a lot to be desired. Colors look overexposed on numerous occasions, although that is probably how the movie looked when it was originally shot because anyone familiar with Lewis's films knows he had only a rudimentary knowledge about lighting a scene. Not my favorite Lewis film, ""The Gore-Gore Girls"" is still an important entry in the Lewis canon due to the over the top gore and the fact that it was the last film the director made for nearly thirty years.",1072224000,4,5547,4.8277310924369745
1082975,5,6305836965,"For those unfamiliar with HGL, I would recommend seeing Blood Feast first, for all others, skip the mediocre films that followed and go staight to the Gore Gore Girls.  Don't get me wrong, his other films are entertaining in their own right if you are a fan of 'bad' cinema; however, this film is quintasencial 'bad' cinema.  This is HGL at his finest, superbly combining slap-stick humour with over-the-top, albeit ridiculously executed, gore and violence.  Do not approach this film expecting a horror film.  It is not.  It is an hilarious comedy that happens to be exhuberantly bloody (but in a darkly, twistedly funny way).  You will never look at a glass of chocolate milk the same way again after viewing this film.  Again, those familiar with HGL's work know that his films are far from 'slick'.  They are characterized by rudamentary camera work, baddest of the bad acting, minimal production values, all doused liberally in vibrantly red blood.  If these weren't present, they wouldn't be HGL films and they would certainly suffer for it.  This is what exploitation filmmaking is all about, brilliantly executed by the master himself.

I love my gore and gruesome films but this film did something awful to my mental health. If you are of a strong mental type then go ahead and watch it, HG Lewis never intended that his films would warp people but this film will never leave me. Even if it is wanky ancient special effects, the sheer brutality of this film is not to be underestimated. If you can handle it - go ahead by all means. I wish I could do so. But if you are a troubled soul don't bother. I have lasting nightmares. Even if HG Lewis didn't intend it, thats how it is........",1064102400,6,812,3.957317073170732

The ""Gore Gore Girls"" does not fail to entertain this heretofore unexplored demographic. It's hilarity is undisputed. And, yes, Lewis knew he was making comedy.
I don't think it's as good as 1963's ""Bloodfeast"" or even 1964's ""Two Thousand Maniacs,"" which, as the first gore films ever released in America, have a much higher historical and cultural importance and are, in fact, primary historical source material.
The ""Gore Gore Girls"" is an anarchic, nihilistic parody of its times, and it would be enjoyed by followers of Sade, Hobbes, and Malthus today. Feminists are sure to love the premise of the film, which I refuse to divulge.

Of course you haven't.  H.G. Lewis didn't break the rules, he invented them....he is the inventor of the gore film.
  For those of you who may have rented this from the dingy 50c bin at your local video store all those years ago, you'll be delighted to know that the picture on this dvd is lovely, and the director commentary is illuminating and hilarious!

1082979,3,6305836965,"Herschell G Lewis is one sick puppy!! Anyone who has seen any of his gore movies will realize I mean this as very high praise. Many thought this would be his last movie, but thankfully he's come back recently with a sequel to BLOOD FEAST (which isn't available in NZ to my knowledge). GORE GORE GIRLS sees Lewis going into overdrive, the humor is blacker than before; the gruesome sequences are repulsive and of course there are endless sequences of go-go girls shaking their groove thangs to campy, bizzare jazz music composed by none other than Mr Lewis, under the name Sheldon Seymour. The plot (what there is of it) revolves around a detective and a reporter investigating the violent deaths of strippers at a night club. We are subjected to hilarious sequences of feminists picketing the club (one placard says LEWD IS CRUDE)and awful dialogue (""I'll tell you one thing, this murderer sure isn't weak"" and ""You're resting your foot on my crutch""). The stripping sequences themselves are more embaressing than titillating, but Mr Lewis outdoes himself in scenes featuring an iron, a deep fryer and demonstrates a novel way of dispensing chocolate milk. And how could you forget the meat tenderiser scene, the movie's pice de rsistance? All these grim delights make up for the movie's flagging bits. (And that goes for some of the strippers too). When you watch GORE GORE GIRLS there is no doubt you are watching cheap garbage, but the difference is this is cheap garbage made by a marketing genius. So grab a nice rare rump steak and a big glass of chocolate milk and sit yourself down in front of the box for what could well be the most gruesome eighty minutes of your life.
This is only the third Lewis movie I've seen after BLOOD FEAST and GRUESOME TWOSOME. I just hope our censors let more through. Gore fans shouldn't be denied these movies. They're part of horror history.",1034035200,3,1882,4.740853658536586

I love this movie. Although this is considered Lewis' worst and most violent, You can find charm in all this drudge. The story centers around a string of murders involving go-go dancers in Chicago. A newspaper reporter named Nancy Weston is sent to hire a world class detective named Abraham Gentry to solve these hideous crimes. So they start on their investigation by lounging around go-go bars while Nancy makes goo-goo eyes at the obviously gay Abraham. You see every attempt for any woman to seduce him is turned down with a queeny remark or a painful bruise caused by his ever present cane.
The murders are inventive, Face in pot of boiling french fries, A meat tenderizer to the buttocks, Face smashed into a mirror, Slashed throat, Etc. The whole atmosphere of the film is almost like a parody of a slasher flick before they even existed. Their is plenty of dry humor and nonsense. Some of the strippers are eyesores, Particulary the black dancer who has too many stretch marks. And Abraham Gentry, Geeze, This guy makes Liberace look butch. This queen should be ON the stage instead of infront of it. Reporter Nancy Weston is definitely barking up the wrong tree.
Henny Youngman makes an appearance as a club owner so of course you have to hear his ancient humor for about three minutes. How he was coaxed into doing this kind of movie is a mystery. I guess it was more appealing to talk into a camera instead of a crowded room of mob bosses.

From the very beginning, you're vomitted into a world of smashed skulls and gouged eyeballs and it is beautiful.  There's enough spilt blood in this movie to make Vin Diesel question his manhood.  Fans of ""Blood Feast"" and ""Two Thousand Maniacs"" will find this to be a typical H.G. Lewis film: brilliant.  Fans of ""While you Were Asleep"" and ""Kate and Leopold"" will find this to be as entertaining as watching a garbage disposal accident (which is all the more reason for you to watch it).

The movie may have been bad, so bad in fact it's fun to watch! Better than Ghost Dog that's for sure! This is just the perfect movie to sit around with a bunch of friends and have a good laugh. then pick up your camcorder and make your own better movie.

1082983,2,6305836965,"I first rented this movie back in the 80's, when my friend opened a video store that carried every rare movie he could find. He also carried all the shock, horror, and exploitation movies he could dig up, and I went through almost of all them. Previously I had seen Blood Feast and 2000 Maniacs, and the Wizard of Gore. They were gruesome (especially for the time period), and the Wizard of Gore got pretty nasty. The Gore-Gore Girls, however, was the one I remember as being the most disgustingly gory.
  I rented it on DVD recently because I wanted to hear the commentary, and thought it might have some cool dancing and clothes. I forgot that it was made in the early 70's, so fashion had kind of gone downhill by then. I also realized this was a movie I didn't really need to see more than once. It had amusing parts, but gaaaah! It was much more disgusting than I remembered. I'm very jaded to movie gore but a couple of times I just got too grossed out and had to look away. This wasn't a good choice of movie to put on DVD all crisp and cleaned up with better sound and picture quality. The commentary is amusing in parts, and interesting (I think HG said the budget was $6100.00) Maybe HG Lewis wasn't feeling well that day, but he sounded tired overall (or at least a little uneven-he just didn't sound too excited) and also had the nerve to get offended when the interviewer from Something Wild compared him to Ed Wood Jr. Sorry pal, but you ain't exactly Martin Scorsese yourself.
  The extremely thin plot is about a series of murders of topless go-go dancers in strip clubs. A cute reporter and a really unattractive private detective team up (sort of-he can't seem to stand her) to try to solve the crimes. Henny Youngman owns a strip club. A bunch of really ugly murders happen.
  I'm going to apologize in advance because I don't want to sound like I have no sense of humor, but this movie was so misogynistic it pi$$ed me off more than the main character in""The Company of Men"". Please keep in mind that I do have some respect for HG Lewis as a director-anyone who John Waters devotes an entire chapter to in 'Shock Value' is OK with me. Mainly because in this movie, main character's and the director's extreme dislike for females- and the audience- just oozes from every frame. It's not just the murders. The highly unattractive detective goes out of his way to treat the female reporter like dog dirt at every opportunity, for no apparent reason,  (he's not exactly a threat to George Clooney, like I said) and she still follows him around like a puppy. She faints upon seeing a horribly mutilated body and he looks distastefully at her, then pours cold soda from a can onto her face to wake her up. Later he calls the police to report the crime- ""No...no hurry...she just seems to have...lost face.""  This guy is THE HERO. You can imagine how the other characters feel about women. I could go on and on but you get the idea. Please note that I am making this movie sound much more politically correct  (and much more fun) than it actually is.
  Most of the cast are the type of actors you pray will never take their clothes off- not too easy on the eyes, so don't watch the movie just to see the nudity unless you're not too picky. The go-go dancers all look like they desperately want to have the scene end so they can get their $10 or whatever the going rate HG paid them was and get their fix. OK, I'm being mean, for all I know the dancers were just unhappy due to the conditions they had to work under. It's not quite that bad, there was one dancer that looked like she might have been a pro and also one other cool dancer with a huge afro that didn't look as miserable as the rest, but still not too thrilled.  In my opinion, the only slightly entertaining things were a couple moments of brief unintentional humor, such as when a policemen in charge at a murder scene angrily yells ""Get outta here before I have you all arrested!""  not to a bunch of reporters but to some other policeman calmly going about their work. Henny Youngman is kind of funny though, like Lewis says, he said his lines so fast that they almost needed subtitles (I'm sure he was trying to get the whole day over in a hurry so he could get paid and get the hell out of there, though he doesn't look like he minded watching some strippers do their thing).
  My recommendation?  Might be worth seeing just out of morbid curiosity- for the era the movie was made, it was probably the most gruesome thing on film at the time- or if you're really big HG Lewis fan and find him or low-budget film-making by anyone fascinating. Otherwise, if you've seen it once, you've seen it and can move on to other disgusting but much more entertaining low-budget movies from the early 70's...this movie doesn't even come close to, say, ""Pink Flamingos"" when it comes to the skip-the-popcorn factor. If you've never seen an HG Lewis movie, I recommend you try ""Blood Feast"" first instead, you'll have a much better time, and you won't be left with such a bad taste in your mouth.",985132800,3,5061,4.408360128617363
1082984,2,6305836965,"Gore-hounds take note, ""The Gore Gore Girls"" is perhaps the most gruesome film made by Herschell Gordon Lewis. Of course, the viewer gets to witness some rather trashy strip sequences that contain more scares than the movie itself! Everything else is pretty standard: gross effects, bad acting (though there are a few surprises here, such as a guest appearance by ""The King Of the One-Liners"" Henny Youngman), and some absolutely awful directing! For the most part, I felt that this film was a meager step up from earlier Lewis films like ""The Gruesome Twosome"", and the jokes actually seemed more intentional this time!
The DVD is a well-done project, featuring a wonderfully candid HGL interview/commentary that tells you everything you wanted to know, or didn't want to know, about ""The Gore Gore Girls"". The other extras, especially the Goddess Of Gore segment, are also interesting for early-gore film fanatics.",978480000,3,916,5.154362416107382

7896221,3,6305836965,"Surprisingly, I was kind of disappointed with this one. Before the credits even begin, it starts off well with a gore sequence. However, I became uninterested in it between the violence. Sure enough, it definitely delivers some great gore. One of the best scenes occurs about 40 minutes into the film when a woman wearing a see-thru bra has her butt mashed to a bloody mess with a meat tenderizer, which is then followed by her having her eyeballs plucked out and squished. Another scene worth mentioning is a woman having her face burned to a mess with an iron. So, it sure delivers some extreme gore and violence, but it just has only a bit of topless and rear nudity. In between the gore, I personally thought it was boring. There's dancing at a club and boring filler stuff with uninteresting characters. Instead of some of this boring filler, I was expecting a higher body count because I only bought this for gore only. The film also delivers no effective atmosphere or locations where they filmed it. The comedic ending, when the guy talks to the viewer and says ""you've seen enough"" and pulls a black screen down on the camera, isn't something that I like because I don't want stupid humor like that in my horror.

That ""Peak at the Love Goddess of Gore"" extra is a quick and cool gore scene with a guy being disemboweled and then decapitated on an alter. There's also a Gordan Lewis exploitation art galley and a film commentary from Lewis. The DVD quality is really good.",1449705600,2,1481,4.588679245283019

7896227,5,6305836965,"This is my first and, so far, only Herschell Gordon Lewis movie I've ever seen, much less put in my DVD collection.  I must say that, as a connoisseur of fine cheeses, this one is quite delectable.

Being the last film made by Mr. Lewis in 1972, it's mainly tongue-in-cheek, while you can keep one in your head.  But don't worry; if you're not an early-seventies stripper working in Chicago, you're safe.  With names such as Suzie Creampuff, Candy Cane, and Lola Prize, these groovy go-go gals weren't being very modest, which kind of made them large targets for this particular killer.

Right off the bat, I must strongly agree as to how much Frank Kress, who played the hero, Abraham Gentry, private investigator par excellence (as he so modestly announces every five minutes), resembles Allan Arbus, who appeared several times in M*A*S*H as Dr. Sidney Freeman, psychiatrist.  His character is kind of a throwback to the thirties.  I was oh-so-slightly projecting Nick Charles' picky, arrogant, yet nattily-attired and gentlemanly nephew onto Mr. Gentry.

Said Mr. Gentry is wooed into helping Nancy Weston, girl-cub-reporter, to solve the case of the Chicago Stripper Killer And Creative Mutilator.  There's a ""spirited"" mob scene in one of the clubs, meaning that they all looked to be three sheets to the wind at the time.  Strippers are dispatched, french fries, cucumbers and chocolate milk are served, and the sleazy food chain is established.  A few hangover-free Zombies later, Miss Fancy Nancy finds herself entered into a stripping contest hosted by the owner of the local strip joints, Marzdone Mobilie, played by Henny Youngman (!).  I must admit, Henny did a good job in this.  Later he chose to absolve himself of ever appearing in this film.  Such a pity.

One of my favorite parts of this DVD is Something Weird's promo of some of their other juicy celluloid tidbits.  It had me cracking a wide smile the first time I saw it.  It also reminded me of John Waters' Serial Mom, the scene where one of its characters is watching a Chesty Morgan movie.  Plus, there's a clip from a movie featuring some wild women and a most hapless blond guy who's about to spill his guts to them.

If you never thought you'd meet a stripper talented enough to work to Strauss' Radetzky March or My Old Kentucky Home, this movie will set you straight, pickle!

Okay, having said all that, I have one question...in the very beginning of the movie, where the Hell did Mr. Gentry put his pretty black cat?  Was that a cat door?  I hope it was.",1241654400,7,2537,4.744292237442922
