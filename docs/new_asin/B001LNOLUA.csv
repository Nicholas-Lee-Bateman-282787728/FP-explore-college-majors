Two men arrive at a shack and talk about a meeting. One is not well and collapses, so does the other. A man enters and removes Jims revolver and shoots Bud! Jim id in jail now. Neil visits him, Jim tells what happened. Was he drugged? Afterwards a man tells that Jim Gray escaped, they will form a posse to catch him. Elsewhere a man is shot, his mail inspected. [A two-cent stamp for first class postage.] Jim finds that mans body and that planted letter. The Pinon Gang hamstrung eight ponies! Will they take revenge? Jim reports the death of Jim Dorgan (based on the name on the letter). Jim is misidentified as Dorgan by his horse. At the ranch riders shoot at the workers. One man was caught poisoning a water hole. Jim Gray is identified as Neil Denham. Neil notes the caliber of two pistols as .45's not .41 caliber. He says The General is trying to cause a fight between two groups so he can run people across the border.

Neil sleeps with his guns. Saunders will go to town for his rheumatism medicine. Saunders knows he is not Neil Denham but likes him. Jim tells Squint the truth, and to look out for anyone with papers as Neil Denham. Squint tells Neil he is out to get Jim Gray for shooting his brother! A Border Patrol agent was in town. There is a note to Neil asking if he will play the game. Neil writes his reply. Miss Marcia Brandon tells Neil what happened. Men arrive; Bell of the Border Patrol says Neil is dead. But a look at Neils handwriting settles the discussion. Bell got that note from three men at Hopes place. Bell says no one can talk to the prisoners. Neil talks to Bell about this. Neil and Squint ride to a place, they see riders with laden burros. Shoot at the smoke! One man is captured, gives a message for The General, then is released. Bell tells Neil his wife has arrived. Will this expose Jim? No, his wife plays along with Jims deception.

She is told Neil was killed in cold blood. Neils wife was sent a message, but Neil didn't send it. The General is behind this. They found a locket with Neil and his wifes portrait near the hamstrung ponies, said Miss Marcia. Neil cant explain right now. Bell told Hole that Neil is really Jim Gray! Jim Gray rides to look for Saunders. He approaches a stone house, and is captured. He finds Squint there. Jim is brought to The General and questioned. He is offered a test: to shoot Squint! Jim is given a gun and uses it against the gang. He and Squint escape, but Squint is hit. Miss Marcia sends her men to find Jim and Squint. Jim returns to rescue Squint. Bell returns to meet The General, Jim captures him and asks him to write a confession as Jordan. There is shooting. Jim tells Squint of his plans for marriage, a happy ending.

There must have been scenes edited out to reduce the running time implied by the storylines gaps. The story by Murray Leinster is more complex that the usual Western movies which usually involve swindles or thefts of individual property. The idea of crooked government agents was used in some Westerns, but often to serve a big cattle owner. The contraband items wasn't too clear. This is a story how the good guys triumph over adversity to win in the end. George F. Hayes from Buffalo NY plays the type of character seen in future movies.",1508112000,,3285,4.389162561576355
8319001,2,B001LNOLUA,"I've seen about 5 Harry Carey B westerns from the 1930s and all were entertaining. ""Border Devils"" is unfortunately one of the worst B westerns I ever saw. The pacing is terrible and the supporting players (except George Hayes) are awful in their deliveries. Even Harry Carey (one of my favorites) delivers his lines unconvincingly. The script is muddled as well. The scenery is terrific and this would probably have been a good silent western, as you wouldn't actually hear the static delivery of the cast. The director must have been dozing. I've given my copy away. Luckily it has been my experience that, in buying dvds of movies I've not seen before, such disappointment is a rare occurence. I've given this film 2 stars for the scenery, a decent print, and George Hayes.",1244937600,,776,4.798507462686567
