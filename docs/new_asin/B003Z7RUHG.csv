Cuentame is a must own for anyone with an interest in Spanish (Spain's) culture and history.  Each episode is approximately 1 hour and I would consider it a cinematic experience.  The cinematography, acting and story lines can't be beat.  The show starts in the late 60s and continues into the 80s.  Each season is a year in Spain's history.  Imagine the show 24, but instead of 24 hours, it's 12 months.  Now imagine the TV show the wonder years, but it takes place in Spain and is a million times better.  I forgot to mention that it helps if you're a fluent Spanish speaker and not offended by vulgarity or nudity.  If you watch the series on Spanish channels in the United Sates, it's completely censored and edited.",1364688000,3,831,4.443708609271523

Sorry, I'd be willing to pay maybe $20 a season but this is KRAZY!
How do they figure a dvd disc that costs less than a dollar and the packaging which costs maybe 30 cents is worth buying at this price??
Like the record companies - ripping people off for years for cd's that cost twice what they should have - I guess the dvd business is also looking to go belly up by gouging their customers!

My wife tells me this program is GREAT by the way and I wanted to buy it for her but - NOT at this price I won't!",1350432000,7,574,3.905982905982906
