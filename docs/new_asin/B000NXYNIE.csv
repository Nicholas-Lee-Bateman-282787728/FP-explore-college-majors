Throughout time, God had repeatedly reached out in love to His children by revealing this gospel to prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses. However, people repeatedly chose to reject the prophets and their teachings.

Two thousand years ago, God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to atone for the sins of the world and to overcome death. Jesus also taught His gospel, chose Apostles, and established His Church. He gave His Apostles priesthood authority to perform ordinances and directed them to take His gospel into all the world. But just as the prophets were rejected in previous ages, the people rejected and killed His Apostles. As a result, priesthood authority was taken from the earth.

Because of God's love for His children, He has reached out to us, just as He has done in the past. This video presents the glorious beginning of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in our time through the Prophet Joseph Smith. It confirms that our Heavenly Father heard a humble prayer and through Joseph restored the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ once again upon the earth. ---Taken from the back of the video case",1226361600,,1268,4.651785714285714
