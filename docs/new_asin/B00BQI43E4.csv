5665469,2,B00BQI43E4,"There are four 54 minute programs of which about 10% is repetitive hype, self promotion and advertising. The programs are a mix of racy hype, vast amounts of CG and virtually no meaningful science. No in depth explanations are offered on anything and some of Australia's most interesting geological sites like Uluru and the Bungle Bungles are passed by in seconds. Despite good picture and sound and excellent subtitles there is just too much hype, too much repetition and virtually no real science. Sadly - forget it!",1373328000,6,518,4.9655172413793105
5665470,4,B00BQI43E4,"I don't know if Australia's rocks are confirmed as the oldest ever found, but considering they found the first fossil bacteria in its rocks, Australia clearly can be used as a window the whole history of life and geology of the Earth.

Episode one tries to start from the beginnings of our solar system to the first episodes of life on Earth. As it turns out, for the majority of the Earth's existence, life never went beyond single cells.  Multicellular life mostly started at the Cambrian explosion around 500 to 600 Million years ago.  This was somewhat after the last 'iceball Earth' episode.  The idea of the whole Earth covered with ice is one of the most exciting Earth geology ideas of the past few decades(supervolcanoes would be another). As the Narrator says, this period is considered the most boring period for Paleontologists, biologists(except those trying to understand say genetic fossils in cellular dna, the origin of life and so on).  I'm kindof disappointed they didn't try to talk about the Gaia hypothesis and some of the latest ideas of chemical self-organization into the first cells.

The second and fourth episodes were the most exciting in my opinion.  These episodes have the most to say about diversity of life.  Some of the unexpected highlights in my opinion are the plant life during the Dinosaur period still living in Australia and associated Islands.  Also, they say some interesting things about the great barrier reef in episode 4. Also in episode 4, they get into some of the artwork of the Aborigines.

The third episode was about the Dinosaur era.  As they say, Dinosaur fossils were hard to come by for the longest time; so, they've just started to wright the Australian Dinosaur history.  Still, upon rewatching it a few times, I suppose it wasn't too bad.  I've never seen that many dinosaur footprints! I saw the Laetoli footprints of our Australopithacine ancestors of four million years ago when young(preteen) in Washington D.C. natural history museum; I have a thing for footprints!

This video will amaze those who don't know the geology, biological history of the Earth.  It's kind of fun for those who like to see lots of nature like me.  I for one don't know of a video that shows the history of life on Earth as good as this.",1372464000,21,2279,4.805128205128205
5665471,5,B00BQI43E4,"Australia's First 4 Billion Years, a set of two Blue-ray Discs, is simply magnificent.  These two Blu-ray Discs fill in a big hole in the knowledge that many viewers have about the geology, fauna, flora, and human inhabitants of Australia over a period of 4 billion years.  Superb photography, judicious comments of experts, well-done computer animation, and, last but not least, geologist Dr. Richard Smith bring to light the magnificence of the ""big, red, flat, and old"" country.  In summary, Dr. Richard Smith makes Australia accessible to a wide audience by keeping his coverage both erudite and entertaining.",1372464000,5,613,5.23469387755102

Yet the one being the recipient of grace to inhabit this planet in the past couple of hundred years has managed to create a disaster that will ruin the very world that houses them. And the irony of it all for so long we called what we were doing progress. When in fact we are merely hastening how demise. may reawaken to ourselves and in turn  feasts and desist from destroying ourselves. May we treat all the gifts that have been so gracefully bestowed upon us, like we want them and not like we have done then perhaps we won't lose them. We were given them only in the capacity of custodians doesn't it make sense to pass it on as pristine as we found it and if we alter anything let it be for good.

Otherwise, an excellent introduction to not only the history of Australia itself but the geologic history of Earth as a whole. Highly recommended.",1415318400,,534,4.8791208791208796

What I found so unsettling was that we humans evolved from a microbial bacteria in some primordial soup. The very air we breathe is a waste product from plant materials. There is so much geological information presented in this series that you will want to research it more to get your mind to grasp all that is described in this magnificent opus. The Aussie scientists speak plainly and you won't need English subtitles to understand their accents. Four Billion = 4x10 -9 (nine zeros). Your 80+ year lifetime is a mere 1/50,000,000 of geological earth time. From Pangaea to Gondwana super continents to now you will be confounded in awe from what you learn from this presentation.

The 1st episode of this series has a very ingenious way of explaining exactly how long 4 billion years is by comparing it to how far (& long) you would drive using a ""special"" GPS unit that takes you back 1 million years for each hour of driving.

Darwin recanted his ""theory"" of evolution before he died because he realized he was about to meet the maker of it all.

It takes blind faith to believe in evolution. Christian faith is the substance of things in which we know exist. The evidence of things that cannot be seen with human eyes. Just like the wind and electricity. You can't see them but you can see the effects of them.

5665946,4,B00BQI43E4,"I'm a nature, history, and natural history documentary junkie. I'll watch just about any I come across, which means that I've seen some spectacular ones (Planet Earth still takes the cake) and some really, really abysmal ones (The Celts and Micro Planet ::shudder::).

Almost anything that PBS puts out or even affiliates itself with is a sure bet to be decent at worst and phenomenal at best, especially in their Nova and Nature productions. Australia leans toward the higher end without being quite phenomenal.

Loves:

The story of Australia itself is wildly interesting. Some of the oldest rocks on Earth can be found there, and it's been through a LOT of changes in the 4 billion years they cover. I've seen several different shows on the continent but none that explain its geologic and natural history so well and in depth. The amount of information provided in each episode is enough that you're really learning a lot, but is presented in a light enough way that it doesn't feel like a lecture. Additionally, the narrator/guide is really good. He may not be David Attenborough, but that's not his fault, and he does very well in spite of that handicap.

Had to learn to love:

The story telling style. The premise is that you and the narrator are going back in time by the power of some magical car that goes a million miles an hour. They thread that throughout and use it as a transition when going between different time periods. At first I found it a little cutesy and annoying, but by the 2nd or 3rd episode it didn't bother me. It's well done so it doesn't become a distraction or make things too stilted/awkward.

Didn't really love:

The CG. Some of it is pretty okay, and then some is rather ridiculous. However, it's a PBS show made on a meager budget so it's not like they could hire James Cameron.

TL;DR: Informative, fun, well made, and fairly innovative. Watch if you like Australia, natural history, or documentaries in general.",1402617600,12,1951,4.700879765395895

(Deep time is a concept that wasn't actually explained during the program, although the term is used more than once.)

For someone who has some background knowledge of current understanding of our solar system's formation, and who has studied geology and paleontology, it was fun to watch.  For someone coming into these subjects without a lot of previous exposure, it would be a bit too cursory in coverage of many of the topics.

5665985,3,B00BQI43E4,"This DVD covers four billion years, in four one-hour episodes. That's ambitious! Understandably, this DVD cannot cover anything in great detail, and ends up being somewhat superficial.

It wastes time with a silly analogy about the narrator driving his SUV into ""deep time"". It's obvious they put a lot of effort into this analogy. But to me the analogy was just a gimmick, and did not help understanding. If nothing else, if that SUV drove any amount of time into the past, there wouldn't even be roads! The camera work in this DVD is often gimmicky, beyond the ""deep time"" SUV. That detracts from the DVD. The gimmick sequences add ""excitement"" with their rapid cuts and throbbing music, but no real meaning. Perhaps the idea was to make science attractive to high school students with short attention spans. Even there, my guess it the gimmicks will just lead to hyperactivity in the students, and short attention spans remain.

The DVD is narrated by an enthusiastic scientist. The DVD mostly presents good science. That's why I gave the DVD three stars. And Australia is a good ""case history"", because the rocks on the continent are so old, and stromatolites still live in Shark Bay. But the presentation is somewhat superficial, and the format is distracting.

I found the idea of the ""boring billion"" ridiculous and superficial. We used to think ""junk DNA"" was boring or random. It's not. The same here. Life was constantly evolving during that one billion year period. There is an understandable idea to make biology more ""entertaining"" by focusing on big creatures, like dinosaurs. But bacteria are just as important, if not more so. Life started with the single celled organisms, and all the basic metabolic pathways evolved in them first. The DVD could have debunked the idea of the ""boring billion"".

The DVD constantly harps on ""the ocean rusting"". I think it would have been better to explain a little about iron being oxidized, different oxidation states of iron. The ocean itself was not rusting. Another quibble is that the DVD presents pictures of bacterial ""fossils"", and fails to explain that some bacterial fossils are controversial. Other scientists think some of the less well-defined bacterial fossils are natural rock formations not related to biological fossils.

So, overall, an OK but flawed documentary.",1398902400,4,2332,5.0310880829015545

Then I realized that my fundamental fascination with the topic was getting repeatedly interrupted by the tedious, gimmicky camera work and editing. When I first saw ""Written, directed and produced by Richard Smith"" I felt a slight unease, and it turned out to be warranted. The guy should have gotten more outside input and ideas rather than just presuming his own personal quirks would be well-received by the audience.

5666086,5,B00BQI43E4,"The spectacular and peculiar plants and animals of Australia are showcased in this superb NOVA presentation. Although it is crammed with the latest in research from the field, it is thoroughly enjoyable for a general audience. Hosted by geologist/biologist Richard Smith, in the course of four hours we are taken on a journey through 4 billion years of Earth history as seen in Australia, our planet's smallest, oldest, flattest, hottest and driest continent. The mini continent may be flat and dry, but this four-part natural history program is anything but. With a rock-solid foundation of geological knowledge, the story of life is rolled out before us like a scroll, utilizing truly remarkable high-definition photography of the deserts, seacoasts, coral reefs and ancient forests of Australia.

This is a marvelous introduction to the origins of the rock forms and life forms that make up the Earth we know today. The first of the four one-hour episodes is entitled ""Awakenings"", and covers the majority of the four billion years of Australia's history, a time when there was a lot of geological activity but relatively little biological action going on. Like life on Earth itself, the story starts out slowly as life finds a foothold in the sea with simple organisms like the cyanobacteria that created the odd mounds called stromatolites, which are among the oldest evidence of life on Earth. Eventually life invades the land with creatures like the sea scorpion (eurypterids). The second episode, ""Life Explodes"", chronicles from the Cambrian explosion of life through the Permian extinction, the greatest mass dying in Earth's history. ""Monsters"" is the name of the third episode, detailing the Mesozoic Era (""middle life""), which for the general public is the best known of geologic eras due to the existence of the dinosaurs. Encompassing the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous, the Mesozoic was brought to an end by the most famous of all mass extinctions, the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs and most other life of the time.

The Cretaceous extinction enabled the rise of small, furry, rat-like survivors that grew to dominate the planet, including Australia, in the Age of Mammals. Episode four is entitled ""Strange Creatures"" because, unlike any other continent, until quite recently the mammalian population of Australia was almost exclusively marsupials, the pouched mammals. Marsupials are one of the hallmarks of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, which was comprised of what later became Africa, South America, India, Antarctica, and Australia. Another famous marker of that ancient land is the glossopteris flora, ancient tree fossils found in all continents which originated as part of Gondwana.

This NOVA natural history presentation is similar to the extremely high quality BBC nature programs such as Planet Earth. But it has its own distinctive style, with excellent computer graphic simulations, satellite photos to locate areas of special interest, and the finest in live-action footage from the areas it discusses. Richard Smith is a knowledgeable and affable guide to the wonders of Australia, and he presents a subtle message with his volumes of facts: the Earth is beautiful, fragile, and worthy of being cherished. There is no heavy-handed preaching, but instead a carefully crafted video homage to the history of our planet.

Don't miss this one. Like Australia itself, it is unique.",1389657600,,3435,5.3088235294117645

5666089,5,B00BQI43E4,This documentary does a really good job of putting the geologic history of Australia in cosmic perspective.  It is well-narrated and the visuals are outstanding.  It is also designed to appeal to both children and adults.  Another winner from PBS NOVA!,1386806400,5,252,5.097560975609756
5666090,5,B00BQI43E4,"Another winner from PBS's Nova!  Beautifully filmed in Australia, New Zealand and the Arctic Sea just north of Alaska.  Hosted by Richard Smith and decorated with stunning digital effects and covering billions of years of natural history, the program takes you on a road trip to the beginning of life on Earth.  On the way Smith makes several stops to observe our fragile planet and it's inhabitants for each time period he comes across.  What stood out for me was Australia's fantastic landscape; arid deserts, dense tropical rain forest, rugged coastlines, and those incredibly ancient mountains.  The ""Giant Down-Under"" has it all; thermal hot-springs, snow covered peaks while nearby New Zealand and Antarctica sport extensive snow fields and glaciers.  Add some hot-water geysers in New Zealand and you'll get an idea of what the early Earth looked like.  The scenic shots alone are worth the price of admission.  Topping it all off the film showcases Australia's, and Tasmania's, unique plant and animal life, both living and extinct.  During his road trip through the ""out back"" Smith stops now and then to talk to several other scientist about Australia's prehistoric past.  One of them was Tim Flannery who gives you an overview of some recent extinctions caused by humans (see my review on his book A Gap In Nature). Some of the oddities you'll see are the Stromatolites in Sharks Bay and one of the oldest ""clonal trees"" in existence; the Huon Pine in Tasmania. Also viewed are giant prehistoric kangaroos, an extinct Monitor Lizard called Megalania that was a good 15 to 20 feet long.  For most of it's history Australia's mammals were marsupials and monotremes but then some 40 to 60 thousand years ago a newcomer arrived by boat: Humans.  The arrival of this invader coincided with the decline and extinction of Australia's Mega Fauna but some researchers feel that climate change may have been the ultimate cause.  The now extinct Tasmanian Tiger makes it's last appearance in archival footage taken just after the turn of the 20th Century.  It seems that the Tiger may have gotten the last laugh, or at least the last bite, just before checking out.  As much as I enjoyed this four part film there are a few things I would change if it were up to me.  One; the Intro that starts each episode is way too long and so were the recaps of the previous episodes.  I would have cut them both by at least 50%.  Regardless, I'm still glad I made this purchase and highly recommend this DVD.

Now, I've never been to the land down under and frankly don't have much interest in it per se, but I do enjoy the topic of going back in time.  The focus on Australia has opened a whole new view of the country's beginnings and along with the intelligent narrative is the incredible computer graphics of early critters, from the humongous to the itty bitty.  It is all so well done and downright captivating that it held my attention non-stop.
