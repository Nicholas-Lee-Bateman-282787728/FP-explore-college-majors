8316248,3,B001KVZGJI,"My family has had the book A Small Miracle by Peter Collington for a few years and we love to reverence that each picture brings.  This DVD is a cute story, but does not have the same reverence and sweet Christmas Spirit that the book has.  It does not follow the book, they have added a lot that I think detracts from the story and takes away the simplistic message about the true meaning of Christmas.",1384387200,,403,4.2894736842105265

First it is wonderful that the aurthor can spread such a beautiful lesson to all of us without words.  Its like what St. Francis said ""preach the gospel and use words only when needed"".
I cried every time I looked at this book and studied each picture more carefully and with a deep sense of the wonder of God taking care of our needs not our wants and how happy one can be with so little.",1243296000,9,495,4.040816326530612
8316251,5,B001KVZGJI,"This is a quiet, gentle, musical Christmas story which can be enjoyed by toddlers and adults alike.  A poor gypsy street musician playing her old accordion to make ends meet at Christmas time is ignored by the busy shopping crowds.  She has no resort but to pawn her beloved old instrument.  Then she is the victim of a cruel theft.  Ah, but Mary, Joseph, and the Wise Men have all benefitted from her kindness that very Christmas Eve and they take matters into their own hands.  There is no dialogue, only the gentle music and the lovely drawings that move.",1231372800,8,558,4.54
