8245541,3,B0012DT20S,"This is a travelogue film which shows overviews of some interesting areas in Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam.  It is not an analytical look but is interesting to see visually these sites in the country.",1474675200,,201,4.911764705882353
8245542,4,B0012DT20S,Good documentary,1469318400,,16,7.5
8245543,3,B0012DT20S,Avg. travel log. Too much time in Thailand and not enough in Vietnam,1411084800,,68,4.3076923076923075
8245544,4,B0012DT20S,"A beautifully done travelogue with stunning visuals. The camera takes the viewer  through the best of three countries in Southeast Asia, featuring gorgeous nature, stunning temples, and archaeological sights. I was pleasantly surprised by some portions, particularly how lovely and peaceful Ho Chi Minh City seems to be. If you need a mini vacation but are too tired to leave the comfort of the sofa, or if you are curious and/or anticipating a trip to the area,  I would recommend it.",1409097600,,485,4.9753086419753085
8245545,5,B0012DT20S,Very informative and great photo footage.  Worth watching.  Learned a lot about all three countries by watching this.  Would recommend to anyone.,1360454400,,145,5.5
8245546,2,B0012DT20S,"This travelogue is a very general overview and is actually misleading in its title as it focusses hardly at all on the actual river Mekong and instead just uses it as a tag for the lead into segments on the temples of Siem Reap in Cambodia ( nowhere near the Mekong- and  not 35 kms from Phnom Penh either, as the commentary asserts), the cities of Bangkok and Lopburi in Thailand ( again, not near the Mekong)and the cities of Hanoi, Hue and Hoi Ahn in Vietnam, although we do get a bit of the Mekong here with a quick trip down the delta.
It's only for people who are obsessed with collecting any footage of cambodia or theseother countries. It's not really worth much in any other area.",1207180800,5,689,4.341085271317829
