4661326,5,B005DOSCCQ,"This classic spaghetti western finally gets a US release. Starring three spaghetti legends, Volonte, Milian and William Berger - Directed by the great Sergio Sollima with an incredible score by the legendary Ennio Morricone.",1436140800,10,224,5.617647058823529
4661327,1,B005DOSCCQ,Hold it one minute. The 93 minute version is the cut version. This should be the 107 minute director's cut. I own the 107 minute Japanese version AND it has been released uncut in Europe. Can Kino-Lorber clarify which version this is?,1435363200,14,234,4.595238095238095
4661328,5,B005DOSCCQ,"""What's extraordinary is that a man like me has been a spectator for so many years before discovering the force within. Do you know what an intelligent man can do in a place like this where the most ignorant have been able to dominate?""

Perhaps more than any other western, Faccia a Faccia/Face to Face confronts the nature and morality of violence head on. Gian Maria Volonte plays an underachieving unambitious and consumptive Professor of History who goes west for his health. Kidnapped by Tomas Milian's uneducated killer, he finds himself being drawn away from being a spectator to become a willing participant in his violence. Soon he takes a more dominant role, planning their raids and then, when the remainder of the gang are either killed or captured, rejecting them for their weakness and turning the commune of losers where they hide out into a doomed dictatorship.

The principal characters are mere bandits rather than revolutionaries, pursuing no political agenda, yet the political content is much more overt than in better known political paella westerns like Damiano Damiani's A Bullet for the General. It is certainly the better directed film, with a good visual sense that runs through the entire film rather than in sporadic scenes. There are still some of the usual paella western problems (some, such as the clumsiness with the passage of time, down to cuts when the film was trimmed for the US market, are redressed in the uncut version) but the film is clearly thought through and superbly realised.

The equation of intellect and violence is made from the very beginning, where Volonte crumples up the pages of a book to throw at a lizard to wile away his boredom. At first he's confused, unable to distinguish between the rules of survival and overriding instinct, and when he adapts to his environment he goes to extremes because of the weakness of character that makes him the most civilized of men among civilized company and the most violent in violent company. His actions are more abhorrent than Milian's for the reasoning behind them. As he points out, they both do the same things ""but with a difference. I know what I'm doing."" It is his cold calculation that finally gives the bandit's instinctive violence and the Pinkerton agent who betrays him a sense of moral superiority.

Unfortunately, his growing megalomania is interrupted by the intervention of an army of vigilantes who are not too particular about who they kill, leaving some of the film's potential untapped, but it is never a disappointment. Indeed, it is full of striking and memorable moments. Two rival bosses greet each other civilly and sit down to watch their respective hired guns battle it out in the street below; a robber compliments the Pinkerton man on his shooting as he dies; Volonte discusses the philosophy of violence with the 'intellectual equal' he is torturing - ""One violent soul is just an outlaw.. but violence by masses of men is called history.""

Volonte, as the Kevin Kline-ish academic who adapts to his violent surroundings like a moral chameleon, and Milian as the gradually more disconcerted bandit are both superb in their very different styles of performance (the two actors apparently took an instant dislike to each other that Sollima exploited for dramatic effect), giving considerably more layered and subtle performances than is the norm for the genre even if Volonte does rather overplay the professor's timidity in his early scenes. Ennio Morricone's fractured, tormented score, while far from his most melodic, is easily one of his best and compliments both the film's ideas and images admirably. Both engrossing and entertaining, Faccia a Faccia is one of the very best westerns of the sixties and one that never lets its audience suffer for its considerable intelligence and ambition.

It's certainly a departure from Sollima's previous film with Milian, The Big Gundown, with its studio imposed happy ending, or their subsequent treasure hunt capers in Run Man Run. In many ways it's the kind of film that could only have come from a country trying to come to terms with how so many intelligent people not only supported and intellectually justified its fascist dictatorship but willingly joined in with its crimes as well. Although co-writer Sergio Donati felt the script over-emphatic, it's a remarkably economic affair, packing a lot into many of its scenes - emotional beats as much as ideas - without ever letting them seem overloaded or interrupting the natural flow of the story or the character development.

The English-language version was cut for US release, but thankfully Eureka's much delayed UK PAL DVD is the uncut Italian-language version running 16 minutes longer in its original ratio. The additions are surprisingly substantial - particularly a long scene where Volante, overplaying the timidity, is unable to cut the bullet out of Milian's wound, so the bandit does it himself; a telling sequence where Volante is able to shoot at targets but not a live rabbit; an attempted seduction; the Pinkerton man buying his way into the gang by killing a sheriff; Brad cheering up an old outlaw he later mistreats; the authorities discussing how Brad has become worse than his mentor; and Bennett getting him into a gunfight to see if he really has the killer instinct.

There's also a 16-minute interview with Sollima, the Italian trailer (minus captions) and, in much poorer quality, the American trailer as well as a 16-page booklet. The picture quality is certainly the best it's ever looked on home video, though like many Techniscope films you'll notice the limitations of the source material if you watch it on too big a screen (the `poor man's CinemaScope,' Techniscope used only half of a 35mm frame for its widescreen image, with a noticeable reduction in quality). All in all a forgotten Italian western well worth remembering.",1374796800,4,5895,5.020449897750511
4661329,4,B005DOSCCQ,"The film was most worthwhile though not as good as Sollima's La Resa Dei Conti. The performances are excellent, however the star of the show is the music by Ennio Morricone.",1366502400,2,173,4.612903225806452

8467254,4,B005DOSCCQ,"Here is the third Western directed by Sergio Sollima and starring the great Tomas Milian  'FACE TO FACE' aka 'FACCIA A FACCIA'- 1967  and Kino Lorber gives it the release it finally deserves.  Released in the States in a truncated version, we are able to see the full length Italian Version for the first time so you can throw out your inferior transfers .  The epic story of Professor Fletcher played against type by Gian Maria Volonte who graced two of Director Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy and Beauregard Bennet  can be appreciated .  Knowing that he faces a death sentence health wise, Fletcher leaves his New England scholastic halls for the Texas desert  and gets more than he bargained for.  As the hostage of bandit Bennet, his timid way of thinking reverts to his suppressed violent urges and both men become totally different beings by the films climax.  Along for the ride are William Berger as the Pinkerton agent who is hounding Bennet and Mexican bandits played by Aldo Sambrell and Nello Pazzafini.  Sollima keeps the film flowing in a slow pace where you are able to appreciate the characters and the beautiful images of cameraman Raphael Pacheco.  The soaring score by the great Ennio Morricone abets the proceedings as well.  The film, however, belongs to Tomas Milian who always gives a great performance as he slowly changes under the influence of Fletcher.  It is highly recommended for all Euro Western fans.  Kino releases both versions of the film with the Italian version suffering from slightly faded color tinting although the Italian track is crystal clear with correctly translated English sub titles.  A trailer for Kino's Blu-Ray release of Director Sergio Corbucci's excellent 'NAVAJO JOE' aka 'UN DOLLARO A TESTA'- 1966 is the only extra.",1494028800,2,1773,4.96271186440678

8467258,4,B005DOSCCQ,"Interesting, if ultimately predictable story, where the rough gang leader and intellectual trade places psychologically based on events and the influence of each other.

8467259,4,B005DOSCCQ,Gian Maria Volonte plays Brad Fletcher a college professor from Boston who is forced into retirement because of bad health and has to move out west. One day he is taken hostage by bandit Solomon Bennet(Tomas Milian) and the 2 form a strange bond. The men are pursued by a bounty hunter played  by William Berger. The plot is very interesting. In fact i think i liked it better than Sergio Sollima's other film The Big Down. The movie looks beautiful on bluray but the american version of the movie is the only one in high def. The uncut italian version is standard and looks like a grainy vhs. It was great to see Gian Maria Volonte playing a character other than a Mexican bandit. His performance in this picture was particularly good. The only extras are a trailer for Burt Reynolds Navajo Joe . But i'm still glad i bought it because it's very good movie.,1452038400,3,858,4.464968152866242
