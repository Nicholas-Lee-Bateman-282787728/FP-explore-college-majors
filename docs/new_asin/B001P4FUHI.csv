8332108,5,B001P4FUHI,"I would recommend viewing this Genesis Project to every deep believer and Bible reader, Ive watched it over and over for years; this is an authentic and unadulterated recount of the Bible. Unfortunately the series were discontinued; the narrator was brilliant and actors in Hebrew made exceptional, it helps understand the five first book of the Bible.
If it could be available in DVD version that will be great. Please do not change anything to it",1433289600,,448,4.907894736842105
8332109,5,B001P4FUHI,"This is the BEST depiction of Isaac, Jacob and Esau I have ever seen.  The New Media Bible videos faithfully follow a narration from the King James Version.  No Hollywood malarkey!

In the background, you can hear the actors speak in the same language families as those they portray.

I believe that the reason that these videos are so hard to find (e.g., the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the Mormons, decided to stop distributing these, probably because they showed how superior to their own scriptures the Biblical record is) is that the ""Powers that Be"" see how respectful of and faithful to the Biblical text these videos are.",1234396800,3,646,4.792792792792793
