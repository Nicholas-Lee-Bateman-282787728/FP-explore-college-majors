1959042,3,B0000YEDOK,"This is a double-feature DVD containing the films The Ghastly Ones and Seeds of Sin. The Ghastly Ones takes place in a rotting old mansion. People get butchered by some ugly ass lunatics. Seeds of Sin is some type of family reunion where people get electrocuted, strangled, and poisoned.

I didn't enjoy this Something Weird release as much as some of their others. I generally enjoy low/no-budget retro drive-in type movies, but I just couldn't really get into these. The inserted ""sex"" scenes in Seed of Sin is a bit absurd. The new girl's body is completely different from the original's. At least make sure they are similar.

As usual, Something Weird Video has done an admirable job of including a bunch of extra materials. There is an unfinished trailer(4 1/2 mins) as well as a 16mm workprint(40min) for Seeds of Sin. These contain some deleted scenes. There's a commentary track for The Ghastly Ones as well as a Gallery of Art from Milligan.

Additionally, there are 6 trailers including The Ghastly Ones, The Body Beneath, Guru the Mad Monk, The Rats are Coming!, The Werewolves are Here, and Vapors(an early homosexual themed movie). Trailers are fun to watch. Weird voice and spooky music. Lastly, there's an insert with a long bio of Andy Milligan.",1286323200,2,1261,4.855813953488372

1959044,5,B0000YEDOK,"Most people talk about the great ANDY MILLIGAN as if he was just a funny hack and that pisses me off. The man was a true genius, period.
So bad it's  so good ? Are you blind, unsensitive SOB's kidding me ? If loving movies like SEEDS OF SIN is wrong, then believe me, I don't wanna be right. That insane piece of Cinema History left a print on my mind that will stay forever. I can only think of very few movies ( the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is among them ) that portrayed a disfonctional family so effectively. Pure hysteria on film, that's what SEEDS OF SIN is.
It is known that ANDY has been mistreated and abused by his mom as a child, and if you can feel it in most of his movies, it's crystal clear when you've watched this one. Abusive, unstable mom,hateful children driven to insanity and murder, deviant sex scenes, cheap but vicious Gore FX... that's what's on the menu. And don't forget the raw B&W photography, the weird angles and of course the actors giving all they got. You call that a scholkfest ? I call that the work of an auteur, yes sir.
I want to thank SOMETHING WEIRD for bringing us masterpieces like that. Those guys are saints in my book and ANDY MILLIGAN is one of our prophets. Those who think I'm joking can get the middle finger and the others... Well, you know what to do.",1164499200,3,1312,4.290322580645161
1959045,1,B0000YEDOK,"These films are appauling. I can't understand why Andy Milligan has such a cult following, he is a total and utter hack. Sure, nobody watches a movie called ""The Ghastly Ones"" expecting high art, but these films aren't even entertaining. I love low-brow films as much as the next guy, but there is good bad (i.e. the films of Roger Corman, Llyod Kaufman, Herschell Gordon Lewis etc) and then there is just plain bad. These films fall into the latter category. Milligan doesn't even understand basic cinematography (axis of camera etc).

I'm not the kind of guy who gets his jollies writing scathing cynical reviews (you can check!), but after seeing all the four and five star ratings I felt compelled to be the voice of reason. For the love of god, SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.",1146787200,3,789,4.635714285714286
1959046,4,B0000YEDOK,"You'll either love or hate these no-budget movies, in fact you should already know if it's something you like or not.  The ""If you're an Andy Milligan fan"" review is really good, except for the fact that there are other Milligan movies available on DVD besides the three mentioned.

They come in 2-DVD sets on the Video Kart label.  Bloodthirsty Butchers comes with the dreadfully painful The Rats are Coming! The Werewolves are Here!  Graverobbers, a funny and twisted movie, is actually directed by Milligan collaborator Straw Weisman, who also wrote the exploitation classic Fight For Your Life.  Graverobbers is packaged together with Monstrosity, for those who've never seen Andy's work from the 1980's.  Apparently there's some tampering with the movie on Bloodthirsty Butchers, as far as inserting some unnecessary slow-motion footage.  Also there's some debate on whether these movies are completely uncut.  Just wanted to let all the weirdos out there know that these films have also made the jump to DVD.  Stay sick.",1112832000,3,1026,5.16969696969697
1959047,5,B0000YEDOK,"Welcome back, kids, to this Saturday's double-feature from the Something Weird series. I chose ""The Ghastly Ones"" and ""Seeds of Sin"" entirely at random only figuring it was another combination of a cheap horror film and a sexploitation flick from the old days only to discover that both films are the work of director Andy Milligan (1924-1991). Early today I would have said that all I knew about Milligan as a cult auteur was that he was out there in the realm of underground films somewhere between Ed Wood and Russ Meyer pointed in the direction of Roger Corman. I had also heard of Michael Weldon's choice riposte from ""The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film"" where he declared, ""If you're an Andy Milligan fan, there's no hope for you."" These two films provide all the evidence you would ever need to conform Weldon's hypothesis.

Milligan made 29 movies between 1965 and 1968, consisting mainly of gory horror films dressed up as period pieces, such as ""Bloodthirsty Butchers"" and ""The Rats Are Coming! The Werewolves Are Here!"", and sex melodramas with rampant nudity, including ""Gutter Trash"" and ""Fleshpot on 42nd Street"" as part of NYC's ""grindhouse"" cinema (most of the theaters were on 42nd Street). Milligan shot most of his films with a hand held 16mm movie camera on extremely cheap budgets. What usually happened then was the films were blown up to 35mm size and shown in and around New York ""art"" theaters. Today there are only three of Milligan's films available on DVD and here are two of them (the third is ""The Body Beneath""). Something Weird has apparently included every trailer they could find for a Milligan opus (even if they do not have sound).

""The Ghastly Ones"" (a.k.a. ""Blood Rites""), Milligan's first horror film, is a 1968 film shot in ""cranium-cleaving color"" at his Victorian mansion on Staten Island. After a prologue in which a couple with a really large umbrella are hacked up by some guy, this movie has three daughters and their husbands at a reading of their late father's will. It is his wish that the couples spend three days in the family mansion ""in sexual harmony,"" and then they will find out who gets what from the old man. But once there the handyman is eating live rabbits, the couples start fighting, and then people start dying and showing up as the main course at dinner.

It takes a long time to get to anything remotely close to the required sexual harmony and even longer for characters to start dropping, but once they do, they start dropping like flies. But by then you might be asleep. It has been a long time since I have seen a horror film where nothing happens for such a long time. But if you are loose for a high content of cheese with your blood and gore, you will not be disappointed. This film comes with a spirited discussion between actor Hal Borske, who plays Colin the guy who eats the rabbit, and Frank Henenlotter, the director of ""Basket Case."" In addition to insights into Milligan's work both interesting and irreverent, they discuss Da Vinci writing backwards and other unexpected choice topics. The first two-thirds of the film is a two, the last third a four, and the commentary a five. Do your own math.

""Seeds of Sin"" (originally released as ""Seeds"") was also shot in 1968, at the same location, and offers a similar plot wherein a family reunion ends up with everybody dead (the end). Claris Manning (Maggie Rogers) is a wretched old invalid whose daughter Carol (Candy Hammond) decides to invite the rest of her siblings home for the holiday. But since there is an inheritance to be had when the old lady dies, the list of possible benefactors needs to be trimmed. Because this film is shot in black & white there is not as much gore, and I should also point out that the film ponders the question, if you are contemplating suicide and a door opens driving a sharp instrument into your heart, were you murdered? Discuss amongst yourselves.

Like ""The Ghastly Ones,"" this film opens with a scene that has nothing to do with the rest of the film involving an orgy. The difference is that this prologue was clearly shot by someone other than Milligan with different actors. In other words, this is the ""producer's cut"" of ""Seeds of Sin,"" because the producers decided to take sex scenes and insert them in between (and sometimes during) the scenes Milligan shot. It is really easy to tell the inserted stuff, because the music suddenly becomes most drums and some guitar. This is X-rated material (not XXX-rated material) and watching this film takes me back to watching late night horror shows, except that instead of commercials suddenly popping up at the wrong times we have Sixties style porn. It also has me wondering when was the last time I saw such serious tan lines in a movie.

Fortunately the people at Something Weird uncovered the first and third reels of the original 16mm footage Milligan shot. Some of it does not have sound, but the 40 minutes of that are twice as good as the finished movie, which is twice as long. But in its edited form ""Seeds of Sin"" is a true cinematic car wreck, by which I mean you cannot take your eyes off of it as Milligan's story get interrupted for the sex scenes. From the original footage and the unfinished trailer included on the DVD, you can get some idea as to what was cut to make room for the sex scenes (apparently they did some cutting before the insertions). There might not be a Doctoral dissertation in reconstructing the original ""Seeds of Sin,"" but you could probably get a decent Master's thesis out of it. Both versions of the film merit four stars for decidedly different reasons.

All of the extras are found in ""Andy's Closet,"" which includes the above mentioned footage, the extant trailers of the Andy Milligan oeuvre, and as is to case to date with these double-feature CDs from Something Weird earn five stars (or higher for the unrepentant fans of Milligan). Be aware that the copies of both films have some significant problems, with ""The Ghastly Ones"" being all scratched up and the original parts of ""Seeds of Sin"" having major sound problems (subtitles would have been nice). So, that would be three stars for the first feature, four stars for the second, plus five for the extras, which adds up to twelve, divided by two is six, which is one more than five, so we round down because this DVD is a celebration of a true giant of sexploitation and horror. Be sure to join us next Saturday night, when we have ""Bloodlust"" and ""Atom Age Vampire"" on the midnight menu.",1109980800,20,6519,4.668407310704961
1959048,4,B0000YEDOK,"The audio commentary by Milligan regular Haal (the extra A is for awesome!) Borske on ""The Ghastly Ones"" is one of the most hysterically funny yet heartbreakingly rueful accounts of a life in low-budget films I've ever heard. Borske has a lot of nice things to say about his old pal Andy, but he's also got a LOT to complain about (particuarly being set on fire by the director). As another reviewer mentioned, you've really got to develop a taste for these films, but they can be very rewarding. Milligan was a true auteur, doing everything on his films from the camerawork to the costumes, but he did none of it well. The thing was, he was so driven to tell his insane stories that somehow it all came together. Milligan films are unmistakable and you'll never forget watching them. The two on this disc are some of the most unforgettable.",1094688000,8,841,4.576158940397351
8004516,1,B0000YEDOK,"The bottom of the exploitation barrel. Both films have very little going for them in the  exploitation of gore and sex. Both films are pretty boring in fact.  I was led to believe that The Gastley Ones was suppose to be one of the gorest and shocking grindhouse flicks ever made...WRONG-O! Just your run of the mill slasher flick.
The second film, Seeds Of Sin,  was nothing more then woman running around nude and the sex scenes were pretty tame. Im not sure there was even a real plot to this one. Seemed jumbled and messy.
Whats really bothersome is all the 5 and 4 stars review on here. People saying ""you have to have a taste for these kind of films"".
 Well, I have a taste for these type of films and have seen many types of low-budget grindhouse exploitation films over the years and believe me, these don't even come close to being anything but crap.",1499904000,,858,4.4113924050632916

8004518,4,B0000YEDOK,"Andy Milligan films are exercises in human awfulness and this is no exception. I don't mean that as a knock. It's a plus. I tried to stay away from his movies for a long time after seeing one cause I knew it'd be a rabbit hole but I've embraced it along with bad camera work, homosexual male actors being visually appalled at the thought of kissing an actress, and period films clearly being filmed in a campy town home in Greenwich Village in 70s NY.

You get 2 films here. The Ghastly Ones is a solid period piece horror film where 3 siblings and their spouses have to live in a house in ""sexual harmony"" to get their inheritance. It can only lead to murder. It does. It's humorous. It's genuinely creepy and has some unnerving sexual politics. It's a film where male homosexuals are being preyed on by dominant scheming women. It's undercover save for a few lines but it's the subtext.

Seeds of Sin is sad once you know about Milligan's life. It's Milligan working out years of sexual and familial frustration in a film about a bunch of incestuous, murderous lunatics. It's also the more graphic of the films starting out on a surprisingly graphic orgy that would feel at home on Game of Thrones in terms of content and gay to straight variety. It's also punished wildly as if Milligan can't stop his own self loathing for a second.

It's a cheap DVD filled with great extras and a clean transfer. Worth the pennies.",1467331200,,1420,4.496124031007752

8004520,1,B0000YEDOK,"If you are a lover of bad movies, this one may be for you. The film opens with a man with a hunchback killing two people on a private island. We then focus on three sisters and their spouses who are read a will by an old man who has no idea that you can trim facial hair such as eyebrows and long nose hairs. Vicky (Anne Linden) doesn't razor under her arms either. Anyway as part of an odd inheritance the three couples must spend time in a house on the same island where a hunchback is the caretaker. To no surprise there is a series of murders.

The film has not been restored. The acting was bad. The best character was the Richie's brother who had money and ""abnormal tastes.""  He was stereotypical gay. He had the best line as he said to his brother's wife Vicky, ""I didn't think you were good enough for him. I'm sure you'll prove me wrong yet.""  She smiles and be-bops off.

Had a very bad scene of wife rape.

8004522,5,B0000YEDOK,"It takes a certain type of person to enjoy the films of Andy Milligan and I am one of those people. Milligan was a complex person in a world all his own and you have to listen to his dialogue to realize that, not only was he gay, he had an extreme dislike for the Catholic church, mainly because they never accepted the gay lifestyle choice as an legitimate one. THE GHASTLY ONES is mainly looked upon as a ""reading of the will while the relatives get knocked-off one-by-one"" scenario but there is a lot here to read between the lines. A lot of people find his handheld camerawork (which he did himself) and plentiful dialogue hard to get through, but once you know the man (read the biography ""THE GHASTLY ONES: THE SEX GORE NETHERWORLD OF ANDY MILLIGAN"" to get to know his sordid life), you will begin to look at his films in a different light. This was one of Milligan's first horror films and it covers all the trademarks he would show in his later films (pitchfork to the stomach, meat cleaver to the head, swirling camerawork). He later remade this film in 1978 as LEGACY OF HORROR, but this first one is still the best. Like I said, it takes a special person to enjoy Milligan's films, and if you are that type of person, this disc is the perfect starting point.",1422057600,3,1269,4.38135593220339
8004523,5,B0000YEDOK,"I am very biased about the work of Andy Milligan.  After reading all the horrible reviews of his work, I just had to see his work & this was the first one that turned up in a local rental store where I shopped as a teenager.  The Ghastly Ones is a good one to start with as his cinematic trademarks are in abundance, & it's one of his more gruesome & better-paced works.  The low budget aspects work for the film, in my opinion, and make his films so unique & instantly identifiable (I stole that opinion from Michael Weldon, but it's very true!)  Be careful if you try to show an unsuspecting viewer a Milligan film; my girlfriend was in the next room as I watched this & asked me if it was a film from the 40's.

8004525,2,B0000YEDOK,"The Ghastly ones is an extremely dark claustrophobic close up shakey cam amateurish movie, the dialog and acting are drivel, but the basic story line is ok, this film is extremely difficult to get through, and only the most die hard something weird fans will enjoy this, I'm finding more and more I need to be more selective about the SWV flicks I pick up, after really enjoying the first few SWV's I bought, I started collecting and buying all things something weird, but as it turns out this is a ghastly idea, because Mike Vraney has zero discrimination as to what he puts out, if it's on 16mm and not 100% degridated, its the lasted release, no mater how unwatchable stupid or amateurish it is, the second film  Seeds of Sin is 84mins of B&W boobs with some bad acting thrown in, much better than the first film, but more shaky camera work combined with a super shaky transfer, makes it headache inducing as well, my screen still hasn't stopped shaking up and down after trying to watch these films.
