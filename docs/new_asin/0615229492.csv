7800464,2,0615229492,"If you love choral music or have ever been part of a ""glee club"", you will be disappointed in this DVD.  While it is an rather interesting ""documentary"", it is extremely short on performance.  The sound is awful.  The few performances are not well recorded or filmed.  The impression this reviewer has is that The Mendelssohn Glee Club is a group of amateurs who like to get together and sing.  That is laudable, but not worth the hype of this DVD.  The very association with the name, Mendelssohn, is most misleading.  That the group has been in existence for over 150 years is not brought out by the examples presented.  At the very beginning of the disc, when you are given the ""menu"", the Broadway show type of singing is a real off-putting introduction.  Personally, I can't stand that kind of sound.  It is unfortunate that this group was not given the exposure they (perhaps) deserve.  The few very short examples of real singing are interrupted by unnecessary conversation or commentary by individuals that have little to say of value, other than declaring their enjoyment in being part of the ""club"".  Basically, I would not want to fault the organization, which, I suspect, is a fine one, but this DVD certainly does NOT do them justice.  This is a ""vanity"" production, similar to books of bad poetry and boring memoirs.",1298073600,,1330,4.730434782608696
7800465,5,0615229492,"This documentary just won't let you go. The human interest is interesting and the music is lovely -- but what a knockout historical punch! The Mendelssohn was the first of all glee clubs in America and for over a century the hottest ticket in town. Few people today realize what it was like back when when amateur performances not only dominated social life, but the amateur musicians had to be good. Thus the material from the Club's archives is quite eye-opening, and the disc comes with a very readable historical brochure as well (does anyone know that in 1912 the club gave the first transcontinental telephone concert?). The amateur spirit lives on - the good-natured, comradely atmosphere in which the members rehearse and perform is such a contrast with the high pressure in ""popular"" (professional) music that you just want to go down to the church bazement and hang out with the guys on rehearsal nights. This DVD is both entertaining, with good music, and highly informative about musical history in America.",1235001600,,1019,4.930232558139535
