8279220,4,B001ARDC0C,"There are so many people confused by Artefacts (""Artifacts"" in the U.S) ... frankly, I'm confused why everyone is so confused! If you just pay attention, and give the attention this film requires, you'll understand plenty. Just because it has an open ending, that doesn't mean answers weren't given.

Kate is a career gal that seems to have things going for her, except for a failed relationship. All of a sudden her employee and friends start turning up dead, killed by doppelgangers. Even the news reports mention a strange metallic artifact (spelled artefact in the film, due to its Belgian production I assume) that has been found inside each victim. Kate finds that her own doppelganger is hunting her down, and the implant is possibly a tracking device for the doppelgangers to find each victim. The arrival of each doppelganger is preceded by a clicking, ticking sound as well. Through investigation on the internet she finds a big clue to what is going on around the world, and she is just another pawn in the whole thing.

She then meets up with a man named Carl Francken who reveals just enough for us to know some of the ""why"" of the situation but only just a tidbit to keep us in the dark and still trying to figure things out. In a way this would have made a great X-Files episode, much of the atmosphere and story fit that well. I'm also very much reminded of the wonderful 2008 feature ""The Broken"" with Lena Headey (which equally baffled many U.S. viewers but, if paid close attention to, gave more answers to its mystery than Artefacts does). There is also an ""experiment/game"" element that reminded me of the 2005 film ""Experiment."" However, Artefacts is a story and film of its own, and I feel holds up well.

These days, particularly in U.S. audiences, people want easy answers and wrapped up solutions in their movies. If they have to think while watching a film or try to think some more after the credits roll, they get angry. I've read some very severely hateful things in comments online about Artefacts, The Broken, Session 9, and a good example -- the 2001 film The Wind, where people just didn't get it. They were upset that they had to think, figure things out, and put the puzzle together. They weren't easily handed blood and boobs on a platter; just angry that they had to do a little work as well as sit back and watch.

Artefacts, to me as well as some open-minded friends, turned out to be a tense well-made, well-acted thriller, and smartly made on a low budget (only $100,000) with an intriguing premise and execution. I love to view it with friends as a double-feature with The Broken, as each has its own strange world to absorb and mess with your head. Some folks may say it's a European thing, but I sure welcome a viewing challenge and for me it paid off quite well. Oh, it's just plain creepy too...",1491004800,,2842,4.577603143418467
8279221,3,B001ARDC0C,"This movie is the story of Kate, a young woman with her own company, a troubled relationship with her ex and otherwise a perfect life. One night she dreams that one of her friends get murdered, and when she the next day is called by the police about the murder, which really took place her nightmare begins. It seams that exact doubles of all of Kate's friends show up to murder them, Kate to have a evil twin hellbent on killing her.

Now this might sound like another pod people film, there have been allot of those mimicking Invasion of the Body Snatchers, however the copies here do not replace the originals, they just kill them. The plot is bizarre and no real answers are given in the end, however strange as it is I was drawn to the plot non the less. Many movies which is left without a proper explanation feels unended, I feel cheated somewhat, but here I feel that I have gotten a complete story, even if the film leaves the viewer with more questions than answers.

Artifacts is a hard movie to review as it looks more like some amateur film project than something actually made by a studio. It is obvious that the film is made on the cheap, there is few effects and the picture quality is lower than that of a VHS, meaning it is a grainy mess. The acting is okey but it is not outstanding. However the music, and especially the sound the copies makes as they near their victims help very well to set the mood. I would say that with this film the people behind it have done allot with what little budget they got.

The movie is strange, it have more flaws than i can count, it lacks finesse in every aspect, but I think there was some love put into making this film. This is more a paranormal mystery film than horror as there is few scares, and I rather enjoyed it. I was pulled in by the mood of the film and enjoyed the 80 minutes or so it lasted. If you like a bit strange horror movies with little gore but a somewhat original plot then you might like this one, but know what you are getting, this is more your movie buff neighbor making a film with his buddies than Hollywood, but for what it is I think it is worth watching.",1295308800,,2143,4.234718826405868
8279222,1,B001ARDC0C,"I wish there were a system that would warn consumers if the DVD is a 'film' or a real movie. This is a film. It just ends with no answers. I had a lot of questions: Why didn't the things take the artifacts from the first bodies when they killed them? How did they make mechanical noises and why? Why did they chase their victims if they seemed to be able to teleport anywhere? If they had spirit-like bodies, why couldn't they go through walls and doors? What happened to the police investigation? What in the world was the point of this film? There are people around with pieces of metal implanted in them? There are clones trying to get people? I give it one star for the creepy mechanical sound I can now make to scare my wife.",1223424000,3,730,4.258992805755396
8279223,3,B001ARDC0C,"The female lead is running from the strange mechanical sound
that seems to be finding and killing her close friends and even her lover.
A chase and  doppelganger movie that seems to be about alien implants?
The acting isn't all bad, but the plot is really pretty strange.
No real answers here...",1221177600,3,295,4.673076923076923
8279224,4,B001ARDC0C,"I watch a lot of bad movies, and I expected this to be no different.  I was quite blown away.  The music is totally standout, the acting is pretty great (though it lags at times), and the story's progression is tense.  The story is pretty sparse, but I think that's by design, and I felt it worked well for the film.  The camera and lighting is pretty, um... indie, but the whole film's budget is just $100,000.  The audio work, on the other hand, is top notch.  It may not be the shiniest, most polished film ever, but it's creative and deftly told. I suggest it highly.",1220400000,3,571,4.289719626168225
8279225,1,B001ARDC0C,"Ridiculously bad movie.  Looks like it was shot with a camcorder, badly lit, grainy visuals, grotesquely amateurish acting, laughable fight sequences.  Save your money.

If you want to watch a GOOD movie about doppelgangers, try Invasion of the Body Snatchers.",1220054400,2,260,5.45
