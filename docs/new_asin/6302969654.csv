525061,5,6302969654,"I have seen many good reviews written about this excellent movie, but, unfortunately none of them mention McGregor. ""Who is McGregor?"" I hear you ask. McGregor is the little snake and the pet of the little boy Philippe, who is cruely killed by the evil Mrs Baines (McGregor, I mean, not Philippe).

As such, the little chap plays an vital role in preparing the way for the 'karmic reversal' that results in Mrs Baines' death and our willing acceptance of this deeply karmic act. Without McGregor the whole movie would grind to a halt.

Before his untimely death McGregor has his 'moment in the Sun' as he captivates us with his wriggling antics, eating cake, and snuggling down in his little cubby hole behind the loose brick. Some actors have got that mysterious, inexplicable 'X factor' and McGregor is definitely one of these.",1139702400,4,829,4.79020979020979

525064,5,6302969654,"Carol Reed was perhaps even more famous in his day for coaxing superb performances out of children than Steven Spielberg is today... and much of it is due to the astonishing performance in this marvelous film by Bobby Henrey as Phillipe, the son of the French Ambassador to the UK. Henrey delivers what must be one of the greatest child's performances ever on screen (right up there with little Victoire Thivisol in PONETTE). Phile idolizes the butler at the embassy, the sweet but very ordinary Baines (Ralph Richardson), and when his hero becomes accused of murder in the death of his wife young Phile becomes wrapped up in the police investigation. The film does a superb job switching back and forth from a child's to an adult's register--we see things both from Phile's limited child's point of view (and understand his inability to put things together given his naievete), and we also see from an adult perspective how his attempts to help his idol only make things worse and worse. The film is beautifully shot--the embassy itself is something of a marble and tile wonder--and Henrey's frantic need for attention and his jumpy manner (and endearing lisp: ""He PUTHED her..."") make him seem as real a small child as you can imagine.",1047081600,43,1237,4.839622641509434
525065,5,6302969654,"Carol Reed, one of Britain's most masterly directors, handled this gem with consummate grace.  This was Reed's final film prior to his masterpiece, ""The Third Man.""
What makes this film so rare is that it is seen through the eyes of a young boy, played by Bobby Hendry.  Most of the action takes place in a South London mansion in fashionable Chelsea, which serves as the French Embassy.  The youngster's parents are away in France when the wife of his hero, played by Ralph Richardson, slips and falls down the second floor staircase, plunging to her death.  Richardson, the Embassy's caretaker, was caught in a loveless marriage with a difficult woman.  He is having an affair with Michele Morgan at the time of his wife's death.
A young child's imagination goes to work.  Hendry imagines that Richardson actually killed his wife and, when investigating police officers Jack Hawkins and Bernard Lee arrive, he engages in conduct in which, while seeking to help his hero Richardson, mistakenly implicates him.
By the film's conclusion Richardson is finally cleared, but Hendry's activities make things more difficult for him.  The imagination of a youngster seeking to help Richardson almost leads to his downfall.
Reed's deft handling of Hendry was reflective of his ability to work with children.  It was further demonstrated in ""A Kid for Two Farthings"" and in the brilliant musical ""Oliver!"", which resulted in an Academy Award for Reed.",1010880000,7,1442,5.0548523206751055

525087,3,6302969654,""" Oh what tangled webs we weave, when we first practice to deceive,"" or words to that effect are what drive this 1948 film noir based on a story by Graham Greene and directed by Carol Reed (most classically show-cased in the film noir world in the thriller starring Orson  Welles as Harry Lyme, The Third Man). Although this is not one of Greene's first-rate story lines the black and white film techniques used by Reed (although to better effect in The Third Man) highlight his almost claustrophobic and tight film style and demonstrate as well why he was nominated for an Oscar for this work.

As for the story line itself, well, the story is as old as Adam and Eve, maybe older. A guy (Ralph Richardson), a very married guy, working his dull little life away as an English butler (always suspense that job classification automatically of nefarious stuff right off the bat otherwise you will wind out following false leads, okay) in the French embassy in post-war (World War II to keep the wars straight) London has caught the attention of the ambassador's precocious (and bratty) young son who seems organically incapable of telling the truth when he is cornered. In order to keep him in thrall said butler has, well, made up a false persona about his previous life, a life of African adventure, intrigue, and mayhem. Harmless stuff really, until the hammer comes down.

And that is where our butler's being married, being very married, to one of the great crones of the ages, something out a witches' Sabbath (and I am being kind) who works in the embassy as the nanny to that precocious young son comes in. See said crone winds up very mysteriously dead and the fingers begin to point at the butler. Oh, I forgot to tell you, said butler, said unhappy butler had been, ah, playing footsies (hell, having an adulterous affair) with one of the embassy typists, and wifey gotten wise, hysterically wise. Along the way the boy, the butler, anybody with any knowledge about anything, come around the police to confuse the issue. But all things work on in the end, even for chronic liars, at least in this film. As you can now see not strong on the plot line but strong on the direction.",1355011200,,2186,4.628865979381444

525101,3,6302969654,"""FALLEN IDOL,"" (1948).  This black and white, 95 minute British thriller is the second of the collaborations of Graham Greene, noted author/screenwriter, and director Sir Carol Reed, the other two being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Third-Man-Blu-ray/dp/B003ULW74S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Third Man [Blu-ray</a>], and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Our-Man-in-Havana/dp/B001LMAK6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Our Man in Havana</a>.  Here, Greene wrote the screen adaptation of his own story, THE BASEMENT ROOM.  The picture makes for interesting comparisons with the pair's THIRD MAN.

In FALLEN IDOL, Philippe (Bobby Henrey), a diplomat's 7 or 8 year old son, worships the household butler at London's French embassy, Baines (Ralph Richardson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-White-Countess/dp/B000ERVJQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The White Countess</a>), who's regaled the boy with tales of his life's adventures. So, when Baines becomes implicated in a possible murder -- his shrewish wife has fallen to her death --Philippe will stop at nothing to protect his idol. This despite his own suspicions about the servant's guilt.  Screenwriter's and director's reflections on moral ambiguity were well-received at the film's release in 1948, and earned Reed an Oscar nod for Best Director, and Greene one for best screen adaptation.  Other notables in the cast include the beautiful French Michele Morgan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Port-of-Shadows-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00026L74U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Port of Shadows (The Criterion Collection)</a>) as Julie, Baines' love interest, and Dandy Nichols.  Jack Hawkins and Bernard Lee do well as investigating cops.

Graham Greene (1904-1991) was one of the most illustrious British writers of the 20th century. He enjoyed a very long life, most of the century, and a very long, prolific writing career.  I've read somewhere that 56% of Greene's works were made into notable films. The writer was also one of the better-known Catholic converts of his time; many of his thrillers, as this one, deal with Catholic themes of guilt and redemption. He created vivid characters with internal lives on the most fraught of the world's stages; his characters faced struggles and doubt. Sometimes his characters despaired, or suffered world-weary cynicism - they were always self-aware. But Greene always created a tight thriller, in a lean, realistic style that boasted almost cinematic visuals.

FALLEN IDOL is suspenseful, understated, and well-shot, giving us an accurate picture of London at the time.  It certainly can be compared to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, noted Anglo-American director of thrillers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0783225849/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho (Collector's Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-By-Northwest/dp/B002W7J3SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North By Northwest</a>).  Acting's good, though it's hard to believe Richardson and Morgan as a couple.  The picture boasts some excellent suspenseful scenes, such as the Baineses' fight at the head of the embassy staircase, or the flight through the embassy of a paper airplane made of a critical document.  The theme of a young child, usually foreign, left alone in a big house to be looked after by servants, has been a popular one in British fiction, going back at least as far as Charlotte Bronte's  JANE EYRE; Henry James also used it in THE TURN OF THE SCREW.  This doesn't seem to be a story that screamed for a movie version, but it's worth a look, though hardly a must.",1318896000,4,3833,6.636

A masterful little drama which glides expertly into a thriller in the third act, this 1948 film by Carol Reed tells the story of an impressionable young boy who sees an accidental death and thinks it was murder; with excellent black and white cinematography and a tension-filled third act, The Fallen Idol doesn't make many ""Best Films"" lists but if there was justice in the world, it would.

Baines is devoted to the boy and never tires of spending time with him, regaling him with tall tales that Philippe believes, of course.  One day, Baines asks Philippe to keep a big secret from the hateful Mrs. Baines and this secret eventually changes all of their lives.

This wonderful movie was made in 1948 and directed by Carol Reed.  Richardson is flawless and little Bobby Henrey gives one of the very best child performances ever.  He is completely natural, a real boy who dotes on his pet snake and would do anything for Baines, and acts in both English and French.  The story is a domestic drama turned homicide investigation and it kept me on the edge of my seat.  Heartily recommended.",1311033600,,879,4.705882352941177
525105,5,6302969654,"Having heard a lot of good things about it over the years, I only recently got to see ""The Fallen Idol"" when I finally purchased the DVD from amazon and I was both amazed and enthralled by it. Superbly directed by Carol Reed, it is a wonderfully acted; photographed and scripted adaptation of Graham Greene's short story, ""The Basement Room"". It takes place over a weekend at the French embassy in London, while both the ambassador and his wife are away. Their eight years old son, Phillipe (Bobby Henrey), is a lonely little boy with no friends of his own age to play with, who dotes on his small grass snake, MacGregor (at one point, holding a mirror in front of it and telling it ""Look, you're very pretty, you know."") and idolises the embassy butler, Baines (Ralph Richardson) who entertains the impressionable boy with stories of his past heroics in Africa, putting down a rebellion single handed and so on. Unbeknown to the boy at this stage, Baines has never been to Africa. Baines wife (Sonia Dresdel) whom Phillipe hates and is afraid of because she is very cruel to him, is the housekeeper with whom Baines is locked into an unhappy and fruitless marriage. Mrs Baines discovers that her husband is having an illicit love affair with Julie (Michele Morgan), a secretary at the embassy. She confronts her husband about this and Phillipe witnesses a violent row between them at the top of the stairs that seems to end in Baines pushing his wife down the stairs and murdering her. Phillipe, terrified, barefoot and dressed only in his pajamas, runs out in panic into the rain-soaked streets of night time London and is eventually confronted by a uniformed policeman patrolling his beat...!

Seen through the eyes of a child, but definitely not a kid's picture, the acting of all the cast is excellent. But, above all, we realise just how crucial eight years old Bobby Henrey was to Carol Reed's realisation of this film. Bobby had initially been chosen for the film both for his good looks after Reed had seen a photo of him peering out of the window of his London apartment on the dust jacket of one of his parents books and because he was bi-lingual, having been born in France and spending his childhood in both France and England and spoke English with a French accent, which was called for in the script. Bobby had never acted before, but this was just the kind of boy that Reed wanted. He didn't want a professional child actor who had picked up bad acting habits at stage school, he wanted a boy whom he could coax into giving a completely natural performance. He persevered with Bobby over a shooting schedule of an incredible eight months (a long time for those days), shooting numerous takes of the same scene and the same dialogue, which paid off handsomely, as he managed to coax out of the boy the most incredible and natural performance by a child actor ever seen on the screen and certainly not bettered since.

No better example of this can be found than in the scene where Phillipe, having told one lie after another to protect his beloved Baines, but only making things worse for his idol, is convinced that Baines is going to be sent to the gallows for a murder he did not commit. At this point, with all the passion in his heart and soul, Phillipe pleads with the police to listen to him as he finally decides to tell the truth about what happened in the desperate hope that this will save his friend. ""Oh, please, you must listen to me! I have something to tell you! It will only take a moment and it will make everything right! Oh, you must listen to me! Please, please, listen to me!"" But to his utter despair, the police completely ignore him. This scene is so gut-wrenchingly heart-breaking, that it's almost too upsetting to watch and you become totally involved in it and feel very deeply for this increasingly desperate little boy. It is an incredible performance that is so perfect, it has to be seen to be believed. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It is one of the finest films ever made in the history of the cinema.

There are two DVD's of the film available. The Criterion Region 1 release and the Optimum Releasing Region 2 release. Both use the same 35mm print as their source, which is of a beautifully restored version of the film and both feature at the beginning the original British Board of Film Censors ""A"" certificate (showing that the film has been passed for exhibition to Adult Audiences)from 1948. The Criterion release has an excellent booklet about Carol Reed and this film, as well as a couple of extras in the form of a 24 minute documentary about Reed and his films and a page by page look at the original press book. The Optimum DVD has no booklet and no extras. Picture and sound quality on both DVD's are excellent, considering that the film is now (in 2011) 63 years old.",1308355200,4,4845,4.579493087557604
525106,2,6302969654,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

For awhile, 'The Fallen Idol"" was part of the Criterion Collection but according to what I've read, the rights have now been acquired by Lionsgate. Be that as it may, any film that ends up as part of the Criterion Collection (even for a short while) is supposed to be considered a highly rated 'art' film, if not a 'masterpiece.' Certainly the film has things going for it including some wonderful noirish cinematography, Director Carol Reed's remarkable coaching job of a child actor, solid acting performances on the part of the adult actors and haunting on-location shots in 1948 London.

Despite the classy 'look' of the film, the screenplay itself is weak and as a result, I relegate the whole affair to the pantheon of 'B' melodrama. The weakest aspect of the film is obvious: the character of Mrs. Baines, who is just such a vapid, unlikeable martinet who would have been probably diagnosed as bipolar if she were alive today. And is Mr. Baines much better a character than the evil Mrs.? What exactly do we find out about the wily butler besides the back story that he killed a black man while he was living in Africa before working at the Embassy? As it turns out, that's just a tall tale Baines has made up to impress Phillipe. Otherwise, Baines spends most of his time trying to convince Phillipe to keep his mouth shut so that no one finds out about his affair with Julie, an Embassy employee who works in the steno pool.

I suppose it was very progressive of director Reed to hold up Baines and Julie as 'the good guys' despite the fact that they were having an affair (Reed himself was the product of an illegitimate union). But why should we hold them in such high esteem? Just because they're the victims of the unreasonable Mrs. Baines? I appreciate the fact that Baines wins points because he's kind to Phillipe but really that's all we know about him. And as far as Julie is concerned--to my mind, she's seems to be a complete empty vessel.

In watching the documentary about director Reed as part of the DVD 'supplement', we learn that he was master in extracting wonderful performances from the child actors he worked with during his long career. The case of Bobby Henrey who played Phillipe was no exception. Henrey reportedly could never sit still and eventually Reed had to hire a magician to perform tricks for the boy in order to keep his attention. Reed expertly brings out the child's confusion as he misunderstands the reason for Mrs. Baines' death which leads to Baines being placed in jeopardy (the child believes that Baines 'murdered' his wife after confusing that event with Baines' tall tale which initially the butler appeared to communicate as a 'murder' but later clarifying it as 'self defense').

The rest of ""Fallen Idol"" involves the rather stodgy police investigation into Mrs. Baines' death. Will the boy gum things up despite attempting to cover for the butler at every turn? Since he's just a kid, he's unable to cover up the discrepancies in Baines and Julies' story and after they're found out, Baines is on the verge of suicide. Fortunately an eagle eyed cop comes upon Mrs. Baines' footprint next to the window where she fell; this of course ends up exonerating the happy (or shall we say semi-happy) couple. I believe that the original ending from the book the film was based on, was Baines doing himself in, and some internet posters would prefer the more unpleasant denouement. I was actually pleased that the films' scenarists changed the ending to a happy one as the thought of having that child experience such an awful event as suicide would have ruined the picture for me.

If there is a moral in this story, it's probably 'always be honest' because Baines and Julies' decision not to tell the truth almost led to their arrest and complete downfall. Despite the fact they prevail in the end, I would have much preferred that Phillipe had a direct hand in saving them. As it turned out, it was pure coincidence that saved Baines from the hangman's noose and not little Phillipe who will only be remembered for not being able to keep his big mouth shut.

Like Hitchcock, The Fallen Idol is concerned with an innocent man being unjustly accused. Unlike Hitchcock, the characters of The Fallen Idol have little or no ambiguity. And when the protagonist is finally saved, it's not from his own exciting efforts or efforts on the part of a valuable ally (in this case, a nine year old boy) but from a slow-paced, pedestrian police investigation. Where was Hitchcock when you needed him?",1290384000,3,4580,4.710362047440699
525107,5,6302969654,"This film is my first exposure to the work of Graham Greene, and I must confess I'm very impressed. The story follows the life of the charming French Ambassador's son Phillip who has been left in the care of the butler and housekeeper, while his parents are away. During this time, Phillip's only source of entertainment is the British butler Bains, and his pet snake. Bains' wife, is a shrew and makes Bains' and Phile's life hellish with her nagging. (Really somewhat understandable since she is in charge of housekeeping, and keeping a place that big clean is really not an easy task in those days), however she is also unnecessarily cruel, (for instance, denying Phile a walk in the park with and trying to kill his pet snake).

After an accident occurs at the embassy, Phile is the sole witness and the implications are grim. Was it murder? If so, who is the guilty party? Phile's testimony is not credible.

This film was delicately built, with elements of action, suspense, and drama. I was hooked from start to finish, and found the little boy (Bobby Henrey) who played the part of Phile to be absolutely wonderful, and Ralph Richardson as Bains was also quite good. I'd recommend this for fans of Hitchcock and mystery/dramas in general.",1270857600,,1246,4.7373271889400925

The bond between the lonely son of the French ambassador and the hen-pecked English butler is memorably touching and the emotional heart of the film.

Director Carol Reed has basically a single set to work with. But it's a great one with the sweeping staircase, high domed ceiling, and checkerboard tiles, all keeping the eye entertained at the same time the sinister events unfold.  Those events are driven by poor Sonia Dresdel who has the thankless role of the cruel wife and housekeeper Mrs. Baines that she plays to the hilt. You just know from the start that Phillipe's pet garter snake, MacGregor, is doomed  in her bleak household. In fact, the screenplay has loaded the deck by making her such an unsympathetic figure. Who can blame Baines for his covert rendeszvous with the lovely Julie (Michelle Morgan) when his shrewish wife remains in the empty embassy waiting to pounce.

What really distinguishes the movie is its skill at viewing adult actions through the eyes of the child. Thus, instead of a conventional two-shot close-up of Baines and Julie in intimate conversation, Reed gives us a three-shot from the perspective of Phillipe as he watches them. We may know what's up with them, but we also share the boy's puzzlement over a world he has yet to grow into. We share that perspective throughout, which is not only an unusual one, but visually reinforces the touching bond between the child of the elite and the highly polished commoner. It also turns the emotional climax (not the dramatic) into a memorably revealing one-- a rite of passage, as it were.

 Anyway, in my little book, the movie qualifies as a genuine classic, placing Carol Reed in the same Pantheon as contemporary British masters Hitchcock and Michael Powell. Once you see it, you don't forget it.",1231632000,,2124,4.918994413407821
525120,3,6302969654,"The Fallen Idol is the third film of British filmmaker Carol Reed's that I've seen. Prior to that I've watched the dreadful Oscar-winning musical Oliver!, the solid Charlton Heston biopic of Michelangelo, The Agony And The Ecstasy, and now this. Yes, I have also watched The Third Man, the 1949 film attributed to Reed, but have always hedged upon taking the Warren Commission-like stance that it was Reed's film alone, and not an Orson Welles film merely bearded by Reed. Well, after watching The Fallen Idol, the 1948 film that directly preceded The Third Man, I can tell you that I have no doubts that the bulk of The Third Man was a Welles project that used the functional journeyman studio director Reed as a studio front against the American blacklist.
  This is not because The Fallen Idol is such a bad film- it's merely mediocre, even if it is based upon a Graham Greene work (as is The Third Man)- The Basement Room, but that there are only a few techniques in the film which augur the grandiosity of their usage in the later film- which was so Wellesian, that to contemplate that Reed soared to greatness out of mediocrity, for the single film he collaborated upon with Welles, then resumed a mediocre career, when the more Occam's Razor answer is that it was Welles who guided the vision of The Third Man, is to simply not recognize verities of the way art is created and the way artists work and mature.
  As example, the two later Reed films I mention differ from The Third Man in that they are in color, in different genres, and made many years later, so that one could argue that Reed may have simply `lost his touch.' But, given that The Fallen Idol was made a year earlier, is in black and white, and based upon a work by the same writer, the comparisons between the two films is apt, although the difference in quality is stark. But, why would Reed agree to such a thing? Well, he wanted to break into the American market, where this film did not do as well as other films by Britons as Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean, he shared political sympathies with and an artistic admiration of Welles. Plus, he got locked into a career track that led to greater financial success and recognition even as the requia for his solid artistic talents diminished in need. If you were a man who recognized his limits, and had a chance to help an idol whose techniques you aped, in exchange for personal success, would you refuse? Or would you do so, and deny the obvious to your grave?
  Yet, especially in recent years, there seems to have been a critical movement afoot to try and argue that this mediocre film is somehow on par with The Third Man, and since it is so manifestly inferior, it begs a reasoning of the motives. The one which makes the most sense is that some critics want to argue that Reed was some visionary auteur, and that The Third Man was not such a great sore thumb in an otherwise workaday filmic resume. In short, the argument is clearly meant to bolster the claim that Reed was the force behind both films, rather than just the first one, and a beard for the second. Yet, The Third Man clearly is an oddity- due to its great quality, and unlike the bloated solidity of The Agony And The Ecstasy or the execrable dotty musical Oliver!, this earlier film is the key to unraveling The Third Man's real provenance, for without it, those who deny Orson Welles' hand in that film can obscure their arguments with time, technical developments, and technique, while The Fallen Idol acts as a smoking gun that reveals its creator's limits, its alibiers' motives, and its successor film's great ineffability. And, for that, there is no contrived misreading needed!",1221782400,2,3684,4.5658093797276855
525121,5,6302969654,"Carol Reed's ""Fallen Idol,"" which I first saw as a child, withstands the test of time. Even though I didn't understand the adult implications of the plot then, I have never forgotten the story (still associating it with the little wooden-seated movie house where my father took the family every week to see British films). I was not disappointed; I found it just as absorbing--and even more compelling--half-a-century later.

The screenplay is, needless to say, excellent. Working closely with Carol Reed, Graham Greene rewrote his original short story, ""The Basement Room."" In ""Fallen Idol,"" which takes place at a foreign embassy in London, Greene is actually revisiting the topic of a child's-eye-view of spying, loneliness, betrayal by an idolized adult, and the overhearing of frightening things that are not properly understood (Compare ""Fallen Idol"" to his haunting three-page story, ""I Spy,"" about another small lonely boy who witnesses betrayal and is frightened of things that happen in the dark.). Greene was to collaborate successfully again with Reed on ""The Third Man,"" and--from the sublime to the ridiculous--on ""Our Man In Havana.""

Expertly directed by Reed, the child Philippe--played by Bobby Henrey, a non-actor--is so natural and believable that one might say that he is ably assisted by Ralph Richardson and Michelle Morgan (with Jack Hawkins in the minor role of a detective who lends his chiming watch to the boy in order to distract him). The cinematography is also superb. The moody black and white renders the melodramatic story, which in color might seem overwrought, plausible. The music of William Alwyn, who also scored Reed's ""Odd Man Out,"" further contributes to the stark ambience of the film.

One of the delights of British cinema of the era was the non-sequitur, as when the clock-maker interrupts the police interrogation of Baines, the Butler, in order to wind one of the gigantic embassy clocks.  Just when Reed has wound the plot to its tightest point, he introduces the clock-winder, who serves as a moment of understated comic relief (Part of Reed's genius was knowing when to use moments of humor to lighten the tension.) And yet, references to clocks and watches seem to serve a more subtle purpose in Reed and Greene's scenario, to emphasize both the slowness of time in the mind of the boy and the literal ""watching"" of something frightening that he shouldn't have seen.

This film may not be for everyone (For instance, my son, who likes action flicks in wide-screen surround-sound color, would probably hate it.), but it is certainly recommended for the discerning viewer who likes a time-tested suspense film, which can be not only watched, but also taken at more than mere face-value.",1221350400,4,2736,5.098214285714286

525123,4,6302969654,"""The Fallen Idol"" is a nice little film but anybody expecting director Carol Reed to reach the heights achieved with his masterwork, ""The Third Man"", may be mildly disappointed.  The film is certainly well mounted evoking a noirish feel to it.  Ralph Richardson is first rate as Baines, the embassy butler who spins tall tales to impress his young charge, Philipe(Bobby Henrey).  Henrey gives a natural performance as the boy who idol worships Baines.  The story is a good one.  The theme is essentially that we should be careful in telling impressionable children secrets or lies because it may come back to bite you.  The film is based on a short story by Graham Greene.  The problem I had is that the story may have been stretched a little thin.  Even at an economical 95 minutes I felt that the theme was beaten into the ground.  This probably could have made a better radio play or maybe as a one hour teleplay.  I know this was made in 1948 and television was in it's infancy but you get my point.  I recommend ""The Fallen Idol"" but beware of tedium.",1201392000,,1056,4.534391534391534

I just gave it to my daughter to see with my 16 year old grandson. It knocked the socks off both of them. It is not only the fine story and directing, but the ability to go back to England shortly after the war and get a tiny glimpse of historical English life. Check out the tea shop carefully.

525125,4,6302969654,"The Carol Reed produced and directed ""The Fallen Idol"" a modestly appealing drama centering on the relationship between a boy and his faithful and beloved butler. Phillippe, a lonely young lad played by 9 year old Bobby Henrey is the son of the French ambassador to England.  His household is run by the butler Baines played by Ralph Richardson and his acerbic, vitriolic wife played by Sonia Dresdel, who is despised by both the boy and her husband.

Richardson has been carrying on an affair with consulate worker Julie played by Michele Morgan and wishes to be free of his wife.  The ambassador is called away to care for his convalescing wife leaving the house in the hands of the staff.

During this time Richardson and Dresdel have a major row with the governess accidently falling down a long staircase and breaking her neck.  The boy Phillipe sees part of the fight and assumes that the butler killed her.  In a touching display young Phillipe lies to Scotland Yard investigators to protect his friend and ally Richardson.

Reed creates an aura of suspense and tension as the investigators roam through the mansion searching for clues and trying to pin a murder on Richardson.  A scene involving a paper airplane made from an incriminating telegram is particularly Hitchcockian in its ability to ratchet up the intrigue.  He fashions this taut little drama as seen through the eyes of the young master of the consulate.",1189728000,2,1427,4.839506172839506

Director Carol Reed is at the peak of his powers in this 1948 drama based on a story by Graham Greene, who also wrote the screenplay. Ralph Richardson is wonderful as the butler, and Reed (as the DVD interviews reveal) coaxes a thoroughly believable performance from young Bobbie Henrey as the boy who gets entangled in the intrigues of grownups.

Richardson and Dresdel are marvelous as well-heeled embassy servants whose marriage is empty and bloodless, and whose staircase squabble over Baines's lover Julie (Morgan) results in tragedy. Fusing elements of suspense with a hushed marital drama, Reed sets up the dichotomy between Phillipe's observations of events and the adult world's with depth and sensitivity to his innocence.

It is one of those rare films that can change a bleak ending into a happy one and suffer no diminishment. In Greene's story--perhaps his finest- ""The Basement Room"" the ending which takes place many years later is unrelievedly bleak. My sense is that Greene is reworking his earlier fine story- ""The  End of the Party"" but that is just a guess. In any case ""The Basement Room"" is a masterpiece and should be read before or after seeing the film. The Fallen Idol to its great credit has contrived an ironic and happy ending which while changing the ambience of the story nevertheless works very well. I am no film critic but I think the syntax of the film and its quiet but thrilling focus on the terrifying of the ordinary--the pet. the games. make it the best of the film adaptations of Greene's work (Michael Caine's  Quiet  American is good as well but not in this league.)

Lots to recommend it--atmosphere (a palatial French embassy in London), intrigue (a dreary marraige and secret love affair), and an accidental death that could be murder. All of this is seen through the eyes of a child who must translate what he sees and hears as he desperately tries to save his ""idol""--the man who runs the embassy while his father is away--from being arrested for murder. Charming, playful, and romantic in the beginning,  the film becomes increasingly tense and nerve wracking. It holds you on the edge until the last moment.

525131,5,6302969654,"Some reviewers think Greene's film scripts resemble Hitchcock. They don't. See my review of The Third Man. Greene's major concern in everything he wrote was the question of guilt: in other words, original sin. His concern is with right and wrong, and the machinations of the devil in man. Hitchcock is not concerned with right and wrong. He is interested in Freudian motivation, apart from wanting to give the audience a roller-coaster suspense ride. Greene is not interested in Freud in the slightest. He inserts a clinical scalpel into the convoluted morality of human behaviour, and then twists it. There is extreme tension, of course: how will the plot lines be resolved? In fact, the happy ending of this screenplay is a minor cop-out: but it would be unbearable to have Baines shoot himself. But the viewer is still left wondering what the long-term effect of these experiences will be on the totally confused and disillusioned young boy. Somehow, one feels, the cycle of muddle and deceit will be repeated in the future. This film is much, much more subtle and intellectually sophisticated than anything produced by Hitchcock. Which is why it could hardly have made a fraction of the money pulled in by Hitch.

The reviewer who said this film was shot in a mansion in Chelsea, South London, could not be more wrong. The street locations for the film were in the area of Regent's Park, where the London Zoo is still situated, well north of Oxford Street.",1165881600,38,1460,4.84
525132,5,6302969654,"This is one of the great but previously-near-forgotten films, based on Graham Greene's short story ""The Basement Room."" It's the tale of a French ambassador's son left alone with the household staff at the embassy in London for a weekend while a spot of domestic intrigue slowly unfolds.

What more could you want? Here you've got: one of the great performances in film history by a child actor (coaxed painstakingly by Reed from Bobby Henrey); another superb performance by Ralph Richardson; one of those stories that, like Seth Holt's 1965 film ""The Nanny,"" portrays the sometimes terrifying world of childhood; an incredibly inventive suspense narrative; and a late, third-act appearance by Denis O'Dea as the suave and frighteningly-competent Chief Inspector Crowe.

This is a truly remarkable piece of film. I'll take this one over Reed's other excellent films any day of the week: ""Odd Man Out,"" ""Our Man in Havana,"" ""The Third Man,"" etc. So many of Reed's best films were Greene adaptations, and this one may actually exceed the impact of the source material. This film has all the power of a great Hitchock film.

Note: this Criterion DVD includes a fascinating 23-minute documentary short, ""A Sense of Carol Reed,"" featuring interviews with director John Boorman and a handful of Reed's collaborators.",1163894400,8,1310,5.140845070422535
525133,4,6302969654,"A year before his zither-ignited mystery masterwork, ""The Third Man"", producer/director Carol Reed made this supple, slow-building 1948 thriller replete with his trademark technical precision, and now the Criterion Collection has resuscitated the film with a fine print transfer on a new DVD. Written by novelist Graham Greene, Reed's frequent collaborator, the small-scale, London-set story is focused squarely on Phillipe, the undisciplined eight-year old son of the French ambassador to the U.K. With his parents often away, he has formed a strong attachment to Baines, the ambassador's manservant, but he remains fearful of the strict housekeeper, who happens to be Baines' shrewish wife.

As it turns out, Baines is having a passionate affair with a comely embassy secretary named Julie, and Phillippe stumbles upon them during a tryst. This revelation leads to a series of deceptions that culminates into the death of a key character. It first looks like an accident but not in Phillipe's eyes, as he believes he saw Baines perpetrate the crime. Lies beget more lies until it becomes a labyrinth for the police to find the truth. Reed takes quite a while to set up the basic premise of the story, and it isn't until around the forty-minute mark of this 96-minute film that it really hits its stride. At the same time, he cleverly sets up the story's viewpoint through Phillipe's eyes by using low angles and long distances on several wide-angle shots to show how the boy eavesdrops on fragments of conversations to piece together what he thinks is the truth.

Georges Perinal's atmospheric black-and-white photography helps set up the right mood, especially in the nighttime shots of Phillipe running through the blackened streets of London, and even with a child as the protagonist, Greene's screenplay has a bracingly adult tone throughout. Ralph Richardson shows perfect pitch as Baines, a man who maintains his butler-style composure even as he gets caught up in his own deceits. Even though his French accent makes him hard to understand at times, Bobby Henrey plays the boy unaffectedly, and it's interesting to see how Reed and Graham set up Phillipe's innocence as a plot driver yet risk losing viewer sympathy with the boy's frustrating behavior. Michle Morgan brings understated ardor to Julie, making her passion for the staid Baines palpable if not exactly believable.

Sonia Dresdel effectively portrays Mrs. Baines with wrathful fury, while Denis O'Dea and Jack Hawkins make the inquisitive detectives far less than the stock characters they are. There are some beautifully executed scenes, such as the constantly moving hide-and-seek game and the paper airplane landing at the feet of one of the detectives. There is also an unexpectedly funny scene at the police station where a blowsy hooker (played by Dora Bryan) becomes a maternal figure to Phillippe but can only talk to him like a potential client. While the plot complexities in the last half-hour are deftly handled, the ending is something of a disappointment for all that precedes it.

Although there is no commentary track from an appropriate film scholar as is standard practice for Criterion, the 2006 DVD has one solid extra - a 23-minute featurette, ""A Sense of Carol Reed"", which paints a portrait of the underappreciated filmmaker through remembrances from his colleagues. It shows him to be a rather obsessive personality who struck a strong partnership with producer Alexander Korda but lost his way creatively after Korda's death in 1956 until he died in 1976 (Reed did make the Oscar-winning ""Oliver!"" in 1968).
