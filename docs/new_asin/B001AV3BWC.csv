3467577,5,B001AV3BWC,"This remake has great sentimental value to me. It was released around the time I was getting ready for Prom and about to graduate high school. I'm shocked that so many people hate this movie. It's very different from the 1980 version, but it's still a great film on its own. Brittany Snow stars as Donna, a high school student who is traumatized after an obsessed teacher kills her family trying to get to her.

3 years later, the teacher Richard Fenton escapes from an asylum and comes after Donna on the magical Prom Night. The Prom is held at a luxurious Grand Motel. One by one, Donna's friends are brutally killed so the killer can have her all to himself. (The killer is not masked this time around, and he talks. I usually prefer the killer to be masked, but I can make an exception with this film.) Again, I can't stress enough how much this slasher means to me. Prepare yourself for a night to die for, prepare for...PROM NIGHT!!!",1214092800,6,939,4.459302325581396
3467578,4,B001AV3BWC,"My friend actually drug me to see this movie with her. First of all, I really don't like scary movies because i am a huge chicken when it comes to horror. However, I actually ended up watching all of this movie without being scared once. In the beginning I thought it was going to be scary because the man comes into the house... but after that, it was sort-of a repeat. The same thing kept happening. I really loved the ending. I thought that it was awesome! I wish the rest of the movie had been as good. This movie is worth watching at least once, but it is not the best one I've ever seen. It is a good one to rent when it comes out on video!",1212796800,2,646,4.015503875968992
3467579,1,B001AV3BWC,"This was the WORST ""horror"" movie that I have seen in years, maybe ever and I've seen some pretty bad ones, in example ""Black Christmas."" I didn't think it could get any worse than that. That is, until I saw ""Prom Night""

I didn't go to the theatre with any high expectations. Truthfully, I assumed it would be pretty stupid, but good for a nice laugh. But it went above and beyond that. I honestly don't know how anyone could give this movie more than one star.

The entire movie is completely corny, (the part where they are on their way to the prom is a riot, with their big cheesy grins as their riding in the limo) ridiculously predictable, and utterly boring. There isn't even any suspense as to ""who the killer is"" because you know right from the beginning.

I'm embarassed for the people who made this movie, the people who paid to see this movie (such as myself) and the actors who even agreed to be in the movie in the first place!

Now obviously Brittany Snow isn't an academy award winning actress or anything, but this movie is so beneath her, it isn't even funny. I've seen her in some good roles. She was great as ""kate"" in the movie ""john tucker must die"" and she gave an impressive performance on an episode of ""law and order: SVU"" so why she would choose to be in ""Prom Night"" is beyond me.

The only thing scary about this movie was how frighteningly bad it was.

And the only good thing that came out of going to see it, was seeing previews for the movie ""The Strangers""

Other than that, it was a complete waste of money, and I wouldn't even recommend renting it once it comes out on DVD. Please, save yourself the embarassment.",1211068800,,1649,4.351791530944626
3467580,3,B001AV3BWC,"This release of ""Prom Night"" is its own movie that tries to be a horror. As others have mentioned, it is not a remake. If you like blood and gore in your movies then this is not the movie for you. Though the body count is high, there is no gore. I do not like movies that use blood and gore to make up for lack of good storyline, but I do love suspense. But even here the movie is lacking somewhat.

The movie has some suspense, but nothing that will have you on the edge of your seat. This movie starts off slow with background, which we get from a nightmare, and builds from there to the climax. Though it is an OK film to see, I would suggest you wait and get it from your library. You will not lose much by watching it on the small screen. Though it is not as suspenseful as I would like, it has a somewhat realistic plotline and killer, and for that I added a star.",1210204800,,870,3.9714285714285715

3467582,3,B001AV3BWC,"Prom Night doesn't feel like a remake. I say it's not orignal because there is just nothing new here.  It's a decent, but yet forgettable horror movie.

There is a high body count, but the movie isn't really scary and there isn't much suspense. The movie was predictable but the characters are all pretty likeable.  I especially enjoyed seeing Linden Ashby whom I remember from his Melrose Place days.",1209427200,5,401,4.782608695652174

3467584,2,B001AV3BWC,"Remakes--there seems to be no escaping them nowadays, especially if they're horror movies. ""Prom Night"" is based on the teen slasher film from 1980, and that's funny because one of the remake's production companies is called Original Films. What's even funnier is that, despite the title being the only similarity between the two films, the remake adheres to so many slasher movie clichs that it's no different than you'd expect it to be. The clichs are numerous to the point that you eventually stop counting them. This 2008 version of ""Prom Night"" sucks, plain and simple. It tells a story so predictable you know when the scares will happen. It has characters so one-dimensional they go well beyond mere stereotypes. The circumstances are so preposterous they're barely laughable, and it follows a formula so overused it's no longer amusing. It was one of the rare cases where ninety minutes seemed to go on forever.

The film opens with a dream sequence: three years ago, teenager Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) witnessed the murder of her family, so naturally, the event keeps repeating itself in her sleep. Now an eighteen-year-old in therapy and living with her aunt and uncle, Donna is about to graduate high school. This, of course, means it's time for the senior prom, the one night she's been looking forward to since freshman year. Her friends are also excited. Her best friend, Lisa (Dana Davis), wants like mad to be Prom Queen, although not because she wants the recognition; she just wants to upstage Crissy Lynn (Brianne Davis), a nasty Little Miss Perfect that can't say anything nice to anyone. Donna's other friend, Claire (Jessica Stroup), is having a bit of boyfriend trouble; he's insecure about her moving away to college.

Donna eventually admits that she's stopped taking her anti-anxiety medication because she doesn't want to be numb on prom night, especially since it will be one of the last times she's with her boyfriend, Bobby (Scott Porter). Obviously, being un-medicated would account for the dream sequence at the beginning. She convinces herself that her world is falling apart, but as it turns out, she does have something to be afraid of--her family's killer has escaped from the local mental institution. This calls for a little back-story: Donna had become the love-object of her teacher, Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech). His obsession eventually drove him to murder. Unfortunately, he was institutionalized after being declared insane, so the death penalty wasn't an option. I could explain how he managed to escape, but does anyone really care? And do I have to spell out where he's heading now that he's escaped?

Donna and her friends soon arrive at the hotel where the prom is being held, and initially, everything's wonderful. Lisa's boyfriend, Ronnie (Collins Pennie), even supplies them all with keys to suite 312, because, obviously, they're all going to need a room at some point. Unbeknownst to anyone, Fenton has snuck into the hotel as a guest, and--wouldn't you know it--he just happens to be at the front desk when Ronnie gets the keys. He now knows to keep himself on the third floor, and he wastes no time getting up there. I won't reveal how he gets one of the hotel's master keys, but rest assured it isn't pleasant. Almost nothing about the third floor is pleasant because that's where most of the film's pop-out scares occur. Pretty much every scene in room 312 is a suspenseful ordeal: characters walk around suspiciously, asking if someone's there; there are plenty of places for Fenton to hide in, most notably the closet. Most of the time, the scares are nothing but a series of false alarms, and believe me, that gets old real quick.

By the time Donna begins to feel that something is wrong, the police have gotten involved. No one knows that a few people have died--all anyone does is wonder why someone hasn't returned, after which another character goes upstairs to be murdered. The detective assigned to Donna's case (James Ransone) sounds the alarm and has the hotel evacuated. Donna doesn't leave because she left her scarf up in room 312, and this alone should debunk the idea that an already bad film can't get any worse. Think about it: the police have made it clear that this situation is an emergency, but she has to have her scarf before she can leave. Good God, how dumb do the filmmakers think we are?

The final scenes of ""Prom Night"" play like a supercharged action thriller, mostly because Fenton has the uncanny ability to blend into crowds. One of the most annoying things about this film is this character's lack of mystery. It's not like the original film, in which a masked killer is revealed at the end; we know from start to finish who Fenton is, what he wants, and how he's going to get it. If you're going to make a slasher film, then at least give us an opportunity to guess a thing or two about the plot. Don't leave it all out in the open. That being said, the real problem of this film stems from the slasher genre itself, which has been following the same formula for far too long. Some say that there's no such thing as an original story--all one can do is tell an old story in a new way. ""Prom Night"" is accurately described by the first part of that statement. Had the filmmakers even acknowledged the second part, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now.",1207872000,4,5367,4.791576673866091

You have to do what you have to for that PG-13 rating and if that means omitting a blood bath then by all means.

So, basically, this movie is about a high school teen about to go to prom night. I won't give too much away, because everybody should watch this movie without spoilers, but. The high school teen's parents and brother were murdered about a year before her prom night. The killer comes back for her at prom. The rest is up to you to find out.

Jonathan Schaech is eerie as the killer, he is very handsome and still scary. The young cast is attractive and does a pretty good job.

Naturally, he's smarter than everyone and handily evades capture even after a b-zillion close calls.  With only a knife in hand, he manages to slaughter a lot of people before anyone bothers to notice.  One wonders what class he taught in school to prepare him for his unchallenging career in killing.

3467689,3,B001AV3BWC,"...that's the best way to describe 2008's ""Prom Night,"" which isn't a remake of the 1980 film. Brittany Snow plays the protagonist hounded by an ex-teacher who's psycho-obsessed with her. He escapes from prison and goes on a killing spree at the grand hotel where the prom is held. Jessica Stroup and Scott Porter are on hand as friends of the protagonist.

Being a PG-13 film there's not much gore, but I could care less because I'm more concerned with how interesting the story & characters are and not how much blood & guts are shown. While this is a well-done production -- costing $20 million -- the story & characters are only mildly interesting. The film never rises above mediocre to become something great or even good, but at least it's decent mediocre. For comparison, every single Friday the 13th film is more entertaining. Despite this, ""Prom Night"" was a minor hit at the box office, pulling in well over twice it's expense in the USA alone. Go figure.

Practically the entire movie takes place in a grand hotel, shot at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. The flyover views of the spectacular bridge were shot in Newport, Oregon. The film runs 89 minutes.

In fact, it was rather amusing (and familiar) to watch a killer go from being very proficient at butchering several teenagers in the first hour and then becoming inexplicably and hopelessly inept at killing the protagonist - a lonely teenage girl.

3467731,4,B001AV3BWC,"This 2008 film is not really a remake of the 1980 film of the same name that starred Jamie Lee Curtis. Rather, it is a whole new film with a whole new story line. I became aware of the film when I was visiting Wikipedia and decided to type in Prom Night and I saw that there was a 2008 film with that name and I immediately checked it out. I skimmed through the page ignoring the plot details to immediately go to the link to the film's Internet Movie Database page. I immediately checked for showtimes in my hometown and saw that it was playing at a local bargain movie theater. I immediately went to see the movie unaware of any negative reviews by critics or by Amazon customers. I was also the only person in the theater auditorium watching this movie and I actually enjoyed it. I thought that it was pretty good and though it really isn't a horror movie, which I am a huge fan of, I saw that it was actually a teen thriller that was reality based and showed that a murderer can look like a normal person rather than an angry horribly disfigured person in a mask or sack over it's head.

The movie was written by J.S. Cardone, who happens to be a veteran of writing, producing and directing. He has written, produced and directed some really wonderful films over the past two decades. Check his Wikipedia page for all the details on everything that he has done film wise and you will all see what I mean.

The movie starts with a young lady named Donna Keppel(Brittany Snow)being dropped off at home after seeing a movie with one of her girlfriends and her mother. Upon entering the house, she knows that someone else is in the house and after seeing the dead bodies of her father and kid brother, she hides underneath her bed and witnesses the murder of her own mother by a former teacher of hers(Jonathan Schaech)who was obsessed with her. She is brought to tears, but is afraid to make a sound as she fears that the killer might find her and kill her as well.

Jump to a few years later where we find Donna, who has moved on with her life and is now living with her aunt and uncle, getting ready for the upcoming senior prom. Donna shares what dress she will wear and how sexy it will look as she and a few of her girlfriends are getting their hair done in a saloon. Later on, we see them heading for the prom and the night that they want to remember for the rest of their lives at a local luxury styled hotel. Unbeknown to them, Donna's former teacher, Richard Fenton, is in that same hotel under an alias, as he is a prison escapee, and is waiting to pick up where he left off a few years ago. They even get a room for themselves to hang out in when they want a break from the rest of the class at the prom. That is when the story really starts to unfold as, unbeknown to them, Fenton is also in a room on the same floor where their room is.

In between the teens dancing on the floor at the prom, Fenton starts to kill anyone he feels is in his way and when he approaches Donna in the room while everyone else has evacuated the hotel as a result of the police being in the hotel hoping to catch Fenton, he claims that he has missed her and has always thought of her for the last few years. Donna escapes, but falls into the hands of the police and is safe from Fenton for the time being. But Fenton continues because he wants Donna as his own so bad that he will continue killing to get what he wants. I won't give too much away mainly because that there may be people who haven't seen this 2008 film as of yet and I don't want to spoil anything if they haven't.

Many people criticize this for being a remake of the 1980 horror classic, but in reality, it isn't a remake of that classic horror film. Mr. Cardone has said repeatedly that this film is NOT a remake of the 1980 film, but basically an all new movie with a different story line that has only one thing in common with the 1980 flick, which is only it's name. It is entirely different from that 1980 film as the plot and story line are both different. If anyone out there who has or hasn't seen this film can disown the inaccuracy of this being a remake, they just might enjoy the film on it's own and see the good points that this film really has. I still enjoy the 1980 film to this day and I also enjoy this one as well equally with that classic film.

Nelson McCormick, an experienced TV director, does a very auspicious job for this, his feature film debut and he does an outstanding job in the director's chair with everything that he has in front of him. The film is well acted by it's cast, well written and very well directed and produced. It is also a very technically well made feature film in it's own right. I heartily enjoyed this film and I still do despite some of the negative reviews that I have read from both critics and Amazon customers.

When the Unrated version of this film was put up for pre-order on Amazon, I immediately ordered and it and they shipped it to me so I could receive this the day that the DVD was to be released into the stores. I watched the film again and it was just like it was when I initially saw this at the local bargain movie theater in my hometown. The film was just as colorful and worthwhile as that first time watching it. The Unrated version simply has an extra minute thrown in as there is only a tad bit of gore from that and also, the film has only a little bit of suspense added when the police race against time to stop Fenton before it's too late.

Again, I saw this film in a local bargain movie theater and unaware of any negative reviews by critics or by Amazon customers, I enjoyed the film immensely and thought that it was pretty good flick. I still enjoy this film immensely since that first time and my enjoyment of this has never stopped.

PROS: The picture is beautiful. The audio sounds terrific and the soundtrack sounds crisp. The DVD has some wonderful special features such as four behind the scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, an alternate ending, which has to be seen to be believed, theatrical trailer, and a gag reel. The best feature is when a few of the stars of the film talk about their prom memories as that was terrific. Not only that, I also admit that this particular feature, where the stars of the film talk about their prom memories, brought back memories of my own senior prom. My senior prom was very memorable as I had a blast that night. I danced up a storm and I also danced with a few lovely ladies. The high point of the night was when the class president and I took first runner up honors in the class court for prom king and queen. What a night it was. I still remember it as if it were last night.

I also watched the extra DVD feature of Body Count: Investigating the Murders of Prom Night and it was very interesting.

CONS: While the special features on this DVD were wonderful, it still could have had more of them.

Overall, this 2008 Prom Night is a wonderful teen thriller with a little bit of suspense and is a very entertaining movie that is not at all dull nor a waste. It is a wonderful film and if everyone can disown the inaccuracy about this being a remake, which it isn't, you might just enjoy it more and may even see some of the films hidden greatness if you watch it with an open mind. Again, a wonderful and entertaining film that is worth watching as much as you want to and is also worth owning as well.",1324512000,2,7397,4.230878186968838
3467732,3,B001AV3BWC,"This movie puts you in a ""i know what you did last summer setting"". It's thrilling, but the deranged killer kills his victims so old-fashioned.

I actually liked this movie. Sure I may no longer be of the age to attend prom, but I think we can all relive our teenage years through this (though most of us weren't stalked by a psycho). Some of it seemed like a stretch, but that's generally how it works in horror movies.

I would also like to state for the record that a movie doesn't have to be extremely bloody and gory to be considered a horror movie. I prefer a lot less gore and more suspense, so therefore I was very pleasantly surprised by this. It was suspenseful and felt pretty realistic in many ways.",1309564800,3,834,4.238993710691824

It had a pretty OK plot for a film that revolves around teenagers, but it really can't hold it's own as a good horror movie, if that's what you wanna call it. The beginning is creepy, and then it just moves into the creepy suspense of just waiting for that one person to get killed, because the only extreme suspense is when you're just sitting there watching a teenager alone in a room, obviously about to get killed, and it takes forever for the killer to come out and kill them, so that's what makes the suspense come alive. The ending is OK, but altogether it really fails and it's not worth watching again.

3467736,2,B001AV3BWC,"It's been three years since Donna (Brittany Snow) watched her family butchered by a knife-wielding chemistry teacher (Johnathon Schaech) who had one too many days of high school girls in short skirts.  Still troubled, she goes to therapy and lives with her aunt and uncle, but otherwise is adjusting well.  Prom night is upon her brain-dead senior class and the killer plans on crashing the party.  Chasing the less-than-intimidating killer is Detective Winn (Idris Elba), a hapless civil servant who is always one step behind the killer without a plan.  Paint-by-the-numbers, folks.

To be honest, I have no clue why this movie is rated PG-13.  The gore is nonexistent, the killings are exclusively off-screen, and a recent nosebleed produces more blood.  Actually, I think I do know why the movie was rated PG-13: the acting.  No blood and no boobs, and the evil character lives!  Are the rules of bad horror movies no longer sacrosanct?  The dialogue in this film is sub-moronic, but that may actually reflect teen speak of the day.  The script is worse.  Given the decisions made by the primary characters, I can only assume this was the sexiest, most expensive Special Ed prom in history (rest assured, the cast is attractive).  There is literally nothing worthwhile in this film other than Idris Elba, whose yeoman's effort drowns in a tidal wave of incompetency and predictability.

Director Nelson McCormick should be ashamed of this cookie cutter effort full of continuity errors and plot holes.  It's so bad that MST3K is also not really an option.  The only real suspense?  I'm still not sure who won prom queen.

3467740,2,B001AV3BWC,"Ever since Carrie turned her senior prom into a no-holds-barred free-for-all of revenge, mayhem and murder, we've been subjected to one bloodbath after another set at that annual rite of passage for pimply-faced teens.  You might think that the remake of ""Prom Night"" could not possibly be more hackneyed and predictable than the 1980 original - but you'd be wrong.  In fact, there is not one original idea to be found in this film, neither in its storytelling nor in its filmmaking style.

Brittany Snow plays the pretty blond teen whose entire family was massacred three years earlier by an obsessed teacher who, at the time, looked like only a slightly more maniacal version of Charlie Manson.  Now, it's prom night and the killer, all cleaned-up and ready for action, has just escaped from prison, determined to finally claim Donna for his own (though whether he wants her alive or dead is never made entirely clear).  Thus, as the revelers dance the night away in the ballroom below, an assortment of whiny, horny teenagers - and various hotel staff - meet their untimely ends in the poorly lit suites above.

Nelson McCormick's directorial style consists entirely of obvious point-of-view shots, false scares and images of people popping up in mirrors at inconvenient (though entirely predictable) moments.  The greatest waste is that of Scott Porter and Idris Elba who are both so good in their respective TV series (""Friday Night Lights"" and ""The Wire""), but who have been given absolutely nothing of interest or quality to work with here.",1285632000,3,1547,4.9728682170542635
3467741,1,B001AV3BWC,"I usually refrain from reviewing products I don't care for.  I make exceptions, however, for products that are so bad that I do not want any innocent civilians to waste their money or, even worse, for the creators to turn a profit.

The remake of ""Prom Night"" is that bad.  I cannot even give it the same grudging admiration that I give to such unmitigated goofs as David Lynch's infamous ""Dune"" debacle - at least Lynch swung for the fences.  To keep the baseball analogy intact, Nelson McCormick's ""Prom Night"" is like a guy who tries get hit by the pitch and falls over onto the catcher.

This movie is flat-out boring.  Not scary.  Unterrifying.

The plot is not to blame.  We learn in the first act that an obsessed teacher has murdered the heroine's family and plagues her nightmares.  The poor girl, Donna (the preppily named actress Brittany Snow), does not seem to be particularly worthy of such attentions as she has no attributes beyond sweet innocence.  This girl is so virginal that she blushes when she describes her prom gown as ""sexy"" because it has a corset, and she limits her smooching with her boyfriend to chaste pecks on the lips.  Her two best friends are virtually devoid of personality, although her BBF (black best friend) is offered a couple of near-sassy lines of dialogue to accompany her plunging neckline.

There is an attempt at creating some tension over a vote for who will be prom king and queen, but even the other high school students don't seem to care.  Well, with the exception of one Heather-esque villainness who provides no value to the story whatsoever.

The killer, who has managed to escape from maximum security prison and travel 2,300 miles to the hotel that is hosting the prom just in time to overhear what room Donna and her friends have reserved, walks boldly among the hotel guests without any concern that one of his former students might recognize the guy who murdered the entire family of one of their classmates.  Oh - that's right!  He's wears a black baseball hat - that hat, combined with a haircut, is the perfect disguise.  Ominous music cues every murder, which are surprisingly clean and bloodless even though his weapon of choice is a vicious silver knife.  (One wonders how he can murder so many people without getting a drop of blood on him.)

Idris Elba continues to search for a movie role worthy of his stellar performance on HBO's ""The Wire.""  He does not find it here as he plays a lamebrained cop who is always one step too slow.  To think that this is the same actor who played Stringer Bell is just painful.

This is a paint-by-numbers movie that we have all seen before.  In an attempt to earn a PG-13 label, the movie shuns blood, profanity, T&A, and the like, but also forgets to scare the bejeezus out of you.  A PG-13 movie can be scary.  This movie is just bad.",1284508800,6,2842,4.589285714285714

Flash forward three years, and Donna is trying to move on with her life as she and her friends prepare for their senior prom. Prom Night will definitely be a night she'll never forget when her crazed admirer breaks free from prison and begins slicing his way back in to her life. Much like the other PG-13 Slasher revivals that drowned theaters in the 2000s, PROM NIGHT is a bloodless Thriller tailored specifically for its Teen audiences with absolutely no consideration for the fans that made the original films so popular. To its advantage, the young cast is actually filled with actors and actresses that look like real teens. The film also makes no attempt at concealing the identity of the killer, which allows him to become a ruthless and calculated villain. This is about where the positive praise ends for the otherwise boring and formulaic picture. While it isn't necessary poorly made, it is entirely uninteresting, and lacks the gratuitous gore and nudity that Slasher fans crave. PROM NIGHT brings nothing new or interesting to the table, and is best left to its designated audience (if not forgotten).

Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the killer just isn't scary or interesting at all. In fact, he looks bored during the Lisa character's chase scene.
The original Prom Night also had a large cast but managed to develop most of the characters at least somewhat. This movie has tons of throwaway characters like the gym teacher, the psychologist, and Chrissy (Lisa's rival for prom queen) -- who could be made interesting, but are instead introduced and then abandoned.

In-name-only remake of 1980's not-so-classic slasher flick ""Prom Night"" which originally starred Jamie Lee Curtis. The whole film is one big mess! i mean the film does have bad acting and direction. One of the biggest problems with this one is that it's a dull slasher flick with no imagination, no good kills or even a sense of fun as it's a total loser.

This Blu-Ray offers terrific sound and picture quality but that still doesn't make up for the movie not even the unrated version here.

3467747,1,B001AV3BWC,"I saw the ""Unrated"" version of this film, and find it unbelievable that there could actually be a more watered down version than this. I have seen more blood when I cut myself shaving. I usually find blood in horror films to be gratuitous and overdone, but it's unrealistically understated in this film, which I'm sure will disappoint real horror fans. If you saw the PG13 version, the unrated is no better. This movie is really just a movie about a prom and overblown relationships between over-indulged teens that happens to have an obsessed slasher in it, rather than a slasher/thriller. We are shown the killer at the very start of the film as he falls for the ""hiding under the bed trick"" for the first time. It's one of the girl's teachers that looks like a cross between Jesus and Charles Manson. Three years of therapy pass, and the girl is getting ready for prom when the killer escapes from the mental institution and is wearing a clever disguise that makes him look like a cross between Billy Bob Thornton and Harry Connick Jr. He actually just got a shave and haircut, but nobody recognizes him. Must've been the ball cap. Truly a master of disguise. The police decide to stake out the prom, and what a prom it is. Red carpet and ropes, grand ballroom, it makes the Oscars look like league night at the bowling alley. The rest of the film is kids crying about going off to college as Billy Bob stabs everyone in sight. He does have the fastest, most deliberate stabbing motion that I've ever seen, and the killings take about 3 seconds as the victims go as limp as a gazelle in a lions jaws. No defensive wounds here. There will be none of that long, drawn out murder like the shower scene by that Hitchcock guy, cuz Billy Bob's motto is ""Git'er done"", besides, they are about to announce the King and Queen.

This movie is basically one big collection of every overused cliche ever devised, minus the screeching black cat. Open a door, someone's there, close a door, someone's there, yank back the shower curtain, hide under the bed, cue pigeons, hide uner the bed again, yank back another shower curtain, fiddle in closet, take your meds, walk backwards, check closet again, run into lamp, yank back shower curtain, so that's what happened to the maid's body. I guess it never hurts to look. While this movie isn't really appallingly bad, it's still pretty bad. I did make it to the end, which is more than I can say for ""Black Christmas"", but I think alot of that has to do with how much fun I was having playing Nostradamus for my kid as I predicted every move onscreen, and at one point even got the dialog word for word. Extra bonus points for the dialog. It might make a good drinking game. It was THAT predictable, and since predictability is the opposite of suspense, this movie is a huge FAIL. There's no blood, guts, nudity, suspense, terror, good music, sympathetic characters, comedy, drama, nothing except pretty people at a dance.

Move along folks, there's nothing to see here. Now I'm off to walk backwards into my bathroom to pull back the shower curtain, then check my closet again. Housekeeping? Where's that darn maid?",1262736000,3,3151,4.595026642984014

The kids solemnly spout lines that were used a bridges between the songs in GREASE (""The prom is the end of school--what if we never see each other again!"").  The production values are good, which only highlights the utter lameness of the proceedings.

In the 70s and 80s, drive-in horror flicks provided fun through over-the-top violence, ridiculous storylines, and hot chicks in various stages of undress.

The film starts off with a beautiful MTV type blonde who comes home to find her parents and brother murdered by some psycho. They catch him and lock him away from life but he escapes...on her prom night! The prom nights were typical teen movie party scenes that I just fast fowarded through. The killer is one of the worst killers in cinema history, almost laughable. He wears a suit, a baseball cap, and one expression. The kills are not shown on camera as a marketing ploy to make people go out and buy the ""Unrated, too scary for theaters"" dvd edition. I will not buy the unrated version based on the movie.

3467751,1,B001AV3BWC,"Of all the movies I've watched in the past year, I can honestly say ""Prom Night"" is the ONLY movie I sat through that doesn't even deserve a single star rating.

Where do you start with this thing?

1. It's a slasher movie. I love slasher movies, it's my favorite horror genre. I grew up in the early 80's when a new slasher flick came out every weekend, and I saw them all. What is the attraction of the slasher flick? Watching the kills of course. You want to see Jason slaughter camp counselors in imaginitive or gory ways, it's the DNA of a good slasher flick. ""Prom Night"" is supposed to be a slasher flick, except it has almost no slashing! The slashing that is present has no gore! If someone stabs a worthless teen with a knife there should be blood! Why try to make a PG-13 slasher movie? Go ahead and make all the blue tinted PG-13 Asian ghost stories you want. Folks are lining up to watch PG-13 vampires turn all sparkly in the sunlight while molesting high school girls, that's all fine and dandy, but don't water down the slasher genre.

2. Are all Prom's multi-million dollar affairs these days? Since when do paparazzi show up at high school proms and line the red carpet? Where are the ugly people in this school? Even the killer looks like he just walked off the set of a Target commercial. The rest of the cast is made up of the usual rainbow coalition characters found in every teen flick pumped out these days. Everyone is so bland and boring, you simply can't wait to see them killed. Unfortunately even when they do die, it's so blah you can't even root for the killer.

Please, as a fellow horror fan, I implore you, don't waste your time here. Feel free to go back and watch the remake of ""Black Christmas"" or ""The Fog"" instead. I thought both of those remakes represented the nadir of horror remakes but I learned my lesson after watching ""Prom Night""....the pit of suck isn't deep enough for Hollywood and they can always sink further.",1251763200,2,2179,4.467336683417085

3467760,2,B001AV3BWC,"You might not agree but you can understand the desire to remake horror films such as Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street.  However, is Hollywood so devoid of imagination that they now have to remake lackluster films from the 1980's?  When the original Prom Night came out in 1980, the slasher genre was still in its infancy and can hardly be considered a classic.  In fact, the only thing notable about the original is that it starred Jamie Lee Curtis.  Okay, so this Prom Night isn't a true remake although the plot of a killer, stalking students during their High School prom, is still the central theme.

A deranged school teacher, obsessed with Donna (Snow) murders her entire family before being caught by police.  Three years later, on the night of her prom, the police find out that the killer escaped from the asylum where he had been committed.  As Donna, her boyfriend Bobby (Porter) and their friends enjoy their prom in a posh hotel ballroom, the killer, Richard Fenton (Schaech) has made his way there as well.  The police, led by Detective Winn, converge on the hotel to locate the killer as the body count rises.

Prom Night is as predictable as they come and because of that, there is little suspense.  It's like the scenes were pieced together from every other slasher film you've ever seen.  You know who is going to die and who is going to survive.  Worse, Prom Night is a dumb film, filled with characters doing dumb things.  When the police evacuate the hotel, hoping to trap the killer inside, Donna decides she HAS to run back up to the third floor because she forgot her mother's shawl. And yes, I don't think I'm playing spoiler too much to say who is waiting for her in the room.  When Donna is taken to her home by the police do they leave a squad to protect the killer's target?  No!  They leave two cops!  When Winn discovers that the killer has escaped the hotel he races to Donna's house but doesn't call for backup until he's actually inside, conveniently leaving the Swat team to eat donuts back at the hotel.  The killer, naturally, seems to be smarter than the entire police force, not too mention a master of disguise and stealth.  He easily eludes dozens of cops and can disappear without a trace.

The theatrical version of the film was rated PG-13 and this ""unrated"" version is just as tame.  There's little blood and gore for a slasher film. It seems like Prom Night was targeted for young teens and serious horror fans will find little that is compelling in the film.

3467765,2,B001AV3BWC,"28 years ago a fairly successful horror movie was released starring the then-reigning scream queen, Jamie Lee Curtis (""Halloween""), and dealt with teenagers being murdered on what should be one of the happiest nights of their lives, Prom Night. Fast-forward to 2008, and director Nelson McCormick (TV's ""Prison Break"") and writer J.S. Cardone (""The Covenant"") have attempted to serve up another dose of mayhem and murder surrounding that festive evening with a loosely-inspired remake of the 1980 slasher film of the same name, the appropriately titled ""Prom Night"".

""Prom Night"" is the story, as you may have guessed by the title, of a group of teenage friends attending their high school prom, except what should be a night of fond memories, will end up becoming a night of horrifying nightmares for those that survive. Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow), a popular girl in the school, lost her entire family to a killer obsessed with being with her. Now, on the night she has waited for throughout her entire high school life, the killer returns to finish what he started.

I will admit that I have only seen bits and pieces of the original ""Prom Night"" that starred Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen, and what I've seen appeared to be fairly predictable, as most horror films in the 80's tended to be. So, I'm pretty confident I could surmise what happened in the end without ever finishing the movie. With this 2008 incarnation that has been dubbed a remake by most viewers, albeit an extremely loose one at that, the same predictability of the original continues to exist even in today's incarnation and the movie definitely does not benefit from it. ""Prom Night"" begins with a very brutal opening sequence that definitely catches the audience by surprise. When watching this surprising opening portion of the movie, you are given this false sense that perhaps you are going to be watching a horror film that is in the vein of the slashers of the 80's; except that this is one that actually knows how to send thrills and chills through you. However, after that initial sequence ends you quickly begin to realize that this movie is going to fall extremely short of the expectations that its opening had set you up with.

I was intrigued by the story at first, not just because of the opening sequence, but because writer J.S. Cardone had actually created an extremely creepy villain (Johnathon Schaech) that was not supernatural as many of the villains in the traditional horror films have been. This villain is one that may actually exist somewhere in the world, and that is a very frightening prospect when you stop to think about it. Even though the killer was much more believable than most within horror films, the movie quickly loses itself amongst numerous horror movie clich&eacute;s, insipid dialogue, and an undeniably heavy dose of plot holes and continuity errors; not to mention the fact that the movie unfolds in such a predictable fashion that it simply boggles the mind that any writer would even bother submitting this as a finished screenplay.

The biggest problem that I had with ""Prom Night"" was the numerous plot holes and continuity errors that plagued the film. Many movies have these problems, sometimes you can ignore them, but there are times when they occur so frequently that it becomes flat-out distracting and there's just no denying their existence. ""Prom Night"" falls into the category of a movie with so many plot holes/errors that there isn't enough substance left over to make the movie work in any logical sense. One of the main sources of the problem was the fact that whenever the killer murders someone (and this isn't really spoiling anything, because everyone has figured out by now that murders occur in horror films), he somehow is able to move their body without making any noise when someone may be in the other room, and also without leaving any kind of bloody trail or blood stain of any kind. Yeah right, give me a break.

Leading the cast of mostly unknown teenagers, many of which I doubt will have all that lengthy of a career in Hollywood, was the surprisingly talented actress Brittany Snow (""Hairspray""). Brittany easily carried this film on her own, and her likeability and talent as an actress made the movie at least bearable, but one can't help but wonder why a young actress as talented as she bothers to debase herself by coming within ten feet of this garbage. The only reason I can figure is that Brittany most likely viewed this as an opportunity to expand her fan base by gaining the exposure amongst teenagers that a horror film can provide; however, there have got to be better choices out there than something this ridiculous and uninspired.

The rest of the teenage cast, or at least those pretending to be that young, was a mixture of those that were moderately talented individuals, to those that shouldn't expect much more work to come their way later. Many members of the cast fell into the latter category. The only other good performance in the movie, aside from Brittany Snow's, would be from Johnathon Schaech as the film's creepy villain. Although Johnathon created an interesting and realistic villain, whoever made the decision to have him walk slower than a snail during the killing sequences really should have taken a few more moments to think that through. In most horror movies, especially those of the ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th"" variety, the killer tends to walk unbelievably slow for someone trying to make a killing; however, as slow as those killers walk, their victims normally stop to hide/catch their breath which allows the killer to catch them. With ""Prom Night"" the killer walks slower than Jason or Michael Myers ever did, and his victims rarely stop running away; yet somehow he manages to catch them every time and to me that is a problem for believability in a movie that is already pushing the limits in that area to begin with.

With too many problems that plague the entire movie, ""Prom Night"" fails to deliver any sort of thrills or chills to the audience; mostly because the audience is too busy laughing at how stupid everything and everyone is within this movie. I must point out that the filmmaker, Nelson McCormick, was smart enough to determine that his movie had far too many problems; so he kept the movie's pace going along at a very fast rate. This was done so the audience would hardly have any time to notice all of the little inconsistencies or impossibilities that kept occurring throughout his pale imitation of a horror thriller.

But when it comes down to gore, blood and a slasher flick this is worse than my proms. There's relatively little blood, which is different, and I believe done on purpose. You know who the killer is from nearly jump street. Doesn't leave much to the imagination. He kills with a purpose, but I think he killed one too many people.

I was a bit put of by the fact that the interaction between him and Donna was surprisingly little. The killer is a psycho and I was left wondering what he saw in her that made him go crazy like that.

Switch to 2007 and you've got the latest wretched remake of a classic.

When they're not remaking every hideous Asian horror flick like ""Mirrors"" ""The eye"", ""The Grudge,"" they're desecrating such classics as ""Prom night,"" ""Halloween,"" ""The Fog.""

In this anemic mess, we're supposed to believe that the survivor of a mass murder is STILL living in her house and on the anniversary of the slaughter, she goes to the prom. In atrocities like this one, she and her fellow empty-headed buddies do everything stupid you can imagine.

When the prom is suddenly shut down because the police are now aware that the killer has returned, what does the heroine do? She goes back upstairs to retrieve something--while her fellow party-goers are all racing down the steps.

This is a Pure Vanilla movie. It's pretty and bland and boring and the only good thing about is the terrific box cover/poster that shows a screaming victim.

3467772,3,B001AV3BWC,"There is an inherent problem when remaking any film. That problem is the fact that the movie has been made once and has fans of the original film who look upon any remake as sacrilege. In some cases this might be worthwhile criticism but in most it's not. The reason is that in some cases, the film is not necessarily a remake but more a retelling. Or it could go the route of tossing out the original altogether and telling it's own story while taking the name from the original. It's these movies that are unjustly criticized before being seen. And the genre with the biggest fan base, as well as the most remakes, is the horror field. Trust me, horror fans are like pit bulls when it comes to defending their original favorites.

So it is we see the release of PROM NIGHT. The original film starred Jamie Lee Curtis, fresh from her scream queen beginnings and about to star in THE FOG and TERROR TRAIN that same year, and revolved around a revenge killing of teens at their senior prom who had been involved in the death of a child earlier. The new release tosses aside that whole story, keeping only two aspects: the prom and a murderer. Had they titled it something different, perhaps it wouldn't have received the drubbing of fans and critics alike when it was released.

This time around we begin with the murder of an entire family, the last of which is the mother who is killed before the eyes of terrified teen Donna (Brittaney Snow) who has sought refuge beneath her bed. The killer is caught and turns out to be one of her teachers, Mr. Fenton (Jonathan Schaech) who has become obsesses with the girl. Off to jail he goes, off to her aunt and uncle heads Donna and years pass.

Donna deals fairly well with the murder of her family through counseling and turns into a nice, normal teen. She gets through high school, has a boyfriend, is dealing with heading off on her own to college and finally, is preparing for that big teen social event, the senior prom. Faced with these changes, she begins having nightmares but as her therapist explains, that's normal when dealing with change.

We meet Donna's friends, boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) - the good guy that everyone likes, Lisa (Dana Davis) - the popular cheerleader who has a grudge against rich girl snob Crissy (Brianne Davis) and Ronnie (Collins Pennie) - the star football player. The friends have rented a double room in the hotel that the prom will take place in, a prom paid for by Crissy's wealthy dad. It seems Crissy and Lisa are competing for prom queen and the cattiness between the two is apparent from their first encounter.

Unknown to Donna is one thing that will make her prom night an unforgettable one. Mr. Fenton has escaped from the mental facility he was being kept in. A mental facility instead of jail because he was ruled criminally insane and sent there rather than executed for murder. Isn't it funny that the Hollywood elite decry the use of capital punishment in real life yet always seem to show murderers escaping to wreak havoc when they get life or are ruled criminally insane?

Of course Mr. Fenton tracks down Donna to her new family and head out to discover more about her whereabouts. When he finds out she's at the swank hotel and her prom, he heads that way and with no effort gets a suite on the same floor as Donna and her friends, paid for with the credit card of one of his new victims.

Two steps behind, the police are notified three days after his escape that Fenton is lose. Detective Winn (Idris Elba) blows his top and sets up his force to find Fenton and prevent another massacre. Having been the police officer in charge the first time around, he knows the brutality Fenton is capable of.

So much for the set up. Any fan of horror knows that much bloodletting will follow, sudden pop ups of characters and props will mislead or cause you to jump and that eventually Donna will be forced to confront her tormentor. Along the way characters we come to like or hate will be slaughtered and the murderous ways of Mr. Fenton will be seen by one and all. Sure it's a tried and true formula, but so what? Aren't half of all horror films formulaic?

What we get instead is a new killer with a new way of behaving. Schaech does a great job as Fenton. Not only are we presented with a mad, stalking murderer, we get a tad insight into the motivation of the same. With subtlety and maneuvering, Schaech presents Fenton as a conniving and manipulative villain who can get in unseen and escape the same way.

The rest of the cast does a decent job as well. All of the teens involved look more like teens here than the stars of the original film. And their job is not to reveal depth since victims rarely are given a back story with the exception of the lead. Snow does a fine job as Donna, offering both an innocence and a shattered victim who takes the blame for all things bad in her life, not realizing she is the receiver and not the instigator.

All in all this movie is not the pariah that some would have you believe. Sure, it offers little in the way of new horror or scares. Granted it is using a formula that has been done before. But then again, when you choose to ride a roller coaster and then a second, is it reduced in effect because it is a different one? Does the same coaster lose its effect the second time around? This movie is made for fun. Forget the past, forget the original and enjoy this one on its own merits. It may not be worthy of screening at the Aspen festival, but its fun on its own.",1222128000,4,5524,4.421828908554573

3467775,3,B001AV3BWC,"First of all, to all cops in such movies; AIM FOR THE HEAD. I really liked this movie. It had all the right ingredients: not to much killing, no grotesque killing, just old fashioned stabbing and neck slashing. Everything I loved about it also devalued it, in that there was nothing new, just different actors, although good acting. The 20-something playing teens has gotten kind of old. Brittany Snow lacked something of that teen-in-terror quality. Jonathan Schaech was miscast, though almost anyone could have played his part, as his character did not speak or emote  much. Would have liked to have seen Jason Behr or Donnie Wahlberg in the role. Would have like to have seen the role given more meat as well. Suppose Schaech's character had murdered her family years earlier, but she had never came home  that night or seen his face, but heard his discuised voice? Three years later her teacher is a prom shaparone and then events proceed.

As much as I like it, it should have been a straight-to-dvd movie , as it was more than a movie of the week, but less than theatre material. It needed something new. It also needed us to get more emotionally involved with the characters. This was not there. We only got a little screen time with the ""prom  _itch."" We did not really get to know her enough to hate her. Even if the boyfriend was murdered the way he was at the end, which was good for the movie, there should have been some earlier physical confrontation with Schaech's character. Also , too much time with the cop.

I will buy this movie, but it left me wondering , if only they had done it this way. Remember, AIM FOR THE HEAD. One stolen bullet proof vest and Donna would have been worm food.",1220572800,3,1705,4.5227272727272725

The only character I did end up caring about was Donna, her friends had such dull storylines that you almost didn't miss them when they died.

The cast isn't bad, and the cinematography and lighting are clearly professional, but (like the Black Christmas remake) there are no improvements on the original. The lead finds herself facing off with the baddie twice, but learns nothing and responds no differently the second time. In fact, she has to be saved - this is actually a retrogression, as with the Halloween remake, where the lead similarly doesn't modulate her reactions in any way. In both cases, the original had a stronger and more lifelike female. I doubt this will even develop a cult following, like the not-so-great original with its scarifying disco soundtrack.

2. Packed to the rim with horror movie cliches.

7. Uses the ""boo"" technique ineffectively and excessively.

8. Uneven pacing.

9. Brainless script.

10. You get the drift. This movie is just pathetic in its execution and is going to set back horror films 100 years.  If you want a real horror flick watch The Cat In The Hat(2003). Its scarier than anything you'll ever see in this by-the-numbers slasher flick.",1219536000,,788,4.557142857142857

Yet, knowing who the killer is throughout doesn't really lend itself to the teen slasher genre.  Prom Night offers little in terms of scares and gore.  Produced by Neal H. Moritz, this film feels much akin to a movie he created prior:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer/dp/6305017115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>.

I would stick with the original in terms of suspense.  As for this recent ""Prom"", unless you are a teenaged fan who thrills to the stereotypical characters and slick photography, you might as well skip it.",1219536000,,937,5.6571428571428575
3467784,2,B001AV3BWC,"This tells you the movie in general.  I don't think there is anything that will spoil ther movie for you.  Besides the movie itself.

I have wanted to rent this for a few weeks.  I thought it may be ok.  I never saw the original Prom Night with Jamie Lee Curtis.  As the movie starts there is one thing you notice.  Well I should say at about the 10 minute mark.  You notice the bad c level cheesy teen TV show style acting.  Now I'm not saying these actors can't act.  I am simply saying that in this movie, it's as if they were sitting abound playing cards then got did some recording for 20 minutes and went on about their business .  The movie starts out with some kids getting ready for their prom.  Then a killer escapes whom apparently was obsessed with the girls who is attending.  One cop arrested him before and is there to stop the man before he gets the girl he is obsessed with.

Being the obvious scripted horror movie that lets SO many things happen that no intelligent human would allow to happen in the circumstances that surrounded it, they decide to let the girl go to the prom with her boy friend and 4 other friends.  The killer gets to the prom and the police have to prevent him from killing.  That is the whole movie.

I was able to see what would happen before the previews had even finished.  The acting is really bad the the story makes you feel like you missed something important in a previous movie.  Maybe this story is tied into the first original movie.  If so I have never seen the first one so I was lost with that part.  If not they do such a bad job of filling you in on the story based before the movie that you start to loose interest.  The plot is ok.  I mean I've seen t before.  Young attractive girl is stalked by a killer while either babysitting, home alone or at an event with friends who are about as smart as a brick.  More than likely you will know what is going to happen by about the 30 minute mark.  I didn't get frightened at any point nor was I interested after about 40 minutes.  I only watched it because I was staying up to see if I won a bid on eBay (which I did, hello Chevy Chase LP).  I don't remember any real language or violence.  I mean you saw people being killed but you saw little blood.  Again I felt like I was watching that TV show from the 90s.

The fact is this was a very predictable movie with good actors whom only use half their ability to act.  They have many things that happen that never conclude or have any reason for being on the movie.  I think they had a 50 minute movie on their hands and they put a bunch of random stuff in to fill the time.  This will not scare or thrill you and you will probably laugh at the points in the movie that are supposed to frighten you.  I would say if you must see this.  Rent it.

Unfortunately for Nelson McCormick and this version of Prom Night, that is exactly what this film is. PREDICTABLE: Nothing new here. It is recycled cheap scares (that don't deliver). You have seen these scenes in a hundred movies before. FLAWED: Script is generic, and the reasoning illogical. Either we have the cleanest psychotic killer in movie history, or his victims don't bleed...because you never see a spec of blood on him, and when the bodies are moved (to the most absurd locations), there is never any blood left behind. Also, one of the main characters is up for Prom Queen and she really wants to win so she can stick it to the class snob. She wants to win it so bad, that 15 minutes before the crowning event takes place, she and her boyfriend decide to leave the party and go make out upstairs instead. Uhhh...ok then. BORING: The filmmaker's have decided to introduce you to the killer right off the bat, so there is no ""surprise"" element in the film at all.

3467789,1,B001AV3BWC,"Just to put my own two cents in...This is NOT a remake of the 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis film. The only similarity between the two is that they have a Prom in them. That's it. Nothing else even slightly resembles the 80's film.

  This film was mediocre at it's best moments. And those moments were scarce. Jonathan Schaech stars *and i use the term stars VERY, VERY lightly* as a psychotic, obsessed teacher who will stop at nothing to have his doe-eyed teen-student played by Brittany Snow, all to himself. He slaughters her whole family and she barely makes it out with her own life.

Cut to a year or so later and we find Brittany ""coping"" with the loss of her mom, dad and brother by going to her senior prom. Now, I think it might just be me, but If my entire family was hacked down by a person obsessed with me, i would probably feel a LITTLE guilty dancing it up at a senior prom. I think it would take me at least a decade until I could go out and party-it-up knowing that my family is dead because of someone who wanted to be with me. BUT, THAT'S JUST ME! CALL ME DEPRESSING...BUT, I WOULD WALLOW IN THAT GRIEF AND GUILT!

  Anyways, Prom Night fails to deliver. It might just be because it's a movie aimed at a different generation than mine. My own senior Prom was 8 years ago, and culture seems to have changed (for the worse) in a lot of regards. The film definetly caters to the youth of America, which is normal. I could totally see younger teens and high school age kids loving this film...because it ties in that all-important Prom ritual that most kids look oh-so forward to (Ummmm, YAY) and there is nothing wrong with that.

  But, this film felt SO all over the place. It was hard to really understand where it was going at times. The killer had no logic or reason to the people he killed. He just sat around and killed people for no reason. I especially didn't appreciate him stabbing the poor Latina maid who was probably working nights so her kids could wear decent looking clothes, while the spoiled, Gossip Girl hoochie mama's whine and moan about who is going to win the coveted Prom Queen title. I thought it was a little gratuitous with that death scene. If you are going to make a teen slasher flick...stick with killing the teens, don't slaughter random cleaning women. Once again, I'm just being critical.

  Overall, the movie just felt WRONG to me. There was just something missing. I think a lot of it had to do with my own personal lack of sympathy towards that specific social clique-I really don't mind seeing the Bitchy girls (You know the type-The brats you see on MTV's SWEET SIXTEEN screaming that they wanted a BLACK Lexus instead of a Red one) and the a-hole Jock types (The ones who called you a f*g or rammed you into lockers) get picked off one by one because...errrrrrr...they kinda deserve it as far as the land of fictional Horror goes.
Let's face it, 75% of those kinds of kids in school were total douchbags and you KNOW you liked seeing a fictional version of them get a little fantasy retribution. haha.

  Oh well...take it for what it is...a cheesy, marketing idea to draw teens to the theaters with a couple of mindless jump scenes and pretty, sparkly prom gowns.

Naturally, it just so happens to be the night of the big prom, and from beginning to end, Prom Night is an awful, utter bore.  Nothing scary or close to suspenseful is to be found here, and the film as a whole (even unrated) is a tame and neutered slasher that provokes more yawns more than anything else.

If you're interested in a cheesy predictable movie, or if you are a beginner when it comes to watching a thriller, then this movie is for you. It's not the worst thriller I've seen but definitely nowhere near a good to the best one I've seen. When I say thriller, I am not referring to any movies with a supernatural evil element. Anyways, there were too many cliches and to me, the trailer was a false advertisement. In addition to unrealistic plot points.

First problem, how does a man who murdered a whole family escape from an institution and the detective and other officials who were responsible for his imprisonment is NOT notified immediately but instead 3 days later? Especially given the circumstances on how he is locked up.

My other problem with the movie: why and how is it that everyone conveniently wanders off on their own, by themselves in a big hotel where they are not familiar with???

Third problem: If Claire was on her period, and her boyfriend began tripping, why did she even stay at the prom? I know she didn't want her night to be ruined, but come on. When she was in that sweet by herself and felt she was not alone and knowing her girlfriend just left, she should have bounced. I get it...that's the point of the movie...lol, but still. Her part did not make much sense.

Fourth problem: Lisa and her boyfriend were expected to win prom queen and king. Why did they insist on going to the sweet to have sex knowing the DJ and the principal were going to announce who the winners were? And....took the phone off the hook! They could not have been that horny. That part did not make sense AT ALL! NOT AT ALL!  If Lisa recognized him and knowing what he was capable of doing, she should have told her boyfriend and they should have gone down together, not by herself. They had no business leaving in the first place. Hull....

Fifth problem: okay, the hotel is being evacuated....why and how did she manage to get on the elevator? Elevators in an emergency crisis like that no longer operate. It does not go up beyond the first level.

It seems like the only rising action was when their teacher was in pursuit of Lisa. Other than that, the movie lacks a solid plot that leads up to climaxes and rising action. All that we see happening is people going to a sweet and being butchered because they either a) saw and could identify the man and he had to kill them or b) they are friends with his prey and they are conveniently at the wrong place at the wrong time. Basically, the viewers are not left with any element of surprise. Everyone knows whoever went to the sweet was going to be murdered. Lol. Bottom line. Great movie for someone who is nervous about watching a slasher film though. I would recommend the movie for a beginner.",1500854400,2,2805,4.456140350877193

And I did watch the whole thing so there was something entertaining about it. But it truly is just SUCH a bad movie. I mean the polot is okay, her witnessing her mom's murder is interesting, but god how many freakin' times can i watch brittany snow back up into an inanimate objet (door, lamp, etc.) and scream? and SOOO much tripping and falling for no good reason. It's just a whole bunch of pop-scares that really aren't scary, a loose plotline. a VERY anti-climactic, rushed, and disappointing ending, and overall just another high-budget gimmick scare movie thats entertainment but nothing more.",1495238400,,735,4.705426356589148
