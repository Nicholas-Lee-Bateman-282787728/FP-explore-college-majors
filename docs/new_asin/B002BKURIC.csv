8361614,3,B002BKURIC,"I had a hard time getting past the setting. I mean, ugly. Ugly and plain. Her work out is good for real beginners, and I did like her 10 minute walk. But I don't like towel workouts, and she NEVER stops talking. Never. I have her book on exercise and it is very good.  Buy it, and get more for your money than this DVD. I would have given another star if her set had been waaaaay better, and I would do it more often.",1362960000,3,417,3.9058823529411764
8361615,5,B002BKURIC,"I had heard about these videos through fitbottomgirls.com. And let me tell you, THEY WORK.

I am someone that has been battling my weight my entire life. I have gone really down and then blown way up. Prior to doing this DVD, I felt pretty hopeless about being able to do something that could be fun and also help me lose weight. As a very obese guy, it is challenging to find low impact DVDs that push you enough, but not so much that you injure yourself.

But this workout is different. Kim Lyons does a BRILLIANT job of going through the motions with a positive attitude and a caring, accepting tone. She constantly reassures the viewer how important it is to be proud of doing any fitness and how getting started is the hardest part. She is this perfect cheerleader without verging on annoying.

I love every step of the workout. The Warm up gets your head in the right place doing simple movements while sitting. The next part incorporates more arm movements and more intensive stretching. It is amazing how much you can work your arms without weights. I really felt the burn, like I was creating new muscles.

Then it moves into the walking section. I know some people wanted a complete sit-down work out, but Kim does a great job of coming up with less intense variations of all of the walking exercises and continues to state that the most important part is not giving up and doing your best (along with good breathing and posture of course).

Then you get to the Cool Down...it feels so good at the end, knowing you did the work out and feeling how much looser your body feels and how much stronger your muscles are going to be. She ends it with this ""Touchdown"" stretch that always feel amazing.

I believe this DVD is saving my life. I believe this DVD could save the lives of millions of people feeling intimidated and overwhelmed by 95% of the fitness DVDs out there. This is the perfect start. I am going on my third week of working out with this and can definitely see the pounds dropping and my clothes feeling looser.

If you are anxious or scared or feel hopeless about EVER finding a workout you can handle, then do this workout. This is not a workout for people expecting intermediate or Advanced work...it is supposed to be gentle, but progressive enough to create change.

One of the best purchases I have ever made. I know my weight loss journey is going in the right direction because of Kim Lyons' DVD. Thank you!",1330992000,12,2438,4.487584650112867
8361616,5,B002BKURIC,"I've been working out with this DVD everyday for a couple weeks and I really enjoy the routine Ms. Lyons designed. It has been easy on my back and knees. ( There is a special move called the ""James Bond"" that really stretches my back.) The dread factor is very low. It is great to workout with an instructor who actually seems to enjoy what she is doing and has fun. The one downfall ( maybe an intentional downfall) is that the upper body and lower abs are the focus of the strength training segment of the workout. None of the exercises are for the legs. The strength training segment lasts 10 minutes, and then there is a 10 minute indoor walk.

In all, the video has two 20 minute workouts and each has a great warm-up, strength training routine, walk, and then cool-down. This is a good routine and you feel healthy afterward, not sore and tired like you can't do anything else with your day activity-wise.( I have felt that way with many workouts.)",1272585600,10,954,4.420454545454546
8361617,3,B002BKURIC,The title says you can Sit Down & Shape UP. I have back and leg problems I thought this was the video for me but a large amount of it is done standing.,1272499200,8,151,3.606060606060606
