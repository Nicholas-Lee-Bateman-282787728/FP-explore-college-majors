5577957,5,B00BCMSZWK,"Say what you will about the ""Schtick"" that Mel Brooks brings to the table.  It cannot be denied that he is an all-time great.  One of just a few people who have won  an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony award.  This personal look at Brooks is a wonderful trip down memory lane to take a look at all his classic films and a great insight to all the people who have helped make him a legend.  Highly recommended!",1373414400,,412,4.037037037037037

5577959,5,B00BCMSZWK,"5 STAR REVIEW OF ""MAKE A NOISE"" - MEL BROOKS
How I wish this amazing, insightful documentary about the life and career of Mel Brooks was available this semester when I taught ""Jew on Screen!""  The ancedotes are sprinkled with some painful and carefully edited comments by Brooks himself, a good deal of vintage comedy from most Brooks films and his television stint as a writer for Sid Caesar on ""Your Show of Shows.""  The comments of those with whom he directed and worked and played are truely touching.  I will definitely purchase a copy for screening the next time I teach this course.  Bravo -- as always -- to ""American Masters"" on PBS.",1369094400,5,642,4.605263157894737

5577974,5,B00BCMSZWK,"Mel Brooks is renowned as a comic genius, but hes much more.  The man is a survivor, a brave street fighter par excellence whos battled conformity, censorship and staid thinking.  Hes made jokes no one else would dare to, broken many boundaries and opened the doors for countless artists that followed his lead.  This documentary reveals an inquisitive, introspective legend that remains very much in touch with contemporary audiences.  If you're already a fan, youll become an even bigger fan after you savor this appreciation of a true great American icon.",1416096000,,558,5.0989010989010985

5577978,5,B00BCMSZWK,"First airing on PBS in May of 2013 as part of the AMERICAN MASTERS series, MEL BROOKS: MAKE A NOISE is a mix of interview and biography about and with one of the greatest comedy legends of American entertainment: Mel Brooks. I have been a fan of Brooks for much of my life and this is a special that I was really looking forward to watching and it didn't disappoint. Brooks influence in the entertainment world is without question. He is one of only about a dozen people who have won a competitive Emmy, Grammy, Tony, and Oscar. MAKE A NOISE follows his life from his early life to his initial success working as a writer for Sid Caesar's YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS and CAESAR'S HOUR through the massive success of the musical stage version of THE PRODUCERS.

The show largely consists of interviews with Brooks, but also features interviews with Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner, Richard Lewis, Tracey Ullman, Neil Simon, Joan Rivers, David Steinberg, Barry Levinson, Steve Weber, Cloris Leachman, David Lynch, Bill Pullman, Susan Stroman, and Matthew Broderick. Older interview footage from Gene Wilder and Madeline Kahn is also a part of the special. In addition there are a lot of clips from Brook's movies and TV shows.

I haven't seen many episodes of AMERICAN MASTERS so I don't really have any comparison how this particular special compares to others in the series. Personally, I found it highly enjoyable. Brooks is usually very tight-lipped nowadays when it comes to his marriage to Anne Bancroft. He talks about the relationship here a little, which is probably more than he's publicly talked about it in the past decade.

The only flaw with this special is that it's only 90 minutes long. Brooks has been involved in show business for over 7 decades. Therefore, although it touches on many aspects of Brooks' life, it isn't very detailed.

Overall, MEL BROOKS: MAKE A NOISE is a highly entertaining short biography of the American comedy legend Mel Brooks. It's a must see for anyone who is a fan of Brooks.",1407283200,2,2003,4.763688760806916

5578005,5,B00BCMSZWK,"This is a good presentation of The History Of Brooks, Part One. The other two parts are The AFI Tribute to Mel Brooks and The Original Cast Recording Of The Producers. Each of these three are different in form and each has unique content from the others; there is much to be enjoyed and learned in each.

Mel Brooks: Make A Noise is a documentary in interview and clip presentation form. First rate.
The AFI Tribute is in a roast-testimonial form. Lots of fun.
The Original Cast Recording is a vastly entertaining evening with Brooks as he energetically tells us the story of The Producers, from a sound studio's corridors and from the recording booth, in between the Broadway cast singing each of the show's songs; a true behind the scenes documentary recording of a "" happening "" that is the original cast album.",1377561600,2,814,4.652777777777778

8566047,4,B00BCMSZWK,"Bottom Line First
Were you to watch American Masters Mel Brooks Make a Noise; having no idea who Mel Brooks is or why you should care, you would come away entertained and motivated to seek out his movies. If you had closely followed his career, read some of what has been published and seen previous interviews and documentaries; Make a Noise is still entertaining and has some new info. It is neither definitive nor exhaustive. I would hope it is not the final. Mel Brooks retains his high energy and his professional friends their respect. My Recommendation: this is a must for Mel Brooks fans and fans of biography lite. Maybe not so much for film students or seekers for the real biography.

I enjoyed the Mel Brooks installment to the Public Television series American Masters. The combination of previous interviews and outtakes from the movies is a fairly standard technique, but the innovative technique was to interview Mel and may of his associates on an empty studio lot against a basic white screen. Camera gear and audio equipment are frequently visible.  Creativity need not be any more complex and the simplicity of staging created an immediate contrast with those of the Brooks Movies.

The adulatory interviews from this fellow writers and actors are like so many of these interviews, a canned predictability. It is rare for the people of the film and entertainment business to have less than glowing comments to say about successful members of their profession. If you listen closely you can pick up shade of what may be resentment over his tendency to dominate, if only by nervous energy almost any room he enters. Also clear from Mel and his associates is his tendency to push a joke too far.

There is an important other aspect to the otherwise usual comments from movie associates. His late wife, Anne Bancroft is quoted posthumously. They had shared a long and loving relationship. One of the things she makes known about Mel Brooks was that he was well read and a deeply thinking man. It is also reported that Mel had created an independent production company for her and though that company both Ms Bancroft and many another independent film maker found artistic outlets in major movie release.

Make a Noise is typical of the American Masters Series. It is adulatory and not very analytical.  It lacks in critical analysis. It is not part of the AM creed to add to the knowledge base by delving too deeply behind the official versions or to question the accepted outline of the selected Masters. It may be unfair to expect more from the producers of what is always a classy presentation. In the case of Mel Brooks, I hope he is worth at least one more effort to capture this very funny and creative American.",1478304000,,2734,4.757383966244726
