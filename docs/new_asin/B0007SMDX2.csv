8051143,4,B0007SMDX2,"My dying Bride at it's finest time! Nice price, good dvd authoring , video transfer of the main gig, the polish show, good, really it's like the original vhs tape first released years ago, multi-camera, great sound, perfect production! There are other 2 gigs  some kinda fan-crew recorded type. Finally the dynamo show it's great too, raw, rage sound, 2-3 cameras, not too much elaborated like the polish show, dying totally alive! The extra bonus include some pictures & artwork plus video clips just like the way it used to be around early 90's very cheap and bizarre produced, except for The Cry of Mankind with some performance feeling and For You that is very cool! If you like My Dying Bride first 3 albums you must get it! There a lot of repeated songs over the 3 gigs, but with different atmosphere if you wanna put it that way, and last but not for less a very blurr live version of Sear Me like in the first album!",1173657600,,924,4.4674556213017755
