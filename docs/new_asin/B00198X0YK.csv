3425683,4,B00198X0YK,"Leave It to Beaver has always been one of my favorite re-run shows to watch on TV, so I decided to buy some of the DVD season sets.  So far I've purchased seasons 1 through 4, and purchased them in order.  I loved the first two seasons.  By the third season, some of the humor was beginning to wear a little thin.  And now, by the fourth season, that is definitely the case.  Though I still like the show, I have begun to have some issues with how it is developing, or rather, not developing.

I guess the main problem I have with it is that Beaver (played by Jerry Mathers) has aged three years beyond the first season, but he's still acting like a ""dumb little kid"".  He has not progressed in maturity one iota.  Another thing, is that when I was growing up, I would simply not have anything to do with kids like Beaver, i.e., kids that lie to you, constantly get in trouble, fill you full of baloney, etc.  I only kept friends that I could rely upon.  Perhaps this would have been okay in some other kind of show or in a secondary character, but LITB is supposed to be one of those comedies that gives a humorous look at real family life.  I've also never liked kids that smelled.  His uncleanliness was funny the first two years, but now in the fourth season is not.  I therefore cannot identify with Beaver, but that is not the case with other characters on the show.  I still find it interesting, though, how the other characters play off of the Beaver character and his shenanigans.

Now for the other characters.  Beaver's mother June drives me batty.  I suppose Barbara Billingsley is just following the script, and she acts believably and well, but June has all the stereotypical mother qualities I dislkie, such as using the words ""cute"" and ""sweet"" in situations that drive the male of the species crazy.  She is totally clueless as to what little boys are like, and has the often typical female ""helpless"" persona about some thingsfor instance, she is unable to even change a light bulb.  When I do really like her character is when she uses the subtle indirect approach to get Beaver or Wally to do the right thing, and she does dote on her kids, which is a quality trait.  I suppose June is sort of a product of her era.  If LITB were being filmed today, I'm sure the June character would be a little more assertive.  I have to think that Barbara sometimes cringed inside with some of the things she had to speak or act out in the role.

I like the father Ward.  Hugh Beaumont does a fine job with his character.  This is kind of curious, though, because when I was a kid, I didn't like the Ward character so much.  I thought he was a bit too strict and authoritative.  Still, when he accepts Beaver's promise that he will ""never do anything like that again"", I want to drill some sense into the guy.  And why is he so clumsy in a kitchen?  Everybody has a certain level of expertise in the kitchen, but he has absolutely none.  Still, I do find that lack of expertise funny, even though it is as much a stereotype as June's light bulb aversion.

Wally is my favorite of the main characters.  Tony Dow really does a fine job in his role.  I have no quibbles about his character at all.  I generally find the Wally character the most humorous of the main characters, and wish it was the main character.  I can identify with this guy.  Every now and then, there is a scene where Tony Dow is just barely able to keep a straight face, or maybe not, as the situation is so ridiculously funny.  I treasure those.

Now for the lesser characters.  First off, the ones no longer in the show.  I really miss Larry, acted by Rusty Stevens.  He was even a worse kid than Beaver, but for some reason I liked him better.  His facial expressions were sometimes the funniest of any of the regular characters.  I understand he was let go because of issues with his real life mother.  I'm not sure who acted as his mother on the show, but she was a real trip.  She was even more helpless than June Cleaver, but I found her hilarious, not frustrating.  I also miss Judy Hensler.  I don't know why she was replaced with another character.  She was so perfectly obnoxious in her role.  Perhaps she was maturing too fast.  I also miss the little boy Benjie across the street who eats snails, even though he was supposedly only in three episodes.  I think he was probably dropped because at his age, he would have aged too much in a year or two for the type of little kid humor he provided.

I like the Eddie Haskell character, played by Ken Osmond, better now than I did in the first two seasons.  Unlike Beaver, the writers and directors have allowed him to mature and develop.  Now we sometimes see glimpses of what Wally must see in him.  After all, there must be some reason Wally keeps him as his best friend, because Eddie is usually a real ""creep"".

The Whitey character is also very funny.  I like the way he has of smiling after he says something perhaps a little awkwardly or stupid, or when the teacher is pleased with him about something.

Gus, played by Burt Mustin, the fireman at the reserve fire station, is a great character I'd like to see more of.  I like the way he always pays attention to Beaver, whereas most adults would probably just want Beaver to get out of their hair.  Gus only appeared in fifteen episodes total through 1962, but I guess they couldn't have the Cleaver kids spending that much time down at a fire station.

In conclusion, I still find the series enjoyable to watch, and it is good family entertainment, something that does not really exist anymore on today's television.  Beaver does need to grow up a little bit.  When I get season 5 on DVD, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised in that regard.  Sometimes I get tired of the weekly lessons the show tries to teach, but then, that is probably a good quality for a show to provide for much younger viewers.  All things considered, you can't go wrong with buying this DVD, unless you are looking to get your periodic doses of vulgarity and other forms of ""adult"" humor.",1427760000,,6054,4.381850853548967

I live in the UK and purchased Season 3,4 and 5 to be delivered to my mother-in-law's in Iowa last summer where we would pick them up when we visited. I picked them up in August. Last night we finally started to watch Season 4 and discovered Disc 1 missing. In its place was a duplicate Disc 3. Amazon will not refund or replace as it is past the 30 day period. They gave me a $5 voucher. Whoopee. So, the moral of the story is if you buy a lot of DVDs check them all as soon as you get them and don't wait to open them when you decide to finally get around to watching them.",1326240000,,660,3.9328358208955225

wearing thin. However, there is STILL enough reasons evident to want to own
this season.

Plenty of laughs to enjoy, and perhaps the best reason....the nostalgic
view of those times gone by, the late 1950's and early 1960's.
