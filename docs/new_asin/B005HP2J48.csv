4702667,2,B005HP2J48,I spent the entire film waiting and waiting and still waiting for the plot to pick up! Very slow moving and did not like the adult characters. I felt like I wasted an hour and a half of my time.,1372550400,2,194,3.875
4702668,5,B005HP2J48,"Through its simple authenticity, The Tree powerfully explores family dynamics, love and loss. The performances are nothing short of sincere and moving. I expected this to be typically sad considering the issues it deals with but instead it concentrates on deeper issues such as family, the mystery of death, love, and loyalty.",1366761600,3,326,5.288461538461538
4702669,5,B005HP2J48,"The actual tree in this film is impressive.  The Swiss Family Robinson could not have found a better tree! The cinematography is gorgeous.  The 8 year old daughter is an old soul who steals the film.  The mother, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, is a character we see grow and develop 180 degrees from dysfunctional grieving spouse and mother of 4 children, to branching out and obtaining her first job, to dating again with all the complexities of being a single mother, to ultimately dealing with a calamity that I will not reveal further...

I loved this understated gem.  Just roll with it.  What's the harm in having such an incredible magnificent giant of a tree also be one of the main characters?  I never got tired of seeing that tree or how each member of the family interacted with it.",1356307200,15,795,4.635714285714286
4702670,5,B005HP2J48,"You should definitely not watch the trailer if you can avoid it because I think it gives you a different idea of what the movie is about than what it really is.
The characters seem sad and confused and there is a general inability to cope with their life situation. That's just my take, and how I feel about the people being portrayed in this situation. To me, the only endearing character gets shuffled off for no comprehensible reason, for his efforts.
Of course the acting is all top notch, so it is not about them, it is the story and the state of mind people go into because of catastrophes. I can relate to that having lived through a very devastating hurricane in South Florida, how you can go into a sort of malaise in the midst of what seems like ruin that has to be permanent. Well, it isn't and you just deal with it.",1356048000,2,828,4.280254777070064
4702671,2,B005HP2J48,"On the positive side was the great acting job by ""the tree"". Best tree since the African Baobab found it's way into many books and films. Tree rates with other famous movie trees - Lord of the Rings, Poltergeist, Wizard of Oz, Evil Dead and Avatar. Second positive goes to the acting of the tree's imaginative admirer, young Morgana Davies as Simone.

On the negative side was the not so interesting portrayals by the rest of the acting crew - just OK, straight forward obvious acting.
Script and direction was simply disjointed; jumping from dad dying from heart attack to the family coping in an unemotional and unbelievable manner to a weak as well as predictable attempt to save the tree to the tree predictably falling in a wind storm.

The main theme of Simone, believing that her dad is speaking to her through the tree, just didn't seem magical or fantastic or real or anything. Just a girl sitting in a tree talking to herself with the wind causing the tree to creak. The various interplays between her and her brothers and mom also didn't seem either real or profound. They didn't feel like a family. The mom's interest in another male (like a cheap paperback romance novel) and his interaction with the children just drew a blank reaction from this viewer's perspective - like what's the point of this part of the story. Mom's role and behavior both during her depressive phase and in caring for the children also didn't appear to be realistic. The movie's ending with the family just driving off seemed as anticlimactic as the storyline.",1324252800,10,1549,4.712177121771218

After 1 hour and 10 minutes of nearly no movement in the story line, they decided to move it along.

4702730,5,B005HP2J48,"I must admit first off that I am a huge fan of Charlotte Gainsbourg and that very likely colored my view. Celebrity crush aside, she puts in an excellent performance as a newly widowed mother who is overwhelmed in her grief and expected burden of single parenthood to a parcel of children. Her character's arc in this is played out with exquisite nuance and empathy. She carries this film very well.

Helping her out are fantastic performances by the youths playing her four children. If only child actors were always this good. In particular, Morgana Davies, who is by all rights the co-star of the film, plays her character with an impressive balance of little girl toughness and vulnerability. We learn about her relationship with her father far more by her relationship with the titular tree than her interactions with the actual character for the short time he's in the film.

The location is gorgeous, showing off a very beautiful area of Australia that is almost a character in itself. Be warned, though, that this is a slice-of-life drama, small in scope, but big in emotion. If that sounds boring to you, it will be. Otherwise, this is a film with a surprisingly hopeful and bright message, despite its main theme being grief, without being saccharine or hammering you over the head with it. I was very satisfied and would like to see more like this.",1462838400,10,1359,4.754237288135593

4702741,3,B005HP2J48,"This is the second feature film by director Julie Bertuccelli, whose featurefkilm debut was a touching drama ""Since Otar Left."" It took about seven years for the director to make another feature film, a French-Australian production ""The Tree."" Based on Judy Pascoe's book ""Our Father Who Art in The Tree,"" her sophomore feature follows the story of a family the O'Neil's living in a small Australian country town. Everything of their peaceful life changes when their father Peter (Aden Young) suddenly dies, leaving his wife Dawn (Charlotte Gainsbourg) shocked and devastated.

But one of their children, 8-year-old daughter Simone (Morgana Davies), believes that their father still dwells in the huge tree in the backyard. And it seems her strong belief is not entirely groundless as the tree is an unusual one, full of life, as if encroaching into their house.

The film's half-allegorical story is based on an interesting premise about the tree that triggers the mother-daughter conflict. Things get melodramatic when a male character enters: George Elrick (Marton Csokas), Dawn's employer who is romantically attracted to Dawn. Csokas and Gainsbourg did fine jobs, and so did the tree of the title, integral part of the film.

Unfortunately the film in its final act drops the ball in its handling of the narrative, not knowing what story to tell. That the metaphor (if any) of the tree is open to interpretation is fine with me. But the film's weak conclusion is something else. The story about Dawn's conflict and Simone's pains is resolved in a neat but convenient way. In fact, Simone is virtually forgotten at the end as if the director does not know what to do with the character.

See for then 7-year-old amazing Morgana Davies, whose complicated character is much more interesting than the overwrought symbolism of the beautifully-shot but somewhat unfocused film.",1373587200,8,1876,5.120915032679738

Charlotte Gainsbourg is a wonderful actress, and I won't give away the ending but the feminist elements of the film moved me deeply, and made me stand proud thinking of my own mother and the lengths she'd go to for the hearts of her children.
