There is far more to a rendezvous than that. So I was very disappointed in having to watch that long of a video only covering that one event. I would not buy this video!!!!",1247356800,4,339,4.483870967741935
8104801,1,B000E372FE,"In purchasing this video, I thought I was purchasing a video of a complete Rendezvous segment because of the price.  I was fooled.  Not much information for the elevated price that you pay.  My only review is that it is totally not worth the money.",1153785600,4,248,4.466666666666667
