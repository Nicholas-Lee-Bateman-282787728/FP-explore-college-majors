2614613,2,B000GIXLLG,"While it was pretty interesting to see the excitement on the astronomer's faces as they did their work, I felt the video did not really frame well what they were trying to do.  It wasn't really until the end that they brought up why this was such a big idea and what its implications were for the universe.  So while not a terrible video, I fault it for failing to capture the imagination, the wonder, absolute hugeness (made up word) of this notion of an accelerating universe.",1229817600,4,478,4.482758620689655
2614614,5,B000GIXLLG,"This program is a few years old now, but the gist of it remains true.  We live in a time when astronomers are coming to terms with the fact that we simply do not know the nature of most of the material in the Universe.  The show tells the story of how astronomers use supernovae to determine the rate of expansion of the Universe, and whether it will continue forever.  The people involved are the best in the business, and most of them are engaging and even fun to watch.  I've used this show many times in an astronomy class for non-scientists and they love it.",1175731200,7,563,4.283018867924528

2614616,5,B000GIXLLG,"Before Albert Einstein died, he expressed a belief that there was a mysterious energy in the universe that held it together, yet couldn't be seen.  He had no proof.  In time, however, he came to believe that this thought was a blunder on his part.  Now, as it turns out, he may have been right after all.  This mysterious energy is known as Dark Energy and certain scientists believe that it occupies at least two-thirds of the known universe with Dark Matter filling most of the last third.  Matter, as we know it, only occupies about five percent of the universe.  This is part of what the NOVA espisode, Runaway Universe, deals with.  There's also the race between two rival astronomy teams, each seeking to find evidence which shows that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down, but rather speeding up.  Each team is able to gather the necessary proof for this new theory by observing certain types of exploding stars and the expanding heat and gases that erupt from them.  Ten years ago, it seems that almost everyone thought the universe was going to stop expanding and that all the galaxies would eventually be drawn together for a gigantic implosion.  Now, it looks as though that particular theory was wrong.  What is the force that's causing the universe's expansion to accelerate?  This is where the theory of Dark Energy may come into play.  A number of today's scientists believe that Dark Engergy counteracts gravity.  Rather than gravity pulling all of the galaxies together into one massive clump, Dark Energy may be keeping them apart while at the same time propelling them forward through infinite space and time.  As well as discussing these new ideas, the Runaway Universe also has some breathtaking imagery of super novas and gaseous nebulae and spiral galaxies that were taken by the Hubble Space telecope and a much newer scope that enables scientists to see futher into darkness of our universe.  If only I was eighteen years old, instead of fifty-six.  The next fifty years are going to be astounding for astronomers as new knowledge and insight comes about, especially when we finally put a man on Mars.  I wish I could be here for that moment.",1171670400,37,2180,4.783422459893048
2614617,5,B000GIXLLG,"Excellent content. The visuals that take you from our Solar System, out of our Galaxy, out of our local group and then out of our super cluster are stunning. It gives you a real sense of where we live. I purchased this after seeing it on PBS. This is one I can watch many times. Gives strong evidence for the possible acceleration in the expansion of our universe.",996105600,17,364,4.367647058823529

8133147,1,B000GIXLLG,"My problem with this DVD is there is no CLOSED CAPTIONING.  I am hard of hearing and need that feature.  Whenever a DVD's menu says to me ""Oh, you want closed captioning?  Just turn it on using your TV's remote control""  I know I'm screwed.  I have about a 4-year old wide, flat-screen Sanyo TV.  Its various menu options do not display when a DVD is playing.  On the TV, CC is always turned on because I need that.  So there is no way to activate the advertised closed captioning on this DVD.",1432339200,2,493,4.225806451612903

8133150,5,B000GIXLLG,NOVA: Runaway Universe  a visual story on these poor  scared astronomer  people who don't grasp the concept of god as they keep making the same statement on how lonely life is  because the universe is expanding  farther  away every second and it means that planetsd  are to far away to meet terrestial life. -owens,1400716800,,314,4.703703703703703
8133151,5,B000GIXLLG,"Astronomers and physicists knew the universe was expanding but were actually quite alarmed to discover (by accident too) that the universe is ""speeding up"" its expansion rather than slowing down as they originally thought it should. The universe and even the galaxies we see are expanding faster than the speed of light away from us.

Let me digress and share some thoughts as I ponder this. What I found interesting about these facts is something not even discussed in the video. If ""life"" exists on any one of the billions of ""known"" galaxies, we will never know about their existence since those galaxies are already moving away from us faster than the speed of light. Our discoveries will have to be confined to our own galaxy (maybe the Andromeda since it is on a collision course for us).

The thought that one day the night skies will be completely black, no stars in sight is quite a lonely thought. Questions I have is will this expansion continue forever or will it rip and collapse the universe like a pin does to a bubble? Once the energy and fuel are used up by all the galaxies of stars, supernova, pulsars, than we will have truly a universe of ""nothing"". The old question ""why is there something rather than nothing"" seems to be answered by the notion that soon we will have nothing instead of something. Than it could be more appropriately asked, ""Why is there nothing instead of something"".

This video really gets you thinking. I applaud the many astronomers that worked on this video.",1308528000,,1504,4.6893939393939394
8133152,4,B000GIXLLG,"Runaway Universe (2000) was a was very interesting four star DVD.  It discussed the reasons astronomers are trying to determine just what dark matter and dark energy really are.  After watching this DVD I was fairly certain these may as well be called virtual matter and virtual energy because we can't directly see either one and have only coined these terms as an ""ad-hoc"" way of explaining the observed motions of everything visible in the universe.

Excuse me for being a little disappointed (not in the DVD, but in the state of our understanding), but the search for dark matter sounds to me like the outdated search for ""the ether"", a prior ""virtual medium"" believed to occupy all space and through which light waves were believed to travel just as sound travels through the air. To quote my old physics professor, ""ether there is, or there isn't"".  Observations and Einstein have proven the ether to be a fiction. There is no ether, no ether drag, and I am not certain there is dark matter or energy as well.

Still, we search for the presence of dark matter and the even more mysterious dark energy. Dark matter is currently used to explain the vast majority of the gravitating matter that we can't see (invisible!), which in turn is used to rationalize the observed motion of galaxies (and the like) which Newton's laws (with modification for Einstein's laws) require to work.  There are other effects like gravitational lensing which have been assumed to be due to dark matter.  Still, we have yet to directly observe dark matter.  See Wikipedia for better explinations of dark matter and energy.

More mysterious, dark energy (or vacuum energy) permeating all of space would be used to explain the currently observed accelerating expansion of the universe.  Now I love Einstein as much as the next guy, but everyone quotes Einstein's cosmological constant as being ""correct"", or at least on the correct track. As physicists admit, the cosmological constant was a fudge factor computed to result in a static universe, and not an expanding one. It provided an anti-gravity type force which was mathematically assumed to permeate all space and provide the necessary repulsive force to produce (Einstein's assumed) static universe against the attracting force of gravity. Einstein was the first to admit that he had no idea what the cosmological constant was.

Einstein was correct to say this was his ""biggest blunder"" when Hubble observed the red shift and an actually expanding universe.  Nothing succeeds like success, and astronomers now say Einstein's blunder was actually one of his biggest successes. True, it provided a repulsive force assumed to occupy all space, and simply not large enough in magnitude to produce the measured acceleration of the universe.  But we have just replaced one unknown with another.  All that really seems to exist are our steadily improving measurements, and our growing comprehension of how much we don't fully understand. There are competing theories but we need more Hubble observations, experiments with particle accelerators and much more basic research. There is still the Pioneer X anomaly to be reckoned with and many other space based observations and anomalies (just as soon as the recession is over).

The latest findings on dark matter and energy should be available on the web.",1249603200,4,3337,5.041818181818182
8133153,5,B000GIXLLG,"In the mid-80's Hawking announced that science was nearly over:
that we had discovered everything and made math of it.
The astrophysics people in testing if the universe was slowing down, using type one supernovas as mile posts, found that the universe was actually accelerating in the expansion that they measured by red shifts.
Probably one of the most important discoveries of recent time
and since we haven't a clue what kind of energy exactly dark energy is
or what much of the dark matter is like,
it will involve new mathematics as well.",1236902400,2,544,4.797872340425532
