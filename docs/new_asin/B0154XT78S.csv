7428838,2,B0154XT78S,"My expectations from this video were really high. I am a little disappointed. This is not a concert video. Nothing to do with the old christmas live concert from 1997 which will still be my favourite christmas concert of all times.

I would have loved to watch the original Mannheim Steamroller members playing the music (Chip Davis on the drums, Jackson Berkey on the keyboards, Arnie Roth on the violin, Almeda Berkey, Chuck Penington and the others).

However, the video quality is the only valuable aspect of this release. This is by no means a christmas concert.",1446595200,19,567,4.835051546391752
7428839,5,B0154XT78S,I really enjoyed this Blu-ray. The commentary supplied by Chip Davis was very interesting. I highly recommend this disk to any Mannheim Steamroller fan. The sound is great in the blu-ray format. There is also some Fresh Aire thrown in the mix.,1445990400,3,243,4.809523809523809
7428840,1,B0154XT78S,"This is not a regular concert recording. Each song has talking about the song between tracks and it also interferes with the beginning of the songs. Also there is no control of each track, only each section. When I buy a concert DVD I want to listen to a concert uninterrupted not one with talking about stuff that should be put in the extra section. Also I like to be able to go to what track I want without fast forwarding to it.  This was a wast of money and I do not recommend it at all.",1445904000,22,491,4.061855670103093
7428841,5,B0154XT78S,I was there for this live concert one of the nights. This was delightful to watch the video of what I actually saw. Love Mannheim Steamroller and can keep reliving the concert.,1485820800,,176,4.53125

7428846,5,B0154XT78S,This is the most enjoyable Manheim video that I've seen . Performances are stellar as always And really enjoyed the interviews and the back stories. Chips kids are excellent absolutely loved green sleeves.  And Chip if you're reading this the reason this is lasting so long is because no one has ever  arranged Christmas music as well as you have an addition to the instrumentation is which is just an absolutely perfect marriage modern and traditional this is just wonderful,1481414400,,475,4.925
7428847,5,B0154XT78S,this group is fantastic!,1481241600,,24,5.25
7428848,5,B0154XT78S,I hesitated buying this after reading some of the other reviews but I am so glad I purchased this. I just watched it and I really enjoyed this dvd. It's not a concert but a  biography of Chip Davis (Mannheim Steamroller). They do show some clips of concerts(most of them Christmas music) that is really enjoyable. To me Manheim Steamroller has the best Christmas music and I wish they would come out with a new blue ray dvd of them doing a Christmas concert. I have no regrets buying this and will be watching it again.,1480464000,,519,4.40625
7428849,5,B0154XT78S,Wish I could give this group more stars. An interesting documentary and music. It's not a concert. It's an in depth visit with a great group.,1477008000,,141,4.461538461538462

7428858,3,B0154XT78S,So so.  Wasn't as good as I hoped.  More of an interview with Chip Davis than a concert.,1453766400,,88,3.8333333333333335

7428861,5,B0154XT78S,"I bought the Mannheim Steamroller Live Blu-Ray for my husband as a gift.  He really enjoyed that it is so much more than a concert DVD, it includes story footage and history of the Mannheim Steamroller group.",1452038400,2,208,4.621621621621622
7428865,2,B0154XT78S,"I received this CD/DVD set as a Christmas gift. I gave this two stars because while it is of exceptional production quality, it is billed as a live concert DVD and it is NOT a concert DVD. It is a behind the scenes story of Chip Davis and the creation of the Mannheim Steamroller Christmas phenomena (Mostly about Chip Davis. You learn little about the band members or the music.) I would have added a star simply if the bonus track songs were the  DVD ""concert"" and the Play content was the bonus material. I was surprised to read the reviews this morning and learn of the tie in to PBS, which makes sense of the tracking.",1451088000,,623,4.3247863247863245
7428866,4,B0154XT78S,"I liked this DVD (I got the DVD  version)  and I think Manheim Steamroller fans will too IF they know the back story of the project and what is and what isn't here. Ill try to explain in this review.
Chip Davis (a musician/composer/singer) was part of the band, C.W. Mc Call who had a novelty hit single  Convoy  in 1975. But hes best remembered by the classical/rock band he created in Omaha Nebraska 40 years ago: Manheim Steamroller. The first album was Fresh Aire and there were sequels. In 1985 MS recorded a Christmas Album which you still hear every holiday season. There is a MS Christmas DVD out there too. But this is not that.

In 2014 Davis recorded a Christmas Concert at the huge Orpheum Theater in Omaha and used thatr for the basis of this documentary. Davis used to play in the MS concerts but now he has TWO touring bands and concerns himself with production. We learn all this in the intros that he gives here  filmed at his studio and farm (he raises wolves!)  Those who know MS only for the music will find out more about Davis (and his 2 daughters and son- obviously he is no longer married). This is all fine.

BUT, the project was obviously really produced to sell to Public TV at pledge break time. The 57 minute program is divided into 3 20 minute segments  with the title inserted at each break. This means that you cannot go directly to a song. (So, how hard would it have been to re-index the DVD for home sales). And, as with many sell as a pledge premium DVDs, there are additional performances not seen on TV. In this case its 5 songs lasting 20 minutes. At least THESE can be watched as individual performances.

The third marketing idea that I think was wrong was that the concert is partly Christmas songs and partly the MS classics  good all year round. By including so much Christmas music (and not using the word Christmas in the title or package design, they are misleading the buyer and limiting the sales to seasonal sales.  A better choice would be to produce a full concert DVD  of nearly all non-holiday music , index it into individual tracks, and put Davis comments on the DVD or BD as bonuses that you could watch once.

So  despite all the things I think Davis could have done better  I did learn a lot from his comments. But I probably won't watch this DVD again.
There is some good news though. There is a companion CD of just the music and it is in individual tracks. The downside, however, is that most (if not all, of these songs are on other MS albums that most fans will already have.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7428867,1,B0154XT78S,I would not recommend this to anyone. The music selection is poor with songs I've never even heard of.  I'm trying to return this which I wouldn't waste my time watching and it's not easy. While I'm at it I learned my lesson purchasing music which I do quite often. Do Not Select Save In Library because then you can't download it so it really still belongs to Amazon.,1450483200,,368,4.333333333333333
