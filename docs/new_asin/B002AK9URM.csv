3884185,4,B002AK9URM,"This is one of the scariest films I've seen in a long time and I can't put my finger on just why it affected me to the point that I had to put it on PAUSE to catch my breath. First of all, I've seen a lot of scary, hellish, fiendish movies, but the fact that this movie depicted what could occur in real life is what hit me to the core. Was it the way it was filmed? As always, Jim Caviezal is a gifted actor no matter what part he plays and that added to the real-life drama of the film.  There is nothing to ""get."" It is the story of a couple trying to resurrect their failing marriage in an environment that requires both trust and teamwork, clearly two traits they both lacked. The title of the movie is ridiculous because it really doesn't have anything to do with how NATURE attacks people for being careless, but more how careless people attack each other when put in a primitive environment. This was clearly a movie on how ""civilized"" man can turn quite uncivilized when fear takes over--even our modern day ""saviours"" such as the cell phone and GPS cannot always save us...especially from ourselves. A very disturbing little film...and yes, I wondered about fate of the dog too.",1252627200,43,1188,4.375565610859729
3884186,5,B002AK9URM,"This is not your typical suspense thriller movie and I for one can appreciate that and enjoy that alone.  The cinemotography was outstanding, that in itself is worth viewing.  I like the dialogue as well as the strained relationship that was exhibited throughout.  There were some subtleness but it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what was happening.  This movie thoroughly entertained myself (50ish female) and my husband a huge special/sound effects, action packed non-stop kind a guy.",1252368000,60,500,5.2125
3884187,5,B002AK9URM,"I give this film 5 stars not because it compares with ""2001"" but because it gave me a lot more than I was expecting. There are portions of the film when I was glued to the screen and thinking ""Wow! This movie really turned out OK!"" If you're like me and you loathe people that crap on Mother Nature,then I HIGHLY recommend this film! Let's call it ""Mother Natures' Revenge"" with some Twilight Zone fun thrown in! See it! (I'm 55 years old and a lifelong film fan)",1250553600,3,463,4.2727272727272725
3884188,2,B002AK9URM,"I ordered this since Caviezel was popular again with the Outlander success, and Screen Media has had two hits of late with Bustin Down the Door and An American Affair. Guess there has to be a miss sooner or later - this would be the miss.

The story follows an unhappily married couple as they venture to a secluded northern Australia beach to camp and relax. They also bring a dog (relevant to the atrocious writing at the end). Whilst they camp and plod around, they talk, do stupid things to nature, argue and become fearful of the animals surrounding them. That about sums it up. The writing was hilarious at times, even though this is a suspense movie. For instance, our guy becomes upset because his lady trashes an eagle egg, but it was ok for him to execute a sea lion the scene before, whatever. There is also this plague of bad lighting throughout the entire film during each night shot.

The scenery is beautiful, and the film stock was good. The sound is average and the DVD is bare bones with some bizarre cover art. One last little gripe, when you select the Play option from the menu, that should not include making you watch the trailers before the film starts. SPOILERS: I screened it with customers and they all caught the same thing at the end with the dog - coupled with what was already a lame ending, they will not be recommending the film, oh well.",1249171200,4,1371,4.45816733067729

3884190,1,B002AK9URM,"I gave it one star because Jim Caviezel  is nice Looking, so that was a plus, for this turkey of a movie, and well I loved seeing wild areas, in Australia.  This loser movie had no plot to speak of, IMHO.  I mean so what, if we saw a few native nasty critters, like a really creepy spider, minding it's own business, and some slithering snakes, hanging out,  and some pesky ants, where they were supposed to be.  This couple is on a camping trip by the ocean,  I guess to save their marriage, but He is a juvenile and She is a real drag and a major whiner, so you are left wondering how these two ended up together in the first place.  I have seen some low budget movies, I have actually liked, but this one?... Well I guess if you're really bored and want to kill some time,  I guess this flick would be better than staring at your device's wallpaper.",1498435200,,852,4.152439024390244

3884193,5,B002AK9URM,"How do we regard the natural world. Just how much is Mother Nature willing to take?
The couple in this movie are not even aware of how their anger toward each other is

in this portrayal of nature fighting back.",1494806400,,376,4.611940298507463

3884196,1,B002AK9URM,"Another lousy misdirection flick where the set up is one story and the actual plot, another. Two callous people seem to be wrecking havoc on ""Mother Nature"" in what the audience is led to believe is a nature's revenge flick. Instead we are treated to a angry, drunken husband violently berating his wife over her abortion. Plenty of animal slaughter, but also mysterious arrows that fly out of nowhere, ""suspiciously"" moldy food, and lingering landscape shots that are meant to connote dread. That's as exciting as it gets, folks. As big a miss as those unexplained arrows.",1491264000,3,573,4.917525773195877
3884197,4,B002AK9URM,"This was a good re-make of the 70's film from down under called ""Long Weekend"". Most reviewers on here wouldn't know that because from the sound of it they 1) aren't fans of horror films let alone lost gems from the 70's and 2) can't resist the temptation of blathering off in the form of a ""review"" before they're even done watching the thing. That being said you don't necessarily have to be a fan of the original film to enjoy this. This one's pretty close to the original except for the additional dead bodies found and the gore at the very end. If you like horror films that are a little more psychological with a slower build-up then you'll like this. Simple enough plot: A couple who isn't getting along goes away on a camping trip and proceeds to abuse the wilderness around them. Nature ""strikes back"" in the form of animals having their say of the situation but how much of it is in their minds from all the tension between themselves?",1491004800,3,945,4.436781609195402

3884199,5,B002AK9URM,"Wow, what a great movie.  It is so scary but without anything too scary.  I have been in the beautiful outdoors alot when younger, and these creepy dead things where all around me.  Even dead seals and whales, and birds.  Then you start to freak out and just start running and slashing and smashing all in your path to get away.  This movie is like that.

Neither character has endearing qualities that would cause the viewer to have empathy for either of them.  Apparently she had an affair and had an abortion and has become frigid.  He has big issues after apparently having had an affair himself.  The only lovable creatures in the film are the dog and the poor sea creature that macho man shot.  There is another family at the remote area that seems to have been murdered.  Both the man and wife met their demise in bizarre circumstances.  This leaves a person wondering what happened to the poor sea creature left crawling about severely wounded and the poor dog who did not ask to be owned by this couple.,1484179200,4,833,4.4144736842105265

But from the first few minutes listening to these two foul-mouthed husband and wife duo, I wonder how they stayed married this long. There is much suspense and mystery throughout the movie which kept my interest. There is the typical relationship struggles between husband and wife but a dark secret is revealed that explains the source of their animosity towards one another. They are not very kind to their surroundings either. Other characters in the movie do not fit in very well with the story and are unexplained. Overall, the movie was okay. There are some lessons to be learned from this movie such as all life is important and to be valued and respected including your environment and nature.

The female lead in the movie is really unlikable...pushing the male lead character away and then getting scared and running and screaming for him.  It got pretty predictable and annoying, I can't stand a wussy woman.  I honestly thought this would be more of a creature type movie and it wasn't.  So I was a bit disappointed on that.

Instead, none of this happened. If the truth be told, the most entertaining part of the movie was watching the couple quarrel, which they did basically the entire film. Speaking of which, I wonder was it the invisible dark force of the wilderness that made Carla and Peter more bitter towards one another or were they bound to attack each other regardless of the environment?

That is not the case. Nature is the backdrop, and these two unlikable characters are the centerpiece. With a disintegrating marriage, they take a camping trip, with him eager for the trip and her reluctant and wishing for a hotel. The rest of the movie is about their conflict and essentially nature just reflects the characters' own darkness back upon them.

I watched it and it did not seem like horror as much as a film about a couple's relationship that is violently on its last legs. But then came the message. Almost like nature or environment against human destruction of seals, eagle eggs, and disturbing the natural balance of life. It is some movie that came out of left field and probably forgotten but which sticks with you long after the final credits roll.

Peter was plain nasty; in turn, she was just a B***** towards Peter, but we don't know why. Not sure if knowing why really mattered except that they did get into a really heavy shouting match about ""it."" So, whatever their case, they deserved each other, which was evident early on in the movie. Cricket, Peter's, Border Collie, must have perished, which really saddened me; however, we don't know for sure. Considering the kind of movie it is--horror, there should have been some closure for Cricket. I love the horror in this movie compared to the zombie movies; just not a zombie fan at all. Had the filming been more professional, such as, the window on the camera lens filmed the water spots while Peter was swimming in the ocean. And, the underwater experience of finding dead bodies was a bit on the humorous end and that broke the intensity of that feeling of fear that we were supposed to feel. Also, it might have been better had she opened her eyes while Peter was looking at her instead of later. That scene seemed out-of-place. But, whatever happened to Cricket? This is a movie about the horror of the mind and what it will do to you. I never did really think it was about Nature coming alive.

3884738,3,B002AK9URM,"I've always appreciated Jim Caviezel after playing Christ in The Passion. I'll give him credit for playing in this disturbing role. This is the complete opposite for him. I gave it 3 stars because the situation itself is terrifying but it could have been produced way better. Don't get me wrong, this is considered a horror movie and it definitely is. Think, your marriage is on the edge, you end up in a terrible environment that only causes more tension since she hates camping, she wants to leave, at the same time you don't know how to get home, nature is attacking you, your dog wanders and gets lost repeatedly, and there's a dugong stalking you up the beach. This is the exact opposite of that show Naked and Afraid. Pure hatred along with nature messing with your head. How couldn't that be more terrifying?

However...there are those few awkward scenes that simply are there just because...you know it has to have some form of a sexual healing. It's unexpected but more in the sense of, ""oh, okay. Guess this is happening. Hmm"".  Also it's way to emotional in the sense that it focuses on the already troubled marriage. It's called natures grave, I expected more killer nature. It should really be called, ""Nature: Marriage Reckoning"" or ""Nature you Suck: Spouse Edition!"" and played on sci-fi channel. I'd watch this again but probably in the form of a drinking game.

Hope this helps, don't expect it to be an academy award winner. There's hits and misses: This hit the backboard but missed the hoop completely.",1449705600,,1522,4.735849056603773

3884813,2,B002AK9URM,"Not what I expected.  Just a relationship picture with a couple trying to fix their failing marriage.  He wants to go camping.  She doesn't like camping but makes the effort for the sake of their marriage.  Much of the movie is them arguing.  This one is trying to be nice and that one is being hateful then that one is being nice and this one is hateful.  Back and forth.  He eventually loses it for no apparent reason.  I guess it's supposed to be creepy with him in denial and her wanting to go home.  Having spent many a night tent camping in the middle of nowhere, I found very little creepy here.  Nothing much really strange happens with nature.  Nature does not rise up against them.  Just a few odd incidents that are unusual, but have happened to people in real life.  (Ever have a bird dive bomb your head or a bunch of ants climb up your leg?)  The only strange thing is the sea cow and that just doesn't make any sense.  I endured the entire movie waiting for things to escalate and for something exciting to happen, but it never does.  Well, I did enjoy the very end.  After all, the guy was pretty much a jerk.  Felt sorry for that poor truck driver though.

This is a place where EVERYTHING that lasts longer, than just passing through or by on the roadway, has come to die. Their marriage, the Manatee, the birds, the baby Manatee, their camping neighbors, EVERYTHING in nature comes there to die, whether it's by the hands of a husband or suicide, or just plain out and out murder, EVERYTHING here has come to die.
That being said, Jim Caviezel portrays a husband who wants to breathe some life into his dying relationship, and the Mrs., well she's just wanting for it to be over, go back, and go their own separate ways. Claudia Karvan has a lackluster performance in this film, and seems to not even want to be on the set for the movie. Understanding this gives Jim a stellar performance, and my kudos for finishing strongly, even to the point of almost getting away from that area.

Scenes are not well connected and it leaves you with more questions than answers.  The dog, Cricket, is the best character in the movie, and Peter (his owner who is so concerned about the dog for the entire movie) abandons Cricket to escape the area (so, it leaves you to believe that the dog dies alone) - overall, just a weird movie that does not have any value, and I am sorry that I watched it, because I can't get some of the scenes out of my mind.",1437955200,10,718,4.107142857142857

I like the helplessness that you are forced under; despite being armed, you still can't escape. But here's where the problem arises, and it's a big one: nobody wants a horror flick where you WANT the characters to die. It's not that Peter is a prick; in fact, he seems perfectly relatable and decent, but his grumpy wrinkling-past-her-prime Missus puts a serious drag on the film. I mean, for the love of Gawd woman, will you please just let your greying hair down for ONCE and try to have a good time??? The endless b*tching and moaning from this character literally ruins the entire horror experience, since I'm sure that within the first fifteen minutes, somebody in the audience would rather slash her throat themselves to shut her up already. She doesn't like camping, she doesn't like dogs, hates guns, doesn't want to be anywhere but in a 5 star hotel, and otherwise exists solely to make a man miserable. I must give kudos to the actress for playing her part convincely, but from a direction standpoint, I would have enjoyed the film much, much more if her role had not been to just be an overall PITA.

3884918,4,B002AK9URM,"I'd have given this 5 stars except that the supernatural elements of the movie were extremely weak.
The hints are subtle, which I don't mind, but they don't carry it through to a satisfying conclusion; and what was that stuff about the un-dead manatee crawling up the beach, a poor contrivance.

It is, however, a very realistic and insightful film about a failed marriage and all the unpleasantness  that comes with the territory.
Seems to me that this writer, as gifted as he may be, should avoid the supernatural/horror genre; it's just not his forte, but drama and the like he'd do extremely well with.
I think that was part of the problem with this film; there's such intense focus on the relationship issues that it completely overwhelms the horror aspects and you find yourself taking sides instead of caring about the haunted beach.
One almost gets the feeling that the writer/director may well have been going through a similar episode in his life or a divorce when this film was made.

This movies rates very low on the fright scale, although there are some fleeting moments of eeriness that are vaguely tangible but nothing sustainable.

As an aside note, Ive always thought that divorce lawyers must have one of the most entertaining jobs in the world.
I'm sure they've heard and seen it all; both parties going for blood, the name calling, insults and artery busting decibel breaking histrionics; and they have the best seats in the house. LOL!!!! I'm sure in some cases they need a referee and the big bell.

3884922,3,B002AK9URM,"[Rounded up from 2-1/2 stars, Moderate Spoilers] ""Peter"" (James Caviezel, ""The Passion of the Christ"") and ""Marcia"" (Claudia Karvan) think a getaway to a secluded beach with friends will be good for their marital discord (which includes spouting F-bombs at one another) and maybe rekindle their romantic flame.  But don't expect a heartwarming romance or picture-perfect ending.  First, they drive there in the rain.  Then, their friends never show.  They argue, then make up, then argue again, then make up again (this seems neverending).  The two of them are basically the entire cast, unless you count their dog ""Cricket"" and a few of the locals when they ask for directions.  And it takes about an hour, but the film finally gets going, after perhaps deliberately slow pacing, to give way to the onslaught in the last 1/2 hour, which is noticeably open-ended (the identity of the van's owner) and not for the squeamish, with an ending that you probably won't see coming.

3884930,5,B002AK9URM,"This actually is not the first time I watched this movie. I've seen it a long time ago offline, before watching it on Amazon. I personally do not care for streaming movies. I get a better movie experience going to a theater, watching a DVD, or watching a movie on regular cable because I never have to worry about quality or buffering or compatibility issues with things to download in order to watch it. It just is. And no internet required. Streaming has its issues from time to time regardless which site you use.

With Amazon I had to download some Silverlight software or something. Gets rather annoying the different factors that come into play when trying to stream something online. I never have that issue just using the traditional methods (e.g. movie theater, DVD, regular TV) of watching something before online streaming ever came into existence.

But this movie was heavily on my mind to watch again. And so I decided to rent it on Amazon since I had an Amazon gift card (might as well use it on something); and that's what I did this time. I like movies with a bit of a twist in them (like Session 9, Eden Lake, etc.) and this had it. Caviezel's character played a bit of a controlling role in his marriage in this film; not leaving the area when his wife wanted to. Had he not been controlling, the outcome would not have been what it was. The first time I watched the movie long ago, I didn't grow on Karvan (the wife in the movie). And watching her acting the second time, I still am not quite into her playing this part. It was awkward, but didn't stop me from watching the movie. Her character took ""charge"" a bit late in my opinion; that contributed to the outcome. I think if she had put her foot down early on in their trip when he asked her if she wanted to drive that the end results would have been better. But she let him control that situation for whatever reason. Disappointing, but interesting nonetheless.

They first run over a kangaroo and the bus with the fighting couple runs over the same kangaroo .  Mistake one.  Mistake two-she kills a hawk by throwing the egg against the tree .  Three he kills the sea cow.  This movie reminds me of Hitchcock's The Byrds. It seems anyone who entered this stretch of beach doesn't come out alive.

3884948,1,B002AK9URM,"In this movie, the dog was the most sane and also the most likeable. A couple in trouble with their marriage go on a long weekend. The wife (Carla) wants to go to a hotel and the husband  (Peter) wants to go camping; they go camping. They are supposed to meet up with friends, but the friends never show up and we never find out why. The husband is immature and selfish and the wife is selfish and finds fault with everything; they make a great pair. On top of that, neither of them has any respect for nature at all so it's not easy to find anything to like about either one. Cricket, Peter's dog, is very easy to like. Then there's a dying sea cow, which is a scary animal on land and seems to be the reason the couple go crazy. There's also a gruesome scene of a family Peter discovers, but it wasn't clear how it tied into the rest of the movie unless it was about more death. The movie didn't flow well at all. Carla eventually gets fed up with Peter saying it's time to leave without actually leaving and then Cricket is missing, but Carla takes off anyway--this makes me dislike the Carla character even more. Eventually Peter finds Carla dead, but it's not clear why she's dead (I saw this on TV, so maybe they edited out a critical part), then he goes nuts, goes crashing through the woods, and finds a road but gets splattered by a big truck. I suppose we're meant to be horrified by how Peter's and Carla's lives ended, but all I could think at the end of the movie was, ""Where is Cricket? Did Peter leave her in the car? Can she get out? If not, will  someone find her? I want to see a happy ending for Cricket."" But, sadly, we never find out what happened to Cricket. Very strange movie. I gave a star for Cricket.",1339891200,12,1727,4.198795180722891

I just finished watching this. And like previous reviews suggest, it does stay with you. I live in the city, so I'm not much for camping. But in case I ever do so, I will make sure not to make mother nature angry lest I end up like these poor bastards. This movie is creepy. It has a solid script. It doesn't waste time trying to be scary. It allows the actors, who do a good job, to go about their business and the director just captures it all. The beach setting is beautiful, and it easily could be used for a romantic story. And that is what makes it creepy. I won't spoil anything, except to say that it is not a good idea watching this on a stormy night. Unless you enjoy real sound effects to give it that extra dimension. I give it 4 stars only because it is not a movie I would watch regularly which is what a 5 star movie is to me, but I highly recommend it.",1339718400,13,956,4.031578947368421

3884951,2,B002AK9URM,"I bought this movie because I am interested in watching anything with Jim Caviezel.  Although his acting was superb as always, I was extremely disappointed in his role in this movie.  I'm not sure this movie is up to being even a ""B"" movie - and he is a more talented actor than that.  That said, I was not prepared for the attacking birds, creepy spiders, and (OMG what I hate to see the most!) SNAKES!  Much of the movie is extremely dark, and I found myself saying why didn't they wait until daylight so they could see where they were going?  So EVEN I COULD SEE where they were going?  I did not anticipate all of the obscenities that were in the movie, and I know he is just acting, but, like another viewer noted, I did not expect this language from soft spoken Jim of 'Person of Interest' fame.  For the record, the fine print on the dust cover reads ""R"" for ""language, some disturbing violent images, and brief sexual material.""  I guess it was the ""disturbing violent images"" and the snakes that really did me in.  When Peter (Jim) peaks in a tent, I covered my eyes and asked my husband to tell me what was there.  (Although I already knew....just didn't want to see.)  I suppose that some people will be entertained by ""Nature's Grave"" - I just was not one of them.  Unlike many movies I watch, I do not want to see this one again.  Please!",1328918400,5,1351,4.313492063492063
3884952,4,B002AK9URM,"*** Contains Spoilers ***I really had to watch this a second time to ""get"" it. The story reminded me of the classic ""Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner,"" a morality tale about the consequences of not respecting life. In the old story, sailors wantonly kill a sea bird and bring down the wrath of nature upon the rest of their voyage. In this version, this morally corrupt couple wrecks their marriage through adultery and an abortion. This crime against nature is the heart of the plot although not revealed until nearly the end. They go off on a beach holiday to restore their relationship but it only brings out more of their selfish natures and they continue to desecrate the living things around them, bringing down Nature's wrath until both get what they deserve in the end.
I was surprised at the coarse language on the part of the players, esp. Mr. Caviezel. Yes, it's true to the character but shocking nonetheless considering his religious assertions. He refuses to do sex scenes but apparently doesn't draw the line at profanity. I guess it's what actors do.
Having said that, he's a terrific leading man and the ""wife"" seems nuts for spurning his advances on a romantic beach!",1328659200,15,1181,4.737864077669903
3884953,5,B002AK9URM,"Jim Caviezel plays a very different role in this movie than most of his action movies. The music is very eerie and keeps you in suspense. They seem like alot of modern couples having marital troubles and looking for a vacation to reconnect
again. As the movie evolves, you realize there are strange events happening to warrant danger, but unexplainable. The ending was shocking to me and not expected. I also wondered what happened to the dog. Good thriller.",1328140800,2,458,4.810126582278481
3884954,2,B002AK9URM,"I wouldn't have even gotten through this movie. It's not that I am some big Caviezel fan but this film was just so weird. It wasn't exactly bad but it's not stunning mystery and certainly no horror like it's been described. It's a subtle-type mystery but unfortunately the suspense is too subtle.

I felt the movie was best when it focused on the couple's troubled marriage. I found that more compelling than the so-called scary element. It was as if the scary thing was just thrown in. The movie was on about an hour before anything weird started happening so you didn't really need that element at all. I think the film would've been good as just a film about a couple getting away to work out their problems.

The acting was very good and is what kept me watching, especially Jim Caviezel. His excitement for the beach makes you want to stay there with him just to see what adventures he finds each day. But as you watch you begin to feel like the wife where you just wanna leave because nothing's happening. In the film she says, ""I'm bored!"" It's then that I began to feel the exact same way about the film. It just seemed to move so quick in the beginning and stalled when they got to the beach. After so many scenes of watching Peter surf and curse out his wife, you get bored with it.

There wasn't enough action or any action for this to be a suspense. Stuff should have started happening way in the beginning of the movie. It's like the writers tried to be too clever and play tricks with your mind but it fell short. It only ended up being repetitive and the few scary things that did happen weren't scary at all.

Jim saves the day for this film. If he hadn't played his character with such excitement I would've turned it off. Peter (Caviezel) slowly begins to be sucked in by the beach and just as I became fascinated about that fact, thinking he would show some mental instability because of that obsession, it all went nowhere. It would've been great to see Peter so crazed that he lost sense of everything and then you could understand the beach's hold on him. He almost got to that point and just when he got crazy with his wife and wouldn't let her leave, the film went in a total different direction and that was frustrating.

And the ending was pathetic.",1326499200,17,2275,4.394299287410926

The setting is extremely effective--the beach looks so civilized and domestic:  there are roads and paths, and at first there is less of a sense of wilderness than one might expect.  As the oddness and the sense of wrongness slowly build, the contrast is striking.  The choice of the dugong as a motif was inspired--it looked completely inert and completely threatening at the same time.

There were a couple of mistakes in this movie but not enough to hurt a great time on a Wednesday afternoon with nothing to do. The tension between the young couple connected well with the unfamiliar Australian coastline wild. This is a scary movie for a lot of reasons you don't normally see in a woodsy thriller. The ending was scary as heck and makes you think about camping in the wilderness without full knowledge of not only where you are but what's watching you and what can harm you.

  Nothing the blurbs promise does this movie ever deliver.

  The producers of this film had every opportunity of making the best of some gorgeous beach landscapes... unfortunately all was lost in complete darkness and we aren't even given a hint as to why.

  There is absolutely no plot or story line to this movie.  There is no connection between the two main characters.  Jim Caveiziel must be really harf up for money.... or certainly needs a new agent.

  There is absolutely nothing scary or horrific about this movie, except the fact that someone actually bothered to produce it.  Sigh.

  The only gratifying scene was the last 5 minutes when Cavieziel was smashed into smithereens by an Aussie 18-wheeler.  Thank you, God.

3884965,1,B002AK9URM,"All I did while watching this dreck was wonder why someone with the talent of Jim Caviezel would think that this film adds to his life experience.  I mean, he's played Jesus, and I just watched the ""Thin Red Line"" where he...plays Jesus, sort of, and now I just can't imagine how this was pitched to him as a good idea.

Other reviews have covered the plot elements adequately, but I must shine a light on the overall vileness of the two main characters.  Constant, vicious, arguing.  I realize this was part of the story, but there you have it - I don't enjoy nasty arguing between couples for two hours straight.  Within 15 minutes I was pointing out to the Significant Other (who spent the whole movie being productive on the computer and leaving me to agonize alone) that I simply couldn't wait for one of them to be killed, just so I wouldn't have to listen to them any more.

""Look,"" I say, ""Jim Caviezel is playing a jerk for the first time!""
""Look,"" I say, ""That beach is really pretty.""
""Look,"" I say, ""They called that thing a Sea Cow.  It's a manatee, isn't it?""
""No,"" says the S.O., ""That's one of those other things.  It's got a weird name, but it's not quite a manatee....""

And then they reveal it as a dugong (which I mistakenly thought was spelled, ""dewgong,"" but that's a Pokemon, and this is a manatee-relative.  A dugong?  And then there's a snake, and a bush-baby-type thing, but a dugong?  Who names these creatures?  At least the dugong made another appearance (and a startling one at that) later in the movie, so they got their money's worth out of that big plastic model.

But, the answer to my whining query?  I see it now, as the bare-chested Caviezel wanders up and down the coastline, looking tanned and fit.  They sold him on the movie by showing him pictures of the beach.  He got to spend every day out there, surfing and whatnot on a beautiful, isolated stretch of sand and turquoise water, and I really can't blame him for that.",1255132800,14,1962,4.450980392156863

This movie did not need an evaluation. It really is just a waste of time and I had to skip over bits and pieces, because it is so predictable and annoying in every way possible - but, I liked the actor and actress. I feel bad that they needed this role to earn money.

As someone who loves psychology and think-tanking, this movie was a complete nightmare!!!! Here is a list of what the husband was: mentally ill, angry, unforgiving, not forgetting of past mistakes, selfish, arrogant, does not know how to camp AT ALL, alcoholic, uncaring to his wife's concerns, slave driver, probably did gaslight his wife when they were married and living together, cares nothing about safety or the environment, was unrealistic about his conduct the whole movie, never heard his wife out, and made every wrong and incorrect decision humanly possible. In reality, he would have been suicidal and would have never gave his wife a second thought unless it was to kill her. This was an attempt at a horror flick, but still a better story line than most horror movies anyway. The wife was not a survivalist. She should have put up with his attitude at the end... Anyways, she was giving him a second chance at husbandry, for God knows what reason.

Just click my rating as helpful and let this movie slip into history.",1498608000,,1475,4.604562737642586
