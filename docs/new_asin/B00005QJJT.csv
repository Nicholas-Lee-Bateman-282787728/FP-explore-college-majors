1648601,5,B00005QJJT,"What a story!  This is better than The Outlaw, and resembles it in pacing, acting, and plausibility. Eat your heart out, Mr Hughes. The dialogue is brilliant, all of a sudden; and the motivation totally credible. ""What do you do? I'm a bank robber. Oh yes. What else? This and that. I own a citrus grove; I'll give you a job. Gee, thanks."" This film features the politest gangsters I've ever been privileged to watch. ""Take a seat, Earl. Thank you. Care for a cigar? No thank you. You've just saved my life, Jack. Thank you very much."" The heists touch imaginative heights unequalled. Eat your heart out, Rififi. The only thing is that Adolf and Jack are a little untidy. After you take your golf bags out of the car boot, fixed them to their trolleys, packed them full of shooting irons, you really should close the boot, or trunk, before trundling off to the green. And missing the putt at half an inch --- 5 times! --- that takes superior golfing skill. I wonder if the Coens ever saw this masterpiece? I also wonder how it could have been made in 1960. Wonders will never cease.",1160006400,13,1082,4.4646464646464645
1648602,5,B00005QJJT,This is a great 50's movie starring and directed by Walter Matthau as a bank robber falling in love with a librarian who tries to set him straight!!,1110240000,3,148,4.321428571428571
1648603,1,B00005QJJT,"Looks like a rough-cut pilot for a 'fifties TV series.  Clumsy dialogue, clumsy editing.

I enjoyed it though.  Clever plot, good performance by Matthau.",1425081600,,153,5.291666666666667
1648604,2,B00005QJJT,The only movie directed by Walter Matthau...thank God. I love Matthau as an actor and his comedic timing is legendary....but I'm glad he stuck to acting!,1422576000,,153,4.923076923076923
1648605,5,B00005QJJT,"Features a very very young Matthau.  If you are a fan, you will like this movie.  The production value is quite low, but still enjoyed a view into the past.",1407542400,,156,4.166666666666667
1648606,3,B00005QJJT,"While the story is pretty basic and predictable - it is still an enjoyable film.  This will ring especially true to fans of the genre.  I thought it would be fun to see Walter Matthau in a ""B"" movie and at such a young age.  It's a good movie, if your in the mood for a good ""Gangster Story"".",1399680000,,292,3.9152542372881354
1648607,2,B00005QJJT,Now we know why Walter Matthau never directed another movie. With the cast it could have been a good crime story with a competent director. It is one of the most over acted movies I ever saw. No one just does anything. They feel the need to say what they are going to do before they do it.,1396224000,,289,4.0
1648608,1,B00005QJJT,"If you get a kick out of bad movies - this one is for you.  It is among the worst five movies ever.  Bad story, bad actors, and bad acting.  Don't waste your time.",1387584000,,163,3.735294117647059
1648609,3,B00005QJJT,"I watched this because it's one of only a few movies that Carol Grace (aka Mrs. Walter Matthau, aka Carol Marcus, the former wife of William Saroyan, bosom pal to Gloria Vanderbilt and Truman Capote, model for Holly Golightly, and rags-to-riches stepdaughter of the head of Bendix Corp.) ever appeared in.  Carol had a decent acting career on Broadway, and Matthau of course became a megastar and a household name, but you would have never guessed it based on their acting in this movie.  It's like Matthau was trying to channel Humphrey Bogart for a guest comedy role on ""Get Smart"" or ""Saturday Night Live"".

The scenes between Matthau and his missus when they first meet in a public library and when she announces she's leaving him are so bad, they're funny.  As is another scene where Matthau misses an easy golf putt about five times.  And don't miss the policeman near the end who actually mouths the word ""Bang!"" as he shoots someone through a window.  I rewound and watched that three times because I just couldn't believe it.  The cops and gangsters embody every B-movie cliche of cops and gangsters ever invented, short of having the cops eat donuts on the job.  Apparently the production also hired some real local policemen on the cheap to play police in the film, and the whole movie was obviously made on a shoestring budget, with production values about on the level of a vintage ""Dragnet"" TV episode.  Too bad Joe Friday couldn't pop up somewhere, he'd have fit right in.

Best part of the picture is seeing all the shots of retro 1959 interiors (watch for the exact same patterned curtains to pop up in two separate locations in two different scenes) and gorgeous classic vintage cars, full of fins and curves that look great even in black and white - at one point an entire parking lot full of those beauties.  I also particularly liked the plant-filled interior lobby of the library, which looked about 20 years ahead of its time.  Other than that, this picture is like Matthau, wife and friends decided to make a cheap movie for fun on their days off from real work.  Matthau himself reportedly said this was his worst movie ever. Fortunately it only lasts about 68 minutes, and is funny in an MST3K sort of way.

If you need some extra laughs, be sure to check IMDB online for this movie, where you can find a movie poster that appears to have been made up much, much later and features Matthau with 70s long hair 'stache, sideburns and three-piece suit (none of which were in style in 1959) in NYC (the film is set in Southern California) against the WTC Twin Towers (not even built in 1959).",1374883200,,2614,4.605603448275862
1648610,1,B00005QJJT,"This movie was so badly acted I could not get beyond the first 15 minutes.
I would not recommend this to anyone.",1360540800,4,112,4.136363636363637
1648611,3,B00005QJJT,"Walter Matthau (1920-2000) appeared in over a hundred films, but his only directorial credit was for the film Gangster Story (1959).  Matthau also appears in the crime drama as Jack Martin, a career criminal who escapes from custody, and after single handedly pulling of a daring bank robbery, comes to the attention of crime boss Earl Dawson (Bruce MacFarlane), who offers him a position in his organization.  Martin accepts and due to the gang's successful criminal exploits, eventually enters the FBI's 10 most wanted list.

Gangster films were hot during this time, however crime typically does not pay, so things do not end well, in this rather routine affair.  A highlight is a rather daring theft at a golf course, and subsequent shootout with the police.  Carol Grace, who was married to Matthau from 1959 until his death in 2000, makes her film debut, as a librarian who falls in love with Martin.

1648612,1,B00005QJJT,"It's been amusing in the past viewing ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", proclaimed by many to be the worst movie ever made. At least that movie was so bad that it was funny/appealing. However this, ""Gangster Story"", is just simply the worst movie I can recall seeing. This is so bad in every catagory (writing, acting, directing, filming and editing) that it is just terrible. Honestly it deserves 0 stars. No fun watching this cheapy. Virtually nothing is plausable, connected or makes sense. Save your money and even more importantly, your time, and don't waste a second on this bomb...it's the pits! Worse than ""Lepke"".
""Gangster Story"" really puts in doubt the depth of Walter Matthau's actual talent. (He starred and directed)",1311033600,,724,4.942622950819672
7950667,3,B00005QJJT,"Not bad for its time. Good acting, simple sets, no overpowering sound track. Interesting plot. It would be called an ""indie"" film today. If you enjoy Walter Matthau, and who doesn't, you'll enjoy this fresh look at his talent.",1465776000,,226,4.82051282051282

7950669,5,B00005QJJT,"Walter Matthau directed and stars with his real life wife Carol Matthau (Carol Grace).Filmed in the late fifties with a limited budget, by today's standards it would be called an 'independent' film. Gangster Story won't make you forget Angels with Dirty Faces however if your a Walter Matthau fan you'll enjoy seeing him act with his wife and there is a bit of suspense here. Starring as a crafty criminal trying to go straight Matthau turns in his usual excellent performance in this low budget feature.",1463616000,,504,4.872093023255814

7950672,3,B00005QJJT,"Nice try by Matthau, but it's no wonder it was his only directing job. Very B rate. If it weren't for the chuckles from the silliness of the writing & acting, it would have been hard to watch!",1448236800,,192,4.078947368421052
