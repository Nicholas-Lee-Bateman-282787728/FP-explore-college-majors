8121324,5,B000FDK782,"It is fascinating and certainly makes one think. We'll still buy beads as there is not that much that will affect the conditions in China. Mardi Gras isn't the only event/occasion that they're used for, but we'll not buy so many.",1493596800,,229,4.609756097560975
8121325,4,B000FDK782,"Good documentary. However, I don't really see how this is much different than American CEO's who make hundreds of millions of dollars while many workers are making $7 an hour. Walmart is making millions off of these Chinese workers and they still only pay their workers minimum wage. If they paid their source (Chinese factory) more for the beads then maybe the factories would pay their workers better. Much of this problem comes from American CEO's greed. They have their corporations in the Cayman Islands so they don't have to pay taxes AND they find ways to avoid giving their workers health care by giving them 39 hour work weeks. I have a cousin who is a professor at a university who can barely afford a basement apartment because he has to pay off student loans and he is in his 50's! My son-in-law makes $75,000 a year and can barely afford health insurance and prescriptions for himself, my daughter and their 3 kids. I paid into Medicare and social security since I started working at 16. Now I'm 65 and I make $560 a month in Social security and (something I had never known) MY MEDICARE PAYMENTS COME OUT OF MY SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK WHICH I AM TAXED ON!! But the godzillionaire corporations aren't paying any taxes! I worked all my life and I'm not looking for handouts. My only sin was being born poor. I'm not saying any of this is right. I'm saying it's all unfair. There are more equitable ways to distribute the wealth but it will never happen as long as the corporations and the rich have their say in it.",1489017600,4,1525,4.528985507246377

The DVD was in perfect condition and shipped fast! Thanks!!",1461369600,,162,5.269230769230769
8121327,5,B000FDK782,"Excellent documentary. With wit and irony, it exposes the harsh labor conditions behind many of our products without the melodrama that characterizes so many documentaries of this type. I show this film to my college students to get them thinking and talking about the debates surrounding globalization. The film is really effective for this because it highlights arguments made by different sides of the argument. It has virtual no narration, but rather lets the workers and the conditions speak for themselves.",1437091200,2,512,5.333333333333333
8121328,5,B000FDK782,"H. Rollins (Black Flag/ H. Rollins Band) mentioned this film on an episode of his H. Rollins Show (TV) - I immediately contacted the director for a private copy as I was no where near any of their planned screening locations- Loved this Documentary. As an American-Born Chinese woman, it was amazing to hear the interviews and to follow the stories of actual factory workers in China as they produce these plastic trinkets. Carnivalesque Films has piqued my interest again and again.",1365033600,,483,4.902439024390244
8121329,4,B000FDK782,"A documentary about the labor used to produce Mardi Gras beads. Young uneducated, rural young women are used because they are easier to control and will work long hours for 20 cents an hour.

8121331,5,B000FDK782,Great documentary. It traces a simple commodity and reveals its social and economic relationships that are hidden view. The 'cultural' exchange experiment in the movie is particularly revealing. There is a shortened version of the film also included in the DVD which is recommended for classroom viewing. Recommended for students in sociology and anthropology.,1317254400,2,360,5.685185185185185
8121332,4,B000FDK782,"This Ironweed Edition from February 2008 presents three films on the topic of economic globalization. Is it a good thing, a bad thing or really a mixture of both?

The principal film is David Redmon's Mardi Gras: Made in China in which he explores the issue in terms of a juxtaposition of the stories of revelers at a pre-Katrina New Orleans Mardi Gras, who exchange beads for nudity, with the stories of the workers and factory owner from Fuzhou, China where the beads are made.

Redmon tells his story in a no narrative,non preachy way that makes its points without beating its viewers over the head. Redmon links the stories of the New Orleans tourists and locals with the images and stories of the factory workers from China where the beads are created. Some of the most telling moments are the interviews with factory owner Roger who feels he has created the model work environment. He shows what he believes to be happy workers playing basketball and relaxing inside a factory that is more likely to hand out punishments for failed work assignments than rewards. It is also surprising that many of the revelers in New Orleans, both local and tourist, do not know where the beads actually come from.

The second film No Logo: Brands, Globalization & Resistance  is more of a film essay featuring Canadian Naomi Klein who explains that we have become a society of brands with each company attempting to sell a lifestyle or ideal rather than actual products. This concept allows the companies to manufacture their goods in foriegn countries no matter what the costs. The film ends with the developments of resistance movements aimed at these companies to make them work better and more responsibly. This film was the weakest of the three but it still forces its viewers to think.

The third short Matamoros:The Human Face of Globalization attempts to show the environmental and human costs of globalization as a  result of NAFTA. The film produced by the Sierra Club and narrated by Edward James Olmos is a powerful 11 minute feature that really brings home the problems of the global economic community.

Kudos once again to Ironweed from producing a timely and educational edition which is well worth seeking out.",1277942400,2,2218,4.851851851851852
8121333,5,B000FDK782,"This film was a revelation!  We may be aware that many of our goods come from overseas, but this film lets us LIVE that reality, following Mardi Gras beads from the hands of diligent Chinese factory workers to frenzied Mardi Gras celebrants in New Orleans.  The director never ""tells"" when he can ""show"" instead, and as a result we are drawn into the story in a personal, intimate, and eye-opening way.  The contrasts are startling and the realities complex.  One of the best and most thought-provoking documentaries I've seen.",1221955200,9,527,4.887640449438202
