2365693,1,B000A6CLL0,"Many will no doubt disagree with this assessment, but I hope you at least read why.

Following the success of four live-action TV series and ten feature-length films, producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga attempted to create a fifth live-action ""Star Trek"" series that would be set approximately 100 years prior to the time of Captain Kirk (during the original ""Star Trek"" series of 1966-1969), 200 years before the time of Captain Picard (during the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" of 1987-1994) and 100 years after the fictional character Dr. Zefram Cochrane flew the first warp-capable spaceship, as depicted in the 1996 film ""Star Trek: First Contact"".

The new series, entitled ""Enterprise"", debuted in the fall of 2001, months after the previous ""Star Trek"" series, ""Voyager"", concluded its seven-year run.  As the show's title implies, the ship used in the show was named ""Enterprise"" and had serial number NX-01 with a maximum speed of warp 5.  It's crew was comprised of Captain Jonathan Archer (played by Scott Bakula, formerly the lead actor of the sci-fi TV show ""Quantum Leap"" of 1989-1993), Vulcan science officer T'Pol (Jolene Blalok), pilot Ensign Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery), ship's communications officer Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), the Denobulan Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley), weapon's officer Lieutenant Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) and ship's engineer Commander Charles 'Trip' Tucker III (Connor Trinneer).

With over 12,000,000 viewers watching the first season's premiere episode, it looked like UPN would have another successful ""Star Trek"" series, just as it had with ""Voyager"".  Unfortunately, subsequent shows had ever-shrinking audiences.  The average number of viewers per episode for the first season was about 6.7 million; for the second season, this number dropped to 4.4 million and for the third season, the number dropped further to 3.8 million.  UPN nearly cancelled the show after the third season, but decided instead to give it one more chance with a fourth season.  Unfortunately, with only an average of about 3.1 million viewers per fourth-season episode, UPN did finally cancel the series in 2005 even though there were still another three seasons yet to be produced.

Why, then, did ""Enterprise"" fail to capture the attention of the estimated 30,000,000 ""Star Trek"" fans living in the U.S.A.?  I include several possible overall reasons:  mostly uninteresting characters (except for Dr. Phlox and T'Pol), lack of connection with the other ""Star Trek"" TV series (except the fourth season), the introduction of species (the Suliban and Xindi) that had never previously been known in ""Star Trek"" and all-too-often mediocre writing (except the fourth season).  The third season, though popular with some people, I found to be the most problematic of all:

1. The entire third season was a single story arc about Captain Archer trying to find out who the Xindi are, then, once finding them, figuring out how to stop them from using an even more powerful weapon to completely destroy Earth after they used a smaller weapon at the end of the second season to kill 3,000,000 Earth residents.  This should have been done in no more than 4 episodes, not 24.

2. If you have watched George Lucas' original 1977 ""Star Wars"" film, you'll quickly realize that the Xindi's ultimate planet-killing weapon was nothing new: it was simply a copy (somewhat smaller) of George Lucas' spherical ""Death Star"" from 27 years earlier.

3. During the third season, it is revealed that the Xindi are carrying out the wishes of an advanced species from 500 years in the future to build the ""Death Star"" copy to destroy Earth in the past rather than being at war with Earth in their present. This sounds awfully familiar with the plot of ""Star Trek: First Contact"", in which the Borg travel to Earth's past so that it will be assimilated in the present.  Who were two of the principle writers of ""First Contact""?  Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who was also one of the producers of the film.  In other words, the Xindi story arc that occupied the entire third season was a rehashing of the plot from ""First Contact"" (which was less than 2 hours), as well as a poor copy of part of George Lucas' work from ""Star Wars"".

Given that the five live-action ""Star Trek"" TV series represent 28 years of TV broadcasts, I regard the third season of ""Enterprise"" to be the least entertaining of them all since it was completely wasted on the Xindi story arc.  The wonderful work of reconnecting ""Enterprise"" to the previous ""Star Trek shows"" that Manny Coto managed to do during the fourth season of ""Enterprise"" could have been done during the third season had the Xindi story arc not been done at all or limited to 4 episodes.  What I and many other ""Star Trek"" fans had expected would occur during ""Enterprise"" was the Earth-Romulan War as eluded to in the original ""Star Trek"" TV series, as well as the formation of the United Federation of Planets (UFP); not a war with a never previously known species.  Unfortunately, the premature cancellation of the show, which I blame in large part to the poorly conceived Xindi story arc, prevented the Earth-Romulan War from being portrayed, and the actual events that lead to the formation of the UFP could only touched on in the fourth season.

Consequently, I rate the third season of ""Enterprise"" with 1 out of 5 stars.  Of the 24 third-season episodes, the only one that is particularly memorable is ""Doctor's Orders"", in which Dr. Phlox remains the only crew member awake during a crossing of a treacherous region of space. (This, too, was a rehash of ""Voyager"" episode ""One"".) Sadly, it wouldn't be until the fourth season of ""Enterprise"" that the show truly blossomed under the guidance of Manny Coto, but it came too little too late to save it from cancellation.",1121299200,26,5839,4.981481481481482
2365694,5,B000A6CLL0,"After two season of eroding ratings,the wrath of fans, and the ST franchise at an all time low, The Third season of the newly re-christened Star Trek Enterprise had taken the series into a new direction and produced some of the best episodes since the end of Deep Space Nine.
 Taking it's cue from the second season finale The Expanse,the entire season deals with Captain Jonathan Archer's mission to stop the Xindi from destroying Earth with a superweapon after a devastating attack. Albiet,there were some weak semi stand alone episodes (Extinction,North Star,Carpenter St.,and E2),among classic episodes which ranks with some of the franchises best(Impulse,Twilight,Azati Prime/Damage,The Counsel/Countdown/Zero Time).Staff member Manny Coto was responsible for new direction which made for the most exciting season of the entire four year run.
 Unfortunatly the exciting new direction couldn't produce ratings and was barely renewed after a fan based letter writing campaign,echoing the classic series fan fueled renewal. As a result,Coto became the official show runner which he produced one last season to correct the many continuety errors that has littered the series from the beginning.",1120867200,50,1195,5.596685082872928
2365715,5,B000A6CLL0,"Great series  . . . . sad it only lasted the few years it did.  Story arches began getting better.  Some episodes had that ""ST:TOS"" feel to them.  We can only hope the new series will do right by it.",1498348800,,199,3.9
2365716,4,B000A6CLL0,"Overall I personally believe the writing and acting are still good.  There were two episodes that were ""where the heck did that come from...were the writers that lost and bored"" but the other episodes were well worth watching.  Some of the episodes were outstanding and required some deep conceptual thinking due to challenges associated with time being a malleable dimension and social challenges that are relevant in the 2000 AD era but shown in a futuristic setting.  It is interesting meeting new ""aliens"" and seeing some ""old"" aliens return.  The Archer character really matures as a ""leader"" in this series.  The T'pol character continues to serve as a temptress and has her own vulcan issues.  ""Trip"" and the doctor are better refined and both become more and more ""likable.""  ""Oshie"" gets more opportunities to ""shine"" on the Enterprise and in two episodes in particular.  The ""military"" characters add a LOT of realism for such a ship (i.e. like Marines) on such a mission but they could have been  much more developed instead of a bunch of hand to hand combat training which will likely have no effect on alien species and instead carried MUCH more refined weapons and protection not available to the ship's crew.  I am NOT a big Trekkie in any manner but this is good science fiction and overall well worth the entertainment time and continues to be my favorite of all of the Start Trek series.",1494115200,,1405,4.816666666666666
2365717,4,B000A6CLL0,"Earth has been attacked by an alien superweapon. Florida and the Caribbean have been left in flames and over seven million people are dead. The alien attackers are traced to a mysterious region of space known as the Delphic Expanse and an alien race known as the Xindi, so Starfleet sends the NX-01 Enterprise to the region to investigate further and stop the Xindi before they can launch a second attack.

According to conventional wisdom, Star Trek: Enterprise gets a lot better with its third season. The show's best writer, Manny Coto, was promoted to producer and given more creative freedom. The entire season also has a strong, ongoing story arc. It's still not full-on serialisation - many episodes are still stand-alone, just with more frequent mentions of the ongoing storyline - but it's closer than Trek has gotten before across a whole year. There's also more attention paid to character growth, such as T'Pol developing an addiction to a chemical and then going through withdrawal, leaving her permanently emotionally damaged, whilst the human crewmembers initially hunger for revenge against the Xindi before learning more about them and how they've been manipulated by another alien race.

It is certainly true that Enterprise's third season is more interesting than the first two. There is more of a sense of tension and drama and the show feels more experimental. Long-term Trek producers Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, criticised by many fans for presiding over the long-term decline of the franchise, seem to have backed off and given Coto more freedom to innovate. The producers cleverly realised that their storyline, although it had legs, was still insufficient to fill 25 episodes, so were still able to bring in side-stories to expand the texture of the new setting of the Expanse. Although some of these episodes are undeniably filler (Extinction and Rajin are groan-inducingly boring), there seems to be a far higher hit rate than in previous seasons.

The season also gives us Enterprise's first truly classic episode. Twilight riffs on previous episode ideas but also takes a strong influence from the movie Memento, with Archer affected by a neurological problem which prevents him from forming long-term memories. The episode unfolds as an alternate view of what happens if the Enterprise's mission fails and, although we know it won't, the episode is well-written and directed enough that it doesn't matter too much.

Other strong episodes include Proving Ground (even if the arrival of Andorian occasional semi-ally Shran is a little implausible), Strategem and Doctor's Orders (an excellent showcase for John Billingsley's acting). The season also ends with a strong arc starting with Azati Prime, where Enterprise takes incredibly heavy damage and is left crippled for the rest of the season. The crew have to find a way of destroying the Xindi weapon without having their normal resources to call upon, so have to resort to a diplomatic solution. In a post-9/11 world and with the far darker Battlestar Galactica reboot hitting screens at the same time, Enterprise takes a very different approach is still very true to the ethos of Star Trek, and does so reasonably well. The season-ending cliffhanger is less than compelling, however.

The third season of Star Trek: Enterprise (****) is indeed better than the first two and the finest season of Star Trek since the end of Deep Space Nine. It's not perfect and occasionally resorts to tiresome Star Trek standbys, but it entertains and successfully finds a solution to the season-long arc that channels Star Trek at its finest.",1489881600,,3614,5.11864406779661

When they change the theme in the 2nd season ,  CHEEZ  after an exciting prelude, that ""reworked""  theme comes on and spoils the tension and mood.  It is STRAIGHT OUTTA  a 1979 TV series , not about space but more on the lines of something like ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""  WTH were they thinking when they chose the theme and then blanded it up in the 2nd season ...  Does Scott B have a bland field that emanates from him?

Some episodes are better than others but that is to be expected.  FYI  -  I rarely watch live telivision because of the commercials.

Season 3 is delightful, with the exception of the opening credits theme song, which has been re-recorded for season 3 as elevator music.

2365916,3,B000A6CLL0,I'm not sure if Scott Bakula is writing all these 5-star reviews but this show just doesn't measure up after a couple of seasons. Its not a bad show in any way but it doesn't blow your hair back either. No real emotional connections with the characters and no really amazing standout episodes either. Its just all okay.,1481846400,,319,4.517241379310345

2365923,5,B000A6CLL0,"Season 3 is IMO perhaps the best single season storyline of all the Trek series. Admittedly, and intentionally, there are not too many seasons like this due to the favoritism given to one-off episodes.

This season compares well with my favorite seasons of DS9, Voyager and TNG. Had Enterprise been like this for its 3 other seasons and if they were able to tie it all together coherently w more gravitas, Enterprise might have approached the high quality storytelling of the best sci-fi series of all time, Babylon 5. Considering that Enterprise was not handicapped by the hokie graphics of B5, they possibly could've surpassed it.

Unfortunately the rest of Enterprise is much too uneven to be equal to the 2nd and 3rd best overall series, DS9 and TNG. You can have Voyager. The jarring start of season 4 when the crew go back in time to fight the Nazis in WW2 is what I mean by uneven. But that's all pointless speculation of what could've been. Don't let that get in the way of enjoying season 3 of Enterprise.",1481155200,,1014,4.627777777777778

2365961,5,B000A6CLL0,"As with the original Star Trek, STE grows and grows on one.  The acting in season 3 and the plot lines are very, very dark and serious.  It's all very exciting and suspenseful.  But, on a lighter note, the ladies are allowed to explore something that only STE and DS9 do, which is sexuality and sex.  (Now, it's not as funny and earthy as the great Farscape, but, it's pretty intense. But, there are no instances of Hynerian sex!)

I heartily recommend STE to all, and can only ask, ""Where have your gone, Jolene Blalock? A nation turn's its lonely eyes to you.  And, Linda Park too!)",1478217600,,584,4.411214953271028

2366223,5,B000A6CLL0,"If I had reviewed the 3rd Season of Enterprise right after these episodes initially aired, I would have given the season 3 Stars.  At that time, I had become disillusioned with the writing for Star Trek: Voyager and Enterprise.  I believe the writing had reached its peak in the last few seasons of Deep Space 9.  Voyager had a good crew, but the Star Trek: Lost In Space series arc left me unimpressed.  I liked the idea of going back to the beginning of Star Fleet for the Enterprise series arc, but I thought the 1st and 2nd seasons were uneven, with good episodes and not so good episodes.  The 3rd season introduced new species at a time when I wanted to see episodes fill in gaps left by the Original series and first movies.  Some season had some very good episodes, and even the token Western Episode, as well as the ""return"" to Earth in 2004, but after that episode, I lost interest again, and actually only watched the last two episodes of the 3rd Season, waiting for the 4th Season premiere, which led me to believe the writers had gotten in way over their heads with the Temporal Cold War.  I remember thinking ""Thank God!"" When the character promised the timeline would be restored to normal for good after the first few 4th Season episodes.

This time around, I had just finished going through all the Next Generation and DS9 episodes.  I skipped Voyager and went first to Enterprise.  The first 2 seasons were a little better than I remembered.  However, the big surprise was that I thought the 3rd Season was quite good this time around.  I didn't mind the Xindi arc at all.  I still believe the 4th Season is the best, except for killing off Tripp in the final episode, but I now believe the 3rd Season is almost as good as the 4th Season.  Now, I really wish Enterprise would have been renewed for one more season.  I would have loved to see an all out war between the Star Fleet and the Romulans, with no face to face meeting between Romulans and Humans.  However, I'll just have to watch those episodes with my mind's eye.",1470700800,,2042,4.448924731182796

Buried within are several silly stories, such as Hoshi meets a psychic vampire, there's an obligatory western stand alone episode, a modern day episode, some possible future episodes courtesy of the anomalies, and the sexual relationship between T'Pol and Tucker is exploited for eye candy throughout. Shrann and the Andorians add much to this floundering season and help advance the alliance between humans, Andorians and Vulcans. Overall a slow, disjointed effort and proof that Braga and Berman were out of gas last season.",1469491200,,659,5.111111111111111

This season had a few less than stellar episodes, but the season long Xindi arc and the fifteen episode T'Pol arc more than made up for that.

With good writers, however, it can succeed and become a classic, which is the case with season three of Enterprise. My only complaint is the revised theme song, the faster tempo doesn't do it for me, the slower version is more introspective and melancholy. The special effects are impressive considering this was a TV series on a minor network and the budget must not have been very big.

The original just fit the opening better. The episodes were ok, though I'm not sure the continuing story line helped to keep viewers. I did like that TaPal left the Vulcan command and that they softened her look. That made for some interesting romantic/sexual situations. I have enjoyed the StarTrek: Enterprise series, mostly because it sets the stage for the Original Series... and it reminds me of one of my favorite Star Trek movies, First Contact.

There were no real duds, just weaker stories. Extinction was a standard mcguffin of the week thing. Exile was a little too emo with the alien. North Star would have been a good episode in Season 2 I think. Just out of place.

Proving Ground is where it all started really moving. They brought in Shran. 'Nuff said.

E2 was a good one for me. It was sort of a what if. I like what ifs.

I wonder how the CBS Star Trek TV show will be like. I also love Star Trek Continues... looks so much like for that era... I hope they continue also.

2366504,2,B000A6CLL0,"** Possible Spoilers Below **

The third season of Star Trek: Enterprise picks up where the last episode of the second season left off, with the continuation of a massive Xendi (spelling?) story arc.  I enjoyed the first and second season, with the evolution of Star Fleet and the hints of where humanity would eventually end up in its future with the formation of the Federation.  Unfortunately, there is little of that in the entire third season.

Where to begin on exactly what I dislike about the third season?  First off, the story arc was drawn out for such a length that it could put medieval epics to shame.  There are a few 'bottle episodes' in the season which I guess are supposed to act as a respite from the massive Xendi story arc, but instead of being a welcome distraction, they ended up being a source of frustration.  I often found myself beginning to watch these non-Xendi based episodes in this season thinking, ""I wonder if I could skip this episode and not lose any continuity?""  After about three episodes within this season, I just wanted the Xendi story to come to an end.  Upon the realization that the story would unfold over 20+ episodes, I let out a soft groan and suffered through the rest of season in hopes that the fourth season would be better.

My second and final complaint is character based.  This Delphic expanse, the territory the Xendi occupy, is so dark, morbid, and just plain weird that the characters presented within this place are so at odds with the rest of the Star Trek universe.  Many of the antagonists are so sinister and creepy that on many occasions I didn't feel like I was watching Star Trek - it felt more like the series Farscape (and not in a good way) at those moments.

Character wise our protagonists do not fare well in this Expanse.  They're on a mission to save all of humanity, while the extremely difficult situation that they find themselves in forces them to abandon all of the principles of humanity that Gene Roddenberry hopes will universally take hold within the human race in the future.  Tucker begins the season with a genocidal rage towards all Xendi (which doesn't seem to improve much over time), Captain Archer tortures a captive, and the Enterprise kills defenseless enemies and raids another ship to steal parts so they can complete their all-important mission.  Protagonists in other Star Trek series have made unethical choices as well, but never to the point to where you felt as a viewer that they could not redeem themselves.  Our 'Good Guys' in this season have fallen so far that I now watch Captain Archer, a character that I used to like in the first and second season, with a sense of loathing.  I now have very little interest in these twisted characters.  Why care about protagonists that are almost as bad as the antagonists?  What's the point of saving humanity if you descend to a point of utter inhumane behavior?

I hope season four is better.  But with the way these characters are shaping up, if the Enterprise were destroyed with all hands lost at the end of this season, my reaction would be, ""Good.  They were all jerks anyway.""  Well, maybe not Flox.  He's cool.",1461196800,,3168,4.644524236983842

2366624,5,B000A6CLL0,"Awesome series, seen it many times already. I just had to own it for myself. It's almost as good as STOS",1456531200,,104,4.0
2366625,4,B000A6CLL0,"The Good:
Season 1 and 4 are pretty solid. The guy that plays Trip does a real good job, imo, the best on the show, suprising we haven't seen him in more stuff. I give it 4 stars so hopefully the actors get some royalties, they shouldnt be punished for Braga's lameness.

The Bad:
-Braga's unfortunate influence bogs it down. Just like he did to Voyager with the whole 7 of 9 thing. This guy should never be allowed near the Trek franchise ever again, almost as bad as JJ Abrahms version of Trek.
-The show really suffers not having enough of the old guard around, of course Roddenberry, Taylor and Piller had nothing to do with this one.
-A drug addict, emotionally unstable Vulcan, really? When she didn't have a crappy story to work with Blaloc does a good job being Vulcan. I don't watch much TV for a reason. Always it seems to me the crappy TV shows (most of them), they have people over-acting and lots of screaming or out of control emotions and raised voicces...that happens way too much in this series.
-Starfleet attacking innocent people, raiding thier ship and stranding them in space, essentially condeming 30 innocent bystanders to die? We wouldn't do that now and have laws against it in civilian life, military law (UCMJ) and international law. In the show no one is ever held accountable.
-Some real serious plot holes at times.
-That opening song. Who thought a wannabe Rod Stewart song would be a good idea for Star Trek?
-All the time travel.
-It's heavy on action and pretty people and not so heavy in the moral arguments department, which is a big part of Star Trek.
-Some of their technology is better than what they have in ""Next Generation"".
-Lots and lots of inconsistencies. From plots to technologies. They totally screw up the history of Starfleet, tehy wreck the ""mythology"".
-Almost all of season 3 and the last 1/4 of season 2 , with the whole time traveling/Xindi story arc. It's literally episode after episode in season 3...gets real old real fast.
-An ROTC squad has better judgement then alot of the stuff they have the officers doing. I love Quantum leap, but I just don't think Bakula was a good pick for a captain. The best captains were played by people with a long history in classical theatre. Cause you want that command presence in a captain and a leader. Someone get Archer a chill pill.
-The persistent message that scientists and science & technology are bad. Or even that the Prime Directive is a bad idea is even implied more than once. I'm sorry but, it aint Star Trek without the Prime Directive and a sane Vulcan.

Part of what makes good science fiction good is that it has, at the very least, somewhat believable technology based on real physics. Right? At a minimum it's just enough so that you can suspend disbelief. But I guess if you don't know jack about physics this is hard to do. It's almost like they in fact demonize science. Not a real smart thing to do for Star Trek. I know a lot of the actors don't like the techno-babble as they say, but umm, we like the techno-babble... alot of us do the techno-babble in real life. Who did you think your audience was?

The main reason this one is always rated the lowest out of all Star Trek's is this:
It diverged too much and in too many ways from Gene's Star Trek. Star Trek shouldnt be used as an experimental vehicle for your lame ass ideas. Star Trek is popular because of Gene Roddenberry's vision, once you go away from that, all you got is just another TV show.

If your new to Star Trek, in Gene's own words, Next Generation was the closest to what he wanted Star Trek to be. My words: A progreesive, positive, moral, adventurous space odyssey of humans in a meritocracy. Could it be cheesy sometimes yeah, but at least I never felt like I was watching a crappy soap opera void of any morality or vision. I get that every day here on planet earth......",1456185600,,3870,4.500711237553343

The other annoyance, and it's a reflection of the times post 9/11, is captain Archer's character flaws of standing up moral justifications for his military action to ensure starlet can continue driving something akin to manifest destiny in US in the 19th and 20 centuries.

I've been a big Bakula fan since Quantum Leap. While some of his performances in Enterprise were a bit on the slow and deliberate side, overall he was very effective, as was the rest of the cast.

I enjoyed seeing this series explore some of the theme that we only saw tidbits of in the original Star Trek series, particularly Andorians (who would appear many times in Enterprise, and Orions. I found it to be lots of fun.

Season three featured a very different idea of a Star Trek series ... a season long mission story arc. Not only was the idea very imaginative, but several interesting new alien races were introduced. Very cool.",1453939200,,806,4.476190476190476

The plot is beginning to drag and the effects are getting a little cheesy and if Archer gets the crap beat out of him again this season the doctor should get a Nobel prize for patching him just like new every few days. But it has won me over from the great intro music to the original naivety and eventual jaded desperation. Kick only broke the high ideals for sexy alien women or to recover Spock's brain (little stuff like that) while Archer is moving closer to a marauder with each episode. Hopefully he will redeem himself, after all the stakes are only the future of the universe.
Although the aliens are getting a little cheesy and the plot aging rapidly, they still throw in some gems and interesting twists. Often the secondary story going on in the background is more interesting than the actual adventure. Raising an eyebrow I must say it's interesting how much the Vulcans changed during the next 400 years. Just saying.",1453507200,,1099,4.527638190954774

This is some of the best stuff of all the generations as Captain Archer and the Enterprise crew struggle against forces seeking to make the galaxy uninhabitable by all but them, in the past present and future.  A very grim Scott Bakula ads gravitas to the drama that unfolds. Think The Menagerie (the original pilot for the first gen), the battle against the Borg and the war with the Dominion.  Archer's commitment to save earth has him crossing normal ethical lines in order to accomplish the necessary tasks  Great stuff.",1444348800,,552,4.729166666666667

It explains many aspects of the story in detail that were never explained well, or at all, in the Original Series. The characters are excellent, and the show has enough action to keep viewers from being bored. One of my biggest complaints with Next Generation was that it had very little action, and was boring at times; certainly not the case here!

They always keep me watching who is going to be the lead on what show and how well they perform. None of them missed a beat to keep my interest. I can't understand why some might have criticized Jolene Blalock as T Pol in the series. I thought she was the best Vulcan female ever in movie or series. (It has nothing to do with the way she looks) She just pulled off her character better than anyone else.

2366985,5,B000A6CLL0,I'd still give it 5 stars but the changed a few things from seasons 1 and 2. First they changed the opening theme song. Same song onkyorenupbeat which totally throws me off. Secondly the change the story a bit to be a season long story. In some ways it was great but it also limited their direction. They had still had diversion stories and they did it very well. It was just no longer a week to week toss up. I'm in the middle of watching it for the 2nd time and still think it is awesome. They have more syncs to their characters which didn't need to happen but did make it even more interesting.,1440979200,,598,4.163793103448276

But it's not just action-packed; the characters are fully dynamic.  The addition of the MACOs, Archer's grim resolve, T'Pol's struggles with emotion and addition, Hoshi's battle-hardening experiences, and the constant bickering of Malcolm and Major Hayes, make for supreme character development. Moral crises are abundant (including time travel, Prime Directive, and medical and humanitarian issues) and confront contemporary (and future) issues in new ways.

My only complaint with this season is how I lost sleep because of it: toward the end of season 3, and even extending into the next season, I couldn't watch just one episode!  Great writing!",1437436800,,802,5.392

They don't even have a ""prime directive"", but sort of have to create one as they go along.  Every contact with an alien species is a ""first contact"".  In the third season they attempt to bolster sagging ratings (who wouldn't watch this?) by going into ""the expanse"" to seek a threatening enemy.  Lots of fodder here for fun and interesting episodes.  They even play with the time/space concept quite a bit for you physics fans.  But in that vein, I get how they can move faster than light wit the ""warp field"" but how can they hold audio/visual conversations in real time with earth?

In this season they also they don't have any problems with translation anywhere even though this is a previously unexplored region of space.

2367120,1,B000A6CLL0,"The first three seasons had horrible acting and poor plot lines that didn't quite match the rest of the series. It was painful to watch, but I suspected that and did not attempt this until now, in 2015. I watched it because I felt that to be a complete Trekkie, I had to. I had watched the cartoon when it ran. This was worse than the cartoon. Scott Bakula was definitely the worst captain, even dipping below the character William Windom played. Windom, however, did a good job of playing against his normal work. Bakula was simply horrible, and Captain Archer came off as an uninspiring, single dimensional buffoon without consistent moral fortitude. The only bright spots for me were Conner Trinneer and Dominic Keating. Their characters seemed true to the Star Trek mold. Too much of the writing was taken from the future and not presented as a foundation of the past. How can you introduce concepts that should not have been in play yet? How can events that appeared first in ST:TOS or ST:NG show up a hundred or two hundred years earlier? As a series, it makes no sense, and I will not be adding this one to my collection.",1435968000,,1128,4.561576354679803

2367215,3,B000A6CLL0,"SEASON 3 IS WHERE THE SERIES TAKES A LEFT TURN TO NOWHERE

Enterprise takes a lot of flak for supposedly ruining the Trek franchise. But that is a little unfair overall.

There are some things about Enterprise that don't fit with the general continuity of the rest of the franchise. The main one of those things is the general look and feel of the show. While it looks cool and realistic, it doesn't flow with the rest of the franchise. In the show's defense it does occur 100-200 years before everything else in the franchise. Things are bound to look a little different. But it's also presented in widescreen, where the rest of the franchise is 4:3. But that's really the biggest issue with the series.

But Season 3 gets weird. The show gets slightly retooled and tries to introduce the Xindi as a villain that is hell-bent on destroying Earth because they have word from the future that humans are going to attack them. It's a stupid sub plot that never should have happened. First off the Xindi are 5 different species from the same planet for no apparent reason. Second, the whole ""message from the future"" was supposed to be a running theme of the show that involved time travel from the future visiting the original Enterprise crew. This was supposed to happen a lot, but it never materialized in large quantity. (Rightfully so) So the Xindi time travel plot was left in the show kind of like an orphan story line that served no purpose. Season 3 loses a star for the entire Xindi plot.

But the non Xindi related episodes are great and well worth your time.

It's a well made show. If you watched the rest of Trek you owe it to yourself to bring it home with Enterprise.",1431993600,,1679,4.509868421052632

Another problem is trying to keep up with the plot twists and turns. The stories seem implausible at times and with a few exceptions make no sense. Production value is very good to excellent. The sets are well done and show a lot of design detail, with the exception of the Enterprise. It could have been done a little better. Jolene Blalock's character showed more dimension starting with the third season. Scott Bakula's character was annoying at times and showed little or no development, except he became a lot more angry and short tempered. Four seasons were about right. Although three would have done it also. Again, a well done but not so well directed or written show. Out of all the seasons I would say about eight of the episodes were quite entwining and engaging. I  recommend it to die hard Star Trek fans.",1431820800,,998,4.627118644067797

It really deserves accolades for great acting, staging, writing.  The build up from the 1st and 2nd seasons sets the stage for the 3rd season which is beyond fantastic!  Everything you'd want from a SciFi show and a Star Trek series is packed in that season.  The 4th season is great too, but darker because of the subject matter.  I'm an original Star Trek fan, and I love all the incarnations, but I think this one is by far the best.  It's time period is closest to ours, and is probably truer in concept to what it might really be like to venture into space...more gritty and more unknowns.",1431216000,,712,4.446153846153846

As far as the stories, some are rehashes of good Trek originals while others have a new feeling to them.  The Andorans are probably my favorite alien species.  In Enterprise they have moving tentacles and are generally a neutral ally of Archer much more than Star Fleet.  They call earthlings ""pink-skins"" repeatedly and are typically belligerent but won over by honesty.  (They are also a little darker than sky blue in color...)

2367507,5,B000A6CLL0,"Star Trek Enterprise is the best in the entire canon of Star Trek. The filming and story pacing definitely foreshadowed Battlestar Galactica's new series. The characters were wonderful...
I also enjoyed the decontamination room... Where it appears the only way to rid yourself of unwanted alien microbes was to spend time butt naked rubbing gel all over a hot Vulcan's back. I've picked up microbes many times over the past 10 years, but had to just take Sudafed or Gas-X strips to get rid of them. Never once did a large-breasted alien women rub the gel on me. I'm still waiting, and  I have a feeling I'll be rubbing the gel on by myself in a little while.

Enjoy the show.  Don't text me; it's hard to work the buttons with my hands covered in this gel.",1418515200,,756,4.5036496350364965

2367530,5,B000A6CLL0,"While the first season or two of Star Trek Enterprise were seen as controversial by many Trek fans, those who stuck around until Season Three were rewarded with some of the best Trek since TNG. Season Three sees the crew of Enterprise facing off against the Xindi, a multi-species civilization residing in a dangerous area of space known as The Expanse. This season offers great social and political commentary as the entire season serves as an allegory for the US response to 9/11, and how some in society have a one dimensional view of Muslims as a result of the attacks. Season Three also sees the development of the romantic relationship between Trip and T'Pol, who would become a fan favorite pairing through Season Four.

Season Three of Enterprise has a lot to offer fans and newcomers alike, and brings a return to the Trek traditions of strong character development, social/political commentary, and hard science fiction that embody the franchise.",1415145600,,956,4.975

However, it was do close to it and such a great show, I do t know why they didn't run it for 7 years.  The acting was great, the stories were intriguing!  Some of the best writers of Star Trek penned the episodes!
It is a shame they couldn't get into the Romulan War.  Another year or two in that direction would have been great!

The makeup of the cast keeps bothering me.  We have two aliens, but only one non-American human, and among the Americans, we have one Black and one Asian.  It's not a matter of ""fairness"" or ""political correctness.""  It just doesn't make sense, it's not realistic.  I'm wondering if there isn't an American world empire in this future, with the White minority firmly in charge, ala 1950.",1413676800,,554,4.768421052631579

It does not even begin to epitomize the Star Trek spirit.  Then there's the absolutely horrendous dialogue...omg!!!  I don't even know where to begin THAT discussion.  The acting wasn't always the best either.  Whomever authorized that actor to play security chief must have been high that day.  Don't get me wrong, I like the guy alright and in another role he would have been great.  But he just did not ever fit into that role.

I usually find myself extremely bored with Generations, but I did really like TOS. With all of that said, I thought Enterprise was a very good series with exceptional characters. I loved how there was a ""newness"" of space with little knowledge of what they would find. I thought it was interesting how the first season showed how naive they were about dealing with other species, and learning some hard lessons because of that. As the series progressed Capt Archer became a little tougher and guarded due to earlier lessons. I loved Dr. Phlox with his zoo and his interactions and stories. I do think the ""expanse"" part of the series went a little too long, but it was still a pretty good ride.  I wish the series would have lasted a few more seasons with wider syndication rather than just on UPN. I don't think I even had a UPN station when this series aired originally.",1405209600,,1020,4.454545454545454

Season 3 of Enterprise finally gets into some meaty topics.  Archer having to do anything and everything to complete his mission and save Earth.  Does that mean that he violates those ""Starfleet"" principles that we know from all the shows??  How does T'Pol fare now that she resigned her commission with the Vulcans?

It's as good as any Star Trek series, including the Original. I've heard that Enterprise wasn't on CBS but on UPN. Wonder if not being on a major network would make a difference? If you never watched this series before do so. It takes place 100+ years before the Original series, before transporters, replicators and other technologies were used. It also explains what happened after the Vulcans were the first contact and why Klingons looked very human in original Star Trek.

2367763,4,B000A6CLL0,"With Enterprise Season 3, we not only got a re-branding courtesy of the network, but we also got an attempt to tell a different kind of Star Trek adventure than the normal formula. Despite a few misfires in the run, Season 3 tells a whole story, and leaves us on a terrific cliffhanger.",1401926400,,286,4.415094339622642

2367786,4,B000A6CLL0,"This series is very uneven and meandered without much vision for the first couple of seasons. Some very good shows. Some pretty awful. This season Enterprise gets a real mission that carries it all the way through -- a quest to take out the Xindi , who are bent on destroying the earth. It changes the series and the characters pretty dramatically, with Archer abandoning the touchy feely approach that marked the first two seasons and gaining some backbone. T'Pol taking a more important role. Bakula, who is kind of a wimp, has a tough time doing Jim Kirk but he gives it his best effort.
They kind of jump the shark at the very end of the season, setting up season 4, which is arguably the worst. The final show of that season, the last show in a long parade of Star Trek series, was disappointing beyond words. No wonder they never did another series.
Season 4 is serialized so you must watch each episode in order to follow the storyline, unlike other seasons. But since you can watch it on demand, not a big deal.",1401926400,,1019,4.454545454545454
2367787,5,B000A6CLL0,"This entire season of battling the Xindi to save the earth from annihilation was some of the best drama of all of the Star Trek series.  All of the characters confronted ethical dilemmas that showed their strength of will and determination to the success of their vital mission.  Captain Archer, Trip, T'Pol, Malcolm, Joshua, and Travis were all given opportunities to shine.  Watching T'Ppol a Vulcan struggle with emotions added a depth of character that was masterfully done and mesmerizing to watch.",1401667200,,503,5.109756097560975

2367791,5,B000A6CLL0,I feel this was one of the better star trek incarnations.  Wish they had developed some additional sub plots like T'Pol and Tucker to keep things interesting.  TOS suffers from the same thing mostly because there wasn't a continuous story line as is found in Enterprise.,1401235200,,270,4.8478260869565215

2367793,1,B000A6CLL0,"I am an avowed Trekee.  I loved every minute of Star Trek Enterprise Season 1 and 2.  For some reason either there was a switch in writers or a bunch of them went on steroids.  The entire season and well into the folding Season 4, all the aliens with rare exceptions are fear based and creepy.  The adrenalin is maxed before the first ten minutes.  Frankly, what made Star Trek Enterprise INTERESTING and ENGAGING was the heart centeredness of the captain and complete devotion to his crew as well as the evolving prime directive.  This is completely gone in 3.  Archer is a pain n the backside as a captain, never smiles and is oppressive.  The writers truly lost their way, and lost the opportunity to have multiple seasons beyond and abrupt closure in 4.
Life will go on but I doubt the episodes in S3 and 4 will make it into anyones DVD archives.  I don't think Gene Rodenberry would approve.",1401148800,3,896,4.481481481481482

2367795,3,B000A6CLL0,"While season three was better than seasons one and two it failed to be engaging because they drew out the mission to end the Xindi plot to destroy earth way too long. Half a season would have made it much better. The season felt ""draggy"".

Millions die and there are plenty of explosions but in the end it comes down to a couple basic things. The writing is crap and Scott Bakula is not a good actor. Quantum Leap fit his personality but as Captain of the Enterprise, this show does not.

2367918,2,B000A6CLL0,"I decided to start watching the third season of Star Trek: Enterprise based on a number of other customer reviews, which stated that the 3rd and 4th seasons were better than the first two.  At first, I really enjoyed the whole Xindi plot, and I found that I cared about what happened to the various characters.  But then came the episode where the Enterprise was hijacked by a group of religious zealots.  I was very, very disappointed with this episode, because they took a very simplistic anti-religion line, depicting the Trianonites as misguided and dangerous religious zealots.

And of course, in typical Star Trek style, the key difference between the two religious groups that were fighting a holy war against each other turned out to be very minor and even silly - a difference in how many days they believed the Maker created the Expanse (whether it took the Maker 9 days, or 10 days.)  Similarly, in the Original Series, the difference between two different races that were also at war with each other in one particular episode  was so ridiculously minor as to be laughable.  And this is precisely one of the points I wish to make, and that is Star Trek consistently oversimplifies social issues by making ridiculous comparisons, when the reality in the real world is considerably more complex.  Please note that I'm all in favor of racial equality, but even then, I think we do ourselves a disservice when we pretend that differences between different ethnic groups are minor or nearly nonexistent.

Likewise, differences between religious groups are real and consequential.  Take the differences between Christianity and Islam, for instance.  Christianity insists that marriage is a monogamous union between one man and one woman, whereas Islam allows men to practice polygamy.  Throughout history, every society that has adopted polygamy has ended up with a shortage of women, which explains why many Islamic nations allow young girls to be married.

Furthermore, I really dislike how Star Trek consistently portrays those who have religious beliefs (with the notable exception of the ""Bread and Circuses"" episode) as being ignorant and a hindrance to the development of society.  History shows us that religious people - especially Christians - have brought an enormous amount of good to the world, including the spread of literacy, the improvement of medicine, the rise of modern democracy, the abolitionist movement, the improvement of life for women and children, the birth of the university, the birth of modern science, and a host of other beneficial developments.

This episode disappointed me, and sadly, I must confess I will not be watching any more episodes of Star Trek: Enterprise.",1396828800,,2707,5.106575963718821
2367919,5,B000A6CLL0,I would highly recommend all four seasons of Star Trek Enterprise to any one!  The Xindi plot line took Enterprise into uncharted territory and was highly successful.,1396828800,,166,5.148148148148148
2367920,3,B000A6CLL0,"After doing a ""power watch"" in a few days . I was very disappointed with season 3 . I was very much into the first season the second grabbed me well enough to jump right into the third season . I usually do not read reviews till after I write one but this time I changed up and read a few, the ones I did read all are left me with the same feeling. I am in, now that is this is the worst of the 3 seasons  . The whole season 24 episodes ,are one story line  that should have ended in 12 shows at the most .. out of the 24 shows I would give 6 at most 4-5 stars and that is because of Topal  is  wearing next to nothing and she has a great body .oh and the communication officer was dressed hot for a few shows to . other then this I felt the season signed it's death wish for the show to run for anything more then one more season
I did not see the show weekly when it aired on TV because of work, I think I would have changed to something else , A show like Star Trek really should not be set up like"" 24hrs"" taking a whole season to tell one story/mission . It is because of the other reviews that tell me season 4 was good and better then this season I will move on to it . But if it was network TV ,""lost in space"" re runs be better then this season..
It is a shame the writers lost contact with it's viewers as it is 2014 and there is no Star trek show on or has  been one for years.
I here they are talking and is only talk of a series to come out based on the ""new "" Kirk and Spok but it is talk only . I grew up with the Star Trek shows found the messages on Humanity to be  of great value here in this show the first 2 seasons had  that message on each show but some where in this season it got lost and just became another below par Sci Fi TV  show . Episode 24 leaves us with a closing of NAZI Germany and aliens sounds like they could not think of something new as has not every Series of Star Trek do a show on this.
well I leave you this take it for what it is worth stream line it for free it is okay to watch buying a DVD set of this season and you will become bitter for wasting the money",1396396800,,2105,3.693512304250559

I had just finished watching the first two seasons on Blu Ray. Same Blu Ray Player, Same TV. I started noticing that some of the scenes looked muddy or brownish in the blacks. In other words the blacks were not holding. I don't remember seeing that in the other two seasons. Other than that it looked good.

I must admit the Next Gen Blu Rays have had a mixed bag of great looking episodes and some poorly transferred ones. Enterprise, being more recent, and not having to go thru all the fx upgrades, is a lot more consistent. It does look better than the DVD set of Enterprise did. I did own that.

On TNG it seemed the issues were usually too bright on the bridge, or not holding blacks, but they also look so much better than the DVDs.",1392854400,,870,4.266666666666667

2368015,4,B000A6CLL0,"Season 3 of Enterprise introduced the much-disputed Xindi storyline. Some loved it. Some hated it. Personally, I enjoyed it at first, but thought it dragged on way too long. The Xindi themselves were a fascinating set of races to learn about  so many diverse aliens that came from one planet  who became unique villains.

Standout episodes were: North Star when the Enterprise discover a Human settlement in the Delphic Expanse that seems to be stuck in the Old West. Similitude  when Trip is injured and falls into a coma, a clone is created as a last ditch effort to save him.  Carpenter Street  when the crew travels back to 2004 to stop a Xindi attack. But the vast majority of the season is spent on the Xindi and their superweapon. I actually missed several of these episodes when it was originally on air. So it was nice to go back and catch up. Though, it still felt like the Xindi storyline went on too long. I prefer the standalone episodes of the earlier series. But I still enjoy and appreciate this cast and their chemistry. The good outweighed the negative aspects of the show. So, I gladly watch it again and again. This blu ray edition offers a variety of special features detailed below. Im a sucker for outtakes and deleted scenes. And I enjoyed the Archival Mission Logs for Connor Trinneer and the Xindi Saga begins. A couple of the featurettes are in HD as well.

2368066,5,B000A6CLL0,This series is inter-woven very cleverly with its predecessors story lines and fills in details that were left by the original series and the Next Generation. The third  season appears to change the tone of the space travel experience by becoming more confrontational with the encounters of aliens which cast a dark shadow on he hopes for a more peaceful future. Exploration and discovery becomes mortal combat and changes the character of Jonathan Archer who learns that trusting beings from different cultures is always difficult and dangerous.

Along came Enterprise and it was a love affair right from the start.
What I don't understand is - how does a series that gets better and better from one year to the next get cancelled?
A lot of my friends didn't understand that, either.
The show itself is one of the greatest out there.
It has it all if you are a sci-fi fan, good writers, acting, make-up.
There is science and space ships, rayguns and aliens, what could you possibly NOT like?
The Blu- ray version is great in many ways, although some of it still has a grainy look to it ( I got spoiled, considering I had to watch Star Trek original on a black and white TV),but I am convinced this series will be loved by a lot of people for a long time to come!",1390867200,,795,4.135483870967742

2368071,5,B000A6CLL0,"Enterprise had a nice thought behind it, really. Instead of a fourth show set in the 24th century, why not show humans earlier on, when they're still raw, angry and make a ton of mistakes? Whatever some might tell you human failings have always been a part of Star Trek, even in the utopian style future of The Next Generation and the rest. Still, there was a lot of juicy story material to be discovered by going back in time before the Federation was around, and I can't blame Branon Braga and Rick Berman for heading in that direction. It took them until season three to really find that story, however.

Seasons one and two suffered from feeling like two more seasons of Voyager. We know now that everyone was creatively burnt out and the studio was making weird demands, but even still that's perhaps a poor excuse for so much of Enterprise not really following up at all on the core premise of going back in time and showing a different situation. Seasons one and two felt like the same exact thing we saw before, even in personality and conflict resolution. Finally however, season three comes along and shows us what many were hoping for: raw, young humans fighting to survive in space and not really knowing what they're doing half the time.

To my endless disappointment a lot of Trek fans continue to bash Enterprise for things like an angry, desperate captain threatening a prisoner's life to get information. Or T'Pol not really knowing how to keep her Vulcan self centered on a ship full of humans (or indeed Vulcans being somewhat different than their 100 years later counterparts). These differences from Star Trek forum are what this show was SUPPOSED to do, what it in essence was built to do. Finally in season three we get the interest shake-ups most of us wanted form the beginning.

You probably know the plot: Earth is attacked, the Enterprise heads after those responsible to prevent a devastating second attack. The early episodes set things up nicely: Archer isn't Mr. Nice Guy anymore, he's a space John Wayne out to stop his enemies by any means possible. The crew fall in behind him in varying degrees, with his engineer Trip starting off very bloodthirsty due to his sister being killed in the first attack. The area of space they head into is weird and feels different, the stories suddenly feel like space pirating and lack of alliances are the norm, which is what most expected in a prequel.

In the middle the season goes through a few rough spots as they pad the episode count a bit and get a little too off-mission for a while, but by the second half things ramp up incredibly with some truly epic sci-fi for a television show. Space battles, spy drama, forging alliances and breaking promises. It feels a bit like ""action Trek"" at times, but again the point of this show was to do something different and shake up the formula. If you want peaceful explorers in space there are 17 seasons of the Original Series, Next Generation and Voyager to watch. Enterprise, finally, does something different.

The blu rays are hit and miss. The special features are quite nice, featuring 90 minute documentaries for each season and a nice set of new commentaries and interviews. Season three also has the ""temporal cold war explained"" feature, which offers a nice bit of insight into what else they could have done with that somewhat interesting but wasted plot setup. Sadly the HD transfers, arguably the main reason to buy this, are a little iffy. They're the same HD masters from when the show aired, which was over a decade of technology ago. They look quite good sometimes, far less good other times. They're very soft pretty much all the time and lack deeper blacks and popping colors, but they still look much better than DVD or streaming the episodes. For me having these archived on the more durable blu ray format is also a factor. Choose where you priorities lie.

Enterprise finally shakes things up and feels like a different show set earlier in the timeline starting right here. It's great sci-fi for those without a predisposition of what Trek needs to be. The blu rays are by far the best way to watch the show, and the new special features are quite nice to see. Great stuff.",1390867200,,4217,4.661290322580645

2368104,4,B000A6CLL0,"This season is yet another bizzare tangent in a series with Vast and Plentiful Roots to draw upon, and is yet again a disappointment when viewed by those with real LOVE for the universe dictated so thoroughly through the many other itterations - yet, this season also happens to get better and better as it goes along...
despite the complete disregard for precisely the sorts of subtle allusions we fans of the series crave (and would champion a series forever for) this is without a doubt a season that improves greatly upon the previous disapointments...
In a series that has up to this point ammounted to little more than 'meet aliens, get our A**es handed to us, try a thing, Thing doesn't work, and pathetic resolution'  this season is. at least enthralling and sufficiently complex to involve the viewer in the story...
While the season still struggles, and doesn't really get good till past the halfway point, (to be Awesome in the Last Season) it nevertheless Does begin to get its stride and to achieve episodes that are not obligatory taxations on your previous love of the 'star trek history' to delve into...  Whereas every episode of the previous series are lessons in disappointment and giving them 'one more shot' to get to the next episode, this season does manage to leave me interested in the further story...
Sad to think tho that, for just the sort of apathy Created by the Disregard for the history in the previous two seasons, the slow correction of course this season achieves, only gets one more season to really take flight and soar, untill it again hits the depresing brick wall of bad writing that so abruptly kills the series.
you wouldn't think a series with MILLIONS of Insanely Fanatic Fans could be beaten down by such disregard, and sadly I wish I could get others to pick it back up, but if I do, I will certainly take note that it is not untill the middle of THIS SEASON that they will begin to be engaged...
A long tangent I would rather have seen completed sooner to allow for more of the 'season 4' brilliancy, it is nevertheless the Second Best Season this series has to offer...",1389830400,,2118,4.645333333333333
2368105,5,B000A6CLL0,"As a Trekkie and Trekker, I sometimes feel guilty about my impressions of different incarnations of Star Trek.  I should love everything Star Trek, but I do not.  I love some things more than others.  As a sci-fi fan, what I enjoy the most is a coherent story arc.  Star Trek, as a grand space opera, allows for that arc--but so often individual writers and stories interfere with that arc.  DS9 provides a very coherent arc that carries through much of the series, albeit with a fair amount of skipping forward, especially in the first couple of seasons.  TNG, like Voyager did have the Borg, but again, rewatching them there is a lot of skipping to get to the central arc. That brings us to the third season of Star Trek Enterprise....

The story of the Xindi threat to Earth, the Expanse, time traveling, interdimensional beings, along with the gathering of clues and information leading to a final resolution at the end of the season is the finest effort of Star Trek producers to make just about every episode have some element of the canon and arc.  Now, I cannot say everything was ""edge of the seat"", but the last 4 episodes of the season, and the satisfying resolution combined with another cliff hanger makes this season of Enterprise potentially my favorite of all the series.

I reserve the right to change this opinion since Amazon Prime is providing me the ability to sift through and rewatch DS9 (and truly there was a lot of satisfying canon within DS9)!

Update: 2-5-14  As I have sifted through the central story arc in the 7 seasons of DS9, and move towards the series finale in Season 7, I am thinking that I am about to change my mind.  The episodes dealing directly with the Prophets, along with those integrated with the Dominion War, present the best Star Trek ever.",1389830400,,1790,4.61198738170347
2368106,4,B000A6CLL0,"Let me begin by saying I really love this show and Would give it 5 stars except for one thing....

 The cast is excellent.... The ship and the technical effects are very good... This stories are thoughtful and well written... But....

 It's been done before!!!

 I remember back when this show was first announced. When Scott Bakula was announced as the captain my first thought was great choice! and the cast  around him iwa equally excellent. unfortunately they came about 40 years too late in the universe of Star Trek.

 I am NOT a Trekkie purist.... but most of the missions of this enterprise have been done in the very first series. Gene Roddenberry made that for series a bit of a morality play on the world as most of the Star Trek series are.... but this felt a little too much like a copy.

 sadly I did not have the opportunity to watch the series from the very beginning... and thanks to my Prime membership I'm going to get the opportunity to go back and look at all of it.

 so if you want a good series that's an enjoyable watch and makes you think.... give it a try.",1389830400,,1083,4.355

2368109,5,B000A6CLL0,"Season Three saw 'Enterprise' depart from the single-story format the show had used for its first two seasons.  Up until that point only 'Deep Space Nine' had been able to pull off - and quite successfully, I think, proving they could have done it long before - multi-episode arcs.  Even 'DS9's' arcs had never encompassed an entire season, so the crew of 'ENT' really took a chance.  It's easy as a fan to sit back and look at the decisions that were made and say ""oh the series may have last longer if they had done this or that, or maybe if they had started doing story arcs in the first or second season...""  No one can really say for sure.  I enjoyed most of the first two seasons, with the exception of a few notable episodes.

The Xindi storyline was bold.  Having five distinct species on the same planet all develop intelligence simultaneously provided the writers with a lot of different material to work with.  A year-long mission to save Earth and humanity from extinction, forcing the characters into pressure-cooker situations ... really gave the show the raw edge I think it was supposed to have from the very beginning.  We were able to experience the darker facets of the characters' emotions as they pretty much unraveled.  Many folks did not like the inclusion of the Temporal Cold War (at all) into the Xindi Arc.  Personally I loved the Temporal Cold War story, and it made perfect sense in this season.  Considering the NX-01 hadn't traveled very far it had to be explained how and why this crew could counter enter the Delphic Expanse, yet have the expanse not exist in the 24th century.  It explained the existence of the Suliban, the Sphere Builders, why the Expanse no longer existed in the time of TNG, DS9, and VOY.

Like the previous Blu-ray Trek releases, this season contains the Season Three DVD special features.  It also contains four newly-produced documentaries.  Three parts are sectioned off into a doc called ""In A Time Of War,"" which features the actors, the writing staff, some members of the production staff, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman all discussing the creation, implementation, and consequence of the direction Season Three took.  I always enjoy these documentaries, whether on the ENT or TNG sets (and I look forward to them on the future DS9 and VOY sets), because I enjoy hearing the points-of-view of everyone involved in the creation process.  The recollections are always fascinating.  The final documentary is called ""Temporal Cold War Declassified.""  This doc explores the concepts behind the temporal cold war storyline, possible reasons it wasn't as well received as it could have/should have been, and like the other docs features interviews with cast and creators.

As always the remastering quality of these sets is fantastic; Season Three of 'Enterprise' is no exception.",1389571200,10,2834,4.874739039665971

But just as lamentable was the fact that I became less interested in the story as it unfolded. The plot line might have made an interesting episode, but it dragged on for a whole season, needing to be sparked up a bit with romance between Trip and T'pal (really?).

It looked like the directors were looking for a way to draw in more audience, rather than sticking with a stable vision. L'var Burton's episodes were more traditionally set and designed.
The romance between Trip and T'pol could have been developed more consistently over the season as well, rather than hit or miss.
The overall season plot of the Xindi conflict was a good idea, and I especially liked the zombie Vulcans episode, an advanced story for its time.
In summary, though initially incongruous and directionless, the season settled down into a solid story, notable for its increased violence in the era of the Second Iraq War.",1378512000,,776,4.976923076923077

2368318,3,B000A6CLL0,Of the four seasons this one is the worst. They got sidetracked with a plot that involves an alien race(s) called the Xindi that makes you wonder why you should care. This was overly clever with five symbiotic (but not really) races of bad guys that in the end was two that were being deceived by yet another hidden race. This is the same thing that happened to Deep Space Nine. They became too clever and soon the viewer had no idea what race was what and didn't care.

This last season is very much in the theme of the 24 series with Keifer Sutherland.  Each show is a cliff hanger that tells a bit more of a much larger story.

I never saw the series when it first came out (my work schedule didn't jive with TV).  But since I have Amazon Prime, I can watch what I want when I want.

I don't watch much of the current TV programming, because it is mostly C$%P these days.  But Star Trek has decent morals and good wins out over evil, though it must struggle to do so.  Even my wife is enjoying it.",1372550400,,655,4.094488188976378

It fills the screen in 1:1.78 (16 x 9) format (i.e. - widescreen), but it was not as crisp as I know it can be.  None-the-less it's still quite good.",1372550400,,423,4.2625

""Similtude"" was an interesting episode involving a very short lived clone of Trip.

I could watch this entire season over again.",1370390400,,432,4.697368421052632
2368353,5,B000A6CLL0,"A very underrated series that is the ""prequel"" to the rest of the Star Trek shows and movies.  Season 3 has a running, cohesive theme through the whole season, and continues the solid cast performance and strong plot lines of season 2. There's even more action, and we start to see a few more esoteric episodes such as one that takes place in Detroit of 2004 (the year the episode was filmed).

Enterprise is approachable for non-trekkies, but Trekkies will love it.  Strong acting, interesting plots, nice graphics (for the time), and a lot of precedent-setting stuff happening before the Federation existed.  Unlike Voyager (the prior series), there's a lot less ""how could they be that stupid??"" moments.  All those times you watched Voyager and were annoyed by all the stuff they didn't do-- when they didn't fight back, when they talked slowly instead of firing, when they were defeated by virtually everything they encountered and were usually saved by accident or by outside forces rather than their own efforts and skills?  This show doesn't do that.  You think ""Captain Archer should punch that guy in the face!"" and lo and behold, Captain Archer does punch that guy in the face!  The lack of bumbling makes this series feel much more real, and much more watchable.

I briefly watched ""Enterprise"" when it first aired, but broadcast was a terrible way to watch shows like this.  Streaming in HD without commercials makes for a far superior experience.

I'm not sure what the specific cause of the cancellation was, but it was a serious loss to science fiction on television. A number of folks only consider the final season to be good. I completely disagree. What seasons 1-3 of Enterprise show is the human race, struggling, making poor decisions as we do, trying to find its way in a universe far more complex than it initially could fathom. As with all good science fiction, this series provokes all sorts of philosophical questions: What does it mean to be human? Should utilitarianism be allowed to override other moral and ethical principles valued by a culture, and if so, under what circumstances? What are the limits of moral relativism? Is morality something that should be imposed, or at least presumed to exist in other species? This series is entertaining all the way through, and I think they did a great job of keeping the slow burn of T'Pal and Trip's relationship just barely smoldering as both struggle with what a relationship would even mean for the both of them. As opposed to The Next Generation (which is a fine series), Enterprise is far more interesting because you are witnessing such a protean endeavor, and like an infant, the human race shown here often stumbles and falls, but never gives up.",1368921600,,1367,4.772151898734177

However, the introduction of the Xindi as a collective of different species and their terrorist attack on earth is one of the better story lines I've seen in televised science fiction.  There's also an episode which again brings in the Andorians, who provide another excellent addition to the evolving relationship between Archer and the Andorian commander Sran.  Archer pushes his crew and ship to the limits of endurance in a relentless push to head-off Earth's destruction by the Xindi.

2368658,2,B000A6CLL0,"...but that's not saying much.  When the writing had a chance to take off, it meandered.  It never really dealt with the science of the Expanse, or of any of the races that were trying to live under it.  (The writers barely dealt with science at all.)  In the TOS storyline, the immediate history proceeding that series had several wars - including the genetic war of Kahn fame that should have just happened - that would have logically made a pretty tougher Capt. Archer than even the one presented in this third year.  Instead, they seemed to have modeled this guy on The X-Files' Mulder.  If the truth be told, this series seemed to have a lot of envy for The X-Files and Star Wars. (The Zindi Council seemed to be lifted out of Star Wars II - Attack of the Clones.  I had expected maybe there was a Zindi race of robots, too.)

This season seemed to be about saving the show...which, it turned out, it didn't.  I had this feeling that the creators of the show thought that if they expressed the frustrations that the audience felt with many of the on-going storylines that the series adopted - say by making Capt. Archer be snarly with Crewman Daniels - that they would get the audience more into the show.  They re-developed a bunch of the characters including the Capt.  (T'Pal smoking a crack pipe?!!?)  In my opinion, the only one that worked was Trip's development - he was definitely a lot less annoying. (Imagine, a chief engineer that has to stay on the ship, and engineer!) But, again, that's not saying much.

Many of the side storylines also seemed underdeveloped.  The space Jihad story was probably the worst ever written for a Trek series.  The alien cowboy story also left something to be desired.  Staying on the last story for a moment, why wasn't any effort spent to try and find out what the continued exposure to the Expanse would do to humans by studying it's effect on the cowboys?  Were the writers into this storyline?  Especially with their efforts on the cowboy and Jihad stories, it didn't seem like it.  The Jihad story was too topical, and not very well thought out.

The Idea of having a prequel to TOS was a hugh selling point for me to watch the first season of the show back in 2001.  It was a big disappointment as far as I was concerned.  Further, with what was going on with 9/11, my focus wasn't on sci-fi, it was on friends going to war.  I thought I was a little unfair to some of the early shows of this series due to the distraction of 9/11, and that I would in later years have a chance to look at the reruns, and be able to get caught up in the show.  So far, I've taken the last year to go over the first three seasons, and I'm sorry to say that my first opinion was spot on.",1362873600,,2723,4.346534653465347

2368742,4,B000A6CLL0,"Some excellent episodes in this season.  Much superior to the previous seasons and a great storyline that extended through the season.  The Xindi are an alien species intent on destroying Earth; in fact, all humanity.  Archer and the crew of the Enterprise are sent to stop the Xindi from building a planet buster weapon that they will use to destroy Earth.  (Planet destroying weapons seem all the rage these days... since the Death Star introduced them in you-know-what)  To accomplish their assignment, the crew of the Enterprise must cross the Delphic Expanse, a sector replete with spatial and time anomalies that plague the Enterprise and it appears the ship may not even reach the planetary systems of the Xindi.  To further complicate matters, it turns out that the anomalies of the Expanse are due to objects, spheres, being constructed by the Sphere Builders, another race of aliens who are not only alien to our civilization but are actually alien to this universe.  There are great Xindi characters introduced and since the Xindi are composed of four separate races, insectoid, reptilian, aquatic and humanoid, there is opportunity for some excellent special effects which are done magnificently.  And there is the Andorian, Shran, whose character is played by Jeffrey Combs, who steals the show in a couple of episodes.  This season could have been made into a very good movie by some judicious editing (especially taking out several episodes that did not further the Xindi plot).  If you enjoy good space opera and Star Trek is not anathema to you, well worth watching.  I enjoyed it.  Even the ""filler"" episodes were pleasant enough.",1360454400,,1648,5.040590405904059

2368944,4,B000A6CLL0,"First off this was a great episode, the beginning act had a real cowboy space feel (like something from the Star Wars cantina, or Firefly). The following couple of points are just things that don't add up for me (warning it's me being critical):

Some logic problems with the Xindi ""destroying Earth"" arc.

1) It's not that hard to destroy a planet....by the year 1960 we already had enough nuclear weapons to destroy our own...C'mon in the 26th century (Xindi from the future) they should have a single little missile that can annihilate a solar system.

2) Even if you destroy Earth, Humans have terra-formed and spread out on cargo and space-ships throughout the galaxy....these are some of the brightest most ambitious Humans too. You know they will want revenge and will be capable of delivering it. The Xindi are just setting themselves up for destruction again.

3) As I said previously why did they do a ""test death ray thing"", just to give the Humans time enough to come after them? And why didn't they test it out on San Fran (AKA Star Fleet HQ)? Ugh...plot devices..

Sometimes I wish I was dumb and unperceptive so I wouldn't so easily notice these things. The show is still very entertaining and I love a good story arc and a ""bad guy"", so of course I'm still gonna watch (and it's free to me).",1344038400,,1307,4.592274678111588

I would say that this episode, however, is interesting in that it is not necessarily a ""back in time"" episode but rather a glimpse into the past. It follows a simple premise of alien abduction that leads to human overthrowing of said aliens and subsequently living life as if it still were the 19th century.

The Vulcan ship contains the erstwhile crew mates of Sub-commander T'Pol as it was her latest posting before joining Archer's command.  Something has gone wrong, for the crew lives but doesn't seem willing to save themselves.  The away team including T'Pol finds the Vulcans in a disturbed, violent state and wholly incapable of reason.

Not that I mind that so much, but I feel it is needlessly done as I don't recall that many TOS episodes with Spock undressed. Moreover, I feel it takes away from her fine acting which is the most impressive of all the actors. Why take away from her acting by so much sensuality of her body. No doubt they could have just made a show with her rubbing lotion on her body for a full hour and called it Star Trek/Baywatch. I like her looks too, but come on. That aside, it is becoming a well written show with touches of qualities that lead to a lasting appeal. I find I am more and more addicted to the show and what is going to happen to them all.

2369006,5,B000A6CLL0,"Like another reviewer, I was pretty burnt out on new Star Trek franchises when Enterprise (ENT) first debuted.  When I sampled the first season, at the time, I definitely felt it was realllllly cheesy.

But now -

With the entire show on instant video, I figured I'd give ENT another shot.  I decided to start as far from season 1 as possible.  So I began with season 4, which I loved - really reminded me of some of TNG's best episodes.  On to Season 3, in my reverse viewing of this series!

Season 3 of ENT combines all of the best elements of the original Star Trek, TNG, and DS9.  There are excellent episodes on social issues, exploring ideas such as collective responsibility and genocide, as well as stem cell research and right to life, amongst others.  At the same time, the writers came up with a genius plot device for the whole season:  Enterprise must track down a new alien threat by exploring a new area of space known as 'The Expanse.'  Not only does this give a long-term story arc for 23 episodes (much like the best parts of DS9), but it also lets ENT explore a whole new part of the Star Trek universe, without worrying about changing the canon, etc. etc.  This gives a rich context for a lot of neat Star Trek style story-telling.  If you're a fan of the franchise, you'll probably recognize the nods to previous plot devices - I found this endearing, and not at all derivative).

Finally, the cast of this show really seem to fit their characters.  I was never able to dig Voyager b/c...well, nearly all the characters and/or actors annoyed the hell out of me.  Don't know why, but they just did.  This set of characters (and its matching cast) really shine in season 3 - many characters have to face difficult decisions that make them a little less polished, and a little more real (as the reimagined Battlestar Galactica famously did, to an even larger degree).

I have to say, as this season progresses, I admire more and more of the writing.  There are many small touches of continuity in the story arc that delight the attentive viewer, endear the characters to you, and feel like classic Star Trek.  Most importantly, however, they successfully turned what was a kind of hokey series in season 1 (in my opinion, at least) into a show that takes itself just seriously enough to be admired while still entertaining.

If you're a Star Trek fan of other shows, this season is a great introduction to ENT.",1318896000,,2429,4.537931034482758

2369011,4,B000A6CLL0,"I am a die hard star trek fan ( the original series) but like most people suffered from some burn out by the time Enterprise came on the air.  After starting the Amazon instant video I decided to find out what people were saying about all of the star trek series that were now available to watch.  When I read that people enjoyed season three of Enterprise I decided to check it out.  Man, I really enjoyed this continuing one year long story.  IMO its some of the best star trek out of any of the new shows.  There is more compelling character development and sense of urgency and suspense than has ever been in any of the other cold and politically correct shows such as TNG and Voyager. They actually made the story of the impending destruction of the earth by the alien Xindi exciting and the ships search in an unknown and unstable area of space to find and stop the alien weapon very addictive viewing.  I was really surprised by the evolution of the T'pol vulcan character and her change from stoic arrogant vulcan to emotionally scarred and loyal crew member.  Her arc involving her addiction to a mineral deadly to vulcans and its permanent affect on her emotional stability was fun to watch. Plus it was fun to follow her struggling with her feelings for Trip tucker and captain archer.  Archer was forced to make some hard decisions that were a deviation from the usual preachy good guy stance of other shows.  I always find it annoying when the new shows have the crew do everything they can to accomodate the vast array of alien jerks and bend over backwards to show how peacefull humans are.  This season the stakes are the destruction of the earth so Archer chucks that PC stuff out the window and gets nasty ( a few times) in order for the mission to succeed.
I really believe that if this show had followed TNG instead of deep space nine then it would have been more popular. Not that Im a DS9 basher...I thought the last two seasons of that show were great as well.

I haven't seen DS9 so can't comment on it. I wish the time travel plot had been extended and I wish the series ending had not been so dark, otherwise no complaints. I can't believe it only ran 4 seasons; there were so many stories that could have been told. It was extremely interesting to see how the writers linked the events in Enterprise w/ the those in the series that came before.

2369074,5,B000A6CLL0,"Star Trek Enterprise Season Three is one of my favorite Star Trek adventures and it measures up favorably to the great Trek series like TNG, DS9 and Voyager.

The Xindi - the alien protagonists of the third season - are one of the most creative alien constructs of all time. They are a race of five different species; humanoid, reptilian, insectoid, aborial and aquaduct. There was once a sixth species, the now-extinct avians.

Season Three begins with a terrorist attack on Earth from an unknown source. Seven million are dead from the attack which was delivered by a giant aerial sphere of tremendous power that cut a deep and wide swath from Florida to Venezuela.

Enterprise is charged with finding who attacked Earth and why. The Vulcans retrieved the spent sphere and turned it over to Star Fleet Command for analysis, including the strange, alien pilot who was found dead within the sphere.

The Enterprise must search through a region of space known as the Expanse, an area rife with dangerous spatial anomalies that the Vulcans have known about but except for a video record of a Vulcan ship and crew destroyed by the anomalies have very little information about.

Captain Archer is contacted by a time traveler from the future, Daniels, who gives him information on the attackers, the Xindi. The Xindi have been manipiulated by a culture with time travel technology to believe that if they don't destroy the human race they will in turn be destroyed by humans in the future.

Enterprise sets out to discover where the Xindi are and to stop an even larger version of the killer sphere, one that will totally destroy Earth once it's  deployed.

The crew of the Enterprise makes surprising allies - and enemies - along the way while trying to save Earth from certain and complete destruction.

The Xindi adventure arcs through the entire third season culminating with the heartpounding episodes The Council, Countdown and Zero Hour.

2369079,4,B000A6CLL0,"Enterprise is like the red-headed stepchild of the Star Trek family. There's even a notable amount of die-hard fans who refuse to admit that it's part of Trek at all. I had no interest in this series while it was on the air, and only started watching it after seeing, and thoroughly enjoying, a rerun from the forth season I beleive. Now I have watched every episode in the series and while it certainly had its share of bombs I have come to enjoy the show much more than I did Voyager.

Enterprise is a consistantly well-written show with characters you actually get to know and care about; unlike Voyager which rarely had any of those traits during its seven seasons versus four with Enterprise. Season Three involves the Xindi arc, lasting the entire season, which IMO was an interesting idea that I feel pays off story-wise. While there were a few epsiodes not directly related to the overall plot with the Xindi that were downright terrible, the rest of the season makes up for them nicely. In regards to individual eps, I thought season 4 was better, but S3 was also quite good and had some of the best eps of the series.

If you're a fan of ST and have yet to involve yourself in Enterprise, as well as having the intention of doing so of course, I would say that even though it isn't necessary to understanding S3, start from the beginning. On the other hand, if you've already been initiated into the series S3 is great due to the fact it follows only one primary plotline, much like the Dominion War on DS9 but with far less side-plots.",1264723200,,1546,4.4787234042553195

The cast is brilliant but Bakula's performance really stands out.

2369081,2,B000A6CLL0,"I stumbled upon the original Star Trek series as a kid in it's initial run in 1966. The episode was ""Devil In The Dark"". A story about silicon based beings, and learning to appreciate and cohabitate with them. I've since seen every episode of every Star Trek incarnation, most of them multiple times. The point is, I have some credentials.

What made Star Trek soar, was that it was a show of IDEAS. And it was pretty much the first sci-fi space show where the aliens didn't come out blasting, in a bid to exterminate humanity for whatever fear-based goofy reason. People who were tired of the old warn out themes of good guys vrs bad guys, now had a place to turn. Gene Roddenberry was a thoughtful visionary, who humbly loved the fans, and genuinely believed in Star Trek, and the better angels of humanities hopes and dreams that it represented. He was hands on through every episode of the original Star Trek, and Next Generation. And he brought in a variety of top notch writers with great ideas.

When Gene became ill, Rick Berman took over. Gene never liked Rick due to his arrogange, and incredible disdain for the fans. Rick never shared in Gene's vision, and treated the audience as simpletons and sheep, churning out half-hearted off-handed scripts. After Gene died, Rick became increasingly disrespectful of the Trek tenets.

With Enterprise, Star Trek became yet another two-dimensional comic book good guys vrs bad guys show. Nowhere was this more evident, than with the Xindi saga. Ideas took a back seat. Further, imagination was undercut with the whole premise of Enterprise. With space exploration, people want to explore the frontiers, not go way back in time to the beginning. Who wrote Enterprise? Rick Berman, and his right hand yes-man Brannon Braga. Only at the end, with the shows ratings sinking like a stone, did they bring in some talent. Too little, too late.

I love Star Trek, but putting bias aside, and taking off the rose colored glasses, Enterprise was a bad show that sullied the great Star Trek name, and for the most part, you can pin that squarely on Rick Berman. I thank the lord he had nothing to do with the new Star Trek movie. Memorable quote. Rick and Gene are walking across the Paramount lot, and Rick says pompously waving his hand ""See all these people, they all work for ME"". And Gene replied ""Funny, they all worked WITH me"".

2369114,3,B000A6CLL0,"Summary:
Awesome cast, great atmosphere, but the quality of the stories varies from the best
that science fiction has to offer to the most boring imaginable.

Main review
The concept of a series taking place shortly after the First Contact Movie is a brilliant idea. But it seems a long way from the idea to realisation. Already at the end of the pilot (Broken Bow) I missed the greatness this concept potentially has. You get thrown into ""business as usually"" (rescuing, exploring etc.) way too soon. I would have loved a pilot movie plus some more shows describing the time from first contact to the launch of Enterprise. That would have been something truly new. But this pilot is just an extended version of a 08/15-show.

The cast delivers frequently - Scott Bakula is on hell of as sovereign captain, Jolene Blalock is sexy as she is intelligent and plays T'Pol with a huge amount of depth. I could continue endlessly with Phlox, Hoshi, Trip, Malcolm...  It's an outstanding team with no need to fear comparison with a Picard, Spock, Scotty...
The set designers and the costume designers all did a great job (thanks for avoiding more romper suits).

But it is difficult when there are too many boring scripts.
Especially in the first two seasons contain too many shows following the pattern:
""Landing on an alien world, been taken prisoner, making an escape."" Even the visit to Risa follows this.
Also there is ""being boarded, been held hostage, chasing away the enemy"".
Then there are some episodes like ""Shuttle pod one"". The whole show consists of a rather dry talk between Malcolm and Trip. I can't imagine something more boring.
And a lot of the shows contain just a recycled script from ""Next Generation"", ""Deep Space 9"" and ""Voyager"", such as ""Terra Nova"", ""Sleeping Dogs"", ""Dawn""...

But on the other hand you can't skip those episode - they sometimes contain important information on the characters. Therefore the waiting for the good and outstanding episodes is somewhat painful. These are the shows ""The Andorian Incident"" (I love the duplicity of the Andorians and there development into the 4th season) , ""Shockwave"", ""First Flight"" and the continuing plot about the Xindi (finally a few more star battles than in TOS, TNG and DS9).

Then when the series was already near its death the 4th season hit with power. The plot about the Augments could have been an Oscar-winning movie, and so would have been the story about the Vulcan's not been that perfect after all. The Andorians continue to deliver and the racial conflict with ""Terra Prime"" is the kind of stuff I waited 4 seasons for.

Conclusion
Seeing the 4th season there is defiantly potential for three more seasons.
But with the experiences of the first two seasons I can't blame the network for discontinuing the show.

I bought the slime line boxes and paid for each 13 British Pounds (18 US-Dollar). If I had paid the regular price for the first editions (80 Dollar) I would have been very upset.",1236988800,,2977,4.812133072407045
2369115,5,B000A6CLL0,"Long time Trek fan. I've seen all of the movies and every episode of every show (even every Enterprise - how many Trek fans can say that?), and the Xindi season probably stands as the most solid overall season of a Trek show (though a few DS9 seasons come *really* close). I have to hand it to them for pretty much ignoring Trek lore and trying something outright new after 2 shaky seasons under their belt and, other than a few references to existing canon and Andorian appearances, this season can stand well on its own as a good science fiction story arc even if you aren't familiar with Enterprise or even Trek itself. Some Trek fans didn't like that, I thought it was brilliant.

Once you get past the inane premise of Starfleet being made aware of the Xindi threat by their making a direct attack on Earth as a preliminary test for their doomsday weapon (actually happened as the finale of season 2), the rest of this season unfolds in a well paced and laid out storyline, with even the diversion stories meaning something in the end. The concept of the Xindi themselves, 5 different species (humanoid, arboreals, insectoid, reptilian, and aquatic) all originating from the same planet and evolving together (and a 6th technically, avian, though extinct and didn't make it to the present time of the story arc). Very diverse and conflicted, yet all unified in a common bond - the destruction of Earth and the (future) Federation which they have been led to believe will destroy them. The effects are top notch, especially considering all of the Xindi races have their own technology and look as well. The aquatics alone, as a non humanoid species living in water, would have been impossible to do on a tv budget even a few short years earlier. The Enterprise itself even takes progressive damage throughout the year - none of that ""all fixed, everything is better"" at the beginning of the next episode - they are forced to deal with their damage and limitations while cut off from most all of their allies while in the Xindi Expanse.

Go for season 4 of Enterprise if you're looking for more true canon prequel Trek (esp. the Mirror Universe eps featuring the Tholians) - if the first two seasons had been anything like the last season (4), or the third season of Enterprise had been the first, the show might have gone to 5-7 seasons.

As it stands though, if you just want to give Enterprise itself a try, go with season 3. It'll stand on it's own.",1228176000,3,2456,4.602739726027397

2369117,4,B000A6CLL0,"The Star Trekkie, whose continuing mission is to seek out every Star Trek Episode, to boldy go where no one has gone before: to watch every single episode, in chronoligical order, from Enterprise to TOS to TNG to... well, you get the idea. Seasons 1 and 2 went fairly well, whereas, halfway through season 3, I discovered my own breaking point and had to take a 6 week sabatical from battling the Xindi...

In short, I found the cliche that ultimatly cost Enterprise its 5th season. Oh, I loved the T'Pol-Trip romance, which is one of the more interestuing ones in the series(es) being wrought out of almost complete emnity. And, frankly, loved even more the twist Archer took as he started to do ""what is nessicary"" for the survival of Enterprise and Earth in a story arc remincesant of ""In The Pale Moonlight"" from DS9's 6th Season. But there were problems. I never did much get exactly where the Xindi came from, even if it does have soemthing to do with the Temproal Cold War, no more than I ever got the Suliban plotlines.

In essence, a vaild addition to the Enterprise story, perhaps better than the first two seasons in that it has a darker and grittier feel then even the first - ie, a more resonant, modern feel than the idealic episodes of TOS or the 1-story-resolutions of TNG - that deeply asks the questions of ""What is right?"" ""What is nessicary?"" and ""What is good?"" for all charectors, most especially T'Pol and Archer, ending in a clasic cliffhanger... Though the story gives, these very reasons also detract the classic fan in much the way the Dominon War cost DS9. Still, a worthy watch. 1 at a time.",1224547200,,1620,4.563573883161512

2369193,5,B000A6CLL0,"I'm a fan, right from the start with Kirk and company. I was annoyed when ST:TNG came out, because I thought, ""How could they?"" But I gave it a fair chance, and loved it! Next DS9, haven't had the chance yet, but will eventually get to it (wasn't thrilled with the whole ""war"" premise). When Voyager came into the spotlight, I was skeptical yet again, figuring it couldn't have the real ""Star Trek feel"" being stuck in space. I didn't even watch it initially. But it is an excellent show too! Now to Enterprise - I swore to myself I'd give it a fair chance the first time around, and watched it religiously and in much anticipation for each coming week. I enjoyed the show while I was watching it, but found it to be hard to follow - especially with the multiple story arcs throughout the last two seasons. Being the devoted fan, I had to have it when it was released on DVD. I only recently opened and viewed each season, episode after episode and let me tell you, watching it in this manner made a lot of sense! I had come to realize how intricate the plots can be, the characters, multi-demensional, and the effects are truly amazing. The writers took a big, bold chance with continuing arcs, and that was a nice nod to the fans. They were not trying to carefully step on eggshells and write individual stories. They were giving a gift to fans, knowing those who were following each week would be the only ones returning for the next installment. Watching one eppy after the next, I was like, ""Wow!"" that's good writing! The characters were as they should be - newbies in the universe, and not knowing quite how to proceed. They were flawed, made bad (and good, really good) decisions. They learned from their mistakes and experiences, and grew accordingly - but never lost sight of the qualities that Roddenberry had envisioned for future of the human race.",1214179200,,1861,4.525222551928783
2369194,4,B000A6CLL0,"I have to say I didn't realize the show had so much trouble with low audiences and budgets until I read the official review. We watched and recorded it avidly when it was a regular program. I bought Enterprise season 3 as a Mother's Day gift for my wife -- we already own the first two, and I'm giving her season 4 for her birthday.
We've been Star Trek fans since Picard and The Next Generation, but this is the best of the bunch, in my opinion. Season 3 exemplifies all the qualities that make Enterprise top of the heap -- great writing and acting in almost every moment of every episode. Archer ranks right up there with the other captains though his obsession with the Xindi threat (a logical response) sometimes makes him seem one-dimensional. The strong ensemble, however, makes up for that -- they all take turns as main characters in episodes and come off looking pretty good.
My family and I enjoy the trips back in time, especially one to earth's past (that life looks frighteningly familiar!) and one to transplanted earth natives trapped in the wild, wild west culture.

2369195,4,B000A6CLL0,"I purchased the entire 4 season set but will review Season 3 only here.  The things I really enjoyed about this set of 7 discs:
The features.  The special features on disc 7 and the individual, full length episode commentaries on some episodes are well worth the price of the set.
The Xindi.  I can't believe I am saying that since I wasn't very impressed by the Xindi arc and species when the episodes aired.  Now that I have the opportunity to see these creatures and their spacecraft over and over, in freeze frame and slow mo and to learn more about their development I am thoroughly enjoying them.  Caution though -- some of these species could be nightmare material (lol)when studied in depth like this.  But hey, it's great fun!
The thing I guess I didn't like has nothing to do with the product but rather with the show itself.  I did not like the direction many of the characters took (or rather the writing of them).  There seemed to be a lot of token violence, sexuality, and attempts to relate to current events.  I prefer my ""Star Trek"" to tell stories true to its own realm and not be infiltrated by the values (or lack thereof) of the real world.  I must say that these changes made for some interesting episodes, and having the opportunity to study these independently, hear commentary and get behind the scenes made even the crazy episodes worth watching again and again.",1211673600,,1388,4.560483870967742

Charles Tucker Tripp, the chief engineer, to replace some brain tissue so he can be revived form a coma that resulted from an injury in time to save the ship stranded in a part of the expanse that is rapidly accumulating magnetic debris on it. Yes, I am a huge Tripp fan (I wish he would improve his website). I also love the episode where he and T'Pol have to strip down and rub antibacterial gel on themselves while in quarantine for most of a day, and the other episode where he accompanies her to Vulcan for a marriage. We can'y ever get enough Vulcan stuff. She is hot. I had to write this review after someone gave it a C-. No, sir, it is definitely an A, and one of the best ever, along with the 2 mirror universe episodes that were way too brief. I thought they had redesigned the show because of fan feedback, and I buckled my seatbelt for a ride-- man, was that exciting in season 4. I had missed these season 3  until after seeing  season 4, and was very impressed by the Vulcan Zombies. Ya, the Zindi stuff was a bit too drawn out, but I would say that Similitude was one of the top 10 of them , or even the top 5. We get to see Trip mature from an infant in a few days to an adault and fall in love with T'Pol. It was very endearing and emotionally touching. An excellent performance, almost as cool as ST III The Search For Spock movie, where  younger Spocks are seen maturing rapidly. Man, I can't believe the two of them did not show up for the Farewell Party. I was not too crazy about the  Eugenics episodes with Dr. Soong, but it was very cool seeing real Orion green slave women and Cold Station 12 was pretty good, with its biowarfare stuff. By the way, the episode about Dr. Phlox being kidnapped by the Klingons to cure their plague was very cool, explaining the enigma of the Klingons without ridges, of which FAFSA corp alluded to in their now-defunct role-playing game. (Obviously, this relates to more than season 3, but I had to mention how good ""Similitude"" was, and squeeze in my whole review in 1 shabang). This would be a great opportuity for Atari, the exclusive ST game licenser for several years, to revive the unfinished original series game ""Secret of Vulcan Fury,"" from the now-defunct pc game company, Interplay, the intro for which can be viewed on either the CD-Rom set or the DVD version, or the Action-Pack edition with add-ons, of Star Trek Starfleet Academy-- 1 of the best 3 ST games ever (along with KA and EF). (I plan to go on a crusade for this when I get time- feel free to contact me, anyone, if interested in campaigning to see this game completed). But, back to Enterprise, it is one of the best shows ever (and thank goodness the shows only had on ferengi episode). And, yes, we needed more Tellarites (pig people), and they should have had Alpha Centarians-- but at least we got to see green orion slavewomen and blue Andorians (love the antennae) and their telepath subrace (man, was that ever cool). It is too bad they also had no 3-legges, 3-armed Edoans, with their orange skin and concave heads and yellow eyes , or any Catians (cat people-- these can be seen, among other places, in the animated series). P.S.: Koodos to Sulu for coming out-- that took guts. Paramount: we need more green-blooded Vulcan artwork for sale!",1180483200,,3454,4.409090909090909
2369234,5,B000A6CLL0,"Enterprise Season Three has been touted as one long episode, and I have to agree, but I liked it just the same. Yes there weren't 20 something  episodes about different planets, exploring space, meeting and greeting resident and hostile alien species. This was one season, full of one basic storyline, saving earth from the xindi weapon. Crossing into the expanse was as if the crew was crossing into ""junior"" year of space school, no more fun and games its time to get serious and think about the future. We get to see the crew of the enterprise grow both internally and closer to eachother, especially Tripp and T'pol. The Resident science officer , to me, had the most story lines revolved around her next to the captain of course. T'pol was exploring her own emotions, relationships, job and love life throughout , talk about character growth! My favorite episodes, although all of them were amazing, were:

Impulse-I love me some zombies, and I loved me some Vulcan zombies even more! Trillium infected vulcans are downright frightening, and even worse was T'pol getting infected by it, although I loved seeing her flip out.

Exile- This was the most ""Buffy-like"" episode of star trek I have ever seen for some reason. Maybe it was the demon like telepath who got a hankering for Hoshi to become his consort till death, or maybe it was the whole crystal thing he used to magnify his powers, I still liked it though.

Twilight- Captain archer gets a spacial parasite thingee in his brain and his short term memory doesn't work, so we see the future where earth is gone and the xindi are hunting down leftover humans, and more importantly we see how loyal and loving T'pol really is towards Archer. I cried my eyes out in this one.

NorthStar- I have always always always hated ""Trek Westerns"" where on star trek they find some alien planet that has some random western motif going on, its always cheesy with its pink skyline and tumbleweeds. BUT this episode cured that hatred, it actually made sense! Aliens kidnapped humans for slaves, brought them to a planet, and the humans revolted, but never evolved technically or socially. Archer looked darn fine in that hat.

Similitude- Tripp gets hurt, and Phlox makes a clone of him called ""sim"" to transplant brain matter to tripp and save his life, Archer makes the decision to go ahead with the clone, and realizes that its not so easy to create a life that is sentient and than later have to kill it to save another life. We get to see, via ""sims"" memories from tripp, that he likes T'pol in a romantic way, and she is so sweet to give him that kiss, I seriously cried again.

Proving Ground- I am in love with the Andorians, Commander Shran is freaking brilliant, adorable, and one of the best aliens ever on star trek. He is both enemy and friend, and this is the episode that shows that dichotomy I love the ""we have come here to get some....archerite from this planet""

Doctors Orders- God, I love Phlox and a whole entire episode devoted to him? Heaven. The crew is in a stasis state and he must take care of them while they travel 4 days, he starts to hallucinate, get paranoid, and eventually has to save enterprise by himself!

There are too many to list, too many good ones. The spheres, the 5 xindi species, Degra, the constant interference from Daniels, the cliffhangers, its all just such amazing TV I cant understand any Trek fan, or sci fi nut who wouldn't love this, totally worth the bucks.",1178236800,12,3461,4.6237785016286646

At the end of the previous season, some race decides to wipe out 7 million Earthlings for no apparent reason, and the Enterprise crew spent this entire season trying to find them.  It was partially but not fully resolved by the end of season 3, and they left us on another cliffhanger at the end.  For anyone who thought the Xindi storyline was stupid, this one is even worse.  This season was bad enough that even a strong season 4 couldn't save the show.  In season 3, Star Trek became a 3rd rate soap opera.

A Star Trek about the first human starship to go out and explore space should have been along the lines of the first TV show, and the opening video reflects this by showing early explorers, but then the show is actually about them fighting multiple interdimensional time traveling aliens while being guided by humans from the distant future.  Oddly enough the first starship is able to stand toe to toe against aliens who have had space travel for hundreds if not thousands of years.  It is as if the writer wanted to write a different type of show, and forced it on this show.",1171670400,5,1115,4.485148514851486
2369236,5,B000A6CLL0,"Just finished Season 3 of Star Trek Enterprise and wow!!!!! This Star Trek series is not like the other Star Trek epics (from Captain Kirk onwards), and does not keep up with the series tradition of soft-core Sci-fi. This series has lots of people dying and lots of blood splattered around!!!! Casualties are high at an unprecedented level for any Star Trek show. And with a deviation from the previous Star trek tradition, lots of sexual suggestions; some indecent episodes, and tacky sexploitation of T'Pol (Jolene Blalock). Definitely not for children! For example, T'Pol taking showers; removing her clothes for bio-scans; massage sessions with Commander Tucker (Connor Trinneer) and her intense sexual urges. I think the producers are searching for a new audience. Even the good guys die! And the Vulcan T'Pol has weaknesses, unlike Spot.

Furthermore, each episode follows on the previous episode, sort of like Kiefer Sutherland's 24. This is unique in this series of Star Treks. Usually, each episode of the previous Star Trek sagas was independent of each other. One used to be able to watch any of the previous Star Trek episodes without being lost as to what is going on. With Season 3 of Enterprise, however, you'd have to pretty much start with episode one to really understand what is going on and enjoy the series (again, like 24 or Lost).

The whole season revolves around one story: how to stop the Xindi from destroying planet Earth! The Xindi, a race made up of 5 surviving species (Primates, Arboreals, Reptilians, Aquatics and Insectoids), aided by a species from a trans-dimensional space, have attacked Earth and killed seven million people. The attack came from the Delphic Expanse, an unstable region of space where our laws of physics are non-existent. The Enterprise's mission: enter the Expanse, find the Xindi, and prevent them from deploying the weapon that is being designed to destroy Earth. This storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you hunger for more.

Finally the producers figured it out (much to Manny Coto's credit)! They are starting to copy series like 24 and Lost!

Season 3 is really exciting and action packed; more so than any of the previous series from Kirk onwards. Note though that this intense action and having each episode follow on the previous one, starts only with Season 3. Season 1 and 2 were bland and much like their predecessors.

I highly recommend Season 3, and can't wait to watch Season 4.",1169596800,10,2470,4.927884615384615
2369237,5,B000A6CLL0,"Like the recent revival of the Ford Thunderbird, the Enterprise Season 3 DVD set is overpriced although the product within is beautiful. The video quality is fine, sound is rich, and the extras are good, but at least as much love and care were lavished on other series, like Freaks and Geeks, without the high price. (Through a series of fortunate events, I got my copy at a discount.)

I don't consider myself a big Star Trek fan. Most of the shows set in the Trek universe work so hard to be ""Star Trek"" that much of the life is gone from them. My immediate attraction to Enterprise came because it was a bit less formulaic than the other shows-- for example, ""comic relief"" is blissfully absent here. The goofy humor of Star Trek: The Next Generation never appealed to me. Fox Mulder's dry wise cracking on The X Files? Funny stuff! Commander Data trying to be Sherlock Holmes? Not so much.

Season 2 of this series found an unusually natural and convincing cast awash in a sea of weak dialog and worn-out stories. (Wow, there are aliens trying to destroy the Enterprise with a time bomb! Oh, it was only a dream.) Threatened with TV extinction, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman (who wrote many of season 2's episodes themselves) brought in several important new writers and loosened the reins on the aging Trek formula. All kinds of interesting ideas were unleashed and explored, characters gained dimension, and aspects of the difficult world we face here in the 21st century were reflected in  Enterprise's 22nd.

In season 3 we have a series that offers the excitement of the best space opera (wowie zowie phasers, stunts, and great production design) and the ideas of real speculative fiction (cloning, dimensional shifts, and temporal manipulation). Ruminations on loneliness, loss, and sexuality bring human drama to a genre that often settles for melodrama. (Curiously, religion is absent.) At the same time, Archer and his crew are dealing with the kind of stress and moral dilemmas that make the best episodes of ER so compelling. Few big-budget action movies pack as much interest and emotion as ""Star Trek: Enterprise-- the Complete Third Season.""",1168732800,4,2159,4.858695652173913
2369238,5,B000A6CLL0,"They say that stress is the true test of a person's character.  If that be the case, then the crew of the Enterprise acquired more than enough character during the third season, having had far more than their fair share of adversity.

The entire third season is a single arc, begun at the end of the second season and which closes at the beginning of the fourth.  A previously unknown race, the Xindi, have attacked Earth and killed seven million people.  The attack came from the Expanse, an unstable region of space that lets ships in but not out, and where even the laws of physics are sometimes suspended.  The Enterprise's mission: enter the Expanse, find the Xindi, and prevent them from deploying the weapon (the first was only a prototype) that is being designed to destroy Earth entirely.

But the Enterprise crew itself is not entirely united, nor completely fit.  Lt. Reed's security department has been supplemented by a contingent from the Military Assault Command (the MACOs), whose presence (and whose leader) Reed deeply resents.  Commander Tucker's hometown was destroyed in the attack, and he has recurring nightmares about his sister, who was killed.  Commander T'Pol is slowly losing her ability to contain her emotions, a grave (and offensive) affliction for any Vulcan.  And Captain Archer fights to retain his humanity as he is repeatedly forced to cross ethical boundaries (such as torture and piracy) in order to make the Enterprise's mission succeed.

Tucker's and T'Pol's personal struggles drive them together (they are an unlikely couple but most enjoyable to watch) and in their mutual support, they at least are able to cope.  Archer, on the other hand, cannot cope with the monster inside him that the Xindi attack has unleashed.  He has changed, as he himself admits in the fourth season, ""and not at all for the better.""

Although the Xindi arc, the longest in the history of Star Trek, is itself interesting to watch unfold, the third season is also interesting for the character development.  The main characters not only carry out their mission and are almost killed many times along the way, but they also grow as people, so that by the end they share a collective bond to each other that is as strong as those of Kirk's and Picard's Enterprises, and perhaps stronger.

This season, like all others in Star Trek, is not immune from the occasional ""not-so-great"" episodes and I prefer not dwell on them, as what makes an episode good or bad is in the eye of the beholder.  If I do find any great fault in the third season, it is that the producers did not full resolve the Xindi arc at the end of this season, but instead sent the Enterprise on a pointless Nazi-timewarp excursion instead (to be resolved at the beginning of the fourth season).  The viewer will eventually see the battered ship and crew arrive home to a victor's and savior's welcome, but that moment of triumph is unsatisfyingly postponed for another day.

All in all, however, a most enjoyable season.",1167177600,3,3007,4.815175097276264

2369240,5,B000A6CLL0,"Overall in my view this is the best season of Enterprise.  While the focus is basically on the 'Xindi Arc', overall the Xindi theme is well executed from start to finish with few flaws.  It is by far the darkest part of the series (much as the Dominion War arc was the darkest part in DS9) but the hardship and life and death situations the crew face lead to the most interesting exploration of the psyches of the main characters, their sometimes dubious actions and choices (such as Archer's torture of an alien to find out more about the Xindi and stealing a warp coil from a neutral ship after the Enterprise is attacked and crippled) in the face of extreme situations.

Other interesting aspects of the series are neglected, such as the development of the relationships between the various Star Trek races, though these are explored in some detail in the Fourth Season.

I think the end of this series was spoiled somewhat by the 'Nazi' Arc (overall this addition to the Xindi Arc to conclude the Temporal Cold War wasn't well written or executed, or that convincing) but generally, it was very well done and acted.",1163635200,,1119,4.636363636363637

This Season, alone, without the support of any of the other seasons, or any of the other series, for that matter. Is in my estimation the crowning achievment of the entire Star Trek Franchise. There are elements within the tale that draw from other episodes but thier impact on the story as a whole is minimal.

I won't encapsulate the season, it's been done. I will elucidate and provide a few observations on individual aspects of the season.

First I want to discuss the Xindi, a more realistic group of antagonists will be very difficult to find. They are well concieved, interesting and entirely believable. You'll find yourself liking most of them and understanding thier motives, however disagreeable they may be.

Second is the Enterprise crew, specifically Archer. How do people react to stress, the loss of loved ones, the weight of an entire planet resting on your shoulders. These are the questions answered by the actions of the crew of Enterprise, and it is all handled brilliantly from the writing to the acting. You can feel and empathize with every emotion that the crew experiences. The amazing part is you can do the same with most of the Xindi you meet along the way.

Third is Enterprise, I never thought I would feel so much affection for an imaginary ship other than the original NCC-1701. It reminds me of how I felt about the boats that I served aboard. I watched Voyager and the ""Year in Hell"" but the ship was a collection of pretty sets and nifty special effects. The original ship was a trusted companion, a guardian and a home. The NX-01 is all of these things and more and in season three her endurance is stretched to the limit, she is battered, beaten and injured along the way.

Finally, the ride. This season is an entire story arc and it is fantastic. I mentioned Babylon 5 in my previous review and I'll bring it up again here. Because, although B5 didn't invent the serial style of story, with a grand arc that spanned more than a couple of episodes, it did revolutionaize bring it to Sci-Fi with it. Enterprise distilled that into a single season, and you feel yourself racing along with it. As if your on a roller coaster, racing from one weightless drop to the next, grinding your teeth through the loops and catching your breath, for that brief instant in between. If you have ever watched 24 you have an inkling of what it's like, electrifying, intense, unnerving and inspiring all at the same time. And they have carried this effect over into the fourth season although on a smaller scale.

If you only want to try one season of Enterprise make it this one, it will not disappoint and besides, if you watch this one you'll want to see them all.",1153440000,2,2858,4.592156862745098
2369273,2,B000A6CLL0,"Season three of Enterprise is one of the primary reasons the show was cancelled.  Ratings dropped during this season and the announcement of the show's cancellation came before the superior season 4 could save it.

The problem with season three is that nearly every episode deals directly with the Xindi threat.  Long story arcs have happened in Star Trek before, such as the Dominion Wars in DS9.  The problem with the Xindi arc is that there are too few ""change of pace"" episodes.  Having three out of every four episodes about the same stroyline is boring.  There was not enough variety in this season.  It became quite redundant and I was quite happy when it ended.  Plus, there was no real suspense.  It was obvious that Earth was not going to be destroyed, so the outcome was not enough to keep one on the seat of his/her pants.

Season 4 was much better, but unfortunately couldn't save the show.  The idea of shorter story arcs was excellent, given the poor ratings they got in the previous season.  These mini-arcs were somewhat unique in the world of Star Trek, but worked much better than the mega-arc that was season 3.",1151452800,3,1131,4.628140703517588
2369274,5,B000A6CLL0,"Whatever reservations I may have had about this show were quickly dissipated with season 3, which gave us one of the best long-running sci-fi story arcs I've seen and almost easily the best in Star Trek history (edging out DS9's Final Chapter).  Probably season 3's greatest attribute is its relative consistency.  Sure, not every episode was great, but each had something to add to the lengthy plot, and it usually entertained in the process.  The end result was an ambitious season highlighted by enjoyable storytelling, excellent f/x, and plenty of tension and intrigue.

The Xindi- B.  A good start to the Xindi arc, with interesting conflicts aboard the ship and a damn good action sequence at the end of the episode.

Anomaly- B.  This episode further highlights the dangers of the Delphic Expanse in a convincing and entertaining fashion.

Extinction- B-.  Okay, I know this one's universally despised, but I was pretty amused by it through and through.

Rajiin- B-.  I was hoping to see more between the ultra-hot Hoshii and Rajiin, but the scene just cut away!  Otherwise, it's a enjoyable enough episode.

Impulse- A-.  Zombie Vulcans!  Though it doesn't particularly further the Xindi arc, this is still an exciting, action-packed episode.

Exile- B-.

The Shipment- B.  Adds an extra dimension to the already intriguing Xindi race.

Twilight- A.  Possibly the season's best episode, even if it does seem a bit inspired by TNG's Yesterday's Enterprise and 50 First Dates.  Still, it represents everything I love about Star Trek.

North Star- B.  Another unpopular episode, this time saved by a really cool shootout/fight scene at the end.

Similitude- C-.  Despite the moral complications, I found this a pretty dull Tucker episode.

Carpenter Street- C+.  Watchable, but it doesn't really succeed as a time travel piece or as an action episode either.

Chosen Realm- C+.  Pretty much a filler episode, though I did like the final scene.

Proving Ground- B.  Nice to see Shran again, especially in an episode that delivers its share of thrills and intriguing plot turns.

Stratagem- B+.  It's a lot of fun watching Archer and the crew try to manipulate Degra.

Harbinger- B.  A solid episode that furthers the story arc while also giving us an enjoyable fight scene between Reed and Major Hayes.

Doctor's Orders- B-.  The season's Dr. Phlox episode, and while I think it could have been even creepier, it still does a nice job building a sense of isolation.

Hatchery- B-.

Azati Prime- B.  Another good episode, though I would have liked a bit more expansion on that future Daniels was showing to Archer.

The Damange- B+.  Archer goes to some extreme lengths to continue his mission.  It's breaking these ehtical boundaries that make this a very compelling episode.

The Forgotten- B.  A decent episode as Archer tries to convince the Xindi they're being manipulated.

E squared- B-.  The premise is intriguing and most of the episode does entertain, but it doesn't end on the most satisfying note.

The Council- B+.  The pace reaches a feverish height as we approach the end of the arc.  There's plenty of dramatic conflict and a cool space battle towards the end.

Countdown- A.  Wow.  As a pure thrill ride, Countdown is one of the best Star Trek episodes ever, highlighted particularly by an awesome space battle worthy of the big screen.  Toss in some exciting phaser fights and the death of a major character and we've got one of my favorite Trek episodes, period.

Zero Hour- B.  After the frantic thrills of Countdown, things actually slow down a bit for the first half of Zero Hour, hurting the momentum somewhat.  Thankfully, the second half of the episode packs some exciting action and ends the Xindi arc on a strong note (rather reminiscent of Star Trek: Nemesis now that I think about it).  The plot twist at the end does seem pretty gratuitous, though.",1144886400,2,3881,4.901234567901234
2369275,5,B000A6CLL0,"I didn't see the entirety of this season during it's original airing so a lot of it made zero sense to me at the time.

After learning the multi species Xindi are building a weapon to destroy the planet it's on with this season. The subplot about the Xindi gives these episodes a great base on which to build rather then drowning the stories out-overall this stories presented this season are a lot more varied and interesting then the previous season. Everyone here has their own favorite episodes so I will name mine:
IMPULSE
  On a ship of mutated Vulcan zombies T'Pol is exposed to trilium which causes her to experiece intense emotional reactions-a great sense of drama.
EXTINCTION
  In a similar plotline to the TNG episode 'Identity Crisis' Archer,Hoshi and Reed are mutated into alien primates and it's found this is a dead races long lost method of repopulating itself. Some of the ""transformation"" FX sequences are eerily incredible!
NORTH STAR
  One of my favorites of the season-Archer and company go Western style when they discover a colony of 19'th Western-era Americans whose ancestors were kidnapped from Earth by aliens to work as labor. A great,fast paced tale about the prejiduce created by gross revisionist history.
SIMILTUDE
  This episode is a lot of people's favorite from this season. Trip dies and the only way to save him is an organ transplant from a close Phlox creates from a mimetic lifeform that starts out looking like a ball of tripe. But as the Trip clone realizes who he is he begins to have doubts about his reasons for life. Another one of those great ""tough choice"" episodes.
HATCHERY
  Captain Archer becomes an ""obsessed mother figure"" to a group of infact insect Xindi after he becomes obsessed with delivering the infants back to their people. One of Scott Bakula's best moments in this role!
E2
  There are suddenly two Enterprise's when an alternate timeline is created where NX-01 is forced into becomming a multi generational vessell.

  One thing about this season is it's NOT  for the time travel phobic-this season is chock full of episodes involving time travel to the past,future (including the return of Daniels and a cameo from the 26'th century Enterprise J) and every kind of alternate reality you can think of. One interesting plot twist is the awkward interpersonal relationship between the suddenly heavily emotional T'Pol and Trip. Not to mention that,even the episodes featuring the multi species Xindi keep a non-stop progression;this season has none of the dead,boring moments the previous one did. It's really a pity Enterprise never was able to continue beyond the next season because this could have been a new beginning for this series rather then the near end it turned out to be.",1143504000,6,3280,5.24282982791587
2369276,5,B000A6CLL0,"ENTERPRISE seems to invoke either high praise or harsh critique. I really like ENT and have trouble understanding why its own fans destroyed this fantastic series.

The 3. Season ranks as one of the best, along with Season 4. And no doubt would have gotten better if only been given a fair chance.

It has a suspense ongoing storyline, strong characters and a purpose. The last 7 episodes starting with AZATI PRIME and finally culminating in ZERO HOUR keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time and makes you hunger for more.

For me ENT is clearly the highest ranking series in the franchise, along with VOY and DS9. The highly praised TNG was boring me to tears most of the time. Don't get me wrong I like Picard and his crew, but if I had to choose I would pick ENT everytime. I can watched any ENT episode over and over before I start TNG again.

The DVD set itself is what you come to expect from Paramount. The case is more beautiful than any of the other series and I have them all. And with ENT we finally get to see some bloopers, although they become shorter as the series comes to an end.

2369278,4,B000A6CLL0,"Some critics complained that the season long Xindi story arc was too long, I thought it often had some good bits to it.

I thought the production values were good and many of the story line bits were good as well. T'Pol sports a new hairstyle and costumes, Reed actually had a force field,(in one episode), several of the stories were good.

#8 Twilight was interesting, set 12 years in the future Enterprise had failed in it's mission when Archer was disabled and T'Pol took over but due to a just in time cure developed by Phlox Archer is cured (both in the future and in the ""present"") and save the day.

#9 North Star was about a colony of 19th century humans captured and taken to the quadrant as slaves. When Enterprise arrived they'd long since revolted and in turn enslaved their captors. The story was fun, one of the better ones of the season, but it had some plot holes big enough to fly Enterprse through. The original human population couldn't have been very large but somehow they've expanded to 5,000 or so in 300 years and maintained a civilization like their ancestors had (realistically they couldn't have enough genetic variety to remain healthy and wouldn't have had all the skills needed to keep up their society. The Skagaarans would've been even worse off).

#11 Carpenter Street Daniels sends Archer and T'Pol back to Detroit in 2004 to stop some Reptilian Xindi from producing a doomsday bioweapon. I liked this episode as well as any.

#14 Stratagem involved Enterprise somehow capturing Xindi Leader Degra and while he's unconscious constructing a ship set on board Enterprise. He woke up in the set and was supposed to be fooled into thinking that he and Archer were escaped prisoners, the idea being that he'd be tricked into revealing the location of the weapon. Not a very likely plot.

#16 Doctor's orders was interesting, the crew couldn't safely cross some region of space so Phlox had to put them all to sleep and fly the ship himself, several surprises in that episode.

The last few episodes all work pretty well with most of the Xindi races becoming allies with Enterprise, lots of action towards the last and a surprising twist finale leading up to the fourth and final season.

I don't remember the extras all that well now but the Day in the life of a director with Roxann Dawson was actually better than the second season one with Levar Burton. She directed at least one episode, #6 Exile, and took the camera all around the set on a tour, seemed very friendly and told a lot of details.",1135900800,,2529,4.642058165548098

I own every movie and television show on dvd, and I realize that it is a big no no, but of all movies, shows, etc... this season is the best of all. The ongoing story arc is brilliant, yet the individual shows plots and character developments are never forced and add to the tension of the final showdown. If this season had been viewed by all the fans who gave up after seasons 1 or 2 the show would never have been cancelled. Fantastic job by cast and crew. Great forsight by the writers to plan and execute to perfection a 24 episode thriller.",1135468800,,593,4.165217391304348
2369280,4,B000A6CLL0,"Season three is mostly dominated by the xiandi threat to earth. As time goes on it's is made clearer that the xiandi believe the earth is a threat to because a species from trans dimensional space that helped the xiandi out after they almost nearly destroyed themselves is saying the earthlings are a threat to them because in the future the xiandi, starfleet, and others will become allied to stop the trans dimensional space beings because the orbs they have deployed are actually transfoming regions of space into their dominion and making it unihabitable for regular beings to live in that space. The guy from starfllet in the future makes clear to John Archer that he must somehow convince the xiandi to see that this is the case. It isn't an easy task for Archer to so especially with the xiandi reptilians and insects ceatures. It goes into the fourth season with the xiandi problem still unsolved.",1133481600,,905,4.770700636942675
2369281,4,B000A6CLL0,"Of the four Star Trek seasons, this is far and away the darkest of the four, featuring a 9/11 theme.  Earth suffers a devastating attack from an alien species, and Enterprise is dispatched to eliminate the threat.  In this season we see a darker, more ruthless Captain Archer, who is determined to carry out his mission, occasionally bending, or even breaking, his usual high ethical standards.

This season is pretty good, and most of the episodes are excellent entertainment.  The cast continues to develop excepting Hoshi and Mayweather, who for some reason seem to recede in this season.  The MACOs are a valuable addition to the cast, and frankly it now seems odd that a Starship would travel on missions without a group that is skilled at tactical operations on the ground.

Unfortunately, it is my theory that this season is perhaps the cause of the Enterprise series' demise.  Most Star Trek episodes stand on their own, and the viewer needs only a minimal familiarity with the series, or even none at all, in order to enjoy a given episode.  Not so Season Three.  This is essentially a miniseries about Enterprise's struggle against the Xindi (the alien race that attacked Earth, and which Enterprise seeks to de-fang).  The various episodes are highly interconnected and require quite a bit of familiarity with the series in order to make sense.  Despite being pretty darned good entertainment, I believe that this inhibited the ability of the series to attract new viewers, or even retain some viewers who for whatever reason could only catch some but not all episodes.  Usually a series like Enterprise hits its stride around Season Three, and perhaps really begins to attract viewers.  That is not what happened here, and I speculate (with minimal data, admittedly) that the complexity of the Season Three theme hurt the ability of the series to attract viewers.

The other thing I dislike about Season Three is the heavy time-travel theme.  I believe that the best Star Trek episodes are those that stick with its core theme: what will mankind find when it ventures out among the stars, and what will these discoveries do to and for mankind?  Interstellar travel makes unlmited theme variations possible.  There is no need for time travel, which is improbable of achievement, in contrast with space travel, which is probably humanity's ultimate destiny.

It is unfortunate that Enterprise did not stay around longer, because in my opinion Enterprise is far and away the best of the Star Trek series (and I love them all!).  Enterprise really captures the notion of humankind just beginning to explore the nearby regions of the Galaxy, encountering new intelligent species for the first time, including species such as the Andorians and the Vulcans who are more technologically advanced than humans.  Enterprise has a fresh, ""New Frontier"" feeling to it that the best episodes of The Original Series also had. (See ""The Menagerie"" episode if you want an example of this).

Nothing in this review is meant to minimize the entertainment value of Season Three.  This is wonderful entertainment from which anyone who likes science fiction and/or Star Trek will derive great enjoyment.  I give it four stars rather than five simply to contrast it with the superb Season Four.  Season Four is the season in which the series really hit its stride, showing the tremendous possibilities Enterprise made possible.",1132790400,3,3416,5.01595744680851

2369323,5,B000A6CLL0,"The 3rd season, which at this point is now known as ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" and also the remix of ""Where my heart will take me"" from a Gospel like song to a more upbeat rock version of the show. But anyway, I think the best episodes on this sete were, The Xindi ""because they were the ones that started it with the attack on earth"", another episode would be ""North Star"", in which an old western ""Skag"" Outsider was hung just because he was a skag. The other episode that caught my eye was called ""e2"" in which 150 yrs back, the same Enterprise crew was founded by the same crew as the current Enterprise! But all in all, season 3 is one of my favorite episodes in which will lead towards the season 4 multi-story-arc finale.",1130803200,,725,4.299270072992701
2369324,3,B000A6CLL0,"Braga and Berman wrecked the series in Season 1 by introducing the ""temporial war"" and rewriting the history of Star Trek essentially because they could.  They wrote ridiculously PC stories and dumbed down the characters to the point they were little more than wooden robots coached from offscreen.  They had this fascination with caves that bordered on the unreal (look up the filksong ""Caves of the Heart"").  They freely stole stories from other ST series and made hashes of them.

Having said that, Season Three bordered on the passable.  If they had STARTED with this season, Enterprise would still be in production and most likely a hit today.  It did nothing but improve as the season went along and provided a few moments of gripping action with some fresh ideas thrown in along the way.  Much of this was because B&B brought on Manny Coto who had a much better feel for the show than them and could actually write his way out of a paper sack when the Muse was with him.  But by then it was too late:  Too many ""hard core"" ST fans had been lost and there was no great attraction to draw in new fans and the show sputtered and died.

If they ever decide to ""reimagine"" Enterprise let me make a few suggestions:

- No time travel.  It's been so badly overused in the ST franchise that if any plot device deserves retirement, it's this.

- Follow WC Fields' advice:  ""Never work with dogs or kids.""  Porthos was cute exactly once and added nothing to the story.  If you have to have an animal aboard ship make it a cat or a monkey:  they can act.

- NO VULCANS.  There is no ""law"" of Star Trek that every ship MUST have a Vulcan Science Officer.  Joleen Blalock looks just as good in a skin-suit WITHOUT the pointy ears as with them.  T'Pol added nothing to the series except the constant reminder that Humans are ignorant savages with no social skills and no understanding of Galactic Society.  This is a story about mankind reaching out to the universe; they don't need a schoolmarm along to scold them for being uncouth.

- For that matter, don't name the ship (or series) ""Enterprise"".  As startling as this sounds, this invites direct comparisons to the other ships and casts in the Star Trek franchise and this is terribly divisive to the audience.  The best of the ""modern"" ST series was DS-9 and the USS Enterprise barely showed up there at all.  You don't need a ""5-year mission"", either.  JUST A GOOD STORY.  Heck, they could have hitched a ride on an Andorian freighter to the Expanse and used a shuttle to get around once there:  The NX-01 was almost useless and a constant distraction.  If they have a ship give it a lower profile: make it a plot device to get from point A to point B and don't make such a big deal over it being ""the first Warp 5 capable starship"".  NO ONE CARES.  It will never be as good as the NCC-1701, A, B, C, D, or E versions because it's from 100 years in the past.",1129680000,4,2908,4.407894736842105
2369325,4,B000A6CLL0,"I didn't watch much Enterprise when it was on, unfortunately. Scheduling conflicts prevented me from fully enjoying the series, even though I did manage to catch the occasional episode. It's a great benefit to people like me, then, that the entire run is now on DVD.

The full season DVD set is especially useful for this third season, because the entire season is essentially one extended episode. The Xindi Saga.

It's interesting to watch as Archer and the crew (and the fledgling Starfleet, for that matter) respond to a terrorist attack on the planet Earth. All of the emotions that we felt after 9/11 are present in this season -- as are the decisions that we've had to make (for good or ill). We see the conflict among the Xindi, and then we watch the various factions in Iraq battle for control. The parallels are interesting to watch, and are very much in tune with the tone set by Roddenberry in the original Star Trek.

Equally interesting are the scenes involving the Xindi council. We see a people who are not (all) warlike and violent, but who are intent on saving their homeworld from destruction by the human ""threat"" 400 years in the future. Bad guys who aren't (all) quite so bad is part of the Star Trek experience -- even Klingons are now seen as a race governed by a sense of honor that humans cannot quite equal.

In the middle of this political commentary, a little social commentary is thrown in for good measure. In ""Similitude,"" Tripp is seriously injured. Flox creates a clone, to attempt to help save Tripp's life. But the clone has other ideas about life, and whose should be saved. The episode gives a whole new perspective on the issue of cloning.

Season three of Enterprise shows a lot of the promise that the series had. I grew tired quickly of the ""Enterprise as backstory"" idea that seems to plague much of the series, and I enjoyed seeing an alien race that we don't ever see again in any Star Trek incarnation. Enterprise was at its strongest when it was allowed to function as its own series, rather than being so dependant on the rest of the Star Trek franchise.",1129680000,3,2102,4.579787234042553
2369326,5,B000A6CLL0,"Having never watched Enterprise before I started buying the DVDS, because I don't have UPN, I am only now watching these episode for the first time. I have to say that Enterprise Season Three is the best out of the three seasons released so far.

It really has matured into Star Trek. There is action mixed with thoughtful plots. There is a revenge story the entire season and the pain of the crew's loss can be felt on almost every episode.

The entire storyline is based on the tragic event of 9/11. Earth is minding it's own business and is attacked, killing seven million people on Earth. The storyline is so close to what happened in real life, you'll be on edge hoping Earth gets revenge for the slaughter of seven million innocent people.

The Xindi themselves are an interesting new species of aliens that have never before been seen, but arguably have been mentioned in Trek before ENT. They make the Suliban seem weak.

Overall, Enterprise Season 3 is the season to get if you are a fan of Trek or ENT alone, even non-fans would enjoy this. I've been a fan of Trek for years and I have to say that Season 3 is a must own even for those who didn't like the previous two seasons. This has to be in the top 5 seasons of all time for any Trek series. Get it, and you won't be disappointed",1129075200,3,1294,4.3347107438016526
2369327,4,B000A6CLL0,"The third season of ""Enterprise"" had its challenges: the ratings were sagging and the producers were hoping to increase viewership; facing strong critical reaction from fans the series became much more action based with stronger stories that separated it from ""Voyager"" and put it more in the leage of ""Deep Space Nine"" (still the finest ""Trek"" series IMO). If you like ""Enterprise"" this is probably the seasont that truly got you hooked. With the season long story arc of the Xindi, Enterprise went into uncharted territory for the series. The Xindi are a race that have designed a weapon to kill everyone on Earth. They've discovered that humanity will, in the future, destroy their planet so they've elected to strike before that event occurs. Captain Archer (Scott Bakula) and his crew have this information revealed by a time traveler involved in the Temporal Cold War from season one for his own nefarious reasons. By the way there is a podcast for one of the best episodes during the third season ""Twilight"" available at the offical ""Star Trek"" website with writer Michael Sussman and moderator Tom Gaskill. Why this wasn't included on the boxed set, I don't know but it's an excellent podcast. This one unlike the others was designed for the DVD boxed set for the third season.

Enterprise goes into the uncharted Delphic Expanse where the laws of physics are sometimes altered by the anomolies encountered in the region and the mysterious metallic spheres located throughout the region. Enterprise is on a desperate mission to discover the Xindi homeworld in hopes of stopping the weapon (which has already been tested on Florida leaving 7 million dead at the end of season two)or convincing the Xindi that Earth is not a threat. Bakula came into his own this season playing a decision battle hardened Archer. The optical effects and sets are impressive as are the different alien species some of which are portrayed via CGI.

Although it wasn't a perfect series, ""Enterprise"" offered much hope for the franchise during the third and fourth season (before the disasterous and horrible final episode of season four). As usual the image quality on this series is top notch and Paramount keeps getting better with the extras. I did, however, have to go back and return three separate sets before I got a complete set that wasn't defective which was extremely frustrating.

The extras this time around include a discussion as to why producers Braga and Berman brought on Manny Coto (the talented writer/producer/creator of ""Odyssey Five"")as a writer/producer. There's also a discussion as to the reasons for the season long Xindi story arc introduced at the end of season two. There's a very good featurette on directing the show featuring Roxann Dawson, outtakes, deleted scenes, a couple of commentary tracks by Manny Coto and Assistant director Mike De Merritt on shooting the episode ""North Star"". Also we get text commentary on three episodes ""Impulse"", ""Count Down"" and ""Xindi"" by Michael and Denise Okuda. There's also a profile of Connor Trinner aka ""Trip"". Trinner honestly assesses the changes in the character he started to make as the series progressed (for the good). There's also a photo gallery, episode synposis booklet and Easter eggs.

While this was a shorter seson (24 vs. 26), the third season was a huge improvement over the first two and made for compelling action driven science fiction. While there were a few missteps (""Doctor's Orders"" which basically was a rewrite of a ""Voyager"" episode) most of the season was very strong with some of the best written episodes seen since ""Deep Space Nine"".

Complaints? The price is still way too high although the design for the packaging is unique and nice (that's what you're paying for along with the extensive extras). Also, ""Enterprise"" should have been given another year to see what Coto and Alan Brennart (""The Twilight Zone"") could have done as they did excellent work during season four as well. Now that ""Star Trek"" seems retired (for the moment) it does allow the oppportunity to reinvent the franchise and give it renewed energy.

Ratings was real low so they had to do something enter The Xindi. Season 3 is all about Enterprise going after The Xindi to stop there plans of wipeing out Earth for good. I loved how season 3 ended. Season 4 was also alot of fun. It's to bad the show got cancel. But at least we can enjoy this short lived show on DVD.It's nice to know after season 4 is released that the whole saga of Star Trek is on DVD-The Orginal series,TNG,DS9,Voyager,and Enterprise,plus the 10 movies,WOW thats alot of Trek to own! All we need now on DVD is The Cartoon series,and Hopefully that will be out soon?",1127865600,,733,4.318840579710145
2369330,5,B000A6CLL0,"Before reading this review, be aware that I am not only fanatical about sci-fi, I am also extremelly devoted to the world of star trek and have enjoyed all the different shows its spun off into.

  I have also been a great fan of enterprise, I believe they put together a great crew for the show, characters that are not only great actors, but work really well with each other, and within their roles.

  Having followed the first two seasons with mild fervor, i felt that towards the end of the second season, i came off wishing for somenthing more, episodes, though original in their stories, most memorably the season 2 episode ""Cogenitor"" comes to mind as a great moment in the series, I left myself yearning for somenthing more,where the story was going, it never felt that the stakes were high enough, within the world of enterprise. All that changed with the last episode of season 2, launching season 3 into a crusade like story that would begin a DEEP SPACE NINE: Dominion war style story.

  Cue season 3 of enterprise, and in my opinion the best thing to happen to sci-fi in recent times, the story of the Xindi, and their war of extermination on planet earth engulfed the entire 24 episodes of the thirds season, while the presence of the xindi objective is milder in some episodes, and critical in others, the pacing of interlinking all the eps, to tell a major story worked so well for me that I found myself stuck to the tv, and working my schedule around every week to wath the next episodes. In the days of television series that don't like to risk doing anything else apart from one stand alone episodes, season 3 of enterprise homages the pacing of SCI-FI legend BABYLON 5, and in doing so, tells a much more thorough and epic story, a SAGA if you will

  I was first in line to buy this dvd set, the great extras go a long way too, but I cant wait to sit and watch all the episodes again, as back to back as possible. I recomend this season vey highly for any fan of sci-fi.",1127779200,,1994,4.4032697547683926
2369331,3,B000A6CLL0,"In the interest of helping the sagging ratings, the producers decided to give the show a season long story arc.  Introduced in the second season finale, the crew of Enterprise has a new mission.  Instead of exploring, the crew must now track down the Xindi and stop them from building a weapon that will destroy Earth.  The problem is, the area of space they are exploring is filled with strange anomalies that affect the crew in strange ways.  And if they don't stop the Xindi, the entire human population will be destroyed.

With so much at stake, I was hoping this season would raise the series above the disappointing second season.  There were some very good episodes, but too many of them were still sub par.  In fact, many I had figured out completely by the second commercial break.  I was so bored it took my friends watching it with me to keep me going until the final episodes kicked the story into high gear and got me hooked again.

Die-hard Trekkies will want this set to complete their collection.  Casual fans can just pass right on by and wait for the far superior final season.",1127692800,3,1095,4.540816326530612
2369362,3,B000A6CLL0,"This was the season where I lost interest. I loved the first two seasons, but don't want to have to keep up with everything because each episode is really just a continuation of the last episode. Weren't the first two seasons a hit? Almost completely stand alone episodes. They ruined the show because after each episode I felt like it's not over. How do you watch one of these episodes when you know you are left hanging.  After season two ended with the attack on Earth, I figured next season would be two or three episodes to deal with the enemy and move on to regular stories. That's what they should have done. There was nothing wrong with the show but then season four is comprised of mostly two, three or four part episodes. The original Star Trek and the Next Generation were mostly stand alone shows, but I never really liked Next Generation, too politically correct for me.",1127606400,2,883,4.553459119496855
2369363,1,B000A6CLL0,"I loved seasons 1 & 2 - couldn't wait for season 3 to see the continuation of humanity's progress into space, evolution of our technology, etc.

Disappointment is not a strong enough word.

Least importantly ""they"" have messed with the theme tune (for ratings?). It's got the Quantum Leap beat now and doesn't pick up at the chorus anymore - the cool guitar bit behind ""no-one's gonna bend or break me"" is gone too :-( .

The entire season feels like a cross between the worst bits of Voyager and the dreary slow drawn out end to DS9 where ONE single predictable plot gets spread out over pretty much a whole season (like not enough butter over too much bread ;-) ).

You can tell where these plots are going (or rather, HAVE to go) and ""the clock's ticking for the whole season"" which kills off any chance for variation in story types and introduction of new ideas because the crew would be negligent to stay in any one place for longer than they had to.

I can go to work to feel that kind of pressure, thanks.

In my opinion it takes until the end of the second disk before there's a good episode.  Also there are a few less episodes than previously.

I wish I had not bought this.

2369364,5,B000A6CLL0,"One of the best seasons of ANY Star Trek series. Outstanding performances of the entire cast, great storyline and production quality that surpass the last 4 Star Trek Movies. Do you want to understand why Enterprise is one of the best Star Trek series, after TOS and TNG? Buy this Season!",1127001600,3,288,4.666666666666667
2369365,5,B000A6CLL0,"I don't think this is the best of all the Trek seasons--that honor goes to DS9 season 4--but ENT season 3 is in the top five.  There is a season-long story arc, but many of the shows can stand alone and are of excellent quality.  Enterprise is visually the best of all the Trek shows, and season three is the best-looking of all the Enterprise seasons.  The writers and producers do a great job of developing Archer's character, so the decisions he makes are sometimes noble, sometimes criminal, but always human.  This is terrific television and the high point of an unfortunately short-lived show.",1126310400,4,599,4.730769230769231
2369366,3,B000A6CLL0,"I applaud ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" for trying something bigger for its third season, but the results aren't terribly impressive.  The year-long storyline of the Enterprise searching out the mysterious Xindi and exploring the deadly ""Expanse"" region of the galaxy was good stuff, but there are a number of times where it simply doesn't go far enough, or where an episode nearly derails the entire thing.  It comes just to the edge of being quite good, but ultimately falls to the ""OK"" side of the fence.

The show is still plagued by many of the same problems it suffered from before, most noticeably that much of the cast is simply ignored.  Instead of developing current cast members, new ones are introduced this season, only to be dropped or forgotten two episodes later.  The show continually takes two steps forward, and then quickly takes one back.

That said, there is some wonderful visceral entertainment in this season.  The writers and directors got a bit more bold, with larger, more impressive action sequences, and the special effects in this third season are second to none.  The final stretch of episodes (save the ludicrous and awful season finale) are quite thrilling.  If only the show had had the balls not to screw up the ending, this would easily be a Four-star season.

Even with the several large problems this season suffers from, the third season of ""Star Trek: Enterprise"" (along with the fourth season) is the best season of ""Star Trek"" since the late 1990s.  That doesn't say much - it's still not nearly as good as it could or even should have been.  But it's worth checking out.",1124668800,9,1608,4.807272727272728
2369367,4,B000A6CLL0,"Finally!  Season three of Enterprise is actually something resembling a good show, unlike the pathetic seasons before.  This season has a great share of action.  More shootouts and ship-to-ship fighting.  Captain Archer has changed from his pukey, preachy former self into a fierce captain willing to do anything to protect earth.

  The story is great.  Starship Enterprise must enter the expanse, a very unstable region of space, to find and destroy the Xindi weapon.  There are some subplots (a few good, a few bad,) but the story focuses on the search for the weapon.  The story has many interesting aspects such as the creators of the weird spheres that litter the expanse.  A fantasic finale was cooked up by the writers that is sure to surprise many.

  I will list the positive and negative points of this season:

  +More action

  +A much more complex storyline

  +Captain Archer is now a great character

  +Less gag moments

  +One of the best finales of any show

  -Some pretty awful episodes (example: the crew find a planet set up as the wild west)

  -The stupid relationship between Science Officer Ta`pol and Chief Engineer Trip is expanded on and on

  -Some indecent episodes

  Season three of Enterprise is what the previous seasons should have been: a centralized storyline, a great captain, and lots of action.  I recommend skipping the first two seasons and move to this season instead.",1123113600,,1413,4.888412017167382
2369368,2,B000A6CLL0,"Series star Jolene Blalock  -who identified herself as a lifelong Star Trek fan - has said that the failure of this series was because ""The stories lacked intriguing content. They were boring."" She felt that the early scripts violated facts already established in other franchise shows and complained that the show substituted revealing costumes for character development. ""The audience isn't stupid,""  she protested. For year three, Brannon Braga and Rick Berman decided that they would finally address some of the fan complaints that the series lacked any sort of continuity and launched a season long arc about Earth threatened by a mysterious race called the Xindi -who were, for all intents and purposes, organized much like DS9's Dominion. Through the next 26 episodes (which then would be cut to 24 due to faltering ratings), Archer and his crew would search the galaxy for the Xindi in hopes of preventing them from destroying Earth. While ambitious in a year before the return of serialized drama, the series quickly fell into the same pattern as the previous two seasons: poorly written stories that said nothing, acting that made most soap stars look like Oscar winners, and an almost F You! to fans of TOS, TNG and DS9.  The show was not grabbing people viscerally, as freakier aliens, lapses in logical story telling, and lack of character growth were taking over. No one, including me, felt a need to rush home and see this show, because it was saying nothing. There was a message there, I'm sure, but it was buried under technobabble and increasing desire to hurt women. I'm often remember Trek motion pictures 1,2,3,4 and 6 because the story had revelance to today. Enterprise missed that boat, even though the Xindi arc was a mushy allegory about 9/11. Archer's moral compass was thrown, but ultimatley, he never any long reaching effects. Some will say a good leader has no doubts, but Star Trek tried to show you through the years that long after an unpopular action, the capatin still might feel pangs of regret. But not Jonthan Archer. He was tough as nails guy. Pfft, I say, as he became a tool of a jingonistic Rick Berman. Still, one thing that came from this season was Manny Coto. He tried to return a sense of balance, but because UPN were more concerned with who was watching Trek instead of paying attention to who wasn't, this series was doomed. And while a letter campaign was started to save the show, in the end, it was not that would give this series one more season. UPN was going to cancel the show after season three, and then Paramount -home of the Godfather franchise -made UPN a deal they could not resist. Cutting the $1.5 million fee UPN paid Paramount to air the show to $875,000 made UPN reconsider airing the show. It would return for 22 more shows, but from that moment on, no matter how much Coto improved the show, Enterprise was doomed. The 10.5 millions fans had dwindled down to 2.5. And the logic that escaped the story telling for so many years, pointed out that if no one is watching, why air it?",1123027200,16,3050,4.718574108818011
2369369,5,B000A6CLL0,"One of the best seasons of ANY Star Trek series.  It's an amazing and fun comeback that gets better as it goes.  Season 3 contains some of the better elements of the Deep Space 9 arcs and rectifies some problems with Voyager (like the ship never showing damage).  The minor character casting and chemistry problems were less noticeable in Season 3.  The Xindi arc was exciting and original (5 species forming one race) and the effects were exceptional.  The acting was excellent and alive, thanks in no small part to a great supporting cast.  If this had been season 1 of Enterprise, the show would still be on.  You'll be thrilled and amazed with this set. It's well worth the price!

PROS:

great supporting cast
Sphere Builders and Xindi = great, classic aliens
brilliant effects
excellent writing, good emotional scenes
Trip is a character instead of the village idiot
the ship takes on serious damage

CONS:

some episodes feel like filler
virtually every alien species is hostile
tacky sexploitation of Jolene Blalock
worst theme song in history
writing falls back on cheap tricks like erasing memory and time travel
the Xindi weapon looks like the Death Star",1122940800,10,1165,4.862944162436548
2369370,5,B000A6CLL0,"When Season 3 of Enterprise began, I was extremely anxious to see these new villains, the Xindi. Finding out that there were 5 species of Xindi floored me, but I was amazed by the CGI work for the Xindi-Insectoids and Xindi-Aquatics, as well as the makeup design for the Reptilians and Arboreals, though the Primates weren't too different from us. But then, aren't humans a higher form of primate?

Enterprise also went in a slightly new direction by introducing the MACOs, as well as T'Pol resigning her commission with the Vulcan High Command, and getting a new look.

The first first few episodes of the season were a little slow at times for my taste, but then the action picked up and the third season experienced a type of action-adventure not seen since Deep Space Nine's Dominion War, culminating in a 3-episode battle to the season's finale, which opened up another amazing storyline into the 4th season, which was unfortunately, the last.

I'm not going to provide a summary of each episode, as other reviewers have done this already.

However, it saddens me to note that Star Trek has ended (aside from the fan-mader series), due to a lack of interest. It disheartens me to think that people have come to like those garbage reality shows like 'Survivor' and 'Real Gilligan's Island', not to mention all of the even trashier titles in that genre.  What has happened to us that we are superhypercritical of every episode of a show, when we used to be able to just sit back with a bowl of popcorn and get swept away in the story, and ENJOY it?

Send a message to Hollywood. Stock up on DVDs of GOOD shows, and boycott these awful reality shows.

2369371,4,B000A6CLL0,"i have read what many have written about the death of ""enterprise"" however i think they miss the mark, but by just a little. what doomed ""enterprise"" was not the acting, or directing, or writing of any one episode. in fact i think one can make the valid point that the overall acting and directing, and the writting of many episodes in all 4 seasons was as good as anything in the trek canon.

  what undermined the show fron the beginning was the ""bible""

on which the show was based. i do not mean that a show that covered the beginning of the federation was a bad idea, just that the way it was done was totally screwed up fron the beginning. the basic idea the relationship between vulcans and

humans is more like that between overbaring parents and teenagers who thing they are allready adults. according the the ""bible"" the vulcans have spent the 88 years from ""first contact"" to the building of the nx-01 impeadind whenever possible, the ability of humans to get beyond the sol system.

humans have been denied such things as warp technology, information on the verious political relationships beyond the sol system ( such as relations between vulcan & andor, the very fact that there is a klingon empire - let alone it's size and power, ect, ect, ect...)and even such simple things as a up to date star chart, as well as being limited to what other races humans do come into contact with. because of this commercially operated space freighters have more experience, and their pilots have more flying time than mid 22nd century starfleet.

  because of all of this the first 2 seasons of ""enterprise""

bumbled, fumbled, and stumbled around the galaxy trying to explore without knowing the rules, while at the same time trying to avoid screwing up so badly as to warrent being called home and proving the vulcan high command correct. and having a first officer throught to have been placed on board to spy on the crew grew boring after a while. in addition the temoral cold war sub plot was never understandable, because you never did learn who was fighting who and why.

  by the time season two was coming down to its last few episodes, the show had crashed and burned, 75% of the viewership was gone (forever as it turned out) and the network, upn had switched the demographics, it wanted to go after ( let's face it, the type of viewer who would tune in week after week to find out at the end of the season which contestent will end up with the chance to be the next trya banks, most likely does not watch good drama on t.v., let alone good scifi, let alone star trek ) but after realizing their screw up, rick berman & co. decided the the ""bible"" was a failure and that if the show was going to be saved, some changed needed right away.

  season three was that change, and by the end of the season the show was finally on track, but running out of time. the idea of a season long story arc was a gamble, which in my opinion worked quite well. the only error in the story arc that i see was the maintaining the temoral cold war sub plot. this season laid the basis for season 4, which forfilled all the

hopes of the loyal viewers.

  as for the future, i fear that the release of ""enterprise""

will be the last new trek we will on either the small or big screen for a long time. paramount, as part of viacom, is going through some major changes at this time. and by the time things settle out, the new management may buy into the ""conventional wisdom"" that star trek has shot it's wad, that the star trek fan base are nothing but a bunch of over the hill nerds and geeks, and the path laid down by gene roddenberry is as out of date as the hayes code, god/gods/the phophets/the great bird of the galaxy help us all",1121558400,7,3727,4.395924308588064
