2815166,5,B000PC1PAW,"I remember these wonderful cartoons from every Thursday evening at 6:30 pm. in the early 60s, on our local channel, WGN. (that is when Quick Draw McGraw was`nt on). I just got the Droopy set, and now in 2 mos. this one too!! WOW! Now, not to detract from ol` Woody but I wish a Heckle and Jeckle set could be out as well.",1180483200,,321,4.03125
2815167,5,B000PC1PAW,"Great cartoon, I would watch Woody as a kid and laugh my a@% off. Classic material, Im glad its on the way!",1179878400,,107,3.909090909090909
2815168,5,B000PC1PAW,"Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Collection dvd set is a must-see, must-own dvd set for every classic cartoon fans. Think about it, You have Woody Woodpecker cartoon with chronological order and some of the finest  Walter Lantz studio classics in your hand. This is amazing collection.

Woody Woodpecker is one of animation histories most popular characters. He is manic, funny, violent one of a character. And, who could ever forget that hysterical laughter! If Bugs Bunny said ""Ah, What's up, Doc"" then Woody Woodpecker don't need words, he just goes crazy mode and laughs! Hysterically funny. Early Woody Woodpecker is especially my personal favorites.

First official Woody Woodpecker cartoon is Knock Knock. Actually it's Andy Panda cartoon, but everybody remembers Knock Knock as Woody Woodpecker's incredible debut cartoon. And he stole every second of it from poor Andy Panda and his father. Several years later Woody Woodpecker cartoon called Barber of Seville appeared, and many fans regarded this as best Woody Woodpecker cartoon of all time. Personally, it's not my favorite Woody Woodpecker cartoon, my candidate for best Woody Woodpecker cartoon is Hot Noon. But, I agree Barber of Seville is one great cartoon. I believe every classic cartoon fans had his or her own favorite Woody Woodpecker cartoon. So, buy this set, and judge for yourselves.

This collection not only have many classic Woody Woodpecker cartoons with chronological order, but other memorable Walter Lantz studio's classics also including this set. Some of them never released any kind of format in home video market before! My personal favorite is short called Musical Moments from Chopin. This Oscar-nominated cartoon is musical themed cartoon, and one of the funniest. Woody Woodpecker and Andy Panda teamed up for piano concert but so many weird things happened, and finally all hell breaks loose! Really amazing cartoon, don't miss it.

This year is really amazing year for classic cartoon fans. Woody Woodpecker and Friends classic collection, Popeye Collection vol. 1, and later this year Looney Tunes Golden Collection vol. 5 will be releasing. And, don't forget Tex Avery's Droopy: complete theatrical collection (see my review for Avery's Droopy set)

Fellow classic cartoon fans, get ready. This is perhaps best year for classic cartoon fans. We have Woody Woodpecker, Droopy, Popeye and another volume of LTGC series. I love it! Thanks for reading.",1177286400,60,2448,5.31266149870801
2815169,5,B000PC1PAW,"Now this is something I've been waiting on for YEARS! At long last, Woody Freakin' Woodpecker is FINALLY coming to DVD.!!! Didn't think we would see these for a long time, if even at all. Apparently the petitioning worked and Universal finally caved in to all the requests, no, DEMANDS for these long-lost classics.

I remember when these cartoons were shown almost daily on my local TV station, as well as being a vintage Saturday morning staple. Sad, but it seems that although cartoons are still shown on Saturday mornings, this practice still seems like a bygone era. Kids today don't seem to appreciate shows like these anymore. If it isn't ""SpongeBob SquarePants"", ""South Park"" or ""Family Guy"" or Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"", then it isn't cool. None of those are even the least bit cool, in my opinion. And if Cartoon Network or even Boomerang were worth their salt, they would be showing these in heavy rotation, instead of the latest incarnation of ""Scooby Doo"" (never liked that one, either). Suffice it to say, they don't and anymore, they aren't.

So, welcome back, Woody and friends. It's been long enough. We've missed you. And we'll see you on 7-24.",1176940800,37,1167,4.83
2815170,1,B000PC1PAW,"Ok.  So I received this just a few days ago and binged on every ACTUAL Woody Woodpecker episode.  Aside from the heavy film grain on some episodes, faded colors and I swear the outline drawing of some characters were non-existent, it was a treat to watch, however, it's missing 153 episodes!  It is advertised ""Relive all of the hilarious, crazy adventures of Woody Woodpecker, everyone's favorite wacky red-headed bird..."" and yes, goes onto to say 75 episodes.  But, I got as far as ""all"" in the description, because ALL means just that, every single one.  So it's missing over half the episodes of Woody Woodpecker.

Heck, it doesn't even allow you to finish out Season 1952.  So, unless they're hiding another disk somewhere, or if these are reversible discs (which they are not), I'm a bit disappointed to say the least.  One star for it not being stated anywhere 1940 - 1952 (half of it anyway).  I would have rather had ALL episodes as described rather than ""and friends.."" if it meant one or the other.  That and one star seems to grab peoples attention a bit better than a two star.  Really sorta bummed about this.  I won't even go into the fact that I used to be able to see a different episode each week in a penny arcade (think today's photo booth for a single person which would play an episode for a penny, later a nickle then later a dime).",1518825600,,1356,4.512295081967213

2815201,1,B000PC1PAW,"I bought this for grandkids to watch as I grew up on this cartoon.  The quality and formatting are fine.  I was remembering the wackiness of the character, Woody, but had forgotten much of what I had seen.  In previewing it I had forgotten how violent the cartoon format was. It seemed almost every cartoon had a cartoon character shooting at someone else or physically hurting another character.  I did not find it playful violence as one sees in such cartoons as, Tom and Jerry.  Incessant gun play, stereotypes of ethnic groups and dialect, and language, though not profane, strong in use through name-calling and overly negative in tone.  I decided the kids that were my intended audience did not need to be exposed to this.  Times have changed and though I grow weary of people overly concerned on today's theme of political correctness, I felt this is no longer a cartoon series needed for today's world and youth.",1457568000,,920,4.748427672955975

2815205,3,B000PC1PAW,"The Woody Woodpecker set was a way for me to explore the kind of animated work that Walter Lantz was producing for Universal in the 1930's, 40's, and 50's. Unlike many other cartoon directors, Walter Lantz was one of many animators that have been very influential BEFORE, DURING, and AFTER the Golden Age of American animation. Lantz is best known for Woody Woodpecker, one of the screwiest cartoon characters ever made. Woody's nuttiness greatly resembles the EARLY Daffy Duck from Warner Bros. and Screwy Squirrel from MGM; the similarites between Lantz and WB go so far as to being voiced by the man of a 1000 voices, Mel Blanc. While Walter Lantz did not become as influential as Walt Disney, Max Fleischer, or Tex Avery, his Woody Woodpecker cartoons are just as funny, if not funnier. It became apparent that Walter Lantz was aware of what was being made at WB and MGM (two of the most influential Hollywood cartoon studios in the 40's other than Disney) and tried to bring that lunacy into his cartoons. Another attribute I noticed from Lantz was how his late 40's post-war shorts still maintained fast, fluid character movements while other studios started slowing down on pacing and speed.

While everybody remembers Woody Woodpecker (along with his memorable laugh, which eerily found its way into a few Warner Bros. cartoons of the late 30's), the other cartoons in this set are just as entertaining. Included are a few of the Oswald The Lucky Rabbit cartoons from the early 30's (which Walter Lantz was asked to continue producing after animation god Walt Disney lost the rights to the character), Andy Panda cartoons (Lantz's first original character), Chilly Willy (who Lantz developed in the 50's), and Cartune Classics (Lantz's equivalent of Disney's Silly Symphonies, though they heavily resemble the Merrie Melodies from Warner Bros. in terms of contemporary settings and Hollywood caricatures). Also included are the 4 Cartunes (ALL on Disc 3) directed by the king of cartoons, Tex Avery! These 4 shorts were made after Avery left MGM around 1952-'53, but still retain his iconic fast-paced action and lunacy. Unfortunately, the rest of his non-Droopy work at MGM has yet to be released on DVD/Blu-Ray in the United States.

While Lantz's cartoons earn a 5-star rating, the visual quality of the cartoons sadly knocked it down to three. First off, the cartoons were simply remastered, not restored. Some of the cartoons here have VERY HEAVY film grain, while others have slightly faded colors. And second, these cartoons underwent the DVNR process, which caused some of the character outlines to be erased. However high the presets were set, the DVNR s VERY noticeable. Universal should learn from Warner Bros (though they also used DVNR in the past) when it comes to restoring classic animation. DVNR is NOT the answer!

I really cringe about the cartoons being dunked into DVNR, but I still recommend this set nonetheless for many reasons:
1. if you are a fan of Woody Woodpecker and remember watching him on Saturday morning
2. if you are a fan of Walter Lantz
3. if you are an animation buff or college student studying animation
4. if you are a foreigner and would like to enjoy a sampling of American pop culture
5. if you want to see good comedy
6. MOST IMPORTANTLY: this may be the only way to see these cartoons. As of now (12/22/2015), I have not heard anything about a Blu-Ray release or these cartoons appearing on streaming anytime soon.",1450742400,16,3469,4.886247877758914

2815247,5,B000PC1PAW,"Where Volume 1 contained all the theatrical shorts in chronological order from 1940 to 1952, volume 2 contains the remaining shorts shown in theatres, from ''Termites from Mars'' (1952) to ''Jittery Jester'' (1958).

Woody Woodpecker shorts did keep being produced after 1958, but they moved the format from theatre to television, as part of ""The Woody Woodpecker Show"". These shorts kept being produced all the way up to 1972. I guess this dvd collection doesn't count those...which is a shame.

In short, volume 1 and 2 of this amazing set contains every Woody Woodpecker shorts shown in theatres only (1940-1958), and NOT the remaining ones shown as part of ''The Woody Woodpecker Show'', which aired from 1958 to 1972.

2815289,5,B000PC1PAW,"Who here truly remembers Woody, Andy, Buzz, Ozwald, and the rest of the Walter Lantz stable?
I wouldn't think so.
Back in the day, Disney and Warner Brothers absolutely ruled the cartoon roost. All others came in a poor second, weather they deserved it or not.

That's why I absolutely love Woody Woodpecker. He was the underdog. Not that he didn't have his share of bombs and clunkers, but there are some real comedic gems buried in Woody's history, especially a little gem called ""Niagara Fools."" I really get the feeling that Jay Ward may have been inspired by this one. Made in 1956, it is truly one of the funniest and the best WW short ever made. It has a very simple formula. Woody overhears a Park Ranger bragging about his record of keeping thrill seekers from barreling it over the falls. Woody proceeds to drive the poor Ranger crazy. Woody is victorious.

Simple fun.  No pretentions Oscar material here, just simple fun.

Well worth the investment.",1371081600,4,961,4.7023809523809526

2815307,5,B000PC1PAW,"I loved Woody Woodpecker as a child, but I cannot remember any particular cartoons that I watched back then.  I watched these earliest cartoons and it dawned on me just what a brilliant commentary this was on the times that the audience was living in.  The early Woody Woodpecker is criminally insane, goes out looking for trouble, and we love him anyway!

Sure he's cute, little, and talented, but I think what Woody did in these cartoons was exactly what a lot of the stressed-out urbanites sort of fantisized about doing but of course would never actually do.  I think the humor in these cartoons hit home for a lot of people in a way that the rural Bugs Bunny never could.

I'm also a fan of ""Rocko's Modern Life"", and I see very much the same thing going on with Woody Woodpecker a half century earlier.  The big city is complex, stressful, and can drive someone nuts.  Woody Woodpecker I think was a nut on behalf of untold thousands who watched him in the theater, and if we pay attention we can gain a much greater understanding of urban life during the forties and fifties, including World War II.",1339891200,3,1106,4.5
2815308,5,B000PC1PAW,I haven't seen these cartoons in years and absoulty loved them even better than volume 1 I still hope universal has plans to release a volume 3 in the future it's been awhile since volume 2 has been out I wonder what the hold up is and if they still plan on releasing a volume 3.,1339804800,,279,4.0
2815309,5,B000PC1PAW,Woody Woodpecker is very funny. Mel Blanc was a genious voicing him-when he did mostly it was the laugh-and all the other chachors he voiced. All of the shorts on here are funny. I especially like Bathing Buddies where Woody tries to get his dime back after it falls down the bath tub drain and The Reckless Driver where Woody tries in vein to renew his drivers licence not to mention Sleep Happy  where woody sleeps the night away next to Wally Walrus who is kept awake by his snoring. All of them are good. Anyway this is funny and youll be disapointed if you don't get it. Especially if you watched theese as a kid like I did.,1339027200,,629,4.285714285714286
2815310,5,B000PC1PAW,Heres more of Woody Woodpecker who I said in an earlier review is very funny. I watched a lot of cartoons when I was little and Woody was one of my favorites. Unfortunately except for the laugh Mel Blanc had to give up doing the voice but this is still funny. Woody Woodpecker is the only charor that someone other than Mel Blanc can voice well-probably because its still Mel Blanc doing the laugh. One of my favorite shorts on this set is Niagra Fools where a co-worker tries to stop Woody from going over Niagra Falls in a barrell. Woody is very funny and youll be disapointed if you don't get this one as well.,1339027200,,613,4.293103448275862

I vaguely remember seeing some of woody's cartoons on tv as a child (he wasn't shown on tv as frequently as mickey mouse or bugs bunny); He is more simplified than other cartoon chrachters, but a very authentic 1940's screwball, very similar to bugs bunny. The restoration seems good, though sometimes the sound was a bit unclean and the cartoons are in their historical order (something Warner Bros. has yet to learn with their releases-see my previous reviews on the ""Looney Tunes Golden Collection""). It was espically intresting for me to see the 'Oswald the lukcy rabbit' b & w cartoons. I do hope Universal will continue releasing woody's and friends filmography (the sequel ends in 1958) and thus setting an important example for the other golden age cartoons yet to be digitally released.",1321488000,4,1131,6.1645569620253164

2815319,5,B000PC1PAW,"Hey kids, here's Walter Lantz with a wonderful collection of 75 vintage cartoons he made for Universal Pictures from the 1930's to 1960's.  There's even a vintage ""episode"" of THE WOODY WOODPECKER SHOW so you can relieve the once five-times-a-week experience of hearing Woody and Uncle Walter chirp the same intros. I have always preferred the Lantz Universal star stable to the much louder, much less gentle, and admittedly much funnier and much more popular Warner Bros. Looney Tunes crowd but then the Bugs Bunny stock company was always directed at adults as much as kids whereas the usually much gentler humor of the Woodpecker association is clearly aimed at children and their beautiful vivid storybook like colors make them extremely pleasing to the eye.  Naturally Woody dominates this set but there are a few Oswald the Rabbit, Andy Panda, and Chilly Willy cartoons on the collection as well as one-shot musical cartoons and titles from the ""Cartune Costars"" line including the short-lived Ma and Pa Kettle-type series MAW AND PAW.  The bonus features are very nice but of course the cartoons are the main attraction and it was really nice to see Woody again after all these decades.  I am really hoping for a Chilly Willy set though - I think the little impish penquin was nearly everybody's favorite Lantz creation once he came on the scene in the late 1950's much like Donald Duck overtook Mickey Mouse in actual popularity among the Disney cartoons years before.  The very young today will no doubt still love Woody and friends and we older kids will enjoy the sweet memories these bring back.

2815320,5,B000PC1PAW,I love this dvd set. I watched these cartoons as a kid in the 80's. Even though they are violent and show negative behavior I let my kids watch them. We all crack up.,1298678400,,166,3.911764705882353
2815321,5,B000PC1PAW,The collection of these cartoons that they were offering is really  excellent because it was exactly what I was looking  for so I am very satisfied with this purchase. Also the presentation of the three dvd's and the package of this product is very good. To anyone looking for a good entertaiment moments and also to show to their kids some of the classic cartoons this is the right selection.,1295740800,,393,4.6
2815322,2,B000PC1PAW,"I bought this for my nephew (7 years old) because he's really into old cartoons.  Well, I was surprised to see on the back of the box after we opened the set that the ""content is intended for mature collectors and may not be suitable for children"".  We watched some of it and I definitely wouldn't recommend for children that age.  I now noticed the small disclaimer on amazon that it's for children 10 and older.  I remember watching it when I was little, but watching it now, I do agree that it's a bit violent for small children... just wanted to let people know about this before they buy.",1293580800,8,593,4.363636363636363
2815323,5,B000PC1PAW,"This is the one I was looking for and the one I grew up on mostly.  I was a little disappointed with the first volume as it was all old Woody - i.e. loony crazy Woody with a big beak, wild eyes, and an obnoxious personality to match.  That's volume one Woody.  Some people actually prefer the old Woody - I never did.  I didn't like the original Daffy Duck either.  They were just too buffoonish and slapstick - a poor substitute for wit.  Volume 1 is still worth picking up - the Chilly Willy episodes are great as are some of the older more obscure cartoons - but the Woody cartoons - blah.

Now to Volume 2.  The Woody in these shows actually start to resemble the Woody on the DVD packaging.  The cartoons are presented in chronological order which lets you see Woody's shape and character evolve (into a much cuter, more intelligent and likable bird!) and the storylines become more clever and funny as well.  I have yet to finish these cartoons but I like where they're going.  Give me the 50s Woody over those that came before any day.  This is the set I was looking for.

DVD packaging is very well done.  For each of the 3 discs, there is a little write up on what was going on behind the scenes at the time and who was doing what. There's a page of explanation for each of the characters: Woody, Andy Panda, Chilly Willy, Wally Walrus, Buzz Buzzard, Knothead and Splinter, Space Mouse.

The episodes selection list is printed inside the box with dates for each episode.  There are lots of bonus features (which I haven't watched).  And most importantly, there are English SUBTITLES - yes!  Also, Spanish and French - voice in English only.

This is probably a better place to start than Vol 1 if you're introducing Woody to someone as he is quite charming here.. You can't really say that about pre-50s Woody.

From the notes:

""Walter Lantz's most popular character was first introduced in the 1940 Andy Panda cartoon Knock, Knock.  Originally voiced by Mel Blanc, Woody's best-known voice was Grace Stafford (Mrs Walter Lantz) who took over the role in 1951.  Two cartoons featuring Woody were nominated for an Academey Award for the Best Cartoon Short and his theme song was also nominated in the Best Song category.. New cartoons featuring Woody were a fixture in movie theatres from 1940 through 1972, making it the longest running series of cartoons ever produced.""",1292544000,14,2381,4.576832151300237
2815324,5,B000PC1PAW,"I got this mainly because its all the classic cartoons of Woody and friends. Todays cartoons have no idea of how to be funny or whats truely artistic. These classics must be saved and seen by todays youth, so that they can see what they've missed. There's no media company showing any of these classics as far as I know. These cartoons from the 30's, 40's and 50's are truely great.",1284940800,,382,4.394366197183099

The Dvd is excellent and the menus are really good.
No disappointment whatsoever.",1232841600,3,407,4.732394366197183
2815331,5,B000PC1PAW,"After the success of the first Woody Woodpecker collection last year, Universal tops it off with a second volume. It was an improvement over the previous set, and I mean that remastering wise. Let's get started on the cartoons in this set.

This collection contains:
45 Woody cartoons
5 Oswald the Lucky Rabbit Cartoons
10 Cartune Classics
5 Andy Panda shorts
5 Chilly Willy shorsts
5 Musical Miniatures

The run down on the cartoons:
By the fifties, Woody began to loose some of the energy he had a decade before. Also, he was under new direction. Most of his shorts in this set are directed by Don Patterson, Paul J. Smith and Alex Lovy. Don Patterson's cartoons are very well put together. Lovy's are missing something. And Paul Smith was using most of the same gags in his cartoons over and over again. However, Smith's cartoons aren't as bad as most people say. The Oswald cartoons and Cartune Classics are good aswell.

The Andy Panda cartoons are some of his best cartoons ever. My favorites are ""Mousie Come Home"" and ""The Pointer and The Painter."" And the Musical Miniatures are good if your looking for an animated music video.

The Chilly Willy shorts are great aswell. Most of these cartoons were originally drafted by Tex Avery before he left Walter Lantz studios, but they weren't made until after he left. But, Alex Lovy, Jack Hannah and Sid Marcus do great jobs on these shorts.

Special features for this set include:
12 Behind the Scenes featurrettes with Walter Lantz himself
A TV Pilot featuring Space Mouse and Sam and Simian
An entire episode of The Woody Woodpecker Show

Well, that's a quick rundown. If you like classic animations and you're a Woody Woodpecker fan looking for some more Woody, pick this set up. You'll love it.

Ha-ha-ha-ha!",1227916800,4,1766,4.751633986928105
2815332,5,B000PC1PAW,"I loved Woody Woodpecker as a child and since my 4 year old loves Tom & Jerry & Bugs Bunny, I fugured she might like this too. I was so right! She loves this DVD set. I was not worried it might look grainy or have bad sound but it is great. I had doubts at first because of the price but you get three DVD's and since she loves it, it's so worth the money. I'm also happy we can watch it together and equally enjoy it.",1224115200,,418,3.7613636363636362
2815333,5,B000PC1PAW,I enjoyed this product very much.  Good especially for kids.  The cartoons from the old days are much much better than now.,1215388800,5,123,4.545454545454546

2815335,4,B000PC1PAW,"Others have been very efficient at noting which cartoons are included, and several have mentioned the important information that ""Digitally re-mastered"" doesn't mean the same thing as ""restored"". I've always been a fan of the later ""Woody's"" so for me this collection was an essential buy. But what I thought was most intriguing was the additional bonus features, extensive and informative tutorials about the inner workings of the studio, hosted by Walter Lantz. These were a terrific exploration of old-fashioned cartoon production, and were a great instructional guide to those who have an interest. Some of the early Fleischer compilations have fascinating documentaries, but the special features here are worth the price of the set, and the cartoons ""Alley to Bali"" and ""Under the Counter Spy"" are wonderful shorts to own for collectors.",1212451200,6,842,5.338345864661654
2815336,4,B000PC1PAW,"This DVD is a great representation of the Walter Lantz Studio: in addition to Woody Woodpecker's best cartoons are the rarely seen surreal, black and white Oswald the Lucky Rabbit shorts from the 30's, the jazzy Swing Symphonies of the 40's, and four classic Tex Avery directed cartoons from the 50's. They are presented under their own theme heading in chronological order, uncensored, making it easier to see the progression of the characters and the studio as a whole.

In my opinion, the period between 1943 to 1948 represents the high point of quality at the Lantz Studio, and most of those cartoons are contained on this DVD. The Lantz cartoons vacillated between Disney cuteness (Andy Panda) and Warner Bros. rowdyism (Woody Woodpecker), but was neither as slick as Disney, nor as truly funny as the Looney Tunes. However, they are still quite good, even if they don't measure up to the best of those other two studios. If you love classic animated cartoons, then this set is a great bargain. Woody is at his anarchistic apex in the 40's cartoons, and it's a revelation if one has only seen the tamer, poorly animated Woody from the 50's. (Like The Simpsons today, a lot of cartoons from the 40's were not meant for small children. Some of the cartoons on this set contain ethnic humor, good ol' fun slapstick violence, ""cheesecake"" sexy girls, drinking and other sublime pleasures.)

While the selection of the cartoons is topnotch, the set is not perfect. Nearly half of the cartoons are slightly marred by the DVNR (digital video noise reduction) process, which ""smears"" the ink lines on the characters (apparently, the computer assumes the ink line to be scratches on the film and ""erases"" them). I've seen worse on other sets, but it's still noticeable here to those with a sharp eye. Some of the prints are high in contrast and the film grain is quite prominent. It's a shame Universal didn't do a proper restoration, as these cartoons would definitely benefit with their glorious full technicolor hues at their sharpest. Still, this set is the only way you can see the cartoons these days, so I highly recommend it.",1210896000,7,2129,4.814207650273224
2815337,5,B000PC1PAW,excellent...recommend this for everyone. if you want to laugh then let this set do it for you. classic humor.,1209859200,,109,4.7894736842105265
2815338,3,B000PC1PAW,"What's not to like about Woody Woodpecker?

Even though volume 2 contains the Paul J Smith efforts who came in on budget, but short on comedy,these toons are a hoot.  My kids, who have only seen a few Woodpeckerss, loved this set.  Watching some of the episodes, I remembered these played at lunch-time during summers.  Ahh, what memories.

The set includes 75 cartoons starring Woody, Oswald, chilly Willy, Andy Panda, Buzz Buzzard, and Lucky rabbit.  We can't forget Knothead and Splinter either.  Walter Lantz is remembered for many things, and Woddy is just one of them.  If you don't like one cartoon, just skip ahead, you're sure to find one that keeps you laughing.  Tex Avery isn't too bad either!

The special features include TV pilots, a TV show episode, and 'behind the scenes'.

All worth the money.

I remember watching this one with my brother when we were little and we laughed so hard we cried.  I was excited to see it in this collection.  Though not as funny now as it was when I was a child, it did provide a few laughs, but most important, made me relive my child hood for a little bit.",1208736000,26,568,3.93859649122807
2815340,5,B000PC1PAW,"Let me start with my opinion and then move on to details; this is an ungodly great collection of animated shorts spanning the breadth of Walter Lantz's heyday.  This collection contains 75 animated short in all their pristine, somewhat un-restored, original glory.  Collectors can buy this without reservation based on the price, quality of the product and the sheer amount of unedited material.
As great as this collection is, I cannot caution parents more strongly about buying this for your kids, let alone letting them watch it without supervision.  As stated in the amazon synopsis and on the box of the DVD set; much of this is entertainment originally intended for adults during the WWII era.  Unless you have no qualms about your kids watching cartoons with racial and sexual bigotry, sexual suggestion, violence and vice, I highly suggest you pre-view this material prior to letting your kids watch.

With that said, lets move on to the details; first details for collectors/grownups and then more info to help parents out.

COLLECTORS

I'm going to try and not repeat much of what's been said in many of the good reviews here.  My efforts will be more focused on the DVD quality and what you may or may not remember about ""Woody Woodpecker and Friends"" when compared to its contemporaries and why I think this is such a great collection.

-A WORD ABOUT ""RESTORATION""
A few reviews here voice disappointment over shorts in this collection not being ""restored"" to their original brilliance.  There has also been mention of some edge trimming of certain shorts but I have yet to notice them (I have no point of reference).  Evidence of the sinister DVNR process is limited (certainly not as bad as appears in ""Tex Avery's Droopy"").  I would argue that these ""un-restored"" films are mostly in their ""original brilliance"".  Upon release, none of these films were ever viewed without scratches, dust, hair and any number of flaws.  The shorts in this collection appear to be from excellent master material; the color very vibrant, the pictures only mildly blemished, the sound deep and resonant (but not without flaw).  My advice to Universal Studios; if the quality of all your master prints are this good, don't bother restoring them.  This might be the reason this set is relatively inexpensive.

-FULL ANIMATION IS NOT ALWAYS GREAT ANIMATION.
Don't get me wrong; most of these shorts are very good animation.  However, when compared to their contemporaries (Warner Brothers, MGM, Paramount/Fleischer, and Disney) Lantz's animation studio was a bit of a stepchild. The problems were not always animation technique or artistic prowess as much as animation style.  Good animators are also good actors.  Even with Mel Blanc doing the voice for the first 4 shorts, the character animation is lacking in expressiveness and refined, meaningful motion.  As a result, the early shorts have jokes and gags that aren't quite as funny as they could be in the hands of great animators and writers.  However, the early animators were technically very good, high quality artists. Other technical problems include fluctuations in coloring, continuity gaffes (things disappear, then reappear, etc.), and some strange voice-over anomalies (character voice changes or voices from nowhere).  All that said I enjoy the older Lantz efforts for their sheer craziness and detailed drawing style.

-OLDER IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER (BUT SOMETIMES IT IS)
An actual high point of the Lantz studio brought Woody Woodpecker near par with the other studios.  Late in the 1940s several Disney transplants upgraded the already good animation in Lantz's studio.  However, you will notice a slight softening of Woody Woodpecker.  He becomes more the vengeful foil rather than the zany antagonist.  Despite the improvement in animation style, the stories themselves start to lose their crazy, comedic edge.  However, if you like your cartoon stories more narrative based than sight-gag based, this is a good thing.  As Woody moves into the 50s, he becomes a fairly passive (yet mischievous) character and the animation loses some of its wild pacing and expressiveness.  All that said, I can't say any of them are really bad (actually, most of them are still pretty good).

-TEX AVERY SHORTS ARE A BARGAIN AT ANY PRICE
Is there an animation fan that does not go nuts over Tex Avery cartoons?  In this collection we get 4 of them; ""The Legend of Rockabye Point"", ""I'm Cold"", ""Crazy Mixed up Pup"" and ""Sh-h-h-h-h-h"".  ""Crazy Mixed-up Pup"" might be one of Tex's best.  Add this to the ""Droopy"" and ""Looney Tunes"" collections and Tex Avery's catalogue starts to fill out.  The MGM library (Turner?) really needs to get moving!

-THEY ARE UNCUT (AND IN ORDER)
These shorts are obviously (mostly?) uncut.  Based on the amount of bigotry in some of these films, it is clear little if anything was left out.  As far as I know, most of these shorts were cut or not shown at all for television.  So you can stop your griping (if you ever did); all the violence, sex and ugliness of the 30s, 40s and 50s is here to view.  Sometimes this is great.  Sometimes it's downright embarrassing.  No matter how you feel about ""questionable"" content, the choice of what we show our kids has been given to us; REJOICE!!

The perfect segue to....

PARENTS

Outside the normal cartoon violence you can expect in any animated short made before 1965, most of the cartoons in this collection are fairly kid-safe.  If you have trouble with your kids seeing cartoon violence, don't even bother buying this.  However, if you are still inclined to let your kids watch, in a vast collection as this, a significant number of shorts contain sexually suggestive or bigoted material that an animation fan like me will not let my kids see for good reason.  Let me reiterate; kids were usually not the intended audience.

I have devised a little guide to help parents decide if this is a collection they would share with their kids or at least help parents be more selective when watching with their kids.  Again, my advice is this; view them before showing to your kids.

LEGEND:
SEX (could include any/combinations of the following); Alluring walks, Full body engorgements, Shapely women in very tight and revealing clothing,  Men and women dramatically swooning for each other, men ogling curvy women.

BIGOTRY; Stereotypes of many races and cultures (mostly African descent, some Asian, Native American, Middle-Eastern and Appalachian American), Natives as sub-humans, the term ""China-boy"", Blacks in roles of servitude, segregation, African American stereotypical language.

VICE; Depictions of inebriation, Drug references, Smoking and Gambling.

DISC ONE;
VICE; 1, 24. SEX; 1, 3, 14,15.  BIGOTRY; 3, 12, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.

DISC TWO;
VICE; 4, 7, 18.  SEX; 12, 23, 24.  BIGOTRY; 16, 22, 23, 24.

DISC THREE;
VICE; 13, 16, 21, 22, 24.  SEX; 12, 14, 22.  BIGOTRY; 14, 21, 22, 23, 24.

Please keep in mind that this is just a guide (and I can't guarantee I caught all the ""Smoking"" episodes).  This looks like an overwhelming amount of ""questionable"" material.  To be fair, much of it is what I consider ""mild"" or fairly innocent; that's my opinion.  However, this guide is here to help you decide for yourself.  You will notice that 19 of the ""offending"" shorts are in the ""20s"" range (more than half).  These are the added ""Swing Symphonies"" and ""Cartune Classics"" and not ""Woody Woodpecker"".  These have what I think is the most offensive content and the ones I wont' let my kids watch for the most part.

SYNOPSIS
When you add it all up, this is a nearly perfect collection.  The fact that I feel the need to warn parents serves notice to collectors that you can rejoice that these uncut shorts are available in such a huge collection.  Though DVNR was used, it is rarely evident.  The quality is not always perfect but still very good.  Considering the nice packaging, price and the amount of uncut content, I have to give this collection 5 Stars.  For parents, I can't recommend this as a gift for younger kids or as a ""plug and play"".  If you care about what your kids see, you need to be a participant while they watch this.  Sorry for the length.  I hope you find this helpful.",1208736000,24,8218,4.898550724637682
2815341,4,B000PC1PAW,"This set proves that there is life in that woodpecker yet!!  I bought this, originally, for the ""FRIENDS"", and believe me, I was not disappointed, with extremely funny one shots like ""DIG THAT DOG"" and wonderful musical offerings like ""PIXIE PICNIC"", and there is the ever-adorable Sarah Berner voicing the baby Andy Panda, getting a magic wand mailed to him in ""100 PYGMIES AND ANDY PANDA"" and still more of those jazzy Swing Symphonies.  Such cartoons make me hope for a third volume with, perhaps, the best of the later WOODY cartoons (if the chore isn't that excrutiating), reversing the numbers a little and giving us far more of the ""FRIENDS"" as there is still so much to be restored and issued in this series, especially if one remembers the Columbia House volumes that preceeded these.

Yet, the one thing that I was amazed about was the fact that I enjoyed the 1950's WOODY WOODPECKER output more than i thought i would, with voice work by Dal McKennon and Daws Butler.  ""HYPNOTIC HICKS"", ""WRESTLING WRECKS"" and ""REAL GONE WOODY"" being stand-outs and fond memories from my daily viewings of ""THE WOODY WOODPECKER SHOW"" back in the day.  I even liked ""TO CATCH A WOODPECKER"", a cartoon that is not only included but whose story board is given narration in one of the behind-the-scenes special features.

If there is a third and final set, we could get more of those strange 1930's titles like ""SHE DONE HIM RIGHT"", ""JOLLY LITTLE ELVES"" and ""CANDYLAND"", all of which are included here.  They sometimes resemble the experiments that came from Warner Brothers cartoons of this period (maybe it has something to do with the voice work; in one documentary spoof or newsreel spoof, we even hear the familiar narration that we'd also gotten in Warners titles of this type created by Tex Avery).  The Lantz toons of the 1930's can't be entirely confused with the SILLY SYMPHONIES or other one shots as they have a spikier edge, even though they can sometimes seem like direct steals from the earliest Disney musical series.  I'm just a sucker for any cartoons from the 1930's.  It is an era that isn't seen at all anymore, so why not restore what's left of the source material and give it one last go-round!  In the '30's, Walter Lantz was still finding his way, but then I think we can say that about practically any studio, except perhaps for Max Fleischer Productions which had established itself and its humor quite prominently at that time, standing out beyond all others!!

Ah, but I digress...  It would also be nice to check out more of the earliest ANDY PANDA shorts like ""ANDY PANDA GOES FISHING"", ""MOUSE TRAPPERS"" and ""CRAZY HOUSE"" which gives old grumpy Papa Panda his comeuppance, although baby Andy is at his best when he, alone, is the focal point of the cartoon.  The first three make me wish that Lantz had allowed the baby panda to wander off into little adventures with Mr. Whippletree, a Rochester-like turtle, reluctantly by his side to keep him out of the usual trouble he finds himself in.  We have the first and third of these earliest cartoons, thankfully!

One other cartoon that I am utterly delighted is here is ""FIVE 'N' DIME"", an OSWALD cartoon that has a thoroughly wonderful production number around the popular hit ""I Found a Million Dollar Baby (In a Five 'n' Ten Cent Store)"".  The music and soundtrack of this title is enough to keep you wishing for more of these, and I know there has to be more!!

Yes, there is life in this studio, and I'm glad that these volumes are around to show it off!  These first two volumes are testaments to this, and I'm so glad that we now all have access to them.",1208563200,7,3631,4.6453125
2815342,5,B000PC1PAW,"""If Woody had gone straight to the police, this would NEVER have happened..."" (from BUNCO BUSTERS)

I share some fans' viewpoint that the 1940s Woody starring vehicles are the best. But many Woody viewers appreciate the 1950s Woody shorts -- the body of this collection -- for other reasons. These are the Woody shorts from which generations of nostalgia come.
""The story you are about to see is a big fat lie..."" ""Now I've gotcha, Chief Charlie Horse!"" ""YAAAAAY!"" ""Make with them keys, Maestro, and don't stop!"" Face it: you remember these beloved Woody cliches even if you no longer recall the specific cartoons (UNDER THE COUNTER SPY, CHIEF CHARLIE HORSE, NIAGARA FOOLS, CONVICT CONCERTO) from which they come. You're getting them. All of them.

And that's not even starting on the supporting features, a mini-anthology of highly inspired choices. Andy Panda's MOUSIE COME HOME envisions codependence in crazed cartoon form; Chilly Willy's HALF-BAKED ALASKA has its unforgettable patter routine (""More butter? More syrup?""); and THE HAMS THAT COULDN'T BE CURED is a hot jazz Three Little Pigs send-up.
Finally there's Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, the star Walter Lantz inherited from an earlier (1927-28) Walt Disney/Ub Iwerks regime at Universal. Disney reacquired some rights to Oswald in 2006; last year saw a selection released in their Walt Disney Treasures line. But Universal retained rights to its own Oswald material, and Woody Vol. 2 brings us another small, tempting quintet.
The inventive, vital black and white classics are a fascinatingly different viewing experience from anything else on this box, as wannabe hero Oswald is smacked by Tex Avery's earliest gags. A long-lost color Oswald featuring girlfriend Fanny, SPRINGTIME SERENADE, is here too.

With new Oswald dolls and merchandise now available in stores, one can only hope Universal will tie in by taking the next step -- to release a multi-volume disc set on the Woody model, but with Oswald as the main character. From CHILLY CON CARMEN's pre-Betty Boop hooch dance to the cyborg T-Rex of STONE AGE, from the impossible ocean tricks of PERMANENT WAVE to Oswald's surrealist, pre-Wackyland adventures on MARS, there are dozens of these classics crying for a release.
Throw in a few pre-Lantz Oswalds as extras, and we're so there.",1207872000,51,2304,5.1550802139037435
2815343,5,B000PC1PAW,"This second Woody Woodpecker collection is an improvement over the first set.  There is no DVNR as far as I can tell, though the transfers are on the dark side.

The Woody Woodpecker's really hit the skids quality wise on Disc Three, but there is SO much to enjoy elsewhere on the set that you won't mind.  Fan favorites ""Convict Concerto"" (Woody plays the piano to hide a crook), ""Bunco Busters"" (""If Woody had gone straight to police...""), and ""Half Baked Alaska"" (Chilly Willy on a pancake binge... ""More butter? More syrup?"") are included, as are some bizarre 30s shorts like ""Puppet Show"" (featuring the use of live-action marionettes) and ""A Haunting We Will Go"".  Andy Panda classics, including ""Dog Tax Dodgers"" with extensive animation by Disney legend Fred Moore, are here too.

2815344,4,B000PC1PAW,"This set will have 45 Woody Woodpecker Cartoons spanning from 1952-1958.  The trouble is that director Paul J. Smith (boo) was only interested in bringing the cartoons in under budget, creativity was not an issue for him.  He started taking over Woody in 1955 and the cartoons started to became mediocre.

The GOOD NEWS is that there will also be non-Smith Woodys and 30 Walter Lantz non-Woody cartoons produced from 1930-1960 in this set, and these classics will be well worth getting this for!  With DVDs you can just skip over the Paul J. Smith clunkers and cue the menu to these.

The Classic Cartoons will include these new-to-DVD titles:
SHE DONE HIM RIGHT (1933)  w/Pooch The Pup  B&W
FIVE AND DIME (1933)  w/Oswald Rabbit  B&W
WAX WORKS (1934)  w/Oswald Rabbit  B&W

After watching the B&W cartoons on disc 1, I want to add that I am surprised at how well the Lantz studio imitaded other studios.
Take ""SHE DONE HIM RIGHT"", if you did not see the production credits you would swear that you were watching a 1933 Max Fleischer Betty Boop cartoon.
""A HAUNTING WE WILL GO"" may first remind you of a Disney cartoon, but with the racist ""Lil' Eightball"" starring character it reminds me more of the MGM/Harmon-Ising ""BOSKO IN A HAUNTED HOUSE"" cartoon.

The real interesting surprise is the last Oswald presented on this disc, ""THE PUPPET SHOW"". This strangely combines live puppets with an Animated Oswald as the puppeteer. At first I thought he was added to an existing puppet short, but as the film goes on there is an animated dream sequence of the puppets. Was Universal trying to savce an aborted puppet film project? Was the use of live action puppets a cost-saving device to get the years productions back on budget? Either way, it makes for a nice departure from the standard Lantz cartoons of that time.

""FAIR TODAY"" is a weak Tex Avery inspired cartoon, ""JOLLY LITTLE ELVES"" reminds you of some Leon Slessinger/Warner Brothers cartoons & ""CANDY LAND"" could be from any studio of that time.

It appears that Lantz did not get a real style of his own until Woody Woodpecker & Andy Panda came on the scene.

It would be hard for me to consider buying a volume 3, but this set is still well worth getting!",1201651200,65,4117,4.667128987517337
2815345,5,B000PC1PAW,"For me, this was mostly a nostalgia trip. I was and am a fan of the Warner Brothers/Looney Tunes cartoons, primarily. But it was always a treat on the rare occasions when I did get to see Woody Woodpecker; like Yogi Bear and friends, he was there, just not as accessible. Now at last he is, and it's permanent, and recapturing a part of one's childhood as cheerful as this guy can't be bad, right?",1200700800,2,397,4.306666666666667
2815346,3,B000PC1PAW,"This is Vol I of the classic cartoon collection:
As a kid, growing up in the 1980's, I didn't realize that this show went as far back as the 1940's. The Woody Woodpecker I grew up watching in the 1980's was actually a series called ""The Woody Woodpecker Show"" from 1957. Which along with Walter Lantz, also featured the legendary brilliant master Tex Avery. With such characters as Splinter, Buzz Buzzard, Gabby Gator, Chilly Willy, Bessie Beary, Maw, Hickory, Ms. Meany(voiced by Grace Stafford) and although there are some Tex Avery cartoons featured on here, there still isn't enough.
To potential buyers out there, this ONLY features, (especially the first two DVD's) very early cartoons of Woody Woodpecker as well as the ""Cartune Classics and Swing Symphonies. By the third DVD, Woody Woodpecker gets a little better with the addition to Chilly Willy. But still there are alot of Chilly Willy cartoons missing.

Most people already know that the Woody Woodpecker from the 1940's, very early 50's is a lot more belligerent and psychotic than later years much like Bugs Bunny, since their character was still developing. Then you have your fans that say only the older version of Woody is better. 1940-1952. I always felt that the old Woody only carried a one dimensional plot that lacks pace with very similar situations. When Tex Avery was involved with Woody Woodpecker, (1958-1967) there was more variety. There are a few features on here that didn't quite qualify for a five star review. The video quality is subpar to say the least. Digitally remastered means digitally remastered instead of what they did. by using a video processor to rid of ""image noise"" and ""dull color"" by adding less noise and more color, but at the same time making the picture blurry. Falling far from their promise. Especially for a three disk set, there could have been alot more bonus features, but instead we are left with very small samples of Walter Lantz behind the scenes. The lack of Gabby Gator also didn't sit well.

I'm hoping volume II has more of the cartoons I'm looking for, such as Ms. Meany and Gabby Gator, but anyway, this Vol 1 is still a nice collection to have, that you will still enjoy if you're a fan of the show.

2815355,2,B000PC1PAW,"I love nostalgic cartoons.  Especially when Tex Avery is involved!  But this set seems underwhelming in terms of content.  Had the cartoon titles list appeared on the front, I may not have bought it.

And with the high number of ""Chilly Willy"" cartoons available, it's a shame to see only 5 of them here, in lieu of a bunch of unremarkable 1940s cartoons.  Indeed, most of the CW cartoons were lackluster as well (the ""Legend of Rockabye Point"" being the most creative standout, and Tex Avery directed it.  ;-)

Now I don't know about how you felt when you popped in the disc, but if these episodes are examples of ""digitally remastered"", why did they bother to do a thing?  Yes, the colors were remastered.  But the flicker, graininess, film scratches, dust specks, et cetera, are as present as ever.  (Plus, some episodes' edges are clearly clipped; details from the edges such as ""thought balloons"" are cut off.  Surely a better film-disc transfer could have been made?)

However, it was fun to watch many Woody Woodpecker cartoons again; it's nice to revisit the times they were made in; even if said times were a bit unsavory in terms of occasional sexist or racist content.  Still, this was the 1940s...

Still, for $35 it is a bit pricey.  Other cartoon collections, which usually center around one classic character, cost more or less the same, but have had more time devoted to them.  Every time I see ""& friends"" or other ""throw 'em all in"" collections, I know it's going to be a grab bag and not a complete set nor an anthology.  But I will say this - the cartoons do appear to be completely uncut; un-PC jokes and all.  For that alone, $35 isn't a bad price.  But when I read ""remastered"", I was expecting something a bit better and competing cartoon titles of the same era look virtually pristine; were the master films kept in really such a bad shape?",1189036800,9,1865,4.580060422960725

1) The set doesn't indicate whether all episodes from that period have been released. It is chronologically edited, but I have no idea whether it is a complete set. This is a major flaw, in a sense, for a true collector, which is the buyer. It is obvious that there is material for at least 2 more sets (after all, there are 198 classic cartoons from Woody - and those are all that mattered).

2) There are about 60 Chilly Willy cartoons available - so, especially after seeing a preview of them on the set, it screams for a Chilly Willy set in the near future.

Also, the quality is great...as this is the first Woody collection purchased by me in any format. Lord knows many of us have had to suffer with faded prints of early Woody cartoons over the years (public domain?). Pantry Panic comes to mind. Great to see Drooler's Delight again. The bonus features are great and very informative, and the only things missing here are audio commentaries...something we've all become accustomed to in light of other recent collections. There are cartoons missing here as well, but perhaps if this sells well, there will be at least another volume released.

2815371,5,B000PC1PAW,"I think this collection might be my favorite television DVD collection out there. Sure, i love ""The Simpsons"" and ""Seinfeld,"" but I can catch those in syndication on a regular basis. However, I haven't seen Woody Woodpecker and Friends since I was a kid, and this collection constitutes one of the best samplings out there, in my humble opinion.

The collection consists of 3 strong DVD's, with loads of Woody. Out of the 75 collected ""cartunes,"" 45 feature the red-headed instigator in some of his wackiest hijinks. As a kid, I always thought the early ones were the best, and while Woody is pretty ugly in his debut (and first couple of episodes), nonetheless he is at his side-splitting best. You get healthy doses of Wally Walrus (my favorite Woody foil), and Buzz Buzzard (another favorite), together with a smattering of other characters (Andy Panda, whom I never really cared for, makes a couple of appearances in the ""Woody"" features, for example).

In addition to the Woody cartoons, the viewer is also treated to some of the other ""Cartune"" favorites, such as the ""Oswald the Rabbit,"" ""Andy Panda,"" ""Chilly Willy,"" ""Swing symphonies"" and others that don't really have a characterization. These are a mixed bag - I was never really a fan of Andy, although I enjoyed his cartoons presented here. I love Chilly Willy, but Oswald really did nothing for me. As a kid, I always hated the non-character-related ""cartunes,"" and here is no exception. Of course, this is a matter of personal preference, but I feel the ""Swing Symphonies"" and the generic ""Cartunes"" are of a lower quality all-around. Thankfully, this only makes up 15 total cartoons, and a couple of these ARE watchable (I actually liked ""Crazy mixed-up pup""). I am still amazed that somehow, Siam (Thailand) is considered an Arab nation, judging by the costumes of the characters, but what are you going to do?

I am sad that some (well, all, but it really shows in some cases) of the cartoons weren't restored - there is a definite change in sound and visual quality from 'Tune to 'Tune. I love some of the ""plots"" present (in one of my all-time favorites, Woody poses as the baby boy of Wally Walrus. Wally then tortures his son with a ""comeback ball,"" before deciding to do away with him via dynamite).

I enjoyed most of the extras on this set. I was particularly pleased with the late Walt Lantz show telling the story of his origin. He claims to have created the technique of combining live action with animation, and also has absolutely no sense of a timeline (he claims that a cartoon he wrote regarding confidence and the Great Depression led to a job offer - in 1929. Hmmmm). The lone stinker of the bunch was the Woody Halloween episode - it just doesn't have the ""oomph"" of the other episodes!

Nonetheless, the flaws mentioned are slight. I am overjoyed at this collection, and look forward to future ones! Huh huh huh huh huh!",1186444800,,2907,4.725838264299803

2815373,5,B000PC1PAW,"For anyone who ever grew up on these cartoons, or is interested in animation, this is definitely a must have.  I reccommed the review by Gord Wilson if you want something more in-depth, although I rate it higher than he, simply because these have languished in the vaults at Universal far to long and deserved to be seen and enjoyed.  And these are in tip-top condition!!!!!!

However, a few impressions of my own:  First, remember that some of the earlier ones were originally drawn in and around World War II, and it was common fodder to make jokes about rationing and so forth; someone without any knowledge of that time would likely miss the humor.  The humor in these is also somewhat adult oriented - in some of the Oswald cartoons (a pretty thinly disguished version of Mickey Mouse, right down to the high pitched squeaky voice)you have some adult themes. Also, a number of the more famous actors/comedians of the era are included - Laurel and Hardy, Shirley Temple, Al Jolson (who was a white actor doing a style of comedy called blackface), which also may not be understood by someone who is too young.

Still, I reccomend these without hesitation to anyone!",1186185600,3,1168,4.700980392156863
2815374,4,B000PC1PAW,"First the packaging. This set is a textbook case of how to make an absolutely great DVD set. No annoying ads when you start the discs. Easy to navigate menu that makes watching individual cartoons easy and fun. Some of the cartoons, however, are simply three stars. The box has a disclaimer that the set is intended for collectors and ""may not be suitable for children"". ""There's a difference between violence and slapstick"", Walt Lantz once said. Nevertheless, he edited some of these 'toons when they appeared in 1970 on The Woody Woodpecker Show. These are every bit as violent as vintage Tom and Jerry 'toons, and parents have to make the same call. My view is that kids remember characters, not stories, and have an innate ""cartoon sense"" which enables them to tell ""toons"" from ""reality. ""Toons"" are sometimes worse, but often better than ""reality"". Parents' real concern should be the extreme ""live-action"" shows on the rest of the airwaves.

That said, parents doing cartoons without cable will find this a perfect set. It's easy to play one cartoon a day as if it were on TV. Both kids and collectors will appreciate the bonuses in this set, which include one full show and six segments from the Woody Woodpecker Show. This innovative program combined live action Lantz and animated Woody in the studio, Lantz showing kids how to draw cartoons. I would love to have that whole series on DVD. This also recalls the approach of the other Walt (Disney), beginning with the Disneyland show, of similarly mixing live action and animated characters. However, the live Lantz makes very clear the difference between the 'toons and the live animators drawing them, and can say, ""hey kids, let's watch this cartoon together"". The key word is ""together"". This echoes the live- host format that launched TV cartoons, and which I feel is the way they ought to be shown, with adult hosts ""showing"" cartoons.

The 75 'toons on three discs in this set seem like a bonanza, especially given the paucity of Lantz material released up until now. There are 45 Woody 'toons (dating from 1940- 1952); 5 Oswald Rabbit from the Lantz studio years (1930- 1933); 5 Andy Pandy (1939- 1949); 5 Chilly Willy (1953- 1956), 5 Swing Symphonies (1941- 1945) and 10 Cartune Classics, the catch-all title for other 'toons (1933- 1955). These 'toons are remastered, which means simply transferred to DVD, not restored, however, they're all very good prints.

This sounds like the full comport until you realize that Lantz made 198 shorts, and start noting what's not here. ""Musical Moments from Chopin"" (1947) is often considered a high point. It's listed under the ""Woody"" 'toons in this set, even though it also stars Andy Panda, and was one of four ""Musical Miniatures"" that played in theaters. There were originally fifteen Swing Symphonies, and 185 cartoons were syndicated in the 1970s.

Shamus Culhane's cartoons like ""Barber of Seville"" are interesting for their fast- pacing, but as with many other studios, numerous vintage era Lantz 'toons are mostly strung together sight gags. Disney likely was responsible for bringing story and continuity into cartoons, although Chuck Jones also made good use of it in the Michael Maltese stories starring Bugs Bunny, notably the far more developed ""Rabbit of Seville"", which one cannot help comparing with Culhane's similarly titled 'toon.

If you like the modern era, as I do, this collection merely wets one's whistle, with Tex Avery's ""Crazy, Mixed Up Pup (with a voice reminiscent of Huckleberry Hound). The third disc drops off right before ""Termites from Mars"", one of the best.  Annoyingly, the Lantz show segments make reference to these 'toons, which are not included in the set. Nevertheless, this is a beautiful set for collectors, and a long- overdue recognition of the Lantz Studio. Now, where are the Terrytoons?",1186099200,62,3849,4.978227060653188
2815375,3,B000PC1PAW,"Don't get me wrong...I love this box set, but I thought they left out a ton of woody cartoons in this box set! Is this now one of those things that Universal doesn't have the rights to EACH and every woody cartoon???
When I used to catch the Woody Woodpecker show on TV, there were quite a few skits there were HYSTERICAL!!! What happend to that famous Woody Cartoon with the following detective in just about every scene that kept saying ""IF WOODY WOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT TO THE POLICE, THIS WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPEND""...
Or the one where he had a blind date with a sexy voice over the phone, only to visit her and see that the lady woodpecker was about 500lbs???

I pre-ordered this box set and I felt like They really left out a ton of woody cartoons...Will there possibly be a VOL 2?? And Do I have to wait another 20 years for this?? Overall, I've waited a long time for this and I felt Like I didn't get what I paid for.  There are waaay too many pre-woody cartoons and the real funny ones I waited for were non-existant.",1185840000,4,1027,4.2615384615384615
2815376,4,B000PC1PAW,"This is quite an impressive collection, far more than I would have originally expected.  There are even cartoons included here that toon fans would never see anywhere else...and, best of all, this set is being marketed to the proper audience, adult animation history collectors.  Now, you can fully enjoy cartoons like ""PIED PIPER OF BASIN STREET"" and ""BOOGIE WOOGIE BUGLE BOY OF COMPANY B"" completely uncut, along with absolute rareties like ""PASS THE BISQUETS, MIRANDY"" with a fine vocal performance by none other than Pinto Culvig!

Here's hoping this is the first of many volumes on this seldom-seen series of golden age cartoons.  There are plenty more interesting titles that should be unearthed, dusted off and used in this collection, perhaps much, much more OSWALD THE LUCKY RABBIT and ANDY PANDA (""I wanna be inna newsweew!"") the next time around.  Genuinely worth every cent!!",1185753600,4,887,5.131944444444445
2815377,5,B000PC1PAW,"Watching these Woody Woodpecker theatricals really took me back to my early adolescence.  OK, I wasn't around when they were actually in the theaters, but I've seen them many times on TV, as they were adapted to TV after the fact.  Favorites include ""The Screwball,"" ""The Dizzy Acrobat,"" ""Ski For Two,"" ""The Dippy Diplomat,"" and ""The Great Who-Dood-It.""  The Chilly Willy cartoons are great, and feature Smedley the Dog in a couple of instances. Add to that ""Crazy Mixed-up Pup,"" a one-off which was a scream then, and is still hilarious.  There's not much that's bad here, but I'd have to say that Oswald the Lucky Rabbit is downright twisted.  Makes you wonder what was going through Lantz's mind in those days.

I'm hoping they do a second volume made up of some of the TV show classics.  Some of those include the episode with the cuckoo-clock maker, Professor Dingledong the taxidermist, the bell tower and the butler, Gabby Gator, Dooley (conspicuously absent in this set), the quiz show episode where ""The Thinker"" tells us what he thinks about smoking, and some of the one-offs and limited runs, like The Beary Family and Milford, ""The Smart One.""

I'll be waiting with baited breath.",1185753600,,1192,4.83743842364532
2815378,5,B000PC1PAW,"This IS the best Woody Woodpecker collection you'll ever get, because most all the great Woody toons from the 40's are here. The 1940's Woody was voiced by an uncredited Mel Blanc (although sped up) and was ruined when the voice was taken over by Walter Lantz's wife, Gracie. Gracie seems like a nice lady but the voice of Woody should've been left as it was - even if Blanc quit, Walter should've found a similar voice. The maniacal laff was gone (replaced by Gracie's sad imitation), as was Woody's original zany, half-crazed appearance. In between the 40's Woody and Gracie's Woody, for some reason they left Woody without a voice  - practically pantomimed - for a handful of cartoons, except for his traditional (dubbed-in) laff from the 40's.

But anyway, back to this box set; it deserves 5 stars for many more reasons than the 1940's Woody cartoons. There are bonus features & documentaries on all three discs - and on the third is an episode of the old Woody Woodpecker Show of the 60's (watch the cartoon-made-for-TV in this episode and you'll witness how the animation suffers). There's a nice handful of bonus toons from Chilly Willy, Andy Panda, Swing Symphonies and more on each disc.

Political incorrectness here? You betcha! That's part of what makes cartoons from the 30's and 40's so great; rather than the sterile-safe humor in recent animation (not to mention some current toons have traded political incorrectness for sexual jokes). Because of the P.I., the box warns that this is a collection for the ADULT collector. That's up for parents to decide; but put your uptightness aside, grab the family and enjoy this WONDERFUL collection of classic Woody - packed with 75 cartoons, more than most toon collections. Have fun!",1185667200,6,1743,4.861952861952862
2815379,5,B000PC1PAW,"Universal Studios has to be commended for their efforts in presenting the ""Woody Woodpecker and Friends"" classic cartoon collection on DVD. This wonderful three disc collection is a tremendous value for fans of all ages and filled with fun extras. The three discs are single sided / dual layer with great packaging and artwork. This collection consists of 25 cartoons per disc and bonus extra's, complete with individual slim cases for storage. The 75 original theatrical cartoons are completely uncut and have been digitally remastered for DVD according to the back of the package. The quality of the video transfer for these cartoons ranges from average to very good.

The cartoons in this amazing collection aren't listed as being completely restored, however the overall quality is definitely better than I had hoped for as a ""Woody Woodpecker"" fan. If you're a fan of this wacked out woodpecker and want to relive the hilarious antics of Woody & his friends again and again, you need to buy this set. They're is a disclaimer on the rear packaging clearly stating that this set is intended for the adult collector and may not be suitable for children. I hope this review was helpful.

I just cracked the seal and have been bouncing around these discs...so far the episodes look good to  great and i  LOVE the bonus footage of Walter Lantz discussing the characters and his history and even teaching how to draw WOODY!!! This is not advertised as RESTORED...but digitally remastered...a subtle wording difference to be sure but a big one in practical terms.  Restoration refers to working on the prints to fix problems and remastered means they've simply been put into the digital domain. These are NOT restored nor do they advertise to be..
This is really the way it should be done from a packaging  standpoint and at a very very good price. It wouldn't have been too many years back when this would have been sold in about 20 Videos....or 10-20 DVDs...or worse Universal ""Flipper"" DVDs!!

The mere selection available on this collection, though, is worth the $35 SRP.  ""Abou Ben Boogie"" and ""Pass the Biscuits Mirandy"" are impossible to find outside of this collection.  While I'd love to give a collection of my favorite 'forgotten' cartoons, I have to take into account the horrible restoration and give this a 3-out-of-5 star rating.",1184371200,8,663,5.045871559633028

The early theatrical high water marks (one featuring the 1948 hit single WOODY WOODPECKER SONG) were highly preferable to later watered down TV toons in which LANTZ was forced to tone down the violence and mayhem. Warmth-seeking penguin CHILLY WILLY and amiable ANDY PANDA rounded out LANTZ' stable of stars (the creator also appeared in informative mini-documentaries about the basics of animation), but WOODY established the pecking order from day one.
