So much story in each episode, so much action!",1255651200,,339,4.666666666666667

3701588,3,B001MVWRMK,"Dead spies coming back from the grave, treacherous allies, shadowy organizations bent on global domination, the rantings of a 15th century scholar that point to the end of the world, lots of gadgetry and gunplay, and a host of would-be arch-villains based in nightclubs.

Yes, it's yet another season of ""Alias"".

(In departing from existing Rotten Review policy, we will NOT have a short squib even hinting the basics of the show - there's so much baggage built up over past seasons, that there's no point to getting into season three unless you've seen 1 & 2.)

LAST SEASON, ON ""ALIAS"": Sydney Bristow has finally vanquished ""The Alliance"", a shadowy organization of rogue agents who manipulate counterintelligence operations for their own agenda.  Just when she thought she was safe, Syd is ambushed by a counter-agent disguised as her best friend.  Though winning the fight, Syd wakes up to find herself in Hong Kong.  Worse, she finds that 2 years have passed - 2 years in which she's been presumed dead.  Dixon is now a CIA director, her father is in jail and, worst of all, Vaughan is married.

THIS SEASON, ON A VERY SPECIAL ""ALIAS"".  While trying to learn the secrets of the past 2 years, Sydney discovers a new sinister organization, ""The Covenant"".  She also finds clues that she may have been turned to their side during the time she went missing, becoming a nearly cybernetic assassin named Julia Thorn.  Syd must learn the truth of her recent past before the CIA does.  Luckily, Syd will have the help of her father (once sprung from Fed. Custody) as well as Marshall & Dixon (now definitely working for the CIA).  She will also have to navigate dangerous waters with Lauren Reed, a fellow agent who (big surprise) is now Vaughan's wife.

WHAT WORKS: Alias is a lot of fun - perhaps the most entertaining show of its kind, especially when you consider just how often it shamelessly recycles the same basic idea (there's something on a computer in a room locked with a biometric key and located in the basement of a nightclub or some fancy building that just happens to be hosting some fancy dress ball).  The fast pace keeps you from recognizing just how much the show recycles itself.  Lots of twists and turns keep you glued, while the writers display an almost superhuman skill at shifting the plot's gears at the perfect moment.

WHAT FAILS: The episodes are perhaps a tad too clever for their own good, creating new enigmas so quickly, that you forget if the older ones were ever satisfactorily resolved.  Also, in changing direction, the show fails to create any compelling characters.  Vaughan's new wife is so cold, and has such a precisely foreign accent, it's almost impossible to believe that she'll turn out to be anything more than a female version of Sark.  Sark is also back, and having seen what David Anders can do on ""Heroes"" it was dispiriting to see how underwritten he is here.  (Are the writers so behind the times to think a foreign accent enough for a baddie?)  The best characters are the oldest ones - Sloane as charming and evil as before, and Jack Bristow as the world's best, worst and most homicidal father.  The worst character is also the linchpin for many of the early episodes - Robert Lindsey as an NSC bigwig determined to break Sydney.  It's a cool role, but Lindsey never becomes more than an oaf, a bully and utter moron - becoming the first character on the show to accidentally kill himself with his own stupidity as the fatal instrument.  ""Alias"" is always short in the Villain department - so many come and go that there's little effort expended to make them genuinely evil or convincingly menacing.  By the end of the season, ""Alias"" has revealed its own identity of being a show running out of ideas.

Luckily the fun of the preceding seasons provides enough steam to at least keep the show going.

I've also read some of the books that went along with the series.  There are some things that I do need to comment upon.  I'd actually like to meet just one person, man or woman who could tolerate the physical beatings delivered in some of these scenes and even act like they were going to get back up and keep fighting.  And of course, the good guys all need to spend some time on the shooting range, because they can't the a bull in the ass with a base fiddle on a good day.  They let loose a 15 shot clip right at the bad guys and miss all of them.  Oh well, it was still entertaining.",1405555200,,711,4.115942028985507

3701659,5,B001MVWRMK,"I believe I never missed an episode when 1st aired on TV and have been waiting a long time for the price to go down on ""Prime"". Now about $11 per series. I watched it mostly because of Jennifer Gardner (beauty and acting) but the other many characters were outstanding and have had or gone on to further success on TV and/or movies. Great plots and twists/turns/tricks. Looking forward to watching it again -- which will be hard given all the wonderful spy/CIA/paranormal/science fiction/etc. series on SyFi, CW22, etc. in past and this year.  I have trouble keeping up AND CAN'T.

By the way -- sign up for Amazon Prime -- even as the price goes up to $99/year. It has over 40,000 movies and TV series and many are free. A discount for those that are not. I'm trying to get my wife to quit Netflix (no need for it anymore).",1402876800,2,824,4.4144736842105265

3701680,4,B001MVWRMK,"Alias was such a great show. They had a great cast of characters and storylines, especially early on. By the fourth/fifth seasons it started going downhill, but the show as a whole was a good one. I wish they made TV shows like this still. For anyone who hasn't seen it, I recommend you do.",1365033600,,290,4.290909090909091
3701681,3,B001MVWRMK,"Despite being labeled as the poorest of the current Alias seasons, this season presented us with some new dynamics, fabulous changes in characters, and several unexpected plot twists. Two years after killing Francie's double in Los Angeles, Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) wakes up in Hong Kong. Everything has changed. Vaughn (Michael Vartan) has gotten married, believing Sydney to have perished in the fire that ravaged her apartment. Will Tippen has gone into Witness Protection. Her father, Jack (Victor Garber), is in prison for associating with Irina Derevko, Sydney's mother and a Russian fugitive from the US. Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) is now an ambassador for peace with a charity organization, having been granted a pardon for his crimes of inhumanity when he helped the CIA bring down the Alliance.

Sydney has no idea where she's been the last two years. The CIA brings her in for debriefing and then puts her on active duty when she pretends to know something about the Covenant, the next wave of worldwide terrorists. Through coercing and threats Sydney manages to have her father released from prison, and he confides to her that he's been investigating into her disappearance. First it was a search for her murderers, but then he came to realize that Sydney was still alive. Her face appeared on the security tape of a Russian diplomat that was murdered several months before in cold blood. Sydney has no recollection of the action and is desperate to learn the truth. In the meantime she must contend with her feelings of resentment toward Vaughn for moving on with his life. When his wife Lauren Reed (Melissa George) comes to work in Sydney's office as a liaison between inner agencies, the sparks fly.

The woman are distinctly unfavorable toward one another but through a series of events possible friendship begins. They must fight on the same side to reach a positive conclusion as the CIA is caught up in a battle to the death with the Covenant, who continue their search for the artifacts of Milo Rambaldi, a seventeenth century mystic. With the release of British assassin Julian Sark (David Anders) the stakes get higher, the game gets dirtier, and the spies get more brutal. Within the Covenant loyalties are divided, possibilities are endless, and it's not guaranteed everyone will live to the End Game. Sloane may not be trustworthy. Lauren is hiding some secrets. Vaughn must deal with having two women in his life that he loves, and Jack is out to protect his daughter at all costs, even if it means misleading the US government. Sydney just wants to know the truth, and when it's found, what can be done with it. The season suffered from poor ratings due to ABC pre-empting half the season for television specials, but will do well on DVD.

All of the episodes are well written and intense, following in the tradition of ""wicked cool spy gadgets"" we've come to expect. It was nice to see tech Marshall at his finest, full of witty puns, clumsy attempts to interest others in his life, and all of his neat little spy tricks. Sydney continues to be a worthwhile heroine, but sadly Vaughn takes a darker turn in the second half. Events lead him to compromise mortal integrity due to a previous deception. Jack encourages him in this practice, leading him down the same dark road that removed Jack's sense of ethics. I'm sorry for this, since it fails to allow viewers to empathize with him. Justice must always be served, but revenge is nothing to aspire to, particularly taking delight in another person's suffering. Watching Vaughn torture people for information is both brutal and sickening. It's always been the distinction between good and evil on the show -- the bad guys torture, the good guys employ other tactics. It's a change not necessarily for the better.

The violence is fairly mainstream for the show but has gotten bloodier: when people are shot, blood spurts from the wound. Primary characters executed in the second season are shown being killed in slow motion flashbacks. A man has his throat cut. People are punched, kicked in the face, stabbed, shot, thrown through windows, set on fire, and die in explosions. The most gruesome events involve a woman stabbing two silver chopsticks through a man's hands, nailing them to the table in an intimidation tactic, and a decomposing severed hand found in a box in the desert. Sydney goes through restoration therapy and has paranormal dreams of cutting into a cake and having blood spill forth, then discovering that she's cutting through a man's hand. In this dream sequence she encounters Lauren, who attempts to strangle her with plastic. The tables are turned and she kills Lauren instead. During a high-profile rescue attempt evidence must be produced of physical abuse and Sydney is asked to brutalize Lauren just enough to avert suspicion. It's not the first nor the last time the two women exchange blows.

Sydney is strapped to a table and injected with memory-inducing drugs. We watch her being electrocuted and tortured several times. Vaughn abuses both a female spy and Sark for information, employing various cruel tactics. Language this time around is mild, some profanities, numerous accounts of ""son of a..."" and a few mild abuses of deity. Modern vulgar terms like ""screwed"" and ""suck"" are mentioned. Sexual content is less of a problem in this season, but does carry implications in early episodes. Marshall's girlfriend is pregnant. He wants to get married, she wants to maintain her independence. Everyone winds up with at least one night stand before the end, but only ""waking up the next morning"" is shown: Sydney and Will, Sark and Allison, Sloane and his therapist, Sark and another spy, etc. Early on Sydney goes undercover and has to pretend to seduce a thief in order to gain information. They kiss suggestively for awhile, and she winds up with her shirt off before he turns on her. Sydney and Vaughn are forced to change clothes in an elevator, and turn away from each other (her bare back is shown). Some sexual remarks are made -- a man tries to enrage Jack by implying that her daughter is the wildest thing he ever had in bed. One episode also features a hazy nude silhouette of Sydney through a shower screen.

One of Sark's female associates uses her wiles to lure a man into a death trap. They neck and grope (he slides his hand up her leg to her hip) before she stabs him in the heart. Turned on by a narrow escape in a later episode, she finally gives in to Sark. They're shown passionately rolling around on a bed (and partially undressing) before the scene cuts out. Several times women are shown changing clothes, one purposefully remaining in her undergarments while a male spy is in the dressing room. There's an element of adultery involved, although Sydney and Vaughn never go beyond a tortured kiss or two. Thematic elements involve mass bombings and threats, kidnapped children of CIA operatives, and family turmoil when Jack and Sydney learn a dark secret. Each episode might not contain the intense cliffhanger we've become formerly accustomed to, but it's a solid season that answers a lot of questions and leaves us with many more. Fans of the show will be thrilled, and newcomers enthralled.",1363824000,,7241,4.863857374392221

3701709,4,B001MVWRMK,"***This review may contain spoilers, if you have not seen through season 3 of Alias and do not wish to know of plot points up to that point I recommend that you stop reading now!***

Alias was never a massive hit, but it did respectable numbers. During its first season it carried approximately 9.7 million viewers. The second season saw a slight drop down to an average of 9 million viewers per episode. The critical acclaim, steady numbers, devoted cult following, and ABC's want to turn the series into a bigger success led to Alias gaining a coveted spot airing after Super Bowl XXVII. The result is that Alias obtained the biggest numbers it would see during its run with an audience of 17.3 million viewers. Unfortunately, it only retained 19% of the Super Bowl viewers and it would be noted as the lowest rating ever for a post-Super Bowl show since 1987.

Despite the low numbers (which most likely had more to do with how dense the mythology of the show can be rather than quality) the post-Super Bowl episode was critically acclaimed, and marked something of a reboot for the series. With ""Phase One"" we watched as the underground criminal organization SD-6 was taken down and Sidney became a full-fledged CIA agent. Will Tippin started working as an analyst after being ostracized for a drug addiction SD-6 framed him for, and Sidney and Michael Vaughn are now able to bring their relationship full circle. But as we saw with the season 2 finale, this was just an appetizer.

Sidney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) wakes up in the middle of Shanghai wondering how she ended up there after her fight with `fake' Francie (Merrin Dungey). After contacting the CIA Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan) finds her in Shanghai and tells her that she's been missing for two years. Furthermore, Vaughn has quit the CIA and is married, Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) is in hiding, and Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin) has been pardoned by the government and is now known to the world as a humanitarian and philanthropist. Now Sidney must find out what happened during her two lost years and try to take down another organization, The Covenant, who may be responsible for her disappearance.

There's an interesting subtext to the third season of Alias. Naturally, this season having been released during the 2003-2004 season, there is a subplot dealing with government agencies wielding large sums of unchecked power. Much like what we've seen in the ""War on Terror"" from 2001 to present, the agency NSC (National Security Council) in Alias uses illegal interrogation techniques and holds prisoners for unlimited amounts of time without representation. While the previous seasons dealt more with social commentary, this season delves a little more into political commentary without being pushy or preachy as some shows often do.

That's not to say that the social context is thrown out the window. The relationships between the characters are as tortured and complex as ever. Sidney's relationship with Sloane becomes complicated by the fact that she wants him dead and the NSC and CIA need him. Add that to the fact that now Sloane is working as a mole for the CIA within The Covenant and Sidney is his handler, echoing Sidney's work as a mole within Sloane's SD-6. Jack Bristow continues trying to build his relationship while walking a gray line to protect her at all costs. The most complicated relationship once again becomes the relationship between Sidney and Michael as they maintain their love for each other but are unable to act on it. There's also an interesting plot later in the season dealing with a missing daughter who might be the key to a Rambaldi riddle.

Once again I find myself pleasantly surprised by the acting. Jennifer Garner always surprises me with her chops in this series, making the audience feel her emotions and empathize with her. I lament the lack of Bradley Cooper in the series, but his absence works within the narrative, especially considering the new characters added to the series. Melissa George plays Vaughn's wife, and as Sidney's ""sparring"" partner she does a great job keeping up. Kurt Fuller oozes duplicity as the head of the NSC, something he always specializes in. There are also some brilliant cameos with bit parts from director David Cronenberg (Eastern Promises), Griffin Dunne (After Hours), Justin Theroux (American Psycho), Richard Roundtree (Shaft), and Ricky Gervais (The Office) among others. Alias is a smorgasbord of great performances.

Even as we delve deeper into the mythology of Alias the focus remains on the human story, which is why what Abrams has created works so well. I have to admit that I do miss some of the elements of the previous seasons. Sidney no longer has a personal life outside of the people she knows at the CIA as she did in season one, and the agencies that represented a threat previously have completely gone to the wayside even though they were previously on the Rambaldi path as well. If anything, though, this show has done something special and risks have been taken in switching up the formula that most shows wouldn't normally take.

4.5/5

3701711,5,B001MVWRMK,"This season of Alias is probably the best one in my opinon. The only reason it is different then the last two seasons is because they advance the story in a big way. There is a new big bad,Vaughn is married,Marshall is haveing a baby and Jack is locked up. You find all of this out in the first episode. The twists are insane,Jack is better than ever and Weiss gets alot more screen time. This season in very entertaining,Pretty much everything is wraped up in the finale,And it does a good job at leaving good cliffhangers to carry you into season 4. The cliffhanger in the last scene doesn't tell you much,But enough to make you wonder just what the hell is going on now. Sydney can't catch a break to save her life. Great season and hope season 4 is better. I'm getting it now!",1323129600,,780,4.312925170068027

Jennifer Garner and Victor Garber do some of their best acting in this Season.",1474761600,,362,4.761904761904762
