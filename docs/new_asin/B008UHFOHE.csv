8530539,5,B008UHFOHE,YOU JUST NEED A MODERN  PROGRESSIVE SCAN DVD PLAYER. THE OTHER COMMENT UNDER MINE SAID HIS DVD PLAYER DID NOT READ 7 DISK. WELL I BET HE HAD A OLDER DVD PLAYER. HE SAID HE IS A TEACHER. I BET A CHEAP DVD PLAYER OR OLD. I AM USING A SONY PROGRESSIVE SCAN DVD PLAYER. READS  ON DEMAND MOVIES FINE. BUT HE IS RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING. THEY DID PUT PARTS OF THE SHOW ON WRONG LABLES BUT THERE ALL THERE.,1395360000,2,396,3.876543209876543
8530540,1,B008UHFOHE,"The set came in and only one out of eight DVDs worked. The one DVD that worked was mislabeled, claiming to be season two disc two, when it was season one disc one. I understand that this is 'produce on demand' but apparently their methods of production are less than effective. You'd think that someone in quality control would have noticed that NONE of the discs worked.

I am very disappointed, because I needed these for a class I am teaching that covers several included legends. Instead I had to use the few available on YouTube, which isn't all of them, and a real hassle.

The series itself is interesting, but buying it this way is not reliable at all.",1350950400,4,660,4.491666666666666
