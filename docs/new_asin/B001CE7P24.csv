3511471,5,B001CE7P24,"My grandson loves Harry the Bunny!  His first visit to Nana's house I had to get the DVD.  It was perfect, as soon as he got fussy we turned it on and he went crazy, settled down and off to sleep!  We took many pictures and video's of him watching Harry because his (my grandson's) facial expressions were priceless!",1305417600,,316,4.322033898305085
3511472,5,B001CE7P24,"Perfect! Just Perfect! Brings me a lot of peace!!! When my baby is full of energy, bored, noisy, whatever, when she is driving me crazy and I have a lot of things to do or just wanna rest a minute, all I have to do is play Baby's First TV DVD to her. We were travelling by car and she got very stressed after a while so we played the DVD and she were ok for the rest of the travel, it was a bless!",1286928000,,397,3.6823529411764704
3511473,5,B001CE7P24,"My 14 month old son hates being in the car.  We tried everything before going with a Video player for Long car rides, both my parents and wife's parents live 4 hours away.  Harry the bunny is a favorite of my son, so now when he sees the car the first thing he wants is Harry the Bunny.  Honestly worth every penny and then some if your son or daughter like the show.  Lasts about 45 min and teaches some good developmental concepts, on/off, in front/back that sort of stuff.  Highly recommended.",1250208000,,496,4.3478260869565215
3511474,5,B001CE7P24,"Harry the Bunny keeps a smile on Landon's face the entire time he
is watching him.  I call him my funny little bunny!  He just loves
the music, the colors and of course Harry talking to him.  We play
along with Harry.  Highly recommend this to all Mom's and Grandmothers!",1231804800,,271,4.36
3511475,4,B001CE7P24,"This is my son's favorite video.  He is 15 months and always brings this to me to play.  He chooses this over Elmo, Cookie Monster, Mickey Mouse...everything.  They do repeat the intro for each segment but it is abbreviated so it is tolerable for us.  I wish they sold other Harry the Bunny merchandise.",1230336000,,303,4.555555555555555
3511476,1,B001CE7P24,I thought my child was going to love this dvd because she loves to watches in Baby First TV but when the made the dvd the play the same music constantly and gets to be annoying. I would not recommend it as a dvd.,1228176000,,212,3.840909090909091
3511497,5,B001CE7P24,My baby granddaughter's love Harry The Bunny.  It's simple and fun!  A good learning tool.,1410652800,,90,4.933333333333334
3511498,5,B001CE7P24,WE LOVE Harry the Bunny here. My now 2 year old has loved Harry since she was a baby. The running time is good and the price is great for the what you are getting.,1381968000,,163,3.6857142857142855
3511499,5,B001CE7P24,"My grandbaby gives Harry 5 stars.  She loves to watch both the TV clips on BabyTV and now this DVD.  She can be playing with the BabyTV in the back ground.  When HTB theme music comes on she snaps her attention to the screen and is enthralled with the clip.  These DVDs can be used to help teach her developmental appropriate skills.  It makes her happy, when used with adult interaction helps to build communication and cognitive skills.  Never would I recommend using TV/DVS's as a babysitting tool, but for a learning treat that delights the youngster, why not?",1359158400,,564,4.646464646464646
3511500,5,B001CE7P24,"This is a wonderful, wholesome show, and very baby-friendly.  My son is 14 months old, and I limit his television watching as much as possible, but when I need 10- or 30-minute distraction while doing housework, this is the perfect show.  This show teaches simple concepts slowly in small, digestible bites that could be easily understood by a 1-year-old, and my kid never feels overwhelmed by what's happening.  He's not ready yet for the more popular shows like Yo Gabba Gabba, Barney, or even Sesame Street, where more things seem to be happening at once or the concepts are too evolved for the little one.  Parents might get bored easily by some of the repetition that goes on, but this is for the little ones, not for adults.  More engaged parents can talk along with Harry the Bunny by repeating some of the things he says, there are enough pauses in the character's dialogues for a parent to chime in without interrupting, which can help a baby understand what's happening.

The price online is unreasonable, but that's perhaps due to a very limited supply.  You can watch this show for free if you have Netflix streaming.",1354752000,,1129,4.729591836734694
3511501,4,B001CE7P24,"The show itself doesn't seem as long as the dvd says, some advertising in the beginning that is pointless if your child is only interested in Harry but it has lots of Harry which is whats important!",1347926400,,198,4.378378378378378
3511502,2,B001CE7P24,"I have to admit, my daughter loves Harry the Bunny, so we watch it.  However, EVERY SINGLE EPISODE involves some sort of chomping, slurping, annoying giggling, and of course the awful music.  I don't know why she likes it so much, but I genuinely wish I had never put it on for her, because now I have to watch it when she does.  I cringe every time he sees a carrot (or anything) to eat, or something to drink, because he has to slurp and smack his lips for a solid 30 seconds each time.  It drives me crazy!! The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is because of my daughter.  Oh, what we will put up with out of love for our children.  :/

In short, I do not recommend this show to anyone, ever.",1339891200,4,709,4.057553956834532
3511503,5,B001CE7P24,I ordered this for my one year old nephew.  He loves it.  Keeps him entertained in the morning after breakfast when everyone else is still sleeping. Highly recommend.,1338336000,,166,4.892857142857143
3511504,5,B001CE7P24,Our Grandson was thrilled with the DVD and it was just what we expected at a fair price and shipped promptly.,1312329600,,109,4.238095238095238
3511505,4,B001CE7P24,"My 2 year old LOVES this movie. She'll talk back to him and play peek-a-boo. It keeps her entertained. This is great! However, this is perhaps the most annoying, obnoxious kids show from my perspective! I don't know what's worse, crying or Harry. 4 stars because the kid loves it and it keeps her happy.",1307232000,4,303,4.527272727272727
3511506,5,B001CE7P24,My oldest daughter used to love watching Harry the Bunny and now my youngest daughter is also a fan. The DVD is perfect for popping it in to get a little bit of time without worrying about the shows changing to something inappropriate.

8287330,3,B001CE7P24,DVD works good but the box was clearly a recycle and the front image a reprint that didn't fit the case correctly. Would buy again for my own childs use but not as a gift for someone.,1507766400,,183,3.972972972972973
