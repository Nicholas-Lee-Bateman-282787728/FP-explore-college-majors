6282295,4,B00INCBASS,"I'd compare this moview to the first ones from ""Bourne Supremacy"". Good story and action. The fighting and chasing scenes are pretty original. Highly recommended for 2 full hours stuck to the couch.",1406419200,,198,5.03030303030303
6282296,5,B00INCBASS,"WOW!!! This movie did not disappoint. Plenty of action, great story, and, as always with Gong Yoo, great acting! You have no idea what is coming next, there are plenty of twists and turns. I hate nothing more than a predictable movie, and this was anything but that!",1406419200,,266,4.5625
6282297,5,B00INCBASS,"this was a great movie to watch. think 'the fugitive' and 'the bourne series' wrapped in 1 movie.  great action throughout, very worth ur time and money!",1406160000,,153,4.666666666666667
6282298,4,B00INCBASS,"A Korean thriller based on North Korean escapees and the South Korean counter-intelligence agents who manage them.  The movie starts out in a seemingly straightforward fashion with Dong-Chul, an ex-North Korean Special Force soldier who is searching for a former colleague who betrayed him.  When Dong-Chul is framed for murder, a former colonel at Defense Security Command is brought in to chase after him.  He has an ax to grind as he was demoted after a run-in with Dong-Chul.  However, as he probes deeper, he begins to uncover layers after layers of conspiracy and betrayal.  Tightly crafted action thriller with well-acted human elements to keep us rooting for the good guys.",1406073600,,681,5.099099099099099
6282299,5,B00INCBASS,"So before I watched this movie I did a quick review search online.  Most of the reviews I came across said things like, good movie but a little to long, or it would have been better if it was shorter.  I completely disagree.  I was turned on to this movie by a Korean friend of mine after mentioning how much I really liked Man from Nowhere (totally and completely worth the watch, available on Amazon Instant).

SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!

This movie is about a N. Korean special ops soldier who defected to the South after the regime change from Jung Il to Jung Un and the loss of his wife and child who had also defected to China.  While in S. Korea Gong Yoo's character is a driver for another N. Korea defector and wealthy chairman.  When the chairman is killed Gong Yoo is framed.  This starts a nation wide man hunt for him and the revelation of several pivotal details not only about the murders he is being blamed for but the work of the chairman and the real story behind his wife and daughters death.

The movie takes great care to reveal truths and plot line in a consistent manner so you do not feel like you are getting it to fast or slow.  It uses innuendo and nuance to promote a hidden story under the action packed intensity that I think was done with great skill.  It is a little long but does not feel long when you are watching it.  Surprisingly, or not so surprisingly when you think of the character he plays, Gong Yoo did very little speaking in this role.  I have always loved his acting (watch the Kdrama Coffee Prince, incredible skills this man has) but this role was very different the what I am used to for this romantic comedy king.  He pulls it off well and gives us a lovely bonus in the form of shirtlessness!

The supporting characters are colorful and the frenemy role of the S. Korean spy hunter was cast to perfection.  There is some good on screen chemistry that makes the action packed story entertaining and even insightful.  I would recommend this movie to Korean movie watchers, action/thriller junkies, martial arts lovers, and people just looking for a really good story to get into.",1399766400,35,2122,4.441860465116279
6282300,5,B00INCBASS,"Wow.  Intricate story line.  Excellent action scenes, without an over emphasis on blood and guts (but yes, lots of killing).  Very interesting take on 'loyalties'.  I rented this because of the star, Gong Yoo, but I would watch this again to catch all the details that I'm sure that I missed and I would recommend it to others.",1488672000,2,327,4.586206896551724

6282307,5,B00INCBASS,"Inspired by the Bourne films in story and the Bond films in essence, but not so much that you can call it a knockoff, The Suspect brings Finding Mr. Destiny and The Crucible star Gong Yoo and frenetic spy action to the big screen in Korea as never before. It has its faults in plot and certain executions, but it can be overlooked and overshadowed by its action, acting and quick jolts at every turn. That said, a perfect 5 star rating for acting, and obvious hard hard work training the actors (particularly star Gong Yoo, who did not use a stunt double for ANY scene, from Systema fight scenes to the epic car chases...admirable for the star usually noted for his work in romantic comedies and dramas), and managing set pieces.
In the backdrop, amidst a murder investigation, is the strained relationship between North and South Korea, and the morally strained lives of the defectors to the South, much more eloquently handled here than in say, Commitment, which did not execute its plot or background very well, or The Berlin File, which, though entertaining, was at times way too over the top with set pieces. The cast worked their way through their roles, certain roles written a bit corny for some tastes, sometimes too overdone, but it's negligible; the actors and actresses played the hand they were dealt properly. The camera work, yes shaky, but clear and obvious that it's always Gong Yoo (sometimes a stunt double is noticeable for other actors, only if the screen is paused), and not as nausea inducing at all like the Bourne films.
I personally hate voice dubs on foreign movies, but to those who prefer dubbing over subtitles, do not let the fact it is subtitled and not dubbed in English deter you from this buy, The Suspect is well worth your money.

The Blu-Ray arrived timely, but the outer protective case that slides on and off was a bit tattered. The disc case itself was in perfect untouched condition and the disc as well, so thankfully if it was improperly handled in transit, the outer case absorbed any shock. The quality, as you can expect, is very crisp and clean, and the movie itself, for any Gong Yoo or Korean movie fan, is a must have for collectibles.",1467676800,,2186,4.648578811369509

and now it is in my collection. it is almost 2 hours long but I think it moves pretty fast and still exciting to watch. of course

6282314,5,B00INCBASS,One of the best car chase scenes (better than Popeye in the French Connection) and not a dull minute.  I have vivid memories of Korea and several locations used were a real pleasure to see again after so many years; the steps were hard enough to walk up and down and shooting a car chase was a real gem.  The acting was top notch; Korean movies are giving Hollywood a run for the money and I will spend my money gladly to watch movies as good as this.,1454371200,3,451,4.113636363636363

If you watched and liked Jason Borne and the raid series and are a fan of spy thriller movies this will not disappoint. It is by no means perfect but time flew by and for me keeping up with all the twists and turns was the only difficult part.

6282322,2,B00INCBASS,There's a lot of great Korean movies out there including the ones that do what Hollywood blockbusters do just as well. For me this isn't one of them.

6282338,4,B00INCBASS,"Meet Ji Dong Cheol (Yoo Gong) he is the best spy that those pesky North Koreans had. Then whilst out on a mission - and they really do carry out some bizarre missions including abductions etc., he returns home to find he has been betrayed by the country he was serving.

He gets to the South and finds work for an important Chairman of a company with shady dealings. The Chairman is murdered and Ji Dong is framed for the job. But also the Chairman gives him a final gift of a [air of spectacles and tells him to bury them. He then has to clear his name work out what the specs are all about and sort out his own internal demons.

This is a full on action fest with proper car chases and enough cars getting totalled to make a scarp dealers convention happy. There is loads of fist fighting and gun play but where this really scores is how it is all pulled together. The camera work is first class, there is no CGI and boy does it look better for it. The acting is great too, but you do get some exaggerated performances, but that is how it is done sometimes in Asian cinema. For Korean film fans there is a great reference to `Sympathy for Mr Vengeance' which was a nice touch and gives you some idea where they were aiming here. There are a few plot holes too but they are entirely forgivable in the context of just how good, entertaining and edge of the set it is. Simply a rollicking roller coaster of a film.",1422662400,6,1413,4.1911764705882355

6282341,5,B00INCBASS,"Yeppers, I love my Asian cinema movies and this Korean addition is no different, I love it. Wall to wall action and 99% of the time a wonderful story. Gong Yoo is the very misunderstood hero of the piece Don-Jul who was abandoned by his own in North Korea during a mission and then learned about his daughter being killed and goes on a vengeance rampage. He is wrongly accused of assassinating the ""Chairman"" not sure who that is but I digress, non stop action and fight scenes that are off the charts and God knows you are pulling for this silent hero all the way. He doesn't say much but he is a fine actor who gets the point across. Once again, another fine movie to come from the far east and one I'm sure some Hollywood hack will steal and ruin. The whole supporting cast including the cop who is in pursuit is wonderful.",1420848000,3,826,4.301282051282051

6282346,3,B00INCBASS,"This movie was okay. While some of the action scenes were fun to watch, others felt labored and too long.

Overall, I would rate the movie 6/10.

As background, I believe S Korean movies have really been impressive over the last several years. The Man from Nowhere was an impressive piece of work all around, just to name one example.

When I saw the positive reviews for The Suspect, I thought I would be in for a treat. I came out disappointed. While the movie was slightly better than average in my opinion, it was too long for my tastes. And as I noted, many scenes were dragged out for too long.

Also, while I am able to suspend realism for two hours to enjoy a movie, I found certain scenes silly. For instance, a team of shooters with automatic rifles could not shoot a man, who ran 50 yards on unobstructed rooftops. Really?

The film had high quality production, and was better than average, but I felt I wasted over 2 hours of my life watching it. And I generally love action movies. And I couldn't help but feel that this was a Bourne knockoff (in style at least), which relied on fast camera work during hand to hand combat scenes, which can have a dizziying effect.

While many seem to enjoy this movie, I would not recommend this movie to friends. If you must see it, do not go in with too high of expectations.",1418428800,,1326,4.348178137651822

6282349,5,B00INCBASS,"Really enjoyed this movie! Shipping was fast, DVD came un-damaged.
I will say that when I first tried to play the movie on my laptop (Mac), it would not work, and I was afraid something was wrong with the disc. I tried it on a different computer, then again on the Mac, and it's now working fine. Not sure what the problem was.

The movie itself was non-stop action with an intricate plot. Sometimes it was a little hard to follow with everything going on and all the different characters, but I soon caught up. There is some heavy language throughout. The action scenes were intense; they kept me on the edge of my seat. I really enjoyed the ending as well - I was afraid for a little while that they would leave it hanging, but they gave enough to leave me satisfied. Gong Yoo is definitely one of my favorite Korean actors, and he didn't fail to impress. 5/5 stars.",1417392000,2,868,4.3580246913580245

He was passionate and the movie keep you on suspense with twists. The only thing I have to complain about is the directing. At certain scenes, I was confused because of the shaky camera or the inexperience shooting style of action movies made it hard to follow and I wasn't sure who was throwing the punch. Other than that, very good movie! I took a risk buying the dvd without ever seeing it first. I just knew I love Gong Yoo so I had to get it!

6282355,4,B00INCBASS,"To some viewers, a 2013 Korean action thriller The Suspect (Yong-eui-ja) may look a bit like a Jason Bourne movie, though our protagonist is not amnesic here. Ji Dong-cheol (Yoo Gong), a former spy wrongly accused of murder, runs and fights like Matt Damons character in this fast-paced, non-stop action.

Yoo Gong is Ji Dong-cheol, a former special agent of North Korea, who defected to the South. Now he works for a CEO of a big South Korean company, but when his employer is killed, Ji Dong-cheol suddenly becomes the No. 1 suspect of the case.

The story itself is not really unique. Action sequences are intense, especially the car chase scenes, though editing is often too fast, leaving the viewers to wonder what is going on. Despite several flaws including these things and all too familiar plot devices, The Suspect remains entertaining throughout, thanks to the slick direction and strong acting from the cast.",1413849600,,920,4.929032258064516
