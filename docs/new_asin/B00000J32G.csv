It's not meant for the materialistic bound audience.
If you find this dvd unappealing you're just blind as a bat.",1266364800,2,181,5.066666666666666
7911899,1,B00000J32G,"I thought this was really going to be about the Maya.  Instead, this is newagey/primitive gobbledygoot.  If you want to chant and stare at the chrystal and worship ancient Osiris, then this is for you.  Otherwise, you won't like this dribble.  He wastes the first five minutes chanting.  Lectures are more interesting when you actually attend them.  They are more tedious when seeing them recorded.  If you want to howl at the moon, you might like this.  If you wanted a serious archaeological or anthropological discussion, you will be extremely disappointed here.",1250726400,9,565,5.065217391304348
