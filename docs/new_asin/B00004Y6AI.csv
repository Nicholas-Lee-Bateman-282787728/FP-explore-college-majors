7926642,5,B00004Y6AI,"I actually purchased this tape while I was still ""in shape"", but on a full-time student budget and too broke to maintain a gym membership.  I started using it again after gaining 60 lbs during my pregnancy, but I remembered what a great time I had and the great results I saw, albeit more than 30 days.  What woke me up instantly with Donna's workout was that the morning after, I actually felt the familiar ""effective workout"" burn that comes from a gym aerobics class!  That was my first clue.  The second clue was that I wasn't watching the clock on the VCR wondering when all of this would be over...I was having a lot of fun figuring out the steps, and Donna's conversation throughout the tape is friendly, encouraging and above all, sincere.  Unlike that breathy, fake voice we usually hear...Anyway, the toning part is great!  On mornings when I don't have time to bounce around for the cardio, I combine the toning from this video with her toning from ""30 Days to Firmer Abs & Arms"" and I feel like I'm on my way to looking like I did in my college days.  Donna is truly a best-kept secret in the Aerobics market -- buy this tape and spread the word!  She's GREAT!",1043366400,9,1172,4.4186046511627906
7926643,3,B00004Y6AI,"I have been searching for a workout for so long now that would help me tone my legs without adding so much mass...well this video definitly toned my legs, adding 2 inches to my thighs..I cant fit in my jeans now! The aerobic part of it is a lot of confusing jumping around.  I tried it twice, and now I just do the toning part...I combine this video with quick callanetics hips/behind....I must say the toning part is actually 'fun', and I enjoyed it...but i want a leaner look.  I have been dieting also, so its not like ive been pigging out and wandering why the hell i got bigger thighs....If you are serious about losing weight, and creating a leaner look, TRY Body Flex by Greer Childs...I lost 40 lbs over the course of 3 -4 months doing this...Now im down to a weight that my body enjoys...but i do not...I still want to lose.",1037145600,4,833,4.333333333333333
7926644,5,B00004Y6AI,This video gives you a great workout. The moves are easy to follow and you have fun working out. Donna helps you forget about the time. I enjoy all of Donna's videos. Keep up the good work. P.S. the foot movements are great.,1025481600,3,224,4.232558139534884
7926645,5,B00004Y6AI,I bought this video like a month ago and I've been doing it 3-4 days each week and I have seen already alot of results! I lost 2 pounds off this video in 1 week!! 1 WEEK!! I deffinitely urge everyone to purchase this video !,1016323200,7,224,3.891304347826087
7926646,5,B00004Y6AI,"Wow! This video is great! It was a great change of pace.  I had been doing the ""of steel 2000 platinum series videos"" and the aerobics just weren't making me feel it anymore.  I tried this because I liked Donna as an instructor.  I'm glad I did! I am seeing more results now and it's only been a week.  I just needed that little kick to get my heart pumping again. The steps are easy to follow and the toning is different from the norm and it's great!  I like the kicks and balancing work.  FUN!",992390400,,495,4.104166666666667
7926647,4,B00004Y6AI,"I love this workout.  The aerobics are challenging, but not too difficult to pick up after a few times, and the toning really works.  It just tends to get boring when done as much as necessary to see results.",992044800,2,208,4.3076923076923075
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
7926649,1,B00004Y6AI,don't buy this I bought this video and it has lots of foot work but most of the time you can't see what's going on and what to do with your feet and they go way too fast.  The people in this video also have BIG thighs so  there's proof enough that it doesn't work!,948672000,7,264,3.7818181818181817
