379062,1,630193055X,"The Favorite (""Intimate Power"") is based on the novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sultana/dp/0380685027/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sultana</a>; which itself is loosely based on the legend of Aime du Buc de Rivry.  Aimee was a French Heiress living in Martinique whose story would most likely have been forgotten in the annals of history, save for the fact that she was the cousin of Josphine de Beauharnais (Napoleon's first &  much maligned wife).

There have been many fictionalized re-tellings of what happened to Aimee;  who, sometime around 1779, at the age of eleven, vanished without  trace at sea on while making the return trip home from convent school.  The most persistent of these tales has it that her ship was attacked by Barbary corsairs, who upon seeing Aimee, decided she would be a  highly valuable asset to trade.  From there,  the story varies- she was either sold at the slave market, or gifted  as a concubine for the harem of the Sultan, Abdul Hamid I.  Somehow, once there, Aimee manages to distinguish herself from the hundreds of other concubines vying to get the Sultan's attention, and ultimately (depending on which story you're reading) gave birth to, or became the adoptive mother to, a deceased concubine's child, Mahmud II.  When Abdul dies and Mahmud becomes Sultan, Aimee- who now goes by the name Nakidil- becomes Valide Sultan by proxy (A sort of queen mother, who runs the harem, and is fairly powerful in her own right).

That is the short version of the story- though I should note,  no substantial evidence has ever been found to support this theory.  What really happened to Aimee is unknown- the ship could have simply sank.  The Harem theory's foundation rests on the fact that the real Nakidil Valide Sultan was in fact, very Western-mannered, and French influenced.  During her tenure, she taught her husband French, initiated reforms within the harem that gave the concubines a slightly more liberated existence, and for the first time, Constantinople sent a permanent envoy to Paris, to serve as ambassador.

""The Favorite""  rolls with the urban legend of Aimee, but unfortunately, it falls flat.
It was released in 1989, so some of the blame comes down to being dated, but there are too many other problems to make this mess of a movie cohesive enough to be enjoyable.

Aimee's abduction, and her eventual rise as the Sultan's favorite under the tutelage of Tulip (Kzlar Aas; chief eunuch, played by Ron Dortch) is turned into a comedy of sorts, but a poor one.  This is a shame, b/c the  Kzlar Aas was a fairly powerful man, and could make or a break a concubine's future.  The relationship between him and the favorite would have been a complex and mutually successful one.  Here, though, Tulip is turned into a caricature of sorts,  who Aimee pokes fun at, in regards to his lack of manhood; downplaying the reality of the Kzlar Aas's importance and influence.

Amber O'Shae portrays Aimee as a petulant, immature, and far too liberated drama queen. Undoubtedly, the real Aimee (renamed Nakidil) would have seemed scandalous to the Ottomans,  given her Western upbringing.  But even by 18th century French standards, Aimee would have seemed far more repressed than Amber O'Shea plays her.

The harems were not a forgiving place.  Any concubine with a modicum of intelligence or will to live  would have quickly learned to keep her mouth shut and to behave appropriately, or suffer the consequences.  The consequences, by the way, often involved being tied up in a burlap sack, weighted down with rocks, and thrown into the river.  Above survival was the chance for recognition or some semblance of love from the Sultan.  Most concubines would spend their entire lives within the walls of the harem, unseen and untouched by anyone outside it.  The only men permitted to come in and out of the harem were eunuchs and the Sultan himself.  The biggest opportunity a concubine had was to be given the opportunity to please said Sultan sexually for a single night.  They would give him the performance of their life, all in the hopes that he would call on them again, or at least impregnate them on that one night.  This was the only way to rise through the ranks- to be a favorite, or bear a son- the two of which were intricately intertwined.

In the film, however, Aimee ignores this once in a lifetime chance, turning down the sultan.  She stomps petulantly through the streets, out of the harem, when she feels like it, when in reality, this would have been an impossible feat (not to mention deadly one).  When she finally concedes to a night with the sultan, he tells her that it was her choice to sleep with him or not.

Wait- er, what?

A man who, for all intents and purposes, had hundreds of women kidnapped, in order to lock them up in a harem for his pleasure,  until they died?  I don't know about you, but this guy doesn't strike me as the ""no means no"" type.  Irregardless, Aimee eventually does sleep with him, dethroning his former favorite in the process (a scary cougar who is constantly scheming to get rid of Aimee; even going so far as to murder one of Aimee and the Sultan's  children- which ultimately gets her tossed in the river- although Amber's Aimee doesn't seem to broken up about the loss of the child).

Even as the favorite, she is still obnoxious and unlikable.  The real Nakidil of history managed to implement more liberating rules for the other concubines, and to help the Sultan with political issues that were designed to better the lives of others.  In the movie however, there is nothing of the strong, intelligent, & graceful woman Nakidil really was- instead, the movie Aimee spends her time scheming and flitting from one self-serving agenda to another.  What's worse, all her tantrums, narcissism and power plays are not only portrayed as tolerated, but eventually ""loved"" as part of her ""spirited personality"".  This for me, was the greatest stretch- and completely sacrilege in the face of the real Nakidil's efforts.

Obviously, to the Western mind, Harem life sucks, whether you rise through the ranks or not- so for me, the real Nakidil is duly impressive, given her ability to overlook her dire and presumably undesirable existance- someone stong and full of moxie, and depth, who made lemonaid from the proverbial lemons.  It's believable that some of the non-conformist characteristics a Western woman would have had could have seemed unusually exotic & intriguing to a sultan who only ever met obsequious women that obeyed his every command.  But there was just no semblance of the real woman in the movie version.

Outside of the acting, the costumes were cheap and historically inaccurate.  Sets were hokey,  there was absolutely no comprehension of the intricacies of Ottoman culture (which instead, is made into a mockery), or even  of an 18th century french woman.  Again, some can be blamed on the film being dated, but all in all, it's low budget, sensationalized pulp fiction, and a bad bit of it at that.

This left me with a real sense of loss, when one considers the magnitude of opportunity the setting alone presented- opulent harems, Topkap Palace, bustling cities of concentric architecture, massive domes and mosques; a myriad of colorful murals in tile, vivid under the blazing sun.  The inner baths of the Harem, and the ethereal and gauzy costumes of it's inhabitants.  A veritable melting pot of gorgeous women;  long-legged denizens stolen, sold, or gifted to the Sultan, from every corner of the world, all gathered in one place, each with their own story to tell.

While I am in no way trying to downplay the hardships of Harem women, that kind of material for a movie alone is gold; add to it a spirited, beautiful, French-Creole heiress who is abducted by  pirates on the high sea, thrown into a pit of scheming women, & goes on to climb to the top, enrapturing a Sultan on sheer wits, and then mobilizing him to enact changes that liberate her predecessors?  How can you possibly fail to make something remotely entertaining (or even just aesthetically stunning) with all that?

The good news is, there have been literally hundreds of novels about Aimee; so if you are just hungry for more on her, you'll find no shortage.  The bad news is, most of them are either seriously dated, or fall more into the bodice-ripper genre than historical fiction.

379130,5,630193055X,"Though this movie is a low budget film which could have been improved upon with a little imagination, I still gave it five stars due to the fact that harem movies are very difficult to come by, and this is, by far, one of the best I've seen.

She is bought by the Turkish Sultan where she soon learns the do's and don'ts of harem life, and what she must do to survive, and rise to power. Costumes are quite lovely at times, and scenery also.
I personally do love the movie, and would never part with it, having said that, if you have first read the book it was based upon ""Sultana"" by ""Prince Michael of Greece"", you will be greatly disappointed as the movie barely resembles it.
