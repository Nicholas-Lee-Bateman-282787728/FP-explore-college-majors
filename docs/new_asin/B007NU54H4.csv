5100237,5,B007NU54H4,"About halfway through this movie I looked over my 8 year old daughter, and almost 12 year old son, to my husband and said, ""I can't believe I'm getting goosebumps from a Tinker Bell movie.""

Yes. Goosebumps.

My daughter and I have watched all the Tinker Bell movies in the franchise, and have even watched the specials on the Disney channel. I have to say that we've loved all the movies, but I think Secret of the Wings is now my favorite.

I won't bore you with the synopsis, as you can read it above, but I will tell you about what we liked,

-New characters!! Not only do we get to see all the favorites, we get lots of brand new characters as well, including Periwinkle (of course), Dewey (the Keeper), Lord Milori (voiced by Timothy Dalton! Yes!), and a host of new friends from the Winter Woods.

-No bad guys. I realized when I was watching this that there are no bad guys in a Tinker Bell movie! There are bad things that happen (and an occasional stray cat), but there is really no one bad guy. I love that! I love that it teaches my daughter that bad things can happen but if you work together, and think outside the box (like Tink), you can solve almost any problem.

-Personal sacrifice. As one of the other reviewers here remarked, there is a moment of personal sacrifice made by Tinker Bell that truly makes the film. It shows that while her main focus is getting to know Periwinkle, she cares more about all of the fairies, and the great pixie dust tree, than her own wishes.

-Great music. I'm still singing...""and the great divide...doesn't seem so wide..."" although I do miss the Celtic music from the previous movies.

-The story! How can I put this last? The story is FANTASTIC. Simple enough that children can understand it, and complex enough that adults will enjoy it (note: my husband and I were going ""Ooooh - I know what's gonna happen"" as there is quite a bit of foreshadowing, but it didn't ruin the movie at all!""

All in all, the entire family has marked this as one of the best Tinker Bell movies yet! Even the animation is getting better (the bobcat looks so real!).

Thanks, Disney, for making an amazing franchise - so...when's the next movie?!",1350172800,122,2180,4.454773869346734
5100238,5,B007NU54H4,"I was able to review this movie last night with the kids and all I can say is that it was an amazing film. The artists at Disney have re-created a beautiful world for the fairies and have introduced a brand new set of fairy friends into the mix. I loved the concept of the movie. I also loved the change from Winter to Summer that was shown in the movie. Tinker Bell shows great sacrifice in the movie, not only for herself, but also for all of Pixie Hollow. This sacrifice provides a great example of what it means to be family and a member of a community. I can say that the whole family thoroughly enjoyed watching this film and I already know that we will be watching it again and again in the months and years to come!",1349827200,46,723,4.134751773049645

5100240,5,B007NU54H4,"We saw this movie at the El Capitan theater in Los Angeles this past weekend (9/9/12).  It was very enjoyable, and my 5 year old daughter and her friend were mesmerized.  I really enjoyed it myself as well.  Looking forward to this movie coming out on DVD!",1347235200,28,256,4.404255319148936
5100241,5,B007NU54H4,"I saw this movie with my new children on September 2012 at El Capitan in Los Angeles (a special showing).  My three year-old daughter and my five year-old son sat there mesmerized for the duration of the whole movie.  This movie has a beautiful story-line and wonderful execution.  If Disney had touched up the scenery (""background"") a little more, it could have easily been ready for theaters.  Even as is, the winter scenery is well done.  I actually think this movie might be my favorite of the four tinkerbell movies (and I have watched each of them several times with my kids).
The story includes a beautiful moment of personal sacrifice by Tinkerbell.  She ""gives up"" something she values greatly to save those she loves (I cannot reveal details without spoiler alert).  What a wonderful lesson for young ones!  I would recommend this highly to any parent with a young son or daughter.",1346803200,122,891,4.777777777777778

5100261,4,B007NU54H4,"In the totalitarian world of Fairy Land low caste fairies such as tinkers and dust mongers are condemned at birth to work out their days in Dickensian assembly lines while high caste fairies frolic in the meadows or whatever.  But below the lowly tinker fairies are an untouchable caste called the winter fairies, forbidden to even socialize with the upper castes. When Tinker Bell learns that her long-lost twin, Periwinkle, is cursed to remain forever in the barren wastes of Winter Land she builds an elaborate device allowing the cold-blooded winter fairy to survive in warmer climes.  However her forbidden act of race-mixing is soon uncovered and her device destroyed.  This leads to an act of eco-terrorism causing all of Fairy Land to be hit with a devastating snowpocalypse!  Fortunately the Winter Fairies are able to save the plants and trees of Fairy Land from freezing, by um... freezing them first?  Or something.  Thus Fairy Land is saved and Tinker Bell reunited with her twin!  Oh and Tinker Bell's broken wing is fixed by a Christm- I mean Unspecified Winter Holiday Miracle!  Yay for the power of friendship!

OK, all snark aside this was a charming little cartoon for the 3-5 year old set.  My girls absolutely loved it and seemed to follow the story pretty well.  As usual their tiny little attention spans gave out a bit before the end but they liked what they sat still for.

The music is meh, generic uplifting pop, and I'd rank it behind Pirate Fairy but it was still pretty good.  As with most Disney films there's a disturbing message there about obey your betters, conform and stick to your own kind.  Sure in the end Tinker Bell is united with her sister, but she almost kills herself, her sister and all of Fairy Land in the attempt.

So yeah, get it for kids, especially if you have two young sisters, this will get them right in the heartstrings, it's no classic but it's good.",1482105600,,1909,4.6906906906906904

5100279,4,B007NU54H4,"Secret of the Wings is a 2012 computer-animated fantasy film, and the fourth in the Disney Fairies franchise, produced by DisneyToon Studios.  It is the last to make use of the theme of seasons in the franchise as well (the 5th and 6th entries to the series, The Pirate Fairy and Legend of the NeverBeast respectively, do away with focusing on a single season/ climate).

This one was built upon a budget of $35-million (which is right on par with the budgets of all the entries in the series) and even with a limited theatrical run, managed to turn that into $67,537,798 through the international box office.

Coming in at 75-minutes in length, the cast is virtually unchanged from the prior movies.  The story here tells of a forbidden zone to the warm fairies like Tink called the Winter Woods, which just so happens to be inhabited by winter fairies.

Ever the explorer, Tinkerbell wanders into the winter woods where, in addition to discovering the strange shimmering affect the cold seems to have on her wings, she meets a frost fairy named Periwinkle.

Together they work to uncover the secret of their shimmering wings while trying to unite the warm fairies and the winter fairies once and for all.

The pacing, visuals, charm and gags are nothing new here; and its a very safe conclusion that fans of any of the other entries in this franchise will appreciate this one as well.  While I wouldnt go quite as far as to say this one is the strongest entry to the Disney Fairies universe, it is certainly a step up in terms of story telling over the three films that preceded it.

When one thinks of a winter-themed CG piece, often the first reaction is to imagine a world of bleak white and gray but this is Disney after all.  While Frozen is in no danger of being shown up, these guys prove they're very adept at animating ice, gently falling snow, cozy fabrics and dramatic sweeping shots that encapsulate the chill perfectly.

New addition winter overseer Lord Milori makes for a very interesting character reminiscent of something out of JRR Tokleins playbook (voiced by Timothy Dalton).

Perusing various critical opinions around the net seems to reveal the common word sweet to describe the viewing experience and frankly, thats a fitting adjective.  The film doesnt take many chances or try to tweak with the proven formula but rather approaches the mythos with a good, steady hand and a singular plot twist that adds a new dimension to the canon of Tinkerbell.

All in all, Disney has proven that its quite serious about the franchise (with six feature films and a pair of shorts out to date) and consumers are responding to their commitment with their wallets.  This is actually the first of the series to have made a profit at the box office, a trend that has continued with the films since.",1469145600,,2807,4.688391038696538

5100326,5,B007NU54H4,"DVD simply has Disney Secret of the Wings. Tinkerbell is not in title. Very well rendered, top quality all throughout. Has a very simple story of cooperation and curiosity. Some of the ideas in this film were later used in Frozen, and Periwinkle somewhat resembles Elsa of Frozen. Uses of frost and ice in this film also cropped up in Frozen. One thing that was pointed out elsewhere is the prohibition of going to Winterland makes no sense as Winter fairies were shown in the first Tinkerbell movie, so a continuity error is in this film. Also the Winter Lord visits Tinkerbell up high on a giant frozen mushroom, yet he cannot fly. Neverthe less, I enjoyed this film very much. The idea of the joined wings creating a supernatural light and able to repair Tinkerbell's broken wing was very intriguing. The two librarians (one in warm Pixie Hollow, the other in Winterland) was another inspired idea of parallel complementary worlds. Some parts are too cute for an adult, such as a discussion about clothes, but it is a film an adult can enjoy as well as small children. Tinkerbell is always very inventive and innovative, creating remarkable machines -- one of the reasons I like her, she is a great engineer ready to produce a device as needed, such as a snow-making machine. The theme of two divided worlds coming together to help another is a lesson learned for the need for cooperation and tolerance.
  One problem is that the other fairies haven't enough to do and have few lines. It was only occasionally an ensemble piece, with each character doing a little bit, but with the major roles confined to Tinkerbell and Periwinkle. A rather short film, but very well done, especially in showing the movements of the face and body, all flowing realistically. Also Tinkerbell is a brave fairy to go out to a frozen world like that, an explorer and engineer. A great hero for all.",1445644800,,1881,4.696969696969697

5100370,5,B007NU54H4,"The Tinkerbell/DisneyFairies off-shoot franchise is, to me, one of those unexpected pleasures.  To be honest, a lot of these Disney spin-off movies/tv-series weren't very impressive and at times quite underwhelming to me.  Over time, I just learned to basically ignore their existence.  However, one breakfast, I randomly turned on the TV and low and behold there was a tv presentation of ""The Great Fairy Rescue"".  Though it's title doesn't sound like much, it's story, themes, depth, character development, etc. truly entranced me.  Since then, Tinkerbell films have stayed on my radar...including this one...""Secret of the Wings""....an enjoyable ride that can move the hearts of child and adult, alike.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Alright, this is a film aimed for young girls (but turns out it can appeal to all).  There's really nothing offensive and particularly troubling in it.  The most offensive thing I can think of (and I'm grasping at air for this) is that the clothes are sometimes low-cut and a mid-riff shows...but really, there's a difference with this ""low-cut"" versus typical ""modern/urban low-cut"".  Point is, it's squeaky clean.

TO THE MOVIE...ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS
Themes:
Each of the Tinkerbell films contains a central theme for which a story is built upon.  In the past, they tackled issues such as facing your destiny, broken families, and belief.  This film is no exception.  Without giving too much away, it explores themes about the bond of family and how good intentions can turn bad...and that bad decisions aren't always made by bad people, but people that truly love and care. As far as the themes go, what I loved about it was how well it had developed theme and ""showed rather than told"".  I am especially partial to how they highlighted the importance of family.  I come from a close-knit family, so it really resonated with me.

What I loved about the story:
Though ""The Great Fairy Rescue"" will always be my definitive ""Tink film"" because the themes that surrounded it were ones that were particularly close to me, this film is brilliant and shines well right beside it.
1.  The first thing that amazed me how was how much content they could stuff into a film while still keeping a solid pacing and maintaining a sense of completeness by the end.  Not only do they introduce tons more lore about ""fairy-ology"", but they add a whole new land with it's own unique culture that is both distinct yet ironically similar to the ""warm fairies"".

2.  In similar lines to the above, I was rather pleased with the storytelling, as well.  The pacing was good and smooth, the story itself was intriguing and sparked interest.  I especially appreciated that they took time to focus on the characters' emotions, as well.  Especially in relation to the main conflict, you can feel that there was something deeper in it.  I also loved that they did not forget the previous films, neither, but made reference to them.  There were also tons of heartwarming moments that both young and old can share together.  And of course, the ending was very sweet and a nice way to tie the whole film together.

3.  The visuals are simply beautiful and awe-inspiring in their own right.  That and the cinematics and visual choreograpy...expecially during the ""Operation: Periwinkle"" segment and the finale.

4.  They get huge brownie points for this...if any of you ever felt shivers in the climactic finale to the old Will Smith/Bill Pullman/Jeff Goldblum film, ""Independence Day""; you can expect similar, here.

Extras:
There's honestly not much...but what is there is decent...well one in particular.  If you get the blu-ray edition, not only does it include  two music videos (which, as music videos go, you'll either like 'em or not), but there's a short called ""Fright Light"" which was cute but forgettable.  Still, the biggie is the inclusion of the ""Pixie Hollow Games"" 23-minute special episode.  It's a surprisingly moving 23-minutes that is inspiringly and emotionally stirring...you Rosetta fans will love this one for sure.  On the bright side, it does mean you don't have to buy that episode separately, anymore ^_^

ALL IN ALL:
The Disney Fairy films have become one unexpected gem of inspiration, magic, and, at times, thought provoking material...something absent in a lot of Disney's non-major installments recently.  And ""Secret of the Wings"" is a more than welcome edition that can leave you feeling not only hopeful, but ready to take on the world.",1433462400,,4467,4.993234100135318

5100524,5,B007NU54H4,"Definitely the best Tinker Bell movie in my opinion.  It feels a little short but it is fast paced and fun. It introduces a completely new world in the winter woods and the animation is absolutely beautiful. (Quality that can challenge big budget, theater-released animated movies) I highly suggest choosing the blu-ray if you are planning on buying, it's worth it!  The only problem I have with the plot is that it is inconsistent with the previous movies, in which the winter fairies are seen in Pixie Hollow often and the opening scene showing Tinker Bell's creation was obviously only one seed, not two, but it's a children's movie and it doesn't even matter if you've never seen the other movies.  I also love looking at it in my movie collection. the Blu ray packaging is bright, sparkly and extremely girly. It is definitely the most eye-catching movie I have.",1408579200,,867,4.766666666666667

Disney really has a good series here and the Tinkerbell characters continue to entertain (with the exception of one unnecessarily dopey winter fairy character in this one; why they need a new-age stoner character is beyond me.)

The artists at Disney have re-created a beautiful world for the fairies and have introduced a brand new set of fairy friends into the mix. I loved the concept of the movie. I also loved the change from Winter to Summer that was shown in the movie. Tinker Bell shows great sacrifice in the movie, not only for herself, but also for all of Pixie Hollow. This sacrifice provides a great example of what it means to be family and a member of a community. I can say that the whole family thoroughly enjoyed watching this film and I already know that we will be watching it again and again in the months and years to come!",1395878400,,734,4.097222222222222

5100629,4,B007NU54H4,"Ok, I normally think any newer 3D type of movies that Disney puts out to make more money tends to be a crap movie. BUT this one is actually quite good and I really do like it. It's a kids' movie, but it's still a genuinely good movie. This whole new franchise has actually grown on me to like it. I think it's a good movie franchise and now little girls and boys everywhere can dress up as a fairy. There are boy fairies in this series too, it's not just for girls, but it's mainly aimed at little girls.

The 3D isn't horrible, it's actually well done and pretty. The characters aren't bland or that annoying, some are, but it's mostly okay. I have a feeling the people at Disney used some Pixar people to make the background environments look better and the character design/animation as well.

Great movie for kids and people who like these kinds of movies. I think the director and screen writer made the characters easily identifiable with a younger audience because they're fairies but also with adults as well since the adults would probably be watching it with their kids and they don't want the parents to be that bored either. The characters have depth, and complexities that you would find in other Disney movies that isn't just aimed at a younger audience. I think they're stepping up their game into making a movie or set of movies to be better than just sub par.",1389052800,2,1376,4.47808764940239

5100662,5,B007NU54H4,My daughter can't watch this video enough.  She has to watch it everyday to go to sleep. Def worth buying,1380672000,,105,4.25
5100663,5,B007NU54H4,"First, I have to comment on the sellers. This product came very well packaged. There was no room for shipping damage. Originally it was to be sent ground, but the sellers upgraded it to first class. I only had to wait a day. Along with it came a personalized 'thank you' with a coupon for future purchases. It was very nice to be thanked for business and given a little incentive to buy from them again. I was very impressed. It was brand-new and much cheaper than retail cost.

Secondly, the movie; it is really a great movie. I have an 8 year old daughter and a 6 year old step-daughter. Both girls are still getting used to not being only children, so sharing is a chore. We bought this movie for our step-daughter's birthday as something the girls could enjoy together and we have enjoyed it as a family. The 3-D version is very cool! I also like the story-line. It is a heart-warming story about sisters and how they stop at nothing to be together despite the odds. They fight because they love each other and teach others that anything can be overcome.

I would recommend this movie to anyone with little girls. Aside from being a fantastic fairytale, the messages in the fairy movies promoting lessons and friendships are wonderful to share!",1380672000,,1248,4.542222222222223
5100664,5,B007NU54H4,Gave this as a Christmas gift to my nieces. They love it! Wish I had gotten a chance to watch it myself. Maybe one day.,1380585600,,119,3.8
5100665,5,B007NU54H4,"This was great when a girl at our work brought her daughter with her one day. She's a great little girl and so well behaved but I could see she was getting bored with coloring. I had my Kindle there, so I ordered this up and let her watch it. She was thrilled!",1380585600,,260,3.9245283018867925
5100666,5,B007NU54H4,Have a list of the dvd's the girls want - this was at the top.  So - when I saw the price ordered it immediately.  Arrived quickly and don't even want to think how many times we have watched it.  Very pleased.,1380585600,,209,3.9285714285714284
5100667,5,B007NU54H4,"the tinkerbell series is one of the best disney series ever in my opinion. there are never bad guys in their movies, just good people resolving conflicts with each other. that is so refreshing of a change from the typical good guy/evil guy plots of old.

i've owned and watched all 4 movies with my kids and this was one of the most touching. a wonderful story of friendship and adventure and overcome challenges together. I hope disney never stops this series. it is rare to see a sequel outdo the priors but tinkerbell continues to amaze me.

buy it! you won't regret it.

Note i bought the deluxe set with downloadable movie to ipad. it works pretty well and easily loads up on itunes. my kids now borrow my ipad regularly and probably use it more than me. a wonderful educational tool by the way if used correctly and monitored carefully. loaded movies are key for road trips and long plane trips.

Also note, the deluxe set (3D blu-ray/DVD) also comes with pixie hollow games on the DVD as bonus. that is an excellent short movie that my kids like watching as much as secret of the wings.",1380326400,,1093,4.477386934673367

I was a little upset considering how much I paid for it. The other DVD I ordered from them  had no problems. With this DVD, it was very noticeable that the case was unable to hold the DVD into place as I was unable to put it back into its holding spot.",1380067200,,396,3.7710843373493974

Nice for on the plane and at grandma's.
Movie plot is a little better than previous 'adventures'.
There is more 'emotion' in this movie- rather than silliness.
My daughter (4) got caught-up in the movie and REALLY likes it.
This movie is better than the previous 'ho-hum' movies, IMHO.

One of the hidden messages symbolizes to be that of unity due to scenes showing various members from Winterworld and Tinker Bell's world working together in certain scenes.

The thing I like about Tinker bell movies is that most Disney movies will usually have at least one or more (adult) scary moments (WALLE, CARS and Toy Story 2 and a couple of others maybe the exceptions), but movies like finding nemo, Monsters inc, Alladdin, Lion King etc...although being amazing films and classic films I find I am always being asked to fast forward through certain sections of these movies by my kids. Tinker Bell movies do not have any of these adult scary moments, so because my girls are 2 and 4 these movies work great and can leave them to watch without worrying about them being scared about something they might see. I do believe as parents we have a responsibility to not expose certain things to our kids when they are too young.",1368835200,,900,4.363095238095238

5100742,4,B007NU54H4,"In ""Secret of the Wings"" Tinker Bell (Mae Whitman) crosses the bridge to the Winter Woods, where she meets her ""sister,"" a winter fairy named Periwinkle (Lucy Hale). But it is against the rules for fairies to cross the border, and Tinker Bell learns the reason when her act of kindness leads to unexpected consequences.

Disney's fourth Tinker Bell movie ""Secret of the Wings"" is a great family picture that benefits from superb voice performances and colorful animation. The story is simple and engaging, but not too simple so that adult audiences too can enjoy it. It is also good to see Queen Clarion (Anjelica Huston) again.

Part of the franchise's charm is the vivid and lively descriptions of life in Pixie Hollow, which is fun to see, and this time again you will not be disappointed. The film's amusing hospital and library sequences are something you should not miss.

My only complaint is that the film could have spent more time on supporting fairies. Also, ""Tinker Bell"" is no longer in the title. Why is it?",1365811200,,1021,4.757062146892656

It is definitely the best of the series. The subplot is complex for adults but the main plot is easy to follow for kids. Adults could enjoy the love story while kids enjoyed the fun. I have to say, this one is a tear-jerker. It is a truly touching story. I like that this was a decent cartoon without all the innuendos and rude humor of so many kids movies nowadays. This seems like it would be an amazing flick for split-families. So touching! Love this one! Love it!",1364774400,,614,4.301724137931035

5100770,4,B007NU54H4,"I absolutely loved this film so much, particularly how they re-visited the moment of Tink's birth. that I had to go back I re-watch the original Tinkerbell movie. When I did, however, I saw some glaring & contradictory flaws that I had to point out. Without getting into any spoilers, one of the major plot points of Secret of the Wings is that Winter Fairies cannot cross the border into the warmer seasons of Spring & Fall without ending up like Mr. Freeze without his suit, & that the ""Warm Fairies"" are no better off in Winter. However in Tinkerbell, there were several Winter Fairies present at Tink's birth, & she was even tested to see if she would be one of them (which, of course, she wasn't.) Additionally, as part of her introductory tour, Clank & Bobble take her through the Winter Woods. Now it may be argued that the part of the Pixie Dust Tree where the Winter Fairies were sitting may have been climate controlled to host them comfortably & that Tink and her guides only skirted the edge of the Winter Woods & didn't stay there long, but that doesn't explain how the Minister of Winter (who was not the ""Lord"" shown in Secret of the Wings) was able to take a tour of the preparations to bring Spring to the mainland without so much as breaking a sweat. The main reason I'm brining this up it that when you tell a story that's part of a series, you can't introduce contradictory elements in new installments without explaining why. Regardless, younger viewers are likely to be too engrossed in the film to notice things like that, & it is a great story despite its problems. I recommend it, but with hopes that Disney will be more careful in the future.",1363910400,,1668,4.490131578947368

I love how the films teaches about unity and making things work between both sides. It's almost like a Romeo and Juliet except that there's no discrimination here. It was just about two fairies trying to find a way that the fairies from Pixie Hollow and Winter Woods could be together without having to regard about their safety. I really enjoy the bond between Tinkerbell and her lost sister Periwinkle and how they would look out for each other. The animation was really beautiful and pleasantly done. Slush is really a cutie. I have definitely fallen in love with the new characters in this story. They are just so darn cute!!! I would have definitely watch this again. I even rank this film higher than the recent Disney animated films like Tangled and the newer Barbie films. IMO, this movie just outshines them with their story plot, character development, and animation combined.",1362700800,,1010,4.810344827586207

I LOVED Tinkerbell and the Lost Treasure for it's messages of a) bad things can happen when you lose your temper and b) your brain and not magic can solve your problems.  This movie, however, is mostly magic.  I think there was a real missed opportunity at the end to have Tinkerbell live with the results of her decision and thus be able to go live with her sister.  Would have made a powerful ending but it's a Disney movie so magic rules.  And it could have had a little more about fairy activities and climate change and jet streams - through a little science in with the movie and they wouldn't even notice.

This movie has no villains -- the fairy sister are kept apart ""for their own safety.""  It is also surprisingly enjoyable movie and it has a lot of charming scenes your kids will enjoy.

5100896,5,B007NU54H4,My daughter loves any Disney movie and this is now one of her favorites. We all love Disney and Tinkerbell.,1358812800,,107,4.4
5100897,5,B007NU54H4,"As a parent, I watch every movie that I can with my child because I want to know what she's watching as well as what she likes and what she doesn't. When my daughter said she wanted this movie I thought to myself ""Oh great, another Tinkerbell movie...bleh"" but I decided to get it for her anyway as Disney and Pixar are usually on par with quality animated movies. I am very delighted to say that I wasn't disappointed.

In this installment, Tinker Bell's endless curiosity (I'm sure that's part of the Tinkerer in her) decides that she wants to explore the winter woods after an interesting situation goes down with her wings glowing at the warm/cold line while she's helping her animal fairy friend escort some animals to the winter side of things. Unfortunately, with Tinker Bell being from a warmer climate, her wings are far too delicate to travel in the cold without them breaking and her never being able to fly again. Sadly, there is no cure to fix them if they break. To combat that tiny problem, Tinker Bell builds a winter outfit and wraps herself, as well as her wings, in it to prevent damage/breakage and sets off on her journey to discover...why did the cold weather make my wings glow, sparkle, and twinkle?

During the course of her winter woods exploration, Tinker Bell discovers that she has a twin sister (Periwinkle) that lives in the winter woods as a frost fairy and that they have identical wings. When they get close to each other their wings glow, sparkle, and twinkle. Is it magic? You bet. Do they know why? Not a clue. Regardless, the two spend lots of time together in the winter woods letting Tinker Bell enjoy all the winter activities before they hatch a plan to take Periwinkle to the summer area partake of all the things the warmer climate has to offer. After-all, if Tinkerbell can survive in the winter woods, why can't they figure out a way to keep Periwinkle alive long enough to smell the flowers?

Tinker Bell enlists the help of her 2 tinker fairy friends and they build a contraption to grate ice into snow that Periwinkle can fly around in and stay nice and cold. The only problem is, they didn't get a big enough block of ice and Periwinkle almost loses her wings. This of course gets Lord Milori, the Ruler of the Winter Woods, and Queen Clarion, warm area ruler, involved and you find out exactly how everyone knows that there's no fix for broken wings. Tinker Bell and Periwinkle are told that they can't see each other anymore, which as you can imagine upsets them both a lot. During the course of all of this the ice grater that made the snow for Periwinkle gets pushed into the stream that is the definitive line of the warm/cold areas and starts a freeze epidemic of massive proportions that begins to overtake the warm area and threatens to kill the magical pixie dust tree in Pixie Hollow. Did I mention that if the Pixie Dust tree dies then no fairy will ever fly ever again? Yeah, heavy stuff.

This was, to me, the most definitive moment in the movie as far as Tinker Bell's character is concerned and it makes her totally worthy of the fact that my daughter wants to grow up and be her (I wanted to be a ninja, I try not to hate on dreams). Tinker Bell decides that regardless of the fact that it will ruin her wings and probably totally limit her life, she is going to fly to the winter woods and enlist their help to stop the deep freeze from killing everything. Huge sacrifice for the greater good of all fairy-dom. Because Periwinkle is a frost fairy, she and the rest of her frost fairy friends can cover the tree in a layer of frost that will preserve the tree from being destroyed by the ice. Go team go.

When it's all said and done Tinker Bell and Periwinkle save the day, Pixie Hollow, AND even find a way to let warm fairies spend time in the winter woods. Oh, they also figure out how to mend Tinker Bell's broken wing.  It's a win - win situation.

In conclusion, this is a good movie, it has some good moral values and fiber in there and it's actually entertaining enough to keep this 28 year old mom's interest. I recommend this movie.",1358812800,,4109,4.441644562334218

This story about friendship is eye catching and fun for kids but filled with subtle learning opportunities.  My daughter was very happy to tell her friends that frost protects plants from deeper freezes and somehow managed to learn that water freezes into snow and frost and snow and ice melt to water.  Of course now she wants a Periwinkle dress and the usual assortment of tie in merchandise.",1358640000,,524,4.865168539325842

As a dad, I found it mildly entertaining. I don't think it was the strongest movie of the Fairy franchise, but over all it had a good plot, some emotionally pulling moments, and lacked the typical Disney kill off of a mom.

 I would recommend this movie to other parents of fairly loving girls.",1358035200,,438,4.317073170731708

5100939,5,B007NU54H4,This movie is very entertaining for all ages.  Tinkerbell has a lot of spunk.  Her sister Periwinkle is the sweetest character you would enjoy on film.  The entire family should watch this together.,1357948800,,198,4.9393939393939394

But this is a watchable flick for all you adults out there forced to relinquish the remote to the short, loud beings that share your home.

I found this movie to be charming. Good story line, Nice characters, and a great ending.
I am certain the Keeper is my favorite.

I think parents won't mind watching this with their little ones.",1357948800,,357,4.085714285714285

5100961,5,B007NU54H4,"I like when films have some story that does not goes precisely where one would expect. In this magical history, Tinker Bell will be presented as a found character and so, a new story more based on new stuff and new characters can be introduced softly. My daughter and I loved this film and I think most of children will do too.",1357776000,,327,4.290322580645161

5100968,5,B007NU54H4,This movie is the 3rd or 4th tinkerbell made. It shows a lot of neat scenery with winter and also some summery scenes but mostly wintertime. And again shows the meaning of friendships.  My 4 year old son loves the movie too.  I love all of the Tinkerbell movies.,1357689600,,262,4.326530612244898

5100972,4,B007NU54H4,"My family began watching these movies several years ago for my daughter. We, as parents, prefer the strong-mindedness and individuality of Tink over the assortment of princess movies Disney churns out. The first installment, the origin of Tinker Bell, was well done, and we especially loved the depth to which the creators have fleshed out her world. The second and third installments were also fun: full of adventure, humor, and lessons for the younger audience. In this latest addition, the characterization of Tinker Bell branches out even further by given her a sibling and introducing us to another facet of Pixie Hollow: the winter woods.

I can't stress this enough: as the dad of a daughter, I love Tink's inventiveness and creativity. She doesn't give up, she's helpful, and she's courageous. That's a ""role model"" that girls growing up on Disney have lacked for generations.

PS. I gave it a 4 because it's a cartoon movie for kids. 5's are for The Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction, and any movie with a superhero in it.",1357689600,,1032,4.925287356321839

5100975,5,B007NU54H4,I really enjoy watching all of the Tinkerbell movies with my niece. I'm surprised some of these movies don't go to the theaters but actually kind of glad since it would take even longer to watch them.,1357689600,,200,4.4324324324324325
5100976,4,B007NU54H4,A wonderful Move as usual to expect for a Disney movie. I would recomend this to anyone that is a movie watcher.,1357689600,,112,4.136363636363637

5100979,5,B007NU54H4,It was a gift to my grandchildren and they loved it.  It was worth the money.  When you have 10 grandchildren it nice to find things that they like.,1357603200,,148,4.068965517241379
5100980,5,B007NU54H4,"We love the Tinkerbell movies almost as much as our daughter does.  We like them because they all have good moral messages in them.  Tink's bad behavior is never rewarded, and she always learns her lesson.  This movie seemed lighter and less ""deep"" than the previous stories, but the moral was just as good and obvious.  It is : Rules exist for a reason, and breaking them will likely have consequences.

Alongside this interwoven message is another delightfully fun and beautifully rendered fairy story about sisters separated at birth.  It's very cute.  Mother and Father-approved, and our daughter was mad for it as always.",1357603200,,626,4.961538461538462

5101035,4,B007NU54H4,"If you're considering buying Secret of the Wings, there's a good chance you have already seen the first three Tinkerbell movies. This one is a very good entry and fits right in with the others in terms of quality (the second movie, Lost Treasure, is the only dud in the series). The film features fun new characters and big revelations. Megan Hilty (of Broadway and ""Smash"") has replaced Kristen Chenoweth (of ""Pushing Daisies"" and general awesomeness) as Rosetta, which is not very noticeable even if it is a step down. Angelica Houston as Queen Clarion is more featured in this entry, which is nice.

I have the DVD/Blu Ray combo pack. The TV special ""Pixie Hollow Games"" is included on both my DVD and Blu-Ray disc special features, so I'd assume you'd get it if you bought just the DVD edition. Pixie Hollow Games is 22 minutes and features Rosetta, though Tinkerbell also has a small role. I don't have a 3D player and don't know if it's on the 3D disc.",1357084800,,958,4.569767441860465

5101052,5,B007NU54H4,"Five minutes in and my kids were in love. Secret of the Wings is the best Disney Fairies product yet!

The film opens with the fairies preparing for winter season. In her typical fashion, Tinkerbell cannot be help but curious about what life is like in the Winter Woods. This sends her down a path of rule breaking that is Tinkerbell's signature. Throughout the trouble, she learns a big secret... the Secret of the Wings. I am not one to drop spoilers, so I will leave it there.

This is an excellent short movie that should appeal to both boys and girls. There is no 'villain', so the story is able to unfold without scaring little ones. Also, the addition of the Pixie Hollow games is a nice addition to the package. Quality on Blu Ray is typical of Disney and looks amazing. Outside of the volume being a bit low, it is hard to complain about the quality.

Score another win for the Disney Fairies franchise.",1356912000,,912,4.449101796407185

I don't hear or see any subliminal messages in these like I do in some other children's movies. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it talked about having a boyfriend in one part (which I believe is encouraged way too early, considering the age group that usually watches these). Overall, it's a great family movie! Even my husband didn't mind it!",1356739200,,532,4.2772277227722775

Right up there with a blu ray movie.",1356652800,,120,4.0
5101092,3,B007NU54H4,"Maybe I need to watch it again...
Santa just brought this long-awaited new Tinkerbell installment the other day, and we finally had the first viewing this afternoon.
It's got some great aspects: we all loved learning that Tinkerbell has a sister, and getting a chance to see more of the Winter Land was very cool.
But it seemed to lack something the others didn't - a solid storyline.  We (4 yr. old and 7 yr. old savvy girls) kept waiting to get into it, then suddenly without warning it was over.  Huh?  That was it??
Like I said, maybe we have to watch it again, but there's something to be said about first impressions.
I was very surprised to see how many people gave it the max amount of stars.  Maybe they were targeted previewers hand-picked by Disney??
All in all it was not an unenjoyable movie  - but I feel like it was definitely lacking in basic story structure, depth and detail.  Plus, it was SO short.  It felt incomplete.  If you compare it with the last Tinkerbell movie, these are two productions on opposite ends of the spectrum.  The Great Fairy Rescue was longer, richer, and followed a basic story structure (Dramatic Arc?) with a solid beginning (rising action), climax, resolution (falling action), ending (denouement) .  This latest has almost none of that.  Kind of a shame after their three other fantastic movies for children that are so refreshingly free of needless violence.",1356652800,,1406,4.697959183673469

5101095,5,B007NU54H4,"Who knew Tink had a twin sister?  I think Disney is missing out by not releasing the Tinkerbell movies to the big screen.

5101104,5,B007NU54H4,"This movie makes me happy! I bought this for my 3 yr old niece for Christmas, but I secretely watched the 3D movie with my BF on his 3D TV prior to giving her the original version for XMAS. She doesn't have a 3D TV, nor understand the concept of 3D since she is only 3 years old anyways. It came with 4 discs, so I figured why not :) My BF and I have started up quite a collection of 3D digital cartoons ever since he purchased his TV, and this one by far has had the best 3D effects. With Tinkerbell's sparkling wings, and the shimmering of the fairy's outfits, and the cute little forest creatures, it was all that a girl (at any age) would love! My boyfriend loved the 3D effects, and I think he truly enjoyed the actual movie and storyline as well. (Although he would never rave to his buddies about the Tinkerbell movie that he recentely watched! ;) I know this, because after the movie he made a comment about he appreciated the fact this was the first Disney movie he watched that did not possess one ""bad"" character, and he was absolutely right! With all Disney movies there is always good guy vs bad guy, but this one didn't have that kind of storyline and it was very refreshing to see. I recommend this movie to any person at any age regardless of 3D or not! The 3D version is a BONUS, but either way it's great!!",1356566400,4,1324,4.196078431372549

Unfortunately, the quality of the discs is sub-par. I can't speak for the Blu-Ray discs, as we don't actually own a blu-ray player, but the DVD skipped seven times right out of the box. Luckily, the digital copy is perfectly fine, and the skipping itself was slight instead of jarring.

Not at all scary for a little kid, no violence, just a nice little story.  Personally I could have gone without watching the movie, but it wasn't made for me!

Not to mention the beautiful artwork and animation, the great storyline and dialogue, and the decent to good musical score. I usually end up disappointed or angry about kids' movies because they're either lame on all fronts, gross (excessive potty humor), or way too scary for anyone 14 and under. This is entirely the opposite! We will watch this one again and again.

I've never seen another series of children's animated movies continue to improve the way the Tinker Bell franchise has done. I have loved each movie, but 'Wings' is the very best. The characters and their world continue to expand and deepen. Pixie Hollow is heading toward the immersive levels of Hogwarts and Middle Earth, but for a younger audience.

5101144,5,B007NU54H4,"The Movie (Plot, Characters, Music, Etc.): I was skeptical when the first Tinker Bell movie was released, but since then my 4 year old daughter and almost 2 year old son have fallen in love with this series and have collected each installment, including this latest addition, Secret of the Wings.

The first thing I love about Wings is that it's another expansion of the Pixie Hollow universe. This is the reason ""The Great Fairy Rescue"" is my least favorite, because the fairies and their world, not just Tinkerbell's antics, are what I love the most. Wings does not disappoint here though! We get to see the world of the Winter fairies which has plenty in common with the ""warm fairies"" as they're called in this movie all of a sudden, but also plenty of differences! It's a new magical world for Tink to explore with new fairies to meet and adventures to be had.

The animation seems to keep getting better and better. The music is magical and the voice acting is spot on as always. We don't see much of Terrence in this one, but we see plenty of the other characters, including a short side story with the Queen herself (I forget her name...)

I especially enjoyed this one because of the introduction of Tinkerbell's sister, Perriwinkle. They have an instant bond as sisters that is animated very well and is very real. The love is there and it warms your heart to watch the siblings work together to overcome obstacles and never get into a single tiff along the way. I was waiting for the usual ""We meet, we love each other, oh but now we have a fight, and the climax of the movie is we forgive each other"" plot but that, thankfully, never came. These leaves kids and their siblings only with kind thoughts and the inspiration to work together and be there for one another which is great.

As an adult, I kind of saw the real ending coming even so and wish we hadn't had to just add some action in there at the end for a good climax and no other reason, but I also didn't mind the ending. It was a nice conclusion and I can't wait to see the next Tinkerbell adventure.

Special Features: The special features are the usual fair, with music videos and whatnot. My daughter and I enjoyed the short bonus clip featuring Tinkerbell and a Halloween Jack-o'-Lantern. I am also now kicking myself because the 20-some minute long ""Pixie Hollow Games"" movie is also included on both discs! I bought this by itself on Amazon instant video for 2.99 before Secret of the Wings had been released.

The Pixie Hollow Games features the garden fairies with Rosetta being our lead character for this feature. Think the Olympics with fairies, and the garden fairies have a pretty embarrassing losing streak. But it's Rosetta's turn to compete and she's happy just dropping out of the first round to spare herself the humiliation. She ends up being paired with a newer garden fairy who is anxious to compete and aim for the gold.

It's a really refreshing watch with the same Tinkerbell Pixie Hollow world and fantastic music but a new lead, and I think a lot of kids nowadays can relate to not wanting to compete in public, even when they do have a great chance at win. I knew plenty of kids when I was in school who would fail gym for lack of participation, simply because they were afraid of trying and failing. So this is a really great theme to share with little ones!

I don't have much else to say but... If you buy this, here's a tip. Do watch the included music video The Great Divide by the McClain Sisters. Not because the song is great (it is, I like it), but because it is hilarious. One of the sisters, being a new up and comer of course (you'll know her when you see her, I promise), is not super awesome at controlling her facial expressions for the camera. Throughout the whole music video, she shoots you looks like a lion on the prowl about to jump on some fresh meat and it had me laughing with my daughter having no idea why.

So don't be afraid to give Tinkerbell a shot with this one! Even my son loves the sense of adventure in every movie, especially this one. Definitely a must watch for siblings!",1356048000,,4110,4.447543160690571

I also found this movie to be a refreshing view of twinship.  I know I may be overly senstive, but I can't help but notice that most, no ALL, fictional twins are just copies of each other... speaking in unison etc.  Tinkerbell and Periwinkle (while having lots in common) are not just clones... they're not even dressed alike!  Its nice for my identical daughters to see a more individualized view of twins.  I also love the scene where they learn they are born of the same laugh... the laugh is basically an egg splitting to create the two fairies,  and I'm sure will be the reference point when our girls get curious about how they came to be twins!  There's plenty of years ahead for science... for now, let the fairies explain everything!!",1355702400,,885,4.563291139240507

Now she has friends and even a sister in Secret of the Wings.  Can't wait to see what the story writers will think to include in future episodes.

I couldn't even find a two-disc set, so I ended up ordering this stupid four-disc with 3D, which I can't even use and digital, which I won't use. After I sent my order to amazon.com I found the two-disc at Target for almost half the price. I am also disgusted that all the animated shorts for Disney Fairies shown on the Disney Channel are not included on this disc. What are they saving them for? The direct to DVD movies continue to get shorter (this is about 10 minutes shorter than the first one) so you get less for your money, too. They used to show the films on the Disney Channel a week after the DVDs came out. I finally checked before buying this one, but nothing was listed for two weeks, so I went ahead and bought it. Then, of course, they aired it about three weeks after releasing it on disc. There should be more (and better) extras for the price, too.

5101188,5,B007NU54H4,"I have to admit that I have never been a huge fan of fairy and princess films, but this one really enchanted the whole family- myself and my three year old daughter alike. My husband had to leave for work and missed the ending of the film the first time we watched it and the plot was decent enough that he asked to watch the ending the next day.

The graphics are beautiful and for adults the magic really is in the cleverly designed details of the fairy world- using owls for transportation for instance. It's a very creatively and cleverly designed world that you feel like you've been given an exclusive glimpse into.

My daughter was captured by all the forest animals, vibrant colors, and pixie dust- and now is a Tinkerbell fan. The film could also be a very fun introduction for young children to seasons, animal hibernation, and basic science concepts, like the reasons fire melt ice. We don't purchase dvds for our home collection often, but this one is well worth the price. Another great Disney film that I'd recommend to any parent I know!",1355184000,,1052,4.560846560846561

I especially liked that tinker belle had friends that were boys but they weren't pushing relationship stuff on them. This movie seems like one big romance story with most of the characters having ""loves and crushes on cute guys"" and Tink is asked if Terrance is her boyfriend. It felt more like a money maker than a story line with actual thought put into it.",1354752000,6,442,4.5375

5101233,5,B007NU54H4,"""Secret of the Wings"" is another fun installment in the fairy series. The story line of Tink having a sister is creative and a neat twist. Coupled with why the realms of the fairy world were separated and how that is resolved adds to the quality of the movie. With the interesting story line, lovable characters and all around charm, this is good, clean fun for the whole family. Especially our four year-old princess and her cousins.

The characters are not well balanced racially and in sexual orientation. They put in a Token black,Latinoe and boyish girl. This is not a real depiction of how are society is made up.

The Latino girl is depicted with her large butt and hips and her silly speach. The Black is the typical black made palletable for white audiences. (you know the type, all white features and a slightly tinted brown complexion. One Asian and an american Indian.

Films are supposed to be art. Not extension of the DNC.",1354320000,2,710,4.664

Who is Tinker Bell?

Tinker Bell, a fictional character that was developed back in 1904 by J.M. Barrie and later on in 1911 in the novel ""Peter and Wendy"" is best known for her appearance in the 1953 Walt Disney film ""Peter Pan"". The character is quite iconic for Disney, as she is quite literally the unofficial mascot for the Walt Disney Company and can be seen in many of their commercials and in 2008, the character received her first animated film which was direct-to-DVD and Blu-ray.

After the success of the first ""Tinker Bell"" film in 2008, the whole gang returned for the second film titled ""Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure"" in 2009,  and in 2010, Tinker Bell returned once more in ""Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue"".  Now, the fourth film in the series is titled ""Secret of the Wings"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD but also a Flitterific Fairies Double Pack which includes the Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy and a Blu-ray 3D.

VIDEO:

""Secret of the Wings"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1). First let me discuss the animation for this film and the Blu-ray version.  With each Tinker Bell-related film, I have talked about how each film gets better and better when it comes to the computer animation and overall rendering of the models and scenery.  There is more detail with each film and once again, ""Secret of the Wings"" looks vibrant and well-detailed with its colorful presentation.  On Blu-ray, the film is absolutely vibrant, sharp and the details are noticeable in HD.

And I can continue to list so many positives from the plants, the clothing, the accessories and the beautiful backgrounds, the lush green grass, the water and ice effects, the trees and even the animals are well detailed with their hair effects. Also, the special effects via CG from the lighting effects utilizing the pixie dust and then my favorite, the animated facial expressions, is just definitely great to look at. Although not a big budget theatrical film, ""Secret of the Wings"" looks absolutely beautiful.

But the biggest positive of ""Secret of the Wings"" is that the film was created with 3D in mind.  With the opening introduction of the film, you are greeted with objects that are coming right at you and immediately, you get to see how depth comes to play for this film.

From birds or fairies flying towards you, the film also adds depth to show height to various areas of the village that seem as if they are standing apart.  The 3D for this film looks great and it really helps that the film was created with 3D in mind, as opposed to other Disney films that are more 3D depth-based and were not originally created in 3D.

AUDIO:

As for audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  While the film is crystal clear when it comes to the dialogue and music, there are some moments that do utilize the surround channels and effectively uses ambiance to bring the film to life.  While not as immersive as I would have liked, the lossless audio for ""Secret of the Wings"" is still crisp and clear that families will find overall audio to be pleasing.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Secret of the Wings: Flitterific Fairies Double Pack "" comes with the following special features:

  Pixie Hollow Games Bonus Adventure - (22:34) In this short animated feature with the Disney Fairies, the fairies of Pixie Hollow take part in a Pixie Hollow Games competition.  But can anyone defeat the nine-consecutive Pixie Hollow Games champions, the Storm Fairies?
  ""Great Divide"" Music Video performed by the McClain Sisters - (3:03)
  ""Dig Down Deeper"" Music Video performed by Zendaya (from Pixie Hollow Games) - (3:08)
  Pixie Preview"" Fright Light - (1:02) A short animated feature about a mouse being chased by a rat.

EXTRAS:

""Secret of the Wings: Flitterific Fairies Double Pack"" comes with a special lenticular slip cover case (different from the graphic that you see above plus a Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy and a Blu-ray 3D version of the film.  The DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 - Enhanced for 169 televisions.  Subtitles are in Englsh SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Secret of the Wings"" is possibly the most touching Tinker Bell film I have seen thus far!  It's one thing to see Tinker Bell go on adventures and seeing her curiosity always leading her to good things but also bad things if she isn't careful.  The film does have important lessons for children, but the overall story makes for a very entertaining and touching family film.

It's an interesting storyline because we are introduced to Tinker Bell's sister, Periwinkle.  And it's rather touching and even emotional because they come from different lands that fairies from both Pixie Hollow and Winter Woods are to never cross to each other's lands.  And for these two sisters who just met with each other, to be forbidden to each other is sad.

But of course, this is a Tinker Bell film and she always tries to find a way.

But possibly the most memorable scenes are when both try to enjoy each other's company by experiencing the fun and enjoyable things of their two lands.  What beauty can the ice bring?  And of course with Tinker Bell's home, the beauty of flowers, water and butterflies flying in the air.  But when Periwinkle collapses because of the lack of cold weather and ice in Pixie Hollow, it becomes a battle of time to get her to safety before she loses her wings.  And another major trouble hits both lands as the seasons change due to an accident.  And the lives of fairies of both lands become threatened.

But as always, Tinker Bell always finds a way to get things fixed!

""Secret of the Wings"" will attract younger and older audiences with its friendly screenplay and beautiful animation and music. It's also a film that is very accessible for boys or girls because the cast of characters feature guys and girls as fairies.

As for the voice acting, ""Secret of the Wings"" uses major talent for this fourth film and the voice acting was fantastic!  You have Timothy Dalton (""James Bond"" films: ""License to Kill"", ""The Living Daylights"", ""The Tourist"") providing the voice of Lord Milori, Anjelica Huston (""The Addams Family"", ""50/50, ""The Royal Tennebaums"") as Queen Clarion, Megan Hilty (""Smash"", ""The Maiden and the Princess"") as Rosetta, Lucy Liu (""Charlie's Angels"", ""Kill Bill"") as Silver Mist and Lucy Hale (""Pretty Little Liars"", ""Privileged"") as Periwinkle.  And pretty much, all the voice talent from the three previous Tinker Bells films are back!  Including Mae Whitman as Tinker Bell, Raven-Symone as Iridessa and Jesse McCartney as Terence, to name a few.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Secret of the Wings: Flitterific Fairies Double Pack"" is outstanding.  The film was created with 3D in mind and this film delivers when it comes to objects or animals coming right at you and also to show great amount of depth as the Fairies and birds fly around Pixie Hollow and Winter Woods.  And as the Blu-ray 3D is effective, the regular Blu-ray looks absolutely gorgeous.  Once again, the animation impressed me with its vibrant colors, sharpness and detail.  You can see the characters blushing, you can see the detail on the flowers to the trees.  Water and ice effects look fantastic!  If anything, I know I gushed about the third film back  in 2010, but ""Secret of the Wings"" for 2012 looks even more impressive!  And  the fact you get four versions of the film (Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Download) is a plus!

And for special features, you get two videos, a very short Pixie Preview of ""Fright Light"" but you also get a 22-minute bonus animated adventure of ""Pixie Hollow Games"" featuring Tinker Bell and friends competing in various athletic games.

As for parents who are wondering if this film is scary at all, there really are no scary parts in this film. It's pretty safe!  But of course as parents, you just want to remind the children that there are rules that grownups make, in order to protect people from getting hurt.  And that is a message that is continually driven throughout the film.  But also the importance of love and teamwork.

Another magnificent animated film featuring one of Disney's most recognized iconic characters, ""Secret of the Wings' is a touching fantasy/adventure animated family film at its best and a perfect film for the entire family. A film created with 3D in mind, ""Secret of the Wings: Flitterific Fairies Double Pack"" is perfect for those who want to experience the film in 3D, in HD on Blu-ray, DVD or via Digital Copy.  Overall, ""Secret of the Wings"" is a wonderful film for the winter that is highly recommended!",1354320000,6,8945,4.7949052906597

They love them, the fact that there is a new one each year, just before Christmas, is something for them to look forward to at the holidays. Their ages are seven and nine, and they really love Tinkerbell.

Not only do they love to watch the movies, they take out several fairy books from the library, there are so many. It's great that the movies encourage them to read, especially these days, when children spend so much time playing video games etc. I will probably keep buying the new Tinkerbell movies every year until they stop making them, they are great for adults too, the color is out of this World.",1354147200,,702,4.571428571428571

Given I'm an adult man in his 40s that's saying something, add to that I never liked Peter Pan or that whole mythos as a kid...what gives appeal to this (and the other Tinkerbell films) for me is they manage to be fun without being treacly, dramatic without being intense; and best of all no song/dance numbers!  Add in good doses of G-rated humor and very stylized, attractive artwork and you have a most excellent film.",1353715200,,592,4.5046728971962615

They didn't know this movie had come out yet, so when I purchased it through our Tivo and let them have a movie night, they were in heaven.

5101364,5,B007NU54H4,I bought this dvd for my granddaughter. She absolutely loves it! She loves that Tinkerbell has a sister. The movie was well made and the graphics were good. This movie was definitely worth buying for her.,1353283200,,204,4.694444444444445
5101365,4,B007NU54H4,Enjoyed watching this movie with my 11 year old niece.  It is a good family movie.  Would recommend this movie.,1353196800,,111,4.5
5101366,5,B007NU54H4,"I bought this for my grandchildren, and loved it as much as they did. It's good to see where Disney and Pixar are going nowadays (I also picked up ""Brave""). No more of the ""my prince will come"" nonsense;strong,empowered girls are where it's at now, and as a grandfather I want to see that message passed along.

Won't even mention any details of the story, you really have to see it yourself. You might guess that love, teamwork, and possibly endangering yourself for the good of others is all in there. Please watch it, you'll be glad you did.",1353196800,,544,4.494949494949495

5101368,5,B007NU54H4,"The story line was great!  Being able to find a sister that you didn't know about coupled with a tragedy.  My wife thought that it was a little dark for my daughter (being 4 years old); however, I ended up watching it with my wife from the beginning and felt that the story line was appropriate.  This isn't as dark as the Treasure Hunt -- which my daughter did get a little scared at one point.

I'd recommend watching this during the day just to be safe.  My daughter tends to dream about the last thing that she saw.  So, we had her watch a fun uplifting show that she is use to.  Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend it!",1353110400,,623,4.228813559322034
5101369,5,B007NU54H4,"My almost eight-year-old daughter loves the Disney Fairies movies and we have all of the DVDs including this latest title. ""Secret of the Wings"" is our favorite of the series (followed by the first, third, and finally the second in the series) so far. It is a beautiful movie bringing to vivid life the world of the warm fairies and the winter fairies. The storyline is the best in the series so far, in my humble opinion. Tinker Bell makes a startling discovery in this story - she has a sister named Periwinkle. Trouble is, Periwinkle is a winter/frost fairy and the siblings can never be together because they come from different worlds and will face difficulties in each other's world.

I loved the creative twists in the plot as Tinker tries her best to find a way to spend time with her newly-found sister. Tinker gets plenty of help from her ever sympathetic friends such as Rosetta, Iridessa, Silver Mist, and even fast-flying fairy Vidia, who used to be so mean to Tinker in the past. The theme of sisterly love, the strong bonds of family and friendship, and self-sacrifice is beautifully woven into the plot, making this an engaging watch for both young and old alike. I usually watch the movies with my daughter and found myself particularly captivated by this story. The sneak peek on the DVD indicates there's another Tinker movie coming next year and we wait in anticipation. Meanwhile, this DVD is going to get plenty of repeat viewings by my little one!",1353110400,,1470,4.6976744186046515

5101372,3,B007NU54H4,"I own all the new tinkerbell movies starting with tinkerbell (which came with my trial disney movie subscription), with the exception of ""The Great Fairy Rescue"" they are all wonderful! The visual effects and scenery of the wonderful world of fairies is worth getting the blu-ray version!

We have always wanted to go into the winter woods area out of pixie hollow and now you can in a movie that my 5year old son, my husband, me, and my young niece all enjoyed it, whats more is even my son who has been all about ""boy things"" asked to watch it again and again.

*If you're looking for Terrance (my favorite character besides tinkerbell and rosetta-HES NOT IN THIS MOVIE-also the snowball fight scene from some of the preview/trailers also didn't make the final cut : /

In this adventure, Tinker Bell(Mae Whitman) is being drawn to the forbidden Winter Woods after her wings started to glow, Once there, Tink meet a friendly frost-talent fairy named Periwinkle(Lucy Hale) who shares the same glowing wings. After consulting the keeper of the Pixie Books, Tink and Periwinkle has made a startling discovery, they are more than best friends, they're sisters!! And now, a great threat is hindering both Pixie Hollow and The Winter Woods, and Tink, Periwinkle and all the fairies must work together to prevent it, and Tink must make a great sacrifice! Jesse McCartney, Raven, Lucy Liu, Anjelica Huston, Timothy Dalton(from the James Bond movies), and Pamela Aldon also star in this amazing family film.

My 8 year old granddaughter tends to get bored easily and chats through movies ~ she didn't say a word. My 13 and 12 yr old granddaughters loved the other Tinkerbell movies but this was when they were a few years younger. I was hesitant to purchase as I did not think they would watch more than once at best. Instead, I rented through Amazon Instant Videos. The movie streamed perfectly and got 3 ""mini critic"" rave reviews. They said this was the best Tinkerbell movie of them all. Looks like I will have to purchase after all.",1352937600,,637,4.2727272727272725
5101384,2,B007NU54H4,"SPOILER ALERT: Tinker Bell gets her wing broken, but her twin sister Periwinkle is able to heal it (broken wings are supposed to be incurable.)  So essentially the consequence of Tinker Bell's mistake that caused the break is erased.  Also, when Pixie Hollow is frozen, the Lord of Winter Woods says, ""This happened because we tried to keep [Tinker Bell and Periwinkle] apart."" - So the blame for the catastrophe is put on the rule and the rulemakers (Warm fairies are not allowed to cross the border into Winter Woods and vice versa).  There is no responsibility placed on Tinker Bell and Periwinkle for choosing to break the rule.  I would have liked to have seen a more balanced resolution that values obedience for the sake of safety, and taking responsibility for one's actions.

All THREE of the other Tinker Bell movies have terrific moral lessons:  accepting who you are, forgiving others and valuing friendship, tolerating and learning about those from other worlds (cultures), putting others before yourself.  But from a parenting perspective, given that Tinker Bell is the heroine and the role model when little girls do their natural copy-cat role-play, this one was a big disappointment!",1352937600,11,1200,5.03030303030303

5101391,5,B007NU54H4,"I purchased Secret of the Wings because my granddaughter loves Tinkerbell--we play with Tink and her friends often.  When I previewed the film, I was especially pleased that Disney excluded any scary villains that could give a young child nightmares.  When Bonnilee came to visit, she watched Secret of the Wings three times.  This three year old was captivated by the story of the two sisters ""risking their wings"" to see and experience each other's world.

I don't think my 4-yr old likes the Fairy stories enough to care which is better but she did watch the whole movie.

I do stream some free Prime videos and rarely pay but wanted to watch this (I'm a big Disney fan). Not related to this movie but I would be prefer some kind of ""2 time"" deal instead of 48-hours. I think it'd be more useful for us to watch it again (with another kid) later in the week than watching it again in same 48-hour span.  I like to preview some movies before I let her watch and also she often doesn't feel like finishing it so we don't always get back to TV within 48 hours to finish.",1352764800,2,787,4.1644736842105265

Her interest has waned over the past two years and I can't even remember the last time she asked me to put on a tinkerbell movie for her but since she got this movie it is what she wants to watch everyday.

5101413,5,B007NU54H4,"I have always loved Tinkerbell and I think it is awesome of Disney with how they have been coming out with all these Tinkerbell-inspired movies.  ""Secret of the Wings"" is a a movie where Tinkerbell heads over to the winter fairy world and discovers she has a sister!  The two fairies do not exsist in each other's worlds due to one being a warm fairy and the other a cold fairy.  Tinkerbell is of course up to mischeif as she has her adventures in the winter fairy world and then brings her sister to hers, but trouble arises.  The movie is full of fun songs and wholesome lessons.  I watched this with my boys and they loved it, so it is definitely not just a girl movie.  I love the Blu-ray edition as it comes with both a Blu-ray disc, DVD, and Digital Copy, with this edition also including a Blu-ray 3D copy (unfortantely we don't have a 3D player though.)

The story was easy to follow and I enjoyed watching it right alongside my kids.  The animation is so full of color and so well done.  I know for some Disney sequel-type movies the animation slips or is just not drawn the same, but in this movie the animation is perfect.  This is a must-have DVD for any Disney fan or Tinkerbell fan!",1352160000,,1196,4.299107142857143
5101414,4,B007NU54H4,"Meet Tinker Bell who flies everywhere
Her land is warm, her weather's fair
But Peri's only seen the sights
Of winter days and winter nights
What a crazy pair!
But they're fairies, identical fairies all the way
One pair of sprightly pixies, different as night and day!

While Peri adores to pirouette
On landscapes cold as they can get
Our Tink just seems to have the goal
Of making Vidia lose control
What a wild duet!

But they're fairies, identical fairies and you'll find
Their wings get sparkly rays alike, they even disobey alike
You could lose your mind
When fairies are two of a kind!

Tinker Bell: The Secret of the Wings, the first Disney Fairies feature to actually be released near the actual season in which it takes place, is a sweeping epic in which Tink discovers she has a twin sister, Periwinkle. Peri lives in a frosty world ruled by former James Bond Timothy Dalton (who also voiced Mr. Pricklypants in Toy Story 3). Naturally, the twins spend too much time in their respective other lands and adventures ensue.

It's a beautifully rendered production, really an art direction triumph. And in Blu-ray, it's especially stunning to see. The songs are by the talented husband and wife duo Valerie Vigoda and Brendan Milburn, who also recently scored a musical version of Toy Story for Disney Cruise Line and have a series of inventive original musicals created for their band, Groovelily.

The teen angle has been ramped up in this film, with the addition of more ""hunky"" sprites, almost to the point of being unintentionally humorous, as in one final moment in which a young guy struts onto the scene and says, ""Hey. I'm Sled.""

Vigoda and Milburn also wrote songs for Pixie Hollow Games, a 30-minute TV special relegated to bonus features status on this package. What it might lack in budget compared to the more lavish Wings feature, it makes up for in charm and character development.

Pixie Hollow Games focuses on two fairies: Rosetta, voiced to perfection by Megan Hilty, and newcomer Chloe, played by Brenda Song (of Zack & Cody and The Social Network). Rosetta may be a garden fairy, but she's a tootsie-toes with more than a touch of OCD. Chloe's atheticism makes the two of them an ""Odd Couple"" and thus fodder for a very entertaining, fast moving and fun little show.

The extras are not elaborate, not even on a promotional level, when compared to earlier Tinker Bell releases. Wings is nice, but Great Fairy Rescue is still, to me, the best of the four features so far.",1352160000,,2499,4.715596330275229

5101417,4,B007NU54H4,"I pre-ordered Secret of the Wings - my oldest daughter is six and we have all the Tinkerbell films. I'm giving this one four stars - it's very good and fulfilling its main purpose of entertaining my children. Beyond that, the graphics/anmation quality on Blu-Ray are excellent, the story is pretty creative and there are lots of cute/cool fairy moments.

I felt this was a good value for the price, considering that you get a Blu-Ray, normal DVD, 3D DVD and a digital copy.

My slight beef with this film is that the climax of the story was a little too ""The Day After Tomorrow"" for me and I could have done without the Dewey character, who shall henceforth be known as the Jar Jar Binks of Disney Fairies.

Overall, it's enjoyable and you can watch with the kids without wishing you had imbibed an adult beverage beforehand. I like Tinkberbell and the Lost Treasure the best of all four films, The Great Fairy Rescue the least and I would put Secret of the Wings and the initial Tinkerbell film neck and neck.",1351900800,,1010,4.508196721311475

We loved the whole story line with the new fairies and how they came to be. This is def one to buy if your a big fan like we are! You won't be dissapointed, def worth the money to buy as you will be watching it over and over with your little one. As for adults, you can sit and enjoy it just as much as the children.

Also the Minister of Winter makes an appearance or two and she doesn't exist in this movie, being replaced by the Lord of Winter...). This is enough to bother me, but not my daughter (4 years old) yet. She was upset by the missing scenes, the pictures on the cover of the movie are misleading as some of the 'screenshots' never happen.

5101422,2,B007NU54H4,"This is not the best of the Tink series (that would be the Great Fairy Rescue).  The story in outline is sweet, but it's grounded by inflated melodrama and the really awful songs that are poured over every montage like syrup.  Does every preteen singer sound the same, regardless of gender?  The McClain sisters could have been manufactured in the Disney factory; there is nothing original, personal or distinctive about the songs or their performances: it's an assembly of pre-fab parts and it drags the movie down.",1351814400,8,516,4.908045977011494
5101423,5,B007NU54H4,"I really liked this movie. It was more serious and dramatic than the older ones (especially the bubbly ""Great Fairy Rescue""). The graphic and music were really awesome. The characters won my heart as well. BUT! There is something I just have to tell about. I don't know if this is a spoiler or not, so if you didn't watch it, then better don't read it.

There are few things I don't understand.

1) The winter fairies cannot leave the Winter Woods, because if they do, their wings will melt and break. But in the first ""Tinkerbell"" movie the snow fairies didn't have any problems with visiting the warmer places. There was even Quana who put the magical snowflake on the mushroom. The Minister of Winter (that tall, white-haired woman) also visited the Queen's Pixie Dust Tree. None of them had a problem with wings or fainting of heat. I know that the ""Tinkerbell"" was made before ""Secret of the Wings"" but I don't like the mistakes like that. In the first 3 movies the winter fairies could easily fly to the warm kingdroms and in this one they can't?

2) If the winter fairies cannot leave the Winter Woods because of their wings, then how do they travel to the mainland? They have to pass by the ocean and visit the warm countries. There is no snow or coldness.

And finally the number 3 - but it is related with the all movies about Tinkerbell. The main characters like Tink, Fawn, Rosetta, Silvermist, Fairy Mary, Queen Clarion or the couple of the guys have original looks. But the rest of the fairies look almost the same. There are only few styles of looks and the Disney company doesn't care about creating more. For example - one of the winter fairies looked exactly like the crying one from the ""Pixie Hollow games"". Another male fairy looked like Buck. It happens all the time and is annoying, because the certain fairies lose their individuality.

That's all I wanted to write. ""The Secret of the Wings"" is a very nice movie and people who have seen the earlier movies probably will like it.",1351814400,2,2004,4.54016620498615
5101424,5,B007NU54H4,"My 4yr old, 2yr old, husband and I absolutely loved this movie.  It has a really good story line and is overall another great hit.",1351728000,,130,4.2
5101425,4,B007NU54H4,"Disney continues its ""Fairies"" franchise with the latest entry in the series, ""Secret of the Wings."" This marks the fourth movie and there doesn't look to be an end in sight with next year's addition already scheduled. Timing couldn't be better to release the newest sequel since it takes place in the land of Winter and would make the perfect gift for Christmas for any little girl.

A curious Tinker Bell ignores the rules of warm fairies and ventures into the forbidden world of winter. Her dangerous excursion leads her to uncover a mysterious secret and almost break a wing . A bizarre glow overcomes her wings during the quick visit, which drives Tinker Bell to return and delve deeper into the winter woods in search of the Keeper of all fairy knowledge.

As is usual with Disney's Blu-ray releases, ""Secret of the Wings"" looks fabulous. Its CG animation is clean and picture perfect. A greater amount of visual depth can be felt when watching the 3D version of the film. However, the 2D version is stunning as well. The color schemes are beautiful no matter if the screen is filled with striking whites or darker tones.

A 5.1 surround sound mix guarantees maximum audio enjoyment for viewers. The magical sounds of the fairy world, dialogue, and musical score really get a chance to make an impact on home theater audiences. As if there would ever be any question about Disney providing their loyal ""Fairy"" fans with a high quality audio experience.

Special features include a bonus 22-minute adventure entitled ""Pixie Hollow Games."" It also contains two music videos by McClain Sisters and Zendaya. There's a never-before-seen preview of ""Fright Light"" and deleted scenes with introductions by the filmmaker as well.

The ""Secret of the Wings"" 4-disc combo pack gives Disney collectors every possible format for people to view the movie in. There's a regular DVD, a digital copy to watch on the go, and 2D and 3D Blu-ray versions. It's a great addition to any ""Fairies"" enthusiast's home entertainment library.",1351728000,4,2021,4.914956011730205
5101426,5,B007NU54H4,"I am a dyed-in-the-wool Tink fan.  Ever have been since I first read ""Peter Pan"".

Of course I'm also an avid Tinkerbell collector as well.

Of the 4 movies, this is by far the best of the bunch.  Great story line that constantly moves forward.  Tink really shows the heroine part of her as well but thanks to Periwinkle, all things turn out for the best.  Just goes to show how important family really is to all of us.

Great job on the new fairies and voicings.  The score is also VERY good, truly worthy of a symphony orchestra.  The songs...well...they are passable and the worst part of the movie.  Fortunately, there aren't too many of them.  Incidental music belongs incidental to the movie, not as the soundtrack.  Thank you Disney for realizing this.

I rented this at first, watched it 5 times and then bought it.  Like a good book, I still can't put it down!

For the child in all of us that still believes (clap those hands), this is the perfect Tinkerbell movie.

However, I couldn't pull myself away and ended viewing the entire movie with them, complete with a lump in the throat and a smile on my face at the end.  To sum up my experience in a trite phrase, ""I laughed, I cried, it moved me"".  :-)

Seriously, I was not expecting much from this film.  I got it because my daughter (age 7) and son (age 9) really enjoyed the other Tinkerbell movies, which we own.  However, I never expected to enjoy it myself, as an adult.  I was greatly mistaken.  In fact, our kids are watching it again (for about the 8th time) with their aunt and uncle (who are also enjoying it very much).

Another quick note...  We purchased the 3D/Blu-ray/DVD package.  I can definitively say that the picture quality on the blu-ray is breathtaking!  Additionally, the 3D is amazing!  Definitely a great 3D disc to have if you're looking for more family films to add to your library.

Needless to say, this was a great purchase.  I know this movie will be in heavy rotation in our home for years to come.  Highly recommended!

P.S.  I read that some people might be concerned about possible ""environmental"" overtones in this film.  Look, I'm politically conservative and am sensitive to outright propaganda, but that is just nowhere in this film.  If someone finds it in this movie, they are probably either ultra sensitive or really, really reaching.  This is just a terrifically fun film for the entire family, with a refreshingly original story-line, and is very moving to boot!  Enjoy!  :-)",1351209600,5,1683,4.585858585858586

5101448,5,B007NU54H4,"I have so enjoyed all the Tinker Bell movies that have come from the Disney/Pixar studios, & I was not the least bit disappointed in this latest entry.

Among all the faeries in Pixie Hollow, Tinker Bell has always been the most adventurous fairy.

While she enjoys her life as a tinker, & has made a lot of friends, she has this insatiable curiosity to explore beyond her own little ""nitch"" in Pixie Hollow.

Pixie Hollow is an area of Neverland, where all four seasons exists side by side-Summer, Autumn, Winter, & Spring.

But Winter, has always been forbidden to enter for the fairies of Spring, Summer, & Autumn, because the cold could very easily damage their wings-even causing them to break, if not immediately treated.

But that isn't about to stop Tinker Bell.

After something causes her wings to start glowing, after a very brief trip into Winter Wood, Tinker Bell fashions winter clothes to keep her warm, & stows away in baskets that the other tinker faeries, have made for the winter faeries.

There she meets frost fairy named Periwinkle, who she discovers was born of the same child's laugh that Tinker Bell was born from-which makes them sisters.

Tinker Bell & Periwinkle aren't about to break off their friendship, just because they live in two different worlds, even if it IS forbidden.

We see Tinker Bell's ingenuity in making it possible for Periwinkle to visit Tinker Bell's world, which almost ends in disaster for the frost fairy.

We find out from both Queen Clarion & the winter lord, Lord Malori, why it is forbidden for the warm weather fairies & the winter faeries to ever be together.

When the machine that Tinker Bell, with her friends Clank & Bobble, made to show Periwinkle the warm lands, causes a freeze that threatens ALL the seasons of Pixie Hollow, it is up to both Tinker Bell & Periwinkle to save the most important area in all of Neverland-the Pixie Dust Tree, source of all their magic, & indeed, their very lives, because the Pixies Dust tree links both Winter Woods & the warm lands.

Voice casting in this movie reunites all the major characters of Pixie Hollow.

We also see familiar voices as well, including Disney alumni Timothy Dalton, (Mr. Pricklepants, from Toy Story 3), as the voice of Lord Malori, & Jodi Benson, (of Little Mermaid fame, as a healing fairy).

What I found very enjoyable, was how Tinker Bell's former nemesis, Vidia-had ""toned-down"" her cynicism & contempt of Tinker Bell, (which was undoubtedly due to Tinker Bell rescuing her in the previous movie-Tinker Bell & The Great Fairy Rescue).  But you could still see traces of her cynicism throughout the movie, though Tinker Bell & her had resolved much of their rivalry with each other, & were indeed friends.

The music, the storyline, the interaction among all the fairies, kept this movie moving very well, & I was never bored during it.

The characters have been very believable throughout all the previous movies, & that has not changed here.

This is another excellent addition to the vast library of Disney movies, & is sure to become a classic, as the past 3 Tinker Bell movies have become!",1351209600,,3123,4.7518518518518515

This is funny, because I was just enjoying it, thinking what a good job they've done on this intallment.  But then I realized, she is right.  What's up with the disobedience?  I try and teach my children to come to me and we can talk about something if they disagree with it.  Communication to me, is very important.  I teach my children that we have rules for a reason.  So, despite the fact that I think this was quite a good movie, I wish there were some things that were different.  There is far too much sneaking around and doing things that are against the rules.  I know this would have made the movie, as it is, impossible to make, but...I really don't want my kids to get the idea that if they disobey the rules and sneak around behind my back that great things will happen...because unfortunately that's not always the case.

Still, besides my fuddyduddyishness ***word?***, I did think the characters were cute and I liked that they worked together in the end to save the day.  I enjoy a fiestier Tink, and in this one, she's all sweetness.  The animation is excellent and it's visually a beautiful show. It's also great for the imagination.

5101459,5,B007NU54H4,"My daughter ADORES the Disney Fairies franchise. This movie was such a great addition. ""The Pixie Hollows Games"" short was very good as well. This movie keeps in the spirit of the other movies, and if you are a fan I highly encourage you to get it.

We try to get the digital copies because it helps to have them on our handheld devices while travelling. It's definitely a lifesaver!",1350950400,5,383,4.4714285714285715
5101460,4,B007NU54H4,"First off, I want to express some dissatisfaction with Amazon and Disney Movie Rewards for not coordinating efforts on DMR's coupon offer. I ended up buying this elsewhere because Amazon does not take DMR coupons. There has got to be a way around this. I would much rather buy it on Amazon and have it delivered to my door.

At any rate, Disney has hit it out of the park again with this one. There is a compelling story, surprisingly good animation for a direct to home video movie, good eye candy, great new voices and characters, old characters get appropriate screen time, and it beats the new stuff that Mattel is producing hands down. Monster High started off with a real stinker on DVD, and the Barbie movies are becoming unwatchable. The Tinker Bell movies are all good overall, but this one is probably the best.

Fans of the Tinker Bell from Disney's Peter Pan should know that the character has been homogenized for mass consumption in these movies. This is a kinder, gentler Tinker Bell, made to sell toys to little girls. It's not intended for people waxing nostalgic for the little fairy in Peter Pan whose behavior was sometimes a bit sociopathic.

In this installment, Tinker Bell meets her sister, a winter fairy who was born from the same baby's laugh as Tinker Bell. Tinker Bell breaks the rules again, because her curiosity is strong and that's just what she does. Winter fairies and spring/summer/autumn fairies cross into each others' worlds, and Tinker Bell and friends must once again save Pixie Hollow and the pixie dust tree.
Everything is better with sparkles - The fairy queen's dress is made of pixie dust, and there is plenty of glittery snow, with sparkling wings and other shiny things. The movie is visually appealing and is pretty to watch. Not to mention the handsome new male characters introduced as love interests for other peripheral characters.

Hey, it's that guy! - There are plenty of celebrity voices in this edition, including heavy-hitters like Timothy Dalton and Angelica Huston. There are plenty of young, up and coming actors who lent their voices to this too, so there will be celebrity voices that just about everyone will recognize. Even some of the characters are familiar--Dewey appears to be channeling Father Guido Sarducci. This is an old, rather obscure reference that few people will get, but it was interesting to hear this accent on a librarian fairy.

The extra features on the 4 disc combo pack are OK. There are 2 music videos and a teaser for the next Tinkerbell feature, along with a mini-movie called Pixie Hollow Games. Whatever you do, do not select the sneak peeks. There are so many of them that go for so long that by the time they're done, the polar ice caps will have melted and the earth will be ruled by dirty apes.

I don't see anything here that might be considered inappropriate for children, and I would be comfortable watching this with the whole family. I think that this movie is something you will enjoy if you can accept this version of Tinker Bell, and if you enjoy children's movies in general. This is a great story with great lessons and clean adventure for everyone.",1350950400,6,3156,4.7290909090909095
5101461,5,B007NU54H4,"Like all of the Tinkerbell movies made since 2008 they have continued on with the small, yet large adventures that teach important lessons often times about friendship. The animation used is top notch and lives up to the Disney standard. What I have always liked about these movies is the environment that it takes place in. We get to see all of the little structures built cleverly out of ordinary materials that humans such as ourselves would never dream of using in such a way. The landscapes are extremely vibrant and really look alive.

I am a 22 year old animation student and even though this is targeted at young girls it still is a testament of the quality that comes out of Disney studios. They have the right creative team behind these productions and I hope to see more in the future.",1350950400,,796,4.566433566433567
5101462,5,B007NU54H4,"This is such a super cute DVD. I love how you pre-order it and Amazon gets it to you the day it comes out. My daughter was so excited, she has been talking about the fairy movie for ever.",1350950400,,187,3.8205128205128207
5101463,5,B007NU54H4,"This is by far the best of Tinkerbell films to be made.  The DVD include among the bonus area a pair of music videos, the first time I believe a pixie preview short is place on a DVD and the made-for-TV special Pixie Hollow Games.  I once heard that only four Tinkerbell movies were planned but this video also has a preview for a new Tinkerbell movie coming out in the Spring where Tink and her friend have an accident that results in them swapping powers and abilities.

The movie itself I think is the best Tinkerbell movie made yet.  Like the first Tinkerbell movie we have Tink as curious now about the winter woods as she once was about the main land and just as much want to visit there. When Fawn need help herding animals there she thought she had her chance to explore. Just when her wings start to glow, Fawn pulls her back and tell her its against fairy law for Winter fairies to cross over to their side or warm fairies to cross over into winter. AS she tries to learn more about why her wings glowed she decide to stow away on the next owl pick up to the winter woods after re-designing the outfit she wore in Lost Treasure for winter warmth. It is there that she meets her sister and find out how much alike they are. Being sisters when their wings are put together they have a secret power no fairy has ever seen before.  The two work together with a plan to try to convince the Lord of Winter and Queen Cleareon to resin the law about crossing over which like most of Tinkerbell's plans get worst before things get better.",1350950400,2,1539,4.274914089347079
5101464,5,B007NU54H4,We love the Tinker Bell movies and this one did not disappoint.  It was a wonderful story filled with adventure and fun.  My 6 year old son and 3 year old daughter really enjoyed!!,1350950400,6,180,4.264705882352941
5101465,5,B007NU54H4,"I've known of Tinker Bell since I was a little girl, mostly from movies such as Peter Pan, Hook, and seeing her flittering about the screen for many things Disney.  Until recently I never watched one of the Tinker Bell fairy movies though.  I had the opportunity to screen Secret of the Wings in 3D while I was in Los Angeles in August, and then rewatched it after receiving the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack to review.

Secret of the Wings is the fourth Disney fairies movie and finally explores winter.  The first four movies each focus on a different season.  Winter is often tricky to animate due to the snow.  Of course, Disney does a fabulous job because they make sure to study nature and keep it as real as possible - from the falling snow to the plants used for their clothing.

The biggest surprise in Secret of the Wings, besides the Winter Fairies and the Winter Woods, is learning that Tinker Bell has a sister named Periwinkle!  Neither of them knew about the other, so we get to join them as they become fast friends and catch up with each other.  This movie really shows some of the fun quirkiness you'll find between sisters and does well at forging an emotional connection.

Unfortunately, there are dangers to warm fairies crossing into the Winter Woods and vice versa.  It's so dangerous that there's even a rule forbidding fairies to cross which upsets the girls.  They don't wish to be separated any longer, but defying this rule causes trouble for the Autumn Woods and threatens life for all fairies.  It takes some serious team work to make everything right again.

I really enjoyed this movie (especially in 3D).  The writing is excellent in evoking emotion - I teared up several times the first time I watched it.  And... I still teared up at least once when I watched it again with my daughter.

One thing I will say is that this movie is not overly girly.  I know most people will think a fairy movie is for girls, but there are boy fairies in it as well.  I didn't find it to be something that only girls would want to watch - I think most little kids (regardless of being a boy or a girl) would enjoy watching the Secret of the Wings!

This movie has lots of positive messages about family, friends, team work, and even parenting.  When you learn about the rule about not allowing the fairies to cross over, I think you'll see how that can apply to parenting decisions and rules.

*I attended a press screening and also received a copy to review.",1350864000,4,2469,4.488789237668161
5101466,5,B007NU54H4,"I have to admit that Disney's Tinker bell movies have become something of a guilty pleasure for me. I say ""guilty pleasure"" because I'm a 41 year old male - hardly Disney's target audience for the Tinker Bell movies! What's more, I can't even use the ""I watched this with my kids"" excuse cos I don't have any!! But I believe these movies can be enjoyed by people of any age - male or female! I watched Secret of the Wings last night and thoroughly enjoyed it, and it's easily as good as the other 3 movies, possibly the best yet. My favourite so far was TB and The Lost Treasure, but this could easily surpass that after further viewings. It's wintry setting with all the snow and ice really give the film an enchanting, magical feel. I watched this on Blu-ray (2D) and the picture quality - as expected from Disney - is amazing. The winter setting with it's icy whites and cool blues really look great. This film really deserves to be seen in HD. All of the animation is top notch too - everything from the characters to the beautiful falling snow looks great. Don't think for a minute that because this is a straight-to-video release Disney have knocked out a sub-par release. This looks just as good as most other CG animated films that get the full theatrical release. FYI this film was at one point known as ""Tinker Bell and the Mysterious Winter Woods"". I will definitely be watching this again soon, and have no doubt that younger viewers could easily watch it many, many times. There's also trailer on this disc for the next TB adventure coming in Spring 2014...I can't wait!",1350777600,31,1583,4.5

In fact, they've watched it 4 times within a week already :). For me, I find 'Great Fairy Rescue' to be the best in the series, 'Secret of the Wings' is a close 2nd, followed by the first, then 'Lost treasure'.

The Blu-ray video quality is simply reference grade, with the DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio also very good. No banding in the video as you sometimes get in animations, with crisp picture and lots of detail as expected from a completely digital source. The extras included are on the skimpy side, with the main highlight being 'Pixie Hollow Games', the so-so short that aired on the Disney channel earlier this year.",1350518400,3,735,4.444444444444445
