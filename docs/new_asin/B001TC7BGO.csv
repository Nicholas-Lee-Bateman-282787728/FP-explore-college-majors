8340971,4,B001TC7BGO,"In the 60s, this lovely film used to play frequently on Saturday afternoons, and I watched it, over and over.  I loved it, and even more so when my mother told me the two stars were married when it was made, allowing a deeppening of the fantasy for me when viewing the movie.  I keep hoping it will be released on dvd, or even in streaming form. Come on, folks...release some of these gems!",1459296000,2,390,4.256756756756757
8340972,5,B001TC7BGO,"After seeing this movie, over 30 yrs. ago , I still can't forget it !! I keep hoping I can get a DVD of it to add to my collection of favorites . Can't afford $124 . So, I'm hoping TCM will show it sometime ( I continue to check their schedule, with no luck )  . This movie is top notch ! The story and the acting are superb ! Rex Harrison and lilli Palmer , just draw you into their characters and keep you spellbound !  Four Poster will always remain one of the greatest films that I've ever seen !! I'm really sorry that so many movie lovers out there , may never have the opportunity and pleasure of seeing this hidden treasure  !!",1359676800,6,635,3.984251968503937

8340975,3,B001TC7BGO,"Film collecters and die hard fans of Rex Harrison should order this film if they have never seen the Four Poster. They filmed it just like the play. They used quick animation cartoon to to show the couple in the outside world, otherwise their whole lifes from marriage to death takes places in their bed room with the the Four poster. Unfortunely I received a really bad copy from a poor copy. It is in black and white but the copy faded in and out from dark to washed out white, it was copied in the wrong aspect ratio to DVD. The animation segments went back and forth from crisp to muddy. I have only seen this bad a copy 2 or 3 times, it was always when a friend copied something from a poor black/white TV set and sent it with ""you got to see this"" note. I don't want to blame the company it came from, this might be the only source they had to copy from, and did not have the ability to correct it. I am really not a film buff, I enjoy only watching good copies, I returned it for refund, it was too poor to watch again.",1241222400,14,1026,4.059113300492611
