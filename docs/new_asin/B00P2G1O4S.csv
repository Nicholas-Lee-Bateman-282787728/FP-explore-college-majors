6785751,3,B00P2G1O4S,"The Atticus institute was founded by Dr. Henry West (William Mapother) to study parapsychology and to test possible candidates with mental abilities. Things seem normal until they find Judith (Rya Kihlstedt) who tests very well. The group discovers that instead of just having abilities she may be possessed. The military gets involved.

The film is done as a mockumentary with numerous interviews spaced between the action. It was done fairly well and I expect this to be on the History or Discovery Channel someday following ""They Saved Hilter's Brain."" I was mildly entertained by the film, but not scared or excited. With half the film being interviews, it is hard to say anything bad about the acting. It had the feel of the hand held genre and might do well with fans of that kind of film. Would work as a Redbox rental.

6785752,4,B00P2G1O4S,I was very happy with this film. I really enjoyed the dated look and the downplay of the classic horror scares. The story was new storyline with a delicately handled demon possesion. Actually the U.S. sucked but you can't trust Demons. I know a lot of people said that the Possesion thing is played out so better it be a Vampire or a Zombie?,1421366400,,341,4.34375
6785753,1,B00P2G1O4S,"Ho-Hum.  I gave it a watch because the reviews were as different as they could be but the trailer looked ok.  I don't have anything else to say except it was just plain boring.  I did actually dose off several times but upon opening my eyes, I was able to pick right back up where the story left off (what does that tell you).  It was a struggle for me to finish it, but, I did hang in there until the bitter end.  I wasn't disappointed, the end was bitter and uneventful.

6785754,4,B00P2G1O4S,"** NO SPOILERS ** This film combines a number of surprisingly engaging elements including plot and acting (the basics) but also very good camerawork. It's not a ""found footage"" movie, but it does rely heavily on ""archived"" footage from the days of the experiments conducted in the film. It's about as believable a supernatural horror film as you'll come across. I'm extremely critical at times in my reviews, as there have been a glut of truly terrible entries in this genre lately. So, I was not expecting this one at all - I can only describe it as a diamond in the rough. The special effects/CGI are low-key, and also excellent and not once did I feel the film descended into anything cheesy, as is too often the case. I really - ok, almost - felt as if this was an actual documented event, and I really cannot recommend this one highly enough for jaded fans of low budget horror. I have watched it three times since it was released on Amazon Instant Video, and Im actually watching it again right now. The only downside, in my opinion, was that the acting - specifically the interviews conducted as part of the ""look back"" on the story - was not as good as it could have been and did pull me out of the film a bit. Butm with the glut of lame low budget flicks flooding the market today, this was a fun surprise.",1421107200,4,1315,4.39344262295082
6785755,4,B00P2G1O4S,"(Spoiler Alert: a sketchy overview follows)

From a beginning that quickly turns bizarre to a low-key conclusion, we see in The Atticus Institute a movie rich in intelligence and skill.  It takes both to produce a work of terror that is so utterly believable.

TAI is well-made and worth seeing.

The first strong impression TAI creates is through color: three different types of film appear used--grainy black and white for some lab tests; faded and filtered color stock shot in the 70's, and crisp and clear footage from the present.

This is necessary and effective since there is an interplay of past and present. In fact, one critical shift toward the dark and dangerous appears when the shadowy presence of National Security Agency officials come on camera in both the 70's and present. This interplay roots all we see in both the unfolding of past events and present understandings and reflections.

From the start, the scientists at AI appear thoughtful, serious, committed researchers who ,when they discover their greatest test subject was a fake, consider ending the program.

But then they meet Judith.

She tests passed any established measure and later manifests breathtaking and perhaps dangerous powers. (Thus researchers' quote I used as a title.)

Soon after, the NSA's role in the research shifts from covert to overt and finally government agents take over the program.

At this point, ""she"" becomes ""it"" and the NSA tries to weaponize ""It.""

Beyond this sketchy overview, general praise merits specific clarification. The cast is uniformly convincing, if not always equal in skill; the direction is insightful and assured; the editing is dramatic and effective; the soundtrack is the kind that plays just below awareness and like TAI's script is so seamless and gripping that their power is only apparent once the credits roll and regular breathing returns.

TAI stands pretty close to a benchmark I use for judging chills and thrills of the satanic kind, The Exorcist. TAI rubs shoulders with that touchstone without the shock of projectile vomit or the  situation of a child at risk and in torment.

While shock and awe were appropriate in the Exorcist, most of the time of late we are just battered and spattered by things that jump out of the dark with big knives, rotting flesh, psychotic intentions, and silly back stories. So I  delight to find my pulse racing without undergoing those usual assaults from those usual suspects.

Is it worth seeing, renting, buying (by such as have ready money)?

Yes!

Enjoy.",1420934400,14,2537,5.028708133971292

I figured out the ending long before the film got to the big reveal because there's enough hints to help you along the way. But I didn't mind knowing what the twist would be.

6785779,4,B00P2G1O4S,"Atticus Institute may not be an original type movie but it gets big kudos on the acting.  Rya Kihlstedt plays Judith Winstead, a young lady who could have easily been, as one character said, ""your primary school teacher"".  Unfortunately for her and everybody involved, Judith was far from sweet and kind and ordinary.  She was possessed.

Originally a study my psychology doctors studying ESP (think Binkman in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghostbusters/dp/B000PEX1IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghostbusters</a>, but without the comical aspects), Judith was the ""star"" pupil.  Rya's acting was nothing less than superb as she sinks into the void of dementia and demonic.

Originally I had a hard time with this movie.  In fact, I turned it off about half way through.  While somewhat interesting, it failed to hold me captive.  However, I saw it sitting in my queue one morning and it called to me to finish watching it.  I guess I had stopped just before it kicked into overdrive.

The filming is in a documentary style.  Normally I have a problem with these faux documentaries.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B000KDZSA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>&nbsp;took the idea and, in my opinion (because that's what a review is), made it horrible to watch.

This one was put together well. It's a horror movie, so suspend your beliefs before you get into it. When the G-men come in the true terror begins. I give a nod of approval for Julian Acosta's performance as the man in charge (Robert Koep). I encourage viewers to set your expectations low for the predictable  and moralistic themes and embrace the suspense. While it's a huge challenge for a mockumentary possession film to be original and innovative, The Atticus Institute boldly stands up to it. The director,Chris Sparling, may borrow a lot from the obvious influences but he makes up for it with his style and his ability to eke out great performances from the cast. I imagine that there's a lot of negative critiques for this film and they're justified. But don't let them persuade you to skip watching The Atticus Institute. The creepiness factor was high enough to inspire me to write this review. On a final note, I really enjoyed the Nina Kulagina component of the story.

6785789,2,B00P2G1O4S,"Alas, the destruction of this movie is bad acting.  The actress that plays Judith does an excellent job, but doesn't speak.  It is the fools that do that ruin the movie.

The film is approached as a documentary.  So, there are numerous people speaking as though they were part of the experiment.  One is decent.  The actors that are not the narrators are reasonable except for one or two background actors that look like they are fake from the word go.

But the narrators are the most important facet and they leave no sense of legitimacy, destroying what could be a fantastic film.  The concept is great, except that demonic possession is old hat.  If you still believe in the devil after decades of only seeing such nonsense in the movies, then you are likely ready for a psychological study yourself.

Devils, ghosts and zombies are so much foolishness, that they can only be explained as in many horror movies because they are cheap to depict.  Twist a head and hiss, you are possessed.  The special effects are minimal, so the acting has to be good to make anyone buy into the story.

This movie had great potential with a great script fed to horrible actors that just confirm the nonsense in most horror films.  The writers can be great, buf if the cast stinks, then you are left with nothing but ""yeah, right"".",1447804800,,1317,4.572649572649572
6785790,3,B00P2G1O4S,"This is one that I give 1/2 a star to the movie because Amazon doesn't allow for 1/2 star'ing:

The story is one that plays on the conspiracy lore revolving around the scientific experiments done for the military in the late 70's. ""The Atticus Institute"" is framed in a documentary style with faux footage from the actual case involving the study of telekinesis and especially the study of one extraordinary subject- Judy Winstead. The film does pull in the whole concept that these abilities are ""gifts"" from entities that possess the person with supernatural abilities. Something I was also told growing up, by the people in my Baptist Church and the Christian people in my family. It is a pretty cool concept to explore in a horror film. This time around though-the subject is sort of a missed opportunity.

""The Atticus Institute"" stays pretty sterile, and devoid of emotion as it plays out all too familiar themes and heavy stylized formats which permeate the possession subgenre, and the ""mockumentary/found footage"" subgenre as well. Sparling doesn't actually fail at presenting the story, it is a fascinating tale and Judy Winstead offers a truly creepy character, but sadly everything is cookie cutter, done-to-death gimmicks, and ideas. There isn't really a lot of creativity in ""The Atticus Institute"" beyond the initial concept of the military trying to control a demonically possessed person for some twisted warmongering ideology.

The special effects are expected displays of visual parlor tricks mixed with played-out demonic possession material seen time and time again in these films. There are some moments that get creepy, and gory. Some of the early test scenes with Judy jumping through the scientific hoops are nicely done. Unfortunately all the aspects of this are so obvious and expected that there is no real suspense or thrill. It all really has the same quality of effect on the movie goer as those television paranormal documentary series were you know exactly what is about to happen in the recreation because they all but told you so just moments before. ""The Atticus Institute"" doesn't really give itself space to build up for some much needed scary moments-and there was plenty of opportunity for some real thrills.

Overall ""The Atticus Institute"" is one of those mediocre horror films that you can coast your way through if you are just determined to watch it. There isn't any real connection given between the character development and the audience. The horror and chilling elements aren't really scary or affective unless you are 12 and really creeped out by demons and paranormal stuff. The one real show of awesomeness is Judy Wintead, and the way the actress-Rya Kilhstedt portrays her. Unfortunately the framing device and story arc is so done to death, that it becomes a bit boring and you find yourself asking ""why am I watching this?"".",1444867200,,2879,5.042016806722689

""Atticus Institute"" is told as a docu-horror. Characters are interviewed and the story is told via flashbacks. The movie is elevated by the acting of the cast - far beyond what's seen is most found footage movies. But the movie is severely hurt by  having the characters ""tell"" us about the horror they experienced as opposed to ""showing"" us it. Characters repeatedly tell us that Judith's abilities far surpassed what they had ever seen, that they should've known better than to proceed on examining Judith, that Judith's evil permeated far beyond the boundaries of the institute. But we see so little that verifies any of that.

6785818,2,B00P2G1O4S,"If only the description had said the Atticus Institute is actually a mockumentary instead of insultingly tricking viewers into thinking this is going to be a legitimate horror film based on demonic possession, I'd have been prepared.  No mention of being a documentary or mockumentary anywhere.  I just don't get the appeal of horror mockumentaries.  The way they're written makes it look like we're anticipating the actors to suddenly change course and throw in humor in typical sketch comedy routine, so I was often watching Atticus Institute with the expectation that the audience would start laughing any moment.  But they never did.  Instead we're led to believe the exorcism of Rya Kihlstedt is actually real.  Why would the writers keep the joke going even with the knowledge that none of this is real?  Who knows, probably because the well is running dry in the horror movie genre so they needed to cling onto something.

But no, despite knowing this is fictional which immediately removes any horror elements this movie might've had, the writing actually takes the idea that a woman is possessed very seriously.  Like all exorcism films, she's strapped to a chair at some secluded institute, her voice changes, and she gradually morphs into something more demonic before our very eyes.  The thing is, when watching a real documentary, we're watching facts.  We're watching something based on a true story.  A movie like Atticus Institute isn't based on facts- it's intentionally fake.  You can't frighten viewers when it's obvious it's intentionally fake.  It's not the same as watching a regular horror movie.  Yeah it's obvious those are fake too, but they don't mock anything (or if they are mocking, they're doing it in a completely unobvious way and more importantly, they avoid the idiotic documentary concept by 20,000 country miles).  The writing, acting and characters never dumb down the viewer and reveal it's all a big put-on like this ""documentary"" does.  I dunno guys, the documentary mocking concept just doesn't work for me.  I watch films like these laughing.  Am I supposed to laugh?

It's not like I can fault Rya Kihlestedt who is a terrific actress.  She does a great job mocking the supposed real victims who believe they're the work of the devil.  Many many years of similar stories based on actual evidence, all conveniently mocked right here in Atticus Institute.  It's not nice to mock real people who are victims of such a terrible fate, but the writers of the Atticus Institute don't seem to care about that.  The writing also often plays on the shock factor.  Everything's nice and quiet until suddenly Rya either throws up blood, uses her telekinesis skills to move objects, creates earthquake/rattling effects that startle the people in the next room over, is supposedly the reason for all the bad luck occurring with the doctors and their personal lives/families, etc.  But since none of this is based on actual experience and is just mocking documentaries and the real evidence of real victims of the past, I unfortunately wasn't scared.  Just annoyed that the writing would dig a deeper hole for itself by following the Paranormal Activity horror style of jump scares (being exceptionally quiet for the most part until a sudden burst of loudness occurs).  That's mainly the horror that takes place- jump scares.  I certainly wasn't scared that a fictional woman was being controlled by the devil.  Just confused.

The final verdict- don't mock documentaries and try to make a movie out of this horrendous concept.  It doesn't work.  To make matters worse the writing does everything in its power to insult the viewers and make it as believable as possible, even going so far as to give a story build-up on how Rya's character had been acting unexplainably unusual for a while and this mockumentary even provides a conclusion.  All in an attempt to make fun of the real thing and trick viewers into thinking it's based on real facts.  How insulting.",1430870400,,3991,4.968325791855204

6785822,4,B00P2G1O4S,"Now this is what horror film means.  Not slasher film, but horror film.  This manages to deliver a fair amount of creepiness with the least amount of blood Ive seen for some time.

And no, it is not a found footage film.  It is however a pseudo-documentary, presented as if it is an actual account with footage filmed at the institute supplemented by newer interview footage from some of the participants and their family members.

The Atticus Institute was supposed to be an institute for the study of paranormal abilities, rather like the famous Duke University studies which eventually had to move off-campus.  In this case, after a public humiliation, the researchers stumble upon a woman with truly extraordinary abilitiesunlike anything theyve ever seen.  Of course, it turns out thats only because shes possessed.  And when the researchers realize things are getting more dangerous than they would have imagined, they contact federal authorities and next thing, the whole project is taken over by the military who want to know if they can weaponize these abilities.  Trying to control satanic forces rarely turns out well.

Rya Kihlstedt, though not listed as a primary actor (actress), certainly is, as the possessed woman.  She doesnt have to say much; its all about body movements and facial expression.  She gives a convincing depiction of a woman truly tortured by inner demons.  If you want to do a more convincing story, it helps to ground it at some points in fact.  Reference is made to Nina Kulagina, a Russian housewife who claimed to have psychokinetic abilities of the most remarkable kind, and who convinced 40 Russian scientists that she was legitimate.  Later she was proclaimed a fraud and said to have been caught on some occasions using trickery.  Of course, unusual abilities don't necessarily manifest themselves on command, and if you are asked to perform regularly, even if you did have such abilities you might find it useful to supplement them with ruse on occasion.  True or false, she was of interest to the KGB around 1970 and reference is made to her in this movie.

If you are a fan of horror films, youll probably want to have a look.  Within the past year I still preferred As Above So Below, and within the past two years, Chernobyl Diaries is at least as good, but this movie is its own film.  I give it a B.",1430524800,,2349,4.796019900497512

The story line is original and interesting.  Rya Kihlstedt, who plays Judith, does an outstanding job playing a woman who is possessed or is she just in need of some serious medical assistance?

It's starts out as a movie focusing on a group of scientists looking for anyone with true psychic abilities.  Judith is brought to the group by her older sister who can no longer look after her and her bizarre behaviour.  The group thinks they finally have a true case of someone with paranormal abilities in Judith.  But she becomes more difficult to control.  The government gets involved and that's when things really start to happen.  She is considered a weapon of mass destruction.  A threat to the nation and they must get her under control.

6785846,4,B00P2G1O4S,"Another addition to the growing pantheon of found footage horror, The Atticus Institute tells the story of a small private research foundation, led by Dr. Henry West (William Mapother), that is dedicated to investigating possibilities of supernatural or extranormal phenomena - ESP, telekinesis, etc. - through rigorous scientific testing.  The film is set in two time frames, one being the 1970s when the Institue was active (about 80%), and also in 'our' time frame, with interviews of various people involved in the Institute's work, now much older (about 20%).  These interview segments are interspersed documentary-style through the overall film.

In its early years, the Atticus Institute has some mild successes, but nothing to really make people sit up and take notice.  For example, several test subjects trying to influence games of chance are able to consistently raise the chances of a specific card being drawn from about 20% to about 30%.  That sounds like just a coincience, but in one of the interviews segments the doctor running the trials explains how, if it had happened just once it'd be nothing, barely a coincidence, but the fact that the test subject can consistently raise the odds by about 10% is, mathematically, extremely improbable without some kind of 'influence'.  So the team has some interesting numbers, but nothing that's going to convince a skeptic or generate a revolution in scientific thinking..

Enter Judith Winstead (Rya Kihlstedt).  A seemingly normal and non-descript woman, a family member has noticed odd behavior (much of the backstory about the years before Judith came to the Institute, but after she gained her unusual abilities, is left to the imagination; or prequelization) and has heard of the Atticus Institute and thinks they may be interested in Judith's gifts.  After they take this seemingly mild woman to the facility, the family tellingly dooesn't appear or get mentioned very much.

In almost every conceivable kind of test Judith totally blows away every case they've tested before, including precognition, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, etc.  But as the tests continue, sinister aspects of the seemingly normal woman start to appear, leading investigators to have to at least consider that this isn't merely a case of extraordinary abilities, but conceivably of malevolent possession.  The military gets wind of the ongoing experiments, and shows up to 'help'.  The posssibility of weaponizing a case of demonic possession is firm in their minds.  But as we go still further, the malevolent and inhuman aspects of Judith and her powers are seemingly increasing.

The movie has a good concept that's well handled, and provides a few real jolts.  It could have benefited from a slightly longer running time (it clocks in at 82 minutes) to allow certain scenes to play out longer or to build up certain characters a bit more, but this is not a major shortcoming.  One thing that struck me was the vague and inexplicable explanation of just before Judith gained her abilities.  She apparently fell and hit her head (on some ice, I think it was).  That's it.  The fact that it's so mundane and ordinary stands out a bit.  Normally someone who was, for example, scripting a movie would have the origin point be something like 'just after a loved one died in a terrible accident' or 'during the strange lightning storm in the middle of winter'.  The fact that these abilities appeared after something as simple as a fall on the ice doesn't sound 'made up', which makes the whole story about Judith's powers just starting up seem all the eerier.  Another thing occured to me some time after the movie ended, however.  The whole thing is like - ""Uh, she just fell"" - did the family deliberately hide something more dramatic by using a simple everyday ocurence as the apparent catalyst?  The more I think about it, the more it seems that there may be a lot more backstory waiting to be revealed.  Then again, it may be as simple as it sounded.  Not knowing provides points to wonder about.

Without giving too much of the movie's ending away, it is clear from the 'flash-forward' interviews early in the movie that the Atticus Institute has been closed down for quite some time.  So the question going forward into the movie is, what exactly happened in those final days of operations, with the researchers, with the military, and with Judith Winstead?",1424390400,,4401,5.006868131868132

The dramatic elements I mentioned really boil down to man's arrogance.  What happens when men try to control something beyond their comprehension.  THE ATTICUS INSTITUTE was an interesting exploration of that very premise.  Normally in these kinds of movies someone experiences evil and calls a priest.  Here, we see scientists try to understand, and worse than that, control what they encounter.

I admit some of the events portrayed are rather cliche but they are executed well.  This film wasn't saturated with jump scares and over-the-top gore.  It does manage to get under your skin with it's atmosphere of dread and seemingly logical explanations offered by various characters.

I gave this film 4 stars because of how well done the film and story were done.  I had to subtract a star because many of the themes had been done before which took away from the originality.

Suppose that, instead of finding hoaxes or someone who could predict the symbol on a flash card with 5% better accuracy than your average person, they found someone with potent psi abilities.  Suppose those abilities were not the result of a mutation or inborn ability, but of demonic possession.

That is a very compelling point to start from, and the film explores a variety of branching questions.  How does one, for example control a demon?  They put the stock bullet-proof barriers around the possessed and do their best to have a 'controlled' environment, but as the plot unfolds goes on, and numerous coincidences and convenient accidents leave the researchers questioning both the extent and range of the creature's powers, control, safety and even objectivity become something of a joke.

The motivations of the researchers are also constantly called into question.  Why would you want to study a demon?  What possible positive application could its powers have?  While the earlier researchers appear interested in the entity from a scientific point of view, and genuinely interested in the unfortunate host's physical and mental health, the research team sent in by the government had ulterior motives that generally hovered somewhere between sociopathic and outright sinister.

If you are going to watch this movie, which as it turns out i thought was decent, you need to watch it for what it is. What i mean by this is, don't compare it to anything else. It is what it is, and aside from a bit of pacing, shaky cam, and characters that you don't really deeply connect with its not bad.

6785863,4,B00P2G1O4S,"As other users have summed up the movie is about a psychology lab filled with scientist, and doctors researching psychic abilities. After being conned by one participant they come into contact with Judith who is dropped off by her sister. At first they were ecstatic by her abilities, but soon became fearful and contacted the NSA. Then things start to get worse when the NSA tries to weaponize her/it.

Now first, this film is a mockumentary. In other words it is a ""made up documentary"". So if real documentaries aren't your thing then you won't enjoy this despite the supernatural theme.

Second, I really did enjoy this film. I rented it today from Amazon and wanted it to give it a review while it was still fresh in my mind. I was on the fence about renting this movie because of the limited reviews and very vague trailer. But in the end I'm glad I did. This erased the bad taste in my mouth after watching two other terrible ""supernatural"" movies back to back on Netflix.

The Atticus Institute is a film shot like an investigative documentary movie or series like 48 Hours. They use interview segments, ""real"" footage, and still photos throughout. As much as I would of enjoyed seeing more of the ""actual"" footage I thought the movie was put together just fine. The interviews add to the atmosphere, and stop you from yelling at the characters as to why they are still there. One user called this a ""hand holding"" genre which I could only interpret it as meaning ""they walk you through the movie"". Well that's how documentaries work. They want you to believe this is a real case and walk you through the events. Another user compared the ending to ""Paranormal Activity (PA)"" which it is similar but a lot of movies before PA have used that ending.

In conclusion it really is up to you. We all have different taste but if you can tolerate a shakey found footage film. Then you can tolerate a mockumentary.",1422403200,2,1914,4.587719298245614
6785864,4,B00P2G1O4S,Very cool! Love the '70s filming effect.,1422144000,2,40,4.857142857142857
6785865,3,B00P2G1O4S,"Presented in documentary style, the film shows interviews with survivors of the events in 1976 interspliced with file footage of the actual events. It's an interesting concept and story and has a few good moments, but it very much calls to mind similar movies such as Paranormal Activity, especially the ending that borrows heavily from that film.",1422057600,3,347,5.105263157894737
6785866,1,B00P2G1O4S,"It's pouring in Orlando. Listen, I'm half-way. Remember those William Shatner-ified Emergency 911 retellings or Robert Stack stinking up the place in an Unsolved Mysteries re-enactment. A dash of Jon Walsh & a big splash of Discovery Channel drama & a fountain of THOSE MEGA STRANGE/PRE-KIRK CAMERON 70s early Sunday morning XTRA Christian soap moralites(THAT IS IT!).

Look at the  monologues & how they are acted & constructed. Community/cable access theater.  It's so...'Brittany Wrote A Scary Movie in 3rd Period'  C'mon, let's gore this shadoobee up for the win, Wink! This is watching a blowtorch burn cardboard. I swear...when some lady says ""It costs the same to bury a woman as it does a man..."" I'll throw my laptop out of the hotel window.

If you have NEVER, EVER seen a fright flick in your entire life?? 4 1/2 stars. You will absolutely love it.",1421971200,4,859,4.896551724137931
6785867,4,B00P2G1O4S,"I had never even heard of this movie until I saw it on the Amazon Prime Videos!  I've read some of the other people's reviews, but from my point of view, I thought this little-known movie was one of THE most terrifying movies regarding the subject of demonic possession! I say that because without using blood and gore and cheap Hollywood special effects of all kinds that we've all seen, this movie gets you  by drawing you into the story of some normal people trying to prove that paranormal activities DO exist and they do it in a way that I thought was really quite simple, but brilliant, Almost the entire story is told by the people that were involved in this particular incident, 30-40 years later, way ""after the actual event"", but that's what I thought made it so disturbing and scary. You (the audience) are left to your own imaginations and belief systems that we've all been pounded at by other ""big-time Hollywood movies"", such as The Exorcist, The Omen, etc., over and over, but in this movie, you get none of that really and to me, that is what made it so terrifying,disturbing and something I couldn't get out of my head for quite awhile!! So, if you're ready for a well told story about a subject that's been ""done to death"", try this one out because I think you may be surprised at just how affective leaving alot out for the viewer's own interpretation can be just as scary and creepy as having it all there in front of you to see for yourself. I thought this was a really good film!",1421971200,23,1502,4.438405797101449
8686199,3,B00P2G1O4S,A good time filler. This low budget film gets the job done. The story is solid if a little drawn out. The documentary style is good but does not help pacing. Overall the film is a good effort and I watched the whole movie.,1525392000,,222,4.068181818181818

8686205,4,B00P2G1O4S,Good storyline.  Better writing.  Great acting.  The most impressive aspect is the pace of the film and how the writing and actors all work together to keep you right on the edge.  All that worked on this film should hold their head high.

8686207,3,B00P2G1O4S,"This movie had a lot of potential that didn't get fully realized (mostly because so much of the plot met with my reaction of, ""Oh, c'mon, really?!"" when it came to character motivations/actions). However, it's a fun possession movie with a couple of excellent, creepy moments.",1492473600,,276,5.021739130434782
