5404479,1,B00AADAIS6,"This production was TOO HEAVY in SUBTITLES making it very hard to follow.  NOTE:  most of the film was in Italian.,
It was not worth what I paid for it.",1414540800,4,152,4.033333333333333

5404481,1,B00AADAIS6,"It is worst acting that Danny Glover ever stared in. I'll bet, he didn't even read the script before signing a contract to make this horrific movie. DANNY GLOVER had to have been so desperate for a part in any movie. On my watch list, (I will never watch another movie with Danny Glover in it)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1411776000,2,307,4.5
5404482,1,B00AADAIS6,"This is a film about redemption, particularly of two bad men. It starts out as our two bad guys meet on a train and freely open up about each others criminal past. Leonard (Danny Glover) is now a priest. He was a gang leader who killed a man. Davide (Giovanni Martorana) is now a blind man who was in the middle of a poorly scripted mafia war in Sicily with one side headed by the greasy haired Don Mancino (Michael Madsen).

From this film we get these words of wisdom, ""Easy money does not exist,"" and ""Marry a dumb young chick."" Madsen as an American tries to take over Sicily by using ""Remember Troy, the horsie?""

The dialogue was poorly written, so the lines could not be delivered by seasoned actors. It was a very boring film with the flashbacks adding to the ""please get on with it"" attitude I developed watching. The movie seemed to be closer to a failed college experiment, than serious film making. A mafia war film that will be sure to waste 90 minutes of your life.

5 stars if you love half a film in subscripts.

Parental Guide: F-bombs (two languages) brief bed scene, no nudity.",1370649600,,1096,4.410891089108911

Talk about disjointed, trying to follow the plot (if there was one) was impossible or maybe it was so simple I didn't understand it.  Anyway, this was a low budget attempt to make a ""spagetti mob/ muder mystery?"" My wife and I hated it.",1481846400,,315,4.338983050847458

8549083,3,B00AADAIS6,"This really should just be two stars but I like the story, so I give it an okay
There are holes in the script that should of been corrected & some parts looked more like a rehearsal than finished product.
But what really sucked was the open ending. As for the quality of the work it appears to of been underfunded.
I could see this actually being a TV series & maybe this was supposed to be a pitch project to Netflix or Amazon.
However did they really shoot the train scene's  in a soundstage then again on location?",1511913600,,517,4.222222222222222
