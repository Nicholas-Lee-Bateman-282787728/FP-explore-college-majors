8212495,5,B000UAE7R2,the ultimate rush in the csi series. maybe the best csi yet. outstanding cast and flashy sets give this series to be the best csi yet.,1209945600,,134,4.1923076923076925
8212496,5,B000UAE7R2,"Although CSI: Miami is not my favorite CSI show (CSI: NY is), this one rates right up there. David Caruso's overly dramatic style can be a little annoying, especially if you spend several hours at a time watching the shows as I do. He's a little too predictable, but also a lovable character in a strange kind of way. Still, all the shows are just what you would expect from CSI: detailed, suspenseful, and amazing to watch. All in all, an excellent series!",1204156800,,457,4.518072289156627
