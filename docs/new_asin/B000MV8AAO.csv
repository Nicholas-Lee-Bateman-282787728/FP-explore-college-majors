Granted it wasn't the best in terms of special effects but it had some interesting characterizations, and a fair amount of action/adventure.  The subplot was reasonablly unique (pay attention to what the conspiracy theorist says in the beginning and end of the film).  Okay, it wasn't an expensive special effects endeavor like Alien, but it wasn't in the 'time wasted' category either.  We'd watch it again.  Only con was that we found ourselves wishing the main monster matched the cover image.",1463011200,,572,4.978947368421053
8172795,1,B000MV8AAO,"This thing is trash.

I rented it from one of the online rental companies and only got through 40 minuets of it. It reminded me of a bad Adult film, without the sex.",1244073600,2,165,4.0
8172796,3,B000MV8AAO,The monster in this movie is really freaky and scary.  It looks good but most of the movie is about inmates escaping their captors and going to a small town.  They don't show the alien very much at all and isn't that what people want to see in this movie?,1240790400,,255,4.08
8172797,3,B000MV8AAO,"not bad for a low budget movie, but i've seen better. it was okay. worth seeing once. but thats all.",1213660800,2,100,4.05
8172798,1,B000MV8AAO,"I should have listened to the short but sweet review from Gary below.  This movie is simply horrible.

A couple of nice concepts come through at the end, and the final scene before the credits roll looks nice, but getting there is complete torture.

Simply put, there's nothing right about this movie.  The aliens look bad (from an aesthetic and technical perspective), there's absolutely no real atmosphere or tension, and the dialogue makes you roll your eyes.  The sound is horrible; better gun sound effects were routinely used on TV in the 70's.

I'm a big creature nut and that's why I ignored the warnings, took the plunge and paid $3.45 for a used copy.  I wasted $3.45.  Please don't fall prey to any temptation.  This is junk, and not even enjoyable-as-junk junk.  Avoid at any cost!",1191974400,6,793,4.7226277372262775
8172799,3,B000MV8AAO,"An alien craft crashes to Earth in Arizona.  Shortly after the nearby town is deserted.  Meanwhile, a prison transport breaks down and the prisoners manage to escape.  Their plans were to meet someone in the town but there is no one there now.  After a quick look around they run into the first signs of an alien and it tries to eat them.  A strike team has also been sent in to deal with the aliens and soon the survivors run into the prison group.  They must join forces in order to survive.

The aliens are voracious, fast, strong and deadly.  Staying off the menu is not an easy accomplishment.  And if that wasn't bad enough, you can also get infected by them and turn into a violent killer.  The aliens are spreading and they need to be stopped before they spread outside the town.  Is it possible to get out of the town?  How many will survive?  Can the aliens be stopped?  You will have to watch the film to figure it out.

The prison bus idea is one I have been seeing a lot of lately so the moment I first saw the bus I knew what was going to happen.  The aliens were different from what I was expecting but well handled.  The acting was a little better than in many low-budget films but nothing great (just good enough to keep things moving well).  This is not a great movie and not particularly memorable but it is fun to watch and interesting enough to stick with it to the end.  Parts of it make me think there will be a sequel but I am not sure.  If you want a little mindless sci-fi horror fun then there are a lot worse films you could watch.  Check it out.",1182124800,3,1574,4.162790697674419
8172800,1,B000MV8AAO,This movie misses on just about every level. A laugh a minute--but it's not what the filmmakers intended. I can't understand why this piece of trash DVD costs so much. Anything above five bucks for this and you're throwing your money away because ultimatly this disc is going to land on your coffee table as a coaster.,1180656000,7,318,4.5964912280701755
