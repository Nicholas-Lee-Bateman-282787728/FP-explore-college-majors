One prominent notion stood out in my mind after watching ""Cars 2"" - it was the Energizer Bunny on speed, steroids, and any other drug that gives you superhuman endurance. From the opening shot where a British spy operative is communicating oil rig coordinates to suave James Bondesque agent Finn McMissile (voice of the ubiquitous Michael Caine) to the last shot in Radiator Springs where Gomer Pylesque tow truck Mater is hailed as a hero, ""Cars 2"" hits the ground running (or rather, rolling) and almost never stops. Cars zipping around, racing, diving, skydiving, flying, the movie is seemingly an adrenaline junkie's dream. It was exciting, up to a point, then it eventually became too noisy and tiresome - like, some would say, a Transformers movie.

(PLOT SYNOPSIS: on a dare from the boastful Italian Formula One (I guess) race car Francesco Bernoulli (sp?) (John Turturro), superstar racer Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) challenges him to three races in Tokyo, Paris, and London. This secondary plot is just a pretext for McQueen to bring his ""goofy goober"" buddy and mechanic Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) along just so Mater can unwittingly blunder into a Bondian ""Big Oil vs. Alternative Fuel"" spy caper orchestrated by McMissile and his capable young assistant Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer).)

The races and the spy caper both move at Road Runner speed, sometimes parallel, sometimes intersecting where a mysterious villain is eliminating race car participants with an electromagnetic field in a plot to blame their crashes on the alternative ethanol they must use and bolster Big Oil. Yes, I know, it's confusing. Besides the incessant action, you also get meticulously rendered depictions of all three cities and bright, splashy colors (if nothing else, ""Cars 2"" is visually enthralling). You also get a depiction of what the world would be like if sentient cars, buses, helicopters, and ships ran it (Example: Cars must remove their wheels to go through airport security). There's a lot to process in the movie. Maybe too much.

Again, I call ""Cars 2"" Pixar's ""Transformers"" movie because it is noisy, busy, stuffed with colorful characters, locations, weapons, and hardware, and sometimes needlessly complex and hard to follow. In spite of all the action and violence which should have received a PG rating, at least),occasionally I found my attention drifting. When Mater eventually deduces that Axelrod (the alternative fuel mogul) and not the German mastermind (Professor Z) is responsible for the race car sabotages, and explains his reasoning, it seemed half-baked and vague. Some Scooby-Doo mysteries have more coherent explanations. If adults could get confused by all this, I would imagine that young children watching ""Cars 2"" would get bored and tune out completely.

So, did I like the movie? Generally, yes. ""Cars 2"" does maintain Pixar's record for producing ambitious, intelligent movies with important morals (in this case, stay true to yourself and never underestimate anyone, even a country bumpkin). However, the frenetic action and labyrinthine Bond plot unfortunately weigh it down. Nevertheless, there is more good stuff than bad stuff to make ""Cars 2"" a respectable, if not exceptional, addition to Pixar's canon.

P.S.: Actually, it would have been kind of cool to have one of the vehicles be a ""Transformers""-type robot!

3633976,2,B001HN6922,"My family and 4 year old enjoyed the first CARS movie so it was natural that we would want to see CARS2. What a dissapointment. There was way too much violence for young children. I take my child to less than 5 movies per year and only G rated. I'm sorry I wasted our time and money on this one. I had to continually explain the storyline to my child (bad guys vs good guys) due to the shooting/violence. This movie should be rated PG. As far as adult enjoyment, weak storyline. there is so much they could have done to develop characters based on the good foundation from the original CARS movie. This one is an utter failure.",1309219200,21,627,4.277310924369748
3633977,3,B001HN6922,"Even though I think the first Cars is one of the weakest Pixar films, at least it has some really funny moments and a story with more in mind than just blowing stuff up. I don't think we laughed more than a few times with Cars 2. The plot is too complex for younger kids and there is more action than you can or will want to handle. It feels more like a Dreamworks movie than one made by the great Pixar. It's not all bad though. The spy element played like a decent a Bond flick and the animation is of high quality as expected. You know it can't be good when the 5 minute Toy Story short shown before Cars 2 is actually better than movie you paid to see.",1309132800,7,656,3.977272727272727
3633978,5,B001HN6922,"Cars 2 is exciting and action-packed!  I did not expect the fast pace of the movie, but it was a nice surprise that made it even more enjoyable!  I was blown away by the visuals and Pixar's attention to detail.  As with most Pixar films, the details deliver layer upon layer of additional enjoyment.  For that reason, I will be seeing this at least once or twice more before it leaves theaters.

A note to parents: I think Cars 2 should have been rated PG rather than G due to the suspense and danger that go with films that have spy-like themes.",1309132800,9,546,4.313725490196078
3633979,3,B001HN6922,"To be fair, Cars 2 is not a dud. But it's not a hit either. As someone who's loved everything Pixar has heretofore come up with, it pains me to say it, but I think Cars 2 will be remembered as Pixar's first miss. It's one of those films that, if you've seen the trailer, you've already seen ninety percent of what there is to see in the movie itself. The rest, unfortunately, is tedium.

The plot, such as it is, is as follows:  Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) invites his best buddy from Radiator Springs, Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), to accompany him on an international racing event. In Japan, Mater is mistaken for an American spy by two British agents Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) who are investigating a criminal conspiracy involving oil rigs, alternative fuels and a mysterious secret weapon.

Every now and then, a film comes out where you look at it and wonder how it got into production in the first place. You keep thinking why didn't someone in the early stages come out and say ""You know, this is a bad idea. A really, really _bad_ idea."" And so many things about Cars 2 were bad ideas. Taking the story out of the intimate - and uniquely original - setting of Radiator Springs and sending it through Tokyo, Italy and London, which we recognize because they're already so familiar?  Bad idea.  Reducing all of the other residents of Radiator Springs, who were so memorable from the original Cars, to little more than cameos?  Bad idea. Making the movie an action-driven parody of James Bond spy films? Bad idea.  And last but not least, making Mater the center of everything? _Really_ bad idea.

Everything that made the first Cars film so memorable and enjoyable is missing here.  Most particularly Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) who was part of what gave Cars its heart and gravitas. There's no character development in Cars 2, and no heart.  There's just mindless action across dazzling settings, with repeated heavy-handed beatings over the head of _message_:  ""Friends are important!"" and ""Be Yourself!""

If the blame for Cars 2 failing to match its predecessor in quality can be laid at the feet of anyone, Brad Lewis as co-director/writer is probably most deserving of that dubious achievement. Why he was chosen is beyond imagining as his only previous work as a director was on a short video documentary on food and he apparently has no other credits as a writer.  The original Cars, it must be noted, was co-directed and written by Joe Ranft, whose previous work as a writer includes a host of great films as The Brave Little Toaster, Oliver & Company, The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Toy Story and A Bug's Life. And the proof, as they say, is in the pudding.  Mr. Ranft, having passed away in 2005, was unfortunately not available for Cars 2, but you'd think that Pixar would have at least tried to get someone of the same caliber for Cars 2.

Again, Cars 2 not a bad film, not in the strictest sense anyway. On a technical level, the look is both lush and dazzling. But beneath the dazzle, there's just no 'there' there. It's not bad; it's just boring. And because it's a sequel of a very good and enjoyable film, it's also more than a little disappointing.  Recommended only for those who want to see everything Pixar and who have time to kill.",1309046400,217,3333,4.633276740237691
3633980,5,B001HN6922,"Cars 2
Directed by:  John Lasseter & Brad Lewis
Written by:  Ben Queen
Produced by:  Denise Ream
Released in theaters June 24, 2011

My Rating:  '''''

This film is rated G.

Most of the original Cars favorites are back, with tons of fantastic new characters, like Finn McMissle (Michael Caine) and Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro).  This time, McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his motley pit crew take on the entire world (Tokyo, Italy, and London) as they participate in a World Grand Prix sponsored by the new green fuel, Allinol.  As Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) whole-heartedly supports his best buddy, while sometimes embarrassing him with his redneck quirkiness, he is mistaken by two British operatives for an American government contact.  The road gets a little bumpy when Lightning and Mater have a bit of a falling out, and Mater is pulled farther and farther into international espionage.  Finally, Mater must make a critical choice that could save his best friend, even if it means the great junkyard in the sky for him.

When my oldest son was around the age of my youngest son, he would watch Cars over and over all day, every day!  I can probably still recite the entire movie to you, word for word.  To this day, it remains a favorite in our house.

Most, if not all, of the familiar voices have returned for this new motor-powered adventure.  Tow Mater seems to take the lead this time, as he is inadvertently taken for an international spy and tossed right in the middle of a jalopy uprising.  I was pleased to find Mater had more on-screen time, not just because he is a ""southerner"" like me, but also because he is just so darn loveable and funny!

While this film is certainly not short on humor, it is also much more action-packed than its prequel.  The spy cars, even Mater eventually, come fully loaded with automatic grappling hooks, machine guns, and missile launchers.  While the plot of this story was undoubtedly all in great fun and entertainment, even my six-year-old commented on the bombs and guns.  Perhaps it was a little more intense than what some people would prefer.

The graphics were superb, of course.  We did not see the 3D version of the film (I try to avoid these as much as I can!), but the colors popped and the story came to life before our eyes.  The soundtrack is subtle, but fun, including a track from Weezer.  The cast was spot-on.  Michael Caine was the perfect choice for the British spy, Finn McMissle.  I was sad that Doc Hudson was not included in this film (though he was honored near the beginning), but I later learned this was in respect to and in memory of the late Paul Newman.  Other voice actors who were lost prior to the filming of Cars 2 include George Carlin (Fillmore) and Joe Ranft (Red), but these characters remain in the story.

Overall, this film was fantastic, and I know it will join our home movie collection when it is released on DVD and Blu-ray.  My entire family gives it an energetic ""KA-CHOW!""

3633981,5,B001HN6922,"""Cars 2"" is great! This is how the story goes: Star racecar Lightning McQueen and the incomparable tow truck Mater take their friendship to exciting new places when they head overseas to compete in the first-ever World Grand Prix to determine the world's fastest car. But the road to the championship is filled with plenty of potholes, detours and hilarious surprises when Mater gets caught up in an intriguing adventure of his own: international espionage. Torn between assisting Lightning McQueen in the high-profile race and towing the line in a top-secret spy mission, Mater's action-packed journey leads him on an explosive chase through the streets of Japan and Europe, trailed by his friends and watched by the whole world. Adding to the fast-paced fun is a colorful new all-car cast that includes secret agents, menacing villains and international racing competitors.

The voice cast led by Larry The Cable Guy (as Mater) & Owen Wilson (as Lightning McQueen) is great. The directing by John Lasseter & Brad Lewis (both of them co-wrote the story) is great. The story by Lasseter, Lewis & Dan Fogelman & the screenplay by Ben Queen is great. The music by Michael Giacchino is great. The art direction by Jay Shuster is great. The animation and visuals are excellent.

This is a great sequel to one of the biggest animated movies of 2006 and of recent memory. This is another hit for Pixar & Disney. This is one of the best movies of the summer, so far. This is one of the best animated films of the year, so far.",1308960000,8,1519,4.771863117870723

""Cars 2: The Big Bomb""
(Pixar, 2011)
----------------------------------------

Let me start by saying that I am a huge, huge Pixar fan -- Monsters, Inc., Toy Story, Wall-E: Love 'em! But I just saw this film in the theater with my family and I HATED IT. Indeed, I would rank it among my all-time least favorite movies, alongside ""Jade,"" ""Showgirls,"" ""Poetic Justice"" and ""The Adventures Of Milo And Otis."" (I actually walked out on three of this five: ""Cars 2"" and ""Milo And Otis"" I had to suffer through because I was with my kid...)

So what's wrong with ""Cars 2""?  The short answer is that it's just not a very good movie.  It's loud, frenetic, full of an unstoppable avalanche of leaden exposition and endless yammering, the plot is simultaneously predictable and hard to follow and -- most importantly -- it lacks the genuine emotional core that makes most Pixar films so great. The first Cars movie had a similar problem - can we really care about anthropomorphic automobiles? - and while the original film made a decent effort at building believable characters, this sequel completely fails. It's all about the action, and the strained attempts at humor or clever dialog simply fall flat: I never laughed at anything or cared about any of the characters. On the plus side, the graphic design is impressive: the visuals of London, Paris and Monte Carlo (as well as the desert landscape of the original film) are stunningly rendered.  But without a good script, who cares? Eye candy isn't enough to make a good movie; also the 3D effects weren't very impressive: regular old 2D would be enough.

Of course there are lots of car chases and racing scenes, and if you're really into cars -- NASCAR, Hot Wheels and that sort of thing -- I suppose you'd dig this film. But I thought it was a dud.  One of Pixar's few bum notes. Oh, well.  I liked the trailer for their next flick, ""Brave.""  Let's hope for the best. (Axton)",1308873600,18,1964,4.769911504424779
3633983,2,B001HN6922,"I thought I'd hate this film. To my surprise, I didn't hate it -- I detested it. It is Pixar's first unequivocal artistic bomb.

It's difficult to describe just how awful ""Cars 2"" is. It's continuously loud and noisy -- there's barely a moment for the viewer to pause and collect his wits. This isn't helped by the hyper-kinetic editing, which sometimes leaves one wondering exactly what's going on. The story itself is a shallow spy caper, with almost no interesting interactions among the characters. Though I wanted to leave after 30 minutes, I stuck with it. I left the theater feeling I'd been assaulted. As I write this, I still haven't fully recovered.

In case you didn't know, ""Cars"" has been Pixar's big money-maker. It's that odd animated film that appeals to boys, and they pester their parents for paraphernalia. It seems likely that ""somebody"" got to John Lasseter and ""suggested"" he make a sequel to rake in more money from ""Cars"" chotchkes. He foolishly did. ""Cars"" seems Pixar's answer to ""The Mummy"" -- a perfect example of how NOT to make an exciting, involving movie. As Unca Walt would have said... ""No heart"".

Much of the blame can be laid at the script, which is little but dialog. Mr Queen (no relation to the car) should take lessons in screen writing -- from Brad Bird, perhaps.

There is /one/ genuinely clever/witty sequence in the film, when Mater uses a Japanese lavatory. There's also an incredibly vulgar sexual joke, which will probably go over your kids' heads -- and yours, as well. Several cars are ""killed"" (by crushing or buring out their engines), and the overall intensity is really not suitable for small kids. A mild PG would be a more-appropriate rating.

Rating aside, I urge parents NOT to take their kids to this film. It is such a loud, noisy, irritating, POINTLESS film that it cannot do anything but pervert your child's taste for ""good"" films.",1308873600,23,1894,4.762195121951219
3633984,4,B001HN6922,"This movie was a complete surprise when they announce it. While I like the first Cars, I never knew of someone who wanted a sequel for the film. Anyway, Pixar released Cars 2 and while it may not be as good as previous Pixar efforts is still great entertainment.

The plot is fairly simple. Lightning McQueen is now a racing star and is challenged to race in the World Grand Prix. This race takes him and his best friend Mater to different locales such as Tokyo, Porto Corsa and London. Meanwhile, Mater is mistaken as an american spy by british spy Finn McMissile who is trying to stop a complot that is taking place in the race. Of course, Mater being Mater, a lot of funny moments appear but also action, adventure and of course racing. This film is a great action adventure but it fails in character development. My major qualm is that Pixar shift the leads by giving Mater the spotlight. While I like Mater, I like him better in small doses and having him being in the center of everything is somewhat exhausting. Another thing is that all the characters that we knew and love from the first film mostly appear in cameos. On the plus side, the pacing of the film is excellent, Finn McMissile is a great new character, the action sequences are breathtaking and of course the animation is stellar putting all the competitors to shame.

Cars 2 may be the weakest Pixar film to date but is still an enjoyable ride.

Video & Audio
Cars 2 continues the excellent trend of Disney of releasing amazing transfers. Cars 2 looks absolutely spectacular in HD. Detail, clarity, contrast and colors are amazing and the picture is completely clean and immaculate. You will be amazed as how good the animation is in this transfer.

Likewise, the 7.1 DTS-HD MA is absolutely bombastic. Clarity and directionality are spot-on. Perfect sound.

Bonus Material:
This is a very disappointing part of the disc. This BD only comes with three bonus features:
An audio commentary by director John Lasseter that is always fun to hear.
The TS short Hawaiian Vacation that is great
A new Mater short called Air-Mater that is fun.

A DVD copy is also included

That's it, nothing more is included. If you want more bonus material you'll have to buy the five disc set that adds a BD 3D, a second BD with more bonus features and a Digital Copy. It's a shame that Disney is forcing us to buy a set that includes a disc most of the consumers don't care about or can't reproduce it. This makes me hate 3D a little more than I already do.

Closing Thoughts
Cars 2 has some weaknesses but overall is still a solid effort from Pixar. It is not by any means TS3 but is still an enjoyable film. This BD features truly amazing video and sound but the bonus features are lacking. Still this comes Highly Recommended.",1308873600,,2779,4.532934131736527

3634638,5,B001HN6922,"We've had this movie for a while now, we initially purchased it for our daughter, but it quickly became one of our son's all time favorites.  Because he's non-verbal with only a few word approximations, and on his speech device he usually only wants to request things he wants, and only occasionally tell us what his emotional state is.  And, as many a person finds out, if you ask him to say hi to them his usual response is ""no,"" so I'm going to have to give you what I, as his mom, think may be the most likely reason he loves this movie so much.  Because it has far more plot then he usually has any sort of interest in.  It's all about Mater, and most of this movie involves a plot line about Mater.

Mater is his own kind of cool, but as Lightning's discomfort indicates in the early stages of the movie, probably not cool by the standards of many of the actual ""cool"" kids of the cars world.  He doesn't keep his paint job looking nice, he's missing parts, he's covered in dents, he's socially awkward, frequently says things that are not quite appropriate for the occasion, and he sometimes does gross things.  And yet, he unwittingly saves the day and gets a chance to have the girl, which are things that aren't as often shown happening for characters with Mater's type of ""cool.""  I imagine Mater is pretty easy to relate to for a child who is doing the very best they can, but because of challenges beyond their control, be it Autism or genetic disorders causing intellectual disability or whatever, just can't quite fit in.  Maybe they are like my son, and don't understand the basic rules society operates under.  Maybe they can't handle the way stylish clothes feel on their bodies. Maybe they're just not sure how to talk comfortably with others.  And maybe they are like Mater, who is shown as being viewed as less intelligent then those around him, to the point where one of the other characters mentions that he's doing a great job acting the part of the fool (because this character just assumed, I'm guessing, nobody could actually be that awkward or seemingly unintelligent, etc. therefore it must be an act.).

This is the reality of many special needs kids, they are definitely their own kind of cool just like Mater, and they want to feel like they can save the day and get the girl or the guy.  And I think that's why my son likes Mater and he loves this movie.  Mater's silly (and my son loves silly), he's not perfect, other people laugh at him (and unfortunately he knows what that is like as well), and yet, Mater still saves the day.  He's the only one in the end who figures out correctly who the bad guy is.  I know some people feel like the spy plot doesn't work.  But I love that this movie makes Mater the hero, because I think Mater is a character that many kiddos with specialized needs can relate to.  And they need to see that characters/people who don't look or act perfect can still do heroic things, and so can they.  Mater's his own kind of cool, just like my son, and so is this movie.",1504742400,3,3030,4.40754039497307

This film was so poorly orchestrated, it completely downplays actual social interaction and uses pigeon-holed notions to describe the new story arcs of our once beloved tow truck/racecar duo. I just see this drivel as a bunch of lame sound bites and wasted ideas.
At first I was delighted to see a turn towards the realm of spy movies, however this addition simply segregated the film into Mater's a-plot of being a spy and Owen Wilson learning how to make a friend, for the second time!
I could go on for so long describing how many problems there are in this turd of a movie, and at times I was truly puzzled at the fact I was actually viewing a movie because it felt like a horrid fever dream.

After re-watching some of the Disney films of the late 80s/90s, I had a greater appreciation for the orignal Cars, as it was not as violent and had a good message. This sequal should have never made it past the Pixar story board phase.

[rest of review contains spoilers]

What should not have been in this movie:
-Violence (cars getting crushed / die]
-Political undertones with the alternative fuel
-Doc Hudson not in this because he died between movies???
-Mator being 10x more annoying than the first movie

The world tour was fun. I liked going to Italy with Luigi, but the rest of the movie was very lacking. The plot was poor and seemed to be made for Disney to have more merchandising with the Cars characters. Overall, poorly executed and I am sad I wasted money on this. We watched it once and haven't watched it again. By the time my son is old enough for this plot, he will have outgrown Cars.",1496620800,,1032,4.4787234042553195

I found this 2nd story of Cars to be cute and very enjoyable. We as a family all enjoyed every minute of it. I have seen in other reviews how it has been compared to James Bond, but I myself don't see how. It was well written, flowed well, and had enough depth to keep me entertained form beginning to end. I originally bought this just to ad another 3D film to my 3D line-up but found myself pleasantly surprised at how well this story really is. I have always enjoyed Pixar movies and this one did not disappoint. There are a few scenes with a little bit of violence in them and some very mild name calling, but nothing I would keep any of the younger crowd from viewing. And as for the 3D, well it is pretty decent, not spectacular, but there again it is not poor either. It always seems that animated films carry over quite well into 3D and this was no exception.
 All in all I would have to say that this is a great animated Pixar film that the ENTIRE family would enjoy. And you can feel safe enough to let the little ones watch it too without any fear of too much violence or bad language.",1491091200,8,1236,4.233050847457627

3635252,2,B001HN6922,"As an adult, I am a big fan of the original Cars movie and now my two-year old twins are as well. I had been hesitant to watch the second one because I loved the first so much, especially the charm of Radiator Springs. I was quite disappointed in Cars 2 and not for the reasons I was expecting. I was shocked at the amount of violence and weapons used in this film - especially the line, ""Lightening McQueen must be killed!""  My twins are too young to understand what is going on at this point, but this movie will be put away and I'm not sure when/if I will get it back out again. Such a let down after how wonderful the story was in the first movie, and now this one is full of shoot outs, bomb threats, etc. I sure hope Disney/Pixar gets their act together for Cars 3.",1490659200,,771,4.072368421052632

My daughter loved Cars and I did too. Really entertaining movie with fun and funny characters with some positive messages in it. The ""darkest"" character being Chic Hicks who is simply a self centered schmuck. I had no qualms about letting her watch this.

Although Cars 2 is also rated ""G"" it is in stark contrast to it's predecessor. It has a dark feel to it and clearly inspired by ""James Bond"" movies. It includes a lot of gun violence and the bad guys are instructed to ""kill him! And some characters are even killed off. There is also some mild name calling.
Don't get me wrong, as an adult, I thought it was entertaining and I've even watched it more than once. Just know going in that it is definitely more ""mature"" than the first. Had I know beforehand, I likely would have put this one on hold for a later day.

3636529,4,B001HN6922,"Good sequel. Our son enjoys it and we do too. I will say that it's much darker than the original; even some cars dying.
I really appreciated that they decided not to bring back Doc Hudson, I assume out of respect for Paul Newman who died in between the first movie and this one. No one is a suitable substitute for Paul Newman, so I think they made the right choice here. The storyline is quite different with an espionage theme, and we're introduced to some great new characters including Finn McMissle, and Francesco Bernoulli.

I'd say for 5 yrs and up its probably fine, but under 5 could cause some nightmares or some odd questions.
It's more like James Bond type story line but with Cars characters.  Some of the humor is more adult than the original Cars.
Some language I wouldn't want my kids to use and definitely a good bit of violence - animated violence, but still.

3636649,5,B001HN6922,"I'll stay out of the argument about what it's appropriate to show your kids, as I only allowed to watch the Disney Channel as a kid and eagerly looked forward to staying with a babysitter so I could watch the ""cool"" cartoons the other kids watched like. I also happen to think that no one should show something to their kids just because it's by Disney/Pixar and rated G, but I digress.

I watched this film right after the first a few days ago, and I'm again impressed by it in absolutely every way. Pixar managed to keep the world and characters from the first film, and create a film with a COMPLETELY different theme and feel. For anyone who thought the first Cars film was too slow, there's more action in the first half hour of this film than the whole of the first Cars combined. The jokes, the camera-work, the visual fidelity (WAAAAY more color this time around), and the variety of characters and settings have all been cranked way up to 11. There isn't really much of a story aside from again one of friendship and finding your usefulness in a world you don't understand, and sticking by your friends, but that doesn't matter because there's so many thrills to be found.

From a design viewpoint this might be the greatest Pixar film ever, with more incredible gadgets and clever uses for them than any other Pixar film I've ever seen. Literally this film keeps your eyes glued to the screen just to see what crazy visual gag or feat you will see next.

Parents will want to tread lightly if they're showing this to a kid who should be playing with large building blocks and coloring books instead of watching TV, but just about everyone else who likes their cartoons action-packed and filled with motion, color, and cleverness with love this film.

And yes, there's some fridge-horror when you realize that every one of those cars that gets zapped, explodes, or is thrown into the sea is DEAD! ....Shudders....",1468195200,7,1922,4.594752186588921

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

We have the toys, the books...and of course now the movies.  Cars 2 is my 3 year old's current favorite movie.  The fact that this comes with the movie in every format is wonderful.  We have a digital copy (great for airplane rides on the Ipad), a DVD (great if we're on a road trip in the car) and the Blu-ray (great at home!).  We don't have a 3D player, so we haven't tested that format.  The quality is great and what you get for the money is fantastic.

The movie itself has had some critical reviews, but all 4 of us enjoy it more than the original Cars.  Lightning McQueen goes on a world racing tour and brings Mater along.  British secret agents are convinced Mater is a spy, and they enlist his help to bring down a ring of bad guys who are attacking cars on the racing circuit.  It's Cars meets James Bond, with a lot of sweet, cute, funny, clever, exciting and action packed moments mixed in.  This is one movie the adults in the house don't mind watching more than once.

3637990,2,B001HN6922,"The idea of Pixar making an animated film that humanizes automobiles may
have first seemed an odd choice when the original Cars film premiered in 2006,
but audiences seemed to have immediately fallen in love with its family-friendly
testimonial to heartland America, Nascar and the towns and tourist attractions
that used to line Route 66.

Unfortunately, Cars 2 retains none of the charm of its predecessor.  In fact,
it's an utter, complete mess of a film that somehow gets turned into a loud,
complex shoot-em-up spy thriller that completely ignores all the elements of
what makes a great Pixar movie including intriguing story, character development
and relationships that invoke some sort of emotional investment by its audience.

This time around, the film centers upon two sub stories.  The first involves
Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who agrees to participate in the championship
World Grand Prix race against a Italian Formula One Francesco Bernoulli
(John Torturro),  The second involves the good-hearted Tow Mater (Larry the
Cable Guy) getting cluelessly involved in a spy ring headed up by British agent
Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and love interest Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer)
who face off against the villainous monocle-wearing weapons designer Professor
Zndapp (Thomas Kretschmann).

One would think that filling the screen with colorful racing cars and fast-edited
action scenes would hold the interest of Pixar's target audience.  However,
somehow the story gets totally bogged down with over-the-top violence and jokes
that mostly aim more towards adult audiences than kids (though there is the inclusion
of un-warranted toilet humor).  In essence, Pixar has taken the focus away from its
lovable characters and put it towards a complex plot that adds to much weight
to the film's overall enjoyment.

Disney has always been noted for its first-rate transfers and this one is no
exception.  The pristine transfer allows for the film's beautifully animated cars
to show off their shiny clear-coats. The pure digital transfer shows an unparalleled
level of sharpness that brings out deep rich rich textures within the animation.
Colors are stunning here, particularly in the Tokyo race sequences where brilliant
neons dazzle the eyes.  There are absolutely no flaws to be found here.

My biggest complaint outside of the film's plot, is its 3D presentation.  Like
the story, it seems to be mostly ineffective and all over the map offering
varying degrees of depth from scene to scene.  While the process does manage
to add realism and make the film somewhat more immersive, one could easily
argue that the 3D adds no real value to this film at all.  Most of the scenes seem
quite flat, offering a minimal amount of depth.  The level of depth seems to open
up in town shots of Radiator Springs, Paris, and along the winding roads of the
Italian countryside.  In fact, it isn't until 3/4 of the way through the film during
a scene inside the London clock tower that one gets the sense that the filmmakers
were making good use of the format with their placement of various objects.  This
leads to one of the biggest arguments I have been making against 3D as of late....
why don't filmmakers make better use of the format?  Theaters and Home
Entertainment companies are charging a premium to watch a film like Cars 2
where there is absolutely no payoff for the audience.  With all the props at
the filmmakers disposal, why couldn't some WOW factor be interjected into
the film?  How much more enjoyable would a film like this have been if objects
flew out towards the audience.  Isn't this what makes 3D what it is?  Instead,
Cars 2 keeps all its action within the confines of the screen.  There is nothing
of WOW value here except perhaps a few fenders attempting to poke out
beyond its boundaries.  As I sat and watched, I couldn't help but be aggravated
over the fact that people paid good money to see a film like this in 3D and
probably walked away extremely dissatisfied.

The film has a rather punchy 7.1 DTS-HD track, downconverted to
5.1 on my system.  Viewers will find themselves immersed in 360-degree
audio that places them in the middle of the action.  A great example
of this is the race sequences where revving engines dash across
the channels with a gratifying amount underlying bass while the surrounds
come alive with the sounds of roaring crowds.  Dialogue remains stiffly
in the center channel as the surrounds give a wealth of support for
the film's effect noises which are well placed throughout with a nice
sense of directionality.  Michael Giacchino, who has written scores
for films like Star Trek (2009), Ratatouille, Up and Super 8 provides
a soundtrack that is not only mostly forgettable, but easily gets lost
amidst all the noise of the film.

Cars 2 arrives as a 5-disc combo set comprised of 3D Blu-ray,
2D Blu-ray, Blu-Ray Bonus, DVD and DIgital Copy packaged in
lenticular packaging.

The 3D disc includes the short Air Mater in 3D, which is a
sort of light-natured story about Tow Mater becoming part of
the Falcon Hawk squad while giving us an introduction to the
upcoming Planes series.  The 3D is adequate here, giving us
nice depth, but nothing eye-popping.

The 2D Blu-ray and DVD disc also offers Air Mater as well
as the theatrical short, Hawaiian Vacation.  A Director's commentary
is offered along with the film feature.  The Blu-ray bonus disc
offers interactive access to deleted scenes, documentaries,
animation and more from different locations in the movie.

Cars 2 completely runs out of gas, failing to connect to its audience
on any level.  Furthermore, it's one of those films that could have
possibly been saved by being a satisfying 3D experience, but alas,
even fails at that.

Only true fans of the series will appreciate the film.  I would expect
kids will quickly become bored by the film's complex storyline.  This
film certainly should not be considered for a blind purchase based on
expectations from the original film.  Though at the time of this review,
there was only a $7 difference in price between the 2D and 3D offerings,
I am uncertain whether the extra expense offers a better viewing experience.",1453075200,,6192,4.9602713178294575

As a very, very large Disney and Pixar fan, who knowingly and willingly spends thousands a year buying tickets and merchandise, I more than dislike this movie.
Other than the torture and death scene, which was completely unnecessary, the whole movie being about Evil ""Big Oil"" and the horrible fossil fuels was just too much. They couldn't even get creative with the names? Big oil? Really?

For all I  know I could be searching for that one thing that accurately paints why its not as good as the first, but it could be a number of little things that brings Cars 2 down. If you watch this film you might be asking your self the same things. Is it that is lacks the heart of the first movie, or that the jokes were a little too on  the nose, or maybe that the filmmakers decided that Larry the Cable Guy's ""Tow Mater"" needed more screen time without realizing that Larry is best in small chunks.",1448323200,,632,3.9606299212598426

He's a little over two, but very progressed for his age so most Disney movies are just fine for him.  Cars 2 is not.  The story-line is pretty advanced and more complex than the first Cars and there are some pretty violent scenes that disappointed my wife and me (e.g. the scene where the bad guys torture the American spy car then kill him).  It's probably a better movie for older kids, so our review is biased based on my son's age.

That being said, I can confidently say this is their weakest product. In tone and execution, Cars 2 is not like the original, which it should be noted, is also one of their weakest films.... Cars 2 is not as funny, charming, insightful or entertaining as the original. It seems they may have latched on to the marketing and merchandising possibilities here. Or maybe they figured the same kids who loved Cars needed a more grown-up storyline to follow 5 years later. From the get go this one is more violent and even occasionally traumatic. Machine guns, expositions, bombs, and a heat producing laser camera; all weapons of destruction, are prominently featured. As are large war ships; heavily armored and housing missiles and torpedoes. So is an angry cabal of Lemon cars, and a sub-plot of big oil versus clean energy/renewable electricity.

Lighting and Co. are back, save Doc and (kind of) Fillmore (Paul Newman and George Carlin, RIP). But Tow Mater is the lead in this, and highlights this opportunistic and failed story. Mater is, like the other characters, a vehicular anthropomorphic archetype. Cars was humorous in it's creativity of these types, but in Cars 2 Mater is overtly the buffoon, only to be revealed as the wise fool. Actually, the wise, Southern-Hick fool, which is tiring to say the least.

Perhaps the immensely creative and smart artists at Pixar should get a mulligan here. That's only fair. But John Lasseter, the head of Pixar wrote and directed this, and could have probably made whatever film we wanted to, so it is considerable to wonder why this was made and where it went wrong....",1443225600,,1737,4.845117845117845

3638468,5,B001HN6922,It's a movie for children. All of you adults giving your movie reviews on a kids movie need a psychologist. This isn't Shawshank Redemption. Mater isn't going to win an Emmy. He's not real. He's a car.,1440633600,,201,4.45945945945946
3638489,1,B001HN6922,"Pixar blew it with this one. They shove the political agenda that Big Oil is evil. That's the entire plot. The bad guys are cars that run on gasoline (lemons, clunkers) who want alternative fuel banned so they plan to kill all the cars who use ""green fuel.""

There's no character growth in Cars 2, no one learns a lesson. Lightning is cruel to Mater. If that's not enough, there's violence in every scene: guns, lasers, missiles, bombs, explosions, spies, and a torture scene. You're also treated to several death scenes and a few near-death scenes. Mater nearly gets blown up when the bad guys plant a bomb on him. Other cars are blown up while the bad guys chant, ""kill him!"" A few bar scenes and alcohol use. Inappropriate adult jokes such as where one car commenting on how cute another car is says, ""I need some coolant!""

3638716,4,B001HN6922,"It seems that when it comes to Pixar's film Cars people fall into two camps.  You either love it or hate it.  I happen to be in the love it camp, so you can imagine how much I've been looking forward to Cars 2.  It's a fun film that kids and their parents will enjoy together.

Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is looking forward to enjoying his off season in Radiator Springs.  But then he gets talked into signing up for the first ever World Grand Prix.  This event is being sponsored by Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard) to show off his new Allinol biofuel.

Lightning invites his best friend Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) along for the three race tour which will have stops in Japan, Italy, and England.  He soon begins to regret that when Mater's lack of sophistication causes some embarrassing scenes.

But then Mater accidentally gets caught up in international intrigue.  Someone is trying to sabotage the World Grand Prix, and spies Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) think Mater is the key to figuring out what it is and stopping it.  Are they right or will Mater blow it again?

All the characters from Radiator Springs make at least a cameo appearance here with one notable exception.  In memory of Paul Newman, they wrote out his Doc Hudson character as well, although they gave them both a very nice tribute early in the film.  In fact, if you pay attention there are lots of nice nods to the original film and a couple of other Pixar films that add to the fun.

And make no mistake about it, this film is fun.  The laughs come fast and furious, although as fast as the plot.  As with the first film, there are lots of fun twists on the humans are cars thing, especially during a montage early on in Tokyo.  On top of that, this movie is definitely spoofing spy films, so that provides plenty of laughs.

Then there's Mater.  He is his normal goofball self and provides lots of laughs all by himself.  As much as I love him, a little of him can go too far, and at times I got a tad burned out on his antics.  Part of that is because I don't find humor in someone repeatedly embarrassing themselves.  Fortunately, the movie redeems that by the end, and I think I will enjoy that aspect more on repeated viewings.

The pace of the film is just a bit too fast.  Between the races and the spy story, there is really too much here.  A couple of slower scenes to relax and take it all in would be nice.

As long as I'm talking about what would have been nice, I missed the Radiator Springs gang.  Now don't get me wrong, I like sequels that expand the world of the original and don't just rehash the first plot, so I appreciate that about the film.  But I also like to see characters I loved from the first one, and many of those characters don't have much to do here.  There scenes are memorable, however, and I felt they made a great impact when they were involved.

Now I'm beginning to sound like I didn't enjoy this film with my nitpicks, and that's exactly what they are.  Overall, this film was lots of fun.  I've already mentioned how much I laughed at the almost constant humor.  I now have a goal in life.  I want to be Finn McMissile when I grow up.  He's just too cool for words.  The moral of the movie, which isn't about energy conservation but about accepting others (and yourself) for who they are, is spot on.

As always, Pixar turns computer animation into an art form.  No other studio creates a world as beautiful as Pixar does.  Yes, it's obviously animation, but there are a couple shots that are breathtakingly beautiful.

And the voice cast is great.  You forget you are listening to human actors and get lost in the world of the cars.

There is a short before the movie starts, the first in a proposed series featuring the Toy Story gang.  In this film, the gang works together to give Ken and Barbie a great time when they miss hitching a ride on Bonnie's Hawaiian Vacation.  I dare anyone who loves those movies not to smile at it.

Because of the spy parts of the story, this one does have more action and danger than the first movie, including some gun fights and other stuff.  I'm a little surprised it didn't get a PG rating since it seems a little extreme for a G movie.  Still, I doubt most kids will be bothered by what they see here.

Yes, I have some nitpicks with this film, but overall I really enjoyed it.  Cars 2 may not be Pixar at their best, but it is still a movie that the entire family will enjoy from start to finish.",1432252800,,4512,4.338516746411483

3638888,1,B001HN6922,"My 4 year old son LOVES the movies Cars, Plane and Planes Fire and Rescue.  He has been a Cars movies lover since he was 2.  So my husband and I figured he would also enjoy watching Cars 2.  It was from this movie that I learned, the hard way, I must view (as much as possible) movies/tv shows/etc. well before I allow my child to watch it.  Cars 2 has many scenes during which time the vehicles fight and/or use weapons against each other.  Each of these scenes clearly depicts instances when a character is trying to attack, harm and wound another character.  Call me traditional or conservative, but I don't think this type of action is appropriate for children.  So anyone reading this has a little understanding of me, I am a California raised, open minded, rather liberal woman.  I am an educator and have seen firsthand how exposure to violence can negatively impact children's behavior and levels of empathy for their peers.  When cartoon characters, who my child likes to watch and emulate during play, use violence as a means to solve problems, I find that counterproductive to the overall message we, as parents, try to teach our children.  We try to educate our kids to use their words, not their fists.  We encourage them to seek adult assistance, or use positive peer pressure when another child is exhibiting negative or maladaptive behavior.

I am extremely disappointed in Disney for having made a movie like this and then rating it a G-rating.  Again, this lesson has taught me to preview shows before I let my son watch.",1428451200,2,1539,4.655555555555556

After seeing it more than 50+ times with him and playing with all of the die set cars he has from the first Cars movie, he has plenty of cars from Cars 2 and Car Toon: Mater's Tall Tales as well. I try to protect my son from violence and guns in particular, but Cars 2 seems to be based around all of the things I try to protect Alex from, guns and violence.

Nor do I have a computer that can hook up to these devices. My android cannot play itunes either. Lots of complications that someone out there needs to integrate into non itune playing devices. Digital Copy is great if you have a computer that can play it. All in all, it would have been great if this came with Ultraviolet then I could have played it on the big screen via the vudu app.

The 3D in Blu-ray was the main reason I bought the movie and it is awesome. The Blu-ray and DVD are awesome also, because when the grandchildren come I can play it on the blu-ray or an older dvd player, especially when there is an argument as to what to watch, I can put Cars 2 one device while playing Cars 1 in another device.

The violence, and darkness, and fire made them both cling to me.  We turned it off after a few minutes.  I watched it later by myself to see if the whole movie is the same.  T

The theme/ plot of the movie they would not understand.  Kids don't understand that the violence is only pretend even in a cartoon.  They talk things as real because they are too young to understand what is real or not - which is why they should not be exposed to a lot of games and movies like this.

While it is not a movie that will scar them for life, Cars 2 certainly is not a movie designed for the same age group as the original Cars movie. There is one particular scene (SPOILER ALERT for those who have still not bothered with this movie) in which one of the antagonists tortures one of the ""good"" spy cars until the good car literally explodes...which for a sentient car means DEATH. Specifically, aggravated murder. For a supposed feel-good kids movie, that particular scene was particularly gruesome.

Not recommended for anyone under the age of 8; if older than 8 the movie is okay but certainly not worthy of being called a ""sequel"" to such a charming predecessor.",1404000000,,787,4.702898550724638

In its attempt to be fresh and combine elements of spy movies, crime/mystery movies, westerns, and comedic films, it jumps around a lot.  He did like the fact that the racers came from a lot of different countries, and that became a springboard for exploration in geography and other cultures.

Highly recommend.,1394409600,,343,4.375
3639920,1,B001HN6922,"I didn't think I'd be a fan of the first Cars movie. I thought of it as a boy movie, or a kid movie... maybe the first Pixar movie that I went in with doubts about...

... but in the end, I was won over. Cars (the first movie) was fun, touching in all the right places, and classy in a way I didn't expect given the initial premise.

Cars 2 on the other hand, takes everything I liked in the first movie, and smashes it to pieces.

Let's start with the things that really bother me (and this is coming now as not just a viewer, but a parent):

1. I like Pixar movies because usually, I can depend on them to be less violent than other movies (even compared to other Disney movies). There isn't any murdering-of-the-parents in movies like Up, Monsters, Inc, Wall-E... and that's something I really appreciate, now that I have two toddlers who want to imitate everything they see... This one however has cars trying to blow each other up (yes, we're murdering cars, not people, but still, it's with intent and malice, and no, I don't really want to explain why the ""naughty"" car is trying to blow up the other cars to my toddler). It has guns, it has... all sorts of things most of the other Pixars are good about either not having, or at the very least, not emphasizing...

2. The plot just... meanders and then some. Several times during the movie, I paused it to see how much more there was, thinking: just how long can this movie possibly be? (we go through various cities for the races, and it seems to drag on unnecessarily in order to have cameos in the form of locations, etc

3. Less of the characters you like (say, Lightning or Sally or Doc -- though the latter possibly because of Paul Newman's passing) and more of the characters that are truly irritating (for example, Mater) being truly, truly exasperating...

Some of the artwork was great. Some of the puns and clever-ness was also, first rate. BUT sandwiched between a terrible plot (even if you take it as a James Bond wannabe), a too-long run-time, and flat jokes... it's just not worth the money. This may be the first Pixar movie I won't be watching a second time!",1394409600,,2134,4.401015228426396

there are 3 aspects I like:

1. animation and sound effects are great - especially when they go to different locations; the Italian coast and Tokyo look very fun; love the race car sounds
2. the voice acting - great; love all of the personalities and they were well chosen; Michael Cain, Cwen Wilson- they are great.
3. spy/James Bond spoof - Roger Moore is my generation's Bond and I LOVED Bond.

aspects I don't like
1. what's up with the guns? I guess it's just a typical American film with violence and guns
2. torture and violence - I was surprised they said ""kill"" several times and also in the beginning the car actually ""died"" before being ""tortured."" it's just a little raw for a young audience. I don't think James Bond is something you can spoof for little kids - even if they are non-humans and you don't see actual blood and death. it's just a very adult theme.",1391212800,,1015,4.388297872340425

3640052,4,B001HN6922,"It's a fun movie, my children really like it but for me, it kind of leaves out everything that was great about the first one... A lot of guns too which was surprising (I'm not anti-guns BTW) It wasn't bad, I just didn't walk out of the theater thinking ""we're buying that when it comes out on DVD"" We just rented it on Amazon but have no plans to do again soon or buy it...

But as for Amazon's instant play, I really prefer this instead of DVDs now. We recently purchased Despicable Me 2 and it's nice to be able to access it anywhere (laptop while away from home, on the Wii or a Sony player we have) It's nice to not lose DVDs or scratch them!",1389657600,,646,4.046875

If you've seen Mater's Tall Tales, this movie is more like those shows and should have been titled as such. This movie was nothing more than a cash grab and a desperate attempt for Larry the cable guy to look smart (which didn't work). Planes is a much better movie and it could have worked as a prequel to Cars if this movie hadn't killed the franchise. Rent it first.",1388448000,,501,4.175257731958763

Well, Cars DID set our expectations very high, but in Cars 2, no one learns a lesson, which was what made Cars worth watching. Lightning McQueen learned that compassion is more important than winning, but the characters are static in Cars 2. Yes, the animation is very good, and it's funny, but WHERE WERE THE SCREENPLAY WRITERS?",1387843200,,395,4.823529411764706

I watched this with my small children and was very disappointed that it included so much violence. And, what's the deal with all the drinking? Seriously? It seemed like a main theme.

It received two stars for the animation and the humor parts. I would have liked to give more but I also would have liked a better storyline, one that would leave all the death and booze to another stupid 007 movie that I'll never watch.",1387065600,,590,4.444444444444445

I was excited to watch this movie with them, when they got it for their birthday but I was immediately extremely disappointed. We aren't super sheltered with the things our children watch. But when one of the first scenes shows the ""bad cars"" having killed/crushed a spy agent, I wanted to turn it off. We watched the whole movie and afterwards I thought I was going to have to detox my boys from what they watched. The first movie doesn't have ""bad guys"" and encourages kids to look outside the box and see the good in everything and want to help others. I didn't see a ""theme"" to this movie at all, except that it was showing bad behavior and some bad decisions were ok. We won't be watching this one again.

Mater is a kind of Pink Panther, while befuddling things for McQueen's race he is accidentally helping the British crime stoppers and becomes aware of his being an idiot and decides to save McQueen from his mistakes and be a hero by being brave and joining the British spy agents in stopping the bad guys and solving the mysteries with his vast knowledge of car parts he is able to trace to the real perpetrator.",1383696000,,784,4.413793103448276

3640180,1,B001HN6922,"Cars 1 was was fun and lighthearted; it was free of an agenda.  Cars 2 was all about evil oil companies and bad guy cars who fight the use of Allinol, an alternative fuel source.  The ringleader of the bad guy cars disguises himself as a respected all-electric car when he's really an evil oil burning car, and leader of the ""lemons"", a group of old oil and gas burning cars.  It's environmental and political indoctrination of our kids disguised as a family fun movie.  It's innocent enough that those who complain may be considered conspiracy theorists, but it certainly has the ability to plant a seed in kids' minds that oil burning cars are bad and we need alternatives.
In my opinion, the writers and producers could have come up with another light and breezy fun movie without an agenda, but they used the popularity of Cars 1 to send a message to unsuspecting kids and their parents to forward the environmental/global warming agenda.  Be forewarned that there is more to this movie than just a fun movie for your children.",1381795200,,1031,4.642857142857143

I did not appreciate all of the weapons and killing of cars in a movie intended for small children.  My son kept asking ""what are they doing mommy?"".  A little hard to explain....and unnecessary.  My son eventually walked away to his room to play and my husband and I ended up watching it....only since we had paid for the rental.  Like most Pixar movies, it was full of color and ultimately had a good message about friendship, but I would not watch it again.  I do not recommend.

There is a Mater short on here, but you can easily skip it -- unless you really want to watch an excessively long ad for the ""Planes"" movie.

Disney has begun the sequel / prequel / over-marketing blitz that makes people sick of things, a la Pirates of the Caribbean, and Pixar will be dead, metaphorically speaking, soon enough.  Pixar was a phenomenal success because they focused on stories meaningful to kids that engaged the mind, minus silliness and slapstick and sophomoric humor, the very things Disney is so ""good"" at.  Now we have in the Disney-managed Pixar era Cars 2, Monsters U, and Brave.  The bar is near the ground.  Cars 2 is a simplistic rehash of the original Cars.  It does not extend the story line in any meaningful way, the story is blandly simplistic, and the whole thing seems geared to Disney's marketing machine (no pun intended).

Not to mention the scene in which one car instructs another to kill someone. It's ultimately my fault for not doing the research, I know.

As a side note, I think it's ironic that we have zero tolerance policies regarding gun play or mentions of guns in our public schools, yet the MPAA gives a film with blazing Gatling guns a ""G"" rating.",1378339200,,566,4.549019607843137

3640235,3,B001HN6922,"Someone else on here commented that this film was essentially just a James Bond movie - nothing more and nothing less - and they are 100% correct.

If you go into it expecting the same type of movie as the original Cars, you will be disappointed.  If you go into it with no expectations, you will probably enjoy it for the humor and action.

And that's the main problem.  Anyone watching this movie is most likely doing so because they liked the original movie Cars.  Cars was a terrific little movie overflowing with emotional content - from the sadness of the forgotten town, through the sadness of the forgotten race car (Doc/Hornet), to the developing emotional connections between Lightning and Mater and of course, Lightning and Sally.

Anyone going to watch Cars 2 will get _none_ of that.  Zero.  Zip.  Nada.  Aside from one brief attempt where Lightning gives a speech about friendship (which ultimately comes off very flat), there is no emotion whatsoever.  Even Lightning and Sally's relationship is downplayed when she continuously makes comments about how ""hot"" another race car looks.  Add to that the fact that Lightning McQueen isn't even the main character any more having been relegated to what is, essentially, a secondary role.  Mater takes center stage in this one and it's a straight up spy/Man who knew too little expose.  Which works just fine and is entertaining in its own right.  It's just not what we have come to expect from the fine story weaving folks at Pixar.  In the end, Cars 2 did not work very well for me.",1377734400,,1543,4.7443609022556394

3640301,3,B001HN6922,"Well my kids (6 and 3 years old) enjoyed it, which i guess is the point. My wife and I weren't as thrilled about it. It was definitely MUCH more violent than the original Cars. Other than  a few of the main characters, it bore little resemblance to the first movie. I thought the first movie was clever, original, funny, and well done. The second movie wasn't nearly as clever or funny. I have to give some credit to Pixar for creating a somewhat original movie. Most sequels nowadays just rehash the same gags as the previous movie, so at least Cars2 was different. But I thought it was too far different than the previous movie. I really enjoyed the Mater's Tall Tales movie, so I was hoping Cars 2 would be more like that.",1374624000,,725,4.37037037037037

3640316,3,B001HN6922,"This is overall an excellent movie. Quality production by Disney. However, I had to take away 2 stars for 2 main reasons:

3D special effects are very average. Nothing spectacular here. Seems like this movie was not originally shot in 3D, but was converted into 3D after production. So, save your money and buy the 2D version.

Granted this is a ""spy"" movie, the plot is too complicated for a young kid to understand.",1373932800,,417,4.621621621621622

3640320,3,B001HN6922,"This review is not a reflection of the quality of service as it is the quality of the movie. Streaming was good, HD was not all that great, but the movie was average, to say the least. Watched it with my daughter and she almost fell asleep. It seemed more geared towards an adult audience and lacked the great storyline that the first on had. The ""spy"" twist was a little bit clich, over the top for kids, and the characters lacked development. That is just my take. I could be wrong!",1373587200,,484,4.271739130434782

We would have appreciated a little warning that they are extremely different.  It's basically an animated Mission Impossible spy flick complete with torture, murder, oh and a Hollywood commentary on Big Bad Oil.  Upsides, mater steals the show, international storyline is great and the animation is fantastic.  I don't recommend it for small children, but overall not a bad movie.",1373328000,,511,4.784090909090909

They are 3 and 2, but they normally can sit through Cars entirely without moving except for food/drink/bathroom.
The three of us got bored not too far into it and never finished it. I plan to try to push through it to the end, maybe it gets better?",1372982400,,480,4.285714285714286

""Cars 2"" is much better than most animated fare that is available (""Robots"", ""hoodwinked"", ""Jimmy Newtron"", etc.).  However, relative to the standards that Pixar has set over the last ~20 years, ""Cars 2"" is a disappointing movie.  If you thought Mater was grating the first time around, get ready to have him be the center of attention.  If you thought Mater was the best part of ""Cars"", then prepare to have him go on an empty adventure with a back-handed character arc.  Of the 14 Pixar films that currently exist, this is definitely #14.  Again, that ranking only holds relative to Pixar films.",1372377600,,664,4.883928571428571

We watched Cars 2 once and vowed never to play it again.

Lighting is downright mean to Tow Mater in Cars 2. He is so consistently cruel that when I'm explaining it to my 2 yr old I have to tell him that Lightning is being mean, Lightning is being ""not nice"", Lightning is hurt Mater's feelings, Lightning...

3640411,3,B001HN6922,"I was disappointed. I am sure there are a lot of both positive and negative feelings towards this movie. For me the negative is really in the let down that this movie is following up the original Cars. Pixar had done an amazing thing with the first Cars movie. They had created a world and a story line that was almost universally age appropriate. Now I know that is debatable and that is why I say almost. No super evil villain, no real violence, romantic relationships handled tastefully, but that was the the first movie. Not all of that can be said of Cars 2. Cars 2 wasn't all bad it just wasn't Cars.",1369180800,,606,4.324561403508772

 is always good, and this is well made. It was especially enjoyable to see references to the

3640436,5,B001HN6922,"Alright this movie is just one of the best spy movies out there and it's a spy movie with cars.
I see the main problem that most parents have with this movie is the large amounts of 'deaths' that happen in the movie. I will point you attention to the fact that these are 'CARS' not people. I saw it as it came and understood that it was just the death of a car not a person. We see cars get destroyed all the time in everyday life so it wasn't something that came as a shock to me or my little six year old cousin when we saw this movie together. Also it's not all guts and gore or even blood so I could see how the movie got a G rating.
The amazing part of this movie was the growth of Mater and the resonating friendship that he and McQueen have with one another. That's the part that makes you know that it's a Pixar movie is that kind of deep emotion that makes your heart go out to the characters.
The action was what had you at the edge of your seat in anticipation and the jokes just flowed right in and like some of the more recent Disney films you had NO idea who the villain was until the end.
To sum it up Cars 2 is an amazing movie to be enjoyed by kids everywhere but some parents need to see that these are cars and that your kids have see worse off cars on the side of the road during a drive then what happens here.
Francesco will make you laugh, Mater will be Mater, McQueen will learn that a true friend doesn't care about what others say, and McMissile is the new Bond.

3640459,3,B001HN6922,"One of the increasingly annual summer treats is a usually delightful trip into an imaginary world dreamt by Disney's Pixar Animation Sudios.  Last year's entry, Toy Story 3, was one of two Disney films that grossed over $2 billion (the other being Alice in Wonderland).  This year's Cars 2, while not quite the blockbuster that was the previous year, is currently the reigning box office champion and will surely gross more than its rivals.
Cars 2 is a much darker movie than the first which is quite clear from the beginning.  The audience is quickly thrown into the world of Cars espionage with Finn McMissile, voiced by the always great Michael Caine discovering a villainous plot on an oil platform in the middle of the ocean.  While this is the catalyst for the entire film, the gravity of the situation never resonates with an audience.  The choice to use personified trains, planes, and automobiles makes the otherwise very violent events appear to be not so gruesome.
2006's Cars arguably stared the young and nave racecar Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) but this story is clearly that of the rusty, dumb witted tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy).  Their story starts back at Radiator Springs (a once dilapidated relic of Route 66 since restored to former glory by becoming the home of Piston Cup champion McQueen) as McQueen returns home to begin summer adventures with Mater.  Soon Mater lands McQueen in the World Grand Prix, the first ever race of its kind.
The race or more its purpose is the most bothersome part of the film.  A billionaire car, Sir Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard), who happens to be an SUV turned green car, creates a new type of renewable fuel that will replace gasoline.  All contestants in his race must utilize this fuel.  Of course the villains on the oil platform at the beginning of the film are set against this from happening.  However, the problem is not that the film decided to take a political issue at hand (as they clearly did in 2008's Wall-E); it is that they wavered on the topic.  It is hard to believe that children, or even most adults, will be able to follow the ecological conflict that moves the plot.
Overall the film is a fun, thoughtless adventure about friendship with a little bit of politics thrown in.  Thankfully the almost ceaseless action prevents the audience from dissecting the flaws until the lights come up.  The struggle will be reduced by most to the ""good"" and the ""bad.""  Or even the ""haves"" and the ""have nots,"" as the villains are humorously ""lemons.""
It is not so much that Cars 2 is a bad movie it is just that Pixar set the bar so high with Toy Story 3 that almost any movie would fall short.  To be honest, it was surprising that the Cars gang even got a second look and would be even more so if they got a third.  Perhaps now with the bar so low next year's entry Brave will have an easier task of impressing its audience.",1366588800,,2904,4.586073500967118

3640465,5,B001HN6922,"I'm really glad I went ahead and bought this for my two year old son. We LOVED the first cars movie, and really wanted to buy the second. I hesitated buying it because of the negative reviews saying there was too much violence for a G rated movie. I really wanted to avoid any movies with violence for such a young, vulnerable age. I waited on it for a while, and kept reading the reviews here before making the plunge and purchasing it.

Before doing so, however, I ended up going to YouTube to see if there were any short videos of the ""violent"" parts, and am very happy I did. I highly recommend anyone else questioning whether or not to buy this movie to do the same, and to make your own decision based on your personal comfort level. The short scenes are out there, so be an informed consumer and watch before you buy. You should only buy this movie if you're comfortable with the worst scenes. We, personally, were fine with the ""torturing"" scene, as bad as that sounds. Sure, they could have skipped it all together and I wouldn't miss it whatsoever, but it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I also really wish they didn't use the word ""kill"" throughout the movie, since saying let's ""GET"" him would have the same impact. But, again, these issues weren't prevalent all throughout the entire movie and didn't effect our decision to purchase and ENJOY the movie.

As for the wheel to wheel car fighting - well, that's just funny. My two year old smashes and crashes his cars together all the time - what's the difference? It's a fun movie, the races are exciting and the friendship lessons are great. There are some explosions and gun fire as well - so in the end you just have to decide what you're okay with your child being exposed to. If you do a little research before you can make an informed enough decision so you won't regret your purchase. To each their own - but we LOVE the cars movies!!!",1366070400,7,1906,4.396600566572238

I find it a little more entertaining than the original Cars, but the idea for Cars 2 to be a spy movie..well, let me put it this way; I think a spy themed film would be better off as a separate Pixar film. The idea for this movie is somewhat pointless, but its not a terrible movie (and to tell you all the truth I enjoy it more than Pixar's Up). But I think this represents that the Cars francise is more for little kids.

The animation is incredible and the acting is fine. The story is over-the-top, but that's fine. It's exciting and it keeps moving. My only caveat is that the version I got (used, through Amazon) is a bare-bones edition, with not one single bonus feature; not even a trailer. Disney has apparently released a plethora of editions of this -- including that ridiculous 11-disc one. Eleven? Come on! At least some of those various editions must have making-of documentaries, even though those are usually just puff-pieces. But I do like to see the actors in front of the mic, doing their lines. But that caveat aside, I quite enjoyed this film. Maybe I wouldn't if I were a kid, but those days are long gone. For me, as old as I am and as many movies as I've seen, this is a fun film.

3640590,4,B001HN6922,"Pixar's newest release is slick. And when I say slick, I mean it's SLICK. In the same way that Lightning McQueen is speed, Cars 2 is slick. Shiny. Mint. The animation is... there are no actual words for what the animation is. Especially the animation on the racing locations. I sat there thinking, ""I want to go there."" Especially when they were racing in Italy, and, actually, I have no real desire to go to Italy, but those scenes... I would have just stepped into them if I could have.

Cars 2 embraces everything kids loved about Cars and focuses in on it and makes it Bigger. Better. Faster and more intense (to quote a famous director (well, he's not famous for being a director, but that's the phrase he's known for when directing (points for anyone that knows whom))). Throw in Michael Caine as Finn McMissile, the James Bond of the movie, and you have  the perfect mix for the perfect spy spoof. And it is. If you can imagine a James Bond movie where he's accompanied by Johnny English (a Rowan Atkinson creation, if that gives you any idea). Actually, just see Cars 2, and you won't have to imagine it. Caine is suave and sophisticated while Larry the Cable Guy is, well, Mater.

In comparison to other Pixar movies, this one has been getting bad reviews. Which puts it on just about even footing with other movies. As a total aside, I find it extremely curious that the first movie that Pixar has released that attacks a particular group, in this case Big Oil, is the first of their movies to get any kind of negative reaction. In general, their movies have been about the human condition, and this one is, too, but Cars 2, specifically, makes the statement that Big Oil is bad. WALL-E has a similar theme, an environmental theme, but they don't target any particular group with that movie; they play it safe by equating their environmental message with said human condition -- humans need to ""shape up"" but not any specific ones. But, hey, I agree with them, Big Oil is bad. They are one of the big evils in the world, and, if Pixar wants to call them to the carpet, I'm good with that. I mean, when a Saudi prince starts talking about how they need to drive oils prices down so they can keep the US dependent on the Middle East for oil, you know something's wrong.

I'm not trying to say there's any kind of conspiracy against Cars 2 or Pixar by Big Oil, but I do find the negativity surrounding the movie to be, well, like I said, curious.

Moving past the oil thing, probably, the biggest ""flaw"" of the movie is its failure to meet audience expectations. Cars is about Lightning McQueen. He is the star of the movie. The trailers leading up to Cars 2 support our assumption and expectation that Lightning will, again, be the star of Cars 2. Pixar fails to prepare us for the reality, and the blame for that lies squarely with them. Or with Disney. With whoever prepared the trailers, but I'd find it hard to believe that Pixar didn't have some control over that. The truth is, though, is that Lightning is not the hero of the sequel. That distinction falls on Mater (If you doubt it, check to see who got top billing for the movie. Hint: it wasn't Owen Wilson). I think it's quite possible that adult audiences just couldn't come to grips with the comic relief from the first movie taking over in the spotlight in the second. Kids, though... well, kids love Mater, and I'm pretty sure it hasn't been an issue for them.

That's a failing I often see in reviews of movies for kids, the tendency to belittle them for no reason other than that they're for kids. Pixar, of course, has spoiled the wider audience by making their movies equally appealing to adults, so when they release a movie that is geared (no pun intended) more toward kids, adults get a little upset over it.

If Cars 2 does a have a failing, I'd say it's one of story telling. The big plot is the spy story with the message about big oil, but they needed something else to give it that emotional impact they're known for, so they tried to weave in a story about friendship and how we need to accept our friends for whom they are. Lightning is embarrassed of Mater. In fact, it is the early conflict over this that sends Mater off on his adventure. However, because the movie is focused on Mater, we never get the opportunity to make an emotional connection with Lightning over the issue, so there's no tug on our heart when we get to the pay off for that in the movie. Just an intellectual acknowledgment that, yes, we shouldn't try to make our friends be someone they're not. It's the failure of these two story lines to support each other that leaves the audience feeling that there could have been something more. Sort of like making one peanut butter sandwich and one jelly sandwich and leaving it to the audience to figure out what to do with them.

Having said that, I do feel the need to point out that this movie is still vastly superior to the average Hollywood offering. If this is the worst Pixar has to offer, and I'm not saying it is, because I actually enjoyed it a lot more than WALL-E, no one has any reason at all to complain. And it's worth saying: Big Oil is bad.",1357344000,2,5163,4.421661409043113

It's one of those mindless parodies of James Bond that has to come along once in a while.

This is a Spy Movie- either a homage or a parody, take your pick. But with all the parts (heh) being played by cars (and trucks, etc).

Full of humor aimed at young boys, it also has quite a few little jokes aimed at a more adult crowd, especially car buffs.

This is aimed straight at the little boy market who isn't all that interested in ""princesses"". It hits that market dead on, but it can be enjoyed by the whole family.",1349136000,,592,4.221238938053097
3640688,3,B001HN6922,"When a child-friendly movie can make kids laugh and cry while also entertaining and emotionally affecting adults, you have a winner, and this was Pixar's claim to fame. My personal list of DVDs and Blu-rays is color coded to indicate my level of enjoyment of each film.  The entire Pixar section of my list was solid blue, as in blue ribbon. But after an unexpected (by me) and phenomenal eleven straight Pixar feature-length movies ""in the blue"", Cars 2 broke the color barrier in my listing.

Technically, the Blu-ray is reference quality in both picture and sound, but the other pillar of Pixar's success, an engaging story, sputtered in this sequel to the original Cars movie. With its overly frenetic activity and frequently loud soundtrack, Cars 2 seems to be aimed squarely at the Attention Deficit Disorder generation.  This might be a winning formula for today's audience, but it is not a formula for a timeless classic.  Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., or any of the Toy Story trilogy will still be loved by kids and adults fifty years from now.  Cars 2 will not be so favored.

Despite this hopefully temporary setback in Pixar's storytelling record, Cars 2 is still as good or better than almost anything from other contemporary animation studios.  Perhaps the most significant observation would not be that Pixar has had a fumble, but rather that they carried the ball for such a long time and with such consistent advances in audio/visual and narrative technique.  It is my hope and expectation that Pixar will go onward and upward with their technical wizardry, but back to their founding emotional core for their approach to storytelling.",1348876800,,1651,4.935018050541516

3640704,2,B001HN6922,"I saw Cars several years before I became a parent and thoroughly enjoyed it. Cars is the first full length movie that my 2.5 year old son has had the patience to sit though, and even after a view dozen viewings, I still enjoy watching the movie with him. I had heard that Cars 2 was not very good and was not appropriate for young kids, and although I remained a bit skeptical, I figured that I should watch the movie myself before showing it to my son. Unfortunately, the criticism is right. First and foremost, the movie simply isn't very good. It's an interesting idea to do a spoof of a James Bond style movie, but it didn't work out very well. The plot was pretty weak and felt forced. I think the movie would be even worse if you didn't already have a connection to Lighting and Mater from the original. The bigger issue though, is that this movie is not at all appropriate for young kids. Apart from the fact that it would be difficult for a young kid to follow, I thought the level of violence was totally inappropriate. I have no problem with violent cartoons generally--I grew up on action cartoons and plan to show my son some of the greats, like GI Joe--but even in the ""violent"" action cartoons the bad guys don't actually kill the good guys. Not that my son would understand now, but it just seems unnecessary to have to explain to a young child all of the violence and death. I was excited to show my son cars 2 given how much he likes the original, but I definitely won't be showing this one to him for at least a few years. It's unfortunate that they had to ruin such a good franchise.",1346889600,6,1602,4.29042904290429
3640705,5,B001HN6922,"This movie is certainly more action packed than the original (which is a complaint of many), but my 6 year old son loves it more than the first and I'd say that it is certainly a close call as to which is better (the first one edges it out).  Lots of chases, spys, and gunfights.  It has all the classic spy movie themes (even a little romance, but nothing inappropriate).  I've seen a lot of complaints that the movie was too scary for a two year old - but who takes two year olds to movies anyways - that is just ridiculous.  I mean ignoring the questions of very young children and screen time (or even the appropriateness of the movie to that age) - why spend that kind of money on something they will never remember anyway.  The violence is certainly ratcheted up in this movie and others have compared it to The Incredibles - I think that is a fair assessment.  Commonsense Media rates the average age appropriateness at 6 and I would go as young as 5 depending on your kid.  Bottom line, boys will love it.",1346889600,,1013,4.3
3640706,3,B001HN6922,"As much as our entire family loved the first installment of Cars, we were rather disappointed with Cars 2.  In plain words, it feels like mixed salad - too many ingredients i.e. characters, the plot is not clear, and the dialogue is rather poor.  That said, I will probably not buy the third installment of ""Cars.""",1346803200,,314,4.589285714285714
3640707,3,B001HN6922,"Most critics argue that Cars 2 lacks the gravitas (someone else's word, not mine) of previous efforts. While I think that going into a cartoon expecting a deeply moving experience is silly for an adult, I'll grant that Pixar injects some sentiment into their movies, but it's often a tad cloying. As for the original Cars, what was the big teary epiphany? That you need to take a break from the rat race and smell the desert roses once in a while? That you shouldn't judge people too harshly at first? Are these serious lessons any more so than the one from Cars 2 that dealt with being yourself? I don't think so. They're both fortune cookie fodder. The reason I enjoy Pixar movies is because they're entertaining, funny, and visually appealing. The harder you try to focus on some larger commentary, the less I like the movie (I'm thinking of Up and Toy Story 3 at this point).  You're making a cartoon. Stick with the entertainment and spare me the maudlin manipulation. Although it can be argued that Cars 2 tries too hard to make a point about alternative fuels, how in the world is this bad unless you are affiliated with a major oil corporation?

As for the fact that most of the original cast is marginalized, I applaud taking the concept in a totally different direction. Most sequels fail because they try to replicate the original movie. In Cars 2, they left it all behind and went on a global espionage thrill-ride packed with new characters and plenty of wink-wink nods to foreign culture, spy movies, and the Pixar cannon. It's the most action-packed Pixar movie since The Incredibles and since the sequel to that movie -the best one in Pixar's history - is stalled, I'll take what I can get.

While Cars 2 is not going to end up on my shelf because it's too long, has too many annoying self-references (including the aforementioned Incredibles and a pathetic one for director John Lasseter), and the grating Larry the Cable Guy has far too big a role, at least I don't feel like I wasted my time with it like I did with both Toy Story 3 and Up.",1346630400,,2059,4.529569892473118
3640708,2,B001HN6922,"I got the movie because my two year old son loves to play with the toy cars from the movie.  It never even crossed my mind that a movie from which his favorite toys were created and from the makers of Toy Story and Cars 1 would create a movie that I would have to turn off after 30 minutes, but after watching for a half house, my son told us, ""I scared.

I, on the other hand loved the movie.  I could do without the political message about alternative energy, but overall, I was satisfied.

He lost interest in Cars 2 in the first 15 minutes. I have to admit it didn't hold my interest either. This is such a radical departure from the original Cars. I think the producer went too far allowing this story line to depart so much from the strong character focus of Cars. Cars 2 also seemed loud, dark, and flashy.

This may have been a good video done on it's own but as a sequel I think it fails.

3640735,4,B001HN6922,"Cars (2006) was set in the hopeful neon-infused twilight of humanity, robot creations still steeped in the better values of the creators.  Just after an unspecified human exinction event, artificially-intelligent self-driving cars emerge as the dominant beings on earth.  They lead an idyllic existence, enjoying the freedom to roam in world newly theirs.  Sport centers around more-or-less fair racing competitions, where performers and observes exhibit values and emotions that would make their ethics module engineers proud: misbehavior goes no further than shirking duty or physically aggressive racing.

With global energy supplies running down, in Cars 2 the world of these self-driving, nanotech-expressive cars turns considerably darker.  It opens with a deadly battle over hidden oil reserves involving AI destroyers, huge explosions, and the movie's first fatalities.  In this militarized, postapocalyptic world, even simple tow-trucks bristle with concealed weapons.  Murder and deception are commonplace in the struggle for energy dominance.  The role of racer McQueen evolves from overpowered maverick rookie to naive foil, as he remains one of the few unarmed believers in the old order.  He races full out in an increasingly meaningless contest as darker and more dangerous forces battle all-out over the future of their world.",1341705600,,1342,5.737373737373737

This time set in multiple locations around the world, Cars 2 moves at a faster pace than its predecessor, with more action, comedy and a more intricate plot.  Whereas the first film followed the traditional Pixar line of a movie about a character's emotional growth, this film is more like standard Hollywood fare of a big budget action-comedy, except tailored for all ages.  As to this package, the Blu-Ray and DVD both come with the famous Pixar short, along with a small extra featuring Mater.

3640739,1,B001HN6922,"This is my son's review.

After reading the other reviews, I see that they are more preoccupied with the heavy violence and political preaching in this film. Although these might be concerns to some, I would like to focus on the myriad of plot, character, and plain old problems this film is riddled with. (By the way, I didn't really care about the picture's support for alternative fuels.  The debate in ""Cars 2"" was more about corruption and international intrigue than any sort of political message.). There are two camps in which my quibbles can be divided into:

 #1: The Plot. The story of ""Cars 2"" was paper thin. There was scarcely any character development. The films seems to be a thinly-veiled send-up of action and James Bond movies, a la ""The Naked Gun"", but there is too much serious pyrotechnic stunts and projectile-based action to actually qualify as a spoof. The jokes were unfunny, mostly of the immature toilet humor kind. All the action-adventure sequences can't make up for the lack of substantial plot. Too many movies demonstrate this. Why should Pixar?

#2: The Characters. As I said before. no development. Most of the major characters from the previous film are either missing or relegated to minor rolls. The decision to kill off likable Doc Hudson (off-camera, of course) means the film is lacking both a father figure and a sort of commentator towards the action. Fillmore was in a woefully small role, and the film lacked a peacenik voice of reason and compassion. Sarge's comic hard-line militarism is also one, seeing his extremely tiny roll. I don't remember Red, Lizzy, Ramone, Flo, Luigi, or Guido being doing more than making a cameo. In fact, I don't remember some of them being in ""Cars 2"" at all! Finn McMissile was one of the few likable characters, but his accent and lack of British dry wit meant that he quickly outlived his usefulness. His female companion was dull, and Lightning McQueen has now been downgraded to a whiner who sits on the sidelines and does nothing while Mater does heroic acts. Mater himself was very annoying, not at all funny or likable. I always thought that Larry the Cable Guy wasn't humorous anyways.

In conclusion, this is the worst Pixar movie by far, behind ""Ratatouille"", which could have been done better in live action with anamatronic and puppet rats. I hope that Pixar doesn't keep producing trash like ""Cars 2"".",1337472000,4,2393,4.824390243902439

3640742,5,B001HN6922,"I saw so many things that I recognized. It probably means more to me because I love car shows. I identified the European makes and the American models. There were many corollaries between the performance of those cars and the characters they represented. I felt like I was revisiting cities in Europe where the races took place. They were brilliantly drawn and the depth of field was excellent. The many references to the Bond movies helped. For me there was a lot of humor in the portrayal of the human emotions of the cars.

I liked the storyline and the animation a lot more in Cars 2 over Cars 1. This was a rare case where the sequel was better than the original. I read a lot of the negative reviews but I was thoroughly entertained and not offended by the dialogue that touched a lot of people's nerves.",1336176000,4,810,4.436241610738255

3640758,3,B001HN6922,"The Cars series is definitely the weakest of the excellent movies put out by Pixar. I think it has more to do with what they have to work with. There's only so much you can do with a car.

Although, visually as usual it is fantastic and the details are tremendous. If you read Japanese, you'll get a kick out of the names of the shops during the opening race held in Japan. Plus kudos on getting the colloquial spoken Japanese right.

I just found the whole spy plot a bit silly and way too much focus on Cars 2 on Mater. He's goofy for sure but I wouldn't consider him the character you'd want the focus on.

The extras are nice. You get a Toy Story short where the toys create a Hawaiian vacation for Ken & Barbie. There's also an Air Mater short as well as in the previews is one for a Pixar movie called Planes coming out in spring 2013. The tie-in is obvious as it looks basically like Cars in the air.

3640762,4,B001HN6922,"There is no disputing the fact that this is the worst of Pixar's films... but by any other standard, it's not a terrible movie.

I bought this mostly to complete my collection, and was surprised that I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. It has a lot of flaws, but when watching it, I never thought ""I don't want to be watching this."" It was simple easy watching.

Expect it to compare to the likes of Up and Toy Story, and it will be the worst movie you've ever seen. Take it in stride, and you might find it to be light escapism. I was going to give it three stars, but then I remembered it contains the wonderful Toy Story short: Hawaiian Vacation. That is easily enough to bump it up to four.",1333411200,,865,4.173652694610778

But poor Mater has gotten mixed up with the spies and finds himself in international trouble. He finds himself in a position to stop the bandits who are trying to sabotage the races and kill Lightning McQueen. It's a heartwarming story about friendship and it is funny for both children and adults alike. It was a big hit with my 9 yr old and almost 3 year old, and even my husband enjoyed it.

It lived up to all the hype thouroughly.  This installment of Cars centers more around Mater than Lightning McQueen, which to me is a lot better.  Mater stumbles into the middle of an international spy investigation while trying to help Lightning win a multicontinent racing series.  Of course, Mater gets into all sorts of trouble, makes a lot of mistakes, creates a lot of comedy, but ultimately saves the day.  The movie has a lot of eliments of James Bond in it, and the detail put into it is a exceptional as always.

Was this as good as the first one?  No, but that's pretty hard to do.  Was there a pretty blatent message against large oil corporations throughout the movie?  Yes, but it doesn't ruin the movie.

It is a different flavor than the original but it is still quite enjoyable.

I specifically purchased this combo pack for the digital copy - so our kids would be able to watch it on a certain 7"" android tablet that we also got for Christmas.  HAH!  Boy was I wrong in thinking that would work!

I was stupid enough to believe the representations in the studio's advertisements where they show people watching the movie on non-connected (and non-itunes) devices.

In anticipation of a long car trip, I downloaded the ""digital copy"" and transferred it to our 7"" android tablet (hoping to surprise the kids).  Imagine how pleased I was to find that the tablet would not play the file and that
I can only watch the file on the laptop that I downloaded the file onto.
!?HUH?!
What good does that do?
If I wanted to play the movie on my laptop then I'd just put the disk in the drive.
In what way is that the same as the claims represented in the studio's ""digital copy"" advertisements?

Oh, and the cherry on top of the whole thing is that the ""copy"" EXPIRES next year (?!?!?!?!).

Long story short, if you like the movie like we do then buy the appropriate disk but don't pay any extra for the digital ""copy"".

The one qualifier I'd offer to the above is that perhaps if you already have an apple ecosystem at your house then this ""might"" let you use the file UNTIL IT EXPIRES...",1329523200,,1469,4.3127272727272725

Cars 2 might of tried to teach something but, it was overshadowed by guns, hate, drug use and the intent to kill. There were fights, many cars were shot and several were destroyed using a laser. The scene that disgusted me the most was when a character was visually tortured on screen and at the end of the torturing he was put to death. Now I am a man that owns guns, hunts for food and have taught my children to respect the dangers of guns. I would not suggest this movie to anyone it has no values. I am not sure how this was rated G, had the same scenes done with people it would of been rated R. All of our children are smart enough to make the correlation between these characters and people.

3640853,3,B001HN6922,"Pixar changed the face of animation back in 1995 with ""Toy Story"" and the studio continues to do terrific films.  This isn't one of them.  Pixar's stock in trade has been to not only produce the best visual animation, but to have heartfelt storylines and enough inside humor to keep the adults interested.  In this sequel to the significantly better original, they get the visuals right.  In fact, I don't know if I've ever had a better picture on my plasma.  And the DTS-HD sound is perfect as well.  From a technical aspect this is reference quality stuff.

Lightning (Owen Wilson) gets invited to a World Grand Prix which will take place in Japan, England and France.  It is sponsored by a company that has developed a new fuel that is expected to replace oil based gasoline.  Lightning reluctantly invites his best friend Mater the tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy) along.  A spy plot surfaces as nefarious losers cars (Pacers, Gremlins, Yugos) are bent on destroying the race cars with some type of laser beam.  They don't want fossil fuel to be supplanted.  British master counter spy Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and his cohort Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) mistake Mater as an American contact.

Larry the Cable Guy has the most to do in this adventure and frankly a little goes a long way.  After a while, I could certainly understand Lightning's reluctance to bring him along.  Still as his best friend, Lightning shouldn't be upset when Mater screws up and embarrasses everyone.  In the end of course Mater saves the day.  Unlike most of the other Pixar films, I had no tears welling up in my eyes and don't remember laughing or snickering much either.  I saw this in 2-D and I suspect the 3-D is spectacular if unnecessary.  Most kids and some parents will likely have fun with the movie.",1328054400,,1804,4.706070287539936

They simply will not understand much of the material that is showed in the beginning, but for Bond, James Bond fans, this show excels The Incredibles, which had a very Bond-ish feel to it (music, creeping around, etc.). This film was blatant Bond in classic form, complete with a shallow reason for hating the world and a hidden villain that is revealed only at the last moment by . . . of all cars, Mater!

The is one moment that had my wife and in stitches (and the player in pause) but for the most part, the humor is not over the top. Sure, the show is fun, but unless you're really alert, you can easily become lost through the first half of the show. And that's too bad, considering the amount of work that must have gone into making this incredible film.

So what didn't I like enough to give this five stars? The somewhat confusing plotline for one thing. That and this certainly was not geared for young children, which is where most of the Pixar films shine (with a couple of exceptions -- Up being one of them).",1327968000,,1068,4.335

3640858,1,B001HN6922,"My 6-year old son liked the first Cars movie, loves Tow-mater, and couldn't really pay attention to this and fell asleep. Not because he was tired, because it didn't make much sense to him, and I don't blame him.

I got kind of angry, because its a shame to spend money on such a lousy movie, and have the precious time with a young wasted on this. I'm also shocked that Pixar would put together such a lousy movie.

My main criticisms are:

- My 6-year old, Pixar loving son completely did not enjoy it - so what's the point?

- Too many plot points and lines that reference James Bond, etc. that will go over a kid's head. See, the Incredibles, for how to write lines for both kids and adults so both enjoy it. See Cars 2 for too many essential lines being over a young kid's head. Aarff.

- The sweetness and simplicity of the Cars story get replaced by ... a jumbled mess of a plot.

- Parts of it feel like a mini-ad for Ethanol. Well, there may be merit to that (or there may not), but I don't really see the point of putting that in a movie for 6-year olds. There is plenty of time for the crappy reality of big business, subsidies, rent-seeking, politics, etc. later in life. Why the heck inject that into happy family time with a 6-year old?

- And so on.

This one will age badly. I really don't understand those who rated this highly. I enjoy James Bond, I enjoyed Cars. This supposed blend of the two was not enjoyed by myself, by the kid, or other adults.

Take your kid outside and play ball with them instead, or find a card game to play, if you are tempted to buy this. You both will be happier for the choice.",1327795200,3,1626,4.169329073482428

3640880,4,B001HN6922,"I know some hate this movie because it makes big oil look bad. I think that is a little unenlightened opinion. Cars 2 is not a propaganda movie against oil, it is a action adventure flick for kids where a company who produce oil though unethical means is one of the villains. It seams that some people think that if a big company is presented as anything but happy, happy flowers and butterflies in a movie then the flick is leftist propaganda. But here is the clue, both kids and adults can think for themselves and seeing a evil company in a movie do not mean that one think all companies is evil. It is just a movie people, it a little animated flick about talking cars so relax.

Now that I have said that what is Cars 2 about? Well this time Lightning McQueen and the gang is traveling around the world. A new environmentally friendly bio fuel have been discovered and a race is hosted to promote it, the problem however arises when there is accident after accident at the races and our heroes have to figure out what is going on in a plot which is surprisingly convoluted for a kids movie. One of the things I like about Cars 2, there is enough goofy episodes and silliness to keep young kids entertained, but the plot, which is a pretty good James Bond spoof, is actually interesting for adults. Me and my hubby who are both 30 both actually got interested the storytelling in Cars 2 and when the movie ended we felt that we had been told a pretty good one, and that is impressive for a kids movie about talking cars.

Another good think about Cars 2 is the details of the setting, every vehicle in the movie's world is alive, and the movie makers have really sat down and thought out how they could use that concept to the fullest. Note for example a scene where the characters are going through a plaza and off course there are doves, but the birds are model airplanes. That is both cute and it is a good example to the details in this movie. Cars 2 have good animation, the voice acting is good and the music fit the scenes it is used in. I also like the fact that the comic relief characters is not annoying. Many movies have a character who is just there for slapstick humor, they are usually clumsy, stupid and loud. In this movie that is Mater, a hillbilly truck, and unlike most characters of this type in other movies he is actually funny, they never do him so over the top that the viewer just want the pain to stop, and also while Master is a comic relief character he is also important to the plot and have allot of good qualities. In fact come to think about it all the characters in Cars 2 work, they are well made and make the audience want to know what happens to them.

The only thing I could complain about in Cars 2 are some phasing problem, at times the movie becomes a little slow, then everything happens at once, and then we are back to slow, rinse and repeat. However this is a minor complaint. I had allot of fun with Cars 2, the story is very good, the characters is fantastic and the universe in the movie is interesting. Also I like that they have made the second movie so different from the first, this is not just a repeat of the first Cars movie but rather a completely new story. I recommend Cars 2 to everyone and especially to people who are big James Bond and spy flick fans as this movie is a really good spoof of that genre. Cars 2 is not perfect, but it is extremely good.",1327104000,3,3417,4.253846153846154

3640912,3,B001HN6922,"On the surface, it didn't seem like there was much cause for a direct sequel to this franchise, but given their track record I had to give Pixar the benefit of the doubt. In reality, it didn't take long for those early worries to be confirmed. This is like a jumbo-sized TV episode with incredible production values but a weak, redundant script. Where the original was, clearly, the worst of Pixar's properties, at least it had an honest message at heart; that the abundance of interstates and high speed traffic has ruined the necessity and charm of small-town America, at once mourning and celebrating that lost taste of cultural charm. By comparison, there's really no reason for Cars 2 to exist. It's a straight-up Saturday morning cartoon, shifting from caper to caper without the benefit of a discernible moral. And while there's really nothing wrong with that - there's an insatiable need for kid's fodder on the big screen, certainly - it's depressing to see it coming from the same company responsible for generation-transcending classics like Monsters Inc., Toy Story and Up. While it'll undoubtably sell plenty of toys, this was the wrong movie at the wrong time for Pixar, and a rare instance of the studio losing ground to the competition.",1326672000,,1252,4.910377358490566

The regular blu-ray disc wouldn't play at all in the first one I purchased, the second one at least the regular blu ray disc plays.  The 3D stops, skips, then repeats throughout the whole movie.  I returned the original one to the Disney store and they were kind enough to replace it, but the new one they gave me (different store from original purchase) did the same thing with the 3D disc.  So, there is at least one bas batch of 3D discs that were produced.

Every movie has some darkness in it. I mean if everything in the movie was happy, the movie would not be interesting.

Aside from the story that was just a bit weak its still a great movie for all ages to enjoy. The 5 disc combo pack is a great deal. Not only you get a 3D movie, you get the Full HD, a DVD and a Digital copy. Its a win-win for anyone. I have watched the 3D version, let my brother borrow the Full HD Blu-ray disc, Let my sister borrow the DVD and put the digital copy on my iPhone. It really makes it easy for you to enjoy this movie in so many ways.... at home, on the go with your phone or ipod and even in a portable dvd player in the car.

All the James Bond-like references to the ""spy plot"" are well over the heads of most 1st/2nd graders, but what can I say.  It is true however that my children enjoy this film with all the racing (and the two bonus shorts) immensely.  And the studios will undoubtedly make a ton or two of money with all the merchandising...all these new, pretty, shiny, colorful, race cars, not to mention all the ""lemons"".  I have already gotten a new Santa list with prof Z in it... I for one found the ""story"" uninteresting, as it is sooo predictable.

My 5 year-old son and 7 year-old daughter loved it, and would watch it every day if I let them.

The blu-ray transfer is among the best I've seen. It's brilliant and clear, and the 5.1 soundtrack is well mastered.

However, I was mortified when I saw a car being tortured and then killed!  At this point I was so thankful that my children weren't even interested enough in the film to watch more than 5 minutes and by this point in the film they had lost interest entirely.  While the plot is OK - it is not geared towards the same audience that the previous film had been, and it is quite complicated for young children to follow.  I do not want to explain why cars are being tortured for information to my 4 year, let alone my 8 year old.  I am shocked that this film doesn't carry a PG13.

It is unfortunate the beloved characters from the previous movie are almost all left behind.  Further the movie isn't just dark in the sense of the plot, but it is just dark.  The previews on YouTube have the best parts of the movie - stick to those and you won't waste your money or be terribly disappointed.

I can see why some people gave a less than fair rating for what they deemed inappropriate content for a G rated movie, but as stated in another review, the movie portrayed more of a James Bond like theme.  There are parts where a car is ""tortured"" and then ""killed"" but I think it was done in a tasteful way - my kids didn't seem to think anything of it and I think that it is a thing that only the adults will really understand.  The movie still has a few good morals to be learned about friendship and being who you are and not what people want you to be.  Mater of course has his usual humor and funny quirps but also learns some things about himself, as the movie is centered more around Mater than Lightning McQueen.  Overall I give it 4 stars for the good morals in the story as well as a good plot and story line.

3641030,4,B001HN6922,"There was no doubt that a sequel to Pixars ""Cars"" film would be made.  It was all about when will it be made.

In 2006, the seventh Disney/Pixar film ""Cars"" was released in theaters.  Needless to say, the film was a major hit as it was nominated for two Academy Awards, made over $461 million worldwide.  The film was so popular that merchandise for the film is still sold in stores today and the cars have been popular toys that have earned over $5 billion in sales.

Needless to say, ""Cars"" was not just a box office success, it is one of Disney/Pixars biggest money making titles that is loved by critics and fans.

""Cars 2' becomes the 12th Disney/Pixar film and once again, ""Cars 2' would meet box office success earning over $551 million worldwide.

VIDEO:

""Cars 2' is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:39:1 aspect ratio).  As expected from a Disney/Pixar release, the picture quality is full of detail, colors are vibrant, blacks levels are deep and the textures and edges are fantastic.  Everything about this film looks perfect.  I didn't see any banding, nor did I see any artifacts or edge enhancement.

Every detail from the rust and dents on Mater, the shine on McQueen, sparks, explosions, the asphalt, the backgrounds and yes, even the water looks amazing in this film.  Overall, as one has expected from Disney/Pixar, they continue to deliver excellence for picture quality in this latest Blu-ray release!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Cars 2' is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio ES, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital and English Near Field Mix 2.0.

Similar to the picture quality, Disney/Pixar is known for its lossless audio and everything from the tires squealing to the engines roaring, explosions, machine guns and the panning from one audio extreme to another, this is an immersive soundtrack.  LFE showcases the booms of the explosions, surround channels showcase the gunfire, engines revving and because this film incorporates racing and action, the soundtrack delivers!  Especially in ambiance as McQueen and Mater are in different countries, the lossless audio is amazing!

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Cars 2' comes with the following special features:

  Director John Lasseter Commentary - Co-directors John Lasseter and Brad Lewis talk about the film but also how promotion for the first ""Cars"" film internationally  made him think about Mater (Lasseter always wears Hawaiian shirts but when invited to an F-1 party event, he realized how under-dressed and out of place he was in Italy) and Lasseter and his children's love for the ""Bourne Identity"" films led to the storyline of ""Cars 2'.
  Toy Story Toon ""Hawaiian Vacation"" - (5:53) When Barbie and Ken are expecting to go with Bonnie and her family to Hawaii, they end up being left behind.  With Ken wanting a romantic trip with Barbie and Barbie hoping to get that first kiss, Woody, Buzz and the gang decide to bring Hawaii to Bonnie's bedroom.
  Cars Toon ""Air Mater"" - (5:22) A story about Mater telling one of his stories and this time, him flying in the sky.

EXTRAS:

""Cars 2: 2-Disc Combo Pack"" comes with a slipcover case and a DVD presented in 2:39:1 aspect ratio - Enhanced for 169 televisions, English 5.1 Dolby Digital EX, English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, English Near Field Mix 2.0 Dolby Digital, English SDH subtitles, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital EX & Spanish subtitles and French 7.1 DTS-HD HR, French 5.1 Dolby Digital EX with French subtitles.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Cars 2' may have not been the critic-friendly Disney/Pixar animated film that many have hoped for but for me, it was great to see Lassetter and friends do something different.

Part of the complaints by critics was how the film was devoid of it's emotional storyline and how it focused more on Mater instead of Lightning McQueen.  And depending on one's feeling towards Mater, if you dislike the character, then chances are, the film may turn you off.  Afterall, Lightning McQueen is the cool, dashing hero of the first film and Mater is a redneck-talking, rusted tow truck.

But for me, I enjoyed the film because it was able to take the characters out of Radiator Springs and showcase them in Japan, France and Italy.  And as for Mater, yes...the storyline focuses on his character but if you enjoy spy films, to see him being mixed in an international spy case with the James Bond-ish Aston Martin-like Finn McMissile and the high tech Holley Shiftwell.  Sure, Mater is not the smartest car on the planet but to see these action sequences happening quite often, I found that to be quite refreshing for a Disney/Pixar film.

But at the same time, I must acknowledge the problem that children might not understand the discussion about alternative fuels and why the bad evil cars were trying to sabotage other race cars throughout the World Grand Prix.  I watched the film with my eight-year-old and he enjoyed the film for its action but the storyline of why the evil people were doing what they were doing, that went over his head completely.

But we were both in agreement of how cool the film was because of its action.  And this of course, may be a problem for those expecting a deep and emotional storyline.  Sure, every Disney/Pixar film typically touches you in someway and while Mater is not the typical character for some viewers not to feel sorry for, I think too much ""Mater"" for some, is not a good thing.

For me, I felt that his character was utilized in a way that was not too annoying and the fact that he is brought into this spy thriller was entertaining.

Like all Disney/Pixar films, the voice acting was excellent. But this film definitely was Larry the Cable Guy's moment to shine as the voice of Mater as he is brought together with wonderful actor Michael Caine (who plays the Bond-like spy Finn McMissile) and actress Emily Mortimer (voice of Holley Shiftwell).  But everyone on the film, Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen, Eddie Izzard as Sir Miles Axlerod, John Turturro as Francesco Bernoulli, etc.  They all do a wonderful job!

As for the Blu-ray release, as expected from a Disney/Pixar film, the picture quality and lossless audio is magnificent and perfect in every way!  Disney/Pixar films have always been magnificent on Blu-ray when it comes to PQ/AQ that it was no surprise to me that everything looked and sounded great!

But...with this being an awesome Blu-ray release, recently I began to question Disney's latest strategy of not including many special features for its normal Blu-ray release and adding them only on their Blu-ray 3D releases.  One thing that I love about Disney Blu-rays and also Disney/Pixar Blu-rays is the amount of special features included.

The first ""Cars"" Blu-ray (and DVD) release was filled with special features but not this title.  No Second Screen that Disney has been pushing, no deleted scenes, no interviews with the voice cast of ""Cars 2' but we do get the audio commentary and two animated shorts.  And as grateful as I am for the inclusion of these three special features, I have to admit that it's quite small for a major release such as ""Cars 2'.  But if you buy the much more expensive 3D version of ""Cars 2', then you get most of those special features.

It was one thing in the past, to include special features on Blu-ray and less for a DVD, in the hopes that people would upgrade to Blu-ray.  And that was a no-brainer as Blu-ray players are quite cheap these days.  But for people to upgrade to a 3D TV and purchase 3D glasses that is asking too much for the average consumer and unlike blu-ray players which are affordable, 3D TV's are still a bit pricey for many people.

But with the ""Cars 2: 2-Disc Combo Pack"", you do get that extra DVD, so with the holiday season coming up, you can definitely have the DVD playing for your children during those long traveling commutes or to keep them occupied during the holiday season.

Overall, ""Cars 2' is an enjoyable family film and an awesome Blu-ray sporting awesome animation and picture quality as well as audio quality via HD.  While many people have their opinions of this film, I absolutely enjoyed this film because it was different than the first and that I love spy action films!

""Cars 2' is a fun family film with plenty of action and humor!  Sure, it doesn't feature Lightning McQueen as the main character but I found the whole Mater spy action storyline to be quite entertaining and fun!  Also, he film looked absolutely incredible on Blu-ray!  The lossless audio was immersive and awesome!  I absolutely enjoyed this film!

In terms of video quality, the HD is very good. The fact that this is all CGI lends itself better to streaming.

My main complaint, and this isn't limited to this movie, is that streaming HD is NOT 5.1 with six channels of audio. This was full PCM that I let my analog Dolby Surround unit distribute. For a movie like this, that's more annoying if only because the web page states that the movie has 5.1 (no such claim is made, wisely, on the connected device when you go to rent).

For those that haven't see it yet, it is a darker story then the original and for my 4 year old twins a bit too complicated storyline to follow.

3641098,2,B001HN6922,"We have come to expect perfection from Pixar.  Most of their movies, especially those released in the last few years, have had such amazing character development on multiple layers that I have been left in awe at Pixar's ability to craft a story.  Of course, the animation has gotten better as technology has improved, so that each movie is a work of art.

Cars 2 is certainly a visual work of art.  Pixar has almost never failed to deliver on that point (with the exception being A Bug's Life, but that's another review for another day).  As I watched bits and pieces of Cars 2 with my son this morning, I was amazed at how impeccably the lighting reflects off the cars' front bumpers.  It's like being in a new car showroom!

HOWEVER, the story in this movie is so incredibly flat that it is almost painful to endure.  In the original Cars, I couldn't get enough of Radiator Springs.  It's a place that reminds us that there is still some good in this world.  Cars 2 issues a stark reminder that there is still much evil in the world.  I found myself wanting to find Radiator Springs and live there.  In Cars 2, I want to hide from the world.  There is no sense of nostalgia and heart and soul like there is in the original Cars.

I have also been impressed with Pixar's ability to keep politics out of their movies (with the exception of WALL-E, but again, another review...).  Most of their movies have been based on solid family values, no matter which religious or political spectrum a person finds him/herself.  Cars 2 fails on that point too.  The demonizing of oil companies and uplifting of alternative fuels certainly enters a political forum.  This kind of political viewpoint does not belong in a children's movie.  Let's leave that kind of teaching to the parents, please.",1323129600,33,1786,4.559748427672956

3641115,4,B001HN6922,"I received the DVD disc in late November.  We did not watch it immediately but the item had been well packed and the container was intact.  I placed the DVD into the player and everything played clear and crisp ... until the title was to play.  I received a read disc error message on the TV screen.  I then tried it again, but had the same result.  Going to the Disney website, I found suggestions under ""FAQ"" if you have trouble playing.  It recommended turning off the DVD player and then unplugging it for 5 - 10 minutes before plugging it back in and turning on the power.  It did not resolve the problem.  I called the Disney 1-800 telephone number for customer service.  I explained the issue and that I had obtained the disc from Amazon.  I was courteously treated and then connected to a patient technician.  I told him what I had done.  He told me that sometimes there is a build up of whatever is in the environment that can effect the playing surface.  He carefully instructed me as how to clean the disc.  I did that but, again, everything played except the movie itself.  I was promptly sent a postage free mailing label and a form to fill out device information, etc.  I have completed the form and sent the disc and container to Walt Disney Home Entertainment.  They felt that if any portion of the disc played so should the rest.  I am told that they will test the disc at their facility and determine the problem and replace if necessary.  I should note that I have heard from someone else who purchased the disc in a store and had the same problem.  Now to wait and see what happens.  UPDATE 23 DEC 11 - Just received a brand new 1 disc DVD from Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Consumer Relations Department, P.O. Box 3100, Neenah, WI 54957 to replace the one that I had obtained from Amazon.  I had filled out a lengthy form when I had sent them the first disc explaining the problems, all the info about the approximately 4 year old ""expensive"" DVD player / recorder, etc.  The return envelope had no letter / memo of explanation.  I put the new disc in the player which has been playing other DVDs without a problem.  This new Cars 2 disc played everything but the movie just like the first disc.  BUYER BEWARE!

Well apparently he didn't but that fact doesn't even take center stage in this film.  Instead we get a James Bond spoof with Mater taking center stage with two spy cars and all of the charming characters from Radiator Springs get put in almost as an afterthought.

Of course the visuals are stunning but it wasn't enough to keep my boys interested and my oldest even asked to watch something else about three times starting only 10 minutes into the movie.  One of my younger ones disappeared and returned with the original movie asking to watch it instead.

3641136,3,B001HN6922,"There exists an ingrained understanding of violence in every human being from conception, and this understanding is furthered along by the media in many instances - none better than through children's multimedia. Kids are faced with having to reconcile the idea that it is okay for the 'bad guy' to try to kill the 'good guy' - that's just what bad guys do.

A parent needs to realize that good/bad at such an early age in children's development needs to be clearly outlined but seriously folks, let's not go overboard. Violence has been around long before the first television was brought into a living room. The stories from the brothers Grimm were extremely popular yet they were considered and cruel. As it has been noted already, this Pixar movie definitely deviates from the norm as it parodies the spy genre, in particular the James Bond series. In doing so, certain aspects of the Bond movies such as torture and mayhem are bound to appear in the spoof. If this idea is unacceptable, then please skip this film.

My real criticism with this movie isn't so much regarding the violent action sequences but the storyline. Lightning McQueen's best friend Tow Mater is featured more prominently than the first film. Personally, Mater's character reminds me of that lost uncle you see once a year at Thanksgiving - the one with strictly r-rated vocabulary, poor hygiene and an unidentifiable odor to match. They can both be entertaining in perfectly smaller doses.

The visuals are everything we have come to expect from Pixar and Michael Caine shines as an undercover agent. Everyone deserves respect but the message of being true to who you really are, even if you are a moron, gets lost in the end. For a studio that delivered a great sequel (Toy Story 2) when I thought the original couldn't be topped, I want to give Pixar credit by thinking they succumbed to the pressure of producing Cars 2 on a strict timeline. It's highly enjoyable as a parody film but not an original movie I could watch more than once like the first installment.

Bottom line: I would warn against having kids younger than 5 view it; good movie in the grand scheme of children's movies; not Pixar re-defining good however.",1322611200,,2203,4.774278215223097

3641138,4,B001HN6922,"I like the duality of the message the movie tried to convey, not the environmental one, but the one where McQueen realizes he shouldn't try to change his friend but also where Mater realizes that his antics are hurtful. Who hasn't known someone who they wish would act differently while in public? As far as the violence it is really not any more prominent than in any other Pixar film, in Nemo the mother and his hundreds of siblings are all murdered in the first ten minutes. No this movie is not UP but it does tell a fun story and it tells it well. Who hasn't imagined cars as people? This movie is Pixar's interpretation of what this world would look like and I personally enjoyed it. To me Pixar is about making a story the creators want to watch and hoping others also want to watch, unfortunately this was not to everyone's taste but I applaud Pixar for continuing the franchise and cannot wait to see Planes when it is released.",1322524800,,937,4.421965317919075

OK, there is a lot of explosions and such, but still; it is cars blowing up, not humanlike characters smashing each other with frying pans.
Great family fun, minimal violence, no cursing (unless you count ""day-gum""),
Hilarious, action packed, great computer graphics.

And as so eloquently described in other reviews, this is a ""James Bond"" adventure. With all of the action, but swap humor for gratis flesh and cursing.
There IS a message interwoven here, the 007 turns out to be Mater. Could it be something like ""dont judge a book by its cover""? or maybe ""be the best you that you can be"" ?

Rent it, if you don't like it, forget it. just that simple.
If you really like it, as so many do, purchase the DVD.

As a parent of a 2 & 4 year old, I was really excited for the sequel but this was over the top with guns and violence.  As a adult I grew tired of the reused spy movie scenes.  The original left off with so much potential for a follow-up in the USA.  Say like the gang visiting family in NY, Sally and Lightning having a baby car who turns out to be a go-carting protege,... ok you get it.  Lastly, I don't see the same discovery my family has had with the original's attention to detail.  Seems like everytime we watch Cars we pick up a new detail in the background which is ingeniously place.  Still love the mountains made to look like old 30's sedands!

Basic ratings:

Pros:
* Animation
* New characters, John Turturro was great addition
* Held my 4 year old son's attention (albeit, lots of questions about the guns which was a really disappointing)

Cons:
* Tired Spy plot
* Wasted the usage of Michael Caine
* Violence
* Guns, Guns and more Guns
* Too much Mater",1322352000,2,1090,4.242718446601942
3641156,5,B001HN6922,"Reviews seem polarized - one either hates it or loves it.  My family and I all loved it.  Spies and intrigue, wild car races, and Michael Cain.  What's not to like?  I will admit that this film was more ""bloody"" (oiley?) than other animations, and that the violence was more realistic than Bugs Bunny violence.  (What isn't?)  But, like my son says in a deadpan voice, ""Seriously?""  It's a bit hard to take animated violence seriously.  Finally, the film itself has an important message (seems to be a trademark for kid's films) concerning true friendship and acceptance of others as they are.

Love it or hate it, you make the call.  My family and I loved it.",1322352000,3,660,4.564102564102564
3641157,4,B001HN6922,"For those unfamiliar with the Cars concept, the entire story takes place in an alternate world, devoid of humans but populated with anthropomorphic cars.  Such a concept should in itself indicate that an animated cartoon embracing it is most likely aimed at children, most notably boys, as opposed potential philosophers seeking the true meaning of their existence.  Which is why it is a bit puzzling that such a movie would be panned by critics for lacking sufficient emotional depth, particularly when it presents an interesting storyline, clever cultural and geographic allusions, imaginative effects, and action sequences that fit in well with the story.

In its prequel, Cars, star rookie racer Lightning McQueen, on his way to a career-defining race, finds himself exasperatingly stuck in an insular small town, Radiator Springs, where he comes to learn true friendship, loyalty, love, and character.  A solid theme, no doubt, but where does one go from there?  A return to Radiator Springs would have been dull and repetitive.  Instead, Cars 2 takes a completely different tone, where McQueen takes part in a series of races in locations such as Tokyo, London, and Italy, while he and his provincial but sincere Radiator-Springs-acquired best friend Mater become embroiled in an international spy caper.

The message is nothing extraordinary, but solid: good triumphs over evil, be true to your friends, and sometimes even the seemingly-stupid can be ingenious.  But at least one of those is a common theme in countless films, including the whole series of James Bond movies, which are alluded to throughout Cars 2.  One could even argue that Cars 2 is a better ""Bond"" movie than most of the recently released actual Bond movies.

Is the idea of a world populated by talking cars flawed?  Of course it is.  The persnickety critic could always ask the obvious, such as, who built the cars, who pumps the gas, if two cars fall in love, do they mate and produce little cars.  But to dwell on such issues would be similar to asking how alien life forms from light years away can speak perfect English, after watching a Star Trek episode, and would detract from the overall theme of the story and the cleverness of the concept, particularly when it employs some ingenious parallels between the car world and our actual human world.

Nevertheless, watching Cars 2 is an enjoyable experience for both adults and children.  Adults will marvel at cleverness of the parallels, children will love the talking cars racing around the track, and all will enjoy the interesting storyline and the characters.",1322352000,,2599,5.039719626168225

3641161,2,B001HN6922,"Today my son and I watched the Blu-ray version of Cars 2 from the 5 disk set. We had not seen the movie in the theaters so my review is mainly of the movie but I also talk about the Blu-ray quality. Overall I was a bit disappointed but let me give you the full 411.

The animation is top notch. The colors on the Blue-Ray version were awesome. The graphics were super cool and very impressive. All of this did not make up for a weak story line however. The movie starts off with an unfamiliar cast of cars so it took me a couple of minutes to figure out what was happening. It turns out that we are watching a movie about alternative fuel. Only later does the new cast meet the cast of the first Cars movie. While I enjoyed the original line up and voices, it really seemed like Cars 2 should have been totally separate but needed to ride on the success of the first movie. The story tie in was weak and the Cars 2 movie could have been developed independently. I feel like this is a sequel in name only.

I don't know who saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-E-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B0013FSL3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall-E (Single-Disc Edition)</a>&nbsp;or how you felt about it but I did not appreciate being lectured to by that movie about the ills of society, and I don't appreciate the social commentary here either. The message wasn't so pronounced that children would pick up on it but it overshadowed the story for me. I get it, as the movie says ""once big oil, always big oil.""

The movie did have some good lessons about friendship and the value of sticking by a friend and being loyal. I think this is what the kids will pick up on and that's a good lesson to learn. The voices are the same from the first movie and are generally entertaining. I think you kids will enjoy the animation and the action but more so for the under 7 crowd but there is a lot of cartoon violence with cars shooting at other cars trying to ""kill"" them.

Wow is this a BAD film.  I couldn't even finish watching it.  BAD!

The biggest problem is the focus on the tow-truck character of Mater.  Mater should be comic relief, not the main focus of the movie.  Too much Mater just gets irritating after awhile.

Also, enough of the pc brainwashing plots.  The plot in a nutshell - old clunker cars want to make a fortune on oil so they try to sabotage alternative fuels.  That's basically it.

Cars 2, like Wall-E, is at its core a movie about telling people what to think and how to live.  And like all movies build around a message, and not an actual plot, it fails miserably.

One of the worst kids movies I've seen.  Sorry - after that killer intro this was a pretty lame review.  Probably because the movie was just so poor that I just want to wipe the filthy taste of it out of my mouth and go on to something else.... Maybe bacon.  God I love bacon.  You know - if you really want to do a good job cooking bacon, you need to get the grease to what I call the ""dish soap"" phase.  The bacon is about done when the grease bubbles a bit like dish soap.  Oh... the best bacon I ever had was in Jamaica at a resort.  You wouldn't think that Jamaican bacon (that sounds sweet doesn't it... just sort of a ring to ""Jamaican bacon"") would be good...but I suspect it is at least as good as the Jamaican weed.  Big, thick slabs of bacon  - salty as heck too.  Uhhhhh.....",1322006400,6,1674,4.179245283018868

3641171,2,B001HN6922,"I'll keep this to a few main points that really bother me about this movie, since it appears I may be beating a dead horse with some of this.

Cars 2 retains none of the charm of the original Cars.  Last I checked, the target audience for this series was kids.  If that is still the case, then the utterly ridiculous ""British Spy Movie"" theme that the Disney people decided to go with is probably completely lost on their target audience.  Unless children have completely oblivious and irresponsible parents, then there is no way that any kid seeing this movie should know anything about James Bond.

Next, the over-the-top environmental messages that the audience is bombarded throughout the duration of this are nonsensical and have no place in what is supposedly a light-hearted kids movie.  I don't appreciate Disney trying to indoctrinate my kids with the idea that ""gasoline is EVIL!!"" and we should all be trying to use ""alternative fuels"" to power our cars.

Lastly, what in the h*ll is with all the guns, explosions, and violence?  Disney, have you forgot that you are a (thinly disguised)left-wing organization?  Have you forgot that left-wing people HATE guns?  Especially when it comes to guns and kids?  Yet somehow, it's perfectly acceptable for a supposed KIDS MOVIE to be FILLED with guns and violence.  Don't get me wrong, I love guns.  I'm a lifetime member of the NRA.  But, there is a time and place for guns.  A ""G""-rated kids movie is neither the time nor the place.  Really Disney??  Mater with two gatling guns strapped to him blasting away at a room full of cars??  Unbelievable.

I give it a 2 star rating only because, as usual with Pixar films, the animation is stellar.  The story line sucks, the message sucks, the violence is appalling, and it is absolutely NOTHING like the original Cars.",1321833600,5,1820,4.753993610223642
3641192,3,B001HN6922,"The top three rated reviews had really good points that I agreed with; here's my take.

The movie is visually stunning. I watched some special features ahead of time and learned about some of the graphical upgrades they made in this movie (over the first movie) and, as I watched the film, kept my eye open for the elements they discussed. It was a treat to look at. And it's true that they did an amazing job car-ify-ing the world - watching for all the subtle changes was a treat in itself.

As for the plot, well.... I'm not the kind of person that has to have unplumbed depth and intelligence in the movies I watch. Sometimes, you just want some fun. I felt that the plot of this movie is Good Enough; good enough to carry me through it without being totally bored, had everything tied together, and so on.

But I was watching it with my then-three year old son. He loved watching the original Cars movie, in which the scariest parts of the show were the gang of hooligans lulling Mack to sleep and then waking him up, and the 20-second clip of a combine chasing Mater & Lightning in a field. The meanest character was Chick Hicks, and his bad attitude was clearly condemned in the plot. The whole framework of the story was easily understandable by a 3yo, even if individual actions went over his head.

Because he loved the first movie so much, Cars 2 was the first movie we ever took him to see in the theater.
My son enjoyed the pratfalls even when he didn't ""get it"" (ie, Mater eating wasabi), and he enjoyed the car races and the fancy gadgets found throughout the movie. The question he asked the most, over and over, was ""Why did he do that?"" and ""Why did he want to do that?""

But Cars 2 is a spy film. There are bad guy cars who actually KILL other cars. My son didn't even know what a bomb WAS until this movie. Even after explaining it, he still can barely grasp the concept of alternative fuel, and certainly not ""alternative fuel that can be easily ignited"", let alone the concept that someone would purposely sabotage someone else. And the idea of introducing something dangerous so that consumers would be hurt and then driven to purchase the safer option, thus making the villian rich? My kid is barely old enough to understand the explanation of what a lie is, let alone this complex plot of lies layered on lies. And for what - to gain money? Again, even at 4, he still doesn't have a firm enough understanding of money to realize that some people lust after it enough to hurt others for it.

There were many other parts of the movie that we had to explain:
-Mater dressing up as another truck, so seamlessly that you couldn't see it was still Mater.
-Voice ""signature"" activation on the bomb (ie why only one person's voice would work)
-The inside of Big Bentley (sorry dudes, maybe we're uncultured swine, but he was only 3, we haven't had The Talk yet about what clocks look like inside and the fact that there's a really big clock in this one city we've never been to) and what it meant that the gears were going around (ie ""if those gears keep moving, Holley and Finn might get squished"")

And others that used up screen time but went right over his head and we didn't bother to explain:
-Why it was a problem that Francesco said he was faster than Lightning
-That all the bad cars were jealous of ""normal"" cars (because the bad ones were lemons and nobody likes them)
-Everything to do with IDing the bad guy:
---The kind of engine he used
---The kind of nuts/bolts for that engine
---Buying special parts for a particular engine
---What's a ""lemon"" engine
---Oil leaks

I could probably put another page-scroll worth of stuff, but I only saw the movie once and can't remember it all without googling it. The point is, your 3-, 4-, and possibly even 5-year-old is probably NOT going to understand MOST of what happened. You might as well put it on in another language, or on mute, because 75% of the dialogue and half the actions are just going to go right over their head no matter what. There are just so many things they haven't had to experience or learn about, and at the younger age, possibly not capable of understanding, even if they're really intelligent - some sorts of reasoning just don't blossom until kids are a little older (6, 7, 8 years old).

I still haven't decided whether I'll be getting the DVD for myself, because if it's in the house, I know he'll ask to see it. I realize this sounds as if I (and my son) didn't like the movie, and that's not true. Even completely ""not getting it"", he's totally enamored of the thing. But if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have taken him - I'd have just seen it by myself, and let him wait another 3-4 years.",1321833600,13,4703,4.390355912743972

3641228,1,B001HN6922,"As a parent who has watched the first Cars movie numerous times with an enthralled toddler, I'm confused by how this sequel came from that jem.  The first movie had a story line and moral value, where this monstrosity had neither, and where the story lacked substance, it made up for with action.  For a children's movie, the word ""die"" was mentioned numerous times, and cars were being purposely injured or killed.  Though ""moron"" was mentioned in the first movie, I heard more insults thrown in this one (i.e. ""idiot,"" ""dim-wit"").  The story was rushed with no character building, and the nemesis was obvious.  Though I'm sure my child wasn't interested in the fossil fuels vs. engineered alternatives debate, I feel this non-fictional subject was too mature for younger audiences.

Overall, I'm sure my child would love to sit and watch this movie again, maybe just as much as the first, but I refuse to keep it in my house another day.  I'm glad I rented it first vs. shelling out cash for this wreck of a sequel.  I recommend you rent it, too, before making this investment and decide for yourself whether it's worth adding to your collection; as I am, you may be glad you did.  As a conservative parent, lover of the first film, and sucker for investing money into the Cars franchise, I feel duped for even being excited for this movie to arrive in my mailbox, let alone watching it with my child.

3641229,3,B001HN6922,"Cars 2 is not that bad as it was projected when it was released. I had a sense from the reviews that the story isn't warm as the other movies of Pixar (re: Mater being put down by McQueen). However, this did not seem to be entirely true. This one has nicely written story, which values friendship indeed. Nevertheless, I cannot rate this as five stars as it lacks the identity of Pixar movies. Pixar has been known to be make extremely innovative, brilliant and highly entertaining animation flicks. Each time, Pixar just didn't make the movie, but actually created a whole new world and introduced an ultra-fresh concept and had been seldom repetitive. Take any flick from Monsters, Nemo, Cars, Incredibles to Wall E, every movie is as isolated as an island, yet remarkably brilliant and incredibly warm (humane). It's not an easy challenge to maintain. However, this is the exact thing gone missing in Cars 2. Without any innovation and depth, Cars 2 just remains a excellent animated movie, not a ""Pixar"" movie.
It is impossible not to compare this with original CARS, as it will not be judged by anyone as a standalone Pixar animated movie. Hence, here it is..
1. This one is more action-based than the first. The story resembles to a Bond movie, hence at times it appears as if the real actors are just given a 'car-face' to play. What I mean is, this movie isn't outstanding in terms of originality of animation, its more of a action movie plot played by animated characters.
2. The first one has better story and quality animation. Don't take me wrong, cars 2 animation is top-notch, but it's just an extension of the first one. However, I must give a standing ovation to the Tokyo, Italy and London they have created!
3. Cars 2 is waaay behind the original movie when it comes to real laughters. There is hardly any point where you will laugh aloud. Hence if you are considering this as a comedy option, just don't expect much.
4. Most characters are pulled from the original movie, this one has only one prominent character (mcmissile by Michael Cain), I couldn't think of any other.
All in all, Cars 2 is okay to see once, and it's perfectly fine to skip it if you love the original. It will not be too much to say that it's better to watch the first one twice than to spend a lot of money on this.",1321315200,2,2308,4.523923444976076

It's dark/scary, has lots of guns and bombs with characters saying ""I'm going to kill you,"" there are even parallels to water boarding.  WATER BOARDING!!!  This is such a highly controversial topic to begin with and Disney really felt it was appropriate to show the ""Bond"" car have liquid forced down his throat as torture??  Seriously?  Would you ever let your child watch a terrorist be tortured?  This movie is marketed for a very young audience (my son is 3 and a HUGE fan of the first movie).  On top of all the violence, there's the political message of cars consuming regular gas/fuel are ""bad"" and alternative fuel cars are ""good.""  I am all for using alternative fuel, but this subject doesn't even belong in a kid's cartoon!  If old Mickey Mouse episodes show a warning about possible offensive content then this movie should have had a warning that Disney was about to expose our children to politics and violent scenes.

But I can't accept that in a movie rated ""G"", there are multiple scenes of violence, death, even torture. I'll need to explain these concepts to my child at some point, but I'd certainly prefer that I be able to wait until he's beyond the age of four. I'll be explicit so that other parents who are considering this movie will know exactly what they're in for: there are several scenes in which the ""bad guy"" pointedly tells his subordinates to ""kill him"" (directed a Finn McMissile and Mater). There is a full-blown torture scene in which a car is restrained, heated to the pain point, and then destroyed (the actual death is shown only as a reflection). There are a lot of guns, bullets, and missiles. There's plenty of hand-to-hand (or wheel-to-wheel) combat, which seems like a picnic after the other stuff.
I'm not anti-violence, and I appreciate a good action movie. But I'm 35 and my kid is 4. We have different perspectives on life. When a movie is rated ""G"", I  expect something significantly less violent than James Bond.
The first Cars movie is among my favorites. It's a fantastic story that has a great message and doesn't rely on explosions. Are Pixar and Disney really so short of ideas that they need to blow things up to make money? Come on...I know they can do better.",1321142400,309,1462,4.496240601503759

3641235,3,B001HN6922,"From reading some of the reviews here, there is almost joy in condemning Cars 2 as not up to the impressive standard of previous Pixar films.  I think it is troubling to see the trend for people to take some much joy in seeing something fail.

Well Cars 2 isn't really a failure.  If anything, it is as good a sequel as could be expected.  The original Cars was arguably the weakest Pixar film before this one.  There is something about the concept itself not as sustainable for a full length story as talking ants, furry monsters or old toys.  Despite an incredible attention to detail and excellent work by animators, anthropomorphic automobiles for some reason just aren't that interesting to me.  This coming from a former career BMW mechanic. The in-jokes are all quite clever, but we're talking more smirk clever than laugh out loud. (Though David Hobbs popping up as a race announcer is a really nice touch.)

What Pixar has tried to do with this sequel is tap into the ""Incredibles"" style James Bond atmosphere and blend it with a ""vehicle"" for Mater.  The problems are multi-fold.  Michael Caine can only do so much and just isn't enough because there isn't enough jokes to keep Mater rolling. The Japanese toilet jokes are, however, hilarious and quite accurate if you have ever been there.  When you look at the plot, there is enough to go around for at least three movies and none of the ideas are completely developed.

That said, Cars 2 is not a failure or a bomb - it made $550 million dollars at the box office - but it is just a bit more episodic than the more thoughtful stories in other Pixar movies.  In the end, I think it is a more ambitious movie than the first Cars, but not any more entertaining.

It is a tall task to compete with aliens, robots, monsters, insects, toys or superheroes.  Cars 2 is entertaining, but when you start with a flat note, it's tough to really make it sing.",1321142400,,1909,4.508720930232558
3641236,4,B001HN6922,"Cars 2 is enjoyable and well-animated, but definitely suffers from sequel-itis; it seems so concerned with generating excitement that it feels overly manufactured. The plot centers around Lightning McQueen & Co. traveling to Japan, Italy and the U.K. for a series of three races against an Italian superstar racecar. McQueen brings along his best friend Mater, but Mater embarasses him, and they have a falling out. The races and Mater friendship storyline probably would have been enough for most kids, but entwined with this is a complex James Bond type plot, involving an alternative fuel company, a bunch of 'lemon' cars, and lots of mistaken identity. My kids, ages 5 and 7, couldn't really follow that at all. I'm not sure I completely did either! And the focus on the cast of characters involved in this plot means we don't get to see a lot of some of the original Cars characters, other than Mater and Lightning McQueen.

On the plus side, the friendship plot is touching, and having Mater overseas does create some amusing culture-clash scenes. Tokyo, Paris, the Italian Riviera and London are all beautifully rendered, stunning really. And the race scenes are lots of fun. So all in all, it was enjoyable, just not a home run like the first one was for me.",1321056000,,1266,4.8341013824884795

3641250,4,B001HN6922,"Walt Disney's childhood idyll of a farm family life is the stuff of legend and has influenced many a Disney film and theme park. I can also be said that John Lasseter's childhood of road trips in the southwest, small towns that no longer exist due to superhighways and a love of automobiles is directly attached to what is now two Cars movies.

Most critics have been less than kind regarding Disney*Pixar's Cars 2, but the public is clearly honing in on Lasseter's wavelength and responding with enthusiasm (and strong summer box office and huge DVD sales) for the sequel especially for Mater, who takes center stage in this family-friendly spy thriller.

In the -- THANK YOU!! -- audio commentary, Lasseter and co-director Brad Lewis offer lots of cool factoids as well as their reasoning behind the creative decisions.

Lasseter says, ""When we do a sequel, it's not just to retread the same emotional story that the original is. We want to find something new and something different."" Little of the movie takes place in Radiator Springs, but rather in colorful, exciting international locales that offer the Pixar artists a chance to dazzle with truly breathtaking aerial views and meticulous details, which I find most enjoyable in high-def Blu-ray (3-D is nice, but you lose some clarlty and I'd rather revel in the details).

Lasseter also mentions that the story for Cars 2 sprang from a scene in the first film in which Lightning and Sally (who is not given enough to do in the sequel) see a spy thriller at a drive-in. He loved spy movies as a kid, particularly likes the Bourne series and
bourne movies and believes that Cars 2 isn't a spy movie spoof so much as a solid story that can stand on its own.

I personally found Cars 2 to be a throwback to the spy shows and films that I grew up with, like The Avengers, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Secret Agent and even Get Smart. These were all somewhat comedic as well as thrilling (especially Smart of course) -- but of all the spy genre films, Cars 2 reminded me most of one of my favorites theatrical features, Hanna-Barbera's The Man Called Flintstone.

My I favor you with a parody of the unforgettable theme to this epic adventure, with special Cars 2 lyrics?

THE TRUCK CALLED MATER

Who do they call
When gears are startin' to fall
When all the oil is spillin'
And synth fuels beginnin' to brew?
The truck called Mater, that's who-oo-oo-oo!

Who's always there,
There to shoot and fly through the air
Who defeats Pacers and Gremlins
And all those cars we disliked too?
The truck called Mater, that's who-oo-oo-oo!

He screams after eating wasabi
Down to the lobby
To learn the charms
Of the Japanese joh-onnns!

Who is the truck
Who succeeds with mostly dumb luck
While his pal Lightning is winning
Who's spinning the crooks like fan belts?
The truck called Mater!
Who else, who else, who ELLLLLse!!

One final note on Cars 2 -- I drove a Gremlin in college and was hysterical with laughter that it and the Pacer were held is such comical ""esteem"" in Cars 2. They earned the distinction, to be sure.",1320969600,2,3062,4.639556377079482

It's entertainment and it does a wonderful job of entertaining. I am so fed up with people who have to complain about such a masterpiece just to make themselves feel important. I think they have all been brain washed by Michael Bay. I love most of his films but agree with what the guys said in Fanboys. All style and no substance. The edits don't have to be 3 per second to keep my attention. People are getting lazy about watching movies and if it don't constantly bash them in the brain with mindless sensory overload, they just about fall asleep. That's truly sad. Cars'2 delivers on the humor, the action, visuals of other countries that are breathtaking and a story that is easy to follow and has a positive message. To the person who complained about the cars threatening to kill other cars and how it was going to destroy their kids brains, trust me. Your kids have heard way worse than that on TV and even more so at school. Grow up and stop waiting for the world to sanitize everything for you. Mator has a much larger role in this film and I am so glad. McQueen is pretty much my least favorite character but I can take him or leave him. He don't destroy the show by any means. Pixar knew they had a wonderful character in Mator so they gave us more of him this time and I am SO glad they did. The scene in the Japanese restroom is fall out of your chair funny. The wasabi incident equally funny. Many little in jokes including a rare quote from the 60's Adam West Batman film where he says, ""If I could just reverse the polarity"". I bet very few people got that one. Pixar has huge amounts of time for the creators to come up with funny stuff and it surely shows. No film is perfect and everyone is entitled to their opinion but give Pixar a break and appreciate the endless hours that went into creating this wonderful movie that is suitable for the entire family. 5 minutes in, I knew it had to be part of my collection and I fully recommend it to all ages.",1320969600,2,2149,4.269607843137255

Those people must have been asleep at the wheel while the movie was running!  And I'm sorry I listened to the lemons vs. lemonade reviews.

I loved this movie as much as the first Cars and thought that the James Bond insider jokes and visual spoofs were sophisticated and extremely entertaining, as I've come to expect from Pixar. Once again, the Pixar team has come through and delivered a movie that's as much fun for adults as for most kids.

However, Cars 2 is definitely NOT for very young children or those who might be easily upset by the ""death"" of a character as the reviewer Freeman pointed out.  Although this still puts Cars 2 in the same company as Finding Nemo (mom dies by shark in the first few minutes) or Disney's the Lion King (dad gets trampled by a stampede) which to me seems much more ""disturbing"" than cars loosing wheels or the American spy car (cut away to save tender eyes) bursting into terminal flames.  Cars 2 is even more light-hearted than Toy Story 3's incineration scene that had men in tears...but I don't recall any criticism for the emotions the though of burning plastic caused otherwise reasonable adults (or their kids!)

Cars 2 is definitely worth viewing once, at the very least, but I recommend that you add it to your DVD/Bluray library if you're a fan of everything Pixar like I am.

How about the older (and even not so old) Disney movies, such as Bambi, Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Finding Nemo, Pocahontas, and Tarzan?

Parents dying (B and LK and FN), children dying (FN), wolf attacks and guns and intolerance toward those who are different(B&B), guns and shooting (T), people dying and racism (P).

Also, if I read it right the Digital Copy disc will be locked down to your computer. Yes singular computer, not computers.

A few words to Disney:
Make it easy to put movies that people pay for onto their computers, because if people start looking around to find out how to do it they will find out how to just download the movie for free. Not everyone is going to be as honest as I am trying to be. Dishonest people will be dishonest you can't keep them from doing it, they're smarter than you.

Some argue that it was a money grab, seeing as how Cars merchandise has been disgustingly popular with the kiddies. Others argue that... Well, okay, I haven't heard much in the way of a counterargument, considering Cars 2 went on to become the first 1 star movie for Pixar. This time around, Lightning McQueen and his buddy Mater do a bit of globetrotting for a World Grand Prix, during which Mater becomes unwittingly involved in an international espionage operation. Despite the film's fantastic visual flourishes, Cars 2 lacks compelling storytelling, making it possibly the first Pixar film not to appeal successfully to adults as much as children. The cast, which includes Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, John Turturro, and more, is great, though, and kids will undoubtedly love it, so there you go.",1320710400,5,1134,5.037234042553192
3641263,1,B001HN6922,"John Lassiter violates his own mantra of ""story first"" in this ""politically-correct"" pandering to the anti-oil lobby (mostly California-based, I presume).  I didn't mind (well, too much, anyway) the subtle anti-corporation message in Wall-E, but in Cars2 it was blatant.  This is particularly ironic (and hypocritical) since Lassiter came up with the story line for Cars1 while taking an extended vacation with his family in an RV!  Beyond the PC pandering, this movie was a flop since it had no ""tears-in-the-eyes"" moment (as did all of the other Pixar films - e.g., the scene in Cars1 when Lightning McQueen is leaving Radiator Springs after being outed by Doc Hudson - a real tear-jerker).  Further, the movie was a flop because: (1) things moved by too quickly for one to appreciate all of the subtle background art and automotive-related references; and (2) there was too much potty humor (e.g., Mater leaking oil during an episode of excitement).  This will be the first Pixar movie I do not buy on DVD.  I hope Lassiter and George Clooney enjoyed the picture, because (based on the reviews) most of the rest of us did not!",1320710400,11,1129,4.884816753926701
3641264,5,B001HN6922,"It seems that I never get tired of watching great computer-generated animation - Pixar style, that is. And I would venture to say that most everybody feels the same way. The colors and attention to detail are just amazing. It is more amazing, though, if the story is about cars, with no human-like characters involved. Yet, Disney does it again with the precious and delicious ""Cars 2.""

In this marvelous follow-up of the original, we again meet some of the main fellows (cars, trucks, etc) that we learned to love on the first installment of the franchise. This time, the story begins with Finn McMissile, a British secret agent on a mission on an oil platform at the high seas. He is trying to uncover a sinister plot by the bad guys. We are then taken to colorful Radiator Springs, home of our hero, Lighting McQueen and friends. He is taking a break from the racing circuit. Unfortunately for him, he is forced - thanks to an indiscretion of his buddy Mater -- to accept a challenge from Francesco, an Italian competitor. This adventure takes him to Japan, to the World Grand Prix. Lighting McQueen takes his pals to the trip, including Mater, his best friend. However, Mater involuntarily and mistakenly gets involved in the plot being investigated by Finn McMissile, ultimately affecting McQueen's opportunities at the race. This mishap will test their friendship, and in doing so, they also travel to France, Italy and England. Of course, like in any James Bond - type of espionage movies, there is plenty of action and a love interest, this time provided by secret agent Holley Shiftwell.

""Cars 2"" is fun from beginning to end, and the attention to detail, as I mentioned before, is just astonishing. All the European cities look just like postcards and it seems that the location coordinator did a fantastic job. Of course, being Japan and France important markets for Disney, it never hurts to do some free publicity for all parts involved. As always, can't wait for the next one! The Blu-ray + DVD includes director's commentary, ""Cars Toon: Air Mater,"" and more. Released November 4. 2011. (USA, 2011, color, 106 mins plus additional materials).

First this movie is not geared toward the young audience the first one was. The first Cars movie is great as well but geared toward 3-11 while this one is geared toward 8-16 years old.

Believe me when I say Pixar is all professional all the time and they do extensive research into their stories to make them look, feel, and conversate apropretely better then any other studio. People feel they missed the ball however if you watch interviews about it you will see they were aiming for a higher age with a faster pace and spy theme. They straight out say they didn't want to create a remake of the first.

I do have a child who is 4 and who just loves the first and really likes this second but I know she doesn't fully understand it and thats ok because as she gets older she will gain more appreciation for its storyline and not just its characters.

Bottom line its done very well with a good storyline and fantastic anamation however if you are wishing for a remake of the first you are not going to be happy. People downgrade it for the remake they wanted and not for the spy sequal they got.",1320624000,2,1262,4.2677824267782425

Seems like the characters didn't have much depth, but it's still greatly entertaining.  I'm not really understanding the one and two-star ratings here.

3641273,2,B001HN6922,"I, like many parents on here had 2 children who absolutely loved the first ""Cars"" movie.  What made that first movie so magical is that it could appeal to all audiences and didn't rely on cheap thrills or gimmicks to sell the story.  In short, it had a timeless message all could relate to much like most of Pixar movies do.  That is why it is so disappointing to rate Cars 2 so low after how wonderful the first one performed.

In short, Cars 2 plays down to the complex themes associated in the first one and relies on shock value and action to carry the movie which, are at times, inappropriate and superficial.  While I appreciated their reverence for older spy movies, I don't think it is an appropriate theme to play off of for a children's movie.  Cars trying to kill other cars didn't sit well with me.  I also thought there was a lot more 'potty humor' which I think is okay to have at times but was overplayed in this movie as another cheap humor tactic.  This overall direction revealed the shallowness of the movie and as I watched it with my child I felt like this movie wasn't created to say something, but moreso to cash in off of the profit and popularity of the first.  Looking at the characters, the familiar faces you thought would be reappearing were mostly bit parts save for Lightning McQueen and Mater (who actually is more the star of this movie).  At the end of the day, the movie felt more like a 'straight to DVD' and it lost a lot of the heart most Pixar movies tend to have.

While I have some very strong criticism of this film, it needs to be said that the graphics of the movie were once again top notch and that themes about friendship, although feeling like an afterthought, had good intentions.  I liked the new characters they were trying to introduce.  In the end, Cars 2 is a movie that lost its message and got caught up in the height of the first one which results in a movie with some great flash, but not a lot of substance.",1320624000,2,1966,4.309782608695652

3641276,4,B001HN6922,"Update:  We've watched this 5 times this first week--one being with the commentary.  Our 10 year old has requested that he have our first ever Disney Cars birthday party.

The mixed reviews almost kept me from purchasing Cars 2.  I do not review products very often, but I couldn't resist trying to help future purchasers make it through the jungle of opinions!
Here are my comments/kids' reactions (10, 8, 5, 2) to various compliments/complaints mentioned.

1.  Theme:  We like family movies with positive themes. Because of the reviews that said it was a waste of time-  or that there wasn't even a theme-I hesitated to buy Cars 2. I was pleasantly surprised! Who could miss the themes?  Many more positive lessons learned than in Cars 1.  Even our children picked up on the pervasive positive friendship theme (accepting your friends, competitors being friends, being a faithful friend) as well the self acceptance theme. Loved how Tow Mater, once he accepted himself, challenged others to choose happiness over jealousy . Appreciated the spy cars realizing Tow Mater's value underneath all of his rust.

2.  Plot:  Yes, a bit more sophisticated than Cars 1.  Perhaps this is why my husband and I didn't mind watching it on a Sunday afternoon, and then again on the same evening.  Our 10 year old enjoyed the mystery/suspense.  We didn't mind that it was a more intricate story line than Cars 1.  We probably prefer it.  It is full of action.
Perhaps our 5 year old didn't keep up with the plot/humor, but there were plenty of other reasons for her to stay interested.

3.  Setting:  Great fun to travel and experience other cultures with McQueen and Tow Mater.

3.  Audience:  Because of the plot, yes, I'd say it is aimed for a slightly older audience...but even our 2 year old enjoyed the boats and the water.

4.  Music:  Cars 1 music was overbearing for us.  I'd say Cars 2 was about as equally annoying with the music--about the same number of times we turned it down.

5.  Potty Humor:  I'm still thinking on this one.  Okay, I've thought...probably a bit much.

6.  Gambling/Alcohol:  Indeed, so unnecessary.  Of everything, this probably bothered us the most...having our heroes partake of these.  To have the diner in Radiator Springs now be a bar...discouraging.

7.  Sexual Innuendos: We forwarded through more of these in Cars 1.  What few there are in Cars 2 (1?) were mild in comparison.

8.  Violence:  Yes, lots of guns, shooting, spy chasing--but just resulting in crashing.  Our kids understood cars can be restored :) I will say our 10 year old was a bit disheartened at the torture scene--definitely could have left out the word ""kill"" here. Maybe before watching the first time, you might want your kids prepared some way.

9. Characters:  Our children enjoyed meeting new characters.  There were enough of the old ""friends"" included for them.

10. Political Innuendos:  Both kinds of fuel were presented positively and negatively.  No sinister motives here.  It was just a conflict to use for the plot.

11. Humor:  I can't count how many times we watched different parts to enjoy the laugh-out-loud humor.
Delightful!  Who can stop laughing at the monster truck?  And the voice activation humor?

12. Animation:  The international scenery and the spy chases were intriguing. This was perhaps my favorite part of seeing the movie--catching all the details.

13.  Worth the buy?  We enjoyed this ride even more so than Cars 1.  Perhaps it is a love/hate decision due to the touch of intense violence/gambling/drinking situations, but we felt we had to forward through as many or more details in Cars 1.  Otherwise, we laughed and wowed more in Cars 2.

I hope that any future Cars movies will be cleaned up a bit.  The need to forward through so many little parts keeps me from giving it 5 stars.

Don't miss the ride in case you might enjoy it!",1320624000,2,3870,4.78419452887538
3641277,4,B001HN6922,"Honestly other than a more complicated story line than the original movie, This movie is extremely enjoyable. My 3 year old had questions about why the race cars were ""broken"" and about why there were ""lemons"". Mater's character supplies more than enough laughs throughout the movie while co-star Finn McMissle supplies a lot of the action. The story line did seem a little hard to follow at times and would drift off story to gain a few cheap laughs. That's one of the main reasons I rated it 4 stars but I would never rate it any lower. As far as cartoon violence, I'm guessing you don't like your kids watch Wil-e-coyote or Tom & Jerry cartoons either? If you're not comfortable watching this cartoon with your kids, I recommend not watching classics like Bambi or the Lion King with your kids either.

Cars 2 was his first theatre experience, and as a parent I was pretty disappointed.  Two main reasons:

1.  This was shockingly violent.  I never expected to be sitting and watching thousands of bullets fly through the air and ""kill"" cars and trucks.  I'm not usually one who notices violence in films, but considering the fact that Disney has made boatloads of cash with licensed products for 3-4 year olds featuring Lightning McQueen, the violence was inappropriate.

2. The writers seemed to have become enamored with the Maters Tall Tales concept, and got carried away.  First of all the whole spy parody thing is totally over a young kids head, and frankly, even for the typical parent of a 3-5 year old, spy films aren't exactly relevant either.  My parents grew up on Bond films but not my generation.

All this being said, fast forward six month later and my then-just barely three-year old is now closer to being a four year old, and we've watched the movie again twice in two days on streaming video, and he loves it.  So what the hell do I know?",1320537600,,1158,4.567961165048544

Cars 2 however left a lot to be desired.  It still had many of the same characters as Cars 1, but really only Mater and Lightening are focused on.  Mater accidentally becomes a secret agent and finds himself in the middle of a massive investigation.

Kitsinger's review...why the viewers behind him seemed to hate it, was probably because they saw the same hidden messages in it that I did.  I doubt that it was their dismay over Bond movies...I myself, love Bond movies and can't wait for the new one next year.  No, it is the new Hollywood messaging system playing out upon unsuspecting viewers.  Oh, they are subtle enough, and most viewers probably wouldn't even notice, or care.  Did you even notice that the bad guys were Gremlins and Pacers?  Those are ""American Motors"" cars, or may I say, Hollywood's view that the bad guys in this world are Americans.  Cars 2 is not the only movie that Hollywood used to send along their viewpoints.  Did you notice that the Chinese were the heros in ""2012""?  At the end (the last scene)of the movie ""Knowing"", did you notice the tree that the little boy and little girl ran towards?  It is a reference to the Bible's ""Tree of Knowledge"", or, ""time to pick the fruit and let the sin begin"".  There is no reason for Hollywood to use these images, as others, or none at all could be substituted, but it is becoming clearer to me that Hollywood is getting their message out, and we're standing in line willing to pay for it.  I am sure there are other things I missed in current movies, but I am sure the viewers behind J. Kitsinger saw what I saw, which spoiled the whole movie for them.  As for myself, I just make note of it.  I gave the movie one star because of this.  Hollywood gripes about political correctness yet they throw it back on us, the viewers.  Hollywood needs to get out of politics and religion, and just concentrate on entertainment like they did back in the beginning of motion pictures.

Another is that some parents with kids felt the movie was not ok for all kids.  Fair enough.  But why rate it so low just because it was not a match for your kids?

Another complaint may have been that Mater was the star.  Why not?  LGC is hilarious.  I am not into his brand of comedy, but that doesn't mean he's not hilarious in Cars 2.

Here's why I love this movie-
* It's funny; Really
* The graphics are probably the best I have ever seen
* As a kid I loved James Bond, especially the gadgets - and that's what you get here, a funny homage to Bond
* The movie DID have a message; How did you miss it?? (for those who seem to have missed it)
* I love auto racing, especially Formula 1 auto racing (For those American who don't know F1, it's the most prestigious racing series in the world, with all those foreign names you can't pronounce taking place in cities you may never have heard of) - and this movie celebrates auto racing, especially F1
* The plot was fine - could have been better, but you can rarely have it all (Unless you are the people who did Kung Fu Panda of course, who made the perfect CGI movie - lightning rarely strikes twice like that)

Other films would have made for better sequels.  Perfect example 2004's The Incredibles.  You could have had a story there.

McQueen back in Radiator Springs.  Next race & he takes Mater & other with him.  BUT, the rest of the story.  2 time Oscar winner Michael Caine could have phones the voice work in on a role he can do in his sleep.

So, if you have invested in the latest equipment, you must dive into the Languages menu to get 24-bit 7.1 audio. That's a huge bummer and likely the result of sloppy work over at Disney Home Video.",1320451200,,411,4.269230769230769
3641299,1,B001HN6922,"Saw this movie in the theatre with our son.  It was the first time we took him with us to the theater.  Cars 1 was great and had a lot of good messages but this movie was all about politics and pushing an agenda on the younger generation.  The plot of the movie was weak and seemed to me that the storyboard was centered around brainwashing children that oil is bad.  My boy still enjoyed the movie because he was really still too young to pick up on the political agenda and just liked watching mater fly around with a jetpack.  I have to say this video will fit well in your collection if you're a bleeding heart liberal and are planning on raising your children to be also, otherwise i'd say skip it.  It seems like the folks at pixar are trying more each time to leverage their grasp on children to push their views on society.

p.s. to the writers at pixar,

I know this is silly but it still bothers me every time i watch wall-E when the captain's wheel tilts the spaceship IN OUTER SPACE all the people go sliding across the floor.  Explain to me how the artificial gravity system in that ship works.",1320451200,8,1107,4.258373205741627

I use to love watching the hours of great looks behind the scenes Pixar use to include on their DVD and Blu-rays. With each release they become skimpier and skimpier. One Mater Tale, which is only a commercial for the new Pixar show ""Planes"", the Toy Story short, and a director commentary, that's it! I feel short changed. We use to get tours of Pixar, got to sit in on story conferences, deleted scenes, concept art ect. I guess they are saving that for the double dip. Pixar use to be all about bang for the buck, since Disney took over they seem to only be about the buck.",1320364800,,651,4.300813008130081

The reason I love dvds so much is because I really enjoy the special features.  If there aren't special features, just give me the VHS.  Since most releases now require the more expensive purchase of a Blu-Ray disc too, in order to view special features, I went this route.  My major disappointment is that the only special features on either disc are two shorts and the commentary during the film.  What gives?  I just saw the new configuration of Amazon's product page with the comparison of the options that shows you can get all kinds of features if you spend even MORE money for the five disc combo with the digital copy etc.  I'm looking at my vast collection of movies, and through the years I have spent over a thousand dollars buying them.  I think this is more geared towards the powers at be who make the packaging decisions, though I wasn't as impressed with the movie as I thought I would be considering its reviews.

Edit:
My son complained the first time viewing the Blu-Ray that it started all over again.  I thought he was just playing with the clicker.  In two more viewings, the disc has randomly stopped a started from the beginning on its own.  I think this will be returned.",1320364800,,1365,4.5

Cars 2 is the second film, besides Toy Story, to become a sequel. Unfortunately, the movie has recieved mixed reviews all over. Everyone claims this is Pixar's first misfire with their animated films. I'm not as convinced as others that this movie is so bad. It doesn't have the emotional impact that the first movie has but it is a fun movie. Whatever possessed them to make a spy movie out of the Cars universe is beyond me but, for what it is, it actually worked and turned out to be a pretty good movie to me. It's not great but it isn't godawful either(if I had to pick another Pixar movie that I felt was godawful, it'd have to be Finding Nemo-even though that one did well at the box-office). On a technical level, Cars 2 is the best looking Pixar movie to date.

Given Pixar's track record with movies(even if people do consider this to be bad), they deserve one misfire- they're only human. We all make mistakes. The important thing is we learn from our mistakes. In my opinion, Cars 2 is a winner so don't let these bad reviews persuade you otherwise.",1320364800,3,1218,4.506787330316742

Pixar has never been more off the mark.  The first film was funny for kids and adults, with jokes appropriate for all age levels.  Cars 2 was violent and offensive.  My son asked to leave after 20 minutes and I wish we had.  We stayed, thinking it was just the theater experience he had to adjust to, then they had cars beating up another car in the bathroom!  The whole film was uncomfortable to watch with a 4 year old.
I was happy that they made reference to losing Paul Newman and there were obviously a few funny things, but overall, this movie is not appropriate for the same age group as the first movie. Definitely screen this movie before family movie night or you could have some upset children.",1320364800,6,865,4.436708860759493
3641306,2,B001HN6922,"I take no pleasure when I say that Cars 2 is the most disappointing movie I've seen since Shyamalan's The Last Airbender. It's not the worst movie of the year, (Transformers 3 has a death grip on that dubious honor) but when it comes to Pixar films, I expect a lot more.

Cars 2 asks the question, ""What would Hitchcock's North By Northwest be like if Cary Grant was super annoying and shallow?"" Mater was a perfectly fine sidekick in the original Cars, but here in a lead role he is grating. Just about all of his ""jokes"" are cringe-inducing. At one point he sings the State Farm Insurance jingle with some replaced words. I audibly groaned. Beyond his schtick, there's not much too him. He spends most of the movie bumbling around, either accidentally foiling the bad guys' evil plot or being saved at the last second by someone else. Then late in the movie they try and give Mater some depth by interjecting ""Be yourself"" themes. This is probably the standard go-to theme to put into kids movies. It's been done a million times. For this theme to even have a shot at working, you have to like the protagonist. I didn't like Mater and subsequently it didn't work for me.

It's not all bad. The action scenes are fun, sometimes even downright visceral. The opening scene in particular is thrilling. And occasionally, I did chuckle. The batting average for the humor is low, but it's not .000.

Overall, Cars 2, following it's protagonist's lead, is a very shallow experience. There is no subtext, all of the themes are said repeatedly by all of the characters, it is never surprising. And I know, the defense is this is a kids movie and it's okay for kids movies to be shallow. I would agree to an extent, but that's not the light I viewed Cars 2 in. This is a Pixar film. Their last four films are not only some of the best kids films of all time, but were also some of the best films of any kind of the last four years. To regress to being simple ""kids films"" is unfortunate. Hopefully next summer I'll be raving about how awesome Brave is and Cars 2 will be a slightly depressing memory.",1320278400,4,2091,4.440104166666667
3641307,5,B001HN6922,"My kids and I love it! I have a autistic 6 year old son and a 3 year old daughter. It's like a james bond movie but there IS a postive message. Many people have said there isn't any substance and any feel good moments in it but there is. Lightening Mcqueen gets embarassed of Mater and yells at him because he is being himself (goofy, and accident prone) around sophisticated people. Later Mcqueen becomes remorseful for treating Mater like that when he finds a note from Mater that he is going home.  Mater is sad because everyone sees him as a goofball and no one takes him seriously. He learns it's ok to be yourself and not to change. Mcqueens lesson is you can't be best friends with someone behind closed doors (only in radiator springs) and then be ashamed of them out in the open. If you like them, then you accept them for who they are all the time.
 My kids loved all the action and racing. I liked it because it's a fun movie to watch. Some people need to lighten up with their reviews. It's a kids movie and it seems parents are expecting to enjoy it more than their kids, and when they don't then they write bad reviews.

3641309,2,B001HN6922,"Wow! I usually can assume that all Pixar animation is going to be unique and fun and enjoyable to the whole audience. 'Cars 2' was a vast disappointment. I mean, what was director John Lassiter thinking? 'Cars 2' resembles something Disney just a few years ago may have sent packing to straight-to-DVD (see 'Cinderella II'). Despite many of the original cast members returning (minus the late Paul Newman), and a new voice, Michael Caine, 'Cars 2' reminds me of a mediocre 100-minute Matchbox commercial. I used to own a number of toy cars when I was a kid. I would pretend all kinds of things with them, even having them fall off cliffs. Lassiter apparently is pretending the same way a kid would pretend, except he messes it up. There is an inept storyline, bad dialogue, very little funny humor, and no memorable characters (Owen Wilson's red car plays second fiddle to Larry the Cable Guy's tow truck - whoopie!). I know, this movie was made for kids so that Disney and Pixar can sell more merchandise. I got that. I remember how successful other Pixar movies were like 'Toy Story 3' (great story, great characters), 'Finding Nemo' (great story, great characters), and even the original 'Cars' (great story, great characters). And they sold tons of merchandise. Why make a $200 million movie that spend's little time on story or characters or good dialogue or humor? Somebody at Pixar has gotten lazy. The studio's winning streak has ended. 'Cars 2' is not a good movie. Not just by Pixar's standards as some people suggested, but by animation's standards wherever it comes from. It was almost as bad as 'Shrek the Third', the abomination of all of the 'Shrek' movies. Not as bad but almost. Too bad. Pixar's next film, 'Brave', looks good, and will take us away from sequelitis for a change. I can only hope that 'Brave' will begin another Pixar streak of great animation.",1320278400,5,1877,4.7607361963190185
3641310,5,B001HN6922,"I think the biggest thing that comes along with any sequel is that people tend to tie it in and compare it to the first movie.  Just as when moviegoers try to compare a movie to a book it was based on, they will often be disappointed.  So I have taken the standpoint that when I see any movie, with any familiar actor, book tie ins, sequels or prequels, that I compare it strictly to itself and the experience of watching the movie.  In other words:  I stay open-minded, and refrain from expectations.  So for me, this movie was a lot of fun!

My 7-year old daughter was about 3 or 4 when she first saw the original Cars movie.  So we own it and watched it the week before Cars 2 came out, to get ""in the mood"".  Mind you we've seen Cars so many times, that we can both randomly quote lines verbatim.  We also own the soundtrack and we can both tell you where each track is played in the movie, and know all the words.  LOL.  So trust me, we loved the first Cars movie.  That being said... WE STILL LOVE THIS NEW MOVIE!  It is adventurous (something a 7-10 year old appreciates), silly, still maintains the heart of the original characters, but gives a new exciting story line.  I mean really, I'm sure some of you parents might also be tired of the original story at this point, and probably can appreciate a new movie concept that still has characters your child can identify with.

Anyway, Cars 2 is very entertaining, and we will buy (we've had it on pre-order with Amazon for two months) it and we'll watch it repeatedly too.  LOL.  Unlike Toy Story 3 (my daughter owns the first two, and hated #3), which we won't be buying.",1320278400,2,1630,4.2745098039215685

Our younger grandkids had no real interest after we watched half the movie and the older grandkids were bored to no end and so were we, and we were huge fans of the first Cars movie.

3641315,5,B001HN6922,"Ok, I just saw the film after reading the bad reviews here and all I have is one question: how many versions of Cars 2 came out this year? The version I just saw was terrific! And I'm talking about the STORY as well as the animation, which, by the way, is the best I've seen since Rango, another unappreciated film that's a little ahead of its time, but now I want to focus on Cars 2.

Basically, it's 2 stories: one, a spy story centered around cars running on alternative fuel blowing up in various races around the world; two, the importance of staying true to and defining yourself, specifically, this one's about Tow Mater who, during a trip to the toilet, becomes tangled up in an international conspiracy with 2 British spies.

This is a terrific film and I think that the problem people have with it is that it's a little more sophisticated than the first film. As a previous reviewer pointed out, this is more of an evolution from the first film than a sequel. I mean, if a 12 year old kid can download apps to his iphone or ipad he or she shouldn't have a problem understanding this film, which is very basic in comparison. The film has absolutely incredible eye-popping visuals. I rented it on DVD and I will get the blu ray later this week, that's how beautiful it is. The fact that it also has a very decent story and drew a few chuckles out of me is enough. Like I said, don't know what all the negative reviews are about.

The plots concerning Mater feeling out of the loop and about ""big oil"" can be very confusing to little children - obviously, this is meant to appeal to older kids and adults. I really don't understand how Disney/Pixar got away with a G rating when the content in this movie is obviously more for a PG film.  Other Pixar movies such as 'Up' (not to mention the Dreamworks animated films) have made great profits with PG ratings... what made Cars 2 exempt?

In regard to the dvd itself, there are very few frills included - you have to upgrade to the blu-ray and 3D blu-ray to get the majority of the extra features.

Just what is Lightning McQueen?  A race car, not a golf cart.  And the villain in this movie?  A character who will profit from ""Big Oil"".  The very first scene is hundreds of oil platforms with smoking flares.  Give me a break!  What is ironic is that Pixar's DVD is made from polycarbonate.

Anyway, the second movie, Cars 2 is better than the first one if we are open minded, not too demanding that the movie should follow the same concept and atmosphere of the first one. It has a great story and deep messages such as ""friendship (actually, any kind of relationship, not just friendhsip ;p) is more important than any earthly accomplishment or quarrel"", "" be ourselves"", ""not everything is what it seems"", ""loyalty"", ""trust"", etc. then it also has great Bond-like action sequences, awesome comedies and details in culture and as in any other Pixar movies, the animation is just stunning!!

I understand that some people don't like it for their reasons, like too many ""deaths"" of cars or thread of ""deaths"" or just leave the Radiator Spring characters and atmospheres behind, but again, we should accompany and educate our children anyway when we watch movies, if we want a totally kid-appropriate then stay with PBS kids or other children programs and also let the Disney Pixar team have fun venturing their characters out of their hometown atmosphere, it'll give a fresh atmosphere and colors to the main characters they choose and how they react to these new environments, sometimes this idea works well and sometimes not, but for me, it works very well, this put this Cars 2 to my top list with ""The Incredibles"", ""Megamind"", ""Monster Inc."" etc.

Honestly, for me, this movie might fit better for the adult audiences than the yonger audiences, since the spy story, the scheme the bad guys plot, even some of the jokes are migth only be understood by adult audiences. The adults will have to explain to their little ones what's going on and why. If not, 90% the younger audiences/children will get bored when there are no carricature jokes, no racing or no fighting. My 5 yr old son kinda got bored, too, when the first time he watched this. After watching it again on DVD, I can pause the movie, explain some plots and jokes first then continue with the movie, he understood more and got more excited to continue watching it (*v^)//

First movie, more for kids and younger audiences, second movie, more for bigger kids and adult audiences. Hope this help.

And in fact, after watching again, some of the cars that got their engines blown out did in fact re-appear in the next race, just like real life where you put a new engine in a car if it blows.  Yes, the story is complicated but that is a plus for me - there is something for everyone.  My kids who are 8, 5 and 2 all get something different out of it at their own level of understanding, and so do I(a huge Bond fan so maybe this was just up my alley!).

3641340,3,B001HN6922,"The first Cars movie from 2006 was one of Pixars best movies. It had a great plot, outstanding visuals and an excellent soundtrack. Only outstanding visuals can be said for the sequel. Rather than one plot it seems as if there are two and the sloppy transitions between storylines affects the flow of the entire movie. The first movie was mainly about McQueen and him discovering that there was more to life than being rich and famous. In the sequel McQueen travels the world with his friends and competes with the world's best race cars. This storyline was pretty cool but then his buddy Mater gets dragged into a spy thriller mess. It is basically about gangsters and corrupt businessmen sabotaging the World Grand Prix race that Mcqueen is competing in. While this storyline provided for some of the movie's best moments and introduces some cool new characters, it just seems out of place. I also found that a few scenes were a little too-much for Disney's G rating. Multiple character deaths and implied death take some of the fun out of the spy storyline. As for the soundtrack nothing caught my attention. From the first Cars I was able to grab about 5-6 tracks and listen to them on an MP3 player but with Cars 2 I honestly didn't care for a single song throughout the whole movie. This movie is fun for kids and I had a bit of fun watching it but as far as a quality movie it is a bit of a disappointment. Pixar is responsible for some of the best movies ever and they are certainly capable of alot more.",1319846400,2,1512,4.481884057971015
3641341,2,B001HN6922,"This movie is a bit of let down, especially after the fun adventure and coming of age story that we had to deal with though the use of a small town the first go around.  Instead of continuing on with what was established in the first, we get what pretty much comes off as a movie to be used as a cash cow of sorts to sell toys based around all the new characters introduced in this film.

No longer about a small town and the other cars in it, now this movie focuses around  a world wide race that Lightning McQueen has been selected to participate in. And of course, since we have to have some side kick comedy , Mater somehow tags along for the ride.  And mix in a lot of new faces and cars to the fold and you have again what comes off as a weird toy advertisement from start to finish that is by far the worst film the Pixar company has ever released.

We have a movie that could have been the first in the series for all anyone viewing it can tell. It is about random cars in a race in three seperate countries with a weird side story of some Hummer type vehicle running said race wanting to use the race as a way to spread the word of his new more eco friendly fuel. The foils to the story are the reject and lemon based cars who are jealous of all these other cars having all the success and luck in life that they want to sabotage the race with the use of some ray gun that will over heat the new fuel in these race cars and cause the fuel to be a complete failure. A very weak story all around that never really goes anywhere and seems to get stranger and more ridiculous as the movie goes on.

New characters include secret agents who are trying to stop the evil cars from exploding the race cars like Finn McMissile the British based, James Bond wanna be who  somehow mistakes bumpkin Mater for the US based secret agent where 'ha ha hijinx' ensue.  Female secret agent Holley Shiftwell who provides the female focus of this story with Mater being the focus of her affections and Miles Axelrod and Professor Zundap playing the rolls of the foils for this film.

What was missing here was the old favorites from the first.  Doc Hudson has been retired from the series due to real life death of voice actor Paul Newman which of course was understood. But we had really no Sally, Ramon, Sheriff..etc at all in this film. When they do show up it was forced and squeezed in just because they had to be somewhere in the film but served no purpose.  The story was weak and definitely the worst part of the movie. The new characters aren't so bad, but the plot is so poor they too seem to serve no purpose but to again be there just to sell new character figures in the toy stores.

The charm and fun that the first had is long gone in this second go around. It's a very by the books, standard, milk the fans for as much as you can type of film and that's exactly how it comes off as you are watching it. You will enjoy maybe a few moments here and there but Cars 2 is a movie me and my family won't be watching again any time soon.  Next time make a made to TV series if this is what you want to do with the franchise because there was no effort put in this one and it's such a shame too that it all came off like this as the first one actually pulled this all off well. This movie on the other hand set the franchise back for a long time to come and it may never truly recover.

Weak plot, weird situations, toy selling device and unenjoyable rushed experience. Even the ending makes one wonder what was the point of all we just watched in the film.  Avoid avoid avoid. Sorry Pixar. This film is definitely running with a flat tire.",1319760000,3,3637,4.117231638418079

3641343,4,B001HN6922,"It's an odd addition to the ""Cars"" name, but an abundance of humor, action, and beautiful visuals show just how unappreciated ""Cars 2"" really is.

You know something, I've never really understood why people always told me that ""Cars"" was the worst Disney Pixar film ever made. From what I've read, the story isn't as appealing as other works in the Disney Pixar line up, and friends tell me they just didn't care for the characters. I, of course, am in the minority of audience members who fell that ""Cars"" is no different in terms of charm and lovability from the rest of Disney Pixar's film line up. I've always stuck to my guns claiming that ""Cars"" is just as amazing as the likes of ""Toy Story"" or ""Up"", because I found myself learning to love the characters of the ""Cars"" world, and felt the story was both endearing and charismatic. Then came the poor reviews for ""Cars 2""; a movie I had been greatly anticipating since it's announcement. Again, everyone was saying the story was nowhere near as well done as previous entries in Disney Pixar's movie line up; and I was completely bummed. It almost made me not even bother seeing it at all; since I felt it would ruin the built up reputation I posses in my head of how amazing each and every Disney Pixar film. I know when you're trying to be a good movie critic, one mustn't allow themselves to be swayed by public opinion, but I just couldn't help but feel a little let down; even before I saw the film itself. Thankfully, I finally built up the nerve to ignore the harsh reviews and sit down at the Cinema Center to watch it myself. I decided to just clear my mind of the bad publicity, and just watch it with the open mind a good critic should posses. From what I have gathered from the reviews other critics have lined before me and from what I personally saw in ""Cars 2"", I know now that overall public opinion should never dictate whether you choose to see a film or not. ""Cars 2"" is, in fact, an amazing piece of art from the Disney Pixar team. ""Cars 2"" has almost all of the original characters from the first film, excluding Doc Hudson because of Paul Newman's death. This time around, Lightning McQueen has won 4 Piston Cups since his first attempt in the first film, and is planning on taking a break from the racing world to pal around with his best friend Mater, and to spend quality time with his girlfriend Sally. When Mater hears of the news that Lightning rejected an entry opportunity to participate in the first ever ""World Grand Prix"", and additionally hears Lightning's rival Francesco's mockery of McQueen, he calls in to the news broadcaster to personally tell Francesco how well Lightning would mop the floor with him. This, subsequently, forces Lightning to accept the entry offer and participate. The World Grand Prix has all drivers completely powering themselves with a new alternative fuel source called Allinol; and major fuel tycoons are trying to stop the fuel from making a huge public splash for patrons to turn away from gasoline. The threat that lies within the race is all too dangerous, and British spies Finn McMissile and Holly Shiftwell are there to figure out who specifically is causing all this chaos. After accidentally mistaking Mater for their American counterpart, Mater is thrown into a world of action and espionage to help Finn and Holly figure out what's truly going on behind the races. Mater tries to do his best for both the spy team, and Lightning, but begins to feel like he's more of a problem than actual help. In order for everyone to succeed, Lightning must set away his pride, Finn and Holly must do whatever's necessary, and Mater must look within himself to be the great car he knows he really is. After everything I had read on why ""Cars 2"" was so bad, I found myself completely shocked to see that there was really nothing wrong with the film at all. The story may be the strongest ever, but it still holds itself very well because of the still lovable Pixar characters and exotic locations. The visuals are even better than the previous ""Cars"" entry, and it's even funnier as well! The fact that so many critics were so willing to pan this film amazes me; there's no change in my admiration for how well Disney Pixar makes a good film. Everything from music, to story, to characters fits well with the name, and I don't see myself falling for the critical buzz again. Now, let's point out something really quick though. I do understand when some say this Pixar movie doesn't have the same amount of charm behind it; I do somewhat agree here. When comparing it to the previous ""Cars"" in terms of charm, it doesn't have the same amount and uses a more mature kind of charm with itself; sort of like Up's charm, although I do feel Up was better. This film actually deals with cars dying throughout it; which you would expect from a spy type film, but I didn't really see it coming with a Pixar one. It doesn't hamper it in any way, but I just though I'd point it out. Oh, and one last thing before I give a final summary if how much I liked ""Cars 2"". What I mean by, ""An odd entry"", is that the whole spy theme going on in this entry feels like it could have easily been used in a different Pixar film; like a new film series about spies. I don't know why they used it specifically for ""Cars"" and to make a ""Cars"" film surrounding it, but nevertheless, it's still a well done film overall. So to sum everything up, ""Cars 2"" is a highly under-appreciated Disney Pixar film. Story, visuals, characters, music, scenery, and so much more I felt was done right and just wasn't noticed as well as it should have been by so many others. Besides, it's about talking cars that can fly, swim, and do karate; what can you possibly hate about a movie that has that? It's nowhere near predictable and anyone who looks past the negative reviews surrounding it will find the same amount of Disney Pixar charm they've come to know and love with the other entries they've done so well.",1319587200,3,5988,4.4986225895316805
3641344,1,B001HN6922,"After wearing out one disc of ""Cars"", we are on our second one.  My 2 year old son absolutely loves Mater and ""Stickers"".  With sheets, comforter, toys, movies, wall clings, and recently slippers shaped like Lightening that walks around in going vroooom, we decided this would be his first movie.  We waited until the 3rd or 4th week it was out, and went on a Sunday afternoon.  To make it better, there was only 2 other families in there, with children about the same age.  When Mater first showed up, the two other children and my son all screamed and hollered.  I thought this is going to be great.  Something he will enjoy.  It wasn't.

As other reviewers have stated this is a movie produced by left wing Hollywood.  Green is good and oil is bad.  I am fine with messages being in movies, anyone remember Bambi, but this one went way too far.  Children's movies lately have been a good mix of action, excitement, stellar animation, and just enough adult humor.  The adult humor is sly enough the kids do not realize it, hence Shrek or the first Cars (""Doc did what in his cup?"").  This one tried way too hard to get the adult element into the storyline.  It seems they made this movie for adults and the 12-15 year old age group that would have been young when the first Cars came out.  Kind of like a storyline that grew up with the original viewer.

Keep it simple movie makers.  Family movies that make our young children laugh and giggle.  That we enjoy sitting down on the weekends and watching as a family.  Do kill the innocence in our youth with propaganda over and over.  Do not use your liberal agenda to influence children's movies.  Hoped this review helped just one person.",1319587200,9,1691,4.475409836065574
3641345,5,B001HN6922,"Like a lot of other reviews, I was counting the days down with my 4-year old and 2-year old.  This was the first time he marked the days on the calendar and we went.  We loved it.  We saw it three times.  As for the violence, come one, really?  I hate guns and don't have them, but this movie was in context, it was a James Bond movie with talking cars.  No nudity, no language, and there were several messages that I have talked about with my kids.  The animation was great, the sound was great, it was well produced - is it Pixars ""best"" no, but a lot better than other things on the market over the last few years.  I have no problem having my kid look to Lightening and Matter as heros - infinitely better than Shrek or Kung Fu Panda.  As far as violence, I won't let them watch ""The Incredibles"" because though I liked the movie, it is not appropriate yet.

Now let's talk about the animation genre.  It is not just for kids.  In my opinion, what made Pixar great is the weaving of adult interest with kid friendly story telling.  Toy Story 3 - which I thought was horrible, and my kids have never played with or shown interest in a buzz toy since, was totally an adult movie.  Just because something is animated doesn't mean it is for kids.  Have you seen cable animation lately?  I like the Cars franchise including the short clips we watch on the new Disney Roku channel.  As with everything, parents needs to be engaged with their kids, talk about the messages they see, and make decisions.

From time to time, we go to the movies for entertainment.  Cars 2 is very entertaining with lots of eye candy.  My kids have not increased their violence but they love playing with their Cars.",1319500800,2,1693,4.314285714285714

3641347,4,B001HN6922,"Just a quick review to say that I too liked Cars 2 better than the original, which was long on whining and maudlin Hudson backstory.  Don't get me wrong: I liked the first one, but I loved the second, which introduced two great new characters (Finn and Holley), suggesting an indefinite franchise (yay!), and made Mater, who is more complex than Lightning, the star.  The situations and what Mater says and does in response to them are hilarious!  The plot twist at the end is a genuine surprise, hard to pull off these days.  The genius social commentary disguised by car puns continues.  The ONLY reason I didn't give it five stars is that I don't think a ""G""-rated film should have a character (car or not) being tortured and murdered, even off screen.  While it is true that youngsters might not pick up on that, many will, and I found it disturbing to watch with my four-year-old daughter (our first movie in the theaters together).

The second movie was awful.  Just aaaaaaaaaaawful!  My son couldn't sit still, we went to the theatre and he hated the whole thing, start to finish.  I'm someone who really does not enjoy Michaal Cain - and when I tell you that he was my favorite part of the movie - that should speak volumes.

What a bust for Pixar.  Who fell asleep at the helm of this project?!?

There's death and violence in the real world, kids should be prepared to accept death as natural part of life, blah blah blah"". But what's the message in this movie? Bad people lose, good looking people win? That's the Disney motto, not Pixar's. This sequel does not compare to the Toy Story sequels if you're going to name other sequels made by Pixar.  The original plot was about character development, friendship, being humble, recognizing ones faults and growing up.  This movie is just an action movie not a family movie. I was disappointed to see that John Lasseter contributed to the story of this movie and it is a shame since this movie differs so much from the first one that one can only think that he was ordered to produce a sequel. Mr Lasseter, if you're not on the Board you just are an employee; forget whatever title they give.  If the movie does not sell you'll be held accountable and fired a second time from the same company. Seems that the winning streak of Pixar has ended. Better luck next time.

Let it be consigned to the list of terrible sequels along with such dregs as Highlander 2 and The Chronicles of Riddick and The Return of Jafar. The first Cars was kinda mediocre, but still fun and sweet in its own way, if not terribly compelling. This is not a Pixar film. It's a studio film, coutesy of Disney. It had good toy sales, so it got a sequel, a sequel where every decision was a bad one (""Hey, let's take the most annoying character and just go off the rails on a ridiculous spy adventure and forget the whole cars and racing and freedom of driving thing""). Pixar is bar-none my favorite. My favorite movie is Wall-E, and I'm 30! The Incredibles was the first movie I actually went to see twice in the theater. UP still makes me shed a tear in the first 10 minutes. We just watched Finding Nemo in the hospital while my wife was recovering from her C-section.

Visually, Cars is impressive, but who cares! Plenty of terrible movies look great. For all the action, I was bored out of my skull and just wanted it to end. I have a hard time bringing up specific complaints because I've worked so hard to forget this movie. If you want to watch a decent animated British mystery/conspiracy movie, just watch The Great Mouse Detective. Much better movie. In fact this was pretty much the worst animated movie of the year (with the highest production value). With Pixar, story is usually king, which is why I like them. I'm a writer, I like good stories. But the story was just some incoherent crap based on a marketing jam session shoehorned into this execreble beast of a film. I would dissect it, but there's no point. It's a pile of garbage that makes no sense, yet was somehow ridiculously predictable. Even Owen Wilson must feel some embarassment for having to play second fiddle to a Larry the Cable Guy spy thriller in his own movie.

My main complaint was that this movie was no better than what competing studios like Dreamworks put out. In fact the other studios put out FAR BETTER MOVIES this year (Kung Fu Panda 2, Rio, Rango...). Sad to see Pixar get trounced by virtually everyone out there. FOR SHAME!!! This is loving discipline. Pixar is great, we know what it's capable of, it showed us what animated movies could be! Don't reward bad behavior. Deny Disney any revenue from this film. Don't buy it, don't buy any associated products for your kids. Reward good behavior, good movies. Go buy any of the other animated films that came out this year instead. Let this one die.

Aside from the fact that story drags and is nowhere near as interesting as Cars 1, Pixar/Disney thought it would be appropriate to make political propaganda a centerpiece of this film.  It even goes as far as taking numerous jabs at ""Big Oil"" as referred to in the film - kind of ironic for a sequel spawned by an original movie starring a gas-powered racecar.  I thought Pixar had a principal never to include politics in their films?  They clearly violated that with this film.  Not to mention that Mater - the annoying broken down tow-truck - is clearly the star of this movie, instead of Lightning McQueen - adding to the monotony.

So, a combination of a boring plot plus heavy-handed political drivel makes Cars 2 a loser.  Stick with the original, which has a far superior story and is far less preachy!",1316390400,11,958,4.660714285714286

The premise alone worried me quite a bit.  A movie about simple life values given a sequel as a spy movie?  It doesn't work as a James Bond parody.  It doesn't work as a comedy.  It just flat out doesn't work.  Once in the theater was too much.  No way will I be buying it on BR or DVD.

3641370,1,B001HN6922,"If anyone was ever wondering what effect Disney's purchase of Pixar would have, look no further than this lowest-common-denominator offering from one of the most renowned and respected animation studios in American history.

Anytime Disney needs a quick 300 million dollars, they can now crank out another Toy Story or Monsters Inc to pad up the yearly revenues. And don't fool yourself, Disney will wring every inch of money and merchandising out of Pixar's name that it possibly can.

Story used to be king at Pixar, but this vanity picture shows that John Lasseter no longer has people around him to tell him when an idea is just plain bad. Or that nobody thinks John-Lasseter-as-Mater is clever or funny. Or that Joe Ramft was a better story teller than Lasseter will ever be.

Many people will apologize for this picture and claim that it's low quality is acceptable because ""it's a kids movie."" I would respond with ""kids deserve better than this, and so do you."" It's brain mustard like Cars 2 that's kept animation from growing up in America and kept it as - for the most part - cheap, patronizing, low-brow kiddie fare that offers about as much story sophistication and development as a Bazooka Joe comic.

I realize Pixar didn't have a choice here, and their dilution was inevitable once Disney got their filthy paws on the studio, but it's still sad to see them sacrifice 25 years of integrity and quality just to make a few Disney shareholders a little richer.",1315872000,11,1472,4.76078431372549
3641371,3,B001HN6922,"The 4-star rating above composes 3 stars for the story and 5 for the animation - I err on the side of generosity as, of course, Cars 2 is not as bad as the critics said. They didn't particularly like the original Cars, so they were unlikely to welcome a sequel with open arms, especially one with Mater as the main character! But this isn't a straightforward sequel that leaves the spirit of the original intact. I found it surprisingly violent. Other reviewers commented on the torture scene - and that's not the only nasty moment. It definitely should have got the PG rating mysteriously allocated to its predecessor in the UK which was really a U (G). The set pieces are spectacular, but as this film sets off doggedly down the action movie route there is little counterbalancing character development or emotional buy-in that distinguish Pixar at its best. Given that the original file has cult status among under-10 boys, I felt that the plot is quite complex for younger children to grasp, even if they're not bothered by the violence. At least this will make it watchable for a repeat viewing.

Following the success of the ""Mater's Tall Tales"" short films, Mater has obviously emerged as the most popular (or marketable, or John Lasseter's favourite) Cars character, so Pixar decided to make him the central character in Cars 2. Having closed the loop on Radiator Springs in the original film they needed a McGuffin to make ""Mater's Tall Tales the Movie"" work. Unfortunately the vehicle (no pun) chosen is a spy film, a rather dated genre which sends the film off down the violent action path with very limited opportunity for character development (think: when did you last really care about anyone in a James Bond film, even the hero?) It also sidelines the racing theme - surely the unique selling point of a film about anthropomorphic cars - along with most of the strong characters from the first film. Even Lightning McQueen plays second fiddle to Mater in Cars 2.

The original Cars was criticised, unfairly, for its long slow middle section. But, this did give time for character development so sorely lacking here. Cars 2 over compensates by accelerating into rocket speed in the middle after a fast start and not slowing up until the end.

On the positive side the animation is truly amazing (and will be equally amazing in 2D). If only it had a better story to tell! As a digitially animated London whisked past at rocket speed towards the end I felt that a lot of talent - and money (it cost $200 million to make!) had been splurged in making a film that's not the sum of what went into it. I left the cinema dazzled, slightly disappointed but hoping that there will be a successor. Like Shrek the Third, Cars 2 really isn't a bad film, but it has let down its predecessor and needs a final chapter to redeem the franchise. But please, Pixar, don't make Mater's Tall Tales 2!

** Update after rewatching on DVD - In my heart of hearts I can't justify this film being any higher than 3 stars so have downgraded my review rating. There are many fine vignettes and details in this film especially in the Paris sequence (yes, that is Gusteau's Restaurant from Ratatouille renamed as Gastow's) and the plot is much more understandable second time. But the film is misjudged and lacks the warmth of the original Cars: which was a definite 5-star film. The paucity of bonuses on the DVD tells its own story: ""Air Mater"" (a new Mater's Tall Tales - advertising the forthcoming ""Planes"") and the Toy Story toon which accompanied the cinema release. No making-of documentary, studio stories or director's commentary. Plus the biggest give way of the lot: the word ""Classic"" on back of the DVD box. Last time I saw this was on Chicken Little - enough said! Even the technical expertise of the animation screams vanity project. I think Pixar realise that they've produced a 24-carat misfire and this film will sink faster than Finn McMissile when he abandons the oil rig in the opening sequence.",1315785600,3,4003,4.698005698005698

After being teased for 2 years and waiting with baited breath for this must see, when this dog landed (no offense to dogs) it blew up and stunk like a wet one.  How could anybody screw up a franchise this badly?

I agree with some of the warnings -- the crushing or exploding of some ""good guys"" and the lack of character development (I would have liked to know a little more about the other race cars that every toy store is selling in abundance).

I am not adverse to violence, because I grew up with Bugs Bunny and the Warner Brother cartoons. I let me children watch these shows, but the violence is appropriate to what the characters are doing.

They tried to do the same thing in WALL-E with covering adult material. Please keep the social engineering to politics and leave our children alone.

I am really surprised there are so many negative reviews of this movie. I am a huge animation fan, so maybe I am a little easier sell, but my boyfriend who almost never likes animated films laughed the whole time in the theater too.

Plot: McQueen intends to relax with his pals from Cars 1. An Italian car smack-talks McQueen on a call-in show, so Mater calls in from the payphone to defend his friend. This results in McQueen competing in multiple races against the Italian car and multiple others. They are required to use a synthetic fuel in the races, but saboteurs start taking out the cars one by one which calls into question the safety of the synthetic fuel. Meanwhile Mater is mistaken for a secret agent and becomes actively involved in determining who the saboteurs are along with two real agents who think Mater's innocence is just a stupid act.

I have never been a James Bond fan, so obviously you do not have to like James Bond to catch or enjoy the Cars 2 spoof. I think there is a good message in the movie about not underestimating others and their abilities. The climax is very clever, and I certainly did not anticipate who the ""bad guy"" was.

They tell stories they want to tell. Disregard every review here that gives the film one or two stars for it's violence. Is it violent? Barely. Cars do get killed, but it's not some brutal death where a vehicle's being ripped in half or cut open. There are explosions. There's not even the slightest bit of stylized, mechanical gore. I honestly thought the first Cars was more brutal, showing Cars severely damaged by the wreckage. With that said, I loved this film.

3641397,2,B001HN6922,"The original Cars in one of Pixar's more conflicted movies when it comes to a consensus. Some like it a little, some hate it. I thought it was alright, sort of. Unfortunately, Cars 2 succeeds in removing a lot about what made me like the first movie.

Cars 2 shifts the focus from racecar Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) to Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). The two of them head off to the World Grand Prix, only for Mater's carelessness to cause his friend to lose the first race. After being yelled at by the racecar, Mater decides that he should just go back home, only to be mistaken for a deep cover CIA agent by British spy Finn McMissile (Michael Cain). Thus Mater must help to stop a villainous plot and save the Grand Prix racers.

I like Mater, I've always liked Mater, and I got some genuine laughs from Larry the Cable Guy's performance. At first I didn't think they could possibly do anything with the ""they think he's X and he accidentally makes it looks like he's X"" setup, but it actually works and Mater turns out to be a resourceful guy after all. Another stand-out car his Cain's Finn McMissile. Ever wanted to see anthropomorphic cars beat each other up? I didn't think I did either, but the filmmakers found creative and fun ways to make it happen when McMissile squares off against the villains. Unfortunately, a lot of the spy stuff is out of place in a comedy that's only mildly amusing to anyone who isn't a kid. Younger viewers may be uncomfortable when some of the cars die, for instance.

Aside from those two, John Turturro's Italian Formula One car Francesco Bernoulli provides a fun, arrogant rival for McQueen. One of things I liked about the first Cars was all the characters in Radiator Springs, like Doc Hudson, Sarge, Fillmore, Luigi, and the others (except Sally, she's bland). Here, they're shoved aside and barely do anything (and Doc Hudson seems to be...dead?). This leaves us with strait man McQueen dealing with and reacting to whatever Mater does. Mater and McQueen are the only ones in the emotional spotlight, but their relationship doesn't progress, it retreads what's been done before. Racecar yells at tow truck, tow truck pouts, you know how it is. By the end of the movie, Mater and McQueen haven't moved forward, they've only solved a problem they've solved before. Mater's personal conflict about being oneself and realizing he's a nuisance beats you over the head with its message.

At least the visuals are great. Not just technically, but you also get the feeling that you're in a world of vehicles. You get to see cars in planes, cars in theaters, cars in bathrooms, lots of stuff.

If you're an adult, Cars 2 probably won't impress you like most other Pixar films have, aside from the action and a few of the better jokes. I'm not a little kid, but I'm guessing I would like this movie a whole lot more if I was. The better aspects, especially Mater, are enough to save this movie from the brink of abysmal suck, for me anyway. Overall, Cars 2 just isn't that good.",1313884800,3,3018,4.602230483271375

So disappointing, because they were both such fans of Lightening and Mator before.

I don't know if Pixar has ""lost their way"" as some other reviewers have stated.  But after watching this disaster, I think it's a real possibility.

The globe-trotting plot of ""Car 2"" is not something you find very interesting. Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), who has just come back to Radiator Springs from racing, is back on the tracks again, traveling around the world with his pit crew including Mater, but his motive for entering The World Grand Prix, sponsored by one Miles Axelrod (Eddie Izzard), doesn't convince. Why not just stay with Sally and have a good time?

The ineffective 007-like plotline involving two secret agent cars Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) plus Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), who unwittingly gets involved with espionage and conspiracy, does not help. What is worse is, the spy action plot almost takes over the main one, with incessantly chatting Mater who gets annoying, and some toilet humor (literally) that is misguided.

Clearly the filmmakers including director team John Lasseter and Brad Lewis do not know the film's target audience. Some part of the ""Cars 2"" suggest it was made with younger viewers in mind (besides the toilet humor mentioned above, there are silly jokes and slapstick antics including Mater eating wasabi), while the film includes ""deaths"" of characters, which I think is quite unnecessary. Yes, it is not directly shown, but some cars get ""killed"" and even ""tortured.""

Well we're not super-sensitive to that type of thing, our 5 year-old sees stuff much worse and plays video games much worse.  That being said, Cars 2 seems to be aimed at toddler-aged children primarily and the story doesn't betray that aim, I was pretty surprised when a hero-type character was actually tortured and, well...killed.

Sure the emphasis is not on McQueen but let's not be so picky and just enjoy the awesome CGI and great fun!,1312761600,6,374,4.0675675675675675

It doesn't matter if you liked it or not, did the children I asume you took to see it enjoy it? Mine did, he hasn't stopped talking about it and we went on release day! He loved it, if I go to a child's movie with my son, i am not expecting ""gone with the wind"", or to be intellectually challenged, I go so he can enjoy it. Actually, I did too, its meant to be a ""James Bond"" type, lots of chases, explosions, etc. And it delivered in spades.

3641418,1,B001HN6922,"I don't usually write reviews but am taking the time to write this one.  The movie was HORRIBLY violent.  My 5 year old has worshiped Lightning Mcqueen from the moment he saw Cars.  It is NOT an exaggeration to say we have more Mcqueen stuff than Target and Walmart combined.  My 10 year old son saw the first one in the theater and passed his stuff onto my 5 year old.  Needless to say the whole family has been waiting excitedly for this movie for over a year.

Within the first 15 minutes my 5 year old (not usually a cry baby) was crying because cars were dying.  One of his favorite new characters Rod Redline was tortured and then killed.  I tried to say they just blew his engine but my son was not to be fooled and was crying because that was his heart and he couldn't live without a heart!  TOO smart.  We had to leave once the threat of death was imposed on his hero Mcqueen.  The stress of his hero possibly dying made him start to shake.  My older son who thought the action was cool was also horrified at the violence and stated ""Is this really a G movie mom!"".  When we got home I had to remove the Cars 2 poster from my son's room as the 'bad' cars were on it and he couldn't sleep with them there.

I am SO disappointed in Disney/Pixar and emailed them a letter basically mirroring this review.  I hope someone listens and realizes what a horrible disservice was done to such a beloved character.",1312329600,23,1412,4.2164179104477615

I really can't understand that, because I felt like this movie really lived up to legacy put in place by the original Cars, and all other Disney-Pixar movies. The most likely reason for a low rating is because this movie is in very few ways similar to the the original. The first one tugged at the ol' heart strings; it was a very sentimental movie. This one takes a totally different turn, with intense action sequences and a globe trotting race tournament. The plot of the first movie was really simple, the second has many unexpected twists. You have the return of the main characters from the first movie, and a handful of new cars make their debut as well. Voice acting stupendous, which is to be expected from a Pixar movie.

My kids (10 & 7) both loved the movie, with my oldest enjoying some of the more subtle humor.  The story line is much different from the first, with more focus on Mater.  I would compare it to Cars meets James Bond (fun spy theme).  My youngest has said that this is her favorite Cars movie.  While the underlying theme of friendship is still present, it isn't as obvious to the kids (who will likely focus more on the spy component).  Thus, the reason for just 4 stars and not 5.

3641422,3,B001HN6922,"From an adult who watches kid's movies, it was enjoyable. It's an animated action movie. They brought James Bond and Fast and the Furious into the Cars world. It had Pixar's high quality animation and voice acting, but I think they missed their target audience. The first Cars movie was about being loyal to your friends and those who have supported you, doing whats right, and not always thinking about just yourself. Cars 2 lacks this morale center. It's just an action film in Cars clothing. There is a subtle plot line about McQueen being embarrassed by his rustic friend and how he should accept him for who he is, and Mater learning that the world sees him as an idiot and his need to prove his self-worth, (as well as a political commentary about alternative fuels and big oil companies) but these plots are likely missed by young children (and probably many adults).

If you don't care if there is a lesson to be learned, its a great film. Enjoyable for all ages. If you believe that children learn social skills from their entertainment and see their movie heroes as behavioral models, they aren't going to gain much from this movie.",1312070400,6,1142,4.653465346534653
3641423,5,B001HN6922,"... our family LOVED it!  As parents, the days of living for ourselves is long gone.  We now enjoy watching our children find enjoyment... and in this film, both our 8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter found a lot.  Maybe some people have forgotten what it was like to be a child, but this film incorporates all the coolness of action/adventure films, and all the thrills of more grown-up blockbusters, and puts them in a film children can safely watch and enjoy (with their parents who won't be bored out of their mind).  Is it going to win an Oscar?  Probably not.  But, is it something fun that a whole family can do together?  You bet!

I also don't understand why people are complaining about the ""violence"" in the film.  We're extremely sensitive to truly violent content, and nothing in this film comes close to content in films like The Incredibles (also by Pixar), Monsters vs. Aliens, Mega-mind, etc.  If this stuff bother's you... then stick to Strawberry Shortcake, and the like.

And, needless to say, Pixar has set the bar incredibly high for future filmmakers to reach, including themselves.  So, perhaps this one doesn't top Finding Nemo or Toy Story 3... (very few films ever will).  But, this film is still far and above the majority of animated fare out there from other studios.

You know, I'm all for pushing the art and craft of movie making.  But, not all films are meant to attain classic status, but are instead created to simply be fun and to entertain.  This one does that in spades!  So, ignore the critics, round up the family, and just enjoy a fun movie together.

NOTE ABOUT 3D CONTENT:

We saw this in its 3D presentation in theaters (which will most likely be the same, or very similar, transfer for blu-ray).  Like most Pixar 3D offerings, the 3D is understated and its emphasis is on adding realism and providing an immersive experience, rather than shock value.  Don't expect too much WOW factor... but instead, expect a fully fleshed out world that you will feel a part of.  (Much more desirable in my opinion.)  We plan on buying the 3D version because it really did make a fun story even more fun.  Enjoy!",1311984000,7,2147,4.648936170212766
3641424,3,B001HN6922,"When one thinks about Pixar, the term failure is typically no part of the equation and indeed what the powerhouse pixel-pushing studio might consider a disappointment would have its hordes of imitators doing cartwheels in the streets.  Keeping that in mind, Cars 2 could very well be the first Pixar film to put such theories to the test.

Generally speaking the first Cars never fully overcame criticisms that individuals outside of car culture (a group that naturally includes the children for whom the film targeted) were oblivious to much of the film's charm.  In that line of thinking, the sequel further isolates itself from mainstream animation audiences by continuing the tradition of references only a mechanic could fully appreciate but this time combining them with the international spy/ thriller genre.

This fact is no coincidence as the script was written by Ben Queen (the creator of Fox TV's ""Drive"") from an outline dreamed up by John Lasseter and Brad Lewis.  The scope of this one is immediately much larger; ditching the backwater-feel of Radiator Springs for International flavor and manages to poke fun of a whole lot of cultural stereotypes in the process.

The plot actually breaks down into two parallel story-threads, a spy drama and auto racing action.  The spy portion, believe it or not, centers on Tow Mater (again played flawlessly by Larry the Cable Guy) and involves the simple-minded tow truck's clueless meandering leading to all sorts of secret agent misunderstandings.  In the mean time our hero Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) agrees to partake in a grueling championship, The World Grand Prix, in effort to silence boisterous Italian Formula One car Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro).

Like all Pixar efforts, there is some brilliance scattered throughout but it's highly unlikely the intended audience is going to pick up on much of it.  For starters some of the spy angles reference spy films from the 1960s (spoofed to death by the likes of Mike Myers and the Austin Powers Franchise).  Adults old enough to recognize such bits will likely get a chuckle but expect these nuances to go largely unnoticed by the kids.  Additionally, some of the better dialog exchanges once again involve internal combustion engine references that, although accurate and quite clever to boot, will likely be lost upon the hordes of soccer moms forced to watch to placate the children.

Interestingly, the character roles have reversed this time around with Mater getting the lion's share of the screen-time and McQueen serving as supporting cast.  For fans of Mater (a group that includes your author), this is a good thing.  However, proponents of the rusty truck may find themselves cringing at the overexposure and oftentimes annoying behavior.  McQueen actually becomes a bit more difficult to like as a result of this setup as he's really presented as more someone who endures Mater's presence rather than enjoys his friendship.

 A few new characters are entered into the fold (aside from the aforementioned Italian F-1 car) including Finn McMissile; a British agent voiced by Michael Caine, Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) as Mater's love interest and a new villain by the name of Professor Zndapp (Thomas Kretschmann).

While Disney is typically cautious not to integrate political views into their pieces, there is a bit of fossil fuel reliance danger/ Big Oil propaganda to be found here.  Of course it could be argued that these are simply current global issues and hence integrated as a sign of the times.

The visuals are charming as ever with massive explosions, water effects, rich textures and so on.  Sounds are spectacular, on down to accurate engine roars amidst a pack of wide-open competition automobiles.  Pixar's attention to detail is as impressive as ever and as expected, Michael Giacchino's score is executed so perfectly as to be subliminal.

In all Cars 2 will likely manage to hold the attention of its intended audience as kids will clamor at the intense onscreen action and the sheer satisfaction of seeing their favorite personified automobiles in action again.  Fans of the first film will likely find more to appreciate including a global setting and anything but a rehash of the same plotline but it's safe to say those moviegoers who were never quite enamored with the first film's niche-laced charms should probably avoid looking to the sequel to change their opinion.",1311984000,5,4434,5.10803324099723

In my personal Pixar ranking ""Cars"" is only second to the Toy Story trilogy despite critics ranking it at the bottom, it's such a heartwarming story with excellent caracter development and beautifull ending. The formula in Pixar has been always the same, they create memorable and appealing caracters and give them excellent stories that are enjoyable for both kids and grownups. That is exactly what made Pixar so special and different to other studios that heavily relay on eyecatching visual effects and place story writing in second or third place. Ask any kid what are the names for the creatures in ""Monsters vs Aliens"" or the alien kid in ""Planet 51"" and they will stare at you with no answer, then ask that same kid the name of the evil emperor in ""Toy Story"" or Lightning McQueens carrier truck in ""Cars"" and almost for shure they will tell you they're names. Unfortunately ""Cars 2"" seems to be created to exploit some of Pixar's most beloved caracters more than continuing what they achieved in the first film and created a vast number of new caracters to exploit them with merchandising (just take a look at Wal Mart). Success was already secured in the US, but all that thing about that silly international race was -i think- to appeal to the foreign box office. The movie is full of cliches and silly situations immposible to be believed (in the context) even by a kid. I am so disappointed with this movie that i wish ""Cars 2"" could be remaid and retake the story where it left in ""Cars"", sadly this movie gave a ""no return"" turn to the original story and a ""Cars 3"" movie will not be able to undue the dammage.
Now i have to decide if i am going to purchase the ""Cars 2"" Bluray only to keep my Pixar collection complete or skip as a way to protest and put a superteeny pressure on Pixar to return to they're roots and do what they do best, and that is giving a real story not just visuals.",1311811200,12,2089,4.428571428571429

Let it be known that I never saw the first Cars because it never really appealed to me, but Pixar has never let me down before so I went into Cars 2 with an open mind. Unfortunately I was let down by this film.

To me, the film was boring, felt too long, the main character(Mator) was terrible, and did not have a topic that the children (most likely Pixar's target audience) would not relate to in any way. I can understand how Mator may have been a good supporting character in the first film, but the whole dumb, airhead character is never a good main character. The film being about cars and their oil is not something that children would know anything about. The group of kids I was with did not really understand what was going on with the whole changing of oil plot and even though I understood the plot, it is not something that I would want to sit and watch a movie on.

To be honest, after seeing this film I have no interest in ever seeing the first film or watching this one again. This series may be financially successful for Pixar, but one thing that I always loved about Pixar is that even though they produce animated children's film, their films can be enjoyed by all. It seems as though they put so much work into their films to create some of the best animated films around that everyone can enjoy. Pixar has disappointed me with Cars 2. Cars 2 is without a doubt the worst Pixar film I have ever seen, and it seems as though the critics agree with that. I would not suggest Cars 2 to anyone, whether it be someone my age, a chid, or anyone else for that matter.

However, when he sees that the world grand pri is coming round, and one of it's racers, is mocking him, Mater (Larry the cable guy) convices him to enter the grand pri.
They head to japan, where Mater runs into super spy, Finn McMissile, who thinks Mater is an American spy he wishes to meet with. Him and his partner, Holly shiftwell, take mater on to help them stop the evil Professer Zundapp from using a new alternative fuel to..well you know.

The first question you might want answer is ""Is it as bad as critics say?"". Well, my answer is...No. Not at all! Infact... i loved it!

Let me first say the one problem i had, which didn't really bug me that much, but it's still enough to take some points off

Like some people have said, it doesn't have the heart all the pixar movies have. There's only one scene of real emotion, and it feels slapped on. But it doesn't really take away from how fun it is.

I think what really makes it good, is the spy element. Some people say it's out of place, but i didn't care, it was still pretty cool. Finn is a great character, while not too complex, he is just awesome. This is due to a great performance by Micheal Caine. He just sounds great, and it seems like he had fun with this movie. Everyone does in fact

Now for the other common complaint: Mater. He's the main character this time around, which bugs people. Personally, i didn't mind it. I love mater, and he's big role in it is fine for me. He plays off well against Finn and Holly,. Mater is also just plain awesome. He ends up figuring out the bad guys plan in a very cool way, and he is bad ass with his new spy status

Yes, McQueen isn't in it much, but he is in it. I would of like to see more of him, and as a spy, but it's ok he's not in it much. For those wondering, A113 is on Mater's license plate. Also on the tail of the spy plane Siddeley. Additionally, the number appears beneath the photo of Axlerod's engine when Finn, Holley, and Mater are examining it for the first time.

Infact, this has the most A113's in a pixar movie. Pretty cool, eh?

The score is pretty cool too. Though it's not the best. The main theme is really good i must say. This is done by the same cuy who composed The Incredibles and Up, just so you know.

As for what i think of the negative reviews..eh i don't care anymore. So pixar made a negatively reviewed movie. So what? Everyone makes mistakes once in awhile. Though i do think some of the reviewers are asking too much from this movie.

To sum it up, Cars 2 is not the smartest pixar movie, but it's still an incredibly fun ride and i will be watching it for years to come.

Score: 8.9/10

3641448,2,B001HN6922,"What this movie had in action it lacked in heart.
This is the first time I have ever been disappointed by a Pixar film.
I tend to write to what emotions were evoked or what about the film I enjoyed rather than plot points so I will primarily stick to the same here with some interjections regarding theme.
This was mostly a ""spy"" movie.  Great animation, excellent voice acting all of the technical wonders that Pixar can bring to the screen.
The plot was decent, but a little advanced for most kids 8 or under.
Guns...lots of guns.  Yeah, I know that they are not people, but kids get the inference.  ""Things"" get shot, in that they are animated and infused with persona, ""things"" die.  Not suitable for a G-rated film.  Not suitable for my child.
Lastly and most important-where was the heart and soul present in all other Pixar films?!  There was kind of a broad message about staying true to yourself and your friends, but this was tucked away with jokes from Mater (Larry the Cable guy) and an almost absent Lightning McQueen who is not the protagonist of this film.
I came away heartbroken.  My just seven-year old son said it best; when asked which one he liked best ""Cars"" or ""Cars 2"" he noted ""Cars 2"" because it had so much more action.  Of course he did.  He does not usually get to see guns blazing or perpetual motion in his movies.

From the moment it starts, it becomes evident the movie is a parody of a James Bond film, so people who do not like 007 will probably not like this one either. The way the plot is presented (conspiracy by one individual to discredit ethanol so that oil sales prevail), I do not believe it should be taken seriously, but it probably still is a reflection of what goes on in real life, something which, of course, anyone younger than 14 will most likely have a hard time comprehending.

The animation of the cities is amazing (just as is the animation of Rio de Janeiro in the movie Rio): Tokyo, London, and a fantasy city, Porto Corsa, which is a mixture of both Monte Carlo and the Amalfi Coast, are impressive, especially for those who have had the opportunity to visit the real places.

The characters' names are hilarious and there is a story behind almost all of them; the catch is that one needs to know a bit about car racing and other things to get these ""inside jokes"". For instance, Francesco Bernoulli's name is a reference to Daniel Bernoulli, a scientist who worked on fluid dynamics and conservation of energy theories. The yellow pick-up, John Lassetire, is an obvious reference to the movie's director, John Lasseter. Those who speak French will know that the family name of the French car, Raoul CaRoule, means ""it rolls"" (both in the sense that it moves on wheels, and that it goes fine). Another one of the cars, not a racing one though, is Prince ""Wheeliam"", an obvious reference. Fernando Alonso, one of the Spanish cars, borrows its name from a well-known Spanish Formula 1 racer, just like the Mexican car, Memo Rojas, which only appears in the version made for Latin America (by the way, the movie has six versions, for different regions of the world, with slight variations in the characters to fit each of them). Carla Veloso, the Brazilian and only female car, reminds us of a samba school dancer. The accents that accompany each of the cars match their personalities to a tee, and are equally as funny. And there are probably many more of these ""resemblances"" to real life that I missed.

So this movie has different ""levels"", interesting for people of different ages, which is kind of unusual for a kids' movie. I would probably not want to see Toy Story twice, but I would indeed enjoy watching Cars 2 a couple times more, for fun, and to catch what I missed the first time. I believe Pixar is doing an amazing job in this aspect. The reason why some people did not like the movie is probably either because they do not like James Bond style movies or because they were not able to see beyond the plot and the violence. I would even say that the movie might be more interesting for adults than for children, but that would be its only default.",1311033600,6,2946,4.51123595505618
3641453,1,B001HN6922,"Highly disappointed in this much anticipated movie.  My daughter has been enamoured with CARS since she was two years old.  She had a CARS themed party for her third birthday.  She had CARS shoes, clothing, toys.  It was only logical that her first trip to the movie theater should be for CARS2.  For a year we had been looking forward to this trip and the release of the movie.  Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed.  This movie is very different from the first.  It is very violent - lot s of shooting - and the story line is too complex for the 3-6 year old crowd.  The story line is centered around a truck that used to own an oil company, he ran out of gas in the wilderness, sold his company and decided to produce a bio-fuel.  He had a world wide race with the cars only using this new fuel.  The the ""bad cars"" start to blow up the race cars with a lazer that makes the fuel explode.  *Spoiler alert* - turns out, the truck that produces the bio-fuel owns the larges underwater oil field in the world and is trying to convince everyone to give up looking for a suitable bio-fuel and switch back to gas.  What?  How is a four year old supposed to understand this?  I have NO IDEA how it got a G rating, as How To Train Your Dragon is less violent than this movie, in my opinion, and that is PG.  After the first ten minutes, my daughter was in my lap crying that she wanted to go home!!!",1311033600,61,1403,4.198501872659176

I just saw Cars 2 about a few hours ago, and this amazing movie has taken my breath away and stolen my heart. Oh, where do I start? How about that story! It's the craziest idea I've ever heard of and would've never imagined that the long-anticipated sequel to the equally amazing Cars would be a spy thriller! But it's a good kind of crazy, you know? It's hillarious, touching, and edge-of-your seat awesome, more so than the usual animated movie. One thing I loved about this one was that they let Mater take the spotlight for this. He plays a larger role, much more than the sweet, loveable sidekick (not that he still isn't) he was in the first one. He even gets a chance to prove that he's actually got brains under that hood of his (even though he doesn't have one... LOL). The action was amazing, the suspense made me grip the edge of my seat, the humor kept me laughing 'til I cried, and it was filled to the brim with surprises. Let me tell you this: Pixar is an amazing company, they are some of the most talented storytellers in the universe and haven't yet disappointed me with their amazing films, and they probably never will! This film is insanely amazing and takes you places you could've never imagined. If you loved the first and the shorts, you'll love Cars 2. KA-CHOW!",1310947200,4,1349,4.487804878048781
3641455,3,B001HN6922,"Having to explain to my 4-year old Cars-aholic daughter why bad guy cars were out to ""kill"" other cars in Cars 2 was a little unsettling and unexpected.  I was very surprised by the amount of automobile ""deaths"" and threat of ""deaths"" in the film.  Cars were always out to get other cars.  The spy genre was just not right for a Cars themed movie.  My daughter LOVES the firetruck character Red, but he only appeared, what?  A total of 2 minutes?  I felt so bad for her.  All those familiar and loved characters from the first film were castaways in Cars 2.

With that all said, we still enjoyed the movie.  Finn McMissile became her newest favorite Car.  She even calls him Finn McMiss-Sile, as Michael Caine pronounces it.  We will still buy the BluRay and enjoy it at home.",1310947200,61,776,4.432624113475177

When the Incredibles ended, it ended on a cliffhanger.

I thought there was no way that they could make it as good as the original and I wasn't sure how they would pull it off.  If you expect it to be just like Cars and have all of the same characters, of course you will be disappointed.  I think that this movie was a great sequel.  They had plenty of action and plenty of Mater's antics.  Most of the original characters have small parts, but Lightning McQueen, Mater, Luigi, Guido, Sarge and Fillmore are in it throughout the movie.  I don't want to say much about it because I wouldn't want to ruin it for others, but I absolutely loved the plot and all of the new characters that were introduced in this one.  There was plenty of action, adventure and fun.  I think that the reason some people don't like it is because it isn't what they expected.  Honestly, I didn't know what to expect either, but Pixar exceeded my expectations, once again!  I think this is a great addition to the Pixar family and I highly recommend it to everyone.",1310860800,2,1056,4.314720812182741
3641458,2,B001HN6922,"I'm not even a kid, but I was looking forward to a follow up to this Pixar classic. From the beginning of the movie, it is a very different tone overall compared to what the first movie was about. In the first movie, it had a lot of great values, a lot of heart and soul all while being an entertaining ride. In this one, it's all about action and corny jokes, creating a very different tone compared to the last movie.

It starts off introducing a James Bond like atmosphere where the spy car, voiced by Michael Cain gets busted spying on a group of ""bad-guys"" and an action filled chase follows with thrills and explosions; then the plot of the film kicks in where a guy, or I should say, a car, invents some new fuel source and creates a race challenge where he invites all of the different styles of racing champions from around the world to compete in it, all while the spys and bad-guys are up to something behind the scenes.

This movie features Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), but more of the focus seems to be around Mator (Larry The Cable Guy) who returns as a bumbling goof and gets himself mixed up in some spy business.

I won't ruin the plot, so I will leave it at that, but I will guarantee you, you are not going to find someone who can honestly say this movie is better, as good, or comes close to being as good as the first one. Why? It's just so different to the first, it has no heart, no soul, no morel and just relies on a few sight gags rather then make you feel you just saw something special, instead you just feel like they crammed together any old thing for a quick buck.

Don't get me wrong, it's not a TERRIBLE movie, but I would recommend hiring or d/l it. to purchase a copy, I know I would feel ripped off that I just bought a 20 to 30 buck coffee coaster I will never have a use for after seeing it once.",1310860800,8,1838,4.154494382022472

My kids were even sorry we'd spent the money on the big screen, and they do not want the dvd at home - which says a lot!  If you just have to see it, don't pay more than $1.00 at Redbox.  ....

3641462,4,B001HN6922,"I had a very unusual experience seeing this movie in theaters.

I watched it, I had a great time, I laughed, cheered, was thrilled, and the moment the credits started to roll the people in the row behind me IMMEDIATELY started spouting off how much they HATED it. I was flabbergasted. I was sorely tempted to turn around and ask them if we even just saw the same movie? How could anyone hate something that's so much FUN?!

But after thinking about it, I could see actually why they didn't get into it. Cars 2 is the first Pixar movie where you really have to 'get the joke' of the premise, or the whole thing falls apart like a house of cards. What this movie is, is the best James Bond movie of the last 15 years (not counting Casino Royale which transcends Bond movies to be just a great spy movie), with a bit of The Accidental Spy thrown in.

I LOVE Bond movies. The crazy opening sequences, the insane gadgets, the quippy lines. And Cars 2 hit pitch perfect parodies of every Bond standard. But you could never say of any Bond movie that it's got a deep emotional core, that's not how they're made. They're made to be balls to the wall fun and thrills, and that's what this movie is. Which of course makes it the polar opposite of the original Cars. It could hardly be more different.

If you get the joke, that this is a James Bond movie with cars, it's a riot. Loads of fun. It's not deep, it's not going to tug at your heart strings, it will not make your mother cry three or four times (as virtually ever Pixar movie ever made prior has done to my mother, I take her to Pixar movies with a bucket). It's just riotous fun. And I'm amazed that people are punishing Pixar for making a movie that's just pure fun. Granted Pixar is famous for it's deep emotional stories, and I suppose people expect that sort of thing every time. Even if you make a fun and entertaining movie, if you don't do what people expect, they bite your head off for it.

I went in with few expectations cause the early reviews bashed it to pieces, and I was frankly not that big a fan of the original movie. In the first Cars McQueen spends an enormous amount of the movie whining, and I found him generally unlikeable until fully halfway through the movie. It was a good movie, with a lot of heart and a message, but not one I would describe as a lot of FUN. Mater especially, a little of him went a long way in the first movie, and I was really worried about him being the star of this movie, because if a little of him annoyed me in the first movie, this one has 10 times more of him.

And yet, he actually annoyed me LESS this time around, cause he had something to do instead of just hanging around being Mater. They struck a perfect balance in his 'mater-ness' where the Accidental Spy nature of his story is charming instead of just annoying. And even more to my amazement, Mater's unique perspective DOES actually help solve the mystery. He's not just a bumbling idiot gumming up the works, he does actually help.

I was also constantly amused at the imagination that went into Cars-ifying the world. Even little touches like the swanky party in Towkyo (not a typo! ha!), the elevators are giant pistons that come out of the floor. I didn't expect it at all but once I saw it was it was so perfect.

To sum up, I have to say, I enjoyed this movie MORE than the original Cars. Yet at the same time I'll fully agree that the original is a technically superior film in writing and character, but Cars 2 is way more fun. If you go into this with the right attitude, that you're seeing a James Bond movie with Cars, that it's meant to be pure fun and embrace it on that level, there's a lot to love.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it IS shallow. I won't say it's a perfect film on every level cause it's not. But it doesn't deserve the hate it's getting, it's just a fun movie, and there's nothing wrong with that. If it doesn't quite transcend to the levels of brilliance of The Incredibles or Wall:E, that doesn't make it BAD, it suffers only in comparison to other Pixar work, compared to anything else, it rocks. :)",1310688000,408,4117,4.261203585147247
3641463,1,B001HN6922,"Last year, Pixar hit gold with Toy Story 3, which may be their crowning moment of glory. One particularly raved about scene (and understandably why) showed the toys being thrust face first into an inferno, trying their hardest to escape, but ultimately holding hands and coming to the realization that they are going to die. That scene became the most talked about scene in 2010's lists of summer blockbusters, on par with the brilliant fight scene in Inception where Arthur fights a man in a hotel hallway with shifting gravity.

Because of that, Pixar thought it would be cool to thrust High Octane Nightmare Fuel in their next (supposed) family oriented movie, including a rather gnarly fight between cars in a lube station, cars being destroyed with a laser type machine with the fuel in them, cars being tied up and begging for their lives, a pair of cars being tied to the gears of Big Ben and many others.

Aside from that general bit of unpleasantness in this bafflingly G rated movie, nothing happens.

No, seriously, nothing happens. Mater essentially drives around blabbering. On sense for essentially 75% of the movie. There is some bullcrap about Mater and an Italian race car and something about British intelligence. But the problem is, both of those sub stories go NOWHERE.

One should sincerely hope that Pixar was simply trolling us with even the idea of a Cars 2. Cars had a very mixed reacton from Pixar's overall fan base. It got the lowest rating prior to this movie on Rotten Tomatoes with 74%. And it's box office numbers were just barely average, even by Pixar standards. So with low expectations in place, one could expect a disappointment, and that said, that person is correct.

Just avoid this movie. Pixar, hang your heads in shame.",1310428800,11,1762,4.801980198019802
3641464,3,B001HN6922,"I'm the mother of a four-year-old boy who has seen ""Cars"" roughly 2.7 billion times in the past two years he's been watching movies. It was, and is, his favorite film, and even I don't mind hearing it on the endless loop it seems to be on in our minivan DVD player. My son was DYING to see ""Cars 2,"" in the theater, ""with the glasses,"" and we went this past weekend. (He even knew the opening date from the ubiquitous TV ads and preview trailers on various DVDs and has been talking about this for MONTHS.)

To sum up his review: he wanted to leave halfway through to, ""go home and play Legos."" This was his second-ever in-theater movie; first, ""Tangled,"" when he was only three, he loved and had no problem sitting through, even with the 3D glasses on.

The ""Toy Story: Hawaiian Vacation"" short at the beginning was brilliant. Really shows they could do a ""Toy Story 4,"" which I guess Tom Hanks recently hinted at, but please spare us a ""Cars 3.""

This was a shoot-'em-up spy movie which MAY have worked with another conceit but had nothing to do with the established Cars universe, so why do a second film? The races were secondary (almost pointless), the entire message of friendship and slow-down-and-enjoy-life from the first film was COMPLETELY thrown out the window, and a little of Tow Mater goes a LONG way. Unless you're a rabid Larry the Cable Guy fan, this is an easy wait for the DVD. And if you're child-free, this is a Pixar film you're gonna want to pass on.

I agree with the critics: This is Pixar's first failure. (That Oscar streak has definitely come to an end.) Not the worst kids' movie I've ever seen, but I expected far better from Disney and, especially, Pixar. The plot was pointless and silly (and I grew up a rampant James Bond fan), the dialogue lacked the clever repartee of previous Pixar pictures (what usually keeps the adults watching) and it just wasn't very fun at all. Expertly animated, of course, with plenty of ""cool"" chases and spy gadgets ... But that's not nearly enough to carry a movie.",1309996800,61,2032,4.513586956521739

The plot? A bunch of lemons take ownership of a secret oil reserves in the ocean--and they want revenge on the ""pretty"" cars that never break down.

It's a weak premise, and lacks the heart of the original Cars (which stemmed from John Lasseter's very personal ""aha"" moment involving a road trip and the realization of the importance of friends and family).

I didn't care about any of the new characters in Cars 2, which are basically James Bond-type spies. Sure, there's some amusing moments and brief visits with the original cast members (Lizzie, Sarge, Red, Fillmore, etc.), but they are VERY small portions of the movie.

There is TONS of action in Cars 2--too much, really. It made me dizzy. Lots of gunfire and explosions, making me VERY surprised that it's rated G (it should have been PG). It felt like a movie made for young boys...and the Dads that would take them to see it.

My son enjoyed it, but he loves all Pixar movies. My husband and I weren't very impressed with this one. Even the ""short"" at the begining (a Toy Story short I can't even remember) was...well, forgettable.

If you like car chases, spy stuff and tons of explosions, you may like this movie. If you're expecting the relaxed pace and heart of the first Cars, you'll likely be very disappointed. It feels like a Fourth of July shoot-em-up blockbuster--and it would appear that was exactly the intent of the filmmakers.

You're better off waiting for Cars 2 to come out on DVD as a renter, rather than spend the $ seeing in the theaters or buying the DVD without first viewing Cars 2.

Americans bad.  Big oil bad.

The irony is that all these adorable cars are trying to get rid of the fuel they were designed to run on because they'd rather run on ""alternative fuels"" that don't exist yet, much like so many Americans want to run away from their own greatness for some utopia wonder-world that exists in their imagination.

Oh, and since this movie has dredged the 1970's for some of the most awful cars, how about some exploding Ford Pintos?  I would have added another star if I'd seen some of those.  At least try to see it once before you pay cash for a clunker.

Edit 11/20/2011
Got to see the movie again without spending any money.  In the 23rd minute of the movie it is explained that the Americans ""discovered"" this ""biggest oil reserve in the world"".  What the Americans discovered was the platforms already existing and being controlled by evil lemon cars.  So, the drilling platforms were not themselves owned by Americans.  An American agent was working with the brit spies.  So, I missed that and I'll admit that I was wrong.

I changed the title of my review to remove ""anti-American"", but I still think the whole thing is a preachy propaganda piece that I have no desire ever to see again.",1309824000,13,1604,4.682142857142857

Such scenes would be a thrill if your expecting the Bourne Identity, but the mix of genres is just a mess.  I miss the character development from the first movie. Gone is the grand supporting cast of Red, Ramone, Sally, Sheriff, Philmore and Sarge who are relegated to short cameo appearances.

From the reviews I read here, seems a lot of people expected more, or better. I see it different. I watched it with the family, and we all loved it. It might not be the greatest or best animation out there, but we thought it was really good. It did not disappoint (not to us).

I wasn't sure what to expect of it. I always liked movies by Pixar. To me, from the 1st, with Toy Story, Pixar just set a complete new bar for animation movies. I was long awaiting Cars2 to come out, but I was wondering how they could make a sequel on Cars a hit. In my mind, it must be so hard, to come up with another good storyline, with the same characters. So I was cautious going to watch this movie, expecting it to just not be as good as the first Cars was.

Wonder, wonder, they pulled it off again! It was really good, with lots of action (well, .. at least we liked it). It is a very fast, action packed movie, which I have to admit, got me by surprise. I certainly wasn't expecting that, but then again,... I hadn't seen the trailers either. But more important, the whole family loved the movie. Especially our 6 yol son. I think he's just at the right age to enjoy this movie. Any younger, and I think he would not have enjoyed it as much. Simply, because I think it would have been too fast, and too action packed for him at a younger age. I'm guessing the writers were thinking CARS x JAMES BOND x FAST AND FURIOS. I thought it turned out pretty cool!

Perhaps I liked it because I did not know what to expect from it,... and just sat back, relaxed, and enjoyed the movie with family,... At no point did I get the need of (deeply) analyzing the movie, story, characters, etc.... it was entertaining enough to me/us.",1309824000,16,1722,4.165165165165165

But Cars 2 is... garbage.  Complete and utter garbage.

The plot, such as it is, could have been written by a computer.  Other reviewers cover it well, and I agree with the points that the plot was derivative, simplistic, and utterly predictable.  The morals taught in the film were so pedantic, so... trivial, that they seem as an afterthought to the endless series of explosions, frenetic and spastic action, and even poor voice acting.

Man, this film was awful.  This should have been a straight-to-DVD Target stocking stuffer, instead Cars 2 is now the cinematic abortion that will be remembered as the low point where Pixar remembered that story is important, not just animation.

Given the near inevitability of sequel slump, my hopes for Cars 2 were only a little higher than what I expected of the theater's popcorn.

Boy, was I wrong. The car in-jokes were better, the plot had more to keep me paying attention, and pitting the James Bond crowd against the Bondo set worked brilliantly. Jokes about lemon cars mingled easily with an eco-message, as the two major plots (racing & spy stuff) advanced individually and jointly. The fact that Mater took the lead this time only added to the charm. It's not always the smartest or strongest who saves the day. Whatever you do well will matter some day, and just a little bravery can stop cold anyone with none at all.

Beautifully made and kid-safe, this one blows the doors off its predecessor. Oh, and the ""Hawaiian Vacation"" short rose to Pixar's stratospheric standards for short films.

3641485,5,B001HN6922,"My 2 year old LOVES the original Cars movie.  He wakes up talking about ""Queen"" and goes to bed talking about ""Mater"".  With 4 children, it's extremely difficult to find a movie that the entire family can enjoy.  We just watched Cars2 at the movie theater.  My 2 year old never moved throughout the movie and my 16 year old son laughed the entire time.  It was a great!  Everyone knows that Mater made the original movie so funny, that's why he is the main character in part 2.  He does not let you down!  My husband, all 4 children and myself all agree that this beats the original movie.  Way to go Pixar!",1309564800,3,607,4.254385964912281
3641486,3,B001HN6922,"Being a Pixar film is a double edged sword. While simply being a Pixar film, the chances are you are going to be vastly superior to any other animated film out there.  However, just being ""as good"" or ""better"" than any other animated film out there is really performing below average if you are a Pixar film.

The first Cars film is probably one of my least favorite Pixar films. So when I saw they were making a second one, my mind made a resounding ""Meh"". Then when I saw that Cars 2 was getting pretty awful reviews, I went in the theater with my son with very low expectations.

The story basically revolves around two sub stories. The first is Lightning McQueen taking part in an international race promoting alternative, eco-friendly fuel.  The second is Mater getting mistaken for a spy and being drug into an international investigation with two other British spies, looking for who is behind an evil plan. If you are a fan of Mater then you will probably really enjoy this film because he really is the star. Lightning McQueen kind of takes a back seat.

The film was very funny and kept us laughing through the majority of it but you could tell there really wasn't any ""shine"" to this one that we have grown accustomed to with Pixar. Toy Story 3 had it's impact gut wrenching moment, UP had it's heart felt moment and was an amazing film after the first 5 minutes, Wall-E was stock full of charm and laughter, while Cars 2 really didn't have any moments that really struck you to the core.

In the end, as a stand alone film Cars 2 is a pretty good animated film. However, when you stack it up against other Pixar movies and keep in mind that we are used to having something that knocks our socks off year after year, this film really is just sub-par.",1309392000,11,1761,4.419753086419753

8309115,1,B001HN6922,"Shockingly bad children's movie. The storyline was complicated and hard to follow for young children. My son (who is OBSESSED with Cars) kept asking us to fast forward to good parts because he was bored by the drawn-out adult-themed scenes. That was a blessing in disguise though, because he never paid close enough attention to the fact that cars were being hunted, tortured, killed, and repeatedly shot at with machine guns. WT-actual-F, Pixar?? Definitely should not have been a G-rated movie.

Normally I screen movies before my kid watches them, but I took for granted that the fun-loving and sweet bunch from Radiator Springs would make another classic. I was wrong.",1524441600,,672,5.054054054054054
