8075677,3,B000A7IHOE,"I bought this subtitled DVD of Mlada some years ago, I am not sure whether it was from Amazon or another source, to replace a VHS tape version I managed to buy some years earlier.
The opera/ballet is a musically delightful work but is a challenge to stage.  The Bolshoi makes a respectable attempt to stage it, recorded on the earlier version issued on VHS.  The later version issued on DVD, while having the plus of subtitles, is essentially the same production but performance standards are degraded from the VHS version, in particular the dancing is lack lustre in the Night on Bald Mountain scene.
A further irritant is the introduction of pointless interruptions from a ""comic?"" character seated in a box.
Either video version is worth having for the fascinating musical score and some visualisation is better than reading the libretto and stage directions.  The challenge of having several white and black horses on stage for the divination scene is neatly solved with dancers portraying the horses.  The fertility rite where dolls are to be thrown into the lake but the lake rises and drowns everyone is well symbolised.
The opening scenes, where leading characters are triply portrayed by singers, dancers and massive dolls is somewhat confusing.  The scene where Cleopatra is raised from the dead in an attempt to seduce the hero is spectacular.
If interested I suggest start by sampling the audio recordings of the full work, possibly with a libretto or detailed scenario, available from Amazon.  I have down graded the stars reflecting the shoddy performance in the later subtitled DVD compared to the earlier VHS version.
May be someday a better stage production will emerge of this Russian challenge to Wagner's Ring cycle.",1456531200,,1736,5.010416666666667
8075678,2,B000A7IHOE,"I can't really say I didn't like it, as I wasn't even able to watch it. The product description says NTSC, but it isn't.  I received it and put it on to play and the message Not NTSC came up across my television screen.  I looked at the back of the DVD case and it said PAL.  The retailer I purchased it through was very nice about refunding me my money, BUT Amazon's product description needs to be more accurate.  I noticed that several of the retailers actually state that it is PAL format, but others don't.  I have seen the production and, other than a few changes in the supporting cast, it's the same as the older version that is available in NTSC.  However, this version is superior in that whoever filmed it shows full shots of the dancers, not just from the shoulders up.",1445212800,,781,4.315068493150685
