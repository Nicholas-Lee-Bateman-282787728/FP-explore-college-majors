My wife is from northern Sulawesi and we had often talked of visiting Tangkoko reserve. As a result of viewing this DVD, my wife and I hired one of the guides who has worked on some of the monkey projects. In what turned out to be one of the most enjoyable days of my life, we joined this group of monkeys for a morning and it was really something! They are just as this film depicts; generally very gentle and not bothered by the presence of a few people. The love that the filmmaker has for these adorable critters is really fun to watch. And the message that he and his helper are trying to get out; that is, ""please stop eating these guys - there are plenty of other things to eat!"", is really, really necessary! Watch this film, and you will be hooked! You, too, will want to visit them and save them!",1502582400,,910,4.296511627906977

Learned a lot.",1486598400,,123,4.636363636363637

8624743,3,B00GMM19NW,"This was a very well-made documentary.  The film-maker's agenda was to draw attention to the plight of black-crested macaques, appealing not only to the international community but also to the people who live in the communities near their habitat.  Warning: there are people who like to eat the monkeys and this film has graphic scenes in the meat markets.",1463097600,4,356,5.016949152542373
