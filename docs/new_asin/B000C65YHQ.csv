8095733,2,B000C65YHQ,"H.G. Wells' Invisible Man Original Series is a bit of a disappointment on DVD.  First of all there's no extras at all, the episode menu does tell you when each episode first aired in the 1950s but this is the only trivia you'll get from the DVD.  Which is a shame because a lot of questions go unanswered, primarily, why was this series called H.G. Wells' invisible man when it has nothing at all to do with his invisible man character (Griffin), is not set in the same place and has nothing at all to do with that storyline.  Is the title just cashing in on the success of Wells' novel and the 1930's movie (which was very good by the way) and the subsequent movies of his other novels like War of Worlds and so on? A bit misleading title for the series if this is the case and one which no doubt will cause disappointment if this is the reason you are purchasing.

I didn't buy this because it was based on H.G. Wells novel though so that point didn't bother me, I'm a huge fan of the invisible man genre but have to say was pretty disappointed with this show.  I had ordered the second series but cancelled it after watching the first disc of season one.  The series does show its age in parts with pretty poor acting from some of the support cast (especially the little girl he lives with) and specific episode characters. Poor casting such as middle eastern people being played by white people with bad fake accents make it more of a comedy viewing than it was obviously intended to be.

The basic plot is that Dr Peter Brady a scientist has successfully turned lab animals invisible.  A lapse of attention one day, he turns himself invisible and flees the laboratory when they try and contain him.  He quickly makes a deal with the government to work for them if they'll let him continue with his work so he can find a way to make himself visible again.  Only the government has plans for Brady to be a secret agent which although he is reluctant soon discovers he is quite good at.  Soon Brady is rescuing a hostage from the middle east, boarding Russian ships and using his invisibility to the government's advantage.  In his spare time he's also preventing murders all the while hoping to find the formula to make himself visible again.

Tim Turner (who we obviously only get to see in the first episode before he turns himself invisible then just mostly get to hear his voice) plays Dr Peter Brady and doesn't do a bad job at acting in the lead role. His character suffers from a pretty average script though as well as a limited budget in special effects, you can actually see his faint outline when he's supposed to be invisible in some office scenes.  Not that they bother with doing this much as he's usually bandaged like a someone with severe head injuries (although this is the norm for most invisible man shows/movies).

Like I said if you are buying this because you are a fan of Wells' classic novel give it a miss and get the sensational 1930s film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Invisible-Man/dp/0783240961/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Invisible Man</a>&nbsp;which although a bit different to the book still has follows the basic plot.

Memoirs also has an 1980s Chevy Chase movie based on it which isn't bad (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memoirs-of-an-Invisible-Man/dp/B00009NHC7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memoirs of an Invisible Man</a>).

8095734,5,B000C65YHQ,"When this series made its debut in the late 50's it was an instant hit with TV audiences in both the UK and in America.  As part of a publicity campaign, the name of the actor who played Dr. Peter Brady was Tim Turner (replete with bandages), but was not revealed until 1965 to keep the audiences guessing. The show boasts of some really fabulous special effects for the day; for example, a cigarette that lights and smokes itself and wine drunk from a glass by an ""invisible"" drinker.  Many of the episodes refect the political climate of the Cold War; Peter Brady often is called to thwart the evil designs of foreign spies or assist a friend of a friend who is being blackmailed keeping with a theme similar to ""The Saint."" A complete set of all the episodes are available thru AmazonUK, but this is a good starter set for those who like vintage British sci-fi television with a twist.  The astute observer will notice many fine UK actors in guest spots on this series who would later appear on many other well known ITC programs such as ""Danger Man,"" ""Secret Agent,"" and ""The Prisoner.""",1151798400,16,1090,4.522842639593908
