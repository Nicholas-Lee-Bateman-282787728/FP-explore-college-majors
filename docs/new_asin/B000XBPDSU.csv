3000425,1,B000XBPDSU,half way thru the movie it lost most of the pixels.  and skiped the rest of the way.  poor acting. i wasted  money on t his one.,1203638400,2,128,3.6666666666666665
3000426,3,B000XBPDSU,"When something is based on a true story or actual events in the case of the supernatural one must approach with a certain skepticism. This was my frame of mind after purchasing ""The Expedition"", and upon viewing the film my stance hasn't changed.

The basic plot is this, five friends decide to do a documentary film on an abandoned asylum in Saratoga (just why is bit hard to ascertain but can most likely be chalked up to being young and wanting to do something different) a place which has no history of ""hauntings"" to begin with. Yet upon entering the deteriorating building with graffiti covered walls and plaster strewn floors a mysterious force slowly makes itself known to the group. If this was truly based on a true story then the ghosts were nice enough to the film crew not to scare them right away but gradually increase the tempo the longer they remained in the building.

Before I get onto the negatives I'd like to start off with the films positives, firstly the five film makers are great on camera and really add a sense of authenticity to the film. Their performances seem to have taken a page from the Blair Witch Project in that there is no rehearsed lines to say but everything is done on the fly with cameras rolling. Secondly, the music added to the scenes of them exploring the structures dark corridors and crumbling rooms really helps the film along while at the same time doesn't detract from the viewers experience. Thirdly, the asylum itself is great to explore with the film makers as they trudge their way through its decaying interior. I've always been fascinated with abandoned structures and this point alone made me pony up the funds to buy this film.

Now to the negatives, unfortunately there are ""reenactment"" sequences that take place after the ""expedition"" into the asylum. Cut in between ""actual"" footage are shots at a police station where a couple of the film makers are being interrogated by a detective about ""what really happened"" in the asylum. Its a way for the director to narrate whats going on and why certain things happen on the film and perhaps it was needed. But the acting during these scenes is one of major setbacks for this film, any sense of immersion is snatched away while actors who don't seem comfortable with saying scripted lines try to advance the plot.

Next is the ""supernatural"" part of the film that what could of been its strongest points turns out to be its weakest. For a supposedly ""real"" film the actors are great at displaying real reactions to things that go bump in the night. Yet where the film trips up is when visual ""hints"" are dropped for the viewer that ""hey, there is something spooky here"". By this I mean having the camera get ""fuzzy"" or interference when filming in a room. The effect itself is so out of place I couldn't help but roll my eyes. Other effects include calls for help from an unseen film maker that has gone missing and a ghost girl in a white dress that seems to stalk the crew. What is it with ghost girls in dresses anyway? Was their a memo I missed?

The final negative was what made this a four star to a three star and that was the lead film makers (we'll call him Ed since I forget his name) insistence on filming everything. I found it incredibly difficult to believe that his best friend goes missing and is calling for help yet Ed cant stop lugging his camera around as he searches for him. Only thing that kept running through my mind was ""drop the damn camera and call the cops you doofus"".",1203292800,11,3506,4.549920760697306
3000427,1,B000XBPDSU,"But you would really have to work at it.  The reenactment scenes were painful to watch and the ""live"" footage wasn't much better.  The Canadian filmmakers had a vocabulary largely devoted to the use of the f word, and while I am no prude I prefer some intelligent dialogue in my movies.  I mainly watched this movie out of an interest in the building itself.  I have lived within a 1/2 hour of the Homestead my entire life and was actually in the building a few times while it was the Saratoga County Nursing Home.  I am not Convinced that all of the interior footage was actually filmed in the Homestead.  I can only hope that everyone involved in the making of this film has found a different career path because they were abject failures as filmmakers.",1464566400,5,755,4.474452554744525

I would have given it about a 3 star because I like this realm of horror, but I opted for a one or really a half star because of the fact the F bomb was dropped way too many times.  That one guy really needs to learn to speak without saying F all the time or F'ing Mother F'er  - it became really pathetic towards the end.  Espeically when looking for ""Tom"".  Annoyed me.

The Bad:  1. Was there no one around that could answer the damn phone in those horrible police interrogation scenes?  WTF?
2. Who ever did the sound in this movie should really go back to their day job, it was horrible. It was hard to hear what the people were saying when that crap was on. There was one time in the movie where there was no added background music, this allowed us to actually hear what the people were saying but then after 5 minutes that crappy ass music came back on.
3. The 8mm scenes at the end of the movie was very hard to see what was happening.

Actually, I think this movie could have been a lot more convincing had it not been for the so-called, ""Detective.""

3000441,1,B000XBPDSU,"I wish i could give it at least a two star, but the score, the score was making my ears bleed. It was basically a xylophone and some pounding of three keys using the ""harmonic chorus"" setting. Oh! and a bunch of ""NIGEL!"" ""TOM!"" "" "" ""insert the f- word about 3992832839823920 times"". Seriously, the count for saying the name ""Nigel"" alone was over forty times, i'm glad i didn't keep track of ""TOM"" .

It tried, it really did, the editing was sloppy and probably done in windows movie maker, because that horrible "" break off into pixels""  mode was overused (i think i would have been more entertained if they used the starburst setting, or the twirl in like a newspaper setting!) .
I watch terrible movies as a hobby, but this one was beyond terrible.  I did almost cry laughing when Bill/Pizza tripped and was skipping out of the ""asylum/Tuberculosis infirmary"".
The pictures of the place they were at was the only redeeming thing, but i  highly doubt they filmed at the same location that the stock photos were from.  I will say, i did watch it all, and that's something, so it was watchable.",1435708800,5,1094,4.505050505050505

3000444,1,B000XBPDSU,"There is not much to be added from other one star reviews.  If I had to chose just one (and that would be hard) annoying thing about this movie, it would be the back ground sounds.  Every time, they are interviewing people at the police station (1/3 of the movie)  there are two phones that ring constantly (guess they want you to think it is a busy police station).  The sound track music is annoying, sometimes it seems that they over recorded over something.

Why did I rent this, with all the one star ratings, I guess I wanted to see if this was as poor as everyone said it was, and guess what, it is.

Think I will get a camera, some beer and my friends and make my own movie!  Apparently it is that easy.",1426809600,4,711,4.145985401459854
3000445,1,B000XBPDSU,"I'm going to have to watch this again.  Not because it was good.  Not because it was bad.  I want to count how many times the F word is used.  The characters are practically unable to open their mouths without using it. Example:  F!  I Fing can Fing hear his Fing voice. Where the F can he Fing be?  F!  They talk like this even before they start to get scared.  If you want to occasionally use the word for emphasis then fine, but the extreme over use of it here is a clear sign of uneducated imbeciles unable to express themselves.

These guys are here to make a documentary on the asylum?  From the moment they started filming they were unable to hold a steady camera.  Prepare to get seasick  like Cloverfield.  Some shakiness for effect would be acceptable and even expected after they were scared, even though irritating, but from the get go it was like a six year old playing with his Dads Handycam and it only got worse.  I guess it all started with The Blair Witch Project.  It seems like each movie using this style seems to be shakier than the one before it.  Maybe the shakier the camera is then the more realistic or scary it's supposed to be?

Spoiler?
Other than a couple of quick shadows, nothing ever happens in this movie.  Once Tom disappears you are treated to an hour of the remaining characters roaming the halls calling Tom? with an occasional faint echoing voice responding.  Yawn.  Of course, they keep stupidly separating to look for the missing Tom.  Unfortunately, they didn't all disappear along with their film footage so no one would have to be subjected to watching this mess.

The constant switching to police interrogations was a distraction  although there wasn't much to be distracted from.  The detective doing the interviews was the worst actor in the film.  The detective with the Jay Leno chin would probably have been even worse, but he only makes a couple of short cameo appearances and mumbles a few words.  Speaking of distractions, will somebody please answer that damn phone!  Every time we are switched to the interrogations there is a phone constantly trilling in the background.  I'm sure it's an attempt to make it seem like a busy police station, but it's just plain irritating.

Avoid this piece of garbage at all cost  unless you want to try counting how many times they use the F word.  Sit with your friends and do the count.  That's the only reason to waist your time on this.",1423267200,15,2432,4.555555555555555

The f**kin film has some really interesting ""survivor"" interviews with a f**kin detective... Haha. Just kidding. Whoever played the f**kin detective should never be allowed to f**kin act again. I watched 2 scenes with the f**kin cop and had to skip through the others. So, so bad. Really (insert the film's most used word here) bad. Tom? Has anyone seen Tom?

I don't know why there is music in a f**kin found-footage film, but it's here and it's the same f**kin 1960's Vincent Price horror film piano and synthesizer music on a f**kin 15 second loop.

The soundtracks are so irritating and overwhelming to what sparsely intelligible dialogue there is that I found myself repeatedly turning down the sound. There is one piece of amazing paranormal footage found at 11:39 from the end of the film. Another inexplicable and unmentioned piece of evidence is found at 2:50 from the end. Beware: You'll have to endure nearly two hours of plotless dizzying footage and probably 500 instances of the ""f"" word to get to either of these pieces of evidence, neither of which are discussed or even noticed by the filmmakers.",1414022400,3,676,4.786324786324786
3000455,2,B000XBPDSU,"Poor post-production choices made this film to distracting to even try to give it a chance.  ""Found footage"" should not have a soundtrack - the point is that there should be ambient sound.  The metal/rock soundtrack was only slightly worse than the cheap rip off of the music used behind dialogue in Psycho (violins and dum-dee-dum piano.  The dialogue was hard to hear with poor sound quality to begin with so that made it worse.  And then the God-awful scenes in the police station.  The ""actor"" who played the interrogating officer should hang up his SAG card.  But at least I couldn't pay too much attention to the dialogue in those scenes because apparently that particular police station is poorly manned and has no one to answer the incessantly-ringing phone.
Good building for a set; creepy atmosphere.

If it is a true story about a guy disappearing, it definitely could have been improved by 1) cutting out the F bombs by about 75%.  Trust me, there would still be F bombs a plenty to go around.  2)  Hello? The music was tedious (understatement) 3)  You know they could have put a little plot in there for the audience's sake; this movie had all the excitement of a rousing game of Marco Polo, with nobody saying Polo.

3000457,5,B000XBPDSU,"Admittedly I have an enormous capacity to watch people walk around abandoned houses or institutions for hours on end but I really, really liked this.  I like Canadians too, so I enjoyed the accent.  If they'd filmed more scenes in the dark, or at least cut in a few, I would have enjoyed that.  It did have a plot and plenty of character development as the viewer must decide if the film-maker had recklessly endangered his crew by going there, although the institution had been overrun with fun-seeking teenagers on Halloween night as well.  The people all seem so real, I wish I was cool enough to hang with them. ;) I also enjoyed the fact that there was not graphic violence particularly.  So probably all the things other people didn't like about this movie were what I enjoyed, flaws and all.  It was neat when the color switched to black and white for a scene than back.  I will look for more movies like this and probably watch this one a bunch of times. ;)  I think everyone involved in this film has a lot of potential. Loved it, really. *brazenly swims upstream*

Oh, and that police detective has the worst people skills of any human who's ever lived.  Attila The Hun was a nicer guy and way less sarcastic.  He's so obnoxious he made me want to go out and commit some crimes.  Maybe that's how Canadians see Americans.

If you love f-bombs and three-note piano music being repeated over and over and over and over, you will LOVE this video.

Here's the f*ing bottom line up front: this f*ing movie is a blatant and f*ing shameless f*ing rip-off of the two f*ing Blair Witch movies. DO NOT RENT IT, unless you just want to see the Blair Witch movies in slightly different clothes.

Let's put it this way - if a soda company made a cola with the identical recipe to Coca Cola, they would be sued for infringement, right? Well, consider THIS video to be that soda company, and BLAIR WITCH I & II to be Coca Cola.

Let's compare - Blair Witch vs. The Expedition: the premise of the movie being a group of kids setting out to determine if a place is haunted? Yes. Claims the movie is made up in large part of actual footage shot by the kids? Yup. First scenes of two of the kids videotaping each other and making silly comments about it? Yes. Upon arrival at the location, interview locals about whether the place is haunted? Of course.
Now, lest you think there was some originality... let's compare the other scenes to Blair Witch II! Opens with a kid being interrogated by the police over being responsible for the deaths of the others? Yes. Repeated interviews with same to reveal the plot line? Yup.
And it just goes on and on... so won't bore you with any more of the details. I think you get the picture.

3234923,3,B000XBPDSU,"When something is based on a true story or actual events in the case of the supernatural one must approach with a certain skepticism. This was my frame of mind after purchasing ""The Expedition"", and upon viewing the film my stance hasn't changed.

The basic plot is this, five friends decide to do a documentary film on an abandoned asylum in Saratoga (just why is bit hard to ascertain but can most likely be chalked up to being young and wanting to do something different) a place which has no history of ""hauntings"" to begin with. Yet upon entering the deteriorating building with graffiti covered walls and plaster strewn floors a mysterious force slowly makes itself known to the group. If this was truly based on a true story then the ghosts were nice enough to the film crew not to scare them right away but gradually increase the tempo the longer they remained in the building.

Before I get onto the negatives I'd like to start off with the films positives, firstly the five film makers are great on camera and really add a sense of authenticity to the film. Their performances seem to have taken a page from the Blair Witch Project in that there is no rehearsed lines to say but everything is done on the fly with cameras rolling. Secondly, the music added to the scenes of them exploring the structures dark corridors and crumbling rooms really helps the film along while at the same time doesn't detract from the viewers experience. Thirdly, the asylum itself is great to explore with the film makers as they trudge their way through its decaying interior. I've always been fascinated with abandoned structures and this point alone made me pony up the funds to buy this film.

Now to the negatives, unfortunately there are ""reenactment"" sequences that take place after the ""expedition"" into the asylum. Cut in between ""actual"" footage are shots at a police station where a couple of the film makers are being interrogated by a detective about ""what really happened"" in the asylum. Its a way for the director to narrate whats going on and why certain things happen on the film and perhaps it was needed. But the acting during these scenes is one of major setbacks for this film, any sense of immersion is snatched away while actors who don't seem comfortable with saying scripted lines try to advance the plot.

Next is the ""supernatural"" part of the film that what could of been its strongest points turns out to be its weakest. For a supposedly ""real"" film the actors are great at displaying real reactions to things that go bump in the night. Yet where the film trips up is when visual ""hints"" are dropped for the viewer that ""hey, there is something spooky here"". By this I mean having the camera get ""fuzzy"" or interference when filming in a room. The effect itself is so out of place I couldn't help but roll my eyes. Other effects include calls for help from an unseen film maker that has gone missing and a ghost girl in a white dress that seems to stalk the crew. What is it with ghost girls in dresses anyway? Was their a memo I missed?

The final negative was what made this a four star to a three star and that was the lead film makers (we'll call him Ed since I forget his name) insistence on filming everything. I found it incredibly difficult to believe that his best friend goes missing and is calling for help yet Ed cant stop lugging his camera around as he searches for him. Only thing that kept running through my mind was ""drop the damn camera and call the cops you doofus"".",1203292800,11,3506,4.549920760697306

The Canadian filmmakers had a vocabulary largely devoted to the use of the f word, and while I am no prude I prefer some intelligent dialogue in my movies.  I mainly watched this movie out of an interest in the building itself.  I have lived within a 1/2 hour of the Homestead my entire life and was actually in the building a few times while it was the Saratoga County Nursing Home.  I am not Convinced that all of the interior footage was actually filmed in the Homestead.

They talk like this even before they start to get scared.  If you want to occasionally use the word for emphasis then fine, but the extreme over use of it here is a clear sign of uneducated imbeciles unable to express themselves.

These guys are here to make a documentary on the asylum?  From the moment they started filming they were unable to hold a steady camera.  Prepare to get seasick  like Cloverfield.  Some shakiness for effect would be acceptable and even expected after they were scared, even though irritating, but from the get go it was like a six year old playing with his Dads Handycam and it only got worse.  I guess it all started with The Blair Witch Project.  It seems like each movie using this style seems to be shakier than the one before it.  Maybe the shakier the camera is then the more realistic or scary it's supposed to be?

Spoiler?
Other than a couple of quick shadows, nothing ever happens in this movie.  Once Tom disappears you are treated to an hour of the remaining characters roaming the halls calling Tom? with an occasional faint echoing voice responding.  Yawn.  Of course, they keep stupidly separating to look for the missing Tom.  Unfortunately, they didn't all disappear along with their film footage so no one would have to be subjected to watching this mess.

The constant switching to police interrogations was a distraction  although there wasn't much to be distracted from.  The detective doing the interviews was the worst actor in the film.  The detective with the Jay Leno chin would probably have been even worse, but he only makes a couple of short cameo appearances and mumbles a few words.  Speaking of distractions, will somebody please answer that damn phone!  Every time we are switched to the interrogations there is a phone constantly trilling in the background.  I'm sure it's an attempt to make it seem like a busy police station, but it's just plain irritating.

Boring moronic people running around with a camera looking for non existant ghosts etc. Guy supposedly goes missing, wish this film did. Cops bag one dude after someone dies and it plays out as he's telling the cop, the poor police officer is going to need a vat of alcohol to kill the pain in his head, muwhahaha

Not much more to say, and for the love of god DO NOT WATCH THIS it should have been flushed at conception. Well got to go take some tylenol because honest to god I have a headache coming seriously for real",1382140800,10,660,4.196850393700787
3234966,1,B000XBPDSU,I can sum this movie up in one sentence.  A group of Canadians running around an abandoned building and swearing while looking for another Canadian.  I can't imagine there was a script for this.  I guess my review is about as pointless as this movie.,1380931200,13,250,4.511111111111111
3234967,1,B000XBPDSU,"I literally watched about the first 20 minutes then gave up on it. The police scenes were just horrible acting. And what was with that constant background music during the ""real"" footage of them wandering around a place that apparently wasn't even haunted.

Found Footage film. If you don't like FF, you will not like this. Only true FF fans should watch, even though it is tedious at times, but I still liked it a lot.

I have searched and maybe it is just in front of my face, but I can not find it any where.  What does that say about USER FRIENDLY?  I liked my prime account up until now.  Now I am openly frustrated.

I finally got to view this movie.  These are the kind of movies I like without all the hollywood style cameras and lights.  I would give it a two thumbs up.  Yes it is along the style of the Blair Witch but much better.  It is a movie that if you follow these types you will love.  If you prefer HOLLY WOOD FANCY it might not thrill you.",1372982400,,666,3.859259259259259
3234973,1,B000XBPDSU,"Worst f*ing film ever. These Canucks should be dipped in maple syrup, with DVDs of this thing stick to them, then beaten with hockey sticks, and left out in the Great White North so this video can't infect the rest of humanity.

If you love f-bombs and three-note piano music being repeated over and over and over and over, you will LOVE this video.

Here's the f*ing bottom line up front: this f*ing movie is a blatant and f*ing shameless f*ing rip-off of the two f*ing Blair Witch movies. DO NOT RENT IT, unless you just want to see the Blair Witch movies in slightly different clothes.

Let's put it this way - if a soda company made a cola with the identical recipe to Coca Cola, they would be sued for infringement, right? Well, consider THIS video to be that soda company, and BLAIR WITCH I & II to be Coca Cola.

Let's compare - Blair Witch vs. The Expedition: the premise of the movie being a group of kids setting out to determine if a place is haunted? Yes. Claims the movie is made up in large part of actual footage shot by the kids? Yup. First scenes of two of the kids videotaping each other and making silly comments about it? Yes. Upon arrival at the location, interview locals about whether the place is haunted? Of course.
Now, lest you think there was some originality... let's compare the other scenes to Blair Witch II! Opens with a kid being interrogated by the police over being responsible for the deaths of the others? Yes. Repeated interviews with same to reveal the plot line? Yup.
And it just goes on and on... so won't bore you with any more of the details. I think you get the picture.

8227800,1,B000XBPDSU,"I tired, I made it about 10 minutes in.

At one part there's this scene where all you can here is the woman behind the camera laughing. Obnoxiously. At literally nothing. No one else on scene is laughing,but every five seconds there's this annoying giggle.

I legitimately couldn't get past it because for the entire 10-15 minutes I watched, she's pretty much giggling over nothing the entire time.",1496793600,,398,4.838235294117647
8227801,2,B000XBPDSU,"I only got through 23 minutes of it. I have it in my watchlist and may be able to finish it later, but I don't know. I mainly started watching it because the Homestead building is a little over a half hour from where I live, and I explored all over the area when I was in my late teens/early 20's.

Aside from the ""local"" curiosity, I had to stop it just after they entered the basement. I just couldn't take it. The interrogation scenes were horrible, and whoever did the sound design for this thing.. Really -- you didn't need that many telephones ringing throughout ALL of the interrogation scenes.. It was incredibly distracting.. And.. Typewriters? It was 2004, not 1977 for crying out loud!

When they began exploring the interior, they made a big deal about a dumbwaiter... ""..Is this a body chute?"" and ""...I think it was for sending dishes up or something silly like that.."" Seriously. It's called a dumbwaiter. They walk into an old kitchen and she says ""what the H is this thing?!"" ... It's called a ventilation hood. They continue walking and come upon a small room. ""there's some F old S "" and then she exclaims ""there's a F chair in here!"" Yes. People use chairs quite a bit, you see, and they've been around for a very long time, so it's not unheard of that this facility utilized them...

At this point I was starting to feel torn between wanting to see this train-wreck, and wanting to shut the thing off.. Kept watching for a few minutes more. The cameraman gets annoyed that he can't drink his beer and film at the same time he's holding his flashlight (whose batteries are dying) so the female carries his beer... They look around (still holding the beer) and the cameraman says ""oh S. We better get outta here if that's where the F  rumors are.<what?!>"" (still holding his beer) then ""keep going, keep going -- this makes me want to F  S."" (still holding his beer.) Keep in mind that nothing has really happened.. At all..

The only cool thing was that a character was wearing an ""Oswego State"" sweatshirt. My old alma mater. That's it.

I couldn't take it. I Turned it off.

Just awful.  By the way, my original review was denied, because apparently using * in bad words still flags it, so I shortened them the first letter of the bad words.",1494547200,,2263,4.473300970873787

Nothing happens of interest in this movie...nothing. It really is just a bunch of 20-somethings lost in a decrepit building, looking for each other. That's it. And personally, the fact that one of the guys says the f-word every other second was annoying. I don't have a problem with swearing. I normally don't care but it was really irritating after a while.",1477353600,3,493,4.613636363636363

8227806,4,B000XBPDSU,"Its fascinating watch because it really happened. Life, yours or mine, is boring if someone is watching it unless were living the fantasy realm of our famous people in hollywood. So I can put up with it because I can almost feel the anguish and anxiety of the folks in the team. Imagine losing your friend/ colleague and the you don't know where he is. Death is better at least there is a path to closure after some time of grief. But missing persons are harder to let go. I also like watching these real events on film because to me films are not just for entertainment but I try to gleam tips lessons and whathaveyou from them. It can save a life.
I hope this team could feel that by filming this account of their experience their friend Tom's memory is honored and his family has some comfort to bear just knowing how it all began.
