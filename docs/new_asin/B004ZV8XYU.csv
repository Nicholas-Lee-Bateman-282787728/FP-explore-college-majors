8450469,5,B004ZV8XYU,This DVD is a great substitute for those times when attending Giselle's class is inconvenient.  The forty-five minute yoga session is challenging and the optional fifteen minute meditation is very effective. This yoga/meditation workout is perfect for relieving stress and creating energy.  Love it.,1344297600,,299,5.7727272727272725

8450471,5,B004ZV8XYU,Great beginner session with the option of advanced beginner practice. The guided savasana is a bonus and the music for this segment was well chosen as it is conducive to the meditation during this final restorative pose.,1313280000,2,220,4.972972972972973
8450472,5,B004ZV8XYU,"I've always wanted to try yoga, but was a little hesitant because I wasn't sure if it would be challenging enough for me.  I was wrong, I love this DVD.  Ms. Toner provides variations for the different exercises that allow a person to use the same DVD as they advance.  The DVD is easy to follow, but very challenging.  I have experience in the martial arts, weight lifting, running and biking.  I wanted to improve my flexibility as well as my core strength and I've seen great improvement in both.  But, I was really surprised at how the program has helped me to relax.  The extended meditation portion is amazing after a tough day.  I couldn't be happier with this DVD and I HIGHLY recommend it.",1313193600,2,698,4.484126984126984
