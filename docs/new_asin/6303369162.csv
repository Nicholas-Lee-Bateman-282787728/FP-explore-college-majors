659474,5,6303369162,Very good Dramedy about the New Age movement of the mid Nineties. Weller is very sexy and reminds me of Thomas Jane a bit. I'm glad that it is finally out on DVD.,1268006400,,162,3.9393939393939394
659475,5,6303369162,"This is still one of the sharpest dark comedies around about LA, specifically, and failed yuppie dreams , generally, that I have ever seen. Makes such Steve Martin attempts, like LA Story, seem lame. Infinitely quotable lines: ""Money isn't money! Money is an expression of something else!"" Peter Weller and Judy Davis are pitch perfect. The NEW AGE trappings that abound in the movie are not just scatter shot- there is a flirtation with BDSM, there is alternative medicine, and assisted suicide; there is applied and misapplied Taoist and Buddhist philosophy and there is real satire on the Consumerist Culture. Plus there is Patricia Heaton well before Everybody Loves Raymond, and  the enigmatic Patrick Bachau being ...umm...enigmatic, and Adam West as Peter's kind of slimy, slippery, and distant Dad. So good here!

For a kind of similar experience, see Albert Brooks' ""Lost in America.""
Then re-think ""American Beauty.""

THIS FILM is NOT a MESS, and I'd be thankful if folks who ""review"" in that vein would at least back up their opinions with some discussion about the film itself, beyond one sentence.

Please, powers that own the rights to this film! Release the DVD! Because every old VHS I've scrounged up plays like they were baking in the bargain bin sun at the dollar store's front window.",1177200000,13,1304,4.9953917050691246
659476,5,6303369162,"Ten years after its release, Steve Martin's LA Story has a cult following for its adept interpretation of vapid and decadent Los Angelinos. Though LA Story came out in 1990 and seems to lampoon the 80s, Michael Tolkin goes way beyond his collaborative work with Robert Altman(The Player) with this pitch black comedy.
The film is way ahead of its time. Hollywood has yet to examine the decadent 90s in any way. Here we have characters who are more Clinton era than American Beauty. Pretty astute, considering that the film was released in 1994!
Look for top performances from Peter Weller, Judy Davis, and great supporting work from Adam West, Sandra Seacat, and a pre-Pulp Fiction Samuel Jackson. Hopefully, some of the great camera work an slick visuals will find its way on to DVD in the near future.",1024444800,16,803,4.784172661870503
659477,1,6303369162,This film is a mess. It features a load of stars and made no sense at all. The great Icelandic actress Maria Ellingsen appears once or twice and is her exceptional skills are wasted in this mess. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,1001548800,,232,4.4186046511627906
659478,5,6303369162,"Michael Tolkin's ""The New Age"" was the most scathing movie indictment of the American dream gone Sonoma catalog since Albert Brooks' brilliant satire ""Lost In America"". ""The New Age"" re-teams the ""Tracy & Hepburn"" of indie film, Peter Weller and Judy Davis, who were also the wacked-out couple in ""Naked Lunch"". Instead of heading off in an RV to go ""find themselves"", Judy and Peter decide to ""simplify"" thier over-extended Yuppie lifestyle by chucking it all and opening up a Beverly Hills boutique. Hilarity ensues....right? Actually, the movie takes a more low-key,sometimes cruel, black comedy approach to its subjects as they proceed to go into a tandem midlife crisis. Along the way, most trendy southern California fads are lampooned, recalling the film ""Serial"", which savaged the Bay Area Yuppie/New Age scene in the same fashion. Good supporting performances abound; the biggest surprise is Adam ""Batman"" West, who is priceless as Weller's father. West plays the wryly acerbic, aging Lothario with much aplomb.(Where has he been?!) Highly recommended.",970790400,14,1062,5.365269461077844
659479,5,6303369162,"This movie meant a lot more to me after I lived in Phoenix, Arizona for a year, which is as far west as I want to go for the rest of my life.  It's much more interesting to observe empty, soul-less people from a safe  distance.  It's funny.  See ""The Rapture,"" too.  Thanks.",918086400,8,274,4.09433962264151

THE NEW AGE: Some people are born with a silver spoon in their mouths; some are destined to die that way. Nothing New Age helps Peter and Kat: not yoga, retreats, gurus, visualization or even Tibetan bowls. And Spirituality is expensive! They need a New, Improved Age. But aint that always the way? Just when you think youve hit rock bottom they come along and take away the rock.

The real question is whether this is an obscenely funny, deeply dark, sardonic skewering of the New Age scene portrayed as a fall from grace of two worthy victimsor whether its a dead serious drama about two people attempting to establish some connection but limited in their communication to the only language they knowNew Age clichs. Is it a mordant mocking of the shallow ultra-hippeople whod opt for suicide before theyd accept a lower standard of livingattempting to find depth, or is it a complex portrait of the pain and frustration of enduring a spiritual crisis, no matter what your socioeconomic level, while surrounded by the self-righteous?

7848120,5,6303369162,"'The New Age' gives us starlight and volcanoes coming together as Katherine Witner (Judy Davis) and the epitome of hip, cool and jazz style in Peter Witner (Peter Weller), an upscale couple quickly finding themselves on a downwardly mobile fast track.  Adding to the melee is their imminent breakup. This film is like a museum quality painting or sculpture. (It's criminal it isn't available on dvd.)",1405468800,,400,5.0606060606060606
7848121,5,6303369162,"Who would have thought that a social comedy rooted in the early 90's LA recession (before the tech bubble, before the mortgage-backed-securities bubble, etc.) could still be so vital?  2008 rebooted this movie to the top of the class, where I think it remains.  Judy Davis and Peter Weller create fabulous friction (as they also did in Cronenberg's ""Naked Lunch""), but, in this case, without the surrealism.  What has probably been lost to the plutocracy Peter and Catherine casually aspire to is any interest in an alternative - where are the Rachel Rosenthals (bless her heart) of today?  First time you see it, the mystics and sensualists and eurotrash may seem marginal; they are not.  Fear and failure and loss are the wages of misplaced confidence, unearned success and too much shopping - the warnings come early and often.  While they sink, the principals skirt death, and end up where they were always meant to be - that's true comic hell.",1378339200,6,948,4.857142857142857

7848123,4,6303369162,"Yes, I concur that this movie needs to be released on DVD. I guess it's probably too sprawling and ambitious and weird for mass tastes, and its tone is sort of uncertain - one doesn't always know whether it's supposed to be a parody, a drama, or what. But this doesn't get across how consistently fun it is, and how many, yes, great performances there are. Judy Davis is fabulous as always, and Peter Weller is wonderfully sleazy and smarmy and vacuous. (What happened to him, anyway?) I have seen it three times now and I am desperate to see it again, especially as I now live in Paris and sometimes just need a good dose of L.A. The movie is also, not incidentally, just gorgeous to look at. (And this may have something to do with the uncertainty of tone - no matter how ridiculously these characters are behaving, they and their surroundings are always beautifully, lusciously photographed.) Oh, and whoever that actress is who plays the snooty friend of Judy Davis - she's great. So, yes - DVD!! Let us raise the cry.
As a side note, The Player is probably a tighter, more coherent sort of movie than The New Age, but I much prefer The New Age, flaws and all.",1304553600,4,1164,4.44392523364486
7848124,4,6303369162,"The economy is destroyed when banks make loans to bad-risk borrowers.  Those who have never been poor suddenly are and must cope with an altered reality.  All of this sounds familiar, except that the movie was released in 1994.  The protagonists, played by Peter Weller and Judy Davis, open up a boutique clothing store which promptly goes belly-up and its failure forces them to seek new 'opportunities'.  Part comedy, part drama, part satire of L.A. materialism, narcissism, and trendoid culture, the parts never come together to form a seamless whole and the result is something of a genre mish-mash.  There are clever scenes, memorable lines, good performances and some spot-on satire, but the film is not as strong as the script and the result is a cinematic misfire.  Watch for interesting supporting parts played by Samuel L. Jackson, Adam West,  John Diehl, Patricia Heaton, et al.",1271894400,,889,5.0479452054794525
