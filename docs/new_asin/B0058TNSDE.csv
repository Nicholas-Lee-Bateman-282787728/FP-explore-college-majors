4601522,5,B0058TNSDE,"It is simply a fun watching an animation of school kids mimicking the adults while smart ass Johnny commented the events well reflecting a brutal meaningless surrounding existence in picturesque Australia changed not much since an original B&W 1967 year anime version.

Today, probably, such a kid ought to be referred to a psychologist with all the records following him upon a life spin and parents could a little to do.",1324080000,2,422,4.943661971830986
4601523,1,B0058TNSDE,"Unwatchable. I stopped viewing about 10 minutes into the movie. Not because it was offensive, mind you. It was just poorly done in just about every way for the short time I was able to endure.",1445472000,,192,4.361111111111111

4601535,2,B0058TNSDE,"A little too juvenile for my taste, with the predictable ""Little Johnny"" jokes. One amusing thing is that since this is an Australian production, I heard several new variations of the old jokes we all grew up with.",1429056000,,214,4.657894736842105

4601547,1,B0058TNSDE,"Crude without the benefit of actually being funny. ""NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN"" is printed in large letters on the cover, which is ironic because only a child would have found this crap entertaining. The animation was in FLASH, a fact you can never forget while watching. One has to wonder how such low quality animation ever made it into theatrical release.

The bottom line is this, if you are looking for a good laugh, look elsewhere.",1417651200,,436,4.7368421052631575
4601548,5,B0058TNSDE,Absolutely silly. You will laugh...or admit it is a very adult movie. Not suitable for children.,1416009600,,96,5.0625
4601549,4,B0058TNSDE,"Not what I would call top notch adult animation but, anything that makes me laugh out loud when I am by myself and several times is worth at least four stars.

While playing in the backyard, Little Johnny kills a honeybee. His father sees him killing the honeybee and angrily says, ""No honey for you for one month!"" Later that afternoon, Johnny's dad catches him tearing the wings off a butterfly. ""That's it! No butter for you for one month!"" says his dad. Later that evening as Johnny's mother cooks dinner, a cockroach run across the kitchen floor. She jumps and stomps on it, and then looks up to find Little Johnny and her husband watching her. Little Johnny looks at his father and says, ""Are you going to tell her, Dad, or do you want me to?""",1415059200,3,749,4.427536231884058

4601555,1,B0058TNSDE,"""Australia's Answer to ""Family Guy"" But Wronger!""

That was the tag-line that Amazon had put on this movie.  As several others have mentioned it is not even remotely the same kind of humor as family guy, it is indeed (as one may guess) nothing but a poorly strung together set of little johnny jokes.  The humor falls flat seeming to depend highly on the concept that swearing is funny.  Because almost all of the jokes the punchline is Johnny swearing.  The thing about little Johnny jokes is they are burn out pretty easily, the more you hear them the less funny they are.  On top of that most of these are jokes you have heard over and over again.  It fizzles and dies pretty quickly.

A more appropriate tag line would be: ""Old rehashed jokes, nothing at all like ""Family Guy"", and much worse""",1404259200,6,797,4.486111111111111
4601556,4,B0058TNSDE,Pretty enjoyable animated movie from down under. Advertises as Family Guy like but wronger. Not really so though. But pretty good,1403740800,,129,5.190476190476191
4601557,1,B0058TNSDE,"I struggled through the first 20 minutes before giving up. The animation was just fair and the jokes were stale and the movie really dragged on. Very slow, plodding animation. There were no real laughs. Meh!",1402704000,4,207,4.777777777777778
4601558,4,B0058TNSDE,do not let kids watch this. this is super funny and if you don't know little johnny jokes then you won't appreciate the humor.,1379548800,,126,4.291666666666667
4601559,1,B0058TNSDE,"Funny movie but only watch on PC as it is in south pacific format!!! Tried the Blue Ray and the regular  DVD.... Called customer service and they said it was American format, but no good!!

4601560,5,B0058TNSDE,Best funny movie. I will watch again and again. I love the little Johnny jokes. When is part 2 comming out?,1338768000,,107,4.142857142857143
4601561,1,B0058TNSDE,"It's so rare that I give a movie a one star review, but this was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen... little needs to be said about it except that basically every one of the jokes is recycled from old Little Johnny jokes, so if you've heard them, you've seen the movie, the animation is awful, looks as if it was made in the '70s, and the plot is barely there.

I try not to be a cynic, but when you watch a movie without a fraction of originality, it's hard not to be.  Even the attempts at being ""offensively funny"" with the minorities portrayed fall so flat on their face that you can't even feel offended.

If you have never heard a joke in your life, then this may give you a laugh or two... other than that, this movie is impossible to recommend on any level.",1333411200,3,779,4.1118421052631575

8462244,5,B0058TNSDE,"This is not a family movie unless your kids are all grown up!  Not for the easily offended, but I found it to be funny as hell, and if you are a fan of Kevin ""Bloody"" Wilson, you'll understand quickly how Little Johnny got to be ""our Little Johnny"".",1461024000,,249,4.081632653061225

8462248,5,B0058TNSDE,"I'm not worthy... To speak to the mastermind behind ""Little Johnny"", would be to assume that I was on the same level as a Comedy Genius, and I'm no where close. Maybe ask Seth M. Or Matt and Trey. The parents of Rick & Morty. These would be worthy reviewers.
