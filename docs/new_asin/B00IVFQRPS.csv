6300162,4,B00IVFQRPS,"I'll toss lots of gold stars at any movie with Ricardo Darin in it -- including this one. While it is not  in the same elevated category of ""The Secrets in Their Eyes"" it is good because of Darin. Music intriguing as well.",1409097600,3,222,4.162790697674419

6300169,4,B00IVFQRPS,interesting story with unexpected end. Darin pivots the film around his role and acting. Actors in secondary roles are less imaginative and interesting. He is way above the rest of the cast.,1420502400,,190,4.96875

6300171,4,B00IVFQRPS,"Writer/Director Patxi Amezcua (with Alejo Flah as co-writer) presents this Argentinean thriller Sptimo, essentially a two person drama that is powerful and predictable - until the very well conceived ending.

Sebastin (Ricardo Darn) and Delia (Beln Rueda) are divorced, have two children, Luna and Luca, and Delia is attempting to force Sebastin's hand for full custody of the children (the children are happy kids equally devoted to both parents. Sebastin arrives to take the children to school and Delia makes him promise to prevent the children from playing on the lengthy stairs that lead form the 7th floor to the lobby. Delia leaves, Sebastin gives in to the children's pleas to walk down the stairs, and the children go missing. Sebastin is a lawyer and must be in court for an important case, but when the children go missing he spends every moment looking for them - with a bit of help from the janitor and a police officer who lives in the building. Ultimately Delia is notified and the two await information from what appears to be a kidnapping. The children are finally released and the remainder of the film is a conflict that must not be shared in a review.  Suffice it to say that the ultimate revenge served to Sebastin's wife is as devastating as the `kidnapping'.

Darin and Rueda find the right degree of friction and compassion in this well-constructed film. The story has been done before, but this version has true grit - and intelligence. Grady Harp, December 14",1419552000,3,1485,4.838582677165355

8645653,1,B00IVFQRPS,"I love most of Ricardo Darin's movies, I knew this one had low ratings everywhere else but hey! we thought it can't be that bad.... it was terrible.
The story was so fake, and it was one of those movies that seems they are acting so fast that you don't believe anything.
I left thinking how does a director manage to make even Ricardo Darin look bad?
The main actress on that last scene... I mean...the children... just bad acting.

I seriously almost felt I needed to say it was OK because this movie even managed to make me feel embarrassed
for the cast, the writer and the director.

I can confidently say that this is Ricardo's worst movie.",1452038400,,644,4.4033613445378155
