8320164,4,B001LYD2EK,"This is another delightful Andre Rieu show. However, buyer beware: ""Dancing through the Skies"" is exactly the same DVD as ""Live in Dresden,"" also sold here on amazon.com. I made the mistake of ordering ""Dancing,"" after already having ""Live"" in my collection. Fortunately, the associated seller, importcds, agreed to its return.",1263686400,4,327,5.431372549019608
8320165,5,B001LYD2EK,"I am so glad I pre-ordered this one. This concert had all the same sophisticated playing by Andre and the Orchestra but, also there was a different feel to all of it.  I sit in America accustomed to our ways and so enjoy watching the response of people in different countries to his music.  I am very impressed with this DVD and would recommend it for anyone. Thank you again for supplying my addiction to this mans music.",1262649600,2,422,4.397435897435898
8320166,3,B001LYD2EK,"Everything is in place.  The costumes are festive.  The wedding couple takes center aisle.  The debutantes are paired off, ceremoniously dancing to perfection.  And the Maestro is in fine form.  As the great master of ceremonies, he conducts his orchestra, the audience, and the performances superbly. With suave smoothness and good humor, he has seldom hosted a better, more tightly themed evening.

But something went wrong.  Unfortunately, whenever the camera shifts around it sticks on images, showing a sort of stagnant catch of every subject, leaving jarring, blurred shots--not unlike '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andre-Rieu-The-Homecoming/dp/B000H0MNIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andre Rieu - The Homecoming</a>' DVD.  Pit Weyrich directed it, and Hans Penders was the senior editor.  Something happened on the way to shooting and processing the DVD, and like a perfect wedding with pictures that don't turn out right, we feel that the event has somehow been marred.

And that's a shame really.  Most of the selections rarely repeat other DVD outings (except for the perennial 'Blue Danube,' which Rieu and company continue to do ad nauseum--even if it is a classic waltz.  How many times can you laugh when he stops the piece and leaves the dancers awkwardly in a lurch?).  Australian singer Mirusia Louwerse performs one of the outstanding highlights with his orchestra, and The Platin Tenors as well as Carmen Monarcha provide familiar brilliance.  The pacing, overall, is vivacious and entertaining.  I am particularly glad my version has a CD to go with the DVD.  How can you go wrong with that?!

I was hard pressed to rate this DVD two stars, but I feel many will find the DVD to be too distracting as a visual experience.  The defects are only noticeable when the camera moves around, so it remains still during most of the performances.  For diehard Andre Rieu fans, this night of ""Dancing Through the Skies"" is a must, but most people will be better off buying the CD and renting the DVD first to see if it is worth buying later.
