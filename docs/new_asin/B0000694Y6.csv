8323746,1,B0000694Y6,This movie suck . I would rate this movie minus 100 . You can see the person missed the kicking or hitting . It is like a home movie made with probably less than $100. to make .The sound effect is very bad . This movies is like in the 1970's but to me alot worst . Don't buy or rent it . It is just a waste of my time .,1078185600,,319,3.4444444444444446
8323747,4,B0000694Y6,"""THE STRIKE"" is a martial arts movie full of INCREDIBLE kickboxing action and plenty of foxy babes! Two of the stand-outs are Stephanie Sinclair, who has a VERY revealing shower scene, and Autumn Vena, who plays a herion-addicted hooker in an Asian gangster's private bordello. Some of the fighting is this movie is especially vicious, so basically there's never a dull moment! Catch it - you won't be sorry!",1029456000,,408,4.927536231884058
