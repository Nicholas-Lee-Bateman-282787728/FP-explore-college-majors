8182829,5,B000O598D6,This was a great educational program for kids! I loved the idea of animation mixed with real life.  Can't think of any programs doing that right now. We can't want to see the new episodes.,1189296000,,188,4.371428571428571
8182830,5,B000O598D6,"I bought this video for my kids and not only did they love it, my wife and I both thought it was awesome for kids. The characters were great to watch. Tol was engaging and Dr. Iz was awesome.  My children really enjoyed the IZOTRONIC song and dance in the extras. Bring on Episode Two!!!",1186617600,,287,4.218181818181818

8182832,4,B000O598D6,"I bought this DVD for my Niece's They are always glad to get a DVD from aunt Cat (Smile) They really enjoyed the music and animation in the beginning and then added there own ideas about shooting stars when the kids on the DVD gave their opinions.
I must admit that I enjoyed watching the extras. Especially the one that gives a more detailed explanation about shooting stars for the older kids who love space.",1184803200,,410,4.48
8182833,5,B000O598D6,"My 10-year-old daughter and her best friend both watched ""Mystery Of The...Shooting Stars"" yesterday, and their first comment after it was over was ""Are there any more of these?"" :-) They loved the artwork (particularly the asteroid with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and all the planets with silly faces), as well as the Dr. Iz character.  As for me, I got a special kick out of the opening sequence - it had a groovy, late-60's/early 70's vibe to it, similar to some of the animation I grew up with! While I already knew what shooting stars actually were, I did learn something new about how and why stars twinkle. Cute *and* informative. There's something for everyone in this first offering from Mighty Mojo Studios and I highly recommend it.",1184544000,,753,4.704545454545454
