1963057,2,B0000ZG0OK,"I bought the DVD because I like Bo Derek, and also because I liked the DVD cover. There are also some other respected actors here, like Stacy Keach and Geoffrey Lewis. Like Bo, they too do a good job, but unfortunately, the script is what kills the movie. It felt more or less incomprehencible. It would have been fun to see Bo together with these good actors in a good movie. But ""Sunstorm"" is not good. Only recommended to those who want to have a complete DVD collection of Bo Derek's or Keach's or Lewis's films.",1187481600,5,516,4.385416666666667
1963058,4,B0000ZG0OK,"This film isn't a ""Enemy of the State"" caliber film but for the budget it has a very interesting plot line.  As far as conspiracy theories go, this film has one that seems to have a kernel of truth to it.  We're talking black bag, black budgets and black ops on a very dirty international scale.  I gave it three stars for the CONspiracy theory, and opening assasination and an extra star for the Female Forms.

8004815,1,B0000ZG0OK,"If you are looking for a Bo Derek film, I suggest any of her other outings.  She barely appears and is more covered up than your grandma.  Her role depends upon her 'acting ability'.  If they stamped that on the front of the DVD cover, sales would have ranged from zero up to perhaps a dozen...

The film is a typical post WW2 European film. Emulating James Bond with gorgeous locations, beautiful women, and lots of guns, it puts those elements together with the wit, humour, and finesse of a student taking 'Introduction to film direction'.  No character is admirable so the 'drama' never arises.  It seems to concern a series of kidnappings by one 'evil group' hired to put pressure on a powerful family.  After fifteen minutes, you start nodding off, hoping the older women kidnapped do something...anything.  But besides running around or sitting still, listening to attorneys, there's no action.  To clarify that it's not a typical Bo Derek film, she is thoroughly 'covered up' at all times and, besides one minute of bikini wearing by one actress, everyone else is too.  Outside of the subject matter, this could easily be a PG-13 film...easily...",1347321600,,1154,4.841836734693878
8004816,1,B0000ZG0OK,"1 of 5 stars for the boring movie Sunstorm. Even though it was 90 minutes, it still seemed long and boring. Lots of people running, driving, fighting and chasing all without much purpose other than to cause another poorly done fight. The saving grace is the four sisters are all pretty. Save your popcorn and find another movie. Oh, Bo Derek has a minor role and not worth it. I do not recommend this one.",1261353600,,405,4.413333333333333
8004817,1,B0000ZG0OK,"Hot chicks who can't act in a movie by screenwriters who can't write.  But San Juan looks great.

The real actors seem to do a lot of sitting around and talking.  The non-actors do all the moving around and stuff.  The story is convoluted.

I seem to recall a series of films by someone named Andy Sedaris or something.  MALIBU EXPRESS, etc.  They starred Playboy Playmates who always took a break from some ridiculous spy story to take showers or lay out naked by swimming pools or something without clothes on.  They were lame and badly-produced but guys watched them because they provided some visual stimulation.

SUNSTORM feels like one of those movies...and they forgot the visual stimulation, if ya know what I mean.  Even the scenes inside a strip club in this movie are as chaste as any ""Charlie's Angels"" episode from the 1970s.

It really doesn't rise any higher than that.",1257292800,5,884,4.712418300653595
