8309226,4,B001HOBPFC,"Four years before they would work together in The Killing - Series 2, Sofie Grbl and Ken Vedsegaard are nowhere near any prisons or army barracks in this 2005 comedy. Vedsegaard plays Poul, the hopeless magician who performs in front of very small crowds in shopping centres until one day his box of tricks is stolen. By chance he meets a guy working in insurance who convinces Poul to become a ""ghostbuster"". Poul then meets Lark (Grbl) who fully believes that Poul is the real thing. Could romance be in the air?
Den rette nd is a fairly amusing piece and runs just short of 90 minutes. It is entirely in Danish with English subtitles. There is a decent looking Behind the Scenes extra on the disc but unfortunately no subtitles to accompany the Danish audio.
Both Vedsegaard and Grbl perform equally well and are supported by a decent cast including from The Killing 2 Carsten Bjrnlund (Major Christian Sgaard) who plays the son of one of Poul's victims Herr Rasmussen, played by Troels Munk (Buchard - The Killing 1). From Borgen Lisbeth Wulff pops up working as an insurance manager.
Both Vedsegaard and Grbl went into this film having had recent TV successes with Vedsegaard as a young Dane in the Fifties in Krniken and Grbl having completed the Cold Feet style series Nikolaj og Julie and the moving film Aftermath.
