From the mirrors, to the bathroom, to salt and superstitions... Of the origins we know nothing about. And they packed in a way that was amusing to watch and very easy to follow along... would recommend any one and everyone to watch this... Super excited, took me forever to track this down.",1471305600,,449,4.487804878048781

OK.  To be honest, I think Jesse Teeters is totally adorable and a hilarious actor with loads of charm.  He plays ""Joe"" in this fascinating documentary on the importance of inventions that we take for granted every day.  But he also plays pretty much every one of the inventors, and most of the guys in situations before the inventions, and he has the most remarkable ability to look great in almost every costume, hair style, mustache, beard, etc... while maintaining the image of an average ""Joe.""

Apart from him, this really is an interesting, informative, well told, fun to watch documentary on all sorts of things that make our lives a lot easier.  Plus unexpected discoveries and inventiones that started civilization and changed the way people do what they do, and think what they think.

And yes, it is a FUN To Watch Documentary!

Hopefully Amazon will have it one day, but until then try to catch it on The History Channel.  Or go to their site to see if it is available.",1364947200,12,1019,4.648044692737431
