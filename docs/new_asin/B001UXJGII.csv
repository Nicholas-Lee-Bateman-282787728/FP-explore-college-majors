3815828,5,B001UXJGII,"Welcome back, Maxwell Smart -- he of the cone of silence, the shoe phone, the last minute inexplicable save and the childlike obliviousness.

Fortunately nothing much changes in the third season of ""Get Smart,"" with Don Adams as the not-so-bright spy with an endless arsenal of strange devices and odd sayings, who tirelessly works to keep the free world free. It's a smooth, polished ride through a string of eccentric crises, with lots of slapstick, movie homages, and the occasional game of lethal ping-pong.

It starts off with a bang when everyone at Control is at risk when KAOS's League of Imposters manages to infiltrate their organization -- meaning that there are doppelgangers of everyone, including Max himself (""Looks like he's got a bad case of tight underwear""). Now he has to prove his true identity... just in time to be send to Central America to find a captured president. And pose as a flamenco dancer.

And the stalwart Smart is confronted by many new dangers -- a ghostly informant, budget cutbacks, a sonic boom weapon, an olive transmitter swallowed by a country singer, a superpowered robot designed to kill Hymie, the malevolent Dr. Yes, infiltrating a biker gang, poisoning by a KAOS siren, the mysterious Dr. T, being framed by a one-handed man, the loss of an incriminating Little Black Book, a deadly amusement park, kamikaze pigeons, a sabotaged track competition, and the sinister third spy network ACB.

""Get Smart Season Three"" has everything you'd want in a spy spoof -- lots of homages to movies (""The Maltese Falcon,"" ""DOA,"" ""Dr No"") and television (""The Avengers,"" ""The Fugitive""), absurd plots against world peace (KAOS hippies compelling people to murder through bad folk-rock!), and extremely improbable methods of stopping them. The best thing about the third season is simply that it doesn't change a thing about itself.

Basically the third season is about on even keel with the one that precedes it -- lots of slapsticky action (including Max trying to sheath a sword), weird problems and bizarre gadgets. And it's cleverly written as well (""The world is going to be destroyed in another 45 minutes, you schtupid! This is no time to stop for traffic lights!""), especially with some fun pokes at US government (""We're the only secret organization in the world that nobody ever heard of"").

Don Adams is the heart of the series, with his quirky face, nasal voice, odd body language and confident catchphrases (""And loving it!"") -- he gets to do some fun stuff in Season Three, such as impersonate a king (""Ah yes... I remember the well""), play Pygmalian to a mousy children's author, as well as briefly getting to be Chief of Control. He also turns out to be the worst roommate in the history of the world.

Barbara Feldon plays a wonderful straight woman to Max's goofiness, but we do get to see how she feels about Max when she chooses to leave CONTROL and marry someone else. Edward Platt shines as the long-suffering Chief, who has to deal with Max's constant idiocy. And Bernie Kopell and King Moody are brilliant as Max's archnemesis and his dumb sidekick, especially when they have to team up with Max to save the world (""I may be a killer but I am not a peeping Tom!"").

The third season of ""Get Smart"" stays smart by not really changing anything, but continuing with the whacked-out plots against world peace, and the dim spy who is our only hope. I asked you not to tell me that!",1236556800,22,3432,4.805084745762712

3815981,5,B001UXJGII,"Get Smart has been one of my favorite television shows since I was a kid. As a kid, the fun for me was the antics of comic genius Don Adams. As an adult , half of shows fun is trying to catch all the references to the spy movies and television shows that Get Smart brilliantly satirizes. The other half is still the antics of Don Adams.

The third season of Get Smart aired from September 1967 to April 1968. This set has all 26 uncut and remastered episodes spread out over 4 single-sided dual-layered dvds.

The episodes on this set are:

Video: The remastering done on Get Smart is incredible. The show is presented in its original full frame 1:33 ratio and looks fantastic. The episodes look clean and bright. The colors are vivid and really pop. It really is a revelation after watching drab washed out prints on television for years.

Audio: The only audio track on this set is English 2.0 stereo. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: There are no subtitles on the set but it is close-captioned in English only.

Extras: All 26 episodes feature an audio introduction from Barbara Feldon.
There is also a commentary track by Barbara Feldon and Buck Henry on 99 Loses Control and a commentary track by Don Rickles on The Little Black Book, Part 2.",1428192000,,2476,4.531390134529148

3816050,5,B001UXJGII,"""Get Smart"" was at the peak of its creative powers in its 3rd season--which may rank as the show's funniest year yet. The show features a brand new opening as Agent 86 drives a blue Volkswagen Karmann Ghia--although that car wasn't used in any of the actual episodes as we see Smart sticks with his red convertible.

The 3rd season opens with the great episode ""The Spy Who Met Himself"" in which KAOS has created exact duplicates of all the Control Agents--including an exact doppelganger of Maxwell Smart, all under the fiendish direction of KAOS Vice President Siegfried (the always great Bernie Kopell).

Other standout episodes include ""One of Our Olives Is Missing"", featuring a hilarious guest appearance by Carol Burnett, who refers to Smart as ""puddin"", ""Witness for the Persecution"" and maybe my favorite show of the whole season, ""The Hot Line"", which features a great president LBJ impersonator and works off the very funny premise of Maxwell Smart taking over as ""Chief of Control"" as the real Chief, Thaddeus, gets temporarily busted to ""Agent 2nd class.""

Speaking of the Chief, I noticed he was absent from a number of episodes throughout the season and according to IMDB's notes, Edward Platt suffered from back pain.

Season 3 also lets us in on the secret that Agent 86 lives in fear of the ""Golly Woggles."" Overall, if you love the antics of Maxwell Smart, then Get Smart's third year is sure to please.

The jokes are still funny and the gags are all great.  It makes me laugh every time.  I'm going to get the whole series.

3816113,3,B001UXJGII,"This is a hard review to write Because Im not sure anyone else is going to feel the way I feel  But here goes
Season one and Season two I enjoyed a lot..... But season Three started to get on my nerves.  The jokes got old I just got tired of  ""Sorry About that ,"" also ""And Loving it"" and lets not forget ""Missed it by that much.""  I realize these lines, some might say are part of Maxwell Smarts Charm and maybe it was when you saw the show week to week But bunched up in a DVD Collection, I find it a bit much by this third season.  I think Jokes are only funny if you cant see them coming a mile away
The plus side is There were several episodes of Kaos agent Zigfried.  But another downside you get the last episode of Agent 13 (The agent in the weighing machine or Ice machine of mailbox) who was my favorite sub character. Agent 13 was in only one episode and Barbara Feldon your host said it was his last.

3816116,3,B001UXJGII,"Well,this is now season three of the famous spy-spoof TV show ""Get Smart"" and the laughs continue.
This season is especially noteworthy for two reasons:it's continuing popularity and acceptance into pop culture and,as a result,its' unprecedented(to this point),appearances of guest stars. Here's a list of the celebs I caught sight of:Ceasar Romero,Milton Berle,Bob Hope,Danny Thomas,Ernest Borgnine,Larry Storch,Wally Cox,Joey Bishop,Don Rickles,Shelley Berman,Johnny Carson,Carol Burnett,John Byner,Regis Philbin and Robert Culp. Phew! We certainly know where most of that season's budget went to,don't we? The ep featuring Robert Culp I found an especially funny one as it is a send up Culps'then hit show ""I Spy"".Comedian Stu Gilliam plays Cosby's role against Adam's Culp,with the same type of banter between the two and with the attendant ""I Spy"" theme in the background. To top things off Culp himself suddenly comes on the scene doing a great bit as a Hindu speaking waiter.
Chaos super spy Siegfried(Bernie Kopell) and Control agent/robot(Dick Gautier)are also on hand to keep the laughs rolling.
I found many of the eps,too many in fact,relied too much on the same jokes and routines. The gag that goes something like:Smart:""Don't tell me he has a gun"",Agent 99""Max,he has a gun"",Smart""I told you not to tell me that"" was used ad nauseum in this season and hurt it. I found the eps got funnier and better written as the season wound down. In fact the last ep was written by Leonard Stern(producer)himself. That ep also features for the first time puzzle-piece fade outs and fade-ins.
For the first time we also have in the set.....some extras. Hurray! They finally threw we season-by-season buyers a bone;lucky us. In the eps with Don Rickles(there are two)we have some bloopers that occured between the two actors during filming. It isn't much(about 2 1/2 min's) but it is something.
Technically,while these eps may have been remastered I find there is an annoying element in the quality of the picture. One almost seems to be looking through a very thin veil,a gauze effect if you will. These eps should be clear and crisp. This can be said to be true for the entire series so far. Also,as with other seasons,there are some eps where it seems the sound has been recorded through a tunnel. Not what I would expect from a supposedly ""remastered"" set. One must ask are these remastered from original elements or prints?
Ed Platt(The Chief)and Barbara Feldon(Agent 99) continue to blend together and support their star Don Adams to a tee. Adams for his part continues to be right on the money in his portrayal of his character of the bumbling spy who gets it right in the end,despite himself. Adams also continues to do a subtle Stan Laurel imitation throughout the show,with his head nods and double takes going into a self-satisfied look. Even some of the gags are Laurel derived.
In conclusion Season Three continues its' zany send up of the spy genre,then at the height of its' popularity thanks to Sean Connery in his James Bond role on the big screen. While some of the ""jokes"" get a bit tiresome and over used this season,the show and especially its' actors,continue to play their parts true to the shows core theme. We do get a doggy-bone of an extra thrown our way for the first time but I do have a continuing doubt about that picture quality and sometimes less than stellar sound quality.",1248134400,3,3407,4.958041958041958
