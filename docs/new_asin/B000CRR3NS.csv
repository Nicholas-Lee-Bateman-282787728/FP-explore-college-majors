8101313,5,B000CRR3NS,"This is an amazing collection of National Geographic historical documentaries. National Geographic is a world leader in this type of program so almost anything they produce will be of A+ quality. They are on the same level as BBC or PBS. However, the main reason I'm writing this review is that I actually received a different set than the one pictured above. I purchased directly from Amazon, not a third party seller. It actually isn't a problem for me because the set I received is stellar as well, but you might want to check the UPC before ordering this. To be clear, the set I received is titled ""Explore Your Mind: History"" and the one pictured above is ""Explore Your Mind: History & People."" The main difference is the one I received is focused more on military history, which I enjoy. The ""History & People"" is more focused on historically important individuals and things. I will list the titles of both so you can differentiate.

Explore Your Mind: History (The set I received)
National Geographic's Untold Stories of WWII
National Geographic's The Battle for Midway
National Geographic - Vietnam's Unseen War - Pictures from the Other Side
National Geographic - Pearl Harbor: Legacy of Attack
National Geographic - Lost Subs
Search for Kennedy's Pt 109
National Geographic - Lewis & Clark - Great Journey West
Secrets of the Titanic: Anniversary Edition
National Geographic - Through the Lens

Explore Your Mind: History & People (The product pictured above)
Wrath of the Tsar: Peter the Great
National Geographic - The New World: Nightmare in Jamestown
National Geographic - Napoleon's Final Battle
National Geographic - The Madness of Henry the VIII
King Tut's Final Secrets
Great Inca Rebellion, The
National Geographic: Icons of Power - Empress of Ambition, Catherine the Great
National Geographic: Blackbeard - Terror at Sea
National Geographic - Air Force One

So, these are both great sets and worth picking up. But they ARE different in focus. I can see how they would get confused for one another based on the title alone. If you greatly prefer one over the other, make sure which one is being sent when ordering.",1502323200,,2134,4.9222222222222225
