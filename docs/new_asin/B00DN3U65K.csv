8594651,4,B00DN3U65K,"""Dans La Maison"" (2012 release from France; 108 min.; US title ""In The House"") brings several parallel stories: first we meet 16 yr. old Claude, a high school student at the Lycee Flaubert who, in a class assignment on ""what was my weekend like"", turns in a long story about how he finally was able to get invited by one of his classmates to spend time in their house, which (for reasons not fully explained) Claude had been dreaming about for a long time. Claude's teacher grades the writing assignment a B+ and encourages Claude to keep writing more. The teacher also shares this with his wife, who we later learn runs an art gallery that may be shut down at any time. She too is fascinated by the writings of Claude. A good part of the movie consists of reading/seeing Claude's latest updates on what is going on ""in the house"", and how it affect/may affect the teacher and his wife, as well as the family of Claude's classmate. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie is being billed (in US media anyway) as a ""suspense/thriller"" and while there is a certain element of mystery in the movie, this is NOT a suspense/thriller, even when at a certain point in the movie we do not know anymore whether the writings of Claude are a true reflection of past events, or whether they are a version of events as Claude had hoped they would go. This is a talk-movie and leans towards being a comedy, if anything. Writer-director Franois Ozon does a great job with the pacing of the movie, introducing new elements at the right time to keep us interested in the movie from start to finish. Ernst Umhauer is an up-and-coming talent and just great in the role of Claude, a slightly creepy character (check out the closing scenes of the movie!), but Fabrice Luchini as the teacher and Kirsten Scott Thomas as his wife are equally memorable.

The screening where I first saw this at in 2013 (at the E Street Landmark Theatre in Washington DC) was absolutely packed, and the movie even got an applause from the audience as the closing credit started to roll. This is will you a good indication of the entertainment value of this movie. If you are in the mood for a top notch quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""In The House"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1447718400,,2420,4.5228310502283104
