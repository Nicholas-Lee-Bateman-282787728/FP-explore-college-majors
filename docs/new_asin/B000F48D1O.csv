8117179,3,B000F48D1O,"If you get this DVD you probably did it because you saw some flick from it on youtube with some scantily clad demon chicks. And you get them! However, be aware that it's not much, but what you get is probably worth the 4$ or so that this DVD cost. The main demon chick runs around with one of those bras that look like some skeleton is standing behind her grabbing her juggs and then there is her henchwoman who is a human turned demon and who has that standard American vampire face that all vampires since Buffy have (thank's HBO for not having that carbuncle face on your vampires), BUT on the plus side: She actually looks better with that face than with her regular face. That chick could use a nose job in real life.

Other than the chick factor, this is clearly a B-Movie. The dialogs are wooden and utterly nonsensical, the plot is predictable without having Miss Cleo around (""Headquarters instructs us to work with that new super agent who is arriving here tomorrow. The name is Alex Schminkenfink. You will work with him!"" - And SURPRISE! The Alexandro is actually an Alexis! Who would have thought of that? The last time I saw that coming was in the 1940-something flick ""Them!"". And the rest of the plot is of similar thin consistency.

But then again, if you enjoy that kind of cheesiness, by all means get the disk. For 4$ it is certainly a good laugh and when you and your buddies are full of beer, this disk will come in handy.",1369958400,3,1444,4.404494382022472
8117180,4,B000F48D1O,"Guardian of the Realm was a real surprise.  The acting and directing were uniformly good.  The script was smart, and the plotting was very textured.  I also appreciated the use of old school make-up and costumes to create the demons and other creatures.

Guardian of the Realm posits an Occult Police Force patrolling the U.S. to stop demons from leaking into our ""realm.""  While this concept has been done before--notably Buffy and Torchwood, if you translate demons to aliens, GOR establishes its own mythology with some pretty neat flourishes, such as a clever means of demon disposal.

The story centers on two such Police Officers Josh Griffin and Angela Marlowe, an officer from the New York office.  However, unlike many small budgeted productions that only can afford a handful of actors, this one expands to include a chief of operations, another pair of Demon Hunters and a pair of computer techs, all ably acted.  The cast expands further when Josh and Angela follow the clues to persons of interest.

The plot flows rather seamlessly, and there's genuine character development and as well as an applaudable avoidance of cliche.  Frequently I found myself saying ""That's cool,"" or ""Oh, that's a sneaky twist.""  One reviewer referred to the production as campy, and I disagree with that.  I think this was an earnest attempt to produce something novel.  The humor arises from the characterizations, and the characters are quite enjoyable.  When something bad happens to them, you feel for them.

The only warning I'd issue, and I think it's obvious is that this isn't something for kids.  It's got nudity and gore, which builds to a climax rather than splatters in every scene.",1325548800,3,1687,4.9714285714285715
8117181,4,B000F48D1O,"The cover of the DVD has nothing to do with the film. This movie reminded me of an adult version of Bible man superhero type show. Tanya Dempsey has the acting ability of a porn star, but keeps her skimpy clothes on during the whole movie. Only demons get naked. We do discover that demons live on earth disguised as humans and like a bad Romulan cloaking device, they must reveal themselves prior to attacking. The movie was campy and at times had a ""Japanese Sci-Fi"" flavor to it.

It would be a perfect candidate for an MST-3000 episode.",1277596800,,540,4.454545454545454
8117182,1,B000F48D1O,"Not much plot,
special effects so-so.
Ends with kind of a bang...
Would not buy again.",1228780800,3,86,4.4375
8117183,3,B000F48D1O,"Despite the cover this is not a film about vampires. It's about demons (to me that makes all the difference in the world). In this film there's a secret organisation that picks up on disturbances in the fabric of the universe in LA with a special monitoring system. When a demon comes through to our world, a person's sent over to send them back... by shooting them. Great story! (not!)

A very stupid premise. And in LA I'd think it'd be very hard to tell who's who, from people of this realm from all others.",1153094400,6,510,4.368421052631579
