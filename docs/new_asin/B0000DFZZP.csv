8000810,5,B0000DFZZP,"This Japanese horror film has everything you would want: teenagers getting killed in horrible ways as sacrifices to summon a very powerful demon, a teacher making out with one of her students, a young witch trying to prevent the inevitable, & blood & guts flying everywhere! What's NOT to love about this movie? Kimika Yoshino's first of two portrayals as Misa Kuroi is nothing short of terrific, & she makes us believe that she IS powerful, beyond words with magical forces. Co-starring Mio Takagi, who would later star as Captain Megumi Iruma in 'Ultraman Tiga' the following year this film was released. Highly recommended like its prequel 'Birth of the Wizard'.",1384041600,,665,5.0
8000811,1,B0000DFZZP,"Stale, boring & predictable- it was like any dull American slasher flick.  I've seen hundreds of them & like to watch Asian horror for the unpredictability, the plots & originality.  This film was a disappointment.",1369353600,,214,5.085714285714285
8000812,4,B0000DFZZP,"Misa Kuroi is a girl with problems.  First off, she is the new girl, recently transfered and finding herself plagued by rumors. Secondly, the rumors are true.  She is secretly a powerful witch, the most recent in a long line of witch-girls to inherit the power.  (""Eko Eko Azarak"" is her chant to summon her mystic powers.)  Thirdly, someone else in her school is summoning Lucifer and sacrificing her classmates so that she may be crowned empress of the universe.  Not a good start for the poor girl.

If it all sounds a bit like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" well, it is, although the comic series that ""Eko Eko Azarak"" is based on predates ""Buffy"" by about 20 years.  No matter who influenced who, the basic premise is familiar, and comparisons can be made.  But ""Eko Eko Azarak"" is no hip, slick-talking teenage drama.  The violence is gory and the sex is explicit, and the students of this high school do more  screaming and dying than worrying about fashion.

The basic premise of this first film in the series (followed by two more, as well as a television series) has 12 students being held after class to take a test.  There is some funny business going on, and the teacher is having a lesbian affair with one of the students.  At some point in the evening, the students realize that they cannot leave the school, and the windows can't be broken.  On top of this, the number ""12"" appears on the  blackboard, and begins to magically count-down as the students begin to die.  Begin the panic.

Of course, Misa Kuroi manifests her hidden magic for a showdown with the mysterious villain.  An effects-laden battle of will and powers is the only end for this dark path.  But how many students will survive, and how close will the evil witch come to summoning Lucifer?

Overall, this is a fun flick and a solid horror/magic film.  The lesbian affair is very sexy, and Kimika Yoshino as Misa Kuroi is a good actress.  After all, you can't go wrong with a film whose tagline is ""Come, darkness and vicious spirits. Lucifer, let this cute girl be the empress of the universe""",1111536000,6,2073,4.576086956521739
8000813,3,B0000DFZZP,"Of the only two Japanese horror films I've seen, Eko Eko Azaraku (Wizard of Darkness) and Ringu, I enjoyed Wizard of Darkness far more. I didn't find myself watching the clock as I did with Ringu and it seemed to be just the right length for this type of movie.

Kimika Yoshino did a fine job in the leading role and is a fine actress. She grew on me more as I got further into the movie. Ryka Yuzuki was another actress I enjoyed watching, as she was probably the best looking female in the movie. She didn't have a very big part but the part she had was fine with me.

Overall, no one stood out as a bad actor or actress, which is rare, but it was in Japanese so what do I know? I looked all right from my perspective.

And finally, the plot wasn't too terribly original, but the movie did have it's own unique feel to it. I really couldn't find much wrong with the movie as a whole.  3/5 stars",1106352000,2,896,4.073863636363637
8000814,5,B0000DFZZP,"I really didn't know what to expect from this movie. Japanese horror flix can sometimes turn into gore and bore type movies without much substance. This one, however was a very nice surprise. Very sexy, exciting, and scary. I highly reccomend it.",1098835200,5,246,4.880952380952381
