4007063,5,B002WJ99W2,"Linda Darnell and Tab Hunter play two survivors of a ship that sinks in the ocean and wind up on a deserted island together.

Linda Darnell is beautiful,as usual, in this movie and it was Tab Hundter's first movie and he does very well.  Acting of all of the three main characters is very well played and the scenes of love between Linda & Tab and the subsequent triangle when a downed pilot lands on the island, are all done tastefully unlike today's movies.

The resolution and color are beautiful and the sound is very good too.  It is a nice wholesome movie and can be watched by the entire family and it has a nice ending.

The only thing in the movie that I questioned was Tab Hunter's character's ability to build so many huts in so little time and Linda making beautiful outfits, one dyed red, from a loon and threads made from within the bark of some native plants.  But, it isn't distracting and makes for a nice story.

I highly recommend the purchase of this movie. It is certainly worth the cost which is not expensive.

I received the disk well packaged and in a short period after ordering it.  I am glad that this movie was so greatly copied on to a dvd.  I am in my sixties and had never seen it before even though, when I was young, my parents, who were movie buffs, took my sisters and me to most movies that played in the late forties & fifties  until we were old enough to go on our own.

Buy it if you liked the late  Linda Darnell or like Tab Hunter and you won't be sorry.  It is a nice relaxing movie that is not dull or boring and moves along at a nice pace.",1267920000,13,1584,4.167763157894737

4007065,3,B002WJ99W2,"VCI Entertainment presents ""ISLAND OF DESIRE (aka: Saturday Island)"" (4 August 1952) (93 min/Color) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Good print and quality sound with breathtaking outdoor locations with this unusual plot and story --- Linda Darnell playing a Canadian Nurse, beautiful and sexy as ever --- Tab Hunter playing a US Marine who is stranded with Darnell during wartime on a Desert Island and love is in the air --- Donald Gray is shot down and enters the picture while Darnell tries to save him, while falling in love with him and throwing over Hunter for Gray --- Gray's acting gives the film more substance than it would have without him --- The film still holds up well and the cinematography is another character in the film --- Highly recommend this to one to all, especially when it was released in the early '50s, when the league of decency's was thriving and Darnell is very skimpy in her wardrobe.

4007066,3,B002WJ99W2,"Seen this movie once and the picture quality was just horrible. I'm sure this DVD release has been cleaned up,and will have a good quality picture. Linda Darnell is stunning in this movie. I hope more of her films find a home on DVD. This lovely lady deserves to be remembered.",1262649600,6,277,4.450980392156863
4007067,3,B002WJ99W2,Tab Hunter is really good looking but has a high piping voice which doesn't go over well.  He gets a crush on an older women while they are stranded. It's a little boring.,1420588800,,171,4.181818181818182
4007068,3,B002WJ99W2,"Bad acting...storyline or editing so bad I was confused as to what was happening in the character development...like I didn't realise that tab hunter was being tortured inside by his love for Linda Darnell...so I didn't know why he had made a raft and when he had the time.

Other than that...I liked the overall story of the movie. This should be redone with some seasoned actors and it would make a great movie. I have an original movie still from this film and I had always wanted to see the movie... tab hunter sure is cute and I enjoyed the location and Linda Darnell's unusual mature look and the loyalty her character had in the end...",1417046400,3,642,4.487179487179487

4007072,3,B002WJ99W2,"I bought this movie specifically because I recall fondly my total crush on Tab Hunter when I was a teen. I had not seen it since then and came across it accidentally. The story is lame, the acting kind of campy, but the scenery is gorgeous and so are the stars! It was one of Tab's first movies and it wasn't his fault the dialogue was so corny, but he later became a very decent actor. So the movie may not be a Hollywood classic, but Tab Hunter is a true classic!!!",1380672000,,467,4.086956521739131
4007073,5,B002WJ99W2,"Yes, it is nostalgia....great old movie.  While Linda Darnell was a well established Hollywood personality, it was new comer Tab Hunter who has been a favorite for generations.",1380672000,,176,5.285714285714286
4007074,5,B002WJ99W2,"Loved this film with it's visions of palm trees, beautiful blue ocean, Linda Darnell and Tab Hunter.  while I am well aware of the ratings on this film, I never let that bother me.  My personal rating is AAAA+ simply based on its beauty, good enough story line and kind of film that makes me ""remember when"" has some fine fine memories.;  Linda and a very young Tab are easy on the eyes actors.  Glad to be able to add to my DVD collection.",1365120000,2,440,4.2023809523809526
4007075,5,B002WJ99W2,"I have read about Tab Hunter's first feature film. I assume it is in the public domain and the DVD I purchased needed to be restored. I guess because of the terrible acting, they didn't want to spend money cleaning it up? A few scenes the words are scrambled. From a small company that puts public domain features on DVD.",1303776000,,321,4.366666666666666
4007076,5,B002WJ99W2,"As a child when seeing this 'desert island' film on B&W TV, I could only dream of having that experience, myself.  I've waited many years for the current grade A DVD transfer, and it is finally here, thanks to KIT-PARKER-FILMS and VCI Entertainment distributor.  Linda Darnell was a beautiful TX gal, and having met her sister, Undine, I mentioned this film as a favorite.  Ron Davis wrote a terrific biography of Linda, a most desireable woman who wouldn't play the Hollywood casting couch game, so her career was made to suffer.  She still triumphed over the studio heads showing her grit before her tragic end as a fire victim.  As for Tab Hunter, a dreamboat blond Adonis of that or any era, who went on to become a mature and handsome man with much improved acting skills well-exhibited soon after in ""Battle Cry"" and a few years later in ""Damn Yankees"" is the perfect protagonist for this, his first film.  Mr. Hunter (his Studio name), whom I met in Hollywood, remains a classy gentleman who learned and got much out of life, as displayed in his autobiography.  He is perhaps one of the most genuine people Hollywood ever produced.  The new transfer reveals a beautifull Technicolor film, though a more innocent Hollywood product than the overstuffed, overproduced, pretentious fantasy film products of today.  Perhaps that, along with it's stars, recommends the film more than anything else.  Donald Gray, the one-armed actor who played Mark Saber, P.I. on British TV, plays a downed pilot on this ""Island of Desire"" aka ""Saturday Island"" who creates the third party in this eternal love triangle.  I thank David Rose for producing, Stuart Heisler for directing and Stephanie Nordli for scripting the original film.",1278633600,9,1723,4.927335640138408

8383163,5,B002WJ99W2,"Island Of Desire was released in 1952. It starred Tab Hunter, in his first big role, and Linda Darnell. A fun film of life on a small island. Fans of the cast will like this the most.",1468195200,,183,3.972972972972973
8383164,3,B002WJ99W2,"Finally got to see this hard to find film. Color and (on location) tropical setting was a big plus. The actors were excellent, especially the beautiful Linda Darnell. A young Tab Hunter was good also, considering this was his first film. An enjoyable film, well worth the price!",1461715200,,278,4.8125
8383165,5,B002WJ99W2,You have to have a big imagination to go along with the plot. I got it because im a big Linda Darnell fan and this was one of her movies i still didn't have. I was pleasantly surprised i quite enjoyed this movie. Although i think she Made the wrong choice in the end.,1455321600,,267,3.962962962962963
8383166,4,B002WJ99W2,"Shipwrecked on an uninhabited South Seas atoll, a Canadian nurse (Linda Darnell) and a young Marine (Tab Hunter) initially clash, but as the weeks turn into months, begin to see each other through different eyes and give in to their natural impulses. But when an RAF flyer (Donald Gray) crashes on the island, the tropical love story is complicated by that familiar bit of romantic geometry, the Eternal Triangle. Made in 1952, let me first say, what a handsome man Tab was. Linda was pretty gorgeous too. I loved the story and I loved how Tab was so much younger and Linda some older. The scenery was gorgeous, too. Why 4 stars and not 5. Well, 2 things really, no one would take Donald Gray over Tab Hunter! Ever! The second, Tab seems to be able to build anything from bamboo, we had a fully furnished home, plates, tables, chairs, you name it! Really!",1449705600,5,855,4.558441558441558

8383169,4,B002WJ99W2,"This movie brought back memories of when films were more innocent in their presentation.
For its day this movie was probably considered risqu, but in today's world...not so much.
Tab Hunter's sexual orientation was kept quiet back then.  Linda Darnell's  classy style and beauty
were a joy and together they pulled the plot off.  It was a feel good- and glad I watched it - film.
Just a little outdated technically.",1446940800,,415,4.816901408450704

Linda Darnell was gorgeous, as always.",1433203200,,109,5.352941176470588
8383171,2,B002WJ99W2,"I wanted this to be a guilty pleasure of a kind of desert island fantasy they don't make anymore, but the film quality is poor. The reviews led me to believe this was a better print than it is. Pretty blurry. The movie itself isn't really the problem; doubtful  most purchasers would have exalted cinematic expectations of this older woman/ young sailor  stranded-on- an-atoll potboiler. I just wanted it to be in glorious Technicolor.",1428278400,2,435,4.864864864864865
