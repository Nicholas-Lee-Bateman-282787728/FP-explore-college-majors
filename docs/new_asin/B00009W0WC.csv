1891846,5,B00009W0WC,"This movie is a childhood favorite, I love this movie, the music, and that it's a little funny at times. But overall this movie had scared the crap out of a few younger siblings of mine. Lol I love it!",1393632000,,201,4.05
1891847,5,B00009W0WC,This movie was really funny in a scary way. I loved the main character Kwame (Russell Richardson). Where can I find more movies with the above said actor? He is awesome and so handsome.,1390435200,,185,4.470588235294118
1891848,4,B00009W0WC,"This movie is really good, especially if you like the Full Moon line of movies.
I would recommend this movie to those who like other Full Moon movies and have not seen this yet",1366329600,3,176,4.205882352941177
1891849,4,B00009W0WC,"As far as killer toy/doll/puppet movies go, this one is a classic. The story is a mix of Pumpkinhead style voodoo revenge mixed with Leprechaun in the Hood. If you're a fan of Full Moon styled goofiness, you'll love it.",1361750400,2,219,4.5
1891850,5,B00009W0WC,I loved this movie.  A great cast of actors...who deliver their lines well.  It's scary...and the plot is a good one.  Freda Payne...yes...the singer...has a neat role in the movie.,1357948800,2,181,4.966666666666667
1891851,5,B00009W0WC,"RAGDOLL is a good movie and the ""RAGDOLL"" is verry terrifing ! ""MAGIC OF THE KILLING KING"" (Watch trailer).",1208217600,2,107,4.684210526315789
1891852,3,B00009W0WC,"C'mon, now, Full Moon Pictures...if you wanted to cast the role of a priestess of voodoo/black magic, Freda Payne didn't do the job here. She's such a great songstress to feature in this 2-bit role. In fact, at times I sensed she sang her lines, rather than spoke them! While the movie had it's high points, it was more comical than scary. More like a '90s version of Blacula! Hmmm...also who's the ruff-n-tuff guy who goes in-and-out of personalities ranging from Little Richard to Mike Tyson! What a riot!! The ragdoll puppet would have been more effective if special effects were geared to body movements, rather than motion-gliding through her slash scenes. The kids can stay up and watch this one...just tell them the blood is grape jelly!! Great soundtrack from some unknowns, too!!",1012780800,2,788,4.888059701492537

1891855,4,B00009W0WC,"Ragdoll is one of the most chilling, exciting movies I've ever seen!  The story is about a kid (Quama) who accidently ""conjures up the magic of the killin' kind"" when, with the help of Shadow Man, he brings a (rag)doll to life. He summons the ragdoll to kill an evil music company boss who wants his music group to sign a contract.  But, something goes wrong when Quama tells Shadow Man he can have anything he wants. . . .what Quama doesn't know is that every person Ragdoll kills that Quama wants dead, it also kills one of his FRIENDS!!  Watch and see what happens in this fun, amazing film.  Well casted and well played, great peice of work!",1005177600,3,645,4.394957983193278
