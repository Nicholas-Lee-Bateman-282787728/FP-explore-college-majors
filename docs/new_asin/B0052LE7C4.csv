4530112,5,B0052LE7C4,"Emelio Derbez is just the most versatile actor.  I have seen him on Novelas and thought highly of him on those as well.  But this is just the best, chick flick, I have seen in a long time.  If you don't ""do"" my language, no fear there are English subtitles.  It looses in the translation, to me, but still...great movie.  Funny, romantic, just all around great..Gracias Derbez",1410307200,2,376,4.552238805970149

4530114,5,B0052LE7C4,"Well, this movie is awesome. Eugenio Derbez at his best. I love his comedy. I guess some people are just funny and can make a very bad breakup funny. Not everyone can make a horrible breakup funny and Eugenio does this like is natural to him. One of my favorite comedians of all time. Highly recommend.",1406419200,,302,4.410714285714286

4530117,5,B0052LE7C4,"Well at the beginning it's your classic romance then it's broken heart but at the end the movie sends you a message on how people can change. Funny, drama I like it :)",1349568000,3,167,4.090909090909091
4530118,4,B0052LE7C4,"""No Eres Tu, Soy Oy"" (It's Not You, It's Me) (100 min.; 2010 release from Mexico) brings the story of Javier, played by Eugenio Derbez, who has been living for the last 3 years with his girlfriend Maria (played by Alejandra Barros). Javier's career as a surgeon is not going so well, and Maria suggest that they get married and move to Miami to take a fresh start. Shrtly after geting married, Maria leaves for Miami a week before Javier to get things ready, and then a week later, as Javier is driving to the airport, she calls him to tell him that she has left him for another man. Javier is crushed and begins a long pertiod of self-pity, while eventually trying to find his legs and again.

When Maria leaves Javier, we are only 20 min. into the movie, and while I don't want to give any further plot away (you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out), you can only imagine how most of the remaining 80 min. of the movie is filled with funny situations where Javier moves back in with his parents, goes on dates, etc. etc. It is easy to see why Eugenio Derbez is such a huge star in Mexico, as he oozes charm throughout the movie. Also a special mention for Martina Garcia, who plays the role of Julia, one of the new flames in Javier's life.

In all, this is quite a light-hearted rom-com, done Mexican style. It's perfect for when you just want some mindless entertainment that has just the right touch. I found myself enjoying this more and more as the movie went along.",1330992000,8,1486,4.341726618705036
4530119,3,B0052LE7C4,"During its 7th edition, for the very first time, the Beloit International Film Festival dedicated an entire day to show Spanish-speaking films. They included productions from Mexico, Spain, and Peru.
Living in a city where the closest place to watch international independent films is more than an hour away, is always gratifying and refreshing to see this kind of events around the area. Different venues were established at Beloit and its surroundings too, such as Janesville, Wisconsin and Rockford, Illinois. During four days, the work of filmmakers from around the world started on this February 16th showing different film's genre.
Despite the title of the movie being a clich: ""It's Not You, It's Me"", (""No eres t, soy yo""), it is interesting to see a Mexican production that is not about illegal immigrants, drug cartels, corruption, and neither about kidnappings. Finally, it had arrived, a romantic comedy just like the ones Hollywood produces, which its main purpose is to have fun, laugh, and relax.
The story is about Javier, a surgeon from Mexico City, and how his entire world crumbles when his wife of just one week, calls him from Miami (where they had planned to live) to break-up with him, quoting the famous break-up line: ""It's Not You, It's Me"".  Due to other adversities as a result of his depression and clumsiness, Javier has to not only to deal with his feelings of emptiness, but also with not having a job, and neither a place to live. He has to start from zero. Meanwhile he finds support from a Psychiatrist, family, friends, and a new doggie, which will be a link between Javier and his new possible love, Julia. Later, he has to take a decision when Maria comes back from Miami and asks Javier for forgiveness.
This romantic comedy makes you laugh along Javier's suffering and will entertain you easily. It shows the typical Mexico City middle class style of life. Eugenio Derbez (Javier) is very credible in his role; he is funny but never exaggerated. However, there are times where the story gets stuck in Javier's struggling situation. Dialogues consist in doing the same acid jokes and the self-question: ""Why I have been dumped?""
Javier's character starts to get to the nerve, just as he did to his Psychiatrist in the story, who gets very desperate and sick of Javier's self-compassion, to the point that he just yells at him: ""Ok, so kill yourself!""
The story has predictable situations, such as the wedding picture scene, where Maria is distracted by something, or better said, by someone. When Julia first appears in scene, it can be predicted she will impact Javier's life, too. But maybe, that's why this movie is an easy one, and is not a pretender. As Kevin Thomas from Los Angeles Times said: ""It has a much lighter, breezier touch than most of its Hollywood counterparts; it's sexy without being crass, easy and relaxed rather than slick"".
Acting is well developed by all casting, which is not a surprise since they are very recognized actors in Mexico and hold solid acting careers over there. Just Like Eugenio Derbez (Javier) who was called ""The Mexican Jim Carrey"" during an interview at the Fox L.A studio.
  This film has English subtitles and translation is well applied. It doesn't lose the funny in the jokes due to Mexican sayings or slangs. It uses the typical average Spanish language and slang from Mexico City, but doesn't abuse of it, making it easy to understand to other Spanish speakers who are not from Mexico. This is something that doesn't happen in its original Argentinian version, (2004) which was full of swearing and slang.
""It's Not You, It's Me"" sold 18.4 million pesos at the third day of being released on August, 2010, which make it ranks the 4th place within the romantic comedies in Mexico. It scored higher than the last movie Eugenio has participated in (Under the Same Moon, 2007), and above very successful Mexican movies as (Amores Perros, 2000), which are more developed and mature than this one, highlighting Eugenio Derbez interpretation and popularity, as well as, the good marketing strategy behind the film.
""It's Not You, It's Me"" was released last year in the United States, but only in few states, overall to target Hispanic viewers, that's why is so delightful to see it at the Beloit International Film Festival. Not only, with the mission to target Spanish speakers audience, but a more opened public.
This movie is predictable, but the producer accomplishes his objective: to entertain. It wasn't meant to reinvent the wheel. There is no a complex formula, neither is deep, nor life changing. It is just as simple as the very same title of the movie, a clich. It is expected because it has been many times used, it is borrowed, but universal. That's why I rank it as a 3 star movie. People, who are looking for a light movie to watch, rent the DVD, which is already at Netflix and Redbox. Definitely you'll open your perspective to other productions that are not only from Hollywood. And next year, for the 8th edition of the Beloit International Film Festival look forward to see at least one foreign movie. It opens your knowledge and helps to impact positively the community.
