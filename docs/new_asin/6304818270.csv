927759,2,6304818270,"The plot involves something about astronaut Dean Fredericks landing on an asteroid where he's shrunk down to miniature size by a race of miniature  people who ...  Oh, forget it. This minor curiosity from the early 60's  combines the schlocky production values of Grade-Z sci-fi films from the  50's with a bit of the campy excess found in the Saturday-matinee serials  of the 1930's. The result is watchable but not especially fun.
Dean  Fredericks (better known for his short-lived ""Steve Canyon""  series on TV) is stiff and humorless as the astronaut but he has the right  looks and he gets the opportunity to do an extended bare-chest scene. (If  you can't act, flex.)

  The 'planet has a very high gravitational field yet is not shaped even remotely spherically. Breathing the air on this planet shrinks down the Earth man to less than 1/100th of his normal size, with no physiological damage, while breathing Earth air from his spacesuit returns him to normal size. Where is the missing mass? Does his density simply vary by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude? This makes no sense.
  Newton's Laws of Motion have been known since the 17th century. Apparently, the film makers missed every science class in every grade at the schools they attended before making this movie. The rocket ships are shown changing direction in space as though they were cars driving on a highway on Earth. ( Yes, I saw the little flame at the tail of the spaceship angling away like a vectored thrust on a modern warplane, but this would only have the effect of causing the ship to go into a spin with no change in overall direction).

928213,3,6304818270,"Well, it was an interesting watch.  I love these old SF movies mainly for their usually amusing look into the future.  This movie was technically not so far off with their portrayal of Earth's adventures into space (space suits, spaceship design, etc.), but the alien side of it was pretty sketchy. The portrayal of an advanced civilisation of (at least to my reconning) cave men and women warring with another alien race of (possibly) insect origin with weapons far beyond our comprehension of science, seeming more like magic, actually... well OK, why not?  The acting was pretty stiff, and some of the plot lines thrown out there just for the heck of it (a love triangle?) but I did like the morality of the characters involved when push came to shove.  The shrinking aspect of the plot seemed more of an afterthought thrown into the mix than anything else.  Still, the video and audio quality were good (for the color version; I didn't check the B&W version), so for you fans of off-beat, unintentionally funny older SF, you may find this one worth viewing; and then again, you may find it a waste.

Thin plot, thinner direction, nothing resembling acting. 100s of movies like this were turned out in the 1950-1960s. There was audience demand, most similar movies made money, but only because the production budgets were so small and there was no advertising budget. These movies survived on revenues from weekend matinees, drive-in showings, and showings on TV, usually late at night on Friday or Saturday nights on local channel programs featuring ""scary"" movies and/or ""space"" movies. Color movies were the industry standard in the 1950s, so black & white ""scary"" or ""space"" movies were a sure sign of minimal production budgets - though there were small numbers of ""legitimate"" movies in B&W in the 1950s and 1960s. Phantom Planet is a surprisingly ""average"" representative of its genre, not the cheesiest, but not with high aspirations either. If you go into this knowing the movie's ""place"" in the history of cinema, it's interesting as an example. This kind of movie was all my friends and I talked about watching and wanting to see when I was ages 8-15 (late 1950s-mid-1960s).

DVD

I wish all my favorite 1950s B-movies were re-released this well. The Legend Films DVD is very good in quality compared to the DVDs I have found for some of my other old favorites.

Both the original B&W and the colorized version are on the DVD. The colorization was done very well.

Menu selections are sparsely: Play color version, Play B&W version, Scene selections (12 chapters color version only), and trailers for other Legend Films DVDs. No language or caption choices.

As a DVD product, I would compare this favorably against the Legend Films DVD of the double-feature ""Giant Gila Monster"" and ""The Killer Shrews"" both color and B&W and even lower budget 1959 movies (saw those at the Rialto Theatre with my mom at the age of 11).

Movie

The movie itself is not one of my favorites, but it does appear to recycle the spaceships from the old TV series Men into Space (or Men in Space) of which I have fond but vague memories. The reason I bought the DVD when I found it in the bin at Big Lots was that I had read the coverage of the film by Forrest J Ackerman (I believe in Spacemen magazine) when it was originally released 1961-1962 (from the stills I thought it was on the order of ""Fire Maidens of Outer Space"" cheesy junk). Good, bad, indifferent, I had to finally see it fifty years after missing it.

Others have done more detailed reviews. A two man spaceship explodes on encountering a mysterious wandering asteroid that resembles a chunky granola clump. Then the titles. Our intrepid hero and an expendable partner are sent out in their two man spaceship to investigate the phantom planet. A meteorite damages the ship, the crew goes out to repair apparently walking with magnetic boots, meteorites sever the hero's air supply, the partner sacrifices himself pushing him into the ship and closing the hatch. Eventually the hero awakens on the phantom planet Rheton shrunk to the size of the Lilliputian Rhetonians by contact with the atmosphere. Turns out the planet is controlled and propelled like a rocket by the inhabitants under leadership of Francis X Bushman. They are in a war with Solarites, critters with sad hang dog expressions. Rhetonians also regard earthlings with suspicion. Our hero must prove himself in trial by combat, there are romantic conflicts, a Solarite POW escapes captivity as other Solarites rain firebombs on Rheton. Overall a bit more interesting than ""Queen of Outer Space"".",1391644800,2,2670,4.749460043196544

928347,2,6304818270,"THE PHANTOM PLANET is a cinematic lowlight of that vintage year of 1961. PP reeks of ineptitude, from a creaky script and crap acting to laughable factual and visual errors. Here, monkey wrench-armed men somehow walk on a spaceship's wing in zero-gravity outer space. This same craft lands belly-down despite a sideward rocket thrust. And no, you're not seeing things-- that man actually DID check the time on his 'phantom' wristwatch (it must be half-past arm hair).

SYNOPSIS--

While between suns this gadabout orb somehow maintains an atmosphere that supports Lilliputian-sized aliens, plus nasty monsters. When an extraterrestrial expedition vanishes, two men are sent to investigate.

Story line and plot, Astronauts Frank Chapman (Dean Fredericks) and Ray Makonnen (Richard Weber) are sent out from Lunar Base 1 to determine what's happened to a couple of ships that simply disappeared in outer space --- A meteor storm damages their propulsion system, and while making repairs, Chapman is knocked unconscious by a stray light flash --- With the Pegasus IV captured by a gravity ray, the ship is brought down to the living planet Raton, where miniature people marvel at the gigantic newcomer --- Will Captain Chapman shrink down to their size, as a result of the planet's atmosphere.

Of course the newcomer is tested by his captors, put on trial for ""harming"" one of them, and is punished by allowing him freedom on Raton with his choice of two beautiful women (Colleen Gray and Dolores Faith) --- Our hero Chapman is no Captain Kirk, and he can't be moved by the wiles of his female companions, all the while trying to figure out how to get back home ---  In the mean time, he must battle a jealous Ratonian in hand to hand combat, and team up with him to defeat the threat of an evil Solarite (Richard Kiel in a wild alien costume) --- Kiel who was ""Jaws"" in the James Bond film series.

928485,5,6304818270,"Why is it that our portrayals of the future always end up looking quaintly dated, if not ugly, when that future comes?  Look to any space-age building built in the `60s.  Or, better yet, look to any space-age built made in the `60s.

1961's Phantom Planet is typical of what we today consider the B-movie genre.  All the necessary elements are there: a ridiculous story, equally bad acting and even worse special effects.  If you don't believe me, I implore you to seek out the film's trailer somewhere online.  I dare you suggest that the mysterious ""phantom planet"" isn't actually a lump of coral.  You'll gasp in horror at the sight of the plastic rock-men.  I know you will, because that's precisely what happened to me.

Any fan of the show Mystery Science Theater 3000 knows what to expect from Phantom Planet, this is precisely the type of thing that Mike and the robots would've delighted over.  But in fact, the nightmarishly bad production values of the film speak for themselves, and are hilarious without any further intervention necessary.

As is the standard with Legend Films releases, this DVD includes, as advertised, both the newly colorized version of the film, as well as the untouched black and white.  Either you like color or you don't (I'd recommend the color in this case--I feel that it heightens immersion), but at least this set provides you with the option either way, which is more that can be said for some of the other versions floating around.",1227571200,4,1476,4.767716535433071
928486,5,6304818270,"Everything a 50's B movie should be.  Monsters, space ships, bizarro plot, an overall strange and trippy throughout, unintended notes of surrealism, tough talkin' 50's B-movie hero types.  So much fun, so much old school trippy craziness - just campy enough. These movies can never be replicated.  Like vintage wines, they have to ""ferment"" for a number of decades to reach the peak of their entertainment value. I savored this one, which I somehow missed on UHF TV growing up.  It's new old stock!  Yeah! What makes this one especially great is that - while not a high-budget production, it wasn't so poverty stricken that it detracted.  To the contrary, this one had some surprisingly competent and effective pre-CGI special effects, decent acting and acceptable production values. A great time at the movies for those who appreciate this vintage.  A five star wine of a B film that has reached maturity.",1222128000,5,906,4.960264900662252
928487,3,6304818270,"I watched this with my son (9), who enjoyed the story and laughed at the clunky special effects.  He dutifully listened to my stories about seeing it and similar films - he is at the age where he accepts my reminiscences instead of rolling his eyes like his sister does at 13 - and we talked about the space age, etc.

I quite enjoyed this for what it made me remember.  But, as with my son, for other viewers it is only of passing interest, like background TV.  Thus, I think it is headed for oblivion or of interest only for film historians once those who watched it as kids are no longer around.

The story has a nice sense of possibility, like we all felt during the space race and which is rather humdrum today.  The hero, while not very charismatic, is open-minded and a lonely explorer, hence his vulnerability to the charms of the mute girl.  He encounters an advanced civilization that has chosen a primitive lifestyle, on a planet fleeing strange enemies and with an unimaginable technology manipulated by what looks like broken wine glasses.  He even makes friends from a natural enemy.  Then, restored to his colleagues, he wonders if it was all a dream.  It ends on a hopeful note for exploration.  I liked it then and still do now.

928528,3,6304818270,"This movie is has its moments.  Some aspects are interesting to watch.  Others are not.  The movie falls just short of the mark to be classic.  The movie is also just good enough to keep it out of the garbage category.  Viewers who enjoy classic science fiction movies of the 40s and 50s may appreciate the better qualities of this movie.

Space ships keep disappearing.  A viewer gets to learn that the reason for the disappearances is an asteroid populated by people who have the technology to keep the asteroid invisible.  At the beginning of the movie we see a space ship which is being accelerated at 11 g's.  Though the ship is accelerating at 11 g's, the men on board have little problem moving and are awake and alert.  The technology of the future is amazing.  Today, pilots pass out somewhere around 8 or 9 g's, and movement is very difficult.

On the other hand, the cockpit of the space ship was outstanding.  Some of the instruments made little sense, but the controls were nicely arranged, and a number of features made this cockpit above average for science fiction movies of the late 50s and early 60s.

A short time later the two crewmen on the space ship are walking about on the exterior of the ship without restraints.  It appears that the men are pulled toward this ship as though there was gravity toward the ship.  The men's shoes looked a lot like street shoes.

Captain Frank Chapman (Dean Fredericks) survives the crash of his ship on the mysterious asteroid.  Chapman stumbles from his ship and swears he sees little people about the size of those in Lilliput.  After opening his helmet, Chapman too shrinks to the size of the little people, which has something to do with the atmosphere of the asteroid and the fields surrounding the asteroid.  We later discover that the name of the asteroid is Rayton.

The little people speak English because all languages on Rayton are translated through voice tone waves, or something like that.  I love scientific gobbledygook double-speak.  We need the English because Chapman is suddenly part of some kind of love quadrangle.  Liara (Coleen Gray) is the hot blonde babe who is a social climber.  Zetha (Delores Faith) is a beautiful mute babe who is shy and has a major crush on Chapman.  Exposure to an enemy Solarite warrior caused Zetha to become mute.  The other guy in this is Herron (Anthony Dexter), who loves Liara, though she is fickle.

After some fighting and the usual male bonding, Chapman and Herron become great friends.  The people of Rayton realize that Chapman is an all right guy, so they decide, after a huge fight with the Solarites involving lots of hand movements over lighted plastic (which controlled their fields and weapons) that it is time for Chapman to go home.  But wait, a critical fight scene with a captured Solarite has to happen.  I actually felt sorry for the Solarite, who was played by Richard Kiel.  The costume apparently had poor visibility because Kiel had a hard time walking down stairs or moving in general.  By coincidence, I also just reviewed ""Eegah,"" yet another Kiel movie that Kiel would probably like to forget.  At least in this movie you could not see his face.

Eventually Chapman is repatriated and the movie ends, but not before the most awful audio effects I have ever heard in a movie.  Many movies use an echo effect or reverberation effect for the narrator.  In this case, the narrator literally repeated the same lines over and over, with the volume reduced each time.  The ending was like an Ed Wood moment for this film.

This movie has too much hokum to qualify as a classic.  However, it still has its moments and I recommend it to people who like science fiction movies of the 50s.  Just be sure to keep your expectations low.  If you believe there were only six good science fiction movies made in the entire 1950s, I can guarantee you that this movie was not one of them.  Good luck!",1142726400,4,3922,4.647743813682679
928529,3,6304818270,"Well there's really nothing much to say about this flick. It's a classic, late atomic age sci-fi space adventure that our parents probably went to see at the drive-in while they were dating. This movie had a lot of potential to be a `so bad it's good' movie, but it's just a forgettable piece of celluloid that's been all but forgotten except for us few fans who live for these kooky old movies.

Space explorers end up missing when they enter a particular section of space. So in steps our gallant hero. He's a tall blond due who does a few scenes without his shirt (typical for these films). There's also a lot of sci-fi gibberish that's also a norm for these films.

Well here's the plot. Our hero crash lands on an asteroid planet where he is immediately shrunken to the size of a bug. This is easily explained by the planet's inhabitants. The strong magnetic force of the planet makes everything small. OK then.

Well we have a fight scene between a jealous suitor and our hero. It seems the love interest is a mute girl who I know I've seen before in other movies and the ruler's daughter. The fight is comic relief at best. The two men must use a brace to push each other onto gravity pads. If you step on the pad the magnetic pull is so great you will disintegrate. (Like I said Sci-Fi gibberish at it's best. The whole movie talks about high magnetism).

Well the finale is the attack from the space aliens. They fly on space ships resembling flaming arrows on strings. Of course the director's probably forgot that since there is no oxygen in space, there cannot be fire, but who's keeping track of this stuff? It is reveiled to us , the fortunate viewer, that an alien had been captured from a past battle. He is being held prisoner. How you ask? I'll let you guess. Yes that's right. He's being held in a cell consisting of a highly magnetized force field. Our Ed Wood moment comes when the power goes out and our alien friend escapes. Check out how he walks down the stairs. The actor obviously could not see where he was going and needs to reassure his footing with each step.

Well the aliens are defeated, and our hero is rescued by yet another rescue party. The final scene is our heart broken hero who has nothing to remember his love interest but a small pebble.

Folks this is definitely not Cat Women of the Moon.",1141603200,2,2334,4.403712296983759
928530,3,6304818270,"Capt. Chapman (Dean Fredericks) lands on an asteriod which is unexpectedly inhabited by six-inch tall humans.  When the atmospheric properties reduce him to their size he not only finds himself working to save their civilization but ensnared in several romantic complications and rivalries as well.  While it sounds slight, the plot is actually cohesive and many of the concepts involved are unexpectedly ambitious--but as it happens, the 1961 PHANTOM PLANET has a less-than-B-movie budget, and the result is a film that alternates between being interesting in terms of ideas and often hilariously bad in execution.

Some of the special effects are pretty good for 1961, but then again some of them are ludicrous beyond belief.  The space sequences are reasonably done until the asteroid appears on screen; depending on how you look at the thing, it might be a clump of trail mix or a deep-fried chicken nugget.  The sets and costumes are adequate until the monster of the piece appears on the scene; even by ""B"" movie standards it is pretty silly stuff.  And then there is the cast.

The most interesting of the actors is Francis X. Bushman, one of the great stars of the silent era and perhaps best recalled as Messala in the 1925 version of BEN-HUR--a film in which he gave a noticeably stagey performance.  By 1961, however, Bushman had shed such mannerisms, and he gives a performance here that leads you to suspect he could have had a more distinguished career in sound film if he had gotten the breaks and the scripts.  The rest of the cast, however, ranges from merely adequate to down right atrocious, with leading man Dean Fredericks a case in point.

Ultimately, PHANTOM PLANET reads very much like an Ed Wood movie but without hilarious inadequacies of plot and script that you expect from such.  Fans of sci-fi ""B"" pictures of the era will likely enjoy it, and I give it three stars for them, but if you are looking for an unintentionally comic bad movie you'll find this one neither as bad nor as good as you might expect.

928531,2,6304818270,"I saw this movie when it first came out, (I was six or seven years old).  It scared me pretty good, I couldn't walk down darkened hallways or into dark rooms.  My older brother (by almost four years) however, exploited these conditions fairly well, and succeeded in terrorizing me even further, every chance that he got.

Without a doubt, this movie is hokey by today's standards.  But it was well worth the purchase price to relive an influential fraction of my childhood.",1123459200,2,473,4.7317073170731705
928532,2,6304818270,"Astronaut Frank Chapman (Dean Fredericks) lands on the rogue planet Rheton, shrinks down to the size of a gerbil, and encounters a race of tiny humanoids. He finds himself held captive, and in the middle of a war between the Rhetonites and the brutish Solarites. Chapman  is also forced to choose between two beautiful Rhetonite women. Uh oh! A hideous Solarite prisoner (Richard ""EEEGAH!"" Kiel) breaks loose, causing mayhem and doom. Can Chapman escape before everything goes pear shaped? PHANTOM PLANET is every bit as absurd as it sounds, so don't expect one second's worth of serious sci-fi. Quite entertaining under the proper circumstances...",1123372800,2,648,5.230769230769231
928533,4,6304818270,"This movie is an all-time classic. It is one of those movies that are so bad they hysterical. Watch for ""The Prisoner"" who is in a cage in the basement. He is the prototype for ""Gromet"" in the Wallace and Gromet movies - something never before discovered and a great trivia question.",1059177600,,283,4.461538461538462
928534,4,6304818270,"Phantom Planet is a generally-overlooked but thoroughly enjoyable slice of early-60s SF cheese. Not really good enough to be a ""good movie,"" not really bad enough to achieve Trash status; but I could watch this one every six months without getting tired of it. Dean Fredericks in the lead makes a quite unappealing, unsympathetic `hero,' lending a strange atmosphere to the movie right off the bat. Francis X. Bushman (the silent Ben Hur) and Anthony Dexter (fallen far from 1951's Valentino) lend kitsch appeal, and Coleen Gray and Dolores Faith, as the `mute girl,' provide potential love interest for drippy Fredericks. If you watch this with the mindset of a 10-year-old there's lots of fun and clever ideas and effects: the shrinking thing, passable outer space/rocketship sequences, the disintegrator floor panels and duel of death, the flaming Solarite death ships, etc. And the sad sack monster, played by clumsy giant-for-hire Richard Kiel (`Jaws'), has to be one of the most lovably moth-eaten, pathetically unthreatening creations to grace any B-flick; kind of Paul Blaisdell-meets-Harry Thomas at the thrift store. You could  probably suspend your disbelief and really enjoy this movie on a comic book level, or have a few friends over and laugh yourselves silly. Highly recommended.
For long-time fans of this movie, Image's DVD delivers a fine print of the film: sharp and detailed, great tonal scale, virtually spotless save for some very light speckling and a rare blemished frame. You'll never need to worry about upgrading from this one. It blows my VHS TV prints right off the map. Unfortunately, there is no trailer for the feature, and the only other `extra' is the chapter stops. There are five trailers included in an `easter egg,' but they're the same ones as on every other Image release. Considering all the movies in their catalog, they could dish out a few new ones already! A minor gripe though, and if you love this movie you'll want this disc anyway.",1003968000,52,1981,5.039634146341464
928535,1,6304818270,"This is what one would consider a ""crappy sci-fi movie"". It seems like half of it was made as they went along, and the ""planets"" look like they came from KFC. Half the time the actors don't even look like they know what they're doing.
I mean, everything is so stupidly explained. The reason Paul Chapman (the star) shrinks is because he ""inhaled [the planet]'s oxygen"" and ""became in proportion with everything else"" on the planet. Also, if he inhaled Earth's oxygen, he'd grow back to his normal size. As for how the whole language thing was described, the airwaves carried out sound waves and translated them to a language the lsitener could understand. Also, in a scene where Paul and his navigator had to repair the ship, they simply walked outside and started to repair it. In the words of Mike Nelson ""good thing there's so much gravity out in space"". Anyway, if you want to watch it, you're much better off watching the MST3K version so you can at least laugh at it.",987811200,3,973,4.565714285714286
