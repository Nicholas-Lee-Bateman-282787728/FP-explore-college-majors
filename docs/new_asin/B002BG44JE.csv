If you don't buy this movie, rent it cirst, and after doing so, i predict that not only will you buy it for yourself, but you will buy several more copies to give to those that you love. This movie is that good and too important to miss. Don't think about it, do it, you and those you love deserve and need it.  Just in case you're wondering, no I do not have a financial stake in nor know any of the people interviewed in the documentary, but I do know that you and those you love will love it.",1373932800,,768,4.0394736842105265
