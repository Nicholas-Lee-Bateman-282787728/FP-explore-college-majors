8649174,5,B00J9X94Q0,"The overall concept of the collection:

Bearing in mind the archive nature of this extended disc, it is important for potential purchasers to be aware of the nature of the recorded sound offered and the resultant long playing times achieved because of this. The following four paragraphs therefore repeat the technical information provided in the previous reviews and can be skipped past if already known and understood. New readers are advised to read those paragraphs carefully as they will explain the nature of this product.

Quite apart from the considerable musical content of this disc, all of which has been seen and heard for the purposes of this review, the huge playing time probably needs some explanation for those of a sceptical disposition. The Blu-ray format has a capacity of several DVDs in just the same way that DVDs have more capacity than VHS tapes and, in an earlier generation, LP (long playing) records had much greater capacity than 78 rpm records.

The greater capacity can be used in two ways. Usually it is used to carry High Definition files which, because of their high definition, require much more capacity. However, it would be just as possible for the Blu-ray disc to use its greater capacity to have much longer playing times when the source material is of lower resolution and thus requiring less capacity per item.

That is what has happened here. The original source material is that of television broadcasts taped on video tape and at the quality associated with television broadcasts between the late 1950's and early 1970's. Videotape could be described as Low Definition by contrast with modern High Definition recordings. Consequently we are able to experience all that broadcast material conveniently gathered together on a single disc.

Audio-video recording has been an area of great advancement since these live broadcast recordings were made. The quality of these recordings falls far below the standards achieved by EMI for example in the 1980's or Metropolitan Munich in the 1980's-1990's. As described above, these are standard definition recordings made at a time of infancy in that area of recording. Modern standard definition recording, let alone HD recording, is vastly superior and fundamentally a totally different product in terms of recording quality. In addition, those wishing for equivalent audio recording, LP or CD source, from the 1950's will be greatly disappointed. That, however, is to miss the point entirely. These recordings derive from French, Russian and BBC broadcasting of very limited audio-video quality but of high value to collectors in terms of archive footage which is otherwise unavailable. It is on that specific basis that these recordings must be judged and will appeal mainly to collectors with that interest in mind.

The featured Ensembles:

Thus we are introduced to the work of the following key ensembles - Rostropovich and Richter, the Istomin-Stern-Rose trio, the Amadeus Quartet, Zino Francescatti, and David Oistrakh and Yehudi Menuhin in various guises. In a review of a disc of this duration and coverage it would be invidious to single out items of superior merit. However it is fair and essential to note that each 'ensemble' is well represented with some core personal repertoire and that the 'live' nature of the broadcast material ensures a degree of special frisson which, for many, will overcome the obvious deficiencies of the recordings of those times.

The featured ensembles and some soloists are all represented by generous playing times. They are shown playing a range of music which has been chosen as being particularly associated with their individual repertoire. Thus Rostropovich and Richter are featured playing the five cello sonatas by Beethoven. These are key repertoire and are all given performances of intimate intensity, almost as if we are eavesdropping on private music making. The quality of the BBC recordings from 1964 is better than one might expect although the Richter solo item from Moscow 1966 is seriously compromised.

The Istomin, Stern and Rose Trio perform 3 Brahms trios and the 7 main Beethoven trios, all with intensity and outward fire. The French recordings from 1970-1975 are in colour and fuller toned than the previous set but inclined to some overloading in the top treble range.

The Amadeus Quartet recordings range from 1956 to 1973 and are listed in chronological order during which the recordings clearly improve from a very compromised start. The repertoire, mostly Mozart and Beethoven quartets played in entirety are joined by single movements from Schubert, Brahms and Bartok. The Mozart and Beethoven especially will be familiar to collectors of the Amadeus approach to these works.

The next group of  `ensembles' are really double concertos by Bach, Mozart and Brahms where the linking factor is Oistrakh partnered by Menuhin in the Bach, by his son David in the Mozart and Rostropovich in the Brahms. These are all strong and rewarding examples from 1958 to 1965 although the Bach and the Mozart are nowadays normally played in a lighter manner. Oistrakh remains an impressive soloist and throughout this disc his quality shines through, as does that of Rostropovich.

The selection featuring on Francescatti focusses on fine performances of Beethoven (2 sonatas and 2 Romances) with Casadesus and concluding with examples of his dazzling technique in Bazzini's La Ronde des Lutins. These are all French recordings from 1961 and 1979.

There follows a selection featuring Oistrakh as soloist from the late 1950's to early 1960's. These are a mixture of French and BBC recordings ranging from Bach's a minor concerto through to the acerbic double violin sonata by Prokofiev. Easier listening is provided by Beethoven (Spring Sonata) and single movements from mainly Schubert and Brahms.

The disc in completed by examples of Menuhin where the earlier playing from the early 1960's is technically surer than his later work - a recognised feature of his playing. The Franck sonata and the Schubert trio are the most satisfactory from that point of view although the recordings are not the best.

This is a collection that makes no claims of being comprehensively finite in terms of the featured ensembles or their featured repertoire. What it does offer is a valuable resource chronicling the work of some of the finest exponents of chamber ensemble playing from the early days of television broadcasting. As such it deserves the gratitude of interested collectors who will find it to offer very good value as well as musical illumination.

This collection will mostly be of great interest to those who have an interest in historical recordings and these have been gathered together and presented as a very convenient collection similar to that of the Classic Archive of Strings and the Classic Archive of Pianists released recently. The use of the Blu-ray format with its larger capacity has been imaginatively used to maximise access to a considerable amount of historical material which might otherwise have been lost to collectors of such material.",1402531200,9,7111,5.19109947643979
