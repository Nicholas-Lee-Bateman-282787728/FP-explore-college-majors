8619522,4,B000006QGF,"Having watched several serial killer bios recently I'm struck by the matter-of-fact way they behave when describing their heinous crimes, acts that are incomprehensibly evil. What's interesting too is how some of these men feel the need to be caught or somehow recognized for their misdeeds.

We learn in this BIOGRAPHY episode that Albert DeSalvo was one such killer.
Apprehended for an attempted rape, he freely confessed to the stranglings, first
to a fellow mental hospital inamate, later to the authorities.

In many ways his story after arrest is the meat of this documentary.
You may find a lot of it surprising, like he was never prosecuted for the stranglings,
or that DeSalvo actually escaped from prison in 1967.

It's really a very well done 43 minute show, narrated by Bill Kurtis.",1476489600,,794,5.0
