888432,1,630447525X,"This video leads you to believe that it is about lions, when, in fact there is a bunch filler about frogs and bugs etc.  If you have been to africa, you know that this is a sorry representation the lives of lions.  It is about a pride of lions in decline.  There is so little lion footage, they have resorted to filler stuff that is not related to lions.  Further, the reproduction quality of the tape is poor.  Kiley is wonderful, as usual, but they give him very little to work with.  This might appeal to a fifth grader but is clearly not up to N.Geographics standards. AVOID!",979344000,3,579,4.314814814814815
888433,5,630447525X,"This is one of the best National Geographic videos to date. The footage, content and filmmaker's narration is outstanding. The story of a motherless lion cub growing up in a pride is one of the best real-life dramas I've seen. It takes a viewer into the world otherwise unseen and inexperienced by a human. A viewer has glimpses of the every day life in the pride of lions. Joubert's film portrays the hunts, the roles of males and females in the pride, the struggle for survival, interaction between pride members and other inhabitants of Savuti. Another great film from Derek and Beverly!",977270400,,590,4.794117647058823
888434,5,630447525X,"Oh well, what can i say..it is a great piece of work. Brings out the societal order of lions like few others can. It emphasizes that each animal(Lion's in  this case but can be applied to all animals) is totally an individual with different temperaments(same as us homo sapiens). And i think you would feel the same after watching this document because that is how well it has been made. Beverly and Derecks's personal identification of their subjects is very good and gives this documentary its flavour of being drama like.
I highly recommend it, if not for lack of better convincing just to understand the animal world out there. At the end you question why is it that God blessed some of the cubs with more survival instinct than he did with other cubs. Africa's greatest cats and their lives...compelling till the end.",970617600,,822,4.708333333333333

7872788,5,630447525X,I had this once years ago but once our VHS player died we got rid of all of our VHS tapes.  I really missed this particular one.  All of the other sellers either did not have it in stock (and did not know when they would get it) or they were overseas sellers.  I now have a DVD/VHS burner/player so now I can watch it again.  Thank you!,1378166400,,336,3.8970588235294117
7872789,5,630447525X,"Lions Of Darkness is a very good documentary, and it would be nice if Nat Geo, up-graded it to Blue-ray. It is one of the more detailed stories of Lion survival in the African jungle by a pride of lions. The story line is very interesting, and entertaining. This movie has been out for awhile, but is more detailed than the current movies made today on the subject of lions.

It's good enough for Nat Geo, to seriously consider, upgrading this unto Blue-ray. This movie shows lion take-over of other prides, young male lions being driven out of the pride because they are now old enough to take care of themselves and pose a threat, and a future challenge, to the male lions already in control of the pride. I enjoyed the story of Tao, the youngest lion in the pride, 6 months younger than the rest, and the last to be ousted from the pride, after he was old enough to fend for himself. This movie is on DVD, and looks acceptable during an up-scaling from a blue-ray player. But would look even better in 1080p.",1314748800,,1011,4.406417112299465
7872790,5,630447525X,"This documentary has stayed with me for ten years.  It's a heart-rendering portrayal of life in the wilderness, the struggle to survive and the fight to dominate.  Beautifully photographed, it pulls no punches as it follows a pride of lions through brith and death.  It's both grim and gorgeous (and contrary to what one reviewer posted, there is no frog or bug filler in this program.",1188432000,,385,4.803030303030303
7872791,4,630447525X,"If I weren't extraordinarily fond of lions, I would have given this documentary a 3 for just one reason - too many of the shots are (admittedly) filmed under ""controlled conditions - "" using trained or at least habituated animals at a controlled facility.  When this kind of photography -and it's really obvious - is replaced by actual wild footage, the film comes alive and is definitely a 5;  the piece on the exiled and washed-up old male lion is tragic and riveting.  The shots of lions hunting are also great.  I wish they had not added the ""fake"" elements, but, still, this documentary is certainly worth purchasing.",1165276800,,622,4.731481481481482
7872792,5,630447525X,"One of the top two National Geographic documentaries.  Not quite as good as Eternal Enemies.  Beverly and Derek Joubert are unbelievable film makers and for a true lion fan, this documentary won't disappoint!",1138320000,,208,5.2727272727272725
7872793,3,630447525X,"This is a good movie if you want to learn the basics about Lions. If you need specific behaviors about them, buy something else. I watched this for an Animal Behavior class and I needed to do alot of extra research to find specifics. Overall a good movie!",1078876800,3,255,4.333333333333333
7872794,4,630447525X,"I think the reviewer that said this film was about bugs got his tapes mixed up, because there is nothing about insects in this film at all.  The documentary follows a pride of lions, particularly a young male that was born late and became orphaned.  His story is intriguing enough to base a film on, but we also witness an old lion desperately trying to cling to the life he once had, and the intricate process of raising a cub.  The only reason I gave this documentary four stars is because it ends rather abruptly, leaving the viewer wondering what happened to the male cub and his fellow pride-mates.  Another twelve minutes would have done this film some good, although I was thoroughly satisfied with my purchase...(from a rival company...sorry Amazon...I'll never do it again...you guys were cheaper anyway!!)",987379200,8,815,4.841726618705036
