8113293,1,B000EQH2OM,My wife asked me to buy this thinking it would magically make her lose weight that she really didn't need to lose but Ill never win that argument. Save your money and time.,1524787200,,172,4.242424242424242
8113294,5,B000EQH2OM,"I have been doing the Synergetic exercises with the pocket gym for several months now and really love them. Friends have been commenting that I look like I've lost weight and that, best of all, the shape of my body has shifted in a most positive way. I feel stronger, more flexible, more energetic and happier since using the pocket gym. I do 12 minutes first thing in the morning and then 2 to 5 minutes here and there throughout the day, especially if I've been sitting more than usual. It always gives me the most wonderful boost. I really like carrying my gym with me wherever I go!",1463875200,,586,4.385321100917431
8113295,5,B000EQH2OM,"I have the original, and, just received this one. I love them bith, but, this one is more effective with the pocketgym.",1373155200,,119,4.454545454545454
8113296,5,B000EQH2OM,"This device is great to use everyday.  If only for a few minutes at a time, it is possible to exercise your arms and core and feel like you've just gotten a good little exercise.  That is kind of hard to find.

I like to use it as an in-between exercise.  If I don't feel like doing a slow yoga and I don't feel like doing strenuous exercise, I generally reach for the pocketgym...esp. when I'm watching TV.  All the exercises are done standing and facing one direction - good for TV.

The device itself isn't that amazing, but it does work very well with the exercises that are provided.

My elbows get sore if I do to many pushups, so I use the pocketgym when they get sore but I still want to work out my upper body.

There really are no negatives to this device / exercise plan, or I would list them.",1261440000,5,804,4.141935483870967
8113297,5,B000EQH2OM,"It was the best purchase I ever made.  I use it almost every day.  The ""exercise"" routine is only 12 minutes a day, twice a day.  It's portable and convenient. The dvd has 3 routines on it.  I can incorporate using the pocket gym in my other exercise routines also.  I've  been sleeping better and have gained flexibility.  I recommend this product to every and anyone.  Great doing business with Amazon.",1204588800,7,404,4.591549295774648
