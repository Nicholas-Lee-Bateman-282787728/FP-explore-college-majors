8403069,4,B003R2AB98,"In this DVD Marta Montenegro works out with another woman, and both of them are very lean, muscular and fit, which I find attractive and inspiring.  Many of the moves work several muscle groups at the same time, so your time is used efficiently.  Marta explains the moves clearly, and since this is a strength workout with weights, the moves are done at a slow speed, which enables you to be careful with form - very important when using weights. I also like that attention is paid to working on balance - this is vital.  ( As we age, we lose balance, and can wind up in wheelchairs or walkers, just to prevent falling! )  It was also a plus that while many lunges and squats are part of the routine, she makes them different and more interesting than the traditional ones.  Okay, so why not five stars?  I don't care for Marta's personality - I don't find her encouraging.  This tone of this workout is that it's not intended to be ""fun"", and clearly the woman backing Marta didn't seem to have a good time, and never smiled.  Marta barely smiles, and does say some encouraging words.  But..... she really annoyed me by repeating over and over and over ""Come On!!!"", not in a warm and inspiring way, but more as a military command.  Not my style!  The three segments that are 21 minutes long, felt like at least 30 or 40 minutes long, and I kept hoping they would end soon.  Not because the workout was way too hard, but because it was just so much like work.  I like to enjoy my exercises, and this DVD just didn't suit my personality type.  Also.... there is no warm up or cool down.  So, please be aware of this and do your own.  All in all, I will do this DVD again.  No question, it's a good workout for your body.  But, at least at this point, I'm not tempted to buy another one of Marta's workouts.",1486598400,,1806,4.292899408284024
