This is an epic, mythic trial by the fire of self-discovery, using all the elements of the mythic hero's journey. At first our hero declines the mythic call to action. He finds selling his father's hair-oil and spiel both beyond him and not a part of him---he cannot honor his father, because of his own self. He wants more from life.

However, he finally answers the call to duty, out of his own basic goodness and fine inner principles, when he offers to deliver an ancient truck that has been sold by an elderly man who obviously cannot make the long and dangerous trip.

Our hero crosses a blazing desert landscape populated by demons---bandits---and evil spirits---death by dehydration. He reaches a run down old place in the middle of nowhere where he is flagged down by a boy who works there and offered tea. The boy is symbolic of the Harbinger or Gatekeeper, into the beyond. He attaches himself to our hero and the marvelous, magical-looking ancient truck, as they enter a doorway of no return into the vast sweep of the killing desert.

When the truck breaks down the boy disappears and returns with a small, impossibly fat, dirty, barely human-looking, local man, a  ""mechanic,"" an archetypal wizard, who can fix anything and make everything work, who makes a bargain to fix the truck if he will be transported by our hero to a ""fair"" that he knows is coming to a place he knows about. The classic Deal with a wizard.

I don't want to reveal any more here, except that we do meet with a sorceress who helps transform and settle all things concerned in this wonderful, creative, marvelous, brilliant, epic excursion into a wonderland of self-discovery and  classic morality.

Oh...when it comes, when he shows up: the character of the pesky hair-oil salesman is a spirit, an omnipresent, persistent agitator to help our hero make the transition of acceptance of his father, and able to make the leap to the roaring, fast, free, windy journey that remains ahead. His mission is to help our hero discover the true elixir of life. So...does he do it? :)

This is a fantastic film. Buy it; see it; you will want to do it all again.

8418693,4,B0048IU5X2,"A very different kind of Indian film than I'm used to seeing. Small, personal, quirky, funny, and sometimes quite touching, it follows a young man using the excuse of driving his uncle's ancient Chevy truck across the desert as a way to get away from having to continue on with his father's hair oil business.

Of course, along the way, he gathers friends and enemies, and learns a host of lessons about life, love, poverty and what it means to be a man.  While it was fun to see this familiar story in such a different cultural context, it is still a familiar story, at times too familiar.

There were also moments where the delicate blend of humor and reality didn't quite work - dangerous situations solved too cutely, complex relationships wrapped up in a few moments, important social issues touched on, but not explored.

Still, this is beautifully photographed, well acted, enjoyable and a very human movie, that also shows the world-wide power of film (on the truck are projectors and old films that serve our hero more than once).

Not quite a great film, but a charming, well made, and heart-felt one that's well-worth catching.",1342569600,,1138,4.756345177664975
8418694,4,B0048IU5X2,"The movie is slow but the more I watched, the more it drew me in. I thought the acting was good and the cinematography was really awesome. It is a little boring at times, as others have said. Its not neccesarily a movie that I would watch again with full attention but I still would like to own it and would recommend it to friends.",1307318400,,332,4.123076923076923

8418696,4,B0048IU5X2,"I've seen this movie twice and am baited for the DVD release.  It's a delight for the senses.  Whereas many of the films characters have never left my memory, which in itself is a testament to Dev, the actors and talent of all involved.  The comedy helps offset the occasional intensity.  There's true cinematic magic throughout and especially during the carnival scene.  I am left wanting more, a sequel perhaps?!  Cheers!",1292371200,3,423,4.887323943661972
8418697,1,B0048IU5X2,"Abhay Deol is Indian alternate cinema star and things are definitely on the up and up for this actor who seems to have found the right balance between art and commercial cinema. He was so good in Socha Na Tha, Aahista Aahista, Oye Lucky Lucky to name a few more watchable movies. I ventured out to see the Road Movie with this anticipation.

In the movie, Abhay Deol is facing a grim future, he has been handed the reins of his fathers massage oil business and he loathes this work. He jumps at the chance to make a road trip for delivering a truck for a family friend. This road trip supposed to have been interesting as he meets a host of characters that should have enhanced the movie and led to the possibility of the plot developing any further. But they do not and seem to be pointless just like road blocks, the director seemed to have been more interested in the visuals than the narration and content. The road trip could have made for a great travel film but visuals have no splendor to them. I do not recommend watching this film, this road movie is a dead end. One star. 12/1/10",1291852800,3,1090,4.3431372549019605
