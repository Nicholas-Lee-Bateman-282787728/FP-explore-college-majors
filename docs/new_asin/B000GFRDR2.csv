2607643,2,B000GFRDR2,"Night Feeders (Jet Eller, 2006)

I am encountering a rather surprising number of movies this year about which I can say they had a great deal of potential, but failed to live up to that potential in almost every respect. Night Feeders is the most recent of these, but to its credit, it probably comes closer to fulfilling that potential than most of the other movies I've said it about so far this year.

Four friends-- Donnie (Donnie Evans), John (Brett Gentile), Andy (Mike Monzitta), and Doug (Michael Ruff)-- are on a hunting vacation a ways out of town when a meteor falls from the sky. (Yes, this is yet another movie whose action begins with a meteor falling out of the sky.) The meteor contains some nasty aliens, and the four of them must survive the night as the creatures stalk them.

There are a few subplots, but I can't tell you about them without spoiling things. This is because, aside from some quick character introductions, we don't see anyone from any of those subplots until those subplots begin-- which is way, way too far into the movie. It almost seems as if the movie as scripted ran too short, and they needed to tack some stuff on at the last minute. Or it would, except that the subplot involving Donnie and Terry (Kate Leahey) is the strongest part of the movie. It's where everything falls together. Previously, Donnie (and pretty much everyone else in the movie) is there for the sole purpose of providing a buffet for the aliens. Once Donnie's character gets a chance to grow, however, he immediately sheds the two-dimensionality and grows into something well beyond a stereotype. If the whole movie had contained this kind of characterization along with the interesting plot twists, offbeat humor, and nonstop action, I'd be saying this was one of the great neglected movies of 2006. As it is, I can see why it was neglected, but if you want to see what could have been (and what someday may be, if Eller makes his third movie quicker after his second than the gap between his first two), give it a look. **",1178841600,4,2040,4.5989010989010985
2607644,4,B000GFRDR2,"A meteor crashes into a small lake in the countryside.  Two fishermen are almost immediately killed by something that came out of it.  Something very hungry.  A group of hunters are nearby and soon find themselves being hunted by the things from the meteor.  They are fast and strong and there seems to be a lot of them.  Are they multiplying?  The hunters are casual hunters from the city and a gentle redneck.  Now they must be real hunters if they hope to stay alive.  They run to a local farmhouse where they hope to make a stand.  Their one hope is that the creatures don't like light.  But these creatures are strong and determined and farmhouses do not tend to be built as fortresses.

Daylight finally arrives and were are down to our final survivors.  They must fix the farmer's truck or be stuck for another night as there is no other haven in walking distance.  With the daylight the tone of the movie changes and we meet another survivor.  Tension builds again and the sun begins to set.  The ending is wonderful and I am glad the film makers risked it.

This is an interesting film.  Most films like this start out gentle and escalate with the monsters at the end.  In this one we get the monsters right off the bat and get some of the ore tranquil moments later in the film.  It may be different but it works.  It is fresh and new and much better than I was expecting.  I really liked some of these characters and would really like to know what happens to them after the end of the film.  Despite the good story there are signs of its low budget.  For instance, the same bright-white cloth is found repeatedly in different places whenever they are looking.  But considering the script was not skimped upon these small reminders are at most just minor annoyances.  Check it out.",1169769600,3,1791,4.436923076923077
2607645,5,B000GFRDR2,"This movie was great. For being a B horror flick, it was as good as or better than most horror movies I've seen and I watch alot of movies. It had a good story line and that actors were great at playing hillbillies from the South. I know that I will watch this again, and I look forward to the next movies these producers put out, as I am sure they'll be just as good, and fun to watch as this one.",1168560000,,398,3.8658536585365852
2607646,4,B000GFRDR2,"Although the CGI's could have been better, I liked the story line and the humor along with the gore. I enjoy some of the older horror films and some of the new ones. Even when CGI's are good, the film can be very poor in content. I like this one!",1168300800,,246,3.94
2607647,4,B000GFRDR2,"This is a well paced low budget thriller/comedy from a small, very dedicated group of filmmakers. And it shows!  Aliens, Guns and a Guy named Donnie! Oh My!

O.K. , I might have noticed a couple of errors, but I didn't care. The characters, a group of city boys on a weekend- warrior style hunting trip, find themselves the hunted-- by little ravenous aliens! The plot is timeless in this little horror/thriller dynamo. In the vein of ""Deliverance"", ""Night of the Living Dead"" but with enough humor from the laughable cast to keep me amused the entire movie. Eller's keen direction keeps the story moving.

I liked the ""Look"" of the movie. It was gritty and real. It creates that dark spooky feeling that doesn't just happen by itself  The camera work is solid and engaging with just enough ""shakiness"" to keep the audience off balance.

The Special Effects Guys were working overtime on this one! See for yourself! There's one scene that I'm not sure how they pulled it off! One minute he's sitting in the chair and the next...Well, he's not. It's the most

 memorable shot in the movie for me. Whereas it's obvious the aliens are CGI, the execution of all the computer generated effects is skillful and sparingly used. Less Is More, as they say.

Last, but not least is the powerful , pulsing Sound Track. It's a big sound ! Something that usually is not present in small(micro)- budget indies! It really sets the tone from the beginning and never lets up.

This film is not for younger children due to some graphic content. But if you enjoy a good story, well executed by passionate indie filmmakers then you should check this gem out.",1160179200,4,1638,4.640138408304498

He is a bigger red neck than Larry the Cable Guy by a HUGE margin. But he is so easy going and you can't help but like the guy for his rather provincial wisdom right from the start. The rest of the actors weren't...well...terrible or anything --they didn't have a chance because of the obvious lack of budget for the film-- but you can tell right from the start that these guys are DEFINITELY NOT professional actors. The creatures were horribly done and cheap imagery didn't help...at all! But it was so bizarre, that I actually (almost) enjoyed this thing!

2607868,4,B000GFRDR2,"Shortly after a monster-infested meteor crashes and sics its passengers on an unsuspecting rural community, four friends head into the North Carolina woods for a weekend of huntin', fishin' drinkin' and good ol' boy bondin'. Their car becomes damaged when they hit a deer, so they decide to camp nearby and deal with the damage later.

What could possibly go wrong?

Despite the cheesy K-Mart CGI, largely indifferent special effects and a few plot holes (why, for example, when you know the baddies are afraid of the light, wouldn't you turn on every available light source and never EVER go near a darkened room or shadowy corner of the building?), I truly enjoyed this quirky, low budget redneck buddy film. The acting was competent and engaging and the storyline had some unique detours around the usual formula scripting for horror potboilers.  There were, for example, no annoying randy teenage road trippers which I for one was delighted to find absent, and no screaming girls flitting helplessly through the woods wearing high-heels and a bikini. The hero was not the muscular stud able to arm-wrestle savage aliens into submission, and while there were plenty of victims they weren't the ones you had already numbered one-through-ten during the first fifteen minutes.

And it was funny!

Granted it was no Pegg and Frost production, but I found it had a similar ability to make the audience actually care about the characters while being amused by their antics.

If you aren't scouting for Techno-Stun cinematics or a cinematic metaphor of postmodern deconstructionism...whatever the hell that means...this is an entertaining way to spend a little over an hour.  I gave it one extra star for effort :)",1410739200,7,1710,5.042553191489362

2607870,4,B000GFRDR2,"I almost stopped watching this after seeing the horrible Playstation 1 level of CGI monsters in the film. They really suck and suck hard, the money to produce them would have been better spent on one decent creature suit. Fortunately as I was about to write a scathing review based on only the first 10 minutes of the film I noticed that someone had written a 5 star review and read it. Intrigued by what I read I decided to watch the rest of the film and am very glad I did so.

Writer/director Jet Eller understands well the limitations he's dealing with but its clearly determined to make the best, most entertaining and enjoyable movie possible on no real budget. Shot in Charlotte, NC using only local talent for all aspects of the production. As both a southerner and a film maker of the no budget sort myself I really appreciated his efforts here and applaud the results. The set up is simple a meteor crashes in the woods which turns out to be an egg/spore which infests said woods with dozens of voracious nocturnal monsters. Add to the mix a quartet on a hunting trip, an abusive couple and one park ranger and you've got your basic monster movie set up.

Now for me what always separates the crap films from the good ones is most often the writing and the writing here is surprisingly good. These folks all feel like characters I grew up around (Im from SC myself). They feel and act rather believably with good dialogue and characterizations. Also in a pleasant twist Jet doesn't play to conventions. Characters you are certain are going to be monster fodder from the get go aren't and visa versa. The pacing is excellent and Jet keeps the action moving understanding that this is the best way to keep his audience involved in such low budget fare. My hats off to all involved for creating such a surprisingly entertaining film. If you can get past the absolutely horrible cgi aliens there is a real gem waiting to be discovered here.",1410652800,8,1946,4.5413105413105415

2607877,4,B000GFRDR2,"This is how a indie movie with a limited budget should be made. They recognized their limitations i.e. CGI, keeping locations to a minimum, use low lighting to keep CGI expouser to a minimum and above all they kept their story simple. ""GOOD JOB GUY'S"" NF is in many ways your typical horror movie scenario with a group of boy's heading out on a hunting trip that goes horribly wrong. In this story  the boy's aren't being chased/attacked by the standard werewolf, vampires or even bigfoot, but they are being hunted by $^#@*(.
The acting isn't to bad and the director does a good job of keeping everyone and thing inline to keep this campy and silly at times story going. Are mistakes made? You bet, but for me they were easily overlooked for many reasons, like for one, breaking some of the rules for who lives and who doesn't The stories pacing is even and has a good flow to it and scene tension is effective when called upon too.
This movie was fun to watch because the characters weren't soodumb or irritating that you wished ill will upon them and you want them to survive. This is becoming very rare these days the way characters are written and developed. To top off everything else that I liked with this movie was the lack of cursing, nudity, sex and limited violence and gore. It's very hard to make a watchable movie these days without a lot of sex, drugs, violence, gore or nudity, but these guy's did just that. 4 stars",1408579200,2,1433,4.469465648854962

2607880,4,B000GFRDR2,"Oddly enough, this Sci-fi flick isn't half bad.  True, the creatures themselves are a bit cartoonish, the CGI is woefully underdone (more rough draft than finished product).  The plot isn't that original, a group of hunters come across some nasty critters in a forest one night.  Naturally, a meteor is involved.  Terror is unleashed in the form of hungry beasties.  The four hunters take refuge in an isolated house and try to survive the night.  Daylight brings some relief, but not when you're out in the middle of nowhere and need transportation to escape.
It's remarkable what the filmmakers do with this seed of an oft-used idea and some inspired casting.  A script overloaded with humor also helps.  It's fast, furious, and blessedly short.  The ending is a hoot and a half.  In a strange way, it's really quite charming.",1369699200,,828,4.85
2607881,4,B000GFRDR2,"As a very young elf, lets say the year was 1993, Sid began to notice a couple trends he just couldn't get enough of. One being terrible movies which we found hilarious aka B and the second was hillbillies. The love of b came from years of free movies channels the cable company forgot to shut off after a free trial, and the hicks came thanks to episodes of Cops. The guy who huffed gold spray paint may have been the deciding factor for our obsession. Anyway, when you can combine a terrible movie and hillbillies you're pretty much sitting on a pile of b dynamite just waiting to go off. Night Feeders has capitalized on the concept earning it four stars from the b enthusiast himself. It was released in 2006 being a film most will have no clue about, unless you scour $5 bins with precision force. Luckily Sid finds all the gems so we present to you, Night Feeders.

We start with a hilariously cheap meteorite crashing deep in the heart of the south near four complete hicks on a hunting trip. One fellows name just happens to be Brett, no coincidence there huh Santa? As they take hold of the ultimate redneck weekend they notice some strange eyes in the woods (looked like 2 green light bulbs) and decide to investigate. They come to realize they are under attack from 3 ft aliens straight out of a slow study graphics team. These things just look hilarious, and that's exactly what we were looking for. The terrible actors, delightful hicks, and awful effects won us over by bringing back all the old hilarious memories.

So Night Feeders is a film that could only b enjoyed by the true b lover. It really terrible but entertaining in the way we always hope for. Can't remember a horror film capitalizing on rednecks since the truck scene in Halloween 4, where Myers dumps about four of them over the back of a pick up truck. Yeah put that one in slow motion and you have yourself quite the evening.

Also, the people that I thought would survive didn't, and the most unlikely heroes emerged! Yes, the CGI creatures are rather low-grade, but I found this only added to their otherworldliness! Most of whatever money there was must have gone toward the gore fx, as they are quite well done. Alas, most folks have never even heard of this little creeper.

2607884,5,B000GFRDR2,"Most film critics will tell you that a martial arts film rises or falls solely on the strength of the fight scenes and the ability of the fighters in them. Likewise there are those who will swear that horror movies depend solely upon the believability of the monsters and the special effects, and whether or not they look convincing usually comes down to one factor-- how much money was spent upon them. Then there are those of us who, while we can't help but agree with the statement regarding martial arts films, still plant out flat little feet firmly on the ground and shout into the wind of prevailing thought. ""NO! Sometimes you can have a really great little horror movie with MEDIOCRE SPECIAL EFFECTS!""

Well, the time has come for me to retract that statement. Having viewed NIGHT FEEDERS, a film made in and around Charlotte, North Carolina, with local effects talent that redefines the term ""amateurish"" and a budget that brings new meaning to the words ""minisule"", I must now say that, ""Sometimes you can have a really great little horror film with PATHETIC special efects."" Yep. All you need are some capable actors, a nifty story, and a director who can pull things together in an unusual manner and still make them work. That's a pretty tall order, but that's exactly what Writer & Director Jet Eller has managed to do in NIGHT FEEDERS.

The first thing that Eller does is realize that what his audience wants is action. So almost from the word ""Go"" that's what he gives us. We're introduced to our characters in only the sketchiest of terms. In fact a meteor has crashed AND two deaths have already occurred before we even meet out main protagonists; John the Smart Guy, Andy the Young Studly Guy, Doug who has Victim written all over him, and Donnie the Redneck Slob who also seems doomed to become an alien entree. Other possible hero/victims are a young couple--he's abusive and doesn't like her stinky perfume so she winds up clocking him with a piece of wood, and a game warden named Marty who's out looking for Clyde and Helen's two cows.

Its John, Andy, Doug, and Donnie are the focus of the film though. Three of them are city boys, and Donnie's the only one who really seems to know which end of a gun the shot comes out of. Nontheless they're out hunting. The only thing they've bagged by the time they make camp is the deer they hit with John's mother's car. It isn't long, and I really mean IT ISN'T LONG, before they're under seige by alien monsters whose only weakness (other than southern Bar-B-Cue) seems to be photophobia. John, concludes that the meteor sample he's been pondering really resembles an eggshell more than anything else, and everyone else concludes that they really want to be inside the farmhouse they passed a few miles down the road.

To say anymore would be to ruin the film, but trust me this is literally just the begining of an unusually enjoyable redneck romp that breaks a few of the cardinal rules of horror flix, especially in regard to structure and pacing, but still manages to come out a winner. Why? Because it really makes you care about all of these characters, and one in particular. It constantly does unexpected things, like reintroducing characers you've completely forgotten about and having them become crucial to the plot. Just when you think its going to pull a NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD on you, it doesn't. It avoids most of the cliches that other films fall into with such graceful sidesteps that you hardly notice. But as I said before, in the end this film owes much of its success to the characters and the actors who portray them. Their good ol' boy, down-home likeability makes a big difference in caring about whether or not they live or die at the the hands (and teeth) of these very crudely annimated CGI creatures.

Its funny too.

2607885,5,B000GFRDR2,"Just a short note here.

Yes, it's a popcorn movie.  It is better written and acted and directed than most.  The idea is a run of the mill Science Fiction plot, but carried out a little better than most--hense, the five stars.

I do recommend this movie, even though the computer graphics are dated, some of the actors, writer, director made up for it.  It's like all of us that keep doing these reviews say--it's all in the writing, directing, acting....not the special effects or the budget.

Of course on the Casablance scale, this movie wouldn't even rate one star.  But on the popcorn scale, it rates a solid five.  Lake Placide type writing, directing, the acting could have been better, but I honestly feel the 'little round man' was best for the lead part and hero.  The number two actor that helped make the movie was (deleted by oldtechno for good reasons).  The third was the 'game and fish' warden.

All in all, as I said, better than most of the rest.

A terrific script, intelligent and very funny, and some good performances. Well photographed and the beasties were shown and were pretty scary. Some good, tense, moments.

Needless to say, the cover shot bears no resemblance to the creatuers. But it is definitely one of the better horror films around, low budget or not.",1202169600,2,470,4.949367088607595
2607887,2,B000GFRDR2,"I'm a bit perplexed by the positive reviews here.  A low budget is not a valid excuse to create junk, as many excellent low-budget movies have proved.

One good thing about this movie is the big redneck-ish guy.  Avoiding spoilers, let's just say he's the only well-developed character in the film and my opinion of him did a complete 180.

There are pluses; some very convincing after-the-fact gore, some surprisingly well-written humor, the aformentioned well-done character, and there is one simply great moment when a survivor is snatched from a chair.

Otherwise there's absolutely nothing here, even if the positive comments above seem like the makings of a good flick.  The CGI is just utterly awful awful awful (repeat, rinse, repeat).  Why bother if you're going to do it so badly?  The alien creature design is pretty poor and they don't look strong enough to break a twig, let alone maul someone to the extent here.

I've seen it several times, and have enjoyed it enough to keep coming back for more. I don't think they intended to take itself too seriously, a bunch of good old boy buddies going off on a hunting trip, I guess it was, but they ended up being the hunted themselves. They were well-armed and should have been able to easily defeat those creatures.  Most of them made some really dumb moves, though, for instance, like why would you sit near a big window when you know those things were right outside, and  it made absolutely no sense to go back into that house looking for a camera (for what????) after they had already escaped.  The surprise is which one of them turns out to be the hero, and who, when left to do things on his own, ended up being the resourceful one, and he even got the girl, too.
