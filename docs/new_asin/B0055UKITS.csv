8458833,5,B0055UKITS,"This 3-DVD set is worth more than I paid.  A martial artist for 46 years, this is one of the best  teaching videos that I have seen.  There is a wealth of information and technique to learn, and you cannot absorb it all quickly.  Study, study, study!
I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn real self-defense.",1461542400,,321,4.389830508474576
8458834,5,B0055UKITS,"This is the first Guided Chaos (Attack Proof) DVD set I purchased and it is easily the best martial arts instructional DVD I have seen (and I have seen a lot over the years).  It is very long (six hours) and it took me several days to watch all of it when I first got it.  Now I tend to go back and review short sections (five minutes or so) at a time and integrate them into my martial practice.  If I could only have one martial arts DVD set, this would be it.

So you probably think I'm going to tell you to rush out and buy it now, but this is a fairly advanced DVD.  Unless you have already read the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attack-Proof-2nd-Edition/dp/0736078762/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attack Proof - 2nd Edition</a>&nbsp;(at least) and better yet already understood the basics from it and the two companion DVD sets (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Attack-Proof-Companion-Part-One-Enhanced-Close-Combat-for-Self-defense-and-Street-Survival-2-Disc-Set/dp/B0055PHCAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Attack Proof Companion Part One: Enhanced Close Combat for Self-defense and Street Survival (2 Disc Set)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Attack-Proof-Companion-Part-Two-Cultivating-Internal-Energy-for-Close-Combat-Self-defense-and-Street-Survival-2-disc-set/dp/B0055UDEV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Attack Proof Companion Part Two: Cultivating Internal Energy for Close Combat, Self-defense and Street Survival (2 disc set)</a>) that proceed this one, you many not be able to get as much out of this set.

Having said that, if you have a fairly high level of skills in martial arts already, you may be able to get a lot out of these DVDs.  For example, if you have practiced MMA (kickboxing or Boxing and understand fighting in the clinch) and you have developed the ability to be relaxed when you spar and understand issues of angles, you might be able to get a lot out of this set, even if you can't get everything.  If you have practiced Tai Chi and studied with an instructor who understands combat applications of Tai Chi (not just push hands) and teaches it well (note: this is extremely rare, but if you know what I am talking about....) or if you study Aikido with an understanding of the more subtle issues of Atemi (striking) as it fits into the practice and you have significant experience with Rondori, you might be able to get something out of this DVD set without having seen the previous materials.

In any case, I strongly suggest you get the book Attack Proof with this set if you don't have it already.

If it isn't fairly obvious from what I have said, ability in practice of martial arts is the key.  You cannot learn martial arts from books and DVDs alone.  You really need practice and good instruction.  What you can do is learn to develop your attributes (which is best done with the Attack Proof book and the first two DVD sets), get an understanding of what you can do to develop with a partner and, when you are training with a partner, have material you can refer back to do develop your skills and improve as your understanding grows (which is what this DVD set is good for).

This DVD set is really like a classic book.  As your experience grows, you can come back to it time and again to deepen your practice.  But, like a classic book, you probably want to be a fairly good reader before you try to tackle it.

So what will you learn from this set of DVDs?  How to be unavailable to your opponents attacks (how not to get hit or put into grappling holds) while you are able to attack from unexpected angles.  As anyone with significant boxing experience knows, the punch that takes a person out is often the one he never sees coming.  Being able to deliver a strike like that when the fight is already on puts you at a great advantage.

Getting to the place where you can reliably deliver these two advanced abilities (be unavailable to his attack and bring an unavoidable attack to him) requires basic attributes (conditioning) and lots of practice.  This DVD set helps you develop in the practice and explains how to develop yourself.  A list of contents is below, although it probably won't make sense if you have not looked at the book.

I suppose I should tell you a bit about my background so you can understand where I am coming from as a martial artist.  My first experience with martial arts was when my parents enrolled me in a traditional JiuJitsu class as a child.  As a teenager, I studied Kenpo Karate, followed by Wing Chun.  After college, I took up Aikido.  At the police academy, I learned the Koga method.  I have studied Tai Chi and practiced push-hands.  I studied MMA, kickboxing and BJJ and taught defensive tactics for police officers.

The technical quality of martial arts DVDs varies a lot, so you may want to know about the technical qualities.  The sound is clear throughout and you don't see a microphone.  The lighting is good and the action is always easy to see.  The camera person clearly understood where to point the camera and where to zoom in.  This is broadcast quality video work.

The editing is what really sets this production apart.  There is zero fluff in this DVD set; it is pure content.  That's why I tend to watch just a few minutes at a time: it's that tight.  The menus are easy to use and you can easily get just the section you want.
