8325342,5,B000KQF9DW,"This is an outstanding series of DVDs for experienced Uechi Ryu practitioners or serious students of traditional Okinawan martial arts. Master Takayasu demonstrates excellent technique and embodies the spirit of Uechi Ryu. As an experienced practitioner of Uechi Ryu (30 years) what I found unique about this series, is that Master Takayasu includes applications in the form of both bunkai(breakdown of the application of kata movements with no variations) as well as oyo (different variations of kata technique)for all 8 Uechi Ryu kata as well as applications for the secondary exercises (hojoundo) or technique exercises. Typically Uechi students learn bunkais for only 2 of Uechi's 8 katas: Kanshiwa and Seisan katas only. More recently, Okikukai has added Sanserui bunkai (as well as a 9th kata Ryuko). Providing applications for each kata provides a famework for the practitioner to think more deeply about the range of applications and demonstrates the effectiveness/practicality of the art. As an added bonus, master Takayasu adds supplemental strengthening exercises using hand grips and bands that help strengthen defensive techniques. Overall, this DVD series is an excellent addition to your Uechi Ryu library along with the highly recommended 5 volume series by Master Shinyu Gushi and the Okikukai 2006 DVD covering their entire training curriculum.",1257465600,5,1362,5.552884615384615
