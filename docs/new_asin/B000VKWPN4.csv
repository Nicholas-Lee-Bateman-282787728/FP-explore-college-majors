8219228,5,B000VKWPN4,"Almost everyone who knows about this movie knows it from the Mystery Science Theater 3000 satire version of it. But to actually watch the film as it was originally intended is something totally different. For one thing, the MST3K version cut out a lot of the film and really made it less artistic than the full version. Even though the movie is very low budget, I thought it was never boring. The characters are all very original and atypical. I showed the original version to my girlfriend before she saw the MST3K version and she was engrossed in the film enough to shout at the TV whenever there was a confrontation between the protagonists and antagonists. The film also gets bonus points for being largely appropriate for all audiences. The dialogue contains no swearing, violence is not too extreme or graphic, and the heroes definitively win at the end to the fading out of triumphant music.",1380412800,,898,4.762820512820513
8219229,2,B000VKWPN4,"In wonderful Canada, a young man named Troy (Christian Malcolm) finds a map that belonged to his late father, Thomas, an archaeologist who had a furtive and deadly run-in with Satoris (Shane Marceau), the leader of a mysterious cult. He soon finds his life in peril as he is chased across Canada by terrorizing cult members but receives help in the form of a wanderer named Zap Rowsdower (Bruce J. Mitchell). Can they save their lives and discover the truth behind the archeaological mysteries?

Let's keep it real. Most people know this film as the main entree of one of the best Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes ever. It is available as a part of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Science-Theater-3000-Vol-XVII-The-Crawling-Eye-The-Beatniks-The-Final-Sacrifice-Blood-Waters-of-Dr-Z/dp/B0030ATZHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Science Theater 3000, Vol. XVII (The Crawling Eye / The Beatniks / The Final Sacrifice / Blood Waters of Dr. Z)</a>&nbsp;set. Still, it is not as bad as one might think. It is boring and amateurish in many ways but at least the plot makes sense and Mitchell gives an interesting performance as the endearing bumpkin Rowsdower. The full length movie has extra scenes which make the movie more sensible. The movie was a 20-something film student's project and it is impressive given that context. This might be mediocre film-making but I give them an A for effort. The director actually does a lot of great work in film documentaries, believe it or not.

The cover of this VHS tape is amazing! I have never seen such dishonesty in advertising in quite some time. This is hilarious!! Rowsdower goes from an overweight guy with a huge mullet to Kevin Sorbo as Hercules while Troy goes from wiry nerd to the missing Baldwin brother, Zeppo Baldwin. The cover alone brought me many laughs and it is an interesting VHS cover. Long live Rowsdower!",1349222400,2,1929,5.40531561461794
8219230,1,B000VKWPN4,A horrible piece of cinema from Canada. Not much is to be expected when a film is shot for $1500. The only saving grace is Zap Rowsdower. The down n out drifter who used to belong to the ridiculous cult this is the focal point of the film. I didn't know they were looking for the city in the film. It focuses a lot on some boy who's looking for his dad. The cover is misleading since neither the boy or Rowsdower have any muscle mass. The cover needs to have the sweet mullet that Rowsdower sports throughout the film. Stay away from this unless it's the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 version.,1339977600,,592,4.294642857142857
8219231,3,B000VKWPN4,"A.K.A. The Final Sacrifice, this is a film featured in one of Mystery Science Theater 3000's most revered episodes (which has yet to be released in DVD format. Keep your fingers crossed, fellow MSTies.) To be perfectly honest, the movie is pretty stupid, the acting bizzare/nonexistent and the film...Who cares? It's every bit as classic a schlock fest as Manos, Space Mutiny, or Hobgoblins.

This movie has something not even The Dark Knight had going for it. That something is...Rowsdower. Zap Rowsdower. Once you've finished watching this movie, you too will wonder if there's beer on the sun.",1221868800,5,596,5.081632653061225
