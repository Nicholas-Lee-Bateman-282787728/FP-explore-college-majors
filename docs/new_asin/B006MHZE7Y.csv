8500824,5,B006MHZE7Y,GREAT LITTLE MOVIE!,1477353600,,19,5.666666666666667
8500825,5,B006MHZE7Y,"a special view of some things in our life. its more than underrated.(same as The Shins) i like that...vnice actors, great camera and pictures...  (robert, germany)",1446768000,,163,5.269230769230769
8500826,5,B006MHZE7Y,I found this film to be entertaining and heartfelt. James mercer is fantastic. The story invents itself over and over again and shows a portrait of real life that I myself have felt from time to time.,1396483200,,200,4.4324324324324325
8500827,3,B006MHZE7Y,"The Movie has the Shins lead singer James Mercer which alone merits three stars. Other than that, the movie is barely worth the time it takes to watch it. Yes, even for an independent film.

Pros: the main actors
Cons: everything else",1391472000,,234,4.571428571428571
8500828,5,B006MHZE7Y,"Good movie, my favorite James Mercer, Good price, good quality! worth watching! I feel everyone can see themselves in the movie",1373328000,,127,5.095238095238095
8500829,3,B006MHZE7Y,By now indie movies have had so many marginally connected sad suburban types enduring a quiet season of desperation that it's hard to be surprised any more.  If this were made in the 1990's it would have been groundbreaking but this pond has been fished dry.  The actors do their best with back to back morose episodes that seldom have enough snap crackle pop.,1369958400,,360,4.609375
8500830,2,B006MHZE7Y,"This film's pacing is torturous. Not much of a plot, either. The acting is very amateurish. If the firector was serious he wouldve gotten trained actors instead of making a cheap play for street cred by casting indie musicians in the main roles. With the exception of some characters who overact, most of the characters overacting are borderline catatonic. It's like a zombie movie movie without the blood and gore.",1350086400,,415,4.942857142857143
8500831,5,B006MHZE7Y,This film is not only touching and funny but also contains some gorgeous shots of the northwest.  I recommend to anyone who appreciates good filmmaking that is uncorrupted by the studio system.  These characters are so memorable and sweet.  You will laugh and cry.,1335398400,5,264,4.954545454545454
8500832,5,B006MHZE7Y,"This movie is a stark and beautiful portrait of human existence. Searching for the meaning in the connections we have with each other and the world around, this story reminds us that sometimes all we have in life is the story we leave behind. I highly recommend this movie.",1335139200,3,273,4.591836734693878
8500833,4,B006MHZE7Y,"This was actually a lot better than we expected. The interconnecting stories are cohesive...eventually...and the acting is good. Our 2010 Seattle International Film Festival screening audience was clearly invested in the outcome, but none of us were doing handstands over it.

Even though two of the main characters are (capably) played by lead singers from two well-known local bands: James Mercer, front man for The Shins; and Carrie Brownstein of Slater-Kinney, I think this film will have a problem finding an audience, as it isn't funny enough to be considered a comedy, the singing is incidental, and the drama is very understated.

This film centers around the detritus of life. One character is hired to help clear out the house of an elderly woman after she dies, another deals with abandoned dogs at the animal shelter, a third one works in a Salvation Army-type drop-off station. I very much appreciated the way the gal did her job of sorting clothes, books, toys, dishes, etc., etc., etc. And I admired the way she handled the situation when she discovered a burial urn that contained the ashes of a child.

None of these people are mean; each is trying to make his or her way through a marginal existence and still maintain a modicum of dignity. I like that...

This review was originally released May 2010, but finally showed up in a few theaters in April, 2011. In keeping with this glacial pace, according to Amazon.com, the DVD is just being released on 04-24-12!",1335139200,8,1480,4.861111111111111
