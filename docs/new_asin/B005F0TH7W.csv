4670269,3,B005F0TH7W,I always like to watch a few Christmas Themed movies this time of the year to get in the mood. This was not a good choice. It is inderacted with characters that are underdeveloped and not easy to warm up to. Definitely will not be on my list for next year.,1324080000,,256,4.03921568627451
4670270,2,B005F0TH7W,"I watched the movie expecting good things from Cheryl Ladd and barry Bostwick. Very disappointed in the acting, the say the least. It was almost painful to watch this movie, and and was tempted to shut it off several times. After watching the whole movie, I wish I had turned it off. The last ten or fifteen minutes were good, but you had to watch the first hour or so to get to that point. i would have given it a 1 star rating, but the ending made me feel sorry and give it a 2 star.",1321747200,,485,4.010309278350515
4670271,2,B005F0TH7W,"Great story line but Barry Bostwick just didn't fit nor did he do a good job of acting. He looked like an 80 year old drunk, and pretty much acted as much. The supporting cast did pretty good...  I usually cheer for the ""over-the-hill"" actors when they get a chance to shine one more time, but this just wasn't a good role for Barry. This movie will be donated to the library.",1321574400,,376,4.222222222222222
4670272,3,B005F0TH7W,"This isn't a mindless holiday romance and it really isn't geared to children.
Cheryl Ladd plays her role well as Sarah, an even-keeled woman who has basically raised her two daughters to adulthood without the help of her absentee husband. When he sets up a meeting with her after a prolonged separation she has no idea what is coming. He wants her to finally sign the divorce papers so he can go off to the Bahamas and marry his girlfriend that is about the age of his daughters--and he wants his daughters to come to the wedding. Barry Bostwick is convincing as Pete, the irresponsible husband/father who has found an exit every time things got hard. His wife agrees to sign  the divorce papers if he tells their daughters about the divorce and his upcoming nuptials, and suddenly he finds himself on the floor, in pain and gasping for breath.
Pete ends up in the hospital, but refuses to stay. Sarah, who is a pediatrician, keeps him at their home to watch over him until the tests for his diagnosis are completed and he is in the clear and this means he is in on the family Thanksgiving and Christmas. This angers their oldest daughter, who has never forgiven her Dad for leaving them. And both daughters are surprised to learn that their parents have never officially been divorced.
*SPOILERS*
Things get pretty tangled in a web that includes surrogate motherhood, a widower next door who is very friendly with Sarah and who happens to be a friend of Pete's and their daughter's father-in-law, the youngest daughter's boyfriend who is leaving the country, and Pete's young fiancee who is beginning to feel neglected and shows up at a most inopportune time. The storyline also includes a death, a home birth, and an angry tirade from daughter to father.
This movie is about forgiveness, relationships and realizing what is most important. It is not action-packed, or filled with comedy, though you may chuckle now and then. You may also need a tissue a time or two.
As far as family friendliness goes, this movie would probably not hold the interest of young children, and there are some things parents may not want to have in a family film, even though the back cover touts that it won four Doves. Some of it may be inappropriate and some may just be something you don't want to have introduced to very young children. In an early scene of the movie you see Pete and his fiancee packing at ""their"" home for their move to the Bahamas, where they will be married. He is in his PJs and robe and she is wrapped in a towel. Later, at a going away party given by coworkers, Pete's fiancee says to him, ""Let's make a baby on New Year's."" He says if she doesn't get him too drunk at midnight. Later, when Sarah asks Pete if his fiancee is pregnant, he replies, ""She's working on it."" In one scene Pete tells his single daughter acting as surrogate, and his son-in-law, the baby's father, about a time when he and Sarah went skinny-dipping even when there was a ""No Swimming Allowed"" sign posted. He related that to the courage it took for them to ""break the rules"" with a surrogate birth. It also seemed that there was a clumsy edit job where Pete was asking his youngest daughter's boyfriend if he smoked and it appears that ""pot"" was almost edited out. The young man admits that he does sometimes. In talking about the holidays, the youngest daughter laments, ""First you find out there's no Santa Claus..."" while the other one chimes is, ""then you find out there's no father."" There is a lot of action that takes place toward the end of the movie around the pregnant daughter in labor. She isn't screaming and yelling, but she is obviously in pain.
I like Ladd and Bostwick and I think the daughters were well played. There are some clever lines and humorous situations, but there are also some things about the script that bothered me. Sarah was a little too understanding and long-suffering and there were some situations that didn't feel realistic to me at all. I won't try to list them. That said, it was an interesting story and held my attention, but I am old fashioned enough that I like my movies to have people get married before they start living together and ""making babies.""",1321228800,19,4184,4.58611481975968
4670273,5,B005F0TH7W,"We showed Holiday Baggage at Spruce Point Assisted Living in Florence, Oregon, and at Willamette Oaks Retirement Apartments in Eugene, Oregon. Everyone loved it and these folks are ""picky."" I also was privileged to read and critique the first scripts sent to me by Catherine Rubey, the writer and executive producer. I was excited about Holiday Baggage then and am most impressed with the final product. You'll love it too.",1320537600,27,423,5.057142857142857
4670274,5,B005F0TH7W,"I saw this film for the first time last Christmas and was instantly hooked.  It has just been released on DVD and I felt that I had to add it to my collection.  This is an excellent story of an estranged family that comes together during a seeming tragedy and reconnects to become a family again.  Barry Bostwick is excellent as the patriarch who cheated and lost his family over his indiscretions, and finally as he is preparing to remarry a much younger woman, realizes just what he had and has a change of heart and humbles himself and is able to reestablish a relationship with his former wife and children.  This movie is, in my opinion, a classic.  I highly recommend this film.",1319932800,56,684,4.483870967741935

4670310,5,B005F0TH7W,"Baggage ... we all accumulate some along the way of life.  The trick is to know which pieces are worth carrying and which need to be left by the wayside.  That takes wisdom and discernment.  Sometimes it takes a hefty jolt of reality before said wisdom or discernment can kick in.

Pete was carrying a whole lot of baggage in the form of a soon-to-be ex-wife, one sad daughter who is pregnant, one angry daughter whose wedding he did not attend and a soon-to-be new wife near his daughter's age.  Then along comes a heart attack, right after he informs his wife he is remarrying and hands her divorce papers to sign.  Since Pete refuses to stay in the hospital where he belongs, his doctor wife, Sarah, takes him into her home.

His stay extends through Thanksgiving and Pete begins to feel the tug of his heart, as he remembers holidays past and begins to recognize there is an irreplaceable history here. As Christmas rolls around, an incident occurs that proves to be a pivotal point. It allows his eldest daughter to air her hurt and anger, while his younger daughter reveals her deep sadness.  Pete is convicted and realizes the damage he has caused.  As his youngest daughter is in labor, Pete makes a decision that will change his family's life for the better.

This movie is about realizing when we need to drop some baggage in order to carry the baggage that matters most.  Baggage doesn't have to be something negative.  The baggage Pete ends up carrying are the pieces of his family's history - the family he and Sarah created, nurtured and now can watch grow through a grandparent's eyes.  This baggage is lightweight and valuable.  Enclosed in its interior are memories of love and laughter and hurt and reconciliation and forgiveness.  All the things that make a life worthwhile.

Admitting you made a colossal mistake and asking for forgiveness is not always easy, but when you receive that forgiveness it can change your life.  The domino effect of the father apologizing and the mother's act of forgiveness brings peace and joy to a splintered, hurting family.

Barry Bostwick and Cheryl Ladd are ideal for their roles, displaying emotions realistically.  They also have great on-screen chemistry that makes their love tangible.  This is a wonderful family movie, possibly to be viewed as a holiday tradition.",1410220800,5,2326,4.796482412060302

The mother is a fool for considering taking him back and, although she is supposed to be a hard-working doctor, she is only shown in that role in one scene at the start of the film. The older daughter is whiny and annoying, and I couldn't even get a handle on the younger one. The son-in-law drifts through the film like a zombie. There is only one redeeming and sympathetic character, and he dies...

The basic problem is in the script. It appears to have been written by a guy who wanted to justify his bad behavior. And it fails on all counts.
