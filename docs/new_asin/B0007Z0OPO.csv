8054508,2,B0007Z0OPO,"Have to agree that this one's a clinker. Felt badly for Kenneth Connor,he tried,but this wasn't up to any standard. Great when they shot down the enemy planes,but that's about it.",1418428800,,179,4.806451612903226
8054509,1,B0007Z0OPO,"This is the worst of the 25 movies in the Carry On series.  It is worst by a wide margin.  They repeat a limited number of Three Stooges type gags to fill out the 90 minutes.  If you are not a veteran, you will not appreciate most of the limited humor.  It does not even have the sexual content of most Carry on movies.  The overweight and shapeless women are very bland and wear shapeless uniforms.

There is a serious technical flaw.  The audio is recorded at a very low level.  You will have to turn your television volume to full on to get even a low sound level out of the speakers.",1122508800,10,587,4.132743362831858
