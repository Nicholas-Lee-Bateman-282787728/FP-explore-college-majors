7695674,5,B01D01K5PK,"Awesome video that tells the real story of the L.A. Hard Rock and Metal scene of the 1980's from '81 to '86.  The video features appearances from the huge bands (Metallica, Quiet Riot, Ratt, Dokken etc..) and the bands that never quite made it out of Los Angeles (August Redmoon, Rough Cutt, & Steeler).  This DVD is must for any fan out there that loves Hard Rock and Metal music.  Thank You to Bob Nalbandian for making this and the other Inside Metal DVD's.",1465344000,4,460,4.4523809523809526

7695676,4,B01D01K5PK,Interesting film but it leaves out most of the bands and music that are familiar to the outsiders.,1479168000,,98,4.5

7695678,1,B01D01K5PK,"Wow this was just terrible. I didn't go in expecting much and I got a lot less. Disjointed timeline, what appears to be public domain video and no music to speak of. If you want a documentary watch ""The Fall of Western Civilization Pt. II: The Metal Years"". Don't waste your time on this.

How did they get John Bush to do the commentary?",1476230400,2,338,4.28125

7695680,3,B01D01K5PK,It's a good documentary but it's very very cut and paste. Some of the photos don't really line up too well with the actual stories and the time they are representing. But all in all it's a very enjoyable documentary.,1475971200,,216,4.425

7695685,5,B01D01K5PK,A series that keeps on getting better. A must have for all Rock and Metal fans but especially those who grew up not in the LA area during this time!,1472774400,,148,3.966666666666667

7695687,5,B01D01K5PK,It's a great look into the explosion of metal on to the L.A. music scene. It brings back a lot of memories of bands that I had forgotten like Sound Barrier. What a blast.,1472256000,,170,4.029411764705882

7695689,3,B01D01K5PK,"I bought the first 2 of this series and was really excited to see this. However is is severely lacking in comparison . The film is very disjointed, jumps around a lot. It goes from bands getting signed to the downfall of the scene super quick. Would have really liked more info on the bands that didn't break through or never got signed. Plus having Mike Stone who looks like an extra from a 50's movie running down the scene seemed so put of place. This volume really showed the problems with the series. There is a great story to be told but the editing and direction is frustratingly bad. Plus the ""extras""  are 30 second sound bites that are not special at all.",1470009600,,665,4.362903225806452

7695709,5,B01D01K5PK,Inside Metal The LA Scene explodes is a very well put together documentary that covers the 80s metal scene of the Sunset Strip. The producer went to great lengths to interview many of the key players of the time and compiled many photographs and flyers from the shows of the era. as some one who was a child while this scene was happening I found this documentary to be very educational and a must see/must have for fans of The Los angeles Sunset Strip scene of the 1980's and heavy metal music in general.,1467158400,,506,4.3936170212765955
7695710,5,B01D01K5PK,"Worked with one of the bands as part of their road crew back in the day.  Saw most of these bands in the clubs around O.C., and LA.  It was great to see all of history and good times put together like this.
Great Job Bob!!!",1466985600,,223,3.8260869565217392

7695713,5,B01D01K5PK,The Inside Metal Series should not be missed by any fan of hard rock and metal. The director does a stellar job in capturing the true history of the rise of the L.A. Metal scene by interviewing the artists that were actually part of it and made it happen. This docu-series is superbly done.,1466121600,,290,4.388888888888889
7695714,5,B01D01K5PK,Great overall production.  The interviews are fantastic and lots of insight from so many influential people.  I want to watch it again!,1465862400,,135,5.090909090909091
8754528,3,B01D01K5PK,"The coverage, pictures, and video included are great.  The videos and live footage doesn't have any music or live footage connected with it. It just uses random background music not even tied to the bands.  I'm guessing they didn't want to pay licensing for any of the music from the bands they are covering, so the music for these L.A. and Thrash Metal bands are not included. There are a few random clips of music from these genres here and there, but it's rarely connected to the bands being covered.  This makes these movies hard to watch, although I do enjoy the interviews.  I've watched the ""LA Scene Explodes"" and ""Rise of Thrash Metal"" documentaries tied to this series and they are all the same.",1529539200,,705,4.616
8754529,2,B01D01K5PK,"It feels very homemade and low budget. While some of the info and interviews are good, I can't tell you how disappointing it is not to hear any of the actual bands. I get it music rights are expensive, but you can't do a doc and have artist talking about songs and never play the songs! Some decent interviews but felt the storytelling was sort of all over the place. Start a subject and then go off on a different tangent, then come back to it again. Needed a good editor and producer. The Vo's are well written but they sound like they were recorded on an iPhone. It had the potential to be a really great  doc, some proper producing, some music from the real artist. I grew up a music fan and going to the LA clubs , seeing these bands, such a great time, which the doc presents well. Unfortunately the whole series is produced the same way without any music from the artist. It's really just a bunch of interviews strung together with production music and stock footage",1521072000,,973,4.346153846153846
8754530,5,B01D01K5PK,"Great time capsule on the L.A. metal scene, done well. A lot of cool ads, footage and stories, a must for any collector",1514419200,,119,4.217391304347826

8754534,1,B01D01K5PK,"Worst documentary I've watched ever, boring, a lot of people didn't were much important on the scene and the background music terrible. BORING. They waste much time talking about just a handfull bands",1488585600,,200,5.090909090909091
