1817617,5,B00007KK3D,"Think of the first time you saw a squirrel in the middle of the road ran over. Now imagine the scene animated. Now imagine another squirrel driving the car that hit the first squirrel. Again, imagine the second squirrel swerving off the road and going half-way up a tree to hit the first squirrel. Blammo! You got yourself into the mood for Happy Tree Friends.
Happy Tree Friends are so cute, so adorable, and so funny that you would want to squeeze thier eyes out, if they don't do it first.",1051056000,3,492,4.417582417582418

So much violence, so much blood and pain. This is a great party DVD, its a little short but worth every penny. Buy this now you won't be dissappointed.

1817635,1,B00007KK3D,"I first saw this series advertised in Viz, the wickedly funny English humor magazine, so I thought it might be worth checking out.  It's not.  You can do so yourself on the happy tree friends web site.

The ""humor"" such as there is, seems to be based on the simple notion of cute little cartoon characters having horrible, horrible things done to them.  That's it.  Once you laugh at the concept the first time, it gets really repetetive and there is no depth beyond that concept.

Think ""Itchy and Scratchy"" but without any pop culture references or connection to a larger world (the Simpsons), and about 10-20 times longer.

Or, to be even more helpful, here is a synopsis of one episode.  Cute woodland creatures are watching cute animal do a magic show.  One of them volunteers to be sawn hin half.  Guess what?!  He really is.  On ambulance ride, other cute animal falls out, pulling mutilated animal's lower torso out on gurney, with inards stringing all over the place.  Ha ha...  In hospital, cute animal is in intensive care, and sewn back together.  Magic show animal feels bad, tries to entertain him by doing more magic.  Does trick that involves pouring fluid into newspaper without getting it wet.  Only fluid available is transfusion IV to maimed animal.  Uses all the blood and maimed animal dies.  The end.  What, not laughing?

The humor is simplistic that it should only appeal to children, yet it should definitely NOT be shown to them.  A paradox!",1108944000,7,1468,4.719367588932807
1817636,5,B00007KK3D,"This sick, twisted stuff is right up my alley!  I was somewhat infamous at my high school for drawing stick men having similar

misadventures, so a few of my old classmates might think I was part of the genius behind the Happy Tree Friends.  I was not, but it does my heart good to see someone cashing in on this insanity!  Handy (who has no hands) really cracks me up because you'll just miss seeing him doing impossible things like building a treehouse or bowling, but now that you are watching him, all of a sudden he's helpless to save himself or his friends from their horrible fate!

Watching this DVD is kinda like watching a medley of Kenny's deaths on South Park.  The ones with Flippy the crazed Vietnam vet even have a slasher movie type feel to them.

Yes, indeed , do NOT buy this DVD for young kids.  It could be very traumatic.  Let them learn on their own what a sick world it is before adding to the distress.",1104105600,3,926,4.30635838150289
1817637,3,B00007KK3D,"OK, first of all...THIS STUFF IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!  Parents, please note that even the cover of the DVD states this.  These are ""adult"" cartoons for the the 18+ crowd.  Got it?  Good!

Now, though these cartoons are great, this particular DVD is a bit of a rip-off.  There are a total of 16 cartoons, each about a minute in length, plus some extras.  But would it have killed Mondo Studios to put everything on one DVD instead of three?  Must they be that greedy?

Back to the cartoons: incredibly violent, truly twisted and screamingly funny.

1817638,1,B00007KK3D,"My son asked for this DVD for Christmas. I didn't know what it was all about, so came on here and to read the reviews. I was stunned. The cover of the DVD looks cute. Thought it was about adorable animals. Went on the happytreefriends.com website and actually watched a couple of episodes. This made me sick to my stomach. It's even worse that they market this trash to young children.

Needless to say I will not be purchasing this for my son. If any parent actually buys this DVD filled with gratuitious violence, then in my opinion, they are totally irresponsible and bordering on bad parents. Allowing a child to view depections of animals getting maimed and tortured is sick. Personally I don't think Amazon should even carry this trash.",1102896000,3,742,4.66412213740458
1817639,5,B00007KK3D,"Happy Tree Friends is a gruesome, bloody, and wildly funny web comic which I am happy has made it to DVD. Follows the misadventures of a variety of characters who inevitable wind up getting murdered, or killed in slow, aggonizing and torturous ways. Laughed till I had tears in my eyes! If you don't like ""Itchy and Scratchy"" you probably won't like this.

As for a fellow reviewer: 'Animation Historian'

You need to relax and chill out.

Saying things like: ""If watching the likes of ""Celebrity Deathmatch"", reading ""Squeak The Mouse"", getting off on seeing roadkill, and seeing intense pain in the face of someone else appeals to you, then you're the type to buy and enjoy this DVD... and get some therapy while you're at it.""

I mean the way to alienate a large amount of people at one time. Seriously, bravo. I'm sure you're the kind of person who thinks people who watch ""That 70's Show"" are potheads, and people who listen to Marlyn Manson and Rob Zombie are devil worshippers. You don't like the show, fine. Then say you don't, but don't include in your review that if anyone else find this DVD funny, they MUST be either sick, or deranged or both.

1817640,1,B00007KK3D,This DVD has a lot of graphic violence. The people who market this DVD did not put a rating on it. It should have an R rating or an ( X or NC-17 rating) so that only people over 17 can watch it. Please do not let children under 17 see this DVD.,1096416000,4,244,3.6226415094339623
1817641,4,B00007KK3D,i love these cartoons because they are just so wrong. so so wrong. the brutal killing of cute cuddly creatures are enough to keep a little kid and a grown adult entertained. the second and third dvds are better because they left out the openning theme song which becomes very annoying by the end of the first dvd. the second dvd has a decent amount of scenes but the third has longer scenes by about a half a minute extra a piece. overall the shock value is worth buying at least one of these dvds so you can scare off some witless relatives you want to be rid of or to please your drunk friends.,1094083200,6,596,4.191304347826087
1817642,1,B00007KK3D,"If you're an indignant, rebellious, and illiterate teenager or a spiteful, unfulfilled, reclusive adult who appreciates blood for sheer shock value then you'll probably enjoy this shlock.

Unlike the hilarious escapades of South Park and the Simpsons' ""Itchy And Scratchy"", these Webtoons severely lack any sort of entertainment substance.. they're nothing but pure, unabashed gruesome violence.  Plunk! there's a brightly-coloured cutesy-poo animal (30 seconds pass) and plunk! there goes some part of its anatomy... no point, no depth, no humour value whatsoever, just lots and lots gore, squealing, and biological sound effects.  Part of the reason that cartoon slapstick is supposed to be funny is that it is violence without pain- and there's plenty of both in these clips.

You could pull the legs off grasshoppers or dissect squirrels to have as much fun as watching this DVD.  If watching the likes of ""Celebrity Deathmatch"", reading ""Squeak The Mouse"", getting off on seeing roadkill, and seeing intense pain in the face of someone else appeals to you, then you're the type to buy and enjoy this DVD... and get some therapy while you're at it.",1094083200,8,1152,5.205405405405405

I recommend this DVD, there is a little redundancy when you go from one skit to another, in that it lags due to the ""intro"" they have on the onset of every skit.",1076284800,3,333,4.203125
1817644,5,B00007KK3D,"I love Happy Tree Friends.  Don't pay attention to some of the negative reviews.  Love them or hate them.

1817645,1,B00007KK3D,"Happy Tree Friends are like Itchy and Scratchy for the even-shorter attention span. With their pastel colors, big round outlines, and situations that would be painfully predictable if they had any story to them at all, the best thing about this series is the infectious theme music. Unfortunately, said theme is missing completely from this DVD.  For the full experience, visit the Happy Tree Friends' website. This is how these cartoons should be viewed, anyway.  At least the Flash will load, there; the copy of the DVD that we viewed was so poorly compressed as to be unwatchable, plus it crashed every computer and component dvd player we played it in.",1073088000,3,656,4.900900900900901

It is not real and they always come back to life for the next eposide. Sure, a cartoon skunk getting his head fried off at the local burger joint by a chipmunk that is having a viet nam flashback is a bit grotesque, but thats why its funny. That is why there is a disclaimer at the bottom of the webpage saying ""not for small children or big babies"" or something like that. This truely is a funny cartoon and good for days when you just want to laugh right now instead of watching an entire hour and a half video.",1070755200,6,623,4.1570247933884295

Basically, there is a cast of adorable characters who just happen to have minor problems - Flippy has Vietnam flashbacks that make him go on killing sprees; Handy is the handyman that has no hands; Lumpy is, well...Lumpy.  Each cartoon is only about a minute long, but it is always fun to watch the different ways the writers of the show come up with to have the characters kill each other off (always purely by accident).  It is just a fun show, NOT FOR KIDS, that you watch when you need your spirits uplifted.",1070064000,4,637,4.610619469026549
1817648,1,B00007KK3D,"This was disappointing on so many levels.
The animals don't even talk or anything, the intro theme song is about as long as the episode, they just bounce around and then get killed, pretty boring stuff.  I don't understand why people get so excited over this.",1068422400,12,259,4.630434782608695
1817649,5,B00007KK3D,"Don't let the charming theme tune fool you. These cartoons are sick! They star the most cutest and cuddly little animals you can imagine but they end up getting killed, tortured and maimed in the most depraved yet ingenius ways. You'll actually be gritting your teeth and looking away when death comes calling. But how can anyone be so mean to animals so cute? Animated or not these guys (especially the Vietnam Vet dude) would make great cuddly toys. Tho one might be tempted to press their faces into a lawnmower after watching this DVD too much.
The DVD is presented in full frame and has a loud, gut wrenching soundtrack that only adds to the sound of tearing flesh (or fur), breaking bones and mutilations. Extras include your own DVD Happy Tree Friend Tamagochi plus commentaries from the creators. Shame it only lasts for half an hour.",1067644800,7,842,4.695945945945946
1817650,5,B00007KK3D,"The juxtaposition (50 cent art word) of ""cute"" with ""gore"" is at this point a well-established, time-honored, and yes, hopelessly cliche concept, running back through the work of Kozik, Ryden, ""Itchy and Scratchy,"" ""Ren and Stimpy,"" and so on.  ""Happy Tree Friends"" is a relatively late arrival.  And yet - it's still hilarious.  How can you ever get tired of watching obnoxiously cute pie-eyed bunnies dismember each other?  The answer is, you probably can't.  Unless of course you are one of those no-fun people who are shocked and appalled by gratuitous comedic brutality, in which case you likely also believe that Marilyn Manson records incite kids to bring guns to school.  But if not, I bet you will enjoy the Happy Tree Friends.  They'll make you feel all warm inside as they saw each other's heads off and rip out each other's spinal cords.

1817653,5,B00007KK3D,"Unlike many of you lucky people reading this review, I do not own a computer.  I must purchase my cds, dvds and etc. over the internet on a Webtv (MSN, ask around).  It does not download movies, music and it does not work half the time.  What Webtv is also incapable of doing is downloading episodes of the Happy Tree Friends from their website.  So when I found out that they were putting episodes on a dvd I went out and got my copy and let me tell you, I was not disappointed.  I found out about these zany little guys from a family member and I was hooked from the start.  The Happy Tree Friends consist of the cutest, cuddliest lil animals you've ever seen.  You then get so sick from their cuteness that you just wish someone would come up and gut them like a fish with a long, sharp hunting knife and then play with their lower intestine, 5 seconds later that's exactly what happens to them.  These lil guys get stabbed, crushed, cut, electricuted, drowned, sufficated, Bar-B-Qed, decapitated, and thrown into a jet engine (I left some stuff out, you know, for the children) all in the name of funny.  And it is, from the time you press play till the end, if your not giving out at least one chuckle, then you sir (or ma'am) do not have a sense of humor.  The dvd includes 14 episodes from the website (about a min. and a half a piece), the very first episode ever made (call it the test run), and a ""never before seen episode"" that you can only get here.  It has 4 ""smoochies"", that's when they get one of the Happy Tree Friend members, puts him or her in a box on your tv screen and then you decide the lil guys fate.  From choking on a carrot to seeing them sneeze their brains out (literally) to suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning to seeing them eat nine eggs then watching as they hatch in their belly and busting out like that thing in the first Alien movie, Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  You get a commentary for most of the episodes from the creators them selves, and as you watch and listen to the commentaries you get to see the ""Storyboard to episode comparisons"".  They have bios on 17 of the Happy Tree Freinds and you can read them all here.  They have a ""Pop Corn Video"" were they take an episode and treat it like VH1's Pop-Up video.  And last but not least, you get to see how some scribbles on a napkin made by some drunk frat guys late one Tuesday night became what is now known as one of the weirdest, wildest, funniest shows on the internet today.  HAPPY TREE FRIENDS, FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY (I'm serious, I showed this dvd to my 5 and 10 year old cousins and either their very sick or have a great sense of humor.)",1060560000,5,2642,4.2730923694779115

The characters range from a cute little chipmunk called Giggles, who puts the vomit in sweetness, to a flying squirrel called Splendid, who you seriously don't want to rescue you, to a pair of raccoons called Lifty and Shifty, who would steal your heart and sell it back to you.
But no matter whether the Happy Tree Friend episode in question features a cuddly rabbit called Cuddles, whose fur really does fly, or an emotionally tattered war veteran bear called Fippy, who flips out at the sound of a woodpecker, the premise is the same - blood always gets spilt in horribly amusing amounts.
Occasionaly, a character will survive the episode. It's usually the character who caused the whole mess in the first place.
If Happy Tree Friends was any less cute, or any less eye-removingly violent, people would probably be up in arms about it. But the authors have somehow managed to get the combination of blood and love just right!

1817658,4,B00007KK3D,"If you like the idea of a totally sick and demented cartoon masquerading as a cute and cuddly children's cartoon, then you may want to check out the Happy Tree Friends.  I was laughing hysterically within minutes of putting in this DVD for the first time.
The DVD includes 16 episodes (14 episodes, plus the original episode, plus a ""bonus"" episode).  However, they are EXTREMELY short.  Each episode runs for about 1 minute.  I watched all 16 in about 20 minutes.  The DVD lists a running time of 140 minutes.  Apparently, they are including all of the ""extras"" in that running time.  Of the remaining 120 minutes, most of it is the Creator's commentary (several of the creators discuss the cartoon as the episodes are played without sound next to images of the original storyboards), as well as a mini-feature where the creators go through a bunch of their earliest sketches of the characters.
In addition, there are 4 ""Smootchies"" on the DVD.  These are take-offs of the ""Tamagoochie"" thingamambobs that were popular for a little while (the little digital pets that kids were supposed to ""take care of"" by pushing buttons to ""feed"" or ""play"" with the pet).  Each ""Smootchie"" features a different Happy Tree Friends character, and each offers 3 buttons that lead to various disturbing deaths for the character in question.  I found this very amusing at first, but the humor was wearing off by the time I finished all three options on the last ""Smootchie"".
All in all, I am glad I purchased this DVD, as the cartoons are hysterical.  However, I am disappointed that there is only 20 minutes worth of actual cartoons, especially since there are a number of Happy Tree Friends episodes that are not on the DVD.  Instead of splitting it up into 2 DVDs so they can charge twice as much, it would have been nice if they had given Volume 1 enough episodes to make it longer than 20 minutes worth.

The bonus features are only worth it for the die hard fans of the show. But I wanna say it's a con when you read on the cover that it has over 2 and half hours on it.... yeah, if you include watching them again with commentary and then re watching it again with story bubble thingies.
