It is a dark and stormy night. A man quietly enters a hotel. The Sheriff arrives to spend the night upstairs. A woman enters and asks for a room. So do a young couple, they get the bridal chamber. A man enters and asks for his $4,000 to be placed in the safe. Later a stranger opens the safe (he spied the combination) and takes the money. Did he leave a clue? The Sheriff sees a man by the open safe. Could a man see the combination from the window? Was it the Polka Dot bandit? Could the wrong man be blamed? The Sheriff finds a shack, beans are cooking. The men of Yucca City talk about the Mason Gang. What can they do? Outside they hear gunshots. ""Please help us!"" There is a chase and shots, men fall into the river. ""What happened?""The rest of the gang rides into town. What will Miss Betty do? Her dead father is carried back to town. Will the wrong man be blamed?

One man offers $100 for each homestead. Can the people make one more attempt to get food and ammunition? Miss Betty overhears the plotters and is kidnapped. One man volunteers to acquire food and ammunition so people can survive. He finds Miss Nathan and learns of the treachery. Can they foil the crooks? Not if they learn of their plans. ""Look, they're coming back!"" They race back to town. The gang shoots at the good guys, but they continue. The gang takes a new route into town along a creek. But another explosion blocks their way. Miss Betty tells the townsmen about the gold in their lands. John Carruthers explains the mistaken identification to the Sheriff. We meet the US Marshal, the man from Sacramento, and his accusations. John and Miss Betty ride off to their future.

This story tells how a town that lacks food and ammunition becomes rich at the end from a valuable mineral buried in their lands. [Its funny no one noticed it before.] This is the classic Western where people are threatened by a gang that seeks to swindle them out of their land. It echoes true events (such as in ""The Banditti of the Plains""). There were other cases. The small businesses and neighborhoods in American cities would soon decay from new shopping malls and suburbs that benefitted big corporations.",1375574400,,2195,4.4825
8012302,5,B0001GH7B8,"George Hayes didn't always look like ""Gabby"" in the early Lone Star Pictures productions from the early 1930s, but he certainly does here in Blue Steel in the role of the mustachioed, chawin' and spittin' sheriff Jake. He is hot on the trail of the Polka Dot Bandit, whose thieving ways are becoming legendary in the area. He thinks he knows who the bad guy is, having seen John Carruthers (John Wayne) messing around behind a recently emptied safe. The two men unexpectedly become partners of a sort, though, when a young lady rides up with a gang of outlaws on her tail. Both men quickly become involved with the travails of the local town, the population of which is without ammunition and almost out of food because of these same outlaws pouncing on every stagecoach that tries to approach with the necessary provisions. One of the town's most upright citizens takes the girl in and generously offers a decent sum of money to those townspeople who choose to leave rather than hang around to starve to death. There's gold in them there ranches, just underneath the topsoil, and a man who owned all of the land could do quite well for himself. Gabby Hayes and John Wayne are a dynamic duo, and the ""surprises"" each man holds back from the other one until the end make for some very interesting and somewhat humorous moments. Blue Steel may be your standard early western from 1934, but it is a most enjoyable movie to watch.",1127520000,3,1426,4.618110236220472
