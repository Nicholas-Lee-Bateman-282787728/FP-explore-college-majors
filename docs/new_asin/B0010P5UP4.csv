8238290,5,B0010P5UP4,"This dvd is just fabulous.  This woman is simply wonderful.  She is a self diagnosed dyke from way back NOT a acceptable lesbian of today.  I LOVED her analogies and political input and its very obvious a philosophy means lots to her to......not just anyone can be a dyke.
I have been out for 30 odd years and can remember days when it was not ok to be too.
BRAVE woman like this got us here now where its just a choice thing NOT reason for prison or firing squad or loss of job or anything tricky.  It still is a firing squad offence in some of the world but some things take a while.....like liberty and freedom to just be yourself.
A huge kia kaha to this gal!
In spirit

8238291,5,B0010P5UP4,"The first time I had the opportunity to interview Kate Clinton, I asked her when she started performing as an out lesbian comic. Her reply: ""Since before lesbians were invented."" Actually, it's been since 1981. So in 2006, Kate hit the road for a 50-city tour in ""It's Come to This!"" And fortunately for fans, it's come to DVD.

Kate even sports a new look for the occasion. ""Since I've gone blonde,"" she says, ""I don't understand half my show. But I'm having a lot more fun!""

In addition to smart political commentary, the show's topics include butch baristas, social anxiety drugs, and the clap-on, clap-off vibrator. And in addition to the live stage performance, catch Kate along with cameos of Lily Tomlin, Melissa Etheridge, Billie Jean King, Marga Gomez, and others on the L-word A-list.",1312934400,,795,4.838235294117647
8238292,4,B0010P5UP4,A nice look at her comedy and history. She haben an continues to be a  major contributor to the lesbian and gay culture. An acute sense of politics and the climate. A very funny woman.,1246060800,,184,4.257142857142857
8238293,5,B0010P5UP4,"When the world gets a little hard, the politics a little frightening that's  when a girl needs a dose of Kate Clinton!!  She'll fire you up, inspire you to be 'Outer' and 'Prouder'than you were before and it comes from a place of love, pride, insight and a passion for spreading the joy of laughter.  I reckon I've already watched this dvd 5 times and I'll watch it many, many more times.  Get it you won't regret it!!",1223510400,,418,4.32051282051282
8238294,4,B0010P5UP4,"While this DVD celebrates Kate Clinton's 25-years of doing stand-up comedy from a lesbian perspective, its humor is broad-based (pun realized afterwards). Almost everyone will be able to relate to this material and will be able to laugh. That includes younger people, for whom I don't think the ""Parental Permission"" label on the cover is quite warranted. There is a little bit of swearing in one segment and some references to Clinton's physical relationships, but this is generally as family-friendly as stand-up comedy gets these days.

Which does not mean it isn't incisive and hip. For example, Clinton satirizes the overload of bells and whistles that now come with what should be our most straightforward utilities. She comments on how she answered her cell phone - and took a picture of her inner ear.

There's also a lot of political commentary, but its more the kind that slips its criticisms under the door rather than crashing them through. For example, Clinton exhorts the audience to be sure to look their best when they step outside. With all the Government's surveillance cameras monitoring our appearance, she reminds ""no big stripes, no plaids.""

This is a well-crafted, thinking person's stand-up act that Clinton apparently changes often to call to account society's latest absurdities.

Her routine is interspersed here with congratulations from celebrities and others whom her pioneering performances inspired to come out of the closet over the last 25 years. Some of these interjected kudos are not as interesting as Clinton's act itself. However, you will want to view this DVD all the way through in order to catch Lily Tomlin's clever, closing rhyming rap testimonial to Clinton's talent.",1215302400,5,1714,5.176895306859206
