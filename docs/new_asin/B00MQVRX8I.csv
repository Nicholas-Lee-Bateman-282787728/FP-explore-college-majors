6600160,5,B00MQVRX8I,"This dvd is very informative it is not a straight up concert. During 2001 the band decided to film themselves throughout the span of damn near 2 years,in the studio,in therapy,James going to rehab. Then you get Jason Newsted and his opinion of things,why he split and a look into his then project/band Echobrain. The session with Lars and Dave Mustaine talking about being kicked out of Metallica. You get alot of in depth stuff that you just don't see in most band dvd's. This would be cool with some live set but you get alot of studio stuff jamming and some extras of them doing a song from the forthcoming album St. Anger. If you want too see the live stuff from this then get the Special version of St. Angdr with a dvd of the band preforming the entire album 1 song at a time in order in the studio(outtakes we didn't get on the Some Kind of Monster dvd) I really have alot of Metallica dvd's(S&M,Cliff Em' All,Live S#it:Binge and Purge,The Music Video s on dvd) I have every album they ever made,even the rare No Life til' Leather EP. I grew up on Metallica my mom loved em so i got into it. Like i said very very informative and in depth. True trials and tribulations of a band,and this band is Metallica so it is insane. There are incredibly tense moments,there are fights and there are feuds. There is great stuff in the dvd with longtime producer playing bass until they found Robert Trujilio from BLS or best k own for Suicidal Tendencies bass player. Let me tell you Jason is a hell of a bass player but Rob brings a new level of energy to the band. I think they made a wise choice with Rob. Great band dvd if your into documentaries or even interested in what went into making the album & furthermore keeping Metallica alive and in motion,making killer albums and kicking a$$ live. Check it out you will not be disappointed. Comes with a second disc loaded with an extra 2-3 hours of deleted scenes from the filming session. Music videos,a release party & performance

6600162,2,B00MQVRX8I,"This overlong, over bearing and over weaning documentary shows two kinds of Metallica sessions. There are the musical sessions that become the ""St. Anger"" album, and the therapy sessions that show the three core members of Metallica as a dysfunctional bunch of puffed up jerks. (Well, maybe not so much Kirk Hammet, who spends most of the movie being quiet.) The problem is, at two hours and twenty minutes, the war between Lars and James gets old, and fast! Had ""Some Kind Of Monster"" delved into more of the creative processes instead of dragging on and on with the endless analysis, this may have been an interesting 90 minute VH1 special. But Noooooo! Apparently those with creative control over this monster decided that every little nose-picking argument had to be preserved for posterity.

There are the occasional interesting moments. These include Lars' Dad telling him that the songs ""don't cut it."" The band plotting to ditch their therapist Dr Phil, and then the therapist guilt tripping the band to keep him on. Lars' comment that the original bassist Cliff Burton might not have made the cut for auditions. You can even almost feel for James as he slams the door on the band, then books himself into rehab. Ditto for Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine, shown confronting Lars about getting dumped by and living in the shadow of Metallica. (Is the Megadeth therapy DVD coming next?)

But frankly, this isn't anywhere near as interesting as it could have been. Both The Ramones' ""End Of The Century"" and Wilco's ""I am Trying To Break Your Heart"" are scads more interesting than the whiny blob that Frankensteined into ""Some Kind Of Monster.""",1421625600,7,1650,4.910394265232975

6600172,4,B00MQVRX8I,"I'll be honest.  I'm not a metal fan, and I struggle to connect with Metallica musically.  So that made this a bit hard to get into.  And the film is arguably too long.

BUT by the end I found myself surprisingly emotional and caught up in the bands psychodrama - guys going through mid-life crises, while trying to hold onto a teenage spirit that fired them up when they started over 20 years earlier.

Making it all comically absurd is their creepy, nerdy therapist/coach who I guess succeeds at getting them through the record, but seems kind of a loony in his own right.

The film covers the whole 2 years of making the album `St. Anger', and it ends up being a pretty damn interesting look into the creative process of a group, the costs of fame and rock and roll, and the desire not to let one's artistic flame go out.

Not as good as it's close companion (and correlative opposite) documentary `Anvil'; these guys are less lovable, and their shtick with each other does get repetitive.  But still, when it was over I felt let into a world very different from what I'd expect, and in some ways as messy and sad as any other dysfunctional family.",1454889600,3,1151,4.447619047619048

6600176,5,B00MQVRX8I,"Love Metallica, and this was a great insight to some of the things the band had to deal with.  You usually don't see this kind of stuff on musician documentaries.  I think this was originally intended to be a bonus DVD with the St. Anger album, but because of the content and the amazing stuff they got with this, it was made into a stand-alone Metallica documentary.

I don't understand why people are bashing Metallica because they aren't as hard and heavy or as thrashy as they used to be in their heyday.  Those people aren't true Metallica fans, as a true fan will stand by the artist for who they are and what they choose to explore or do musically.  Highly worth owning if you are a true Metallica fan and would make a great gift to someone who is as well!",1429920000,7,763,4.3076923076923075

8674105,4,B00MQVRX8I,"RELEASED IN 2004 and directed by Joe Berlinger & Bruce Sinofsky, Some Kind of Monster documents the band Metallica a few months after bassist Jason Newsteds departure wherein the band started the writing/recording sessions for the album that turned out to be ST. ANGER (2003). The movie covers the next couple of years centering on their time in the studio with producer Bob Rock, who fills-in for Newsted on bass, and psychotherapist Phil Towle, a successful performance-enhancing coach, whom they hired for $40,000 a month throughout the recording process. Fragments of concert footage, etc. are mixed into these events, including bass try-outs to replace Newsted in the final act.

This is an interesting documentary from a psychological standpoint, but its hard for fans of the band because its such a brutally honest portrayal of the members as it removes any mystique that was there. The focus isn't on the members being masterful musicians and metal gods on stage (although theres some of that), but rather on them being regular dudes baring it all to the camera. The film was shot 18-20 years after the band began and shot to fame in the 80s, culminating with their ultra-successful self-titled BLACK ALBUM in 1991. Here they are a decade later in total crisis. I cant believe they allowed the footage to be released. What a risk!

Although Phil Towle occasionally utters some stereotypical counselor verbiage (e.g. How do you feel about that?), the members later credited him with saving the band; and I believe it. The biggest problems were James Hetfields control issues & alcoholism, stemming from a tough childhood/adolescence, as well as Lars Ulrichs ego. While these two started the band and are its nucleus, here they're openly at each others throats, ready to scrap the band at any moment, even daring each other to quit. Meek & mild Kirk Hammett (lead guitarist) is pretty much stuck in the middle and tries to keep the peace and some sense of unity.

There are some entertaining bits or cameos with guests, like Metallicas original lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, which is thoroughly interesting but cringe-inducing (Mustaine later complained that the filmmakers edited his scenes down to a few whiny snippets, which portrayed him in the worst light possible). You get to meet the wives & kids of James and Lars. James wife is precious. The last act chronicles the hiring of bassist Robert Trujillo, whos offered a $1 million to join the band right out of the gate (!).

Dont watch this film unless you want to see the awful truth behind a famous bands image and music, as well as a little bit of the awesome truth.

THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 21 minutes.

8674106,5,B00MQVRX8I,"I love Metallica and had just gone to their Dallas concert; I ordered this on our way home and received it 2 days later.  I found it very entertaining and informative.  It made me love the band even more.  I watched it everyday at least twice a day for that first month that I had it - I am a school teacher, so I would go into my classroom to set up for the new school year, put this on my Apple TV and work in my classroom.  I just thought the guys were very real and it allowed me to see them in their real life situations and not just guys on a stage.  It also changed my perception of Jason; he appeared to be a pompous ass (but, I don't know what he went through while with the band); my views of Dave Mustaine stayed the same -  whiny, victim mentality!  Love the band, loved the movie!!! :)",1508025600,,798,3.95

8674109,4,B00MQVRX8I,"I'm not really a Metallica fan, but I ran across this documentary and found it fascinating.  Quite surprising to see a band which projects an image of being so heavy making themselves so vulnerable.  I don't know what their motive was, but kudos to them for showing us that rock stars are real people with real people problems, regardless of their fame and fortune.

Yes, they're fairly self-indulgent and self-absorbed, but it shouldn't be too surprising that people in this category, while being real, fallible, and limited people, are also not ordinary people.  Ordinary people don't wind up living these kinds of lives, it takes someone a bit unique.  In that regard, it's interesting that Kirk Hammett seems a lot more grounded than the others, but then he also studies Buddhism and lives on what appears to be a ranch, so he's not ordinary either.

If you want to see rock stars put on a pedestal and impressing you, this documentary isn't for you.  If you want to see their humanity laid bare, you may find this as fascinating as I did.",1497830400,,1043,4.697802197802198

You don't see Def Leppard act like babies when Rick Allen tore off his arm in an accident. They left it up to him if he wanted to stay and waited for him to get used to playing his customized drum set before going out on tour. I think Metallica sucks baby bottles.
