We can only hope that it will be released on DVD format soon!",1198627200,,281,4.509803921568627
7975833,1,B00007G1UG,"I bought this 4 mini movies from Amazon. What a big mistakes. I should listened to a reviewer (haskpts).  It's not Alyssa Milano, She is not there and the title are different.  Can Amazon people out there to check on this. What in the... that it used her name. Hello, Amazon!!! You can do a better job.  Now I have to pay the shipping cost to return it.  The movies are low budget and too many deleted scenes.  Not worth to own it.  If you are buying it just for Alyssa Milano, make sure it is the right one.  Otherwise, you ended up grabbing and pulling your hair like me.",1143244800,4,573,4.154545454545454

These being - Where Angels Dance, Dead By Dawn, Seaside Seduction and Firing Line. Alyssa's movie ""Deadly Sins"" was released on video tape in 1995 and is now out of print.",1097452800,21,345,4.242424242424242
