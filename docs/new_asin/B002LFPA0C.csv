3945921,5,B002LFPA0C,"Handel's Messiah Rocks, starring MiG Ayesa, LaChanze and J. Robert Spencer, delivers a ground-breaking experience. It infuses a newfound passion and emotion into Handel's Messiah that will captivate people of all ages. The creators pay the utmost respect to the classic work and retain its essence, yet add layers that enrich it.

The powerful trio of stars delivers in every piece. Ayesa demonstrates an impressive range, a beautiful voice, and a stunning ability to convey emotion. LaChanze combines gorgeous vocals and stage presence, and Spencer displays a strong voice and a dramatic edge. Keith Lockhart and members of the Boston Pops are in prime form.

Handel's Messiah Rocks features an ideal pairing of artist with mood and musical style. LaChanze radiates joy, especially with the triumphant and uplifting He'll Come In Glory, and the smooth as honey How Beautiful. J. Robert Spencer raises the intensity level in He Is Fire, joining the soaring electric guitars to make an impact. He performs a powerful He Was Despised that shakes one to the core.

Ayesa reveals an impressive versatility. In the stellar and emotion-packed Behold the Lamb of God, he brings forth an exceptional voice and holds notes for lengthy periods as cascading children's voices join in. The piece surrounds and takes one's breath away, and Ayesa's ability to reach deep inside is amazing. He lets loose in King of Glory, unveiling a license to rock and raising audience participation to a peak before bringing the house down. The first time I watched the DVD, King of Glory instantly became my favorite. More than any other, it honors, connects, and celebrates Messiah's message of joy.

In addition to the stellar performances, the DVD features bonus interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. Handel's Messiah Rocks makes a lasting impression.",1257552000,11,1831,5.217687074829932
3945922,5,B002LFPA0C,"This is an amazing adaptation to a classic, with modern rhythms and excellent singers and instrumentalists. The use of guitar with the Boston Pops was incredible and Jason Howland has done a masterful job of putting new life into Handel's composition.",1257379200,4,251,5.146341463414634
3945923,5,B002LFPA0C,"Handel's Messiah was born in the 18th century movement called pietism, which seeks to place a personal devotion to God before ritual observance.  Handel took his work out of the church and brought it to the theatre audience of his day. In Handel's Messiah Rocks, the socially conscience wing of rock has found a commonality with the gospel message of faith, love and peace.  The nations rage but Christ lives and He lives in us and will change us and the world.  Members of the Boston Pops are joined with three rocking soloists, electric guitars and bass, a keyboard, a drum set, a children's choir, a university choir and performed for and with a multi-generational audience.  More than a fusion of music genres, this performance is true to Handel's intent and relaunches his work for 21st century America.  Before spending any money on a motivational speaker, see Handel's Messiah Rocks.",1255824000,6,890,4.906666666666666
3945924,5,B002LFPA0C,"I saw this magnificent performance live, and I must say that I am so glad that I also bought the DVD.  It is an amazing production, both from a music point of view and from a visual point of view.  The editing is spot on, and while it was wonderful to experience this live, seeing it on DVD, with all the camera angles and close ups, was just as fantastic.  The cast, MiG Ayesa, La Chance, and J. Robert Spencer, were all awesome.  I was especially blown away by the energy, magic, and beauty projected by the tenor, MiG Ayesa.  I highly recommend the DVD over the CD, as the visual adds so much to the enjoyment of the production.  I can only hope that the tour will come to a city nearby.  This DVD is a must-buy, the tour is a must-see!",1255219200,3,739,4.125874125874126

8372695,3,B002LFPA0C,"This attempt to modernize Handel's Messiah is nice.  The rewritting of the some of the words took me off guard.  The scene where the children come out dancing was a little disconcerting. They seem to be just jumping and prancing around in odd t-shirts.  My opinion that it could have been a little more organized for them.  It is a shame that this concert seemed to be attended by the average serious music season ticket holder. Older people (and I ""resemble"" my remark!)seemed to be in all the wandering camera shots.  Where were the young people, the younger adults that this would be aimed at?  I'm just sayin' ... Another great attempt to bring old music to a new generation. (i. e. The Swingle Singers, The Young Messiah, Messiah:A Soulful Celebration, Casablanca's Dance Version-Hallelujah! 2000 - [from the 70's] to name a few.),and all the albums by Wendy Carlos - formerly Walter Carlos on synthesizer playing ""Classical"" numbers and I have enjoyed them all!",1319241600,,967,4.865853658536586
8372696,5,B002LFPA0C,"I found out about this performance through PBS - like most everybody here.  I am no stranger to what the original ""Handel's Messiah"" is; in my early teens my grandmother treated all the ladies in our family to a performance of ""Messiah"" at Powell Symphony Hall in St. Louis and later on, as an adult, I purchased a complete recording of ""Messiah.""  ""Messiah"" - in its entirety - is played at our house every Christmas.  This performance of Handel's Messiah - in a distilled, rocked out version - is, IMO, pure excellence.  The three main singers (1 a Tony award winner; 1 a Tony award nominee, and MiG Ayesa already a star on stage already) are excellent, the choruses backing them up are outstanding, the guitarists are awesome, and there is a drum solo in the mix that is just mindblowing.  The orchestra?  The Boston Pops!!!  I thought the staging was excellent and loved the fact that even though there were some really fast tempo rock songs and hot guitars going on, there were also some very slow and moving pieces (I still get goosebumps - even after watching it a few times over the holidays) to balance things out. While ""Handel's Messiah Rocks"" is no substitute for the original, it certainly is worth watching and worth having!!!!! Love it!",1263254400,,1251,4.659090909090909
8372697,1,B002LFPA0C,"This DVD was awful. I got it for my grandson,who is really into classical music,and is an amazing pianist. He's 10, so I thought this DVD might make Handel's Messiah even more appealing. It was so bad that we couldn't even finish listening to it,and in fact, he's trading it in for something else. I was very disappointed. I guess there are certain things that shouldn't be mixed together.",1261785600,2,389,4.6521739130434785
8372698,5,B002LFPA0C,"Not since ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" has anything moved me as much as Handal's Messiah Rocks.  I saw it on PBS and my husband kept saying ""let's donate, this would be nice to have"".  We did donate....but I came running over to amazon and bought as many copies as I could.  It is an amazing production.  So well done and moving.  The performers are amazing as is the Boston Pops.  This is a must have at Christmas or any time of the year.  I just hope that when the production goes on tour that they come to my City.",1260576000,,513,4.173469387755102
8372699,5,B002LFPA0C,"I saw the show on PBS and am so hoping that it comes to my town. I loved the energy in the production and think that LaChanze, MiG Ayesa, and J Robert Spencer are outstanding. I love the band and the choirs used. It is an enjoyable updated Handel's Messiah, very appropriate for the 21st Century. I find myself walking around singing the songs. I think it is a great choice for Christmas gifts, both the DVD and the CD. I know it is playing agin in many PBS markets during the holiday season and think if you are able to see it, you will definitely want to go out and buy it! The Boston Pops and the Audience participation makes this a joyful addition to Holiday music.",1260144000,2,669,4.234375
8372700,5,B002LFPA0C,"After watching this version of Handel's Messiah on PBS, I immediately wanted the dvd.  I ordered it as soon as it was available and really enjoy this rock version.  It is so full of energy.",1258329600,6,189,4.371428571428571
