8667669,5,B00LPHTEZE,"This third set of 26 episodes looks just as good as the other two.  For a long time collectors had to settle for 77 of the 78 cartoons in this series, as that was all that was available through various fan supported places.  No longer!  We have the entire run on nine discs looking as good as they did they day they were first made.  That they are also complete is wonderful as well.  I highly recommend this series, and not just because I wrote a book about it!",1434844800,5,462,4.146067415730337

8667672,5,B00LPHTEZE,"As I write this review Saturday morning cartoons on the major networks are at an end! Cable tv and other formats have taken away from this weekly diversion for our kids! When watching this third and final installment of MARINE BOY I am reminded of this and feel saddened by the loss! Episodes such as THE WHALE BLOWS RAINBOWS with Marine Boy helping a whale defeat a villain who wants to take over the oceans of the world or THE GREAT PLANKTON MENACE in which plankton grows to enormous size and it takes whales to defeat it with their enormous appetites show the kind of environmental messages the show used.

THE VANISHING VESSAL has an ocean liner teleported to a hidden location along with little Cli Cli and he helps Marine Boy defeat the scientist who wants to shape the world to his thinking by teleporting the weapons of the world to his location! In LAND OF THE STRANGE VIKINGS a viking queen dominates a village of vikings until Marine Boy liberates them by making their prophecy of the firing of the rockets above the waters come true!

And on disc three AVENGER OF THE SEA has an ancient whale that protects the fish of the sea from being exploited by an aquarium captian and THE SECRET OF THE GOLDEN SEAWEED has an adventurer discovering hidden gold in seaweed and Marine Boy keeps the discovery hidden so no one will invade the hidden world!  While these plots are somewhat restricted by saturday morning standards they still succeed to be imagginatve and fun! Peter Fernandez and Corrine Orr, who voiced Speed Racer and Trixee, voice MARINE BOY's characters and as Marine Boy, Corrine Orr voices him with a brave bravado! Saturday morning can live on in our memories on dvd! Yay for MARINE BOY on all 3 dvd collections!",1414886400,7,1734,4.623376623376624
8667673,5,B00LPHTEZE,"The final installment of a great animated series from the past.  All the Marine Boy series episodes are fun and funny but in this final third season selection the music shines bright.  I enjoyed the almost jazz like compositions that grace this final 3rd season.  Marine Boy episodes actually made me care about the characters when I was a kid.  Being autistic my understanding of human emotions was very basic and one dimensional but, learning to care about things outside my world was a major step forward for me.  For me caring about things outside my world was very much a learned experience.

The animation in Season 3 is good but not great rated by me as a 7 on a scale of ten in video quality.  Sound is a 7 out of possible scale of ten making this 3rd season set easily watchable.  Some of the video is dim and sometimes the color is intermittently muddy.  These are not cut up hacked up bootlegs.  You get complete episodes.  Marine Boy Season 3 comes on a DVD R blue disk and some people hate it.  I am happy just to have awesome Marine Boy episodes in my collection.  The DVD R disks play well in all my systems.  Larger Sceen TV's 55 inches and above bring out more video quality issues.

I'm happy with my Marine Boy Season 3 purchase and highly rate and reccomend this to all who enjoy or enjoyed watching Marine Boy.  I'm over 50 today and just watching Marine Boy takes me back to 1970's after school when I rane home to watch Marine Boy.  This Marine Boy Season 3 DVD set proved to me that the simple joys of life were indeed by far best.",1408924800,9,1555,4.3068965517241375
