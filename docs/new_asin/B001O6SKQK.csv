3729112,5,B001O6SKQK,I love this series and how they add a documentary at the end to educate us on those who lived for Jesus.  The Richard Wurmbrand story is a wonderful part of the series and is a great way to learn about the man who began The Voice of the Martyrs.,1365811200,,245,3.9
3729113,5,B001O6SKQK,"We have several of Torchlighter's other dvds. We like them because they present children with the stories of true 'hero's'.
Each dvd aslo has a documentary background on the story. What a great resource. Every time I watch one of these with my children I am reminded at how faithful God is even to those who have suffered and lost their lives. What a great source of encouragement and history.

I also feel that these are well made.",1359676800,,432,4.538461538461538
3729114,5,B001O6SKQK,"The Torchlighters series has done an admirable and in my opinion surprisingly high quality job of adapting the stories of Christian heroes into cartoons for younger viewers (although adults such as myself can also find them enjoyable).

This particular volume covers the story of Richard Wurmbrand, a Rumanian pastor imprisoned by the Communist government for his outspoken Christian beliefs.  He later moved to the United States and founded the Voice of the Martyrs, a charity organization which assists persecuted believers around the globe.  I have read several of Wurmbrand's books which can be quite graphic in their descriptions of persectuion that he and others endured.  Could his story be made appropriate for children without losing the intensity of its emotional and spiritual impact? This film answered my question as yes.

The animation is well done although the Gladys Alward Torchlighters DVD may have been even better in that regard.  The musical score is nicely done and the story itself is inspiring.  In particular I like the scene in which Wurmbrand stands up for Christ at a religious gathering organized by the government (this was a real incident in his life).  The persecution scenes are handled well and are age appropriate (it is clear Wurmbrand is tortured without actually showing very much; more mature audiences can read his books to find out just how cruel the Rumanian secret police actually were).  The DVD includes several special features including a documentary which interviews Wurmbrand's son.  The DVD has English and Spanish languages along with English, Spanish, and Rumanian subtitles.  I highly recommend it.

I also recommend several other of the Torchlighter DVDs (I have not seen all of the series so I will only note those episodes I have seen).

Gladys Alward--missionary in China (excellent)

Perpetua--Roman martyr (excellent; perhaps the most emotional one of the series I have watched)

Jim Elliot--Missionary martyred in Equador in 1956; known from the book ""Through Gates of Splendor"" written by his widow (excellent)

Eric Liddell--olympic runner and later missionary in China who was portrayed in the film ""Chariots of Fire"" (very good episode)

William Booth--founder of the Salvation Army (excellent DVD)

William Tyndale--16th century Bible translator and martyr (excellent DVD)

Amy Carmichael--missionary in India in the early 20th century known for rescuing children from temple enslavement (excellent DVD)",1355011200,,2468,5.4136125654450264
3729115,4,B001O6SKQK,Great for kids and adults. What a life Richard led. This is a great story of the sacrifices Richard had to endure because he believed.,1353196800,,134,4.4
3729116,5,B001O6SKQK,"I'm a teenage girl - not a kid - and this is the second Torchlighters DVD I've watched (I also watched the Perpetua one). I love both of them - they are extremely good at storytelling in an intriguing, emotional, and incredibly moving. It's a story of truly unshakable faith that would not fail even in the face of torture, solitary confinement, etc. It was just unbelievable. It was an awesome story. Even though they don't directly depict any torture or anything like that, a story of this nature obviously might scare little children, so just make sure your children are ready for it. It's a story of being totally unafraid and bold for the sake of Christ and His gospel. It's very convicting. It also contains many special features, including a 50 minute documentary that tells of the Richard and Sabina (his wife) Wurmbrand's entire biography. They never stopped working for Christ, before and after the cartoon's events! It's AMAZING!! The documentary is absolutely brilliant and wonderful - the cartoon is absolutely brilliant and complete by itself, but the documentary also adds a lot. I highly, highly recommend you watch this DVD!

The only flaw of this is...wellll, the animation isn't the best, to be honest. It's good, but not great. Overall, it's still amazing storytelling, and usually very emotional. There were at least of couple of narmy moments (moments where it should've been emotional, but it was slightly silly - in this case, because of bad animation), but they weren't often. However, to be honest, it's still superb overall. I highly, highly recommend it. Seriously, I'm not kidding. Get it. It's exciting, convicting and amazing.

One other good thing about this cartoon is that it shows a plain and simple truth that is often ignored: Communism is diametrically opposed to Christianity. It is EVIL. Communism is intrinsically atheistic (or maybe better put, antitheistic) and they oppose Christianity and Christians and they always have.

Overall, this shows you through an amazing true story that we must, must stand for Christ always and that there will be incredible fruits! Get it! PLEASE!! You will NOT regret it. I cannot even express in words how amazing this story is!!

In Christ,

3729117,5,B001O6SKQK,"Most Christians seem sadly lacking in church history knowledge. This Torchlighter series is great to introduce our children (and adults) to some of the men and women greatly used by God. Richard Wurmbrand died only recently--in 2001, yet his life was one of courage, persecution, and dedication to God. This Romanian pastor was put in prison for daring to speak out against the government trying to force its citizens to accept their beliefs (sound familiar today in America?). In and out of prison, Mr. Wurmbrand continued to preach the truth of God's word. It would be good for all of us to learn more about those who suffered for the same beliefs to which we casually adhere. May we learn from Richard Wurmbrand and hide God's word in our hearts, ready to live and die for the honor and privilege of following Jesus.",1340150400,,819,4.734265734265734
3729118,5,B001O6SKQK,"I have read the books of Richard Wurmbrand and know the truth of this story. This film is done from the viewpoint of his son, Micheal. It is truthful and extremely accurate. The graphics are excellent and each word and picture is as it was. I read Richard Wurmbrand's book, ""Tortured for Christ""  . I also have read ""Hammer and Sickle"" by Micheal his son. I know that the story is true and so grateful that Torchlighters have made a film so deserving their respect. They would be pleased and I am sure the Lord is also. Every child should have a complete set of the Torchlighter films.",1302480000,2,585,4.416666666666667

3729121,5,B001O6SKQK,"The Torchlighters cartoons are nothing short of excellent-- especially the Jim Elliot, Eric Liddel & Gladys Aylward DVD's. I show them to a group of (previously) ""unchurched"" children, of whom many of which have become new believers through Bible story teaching and weekly preaching at an afterschool program in the neighborhood... I have also been keeping these cartoons in heavy rotation and the kids LOVE them. They watch the cartoons over and over again and never get bored. Best of all these cartoons are GOSPEL SATURATED. They have even brought myself, a 20 year young adult, to tears (occasionally) while watching. Praise God! Please keep making these cartoons at all costs! Thank you.",1242691200,7,692,5.132743362831858
