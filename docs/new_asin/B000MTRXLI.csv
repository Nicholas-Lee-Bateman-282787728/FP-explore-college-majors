2749460,5,B000MTRXLI,"Sometimes I wonder what they have in the water in England. First they produced ""Monty Python,"" and now they have ""The Mighty Boosh.""

And while the basic description (two guys have wacky adventures at zoo) sounds like a slightly-out-of-the-ordinary sitcom, the reality is anything but. ""The Mighty Boosh: The Complete Season 1"" is a sitcom drizzled with acid and punched through with the surreal, where the most mundane activities become freakishly bizarre. Lots of raunchy humor, silly puppets, songs and journeys into other realms -- it's a head-trip, and you'll love every second of it.

It takes place in a mildly run-down zoo called ""the Zooniverse,"" run by the deranged manager Bob Fossil (Rich Fulcher) and with the awkward cream-poet Howard Moon (Julian Barratt) and flamboyant wacky Vince Noir (Noel Fielding) working as zookeepers. The bane of Howard and Vince's existence: the evil and sinister owner Bainbridge.

First off, Bob decides to use nude photos of Howard's ""freak"" body to blackmail him into fighting a kangaroo. Probable result: death by disembowelment, especially since Howard is a pathetic boxer, and Vince's attempts to toughen him up aren't quite enough. Will true love for Mrs. Gideon inspire Howard to  victory, or will Vince's magic dust vision (courtesy of the shaman Naboo) reveal the way to kill-a-roo?

And yeah, it gets weirder after that. Way weirder.

Vince and Howard's bizare escapades continue throughout the season: they set out to rescue vanished animals that may have been captured by the evil Bainbridge, venture into the arctic to find the giant sapphire Egg of Mantumbi, seek to save the zoo from destruction by finding the former owner in the Jungle Room, explore the world of authorial fame (involving a wad of bubblegum and a black-magic crocodile), and grapple with the Spirit of Jazz to save an electronica band.

And when the talking ape Bollo is dying, Howard is forced to dress in a gorilla costume to preserve zoo funding -- only to be mistakenly taken when the Grim Reaper comes. Vince is his only hope (if he can stop focusing on his hair). And when the boys have to take Ivan the bear to an animal prison, they run afoul of... the Hitcher.

Few shows revel in the utterly, unapologetically bizarre the way ""The Mighty Boosh"" does -- the entire first season is awash in surreal twists (a tiny techno club for mice), running gags, random musical interludes (including arctic hip-hop) and freakish sight gags (""As the saying goes, you are what you eat... and I'm freakin' cheese!""). Though it has the external trappings of normalcy, there is not a single scene that is not in some way surreal.

Each episode starts with a seemingly normal sitcom dilemma, but then the plot rapidly mutates into a string of strange occurrences, usually with tongue planted so far in cheek that you'll probably never see it again. Even the incomprehensible jokes (why is Howard dressed like Gandalf?) are hilarious. It's also pretty brilliantly written, with countless quotables (""It's impossible to be unhappy in a poncho""), tasteless jokes, and gloriously tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Some say he is the devil himself. Others say he is a man pretending to be the devil with green makeup and special lighting"").

But the crowning touch is Barrett and Fielding. Howard is rather fuddy-duddy, awkward and considers himself artistic, while Vince is dandyish, arrogant and has the attention span of a gnat -- and both actors are brilliant at bringing these guys to life. And Fulcher is horrendously, disgustingly awesome as the offensive zoo manager, who never knows the animal names (""hairy Russian carpet-guy"") and abuses schoolchildren and Howard alike.

Surreal, trippy and utterly bizarre, ""The Mighty Boosh: The Complete Season 1"" is one of those wonderfully bizarre shows doesn't even need a laugh track. I have to kiss you passionately on the mouth!",1243123200,9,3888,5.059375
2749461,5,B000MTRXLI,"A friend of mine who lives in Wales turned me on to this show a couple years ago.  I have seen the Region 2 copies of these discs, and it's about time they make these available stateside.

It's a strange show to try to describe to someone; they love to go off on wild adventures, and they really pack in the surrealism.  It's tempting to ask ""what were they smoking?"", but it's obvious there's much more to the show than meets the eye.  I always tell people that if you look beyond the strange characters, music and stories, it's really about the back and forth rapport between the two main characters, Howard Moon & Vince Noir.  Kind of a trippy Laurel & Hardy, if you will.

Some of the more memorable characters (""I'm Old Gregg!"") come in later seasons, but the first season contains one of my favorite episodes, about an Alice Cooper loving creature made of old bubble gum named Charlie.  A Hubba Bubba nightmare indeed.",1242777600,12,924,4.497005988023952
2749462,5,B000MTRXLI,"I already watch this show everyday online, but it will be great to finally have the dvds to show to my friends.

2749463,5,B000MTRXLI,"Yay! The British don't make a lot of good sitcoms and I find most of their ""humor"" to be cheesy and extremely simple. But the Mighty Boosh is clever, wacky and extremely funny. I don't think there is anything comparable to it on tv in the US right now :)
If you can crack your dvd player to make it play the region 2 dvds, you can buy them all on amazon.co.uk right now!",1239667200,,370,4.013513513513513
2749464,5,B000MTRXLI,"The Boosh has landed! Can I finally say goodbye to the days of searching for underground show clips on Youtube? Will I finally be able to watch entire, uninterrupted episodes of the Boosh on my 42"" plasma? Is this real, or did I accidently take a swig of one of Naboo's elixirs?

The Mighty Boosh is a brilliant, madcap comedy series that almost defies description. Many liken this bizarro U.K. double act to Monty Python. Although the comparison is valid in someways- the Boosh celebrate the absurd with a Pythonish-like relish- the Mighty Boosh is so much more. The series' surreal tone also invites comparisons to H.R. Puffenstuff. I'm not too sure about that, but I do see similarities between the Boosh's menagerie of odd-ball side characters (many played by the principal actors) and many of those from the old Pee Wee's Playhouse Saturday morning kid's series (sans the show's oftentimes annoying namesake). Mix the above with musical numbers and the occasional psychedelic animation and you've got an idea of what a typical Boosh episode has in store for you.

Season one of the Mighty Boosh is set in ""The Zooniverse"". Vince and Howard are two hapless Zookeepers who dream of leaving their thankless jobs at the zoo to form a band. Many strange adventures ensue as the pair stumbles after their dream. The fact that Vince prefers 80's Electro-Pop to Howard's beloved Jazz-Funk fusion tells you a lot about the dynamic between the main characters. Their snappy interchanges of dialogue are reminiscent of Ricky Gervais' work in The Office and Extras.

Season one, on the whole, is not quite as tight as seasons two and three (I was fortunate to have caught all of the show's three seasons worth of episodes on Youtube before the BBC found and pulled them) but this is typical for most series as they strive to find their voice. Still, this first season* is a very promising start to a strange but hilarious series. I can only hope that series two and three are released soon after this first series.

*Bear in mind that the Brits call seasons of a particular program ""series"", and these ""series"" typically include fewer episodes than what Americans call seasons.",1239667200,,2170,4.840970350404312
2749465,5,B000MTRXLI,"FINALLY!!

I have been watching the same tiny Mighty Boosh clips on YouTube for ages and have only ever been able to enjoy a couple episodes when they aired them very rarely on BBC. I've been waiting and waiting for them to put this series out on DVD for US format, and finally my demands have been heard... July can't come soon enough!! I pre-ordered this the second I found out... I hope the sale do amazing, and they put the 2nd and 3rd series out in US format quickly as well. I also hope they put the live DVD out in US format some day... but for now, at least come July, I'll finally have some Mighty Boosh :)

This is the funniest British comedy since Monty Python!!",1239062400,3,673,4.209302325581396
2749466,5,B000MTRXLI,"This show is twisted and downright odd.  The first season isn't as amazing as the later ones, but still worth owning.  If you are a fan of irreverent humor and odd musical numbers thrown into the mix, you will enjoy this show.",1238284800,4,226,4.357142857142857
2749467,5,B000MTRXLI,"The Mighty Boosh has produced some of the funniest stuff I've seen in many years.  Their radio show, the television show, their live shows, it's all insane and creative and brilliant.  Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding have combined an unlikely duo and plopped them in ridiculous situations with some off-the-wall companions and villains, all backed with beautiful artistic sets and costuming and the kind of music you could listen to on your mp3 player.

Buy this set, and all future releases from these guys.  You won't regret it.",1238198400,7,531,5.0
2749468,5,B000MTRXLI,"In my opinion The mighty boosh stands tall amonst the majority of comedy series I have had the pleasure of viewing in the past.

Comedy writers Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding are brilliant, having writing and starring most of the hilarious characters in The mighty Boosh series. Both actors allow their individual personalities to shine through the main characters in the show, Vince Noir and Howard Moon. They base their comedy on the differences in personality between the two characters. Vince being a fashion junky intent on dressing style and Howard Moon being the Jazz Maverick and the supposably wiser of the two. The show revolves around the interests and dissagreements between the two characters and in turn gets them into some sticky situations which plunges them into many different adventures in which they surpass some very random characters, most of which are also played by the two actors. Ranging from The green hitch hiker, the evil jazz demon and the mirror man who looks much like a large ball of talking rubbish, this show delivers endless laughs.

The fact that the show isn't as well known as it should be almost brings a tear to my eye. Because of a lack of funding, the show had to be ended after only the second series, but seriously everyone should be watching this show. Each episode has the ability to spur up conversation and laughter even after viewing time, this being unlike other comedies i have watched in the past.

I give the show a clear 5 stars and a deffinate thumbs up for anybody who has heard about it and is interested in giving it a go.",1196899200,3,1583,4.707581227436823
2749469,5,B000MTRXLI,"If you like your comedy surreal and foolish with a gently twisted edge then look no further and come with us now on a journey through time and space to the world of the Mighty Boosh.

English comedians Noel Fielding and Julian Barrett play Vince Noir and Howard Moon two dreamers working in a zoo (the Zooniverse owned by American Bob Fossil, played by Rich Fulcher) who spend each episode on magical, and often rather silly adventures. Whether thay are arguing about jazz versus electro like two 12 years olds, crossing the arctic tundra to steal a magical emerald or trying to escape from Ape Hell their colourful sets, costumes and fabulously original music numbers (each episode has a musical set piece) will enchant you.

Strange little animations, puppets, men in animal costumes, cheap but effective sets and special effects all add to the charm. It's an innocent charm but an odd one. The comedy is innocently surreal rather than dark.

Beware though - if you like your comedy mainstream and obvious humour, move along. There is nothing for you here...",1172102400,12,1060,4.845303867403315

It was.

If you like wacky, out-of-nowhere comedy, you'll LOVE The Boosh! My favorite episodes from season 1 were ""Killeroo"", ""Bollo"", and ""Charlie""",1248480000,,494,4.358695652173913

Meanwhile there's Adult Swim and Cartoon Network showing regular Boosh episodes and yes, of course You Tube for a Boosh fix whenever necessary.

AND that's not all......the Boosh are coming to the US!  They will be making an appearnace at Comic Con in San Diego July 24th, after first touching down in NY with a scheduled appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon July 22nd!!!!  They'll be back to US.  I'm hoping for an album, a movie on the big screen and a live US tour!!!!!

2749647,5,B000MTRXLI,"Sometimes I wonder what they have in the water in England. First they produced ""Monty Python,"" and now they have ""The Mighty Boosh.""

And while the basic description (two guys have wacky adventures at zoo) sounds like a slightly-out-of-the-ordinary sitcom, the reality is anything but. ""The Mighty Boosh: The Complete Season 1"" is a sitcom drizzled with acid and punched through with the surreal, where the most mundane activities become freakishly bizarre. Lots of raunchy humor, silly puppets, songs and journeys into other realms -- it's a head-trip, and you'll love every second of it.

It takes place in a mildly run-down zoo called ""the Zooniverse,"" run by the deranged manager Bob Fossil (Rich Fulcher) and with the awkward cream-poet Howard Moon (Julian Barratt) and flamboyant wacky Vince Noir (Noel Fielding) working as zookeepers. The bane of Howard and Vince's existence: the evil and sinister owner Bainbridge.

First off, Bob decides to use nude photos of Howard's ""freak"" body to blackmail him into fighting a kangaroo. Probable result: death by disembowelment, especially since Howard is a pathetic boxer, and Vince's attempts to toughen him up aren't quite enough. Will true love for Mrs. Gideon inspire Howard to victory, or will Vince's magic dust vision (courtesy of the shaman Naboo) reveal the way to kill-a-roo?

And yeah, it gets weirder after that. Way weirder.

Vince and Howard's bizare escapades continue throughout the season: they set out to rescue vanished animals that may have been captured by the evil Bainbridge, venture into the arctic to find the giant sapphire Egg of Mantumbi, seek to save the zoo from destruction by finding the former owner in the Jungle Room, explore the world of authorial fame (involving a wad of bubblegum and a black-magic crocodile), and grapple with the Spirit of Jazz to save an electronica band.

And when the talking ape Bollo is dying, Howard is forced to dress in a gorilla costume to preserve zoo funding -- only to be mistakenly taken when the Grim Reaper comes. Vince is his only hope (if he can stop focusing on his hair). And when the boys have to take Ivan the bear to an animal prison, they run afoul of... the Hitcher.

Few shows revel in the utterly, unapologetically bizarre the way ""The Mighty Boosh"" does -- the entire first season is awash in surreal twists (a tiny techno club for mice), running gags, random musical interludes (including arctic hip-hop) and freakish sight gags (""As the saying goes, you are what you eat... and I'm freakin' cheese!""). Though it has the external trappings of normalcy, there is not a single scene that is not in some way surreal.

Each episode starts with a seemingly normal sitcom dilemma, but then the plot rapidly mutates into a string of strange occurrences, usually with tongue planted so far in cheek that you'll probably never see it again. Even the incomprehensible jokes (why is Howard dressed like Gandalf?) are hilarious. It's also pretty brilliantly written, with countless quotables (""It's impossible to be unhappy in a poncho""), tasteless jokes, and gloriously tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Some say he is the devil himself. Others say he is a man pretending to be the devil with green makeup and special lighting"").

But the crowning touch is Barrett and Fielding. Howard is rather fuddy-duddy, awkward and considers himself artistic, while Vince is dandyish, arrogant and has the attention span of a gnat -- and both actors are brilliant at bringing these guys to life. And Fulcher is horrendously, disgustingly awesome as the offensive zoo manager, who never knows the animal names (""hairy Russian carpet-guy"") and abuses schoolchildren and Howard alike.

Surreal, trippy and utterly bizarre, ""The Mighty Boosh: The Complete Season 1"" is one of those wonderfully bizarre shows doesn't even need a laugh track. I have to kiss you passionately on the mouth!",1244764800,2,3887,5.059375

If you have not seen the Mighty Boosh before, look it up on you tube, you will soon find your self on a journey through time and space and will hypnotically be sucked into the world of BOOSH!

Ps. NABOO IS AWESOME! He is a quiet and subtly funny character, very relaxed and charming. Everyone tends to focus on Vince or Howard but Naboo is really one of my favorite characters!!",1243555200,,624,4.243697478991597
