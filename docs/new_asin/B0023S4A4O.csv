3841932,5,B0023S4A4O,My 2nd favorite show is in the little garden arc. This was a great arc because they all really worked as a team on this one. I was just waiting until they got to drum island with tony tony chopper.,1252972800,,197,3.95
3841933,5,B0023S4A4O,this was amazing with all those milenial dragons and the sickle sickle fruit. I really thought it was amazing when all the dragons came together.,1252108800,,145,4.84
3841934,5,B0023S4A4O,I thought it was really great and creative. I think that a lot of people would like it but i don't think it would be for the whole family.,1252108800,,138,3.793103448275862
3841935,4,B0023S4A4O,"I have to confess a certain approval-factor of the One Piece universe right off the bat.  For a property with the word ""shonen"" right there in its title, the show is surprisingly devoid of the usual formulaic clich&eacute;s that bog down most entries into the genre.  Rather than endless fighting in some mystical tournament, One Piece has absolutely mastered the art of giving fighting fans what they want and blending it with a nice adventure driven plot.  I was hooked immediately.

That said, Season Two, Second Voyage contains episodes 67-78 of the ongoing saga across two discs.  The packaging, as has been the case with the Region 1 releases thus far, consists of two thin packs within an attractive cardboard outer slipcase.  Runtime comes in at 320 minutes and the show wears an appropriate if not slightly conservative TV 14 rating (due to a steady dose of cartoony violence rather than inappropriate language, nudity, or gore).

Language options are standard sub & dub, which means the viewer has the choice of the original Japanese dialog track (stereo) or an English dub (Dolby Digital 5.1) and the option of running English subtitles with either.

Special features consist of textless songs, Funimation trailers, and marathon play option (turns each disc into one continuous episode), and an English staff commentary over episode 67 (note: this last one is not located in the Special Features section but rather in the episode selection.  It is very easy to miss!)

The One Piece Season Two Second Voyage basically consists of two story arcs:  The first of which involves the rescue and attempted return of a vital princess (Vivi) to her home land (and the ensuing pursuit) and the second involves a prehistoric island which just so happens to be home to a pair of dueling ancient giants.  I take that back, there are in fact three story arcs.  The third takes place amidst the other two as a sort of spin-off story devoted entirely to the crew's buddy Coby.

In all honesty, I cannot say that this has been my preferred section of the overall prose but this portion of the grander tale does entertain (including the introduction to the mysterious character Robin who plays a much larger role later on).  I suppose my own disappointment comes from the fact that there isn't a whole lot of oceanic pirating to report nor are our infamous crew's special powers utilized to quite the degree of awesomeness that fans have grown to expect.

Of course this isn't to say that there aren't a steady stream of near-invincible baddies to dispatch, damsels in distress to rescue, or blissful ignorance displayed by the good captain, Monkey D. Luffy, the story just seems to jaunt off on several sidetracks along the way.

Worse still is that this set really ends on a cliffhanger which may or may not be considered a good thing to those of us forced to wait patiently for the next installment to arrive!

Fans of the show will continue to enjoy the unique, washed-out visual style that has become One Piece's staple over time.  The sound work is spot on in both language options with the English dub working just about as well in every aspect as the original Japanese track.

At times it's almost hard to believe that it has been exactly a decade since this collection debuted on Japanese airwaves.  While advances in animation process and technology are undisputable, the charm that made One Piece a gem then is undoubtedly still present now.

In all a must-own collection for those of us who have been taking the voyage thus far (even if it isn't the best mini story arc per se').  The special features are quite nice and the packaging maintains the excellent look and feel of its predecessors.  My only complaint comes in the form of the ending of episode 78 as its inconclusive nature has me anxiously awaiting the next One Piece release.",1251244800,3,3845,4.790909090909091
3841936,4,B0023S4A4O,"One of the inherent problems with attempting professional reviews is that you're forced to keep up with the times.  Sometimes I'm forced to jump fairly late into an established franchise in effort to get reviews published while they're still pertinent.  This was the case of One Piece: Season 2, First Voyage.  Released on June 30th, this is actually the fifty-fourth through sixty-sixth episode of the series and it just so happens to be my first experience!

The twelve episodes contained span a pair of discs packaged within two thin packs (inside a nicely artistic cardboard outer slip sleeve).  Coming in at a runtime of 320 minutes, the show wears a conservative TV 13 rating.  There is no real rough language, nudity, sexual situations, and what little violence does occur is quite cartoony.

Language options are typical sub & dub meaning the choice of original Japanese dialog, English dubbed voice track, and the option of English subtitles under either.

Special features are limited to textless songs and a crop of Funimation trailers on the second disc.

I have to just come out with it- this is really a fantastic show!  I apologize to fans if it sounds like I'm surprised to say this, but in a way, I am.  I've had mixed emotions about many of the shonen titles that the world seems to be amazed with (Dragon Ball Z, Bleach, Law of Ueki and so on).  So naturally the fact that One Piece is marketed as a massive shonen saga coupled to my having decided to finally give it a try at episode 54, the formula was looking pretty bleak.  However, even after considering all of the strikes against it going in, I found Season 2, First Voyage to be an engaging adventure right from the get go, filled with a bubbly, likeable cast and some pretty slick visuals.

Speaking of, the visual style of One Piece is nothing if not unique.  Imagine simple but colorful backgrounds with intentionally washed out lead character models.  The pallet may look pale after viewing any one of a hundred more colorfully intense anime titles but the look of the show is easy to get used to and before long actually becomes comfortably addicting.  In fact the entire feel successfully mimics the theme of the wickedly cool treasure maps that adorn the interior of each of the two thin packs.

For those wondering what's unique about this installment, our young band of pirates finds themselves on a mission toward the Grand Line only to encounter a strange little shipwrecked girl being heavily pursued by the fleet of marines (8th division).  Before long their paths lead to high jinks on the high seas involving a senile dragon, a yellow frog that's bigger than a house, and a mercenary who looks an awful lot like someone out of a Dr. Suess book.

If I were to attempt to isolate a single factor that makes this show something special I would perhaps site its sense of humor.  The show is funny and not just over-the-top slapstick funny either.  Rather, the dialog that stems from the character interaction is authentic and genuinely witty.  This is one of few shows that I can recommend the English dub track over the usually superior Japanese vocal work.  Not that the Japanese audio does anything to detract from the experience, it's just that the Funimation talent nailed their character roles so spectacularly that missing it would be a shame.  There were several moments where the obscenely obese Commodore had me laughing out loud (a real rarity among shonen titles or anime in general for that matter).

Additionally, while the characters do have some super-human abilities (stretchy bodies, lightening legs, and undullable blades), the show is really more of an adventure than it is a never-ending fighting tournament.

Audio work is really well done and ranks among composer Kouhei Tanaka's better pieces.  The powerful swings in tempo match the bravado of the onscreen action and in case you've been living under a rock, pirate swashbuckling is pretty darn action packed.

In all I would strongly recommend giving One Piece a good once over if you found any entertainment in movies like Pirates of the Caribbean or The Goonies or simply enjoy great characters, swift adventure, and a good laugh.",1246924800,7,4196,4.82122905027933
3841937,4,B0023S4A4O,"This series, brought to us in ""uncut and unedited"" form by Funimation, has been consistently excellent.  They've really gotten into the groove, in terms of cranking these things out.  This 2-disc set is the fifth in the series and brings us into Season 2.  Finally our pirate gang makes it to the fabled Grand Line!  To my surprised, more than half the episodes are ones I'd never seen before -- they'd been completely skipped over in the wretched 4kidz version shown on Cartoon Network.

Even better, this set ends on one of my favorite battles from the series: the first encounter with Baroque Works.  It's a chaotic fracas with mistaken identities, bizarre characters, fratricide and squabbling, loyalty and sacrifice, idiocy and opportunism, and plenty of collateral damage.",1246924800,3,778,5.086614173228346
3841938,5,B0023S4A4O,"14 Episodes of pure action and adventure.  You can't go wrong with this Box Set of ""One Piece"".  The show starts off with a little recap of the last episode (which starts a trend with the rest of the episodes, because now they recap the last episode in every episode) in which they state their reasons for going to the Grand Line, than they continue a great adventure.  There are more bad guys with Devil Fruit powers, and more corrupted Marines then you can handle.  It's a great pirate adventure, and the only thing that stands in your way is the price.  $39.99 seems a little much for only 14 episodes.  This box set extras are not worth the 40 bucks.  Same as all the other Box Sets.  I only contribute the High price to pirates (and not the ""One Piece"" kind) that download this show, rather than buy it.
Over all, this box set does not disappoint.  More action and more adventure.  Get ready because Luffy and his Gang of pirates are coming at you again with an awesome adventure packed into 14 episodes.",1246838400,,1009,4.405405405405405

3841940,4,B0023S4A4O,"AAARRR!!  One Piece fans rejoice as Funimation presents another block of episodes that were almost entirely skipped in the 4Kids version.  The first two episodes of this set focus on a pair of unlikely heroes, Koby (who befriended Luffy at the beginning of the series) and Helmeppo (the spoiled son of former Marine Captain Axe Hand Morgan).  These two are initially stuck doing manual labor at Marine HQ, but are suddenly thrust into an exciting adventure by Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp (Luffy's grandpa).  We return to Luffy's crew as they arrive at Little Garden Island, a ""lost world"" full of prehistoric creatures, a couple of duelling giants (Dorry and Broggy), and more trouble from the Baroque Works.  Mr. 5, Ms. Valentine's Day, and the Unluckies return for a rematch.  Mr. 3 and his partner, Ms. Goldenweek, also arrive and display their own terrifying powers.  Finally, we hear from the Baroque Works head honcho (Sir Crocodile) himself!  Luffy and Co. figure that they better hurry to Vivi's kingdom before Crocodile takes over.  But a new problem rears its ugly head as Nami is stricken with a mysterious fever.  In search of a doctor, the Straw Hats arrive at Drum Island, where they will encounter a new enemy (Wapol) and a new crewmate (Tony Tony Chopper).  Stay tuned for Season 2 Voyage 3; it will be great!",1246147200,6,1325,4.81858407079646
3841941,4,B0023S4A4O,"For those of you who watched only the 4Kids version of One Piece, then here is the first significant block of episodes that you missed.  The first eight episodes of this set, the Battleship Island arc, was completely skipped by 4Kids.  It centers around a young girl named Apis who thanks to eating a Devil Fruit has befriended a dragon.  Marine Admiral Nelson (and also a band of pirates, I believe) are after Apis and the dragon and it's up to Luffy and his crew to protect them.  The next two episodes were also mostly skipped by 4Kids and involve the Straw Hats being swallowed by a whale and meeting a hermit who teaches Nami to navigate through the Grand Line (compasses are useless).  The final four episodes should be familiar as Luffy and Co. arrive at the town of Whiskey Peak, where they first meet Princess Nefertari Vivi and the Baroque Works criminal organization (both will be the primary focus of the series for most of the following 70 or so episodes).
Can't hardly wait for Season 2 Second Voyage, which will also feature mainly episodes skipped by 4Kids (a short story involving Luffy's friend Koby, Axe Hand Morgan's spoiled son Helmeppo, and Marine Admiral Monkey D. Garp who just happens to be Luffy's grandfather; encounters with the Baroque Works agents and a pair of dueling giants on prehistoric Little Garden Island; and possibly the first appearances of Luffy's big brother Ace and Luffy's next crewmate, Tony Tony Chopper the talking reindeer.",1244073600,2,1472,4.8023715415019765

3841955,4,B0023S4A4O,"Well, okay, technically, they reached the Grand Line in the last set, but here things really kick off. We're still in the middle of the Whiskey Peak Arc, but we're also at the start of the first ""Mega Arc"": Vivi's Arc or the Baroque Works Arc. The Strawhat Crew pick up Vivi, a run away princess, and agree to take her back to her home before an evil organization, Baroque Works, destroys her kingdom.

This also contains Koby's Arc. This is not Filler, I swear! We cut away from the Strawhat Crew and peek in on Koby and Helmeppo who are training as Marines. You'll remember Koby from the start of One Piece, and he's determined to impress his superior officers.

Back with the Strawhats, we get the Little Garden Arc, an island inhabited by dinosaurs, and more of Baroque Work's agents trying to kill Vivi. The Grand Line is a place filled with people with unique powers, and few things illustrate that better than this set.

This is a fun stretch of episodes of One Piece in ""Action Mode."" Wait until next time when we shift gears back to ""Heart Mode.""",1282176000,,1055,4.484375
3841956,3,B0023S4A4O,"This two disk set contains the Apis Arc, also known as ""The Dragon"" Arc or ""Warship Island"" Arc, and it's the first major Filler Arc in One Piece.

What is ""Filler?"" a few of you might ask. Filler is a necessary evil. Most Anime is adapted from on-going Manga, Japanese comic books, and in order to keep the Anime from surpassing the Manga, Filler Arcs have to be added to the Anime. Most anime fans cringe at thought of Filler material, but I maintain that Filler is not inherently bad. Good Filler exists and I like to call that ""Fluff."" (You'll see me use the term it in other reviews.)

So, how Fluffy is the Apis Arc? Oh, I'd say 62% of mostly good. One Piece is usually great, but for Filler Arcs, they have to pull it back and just be good.

It's an okay story, but it takes so dumb turns sometimes. At the start of the adventure, the Strawhats are ready to head to the Grand Line, when they get sidetracked to help a little girl named Apis who is being chased by the Marines. What keeps it good is the crew's personalities, they keep the ordinarily slow pace of the arc fresh with their wackiness. For instance, Zoro gets hurt A LOT in these episodes. Plus, they do sorta bond with Apis. The bad part is, the bad Filler creates two plotholes: Luffy can talk to Dragons for no reason, and Zoro can cut Steel. If you can look past that, this arc is okay.

The first disk is entirely Filler. At the start of the second disk, with the Strawhat's entrance to the Grand Line, it goes back to following the source material with the Whiskey Peak Arc. As soon as they land on the Grand Line, the original author didn't waste any time to get back to his unique style of action/comedy and unique perspective. There's lots of action in the last disk. I don't want to say more, but we'll be blasting off into the real adventure in the next volume of One Piece.

Bottom line: Half the episodes are okay, the other half is great. That's obviously not worth the full price when we're getting something so watered down compared to usual. So, get it cheap. Ideally $10-20 including shipping.",1282176000,,2081,4.353092783505154

3841958,5,B0023S4A4O,"One Piece is a Shonen series, and while most of them tend to burdened by the same cliches. Most Shonen series are long anime series like Dragonball Z, Naruto and Bleach, and seem to get either bogged down with filler episodes or repetitive battles. One Piece's first season was much better paced than it's contemporaries. The series doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't lose your attention. The animation is a little dated, but that doesn't hurt it's entertainment value at all. This season does contain 4 or 5 episodes that could have been trimmed down. Most of the first story arc doesn't add much and could have been chopped down to 2 or 3 episodes. Overall it is excellent and the second story arc is much better. It only contains the beginning part of the next story arc though. I recommend getting season two, second voyage with it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Piece-Season-Two-Second-Voyage/dp/B002BWD75A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Piece: Season Two, Second Voyage</a>",1261872000,,1039,5.624203821656051
