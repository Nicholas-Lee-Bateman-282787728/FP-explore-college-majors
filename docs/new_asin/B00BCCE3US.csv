5577667,5,B00BCCE3US,"First I laughed to tears then marveled at the brilliant complexity of this production! Rolando Villazon's idea and then masterful execution of a comedy within a comedy blended seamlessly without compromising any part of Donizetti's original opera which is a sign of true artistic genius! There just doesn't seem to be any limit to the the things this man's imagination can create to truly entertain and bring opera to the unsuspecting! Again, this was staged as a comedy within a comedy. The first comedy is a 1930's silent film or at least the filming of a film, a ""Spaghetti Western"" being filmed while Donizetti's opera was cleverly woven into the plot due to the character Nemorino- cast as an ""extra"" for the western, continually mistakens the scripted dialogue of the western's actress/heroine for the real world in which he is ardently in love with her and she doesn't care. Everytime the Heroine recites her lines Nemorine  misinterprets the situation and stops the filming with his comedic reactions. The Western's scenery and main characters and the extras of the film production all portray every Wild West cliche you can recall seeing in your childhood: A bank; band of bank robbers, a gold mine, a shoot out on main street with the cowboy and the sheriff, can-can chorus girls in a saloon, a stoic tall Indian in full feathered headdress with tomahawk, a beautiful heroine, an Indian medicine man and a regimen of Union Soldiers. Nemorino (Villazon)'s ""extra"" character in a tongue in cheek tribute to his Mexican heritage is a Mexican peasant complete with poncho, moustache and sombrero. The second comedy is the Donizetti opera itself. On and off the Western set, Nemorino is Donizetti's character Nemorino, the Director is Dulcamara, the Union soldier is Balcore, the Assistant Director plays a much more active role as Giannetta and the chorus are a thoroughly hilarious band of characters that make up the western's extra characters. Between movie shoots the Donizetti comedy plays out while during the movie shoots the western silent film comedy is in full force. Eventually (and deliberately) its hard to tell where one comedy stops and the other begins as the confusion between plots makes for even more delightful laughs and absurdity! It's amazing that all of the recitative and arias fit in so perfectly with the Wild West subplot that none of the songs sounded out of context or awkward at all.  A masterful piece of stagecraft and entertainment! Bravo Villazon! Well done indeed!",1411603200,7,2506,5.021634615384615

8565873,1,B00BCCE3US,"I sat down to compare the two Villazon releases of L'ELISIR D'AMORE early this week, but I was interrupted by an acute attack of ague. I was practically in a coma for twenty-four hours, and I kept seeing arias from the opera, with Villazon grimacing at me, hopping about the stage, singing the same wrong note over and over, like a tormenting demon. When I emerged from my extended nightmare, I went back to the TV room, where the opera was on pause, and when I started it up again it was just as bad in real life as it had been in the dream. If I died and went to that universe, I would not consider it Paradiso, or even Purgatorio. I am a big fan of Ildebrando d'Arcangelo and am so sorry at what Villazon put him through in the second production. In Vienna he looked a little edgy, as if he foresaw what was coming. To think that this is what has come of the legacy of Donizetti, of Caruso (whom my grandfather heard sing this part in Naples in 1901), of Pavarotti (well represented on video and audio) and of La Scola (whom I heard at La Scala in 1988). E cosa semplice: bel canto non ha niente di fare colla brutta figura.",1459296000,2,1127,4.1981566820276495
8565874,5,B00BCCE3US,"I didn't notice any of the reviews comparing the DVD to the blu-ray or any specifically mentioning the blu-ray for that matter.  So I'll just add the that I just received the blu-ray and compared it to the DVD which I already owned.  I clearly saw improved clarity and definition in the picture and sound of the blu-ray over the DVD so I felt it was worth upgrading.  In regard to performance, there are already many excellent reviews.  I''l just add my opinion that this is superb in the acting, staging and singing.  I already own the Pavarotti with Blegen as well as the one with Battle.  Both of these are excellent, but I like this new one with Netrebko and Villazon even better, partially for the improved technical quality, but for the acting and performance as well.  This version I would show to anyone new to opera who I wanted to impress with how wonderful opera can be!",1452556800,2,881,4.50314465408805

8565876,2,B00BCCE3US,"Some of director/star Rolando Villazon's ideas for his reimagined ""L'Elisir d'Amore"" work quite nicely.  The problem is how many there are.  As another reviewer said, there's a lot going on onstage at all times, which makes it very hard for the audience to focus on what's important.  A director's job is to not only direct the actors, but the audience as well.  Where should we look, to what singer should we be paying attention, who's story is this?  These concepts pretty much go out the window when the whole stage is a three-ring circus.

The very conceit of the show is one idea too many.  Not content to set this ""Elixir"" in the American West (an idea that I can see working), Villazon gives us a film being shot about the American West in the American West, with Adina the star and the film actor playing Dulcamara also directing.  The ""joke"" is that Nemorino, a groupie of Adina's, can't distinguish between what's happening in reality and what's part of the film.  He's constantly jumping into frame, trying to save the day, frustrating the director and Adina alike.  This makes the character an even greater idiot than he's usually played (and as usually interpreted by Villazon).  Adding insult to injury is that this Mexican director dresses Nemorino as the stereotypical dumb Mexican peasant, complete with poncho, Cantinflas mustache and ""What's going on?"" expression.

And where again are we supposed to be?  In the accompanying documentary, Villazon references Spaghetti Westerns, so shouldn't we be in Italy?  But no, the script the actors use has an English title, as are the film within the opera's title cards.  And in what era exactly?  We're told that the time is the 1950s, but the film being shot is a...silent movie?  Huh?  Makes no sense whatsoever.  So many conflicting ideas, adding to the general sense that Villazon has no filter whatsoever.

The singers are generally fine, particularly the lovely Miah Persson, who manages to rise above the silliness around her.  Ildebrando D'Arcangelo sings well, as per usual, but is a painfully unfunny Dulcamara/director.  At one point Adina shoots a gun into the air to quiet the crowd around her, and of course a bird plunges from the sky.  (It's just that kind of unimaginative production; you know exactly what's going to happen next...and it does.)  In this case, though, the bird is a buzzard.  Watching D'Arcangelo pick up the bird and wear it like a shawl, ""singing"" through its mouth, mugging up a storm, is excruciating.  And speaking of mugging, there's Villazon himself.  I've always decried the way he plays this role, but here he's on overdrive.  And as good as he sounds, it's an effort now.  He looks uncomfortable, and we feel that way watching him.

Yesterday I saw Laurent Pelly's gorgeous Covent Garden production of this opera, and it's everything Villazon's is not: wise, clever, simple, heartwarming, focused, simple, restrained, emotionally involving, simple.  And did I mention simple?  Pelly has ideas, but they stand alone so they actually mean something.  Villazon, to mix metaphors, throws the kitchen sink at the wall to see what sticks.  And it just ends up crashing to the floor and making a lot of noise.",1421712000,7,3208,4.923507462686567

8565878,2,B00BCCE3US,"A true conceit...I don't mind the reworking at all...take a look at the Flemish Opera ""Fanciulla del West"" to see where this western filming scenario might have sprung from...but the action is SOOO busy, and not an unnecessary and/or intrusive detail can go unnoticed by the camera...a singer can't even leave the stage without bumping into a pole...it's like a collection of everything bad about American racial and artistic cliches during the period of supposed 'silent' film, but the folded poster figures and the appearance of King Kong at the end of the first act (the WORST idea ever) push the period forward, causing a disconnect...Singing is generally good, except for the Belcore, for whom I had to turn up the volume in order to hear.  (If he was supposed to resemble US Grant, epic FAIL!!) The worst technical thing about the DVD is the picture:  grainy to the point of distraction throughout...and I DON'T think it was for antique effect.",1417478400,4,950,4.894409937888199

8565881,2,B00BCCE3US,"I like this opera. I somehow like Villazn directions, even if it's a bit weird. I like most singers (Persson, Villazn, DArcangelo, Mhlemann) and mostly I love Miah Persson's Adina.
But the Blu-Ray sound is awful. The opera, the production, the singers deserve a much better sound mix, color, depth. Sometimes singers are badly drowned out by the orchestra. For some singers (namely sopranos) sound is squeezed into a narrow frequency band, with very unpleasant effect. Maybe microphones didn't work well, or sound settings were off. What happened ?
The result is really poor... too bad, really too bad!",1411862400,8,602,5.090909090909091
