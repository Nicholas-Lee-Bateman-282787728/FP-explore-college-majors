7850899,3,6303575641,"I wanted to like this, but it was jusk ok.  Scenery was nice though!  Prefer the L.S. exercise tapes.",1459555200,,101,4.2631578947368425
7850900,5,6303575641,"I absolutely love this workout. I was in decent shape but started to put some pounds back on. I needed to add something to my waliking routine. I always like Gilad before so tried one of his harder videos. It was just too hard for me personally although I could do most of it. My feet were hurting and so were my knees. I wanted something more low impact. So I orders this video. At my level I was able to do the whole thing right away. Its fun and low impact, so my feet stopped hurting and so did my knees.  I do it 3-4 times a week. Withing 2 weeks weight started melting away. I feel pretty good about how I am looking. My husband notiecd too. Gilad makes it clear to work at your own level and talks you through the whole video. Hawaiian beach scenery is a definitel plus too.",1386892800,,781,4.071428571428571
7850901,5,6303575641,"The New Beginners Workout was great--it got my heart rate up!! Even though it was a little hard to keep up for a beginner like me who is over 60 years old.
However, I would recommend it to anyone-just keep up at your own pace. Gilad is very encouraging to the audience and helps you focus on the task at hand.",1382832000,,309,4.081967213114754
7850902,5,6303575641,"For those who want some aroebic exercise, but cannot do high impact exercises, this is the perfect video.  It is easy to follow and it is low impact.  I have had it for years and when I feel a need to start exercising, I always revert to this video.",1355961600,,249,4.061224489795919
7850903,4,6303575641,"This is the perfect low-impact workout if you are looking to stay in shape without going crazy building a lot of muscle. Gilad is very motivating, and I have achieved very good results over the years. If you are only about 20 lbs overweight and in fairly good shape, you will see results in 2 weeks if you do at least 20 minutes of the tape 4 times a week or more.",1282003200,,364,4.069444444444445
7850904,5,6303575641,"When I started exercising again this past January I remembered how motivating Bodies In Motion with Gilad was way back when I used to be in shape.  Borrowed a couple of his tapes from the library and found this one to be excellent for my new beginner status.  Thought after a few months it might become too easy but I was wrong.  I still work up a decent sweat and have a whole lot of fun doing it.  Yes, it may be a little repetitive but those of us not co-ordinated enough for complicated dancey aerobics find Gilad's workouts fit the bill.  Definitely worth having if you can find a copy.",1112918400,7,591,4.288288288288288
7850905,5,6303575641,"once again Gilad at his best. don't be fooled by the title. beginners and advanced aerobics fans will enjoy this one. Gilad has a way, like a good box of chocolate; of inviting you along for ""just a little more"". just the push we all need. once you get the steps down you are ready to go for a good long time. one of the most enjoyable aerobics tape in my collection. Thank you Gilad",987811200,4,383,4.12
7850906,4,6303575641,"This excercise video is great for beginners, as well as for people who are returning to working out.  It's easy to follow, energetic, and fun! The Hawaiian scenery is beautiful and inspring. This is a good overall workout  since it includes aerobics and toning.",950659200,9,261,4.909090909090909
