2585101,5,B000FTC1GC,"Season 7 of Seinfeld was the last season that they hit it out of the park and was also creator Larry David's season. While the two seasons after this one were very good and offered plenty of great episodes, this was the last one where nearly every episode was very memorable. This season is best known as the season where George would enter the long term engagement with Susan but thankfully this storyline would not go into sugary sweet territory like it would on other sitcoms. The most memorable episode for the casual fan is ""The Soup Nazi"" and while this is a fantastic episode, there are several on the same level, some even on the same disc such as ""The Maestro"" and the ""Hot Tub"", as well as the other discs such as ""The Caddy"", ""The Secret Code"", ""The Rye"", ""The Doll"", and both two-part episodes, ""The Cadillac"" and ""The Bottle Deposit"". Always a memorable character, Kramer became even more ridiculous, performing great scenes as the Movie Phone guy, his banter with both Newman and Jackie Chiles, and the funky scene where he wears the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Like the other discs, the special features are top notch with tons of bloopers and commentaries. All told, Season 7 of Seinfeld is a classic and a must own.",1390003200,9,1235,4.669724770642202

2585120,5,B000FTC1GC,"after purchasing and watching the whole seasons of the series and ""plowing""(watching million times) some of the seasons(seasons 4-9),i came to a definite conclusion that season 7 is the BEST season of the show and the most watchable too.
unlike other seasons,which surely carry some briliant funny moments of their own,in this season every episode is an EPIC with its writing,great moments of laughs,ideas,the actors,the acting, and everything else that an episode can offer to the viewer. this results in that i enjoy watching every and each episode of this season for thousands of times and enjoy it to the fullest every time like i watch it first time-this happens to me only by watching this season cause in other seasons there are always few episodes that are lil bit weak in their whole story lines or only in some of the story line in an episode...
its really easy to get hooked to this season for me.
also in this season,Elaine is actually turning into a REAL WOMAN by all means.
first,she got a brand new feminine look that including a pretty sexy hairdo of a real woman(not that boring wall of hair that ran 6 seasons),an hairdo that started to develope a lil bit in season 6's episode ""the face painter"" but reach its climax in season 7 and continue thru the rest of the seasons. Elaine also have really nice outfits in all the episodes of this season,especially some noteable outfits in ""the sponge"",""the caddy"",and ""the gum"" episode which makes her look like a real sexy woman.
after being a weak,crying baby in season 6(especially in the last episode ""the understudy""),in season 7 Elaine becomes a strong assertive woman that knows what she wants and also a revengeful one in 2 episodes-""the soup nazi"" when she tells jerry assertively to get out of her way when he tries to convince her not to drive the soup nazi out of business with his recipes,and the last scene when she comes to the soup stand and confront the soup nazi,""the wig master"" when the seller from the clothes shop sleep at her house and she discovers that he deceived her by talking on the phone with his boss,she takes out scissors and looks in a vicious revengeful look(i really like that look on her face)at his pony tail and u can guess what she is goin to do...
i really love the new fully developed Elaine character in this season,and she really makes this season for me.
kramer is also gets revengeful in this season,revenging the cable guy in ""the cadillac"" episode-its an interesting side of kramer that unravel in this season.

in addition,one of the genius ideas in the whole show appears in ""the calzone"" episode-Elaine meets a guy that have a genius method(""a dating loophole"") how to date a woman without getting rejected-he makes a bet on dinner with her,which he will eventually lose,and the woman will surely go to that dinner cause its the prize of the bet and isn't considered a date to her this way she won't refuse or reject the guy-this is one great method that can actually be excuted in reality and i was amazed from it lol

in bottom line-this is the #1 season of the show,and season 6 is the #2(cause in season 6 the characters and storylines are not fully developed or deep).i mostly recommend watching season 7 in order to understand why seinfeld is the best show in tv history.
the other seasons have some noteable episodes too,but they don't have awsome episodes in a row like in season 7,which made me(and still making me)watching this season over and over again-thank god its in a dvd format cause if it was in VCR like in old days,the cassettes would be ruined from watching so many times:)",1361577600,2,3605,4.648902821316614

2585143,5,B000FTC1GC,"First aired in 1995-96, season 7 of SEINFELD is often thought of as the pinacle of the show, made at a time when the characters were long since fully formed and being the last season in which co-creator Larry David was directly involved. In my opinion, season 7 also arguably contains the first few signs of the show's gradual demise towards the end, but these are still so far and between that the season, as a whole, still may be regarded as the most memorable, and funniest.

First of all, of course, there's the ""arc"" aspect; though it's evident that the writers strove to make each episode capable of standing alone (with much success), throughout the season we follow George's engagement to Susan, which has its origins in a serious talk (!) between George and Jerry in the first episode, where they both declare that they are ""not men"" and would like to do something more with their lives, but which eventually leaves George more frustrated than ever before. It's interesting to notice how George invariably seems to be the character whose bad decisions and mishaps most visibly drive the show forward in new, unexpected directions; Kramer always has his new things going on, of course, but his projects seldom last for more than one episode at a time (that's part of the point with him and what makes him Kramer). Had the engagement story involved Jerry, Kramer or Elaine, it couldn't have been stretched as far; part of this may be explained with that George is the least sympathetic of the four major characters, but he is also, as many critics and reviewers have pointed out before me, the most versatile and recognizably human of them.

Other than the continuity story, season 7 quite simply offers some of the very very best episodes; I do wonder if it's theoretically possible to possess even a tiny sense of humor and not laugh till it hurts with episodes like ""The Engagement,"" ""The Soup Nazi,"" ""The Seven,"" ""The Cadillac"" and ""The Invitations."" Things like George getting obsessed with the thought of naming his first-born child Seven, and becoming exasperated when someone else steals his idea...it's just so brilliant. Or the whole deal with ""The Rye"" (somehow, you may miss the opening credits of that episode and still sense that it's written by Larry David).

It is true, I think, that season 7, despite all hilarity, provides some moments which come across as a tad ""cartoonish"" if one compares with the earlier seasons. Fortunately, these still involve Kramer and Newman for the most part, such as the former driving the back of a fire-truck. It would become a more serious problem in the last couple of seasons, after Larry David's departure, when such material increasingly revolved around the other, less exaggerated major characters; this is synonymous with virtually every other sitcom, as the creators simply feel a need to go further than before in search for new ideas, and this often affects the credibility of the characters. Even so, the situation is still far from critical in season 7 of SEINFELD, and it has provided me with perhaps more loud laughs than any of the others (though it's hard competition).",1329350400,,3142,4.8472998137802605

A show about nothing - Only a Genius like Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David could pull this off on network TV without a single cuss word. Classic material and a simply incredible cast make this a must see again and again and again.

The packaging is in good condition and we have every reason to believe that the DVDs within are in equally satisfactory shape.  At the time the order was placed, we also ordered other Seinfeld seasons including 1,2 and 4 (we already own Season 3).  Even though we are missing some intermediate seasons (specifically 5 and 6), we will watch those that we have in chronological order.  Needless to say, Season 7 is at the end of the queue. Our DVD viewing time is limited as there are many other tasks and chores for us to attend to. Accordingly it will take a while before the shrink wrap on Season 7 is removed and we are not even able to anticipate when that will be. BTW, we await Season 7 with bated breath. That's because it includes what is perhaps the most talked about Seinfeld show, The Soup Nazi. It is the title of the 116th episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld, which was the 6th episode of the 7th season. It first aired in the United States on November 2, 1995. As we don't have cable or a TV antenna, we can't watch broadcast TV. Our TV monitor is for DVD and Blu-Ray only. We can also use it as a computer monitor, but seldom do.

As the creators promised, Seinfeld is indeed largely ""a show about nothing."" That said, it's often the little daily annoyances, ups and downs that make for the most entertaining stories in our own lives, and it certainly held true for Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer.

Particularly memorable episodes include the two-part ""The Bottle Deposit,"" where Kramer and Newman scheme a plot to make money by cashing in their soda bottles in Michigan, a deranged mechanic (played by Brad Garrett) makes off with Jerry's car, and Elaine struggles to recapture the John F. Kennedy Jr. golf clubs she's supposed to get to her boss but seems to have left in the stolen car. There's also the infamous ""Soup Nazi"" episode, which spawned the classic ""No soup for you!"" line, as the soup store chef belligerently denied any patrons he deemed unworthy of his art.

Like all the other season box sets, Season 7 includes loads of bonus material, such as deleted scenes, inside looks and cast commentaries.

Jerry Seinfeld is not funny!

Oh, I know what you're thinking: Here's  a guy who thinks Seinfeld was unfunny, but his cast was hilarious.

No. At best the rest of the cast was mildly amusing (although Jason Alexander is a talented actor, he is not necessarily hilarious, hence the two stars).

Because, when it comes down to brass tacks, ""Seinfeld"" *was* a ""show about nothing"" -- in every sense of the word:

The contrived semi-plots, with choppy one-liner segments.

The cloying, annoying, ejaculatory bass riffs between shots.

Jerry Seinfeld posing as this hipster: Yeah, right, a hipster with a ridiculous bushy mullet.  At best, Seinfeld was an Upper West Side Jewish version of Jeff Foxworthy.  You want to know why people think Jewish men are smug, metrosexual wimpish know-it-alls?  I submit Jerry Seinfeld as ""Exhibit A.""  If a WASP played a Jew such as Seinfeld, he'd be accused of bigoted racial slurs against the Jewish people. Grating, like fingernails down a chalkboard.

Oh, and speaking of freakish hair-do's:  Is there anyone alive who thinks that Michael Richards as Kramer would even inspire a single chuckle if shorn of that ridiculous Brillo-pad hair?  Within three episodes, he'd have been out of the door, after having been reduced to haranguing black hecklers in the studio audience:  He's a [n-word]! He's a [n-word]!

Pathetic.

And, ""Elaine""?

Puleeze! She makes Gwyneth Paltrow look like Kate Winslet, she is so flat.

Yawn.",1189641600,5,1529,5.04
2585179,5,B000FTC1GC,"Season 7 was arguably Seinfeld's best season. I recently finished watching it straight through, episode-by-episode, and found myself still, a decade and several hundred syndication views later, laughing my head off. The Soup Nazi was just as funny today as he was when the episode aired on November 2, 1995

The season started strong, with Jerry and George realizing that ""we're not men"", that their lives were pathetic, and that they were doomed to live for eternity alone, single, and making silly, meaningless conversation at the coffee shop. George took this to heart, and to everyone's great surprise, asked his ex-girlfriend Susan (""I thought she was a lesbian?"" ""It didn't take"") to marry him. To our greater surprise, she said yes, and when George called his parents to tell them of his engagement, Susan told Estelle that she was very much in love with her son, to which Estelle replied, ""May I ask why?"" It was a clear bell announcing to Seinfeld's fans that their comic timing was still spot on.

And it was. While already having displayed brilliance in past seasons, they seemed to reach their apex here, where the requisite multiple story-lines all tied in together, built off of each other, *made sense*, the end result being a near perfect show. This was a quality the show would lose the very next season.

Jerry didn't begin and end every show with his stand-up, and that was welcome for me. I have never cared for his stand up. I don't think he's funny outside of the TV show. The 4.5 star rating of his final Broadway show demonstrate that others think differently. To each their own.

Looking back, it's hard to imagine that Julia Louise-Dreyfus only walked away with one Emmy win (seven nominations) in nine years. But when you consider just some of her competition over the years: Christine Baranski from Cybill, Lisa Kudrow from Friends, Kristen Johnsen from Third Rock from the Sun, and Lauire Metcalf from Roseanne, it becomes easier to appreciate the difficulty of winning that award when these actresses were portraying such memorable characters.

The extras on this DVD set really make it stand out. The inside looks offer fascinating insight, although the extras weren't captioned or subtitled. Some deleted scenes were better left deleted, while others were stronger and if time wasn't a factor (as it isn't on HBO and Showtime, for example) might have made a stronger show. You'll have to be the judge of that. I didn't listen to the Notes About Nothing. You *really* have to be an in-too-deep Seinfeld fan to watch an episode just to hear actor/writer/director commentary (not that there's anything wrong with that).

Allow me to digress for a moment and step outside the purview of this review. The only thing that hangs over the DVD release (and all Seinfeld DVD releases) and that which mars its perfection is knowing that Jerry Seinfeld's three co-stars had to push and shove to negotiate for residuals for doing the extra material on the DVDs. It's bad enough that they receive only standard Screen Actors Guild residuals for the reruns in syndication, which have netted the three co-stars each roughly $[...] (according to Jason Alexander in 2004). Compare that to the hundreds of millions that their brethren receive for similar work in lesser sitcoms, the five hundred million that Larry David made off the series, and Seinfeld's net worth of $[...] billion dollars. Not that Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld don't deserve the lions share - they created the show, and Larry's contributions to the show were immeasurable. However, without the talents of each individual actor, the fans of Seinfeld wouldn't have had such a marvelous treasure. The show wouldn't have been the same without their unique chemistry. There should have been some parity.",1189209600,,3784,4.951181102362205

I have read where in 8 and 9 they almost become cartoon characters but even in this and in some of the earler seasons anytime someone other than Larry David is the writer that can happen. I think the other writers try to imitate Larry and they get the crazyness and originalty down pretty well but only David new these characters as real people. (I think my favorite seasons are three and four, and David wrote quite a few of those episodes.) Of the four stars they were all great of course. The three guys look a little thicker in particular George. (It may have been the fault of the show for George. It seems like everytime he was in Jerry's apartment this season he was eating and who knows how many takes they went through.) And Elaine's glamour makover makes her seem like a different person. It is as if the actress playing Elaine retired after season six and they hired a model that kind of looked like the original Elaine.

Season 7 of Seinfeld continued to deliver witty and unique storylines and characters that will forever be a part of pop culture.

Since Arrested Development left, there are few sitcoms that are worth watching right now and none of them 1/10th as funny as even the worst Seinfeld episode. I cannot say enough of the absolute brilliance this show conveyed each episode. I got done watching The Gum episode and I never laughed so hard as when Jerry had to wear those THICK eyeglasses and wander around blind, all to fool Lloyd Braun. There are so many classic moments in this season and Im glad I finally bought this set. The extras are incredible, too, from the commentaries to the bloopers and the rest.

2585195,5,B000FTC1GC,"There isn't much to say about this season or this show that hasn't been said already. I like the arc of this season better than season six: the concept of George's engagement hovers omnipresent in the background during the entire season, and I think it works exceptionally well as a comic medium (I am especially enamored with Susan's ultimate departure from the cast.)

Aside from the engagement arc, there are other works of comedy genius here that rival the best of the other seasons. ""The Soup Nazi"" has to be my personal favorite of the season, but ""The Shower Head"" provides the cast with wonderful opportunities for physical comedy (albeit through the unlikely medium of their hair), while ""The Rye"" and ""The Cadillac"" worked sublimely in combination. I found Michael Richard's character (and the Kramer-driven plotpoints) to become a bit more monotonous this season, but that may be due to the contrast with the exceptional characterizations from the other three principals.

Of course there are plenty of extras (I especially like the ""Notes About Nothing"" feature) all of which are worth watching. As always, this is a fabulous show, and should be in the library of any comedy lover.",1180310400,4,1193,4.989949748743719

2585235,5,B000FTC1GC,"Season 7 marked the departure of co-creator Larry David, better known now as the star of his own HBO show, Curb Your Enthusiasm.  The set has a season long story arc that starts with George getting engaged to former flame Susan, and ends with, well, if you don't already know, I'm not going to tell you.

Everyone's seen the episodes so I'll get straight to the features.  There's a pretty good documentary on Larry David and why he chose to leave after this season.  There's also a mash up of all the clips Larry has appeared in throughout his run on the show.  Plus there are some deleted scenes of the real George Steinbrener who was supposed to make an appearance as himself, but they wisely cut him out.  The Inside Looks are interesting as always and makes you appreciate the craft of writing and putting together ideas for a sitcom that's not like any other.

It seems like it took them a little longer to release this season, but overall, the features were worth the wait.  I've discovered one Easter Egg so far.  When you click Episodes on disc 2 (Elaine's disc) Select the silver item in the lost and found box and there's an additional short documentary on the supporting characters of the show and how being on Seinfeld affected their lives and careers.  Overall, a great season of a great show.

On a side note, it dissapoints me that people are tagging this dvd set with words like racist, bigot and boycott.  I realize people aren't going to forget what happened this past year, but I hate to think that it puts that kind of taint on a show that ended its run long before the incident.  Besides, it's not like this is The Michael Richards Show.  Hopefully in the future people will be able to bring up the show Seinfeld without that hanging over it.",1167868800,2,1764,4.4890282131661445

The only negative thing I could say about this season is that the bloopers aren't as good as some of the past seasons have given us. Also, the Seinimation is really dumb. They started that with the 6th season (I think), in which they animate a scene from one of the episodes.",1167696000,2,503,4.28421052631579

And that he was mad that they made a show about him. Seinfeld is by far the most clever Sitcom ever made. They got away with everything that is taboo. And their best show were among topics that many cable channels would have refused to air. However, NBC did it anyway and the show was a hit. I can only imagine if Dave Chappelle had the freedom that Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld had to run the show how good will he had been. Because his first two seasons the most selling ones on DVD.

However, this is about the time when this show was getting dumb and the writers should have quit while they were ahead. They were running out of ideas and the show lacked the simplicity it had in the first five or six seasons. The characters' idosyncrasies were way too exaggerated and the writers were just reaching for gags and most of it is not funny. There was only one flash of what made show a brilliant hit and that was the ""Soup Nazi."" Save yourself the money and quit at season 6 which was the show's last quality episodes.",1164844800,9,645,4.568965517241379
2585242,5,B000FTC1GC,"Yes, the Emmy winning season of Seinfeld was really one of the best, if not the best of them all. Depending on your taste, you'll either apprecciate or despise the real turn in the characters's behavior. Now, they really begin to seem the selfish, egotistical, shallow and manipulative guys they became known for. (to the point of Jerry stealing bread from an old woman, and Kramer leaving Newman alone in the middle of the night, going all the way to George's complete lack of sadness when his fiancee died).

As for the writing, the episodes are simply breathtaking. How could the writers manage to write so many interesting plots and sub-lots, making all them come together at the end? My personal favorite is ""The Wink"", along with ""The Soup Nazi"". In reality, almost all 24 episodes are fantastic, sheer entertainment.",1164758400,10,823,4.878571428571429
2585243,5,B000FTC1GC,"If you're a T.V. Seinfeld fan you will absolutely love the DVD's.  The scenes that are cut to insert commercials by syndicators are restored on the high quality DVD versions.  I grew up in the United States and had always liked the series from television.  I was married while living/working/studying in China in 2002 and bought the DVD's for my wife on our coming to the United States in 2005.  She had never seen Seinfeld before and had never been exposed to this style of humor or the slice of American life that the series presents.  We have watched the DVD's over and over again and they never fail to make us laugh and lift our spirits when we've had a bad day.  We utilize the closed captioning option and it has been a great help for my wife in acquiring an understanding of casual English usage including slang, and idiom.  On a more serious note, owning so many seasons and watching the episodes regularly makes you realize the sad truth that much of American life really is focused on the themes of myopic self-interest presented and ridiculed in this series. I sometimes worry that individuals may actually see the series as a validation of their lack of ethics, morals, and connection with the Creator instead of as a revelation and jabbing at today's inappropriate social dynamics; just as the Archie Bunker/All In the Family series did in the 70's.

The DVD sets include great special features from ""How It Began"" to ""Making a Seinfeld Episode"", deleted scenes, behind the scenes commentary from cast and creators, never-before-seen standup footage of Jerry, original NBC promotional ads and trailers, outtakes and bloopers, and much, much more.  It's obvious that a lot of thought and work went into producing the DVD sets and I can't wait until the remaining seasons come out for sale at Amazon. After all; ""Who wouldn't love Jerry?""

Episodes included in this set are:

Season 7- The Engagement, The Postponement, The Maestro, The Wink, The Hot Tub, The Soup Nazi, The Secret Code, The Pool Guy, The Sponge, The Gum, The Rye, The Caddy, The Seven, The Cadillac (1), The Cadillac (2), The Shower Head, The Doll, The Friars Club, The Wig Master, The Calzone, The Bottle Deposit (1), The Bottle Deposit (2), The Wait Out , The Invitations.",1164412800,18,2254,4.753846153846154

They were never put in place to compete with first-run shows.  With the expanded cable of the 21st century, ""Seinfeld ' is up against  first-run comedys every night. After I give the new guys a chance or two, I still wind up getting more laughs from ""Seinfeld"" shows that I've seen a dozen times or more. The best series ever.

I pre-ordered the Season 7 box set and I plan on enjoying it! Yes I was really disappointed in Michael Richards and think his remarks were unacceptable and unnecessary. I probably will periodically think about his ""racist tirade"" when I see him in these wonderful episodes but I won't boycott a WHOLE show because of one individuals remarks at a moment of rage. This happened many years after season 7 was filmed or even aired so I refuse to punish myself for Richard's recent ridiculously racist rant. Whoooah that's a lot of R's.

This show is awesome and I can watch it a 1000 times. I have bought all the seasons out so far and have watched them all I know at least 20 times each episode. To pick a favorite episode would be very difficult.",1163980800,11,341,3.8857142857142857
2585251,5,B000FTC1GC,"Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis Dreyfus, Jason Alexander and Michael Richards deliver another heavy dose of laughter in ""Seinfeld: The Complete Seventh Season"". ""Seinfeld"" follows the funny misadventures of stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld (Himself) and his close group of eccentric friends going through everyday life in New York City. In this hilarious season, Jerry's thoughtful gift lands his father under investigation for embezzling funds. George proposes to his former girlfriend Susan and desperately tries to postpone the engagement. Elaine adjusts her screening process to find worthy boyfriends when her method of birth control goes off the market. Kramer sues a gourmet coffee franchise over burns he suffered from sneaking hot coffee into a movie theater. ""Seinfeld"" was the popular creation of producer Larry David and stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld. In its seventh season, the NBC comedy sitcom continued to draw big ratings and become the top comedy sitcom on television. The episodes have some fun storylines, terrific humor and memorable recurring secondary characters. The seventh season features such standout episodes as ""The Sponge"", ""The Soup Nazi"" and the two-parter ""The Cadillac"".

Like the previous volumes, Sony puts a lot of effort into ""Seinfeld: The Complete Seventh Season"". All 22 episodes are presented in their original full screen format. The 4-disc box set contains a well enhanced picture quality and a clear 2.0 Dolby Digital sound. The DVD menus are creative and appealing. Among its special features, it includes ""Queen of the Castle"" featurette, interviews with cast members, exclusive stand-up comedy footage, production notes, hilarious outtakes, deleted scenes and audio commentaries by the show's cast and creators on 10 episodes. Overall, ""Seinfeld: The Complete Seventh Season"" gets an ""A"".",1163980800,34,1836,5.628158844765343
2585252,5,B000FTC1GC,My favorite episode in this season is the one where George won't give out his ATM code and Kramer almost figures out what it is. I think I differ with some people on the idea that Seasons 8 and 9 weren't as good though. I thought some of the funniest moments of the entire show's run were in the final two seasons.,1161388800,13,314,4.080645161290323
2585253,5,B000FTC1GC,"This season has my all time favourite episode ""The Soup Nazi"". George Costanza pretty much runs the show in Season 7, really coming into his own. It was by this point that the show barely needed a script, just a basic plot outline in which the great cast could show off their talents. The Marble Rye and Cadillac tie in is funny too. This is certainly Seinfeld at its peak.",1161129600,8,373,4.3428571428571425
2585254,5,B000FTC1GC,"Here we are, almost 11 years after Seinfeld's 7th season first aired, and it's as fresh and as vibrant as ever.

This is Larry David's last season as a producer/writer for the series, and what a ride he gives us as a farewell gift! I think it's fair to say that Seinfeld's 7th year rivals the 4th in the race for Best Season.

It doesn't have the amateurish charme of the first two, neither does it have the great blossoming of all the characters like season 3, nor has it moments of pure genius like in season 4.

But the great merit of this one is that it's as consistently funny as maybe no other season. It feels like watching a single 8 hours episode, and this is just great.

Plus, season 7 has an arc, which is just as huge and ambitious as the one from season 4. Honestly, when George uttered the line ""Will you marry me?"", I was a little worried, but my fears were proven unjustified.

After the pretty outlandish, almost cartoon- like storylines from season 6, I was a little worried that the engagement- storyline wouldn't be taken serious enough, but I was surprised: it was handled with such sensitivity that the result is Seinfeld's most mature, yet hilarious, season. I realised how different this season was going to be right in ""The Engagement"", when George is sitting at the beach, watching other married couples being happy, and I suddenly felt this enormous burst of honest compassion for him. Or when George yells ""Please! I have so little!"" in ""The Seven"".

This refreshing maturity also is the consequence of centering the entire season around George, who is clearly the most complex and developed character.

Jerry always was almost exclusively there to function as a springboard for stories, to sum them up and deliver the terse comedic punch. You base an arc on him, you get exactly the same, only stretched over an entire season. Exactly that was season 4, the creation of the Jerry show was a springboard for all kind of stories.

But basing an arc on George is different. His character is purely based on his psychology, his way of thinking, so putting him in the centerfold very much affects the writing and the storylines. The consequence is that over the course of season 7, his paranoia and cynicism becomes the spirit of the show; and obviously this was so successful that it stayed like this.

And that also meant a return to the down-to-earth tone of seasons 1-4, which is very much a contrast to the sometimes silly edgyness of seasons 6 and parts of season 5.

The difference is that earlier years were about ""nothing"", and season 7 is about ""nothing, the way you see it when you're engaged"". Who could forget the ""worlds colliding"" episode? ""They're KILLING Independent George!""

Of course the other characters are still there and very much alive. Elaine is now working for the J. Peterman catalogue, and Jerry, as usual, is just there to give the storylines a certain drive. His stellar moments are again the face-to-face conversations with George.

Kramer is Kramer, what else can you say? But it's worth noting that his ""action"" storylines are becoming alot more elaborate, like in ""The Secret Code"", where he's becoming a fireman.

Another character change happens with Newman. He used to be there as some sort of device for a ""quick kill"", a sort of comedic sidekick to Kramer or a deus ex machina (like in ""The Raincoats""). Here he's often used as a parody on the godfather or generally a funny fat version of a mafia boss.

Generally, let me say that the writers were at that point very aware that the show was famous for its merciless cynicism and its selfish characters. And they took full advantage of that. The show became snappier than ever. Seinfeld's final two season could have also been as great as season 7, but their fatal mistake was that they had snappiness for the snappiness' sake, but the stories themselves weren't snappy.

When George says ""So what?"" and Jerry answers ""You're right, I forget who I'm talking to"", the show parodises itself.

But season 7 is brilliant, it's Seinfeld's last truly great year, and yadda yadda yadda, make sure you pick it up!",1160611200,40,4120,4.677731673582296
2585255,5,B000FTC1GC,"I would give six stars if I could! This was the first season I have watched, and it was the one that got me loving it. 'The Soup Nazi' episode is one of those episodes people will still be talking about after decades. The catchy phrase ' NO SOUP FOR YOU ' can still be heard on the streets in several different countries. What was already extraodinary, got to a 'out-of-this-world' level. It doesn't matter if you have never watched one single episode, or if you have watched all of them 10 times. You will love them anyway!!!",1160006400,15,526,4.377551020408164
2585256,5,B000FTC1GC,"This is the season to own. It has some of the best episodes. As for Kramer, don't listen to the media hype. What happened was wrong, but it's not a big deal. He's not a racist. It was just some dialogue that went wrong, AT A COMEDY CLUB...like that never happens? Everyone is guilty of offending someone in their life...probably on multiple occasions. I am so sick of these ""perfect"" people in the news business that never have a slip of the tongue. And what about all the black comedians that trash whites in their jokes? If you are sick of this hypocrisy as I am, then buy this DVD. I may buy 2 copies to show my support for Kramer and the show.

This is also Larry Davids last season (check Curb Your Enthusiasm).  The show was better with him behind the wheel.  The two seasons after this one are well worth owning, but you can tell that Larry is gone.",1159920000,7,856,4.271604938271605
2585257,5,B000FTC1GC,"This was a pivotal year for Seinfeld with nearly 34 million viewers tuning in weekly ! This placed Seinfeld in the #2 rating slot of the season. Season Seven has everything from love, engagements, death, secret ATM codes, the soup Nazi, Marisa Tomei and more! This hilarious DVD is packed with all new special features created in partnership of Jerry Seinfeld.

For a show about nothing, this show has many complex plots, sub-plots, and is very well written and put together. Interestingly, until the public caught onto the series, the television critics were responsible for helping to keep it alive. The critics went on and made the series victorious in every category it was eligible for in the 1st Annual American Television Awards. Seinfeld has won a few Emmy Awards, the George Foster Peabody Award in 1992 and more.  Thank God for that because here we are in the 7th Season with many top notch episodes.

Certainly, ""The Soup Nazi"" will go down as an all-time classic in the history of American Television. However they are all great episodes.

Here is a quick episode breakdown:

Oh and just to mention *these episodes are the original (1-2 minutes longer) NBC Network versions, not seen since their original broadcast runs*

Disc One - The Engagement, The postponement, The maestro, The Wink, The Hot Tub, The Soup Nazi

2585273,4,B000FTC1GC,"One possible reason for delaying the release of the rest of the series may be because they are still making bank on syndication rights.
