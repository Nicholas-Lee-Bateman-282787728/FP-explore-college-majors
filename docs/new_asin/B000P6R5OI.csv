8189542,4,B000P6R5OI,"The 1878 wrought iron bow string arch vehicular bridge from Hale, Iowa is moved 25 miles to the entrance of Wapspinicon State Park, Anamosa IA as a pedestrian bridge.  This involves the CH-47 operation, with a little history of heavy lift helicopters and aircraft, plus two cranes to finish the job.

The 1892 Pencoyd iron truss railroad bridge is moved from the River Market area north of downtown Kansas City to the Union Station, to act as a pedestrian bridge over the rail yard tracks to connect with the Freight House District.  This is done by special cranes and trailers.",1373760000,,578,4.76
8189543,5,B000P6R5OI,"""Massive Bridges"" tells the story of two large bridges given new lives after being moved to new locations.  The first was in Iowa - a 130-year-old road bridge no longer able to carry the weight of today's vehicles.  It was moved 56 miles to provide a new foot bridge in an Iowa park.

Army Chinook helicopters from the Iowa National Guard were used to accomplish this, with crews gaining the experience as part of another training mission.  Ground crews had to hook up bridge sections to the hovering Chinooks while underneath in its ""hurricane-wind"" downdraft (about 140 mph).  The Chinook's twin 4,900 h.p. motors strained to maximum power to move the largest single section of the three.

In Kansas City, an 1890 abandoned and rusty railroad bridge was to be moved to a new location, also to serve pedestrians.  The 237' 1840-design bridge weighed 290,000 lbs. and had to be split in half, then transported on 48-wheel trailers.  The railroad traffic was halted for six hours to allow the bridge to be placed onto the trailers and moved away.  Moving through parts of the old downtown then required 100 electricians to take down and replace light fixtures and overhead wiring.",1224460800,,1179,4.855
