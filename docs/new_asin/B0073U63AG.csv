5053579,4,B0073U63AG,"I read about this in the NYTimes story about the two Indo-Canadian hockey broadcasters who've been calling games in Punjabi. I fell in love with them, got up Sunday morning, made pancakes and watched this with my whole family. It is adorable and righteous and funny and makes you want to watch ""Slapshot"" afterward, just for good measure.  In addition to the whole feel-good, underdog theme, there are a lot of more subtle points about race, religion, family, bullying, and men with beautiful long hair....;-)  Ageless Rob Lowe, Rockin' Ludacris, big Bollywood wedding... what DOESN""T this movie have?",1367020800,5,601,5.122448979591836
5053580,2,B0073U63AG,"The problem with this movie isn't that it lacks plot: it's that there are too many plots for the story to ever get going. If you've never seen ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" ""The Bad News Bears,"" ""The Namesake,"" ""Bride and Prejudice,"" ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" ""Drumline,"" ""Goal,"" and ""The Mighty Ducks,"" you might think this movie was unoriginal;: but if you've seen any of these movies (or all of them as I have), you'll instantly wonder why anyone would try to sell this movie. Here's the conceit: Indian kid living in foreign land with traditional parents wants to play the most popular sport of the new country, but parent objects, especially after observing the child's interest in a white person. This is the plot of ""Bend It Like Beckham"" point for point. And it's also half of the plot in ""Breakaway,"" including the championship game being the same day as the big wedding. But wait, there's more. Smart aleck pretty boy meets unattainable, intelligent, and drop dead gorgeous woman whom he pursues cockily and recklessly until he begins to believe the lines he's feeding her; but then adversity rears its head, and the pretty boy is forced to grow up and become a man, which is how he wins the girl's heart in the end. Still hungry for more plot? Just wait, there's more. Angry man with unfulfilled dreams is transformed by his association with a group of loveable underdogs who find the power in teamwork and determination, ultimately resulting in him finding his purpose in life. And if that wasn't enough, there's the lavish Bollywood dance numbers, the unexplained comedy routines of a minor character, cameos rock stars playing themselves, and even the inspiring meeting of an Indian boy and a movie star (okay, no poop in this one). Movies that try to be all things to all people usually end up being nothing to no one, which describes Breakaway to a T.",1362787200,,1858,4.773291925465839
5053581,5,B0073U63AG,"This is a really good and fun movie, with a fairly good plot and lots of laughs.  I loved the fusion of English culture with Indian culture.  The sound track is phenomenal and the young actors, especially Camilla Belle, are wonderful.  This movie is shades of ""Slap Shot"" and I highly recommend it.",1362528000,3,298,4.584905660377358
5053582,5,B0073U63AG,I have watched this movie several times with family and friends.  It's really cute - a feel good movie.  I just wish it had subtitles!,1354924800,,134,4.32
5053583,4,B0073U63AG,"I have just recently seen this movie.  It is a light, fun movie.  But I would have preferred more hockey and a lot move time of Rob Lowe in the movie. Not a great classic like Youngblood was, but a fun family movie.",1352851200,,215,3.9767441860465116
5053584,4,B0073U63AG,"The first time I saw this movie was in Canada. I live in the US and wanting to see it again, couldn't find it in the neighborhood. So, the only place to go and get the DVD is Amazon, I thought. I got it, enjoyed it and the delivery was fast enough. I was very pleased. Thank you Amazon.",1352764800,,286,3.864406779661017
5053585,3,B0073U63AG,"The acting is pretty good but the story is so dumb. A bunch of Sikhs feeling prejudice from whites decide to show they can play with the big boys in some local Toronto rec league decide to form their own Speedy Singhs team. The problem with the movie overall is it can't decide if it wants to be a comedy or not. Honestly, I found much of the humor lame. Even comedian Russell Peters just seems to be doing his schtick in this one.

It has a Bend 'Em Like Beckham feel to it but whereas that movie hit all the notes, this one just seems a little too contrived. There's a gratuitous Rob ""Youngblood"" Lowe who goes from ex-washed up NHLer to Zamboni driver to Sikh team coach. Of course, his daughter (the smokin' cute Camilla Booth) falls for the star of the Speedy Singhs.

Anyway, do I have to go on? You can guess the ending as it's the same as pretty every other sports movie. The stuff on Sikh culture is maybe interesting if you are not Sikh nor live in Canada but to us here it's like whoop-de-freakin'-do, they're Sikh. So what? we played hockey in the street with everyone and maybe life is different on the West Coast than the Centre of the Universe there in Taranna but I've never seen anyone stick a Sikh kid in goal and then proceed to shoot the hockey ball at his turbaned head as a joke. Who does that? What was the point of showing that in the movie?

Ack, it's CBC so what do you expect. The weirdest thing is there are name Bollywood actors in this as well as a music video at the end that has Ludacris in it. Oh, yeah, and the Sikh hockey players meet rapper Drake also when they go clubbing in the movie. In other words it's a cast of thousands.

The extra I enjoyed more as we got to know the actors and how the movie was put together. Now that was worth watching. This movie, on the other hand, is maybe a good TV movie at best.",1344988800,,1849,4.156424581005586
5053586,1,B0073U63AG,"I saw this film on the airplane on way to Canada.  I thought it would be great to share with friends in my village home in France.  It is a great look at the diversity of Canada.  I ordered it when I was in Canada in March.  Unfortunately it arrived in Blue-Ray version.  I didn't know I ordered it that way.  I don't have that system.  I returned the video. When I got back to France I ordered it once again and once again it came in ""Blue-Ray"" version.  Totally useless.  It sits on the shelf beside me because I got frustrated and didn't return it.  So....how to get what you want and not what the system thinks you should have.  I do not want to buy a new DVD player.",1341360000,,671,4.0458015267175576
5053587,5,B0073U63AG,"When I first heard about this film, I didn't know what to make of it, but after watching, I can totally recommend the movie for teen and adult audiences. Rob Lowe turns in a nice performance, Vinay Virmani is especially good and I already knew I'd like comedian Russell Peter's performance!

5053589,3,B0073U63AG,"This was a fun hockey movie that vaguely mirrored Bend It Like Beckham. The main character was fairly likeable as a Canadian Indian trying to make it in the world of hockey despite its father's wishes of focusing on a career. The one thing this movie does well is blend a bit of Bollywood into its Canadian background. This movie won't change your life, but it will keep you entertained.",1474329600,,387,4.542857142857143

5053593,4,B0073U63AG,"Most of the other reviews are spot on - it's actually a good movie (ignore the 1-star reviews). There was a great fusion of multiple cultures (I LOVED THE BHANGRA) and it delves into identity and family and love. Honestly, I had only one small pet peeve in this movie, which is a kiss in the movie. I don't think that kiss should have happened.

CAMILLA BELLE is amazing in this - she's really a great actress. I keep forgetting that because I've seen her in similar roles, but she does quite well. Everyone else is good as well.",1472256000,,529,4.343434343434343

5053613,4,B0073U63AG,"3 1/2 STARS FOR A MOVIE THAT IS NOT TOO FLASHY, NOT HOLLYWOOD, BUT RECOGNIZABLE STARS  --- JUST LIGHT FUN

The strength of this 2011 sports comedy (re-released here on blu ray) is really that it is something different.  Off beat.  I thought it was lots of fun, and funny all the way through.  One might not call it a fall off the chair kind of funny, just mirthful with the Indian style humor pitted against a winter sport Canadian past time.  The early sports action in the first half is not the most choreographed Hollywood style edge of your seat pace.  But the obligatory sports clichs do apply in a good way.  There are also fairly surprising appearances by recognizable actors and cameos by music stars (Drake and Ludacris) who felt the movie worthy of support.  I understand the hockey aspect didn't strike a chord with Indian audiences abroad and this movie didn't do well there.  However, if you go in just looking for light fun, this is a funny and enjoyable film.  Again, don't expect Hollywood.  This is more along the line of understated Canadian cinema with Bollywood flair and the obligatory dance montage,

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Rajveer Singh (Vinay Virmani) is the oldest son in a traditional Sikh Indian family making good in Canada.  However, he has abandoned the traditional beard and turban to be more like the other young men around him.  Instead of dreaming of cricket, he dreams of hockey.  He plays a little pick-up game with his other Sikh buddies at the local rink (much to his father's chagrin).  His non-traditional behavior and misinterpreted lack of enthusiasm is a serous point of conflict with his father.  He is also in line to inherit his uncle's multi-million dollar trucking business but has little aptitude or interest.  He is driven, but wishes to be his own man.  One day he and his hockey buddies come into conflict with the local star ""almost pro"" hockey team called the Hammer Heads as they compete for rink time.  Rajveer is actually quite good and is noticed by a washed up hockey star that once played pro for less than a season.  Dan Winters (Rob Lowe)  agrees to become the coach for this group of guys as they form an all-Sikh hockey teem and enter the prestigious national hockey tournament.  It's a sports movie so you always pretty much know how it's going to go.  A love interest is thrown in as Rajveer meets Dan's younger sister Melissa Winters (Camilla Belle).

Enjoy something different and just don't expect quite the fast pace of Hollywood or the choreography of major sports movies.  It is exciting and it is funny and long as you like the type of movies I have tried to describe.  If you do like a lot of Canadian cinema and a little Bollywood, then you already know what to expect.",1447718400,,2746,4.627329192546584

The fun parts was the conflict with Father and son,The different culture issue, the relationship was in question to the end, the acting was good, and a few surprises along the way that cause to think some. The music score was truly excellent as was the music video at the end was very good. I don't care for rap however I did here, the dancing was very well done also. All in all it is fun, different and just a nice way to get away for 90 minutes.
