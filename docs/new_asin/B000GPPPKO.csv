8133817,4,B000GPPPKO,"This was an art lecture that you could pay tons of money to see at a prestigious art museum.  It is a highbrow work, but it isn't purposely trying to exclude the masses.  You can tell that the lecturer loves her job and wants the audience to enjoy Bourgeois' oeuvre.  The lecturer reads quotes from the artist, but otherwise seems to have her speech memorized.  This is very French.  Bourgeois makes statements like, ""I am trying to be Ren'e DesCartes' daughter"" and ""I was dismayed to learn there were other geometries besides Euclid's.""

I never once heard the lecturer or the artist refer to the work as Dadaist or abstract.  Bourgeois thought spiders were maternal.  That surprises me because if ""Charlotte's Web"" was correct, female spiders die after laying eggs and thus play no role in raising their young.

The lecturer mentions that Bourgeois was the only female student in her art school.  She even mentions a feminist reading of some of the artist's work.  However, I was shocked at how little gender came up.  The struggles of women artists, and even older women artists, were not addressed, if I remember correctly.  Bourgeois' art was incredibly un-feminine, very opposite to Mary Cassatt's work.  Though phallic, the artist's work didn't seem as readily feminist as the work done by Frida Kahlo.

I don't consider myself a snooty art type, but I truly enjoyed this work.  I think I will continue to see other discussions by this lecturer.",1182297600,2,1453,4.845528455284553
