Was not too happy about brief quips in regard to Turnbull's possible shortcomings; however, they detracted only a little from the harrowing travel events, the meeting and befriending of the Iks, and the wonder-filled glimpse into the lives of people who may be the best examples of human survival in the world.",1409270400,,476,4.734939759036145
8530152,5,B008S1MNQW,"excellent work, sexy too!!! and of course, moving, heart warming what an amazing video. Anthropologically sound. The facts are very clear, good video quality and plenty of interaction with the people. I read the book by collin turnbull, the mountain people first, then watched the movie immediately after and totally enhanced the effect, it was spiritual and I really enjoyed it, it was a real pay off for the 3 weeks I took to read the 300 pages of the book and brought the book to life and well, watch and see. I won't spoil it. great work!!!!",1407974400,,545,4.571428571428571
8530153,2,B008S1MNQW,"In a couple of days they refuted Turnbull's observations?  Now think for a moment, Germany and the third reich in 1940 and Germany in 1970, with nothing written down.  Would the people seem less militaristic and somewhat more tolerant?  Turnbull's observations would only have been valid when he was there in a time of severe famine.  It was an interesting movie, although the relevance of acting out ""A Christmas Carol"" seemed a stretch and waste of time.  I could not help thinking that the conclusion was reached before the movie was started.",1385596800,2,545,4.880434782608695
