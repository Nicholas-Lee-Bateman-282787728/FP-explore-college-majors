8434799,5,B001A47SSC,"I admit; I was quite ignorant of the Pacfic Peoples.  I ordered this video because I watched a show on PBS that had a brief history of the Pacific Islanders.
This is an amazing video!!!!  I already suggested it to my local library and have loaned it out several times.
The Maori War Dance is startling and the histories of the Maori people makes viewing ""Whale Rider"" even more touching.",1322524800,8,387,4.514285714285714
8434800,3,B001A47SSC,"Dances of Life was not only entertaining but it also gave me a new insight into other Polynesian islands I was not aware of.  I learned more about the culture of different Polynesian islands I already knew existed.  They did not show the Tahitian islands culture though.  There was a short video about Tahitian dancing at the end of the film, but no explanation of the Tahitians.  I think there should be more sequels to the Dances of Life DVD, with more dance expert and historians speaking about the culture of each island.  It would be very useful to Polynesian dance instructors on the U.S. mainland, as well as potential tourists who may want to visit the various Polynesian islands.",1245542400,2,688,4.7
