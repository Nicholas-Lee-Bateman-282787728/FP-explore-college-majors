4624685,5,B0059XTUR2,"These days, if you want to film one of Shakespeare's plays and have your finished movie appeal to the masses...or, at least, to more than an art house audience... you can't make the picture appear to be ""Shakespeare"".

Face it.  Shakespeare movies are ""not tonight"" movies (i.e. ""Yes, we should see that one, but not tonight."").

Although it certainly didn't do box-office business to get excited about, actor/director Ralph Fiennes's recent modern day filming of CORIOLANUS, one of The Bard's lesser know works, is as much an exciting action movie as it is a rendition of the play, evoking memories of Ian McKellan's ground-breaking version of RICHARD III.

Director Fiennes, who plays the leading role, makes Shakespeare's narrative easy for audiences to follow by using continuous television news reports that help relate the story of a feared and revered Roman General, suddenly pitted against his own city and fellow citizens.  Rebelling against the political designs of his manipulative mother (Vanessa Redgrave) and banished by his own people, Coriolanus joins forces with his sworn enemy (Gerard Butler) to exact his revenge.

CORIOLANUS is a powerful, well-made, engrossing drama that often makes you forget that you are watching a Shakespearean play.  It is enhanced by performances from a fine cast that includes Jessica Chastain and Brian Cox, who steals every scene in which he appears.

The combination Blu-Ray/DVF pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains audio commentary by Fiennes and a ""Making of"" featurette.

4624686,5,B0059XTUR2,"By now, we are used to seeing Shakespeare's works updated to more modern settings with mixed results. Among the best is Ian McKellen's 1930's fascistic rendering of ""Richard III"" and Kenneth Branagh's exhausting yet fascinatingly Napoleonic ""Hamlet"". Among the worst is PBS's chaotically weird ""Macbeth"" despite Patrick Stewart's brio in the leading role.

Add the new ""Coriolanus"" as perhaps the most fluid adaptation and one so current that it is possible to forget it was written four centuries ago. Directed by and starring Ralph Fiennes, it is a tour de force. And as good as he is, the film is virtually stolen by the great Vanessa Redgrave, whose ferocity in her role makes the screen shake at times.

Coriolanus is one of the Bard's lesser known dramas. General Caius Marcius is a Roman war hero but one who has nothing but contempt for the common people to whom he refuses to pander. The opening scene, which could represent any revolutionary movement from the past one hundred years, shows a crowd marching to storm a granary in search of bread. Times are hard and the people are desperate. Set in the present as it is, we can be in Greece, Syria, Cairo or about to occupy Wall Street. Camera crews and cellphones document the bloody confrontation which ends only when Marcius faces down the mob with the kind of eloquent insults only Shakespeare can muster. ""Go, get you home, you fragments"", Marcius sneers at them. Fiennes face is the perfect vehicle of intensified scorn.

Victorious in battle, betrayed by scheming senators, Marcius, now named Coriolanus for his past conquests, is banished from Rome. I'll go no further. As important as the plot is, what makes the movie work is its immediacy. The themes of political manipulation; the fickle quality of the people (angry yet easily pandered to), the clash of duty and pride; the exploitation of all by the media, are as alive today as when Shakespeare wrote them. There is nothing forced here. The story sits perfectly in the 21st century. Filmed as it is in the former Yugoslavia, the vicious battle scenes portrayed could be news footage from Sarajevo in 1994 or Baghdad ten years later.

Fienne's acting is impeccable. It is hard to loathe or condemn him, no matter one's liberal sensitivities towards the People. He is helped along by Gerard Butler, gripping as Aufidius, the enemy general whom he secretly admires and later joins. But all honors go to Redgrave as Coriolanus's mother, Volumnia, whose domination of her son turns the plot decisively around her fingertips. Standing in front of her rage is like defying a tsunami. Although Octavia Spencer rightfully earned the Best Supporting Actress award this year, Redgrave deserved to share it with her. That she wasn't even nominated is a crime.",1333584000,7,2771,4.927194860813705
4624687,5,B0059XTUR2,"In this rather post-modern adaptation of one of Shakespeare's (allegedly) more infamous plays, Vanessa Redgrave's performance as Volumnia is already being spoken of in the US as a Best Actress contender. Seems she's come to this role loaded with that kind of keen character-conveying insight only a long term astute performer of plays attributed to Shakespeare achieves. If it were up to me to decide, I'd say Redgrave has played in-character so well that she now owns the very concept of Volumnia. Who could possibly own Volumnia, in a future remake, has been put into question.

Ralph Fiennes (prounouced Rafe Fines) has done a marvelous job of directing and acting. It wouldn't surprise me if t/his formiddable adaptation of Coriolanus (2011) received accolades from around the globe.

What I took from this presentation is the first-time ability to really grasp the challenging concepts and ideals that the Renaissance playwright proffers. I feel like I finally know what Coriolanus was intended to convey. As such, after not getting the points from (m)any other adapations, I salute all who make this 2011 version the one with which I can definitively relate.

I'm a big admirer and long time viewer of plays attributed to Shakespeare. Fiennes and Redgrave took on one heck of a project, and, perhaps, it took their partnership in it to finally bring clearly forth the meanings for the public. That's what I call exquisite filmmaking. I also like that Redgrave's Volumnia makes delightful use of her uncanny ability to convey herself androgynously. That was risky to do, had to be done by one most  highly skilled in her artistic craft in order for transcending gender on screen to succeed so well. It's anything but campish.

This has been one heck of a long awaited release, much like Sweeney Todd (with Depp and Bonham Carter) was. I can't wait to get my hands on this DVD at home to watch it ad infiniteum. Like Anonymous (2011), this film needs to be viewed more than several times because the original playwright had complex ideas to convey. Besides, like Anonymous (2011), Coriolanus (2011) is contemporary mastery in too many areas of filmmaking to list. I want to take apart individually each area, such a cinematography, costumes, direction, screen adapation, sound and acting in order to view the film for how each aspect lends to the whole effect. The film is very obviously greater than the sum of its parts. That's also what Anonymous (2011) did for me: inticing me to delve very deeply into the whole content~",1332892800,4,2529,4.9411764705882355
4624688,4,B0059XTUR2,"Shakespere's late military drama ""Coriolanus"" is rarely staged. Perhaps the most famous modern production was at Stratford-upon-Avon: during the run Olivier injured himself in his spectacular death scene and had to be replaced the next performance by a young Albert Finney, leaping into stardom. To my knowledge the new movie version is the first time the tragedy has been filmed, and a very impressive d&eacute;but it is. Ralph Fiennes, who seems to have made a career playing aloof patronising men (Eugene Onegin, et al), is making his own directorial d&eacute;but, guiding himself in a strong performance as the fatally disdainful patrician. He has placed the 5th Century BCE story in our own 21st Century with almost depressing relevance: the military invasion, the political back-stabbings, the bloody assassination are all alarmingly suitable. Most of the violence is presented in the opening sequence, as the Romans storm Carioli and Caius Marcius single-handedly defeats the citadel, earning himself the honorific title Coriolanus. Both Carioli and Rome seem to be suffering inner-city blight as filmed by cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, but, considering the bleakness of this story, his neorealistic vision is apt. The acting  of Fiennes's supporting cast is also realistic, no one attempting a ""grand"" style, yet remaining faithful to Shakespeare's expression. Brian Cox is especially good as Menenius, and his scenes with the two conspirators played by James Nesbitt and Paul Jesson are some of the best in the picture. (By the way, during the crawl credits at the end, we learn that two of the Roman citizens have been christened Cassius and Tamora, dark characters from other tragedies.) Vanessa Redgrave is Volumnia and gives the part a great deal of stern dignity, never allowing her formidable character to become nasty. Volumnia is first and foremost a mother. (Interesting note: Miss Redgrave, who is the daughter of Sir Michael Redgrave, has yet to become Dame Vanessa. She is, of course, a political activist.) Gerard Butler, as Aufidius, is the only cast member who seems to be slightly out of sync, though his hunky presence makes him a believable warrior. The picture is only about two hours long, so needless to say a lot of Bard has been excised; but John Logan's screenplay retains enough of the plot and poetry to make this a worthy Shakespearean production.",1328313600,91,2384,5.224543080939948
4624689,5,B0059XTUR2,"Ralph Fiennes' ""Coriolanus"" is magnificently staged, well-acted, and retains the beauty of Shakespeare's language even while it adeptly moves it into a modern setting and away from its origins as a play.

The formidable task of both directing and acting in a Shakespeare play has attracted previous talents such as Orson Welles (""Macbeth"", ""Othello"") and Kenneth Branagh (""Hamlet"", ""Much Ado About Nothing"") and the results have not always been positive. But Fiennes rises to the task, giving us a powerful and unrepentant Coriolanus even as he gets great performances from his cast and keeps the action moving.

Adapting Shakespeare to modern tastes is even more difficult that directing and acting in the play. The choice to place Ian McKellen's ""Richard III"" (1995) into a 1930s fascist world was not entirely successful, nor was Tim Blake's 2001 ""O"". OTOH, ""West Side Story"" was certainly a crowd pleaser even if it didn't stay true to the language, and Al Pacino's 1996 semi-documentary ""Looking for Richard"" was surprisingly good.

Coriolanus is one of the least popular of Shakespeare's plays and one that is rarely performed. Despite the exquisiteness of the language and the skewering of the mob and politicians alike, the central problem of the play is the lack of a hero to cheer for. Even the dourest of Shakespeare's histories and tragedies have someone to cheer for, but Coriolanus is distinctly lacking anyone worthy of sympathy among the first tier.

Fiennes is not the first person you'd think of to play the warrior general. His Oscar nominated performances in ""The English Patient"" (1996) and ""Schindler's List"" (1993) show none of the character traits Fiennes brings to bear in his powerful performance.

Vanessa Redgrave stars opposite Fiennes as Coriolanus' mother Volumnia, and she gives us yet another of her strong performances, something we've come to expect from the 6 times Oscar nominee and 2 times Emmy winner. For her role here she was nominated for awards in London, New York, and San Francisco film festivals.

Brian Cox puts in a film stealing performance as Fiennes only political ally, Menenius. Cox won an Emmy for ""Nuremberg"" (2000) and a BAFTA for ""The Escapist"" (2008), but he's probably best known for his work in the first two ""Bourne"" films. Quite frankly I've never seen him give a poor performance, and my favorites are ""Braveheart"" (1995) and ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" (1996).

Kudos to Paul Jesson and James Nesbitt as the sleazy politicians who bring about Coriolanus' banishment and to Ashraf Bahom and Lubna Azabal as the leaders of the mob.

In addition to Fiennes' direction, the photography by Barry Ackroyd is stunning. The hand held close ups that frame many of the scenes may distract some viewers, but it's part of the formula that moves this play into a full scale movie. Ackroyd is the Oscar nominated cinematographer from ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008) and he handles the war scenes in this film with comparable aplomb.

Ray Beckett handles the sound and in a film like this, the sound is critical. Beckett won an Oscar for his work on ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008) and he is even more impressive here.

The only disappointment is Gerald Butler, as Aufidius, the leader of Rome's chief foe. Butler can be compelling in films like ""300"" (2006) and ""Reign of Fire"" (2002), but his thick Scottish accent is not suited to Shakespeare, and in his more heated speeches he is nearly unintelligible.

The NY Times called Fiennes ""thrilling"" and he earned a BAFTA nomination for his directing efforts. The Hollywood Reporter said ""Ralph Fiennes makes Shakespeare modern and bloody brilliant"" and Peter Travers in The Rolling Stone said ""the power of the piece is undeniable.""

Bottom line - an excellent film.

(Caution - if you're not familiar with the play, or the history, you might want to do some homework before jumping in)",1327795200,63,3869,4.998444790046657
4624690,4,B0059XTUR2,"First-time director Ralph Fiennes has certainly set himself a challenge.

Not only has taken on Shakespeare, never a straightforward prospect for conversion to celluloid, but one of the less well-known tragedies at that, and one notably short of famous scenes and quotable quotes. He's also modernised the staging to boot and, to top it all off, has directed himself in the leading role. This last feat is you'd have to imagine to be a logistical challenge at least (and .... action! [cue director dashing into the frame]) and one where that key creative tension, between conductor and principal soloist, is eschewed. In a Shakespearian tragedy, of course, you can almost imagine it being achieved by soliloquy.

It might as well be: soliloquies, a staple of the bard's ""glamour"" tragedies, are otherwise in short supply here. Caius Martius' tragic flaw is precisely that he doesn't much go in for them: Martius is a warrior, given to the unsentimental prosecution of convictions. This is a character trait with little use for interior monologue.

Martius' principles - pride, as rendered in the Shakespearian discourse - sees him unwilling to compromise by lionising either himself or his public, even for the sake of good order. He is, therefore, acutely vulnerable to snakish political schemers of the senate like the unctuous Sicinius (James Nesbit, cast entirely with type) who will make such compromises, and who rightly perceive Martius' unflexing virtue as a threat to their hegemony.

As I've not seen or read Coriolanus before I may be displaying my unschooled ineptitude when I say there are surprising parallels with the story of Christ - a character of similarly unswerving principle, albeit given to peace and love in place of Coriolanus' mortal combat. Like Christ, Coriolanus is embraced and then rejected by a fickle public, whipped up by mendacious politicians. Like Christ he spends forty days in the wilderness finding his resolve. Like Christ he is finally sacrificed in the name of his principle. In other respects he is a dark inversion, of course, which is why this is a tragedy and the new Testament is not. Coriolanus dies for no-one's sins but his own.

Fiennes' presentation is impressive indeed, particularly for a debutant. The modern day staging, complete with steadycam footage, switches between a complacent and vaguely Berlusconian Roman senate, and the war-torn streets of Antium which are more like Belgrade (not so surprising, as that's where the movie was filmed!), and is always strikingly captured: the scenes of military combat are as brutal and well-staged as Generation Kill. The scarcely (but definitely) adapted16th century language  jars at first,  but in the mouths of the leads, those dissonances quickly subside. The supporting cast is less convincing with it.

Indeed, the main acting is superb. Fiennes is ragingly, boilingly intense: not for an instant do you doubt his emotion, and I fancy he would have been a grumpy so-and-so on the set to boot: you can't switch that sort of intensity on and off. So too is the elegant, nowadays elderly, Vanessa Redgrave as Martius' mother Volumnia (which sounds like a joke name of Monty Python's devising), and scottish dreamboat Gerard Butler plays Martius' less-flawed nemesis Aufidius with power and poise, not a million miles from his portayal of Leonidas in 300.

If I have reservations they are with the screenplay, which surely has had to make some concessions for staging and length, and struggles to adequately convey the development of a typically convoluted Shakespearian plot. It is not helped by the play's lack of familiar Shakespearian staging posts: there is no ""a kingdom for my horse"" moment, and as a result there are lengthy patches where plot exposition, delivered by supporting actors in marble-mouthed pentameter, gets mangled. It is useful to have boned up on the synopsis beforehand. By contrast, with due credit to Fiennes, there are some purely visual segments (particularly during Martius' march to exile) which are strikingly effective and benefit from being free from Shakespeare's idiom.

The film, over all, is never less than watchable, and is punctuated by electric exchanges between Fiennes, Redgrave, Butler and the ever-brilliant Brian Cox, so this imperfect film comes nonetheless well recommended.

4624691,4,B0059XTUR2,"This is a tight, well-crafted script by John Logan. Cutting Shakespeare can be difficult and he did an excellent job, along with Ralph Fiennes of getting us the information we need to follow the story while still keeping us interested.

Fiennes is very, very good in this. His intensity blazes throughout, as a soldier's soldier and a man with little to connect him to the people outside of his comfort zone--aka the battlefield.

Vanessa Redgrave is, as always, compelling as Volumnia. She will definitely be up for some awards for this performance.

Just to comment on the first post made--

This movie is nothing at all like Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet. Luhrmann's film was Shakespeare on acid [i very much liked that film as well]. This is something completely different. Simply labeling it 'a grown up R&J' does a disservice to Coriolanus. Just because it's modernized doesn't make it similar, at all.

It is Shakespeare, so for the first few minutes while you're getting used to the language it will throw you off. But the actors are so skilled in this film they make sense of the text for you, so you can understand and enjoy the use of Shakespeare's language. There are some wonderful soliloquies in the movie as well. If you don't like Shakespeare or you don't want to pay attention, don't see it, simple as that.",1324425600,163,1322,4.755458515283843

4625442,1,B0059XTUR2,"I actually liked most of Shakespeare's plays, but this was not one of them.  Evidently this was not one of his better works, as I had never heard of this one.  In fact, I was not expecting a Shakespearean play when I chose to watch this, and I probably would not have watched it had I known in advance.  I don't read ""the critics"" before watching a movie - I like to make up my own mind.

Not all old plays update well to modern settings, and this is one that does not.  (If you're going to talk about swords at least someone on the set should have one, not machine guns!)  This is not a ""full"" update but only a ""partial"" update as the most important part - the dialogue - was not updated, only the costumes and props.  Guns, cars, televisions, and cell phones were not around in Shakespeare's time and do not belong in a Shakespearean play.  Similarly, the language used may have been appropriate in Shakespeare's time (I doubt it) but certainly is not in the 21st century.  As a result of this partial modernization, this work is no longer a tragic play, nor is it an action drama, but is instead a poorly written science fiction mashup.

I did get a good laugh during one scene where Coriolanus (Fiennes) is addressing his ""troops"" and after a modest-length diatribe his men are crouching around, and all of them have looks on their faces that say ""What in the hell is he talking about?""

it's not really a modern update ... if anything, it feels like a dystopian version of the 80s or 90s ... I don't recall anyone using the Internet or cellphones, for example, but there are 90s-style CNN news programs and modern military equipment.

the dialogue is old-school Shakespeare, not updated at all ... the main-characters (mostly British) are first-rate, handle it very well.  secondary characters and background characters (many non-speaking) are non-British and don't come across as well.  the words just don't flow organically, which is not surprising.

set in Italy, but filmed in Serbia, probably on a limited budget ... it shows in the background scenery, and the background extras.  but it mostly works, since it looks convincingly devastated.

4626010,5,B0059XTUR2,"Coriolanus is one of Shakespeare's last plays and frankly one of the more complex. It was based upon one of the Plutarch tales and as such is consistent with the many uses Shakespeare made of classic events. As Plutarch observed:

""It may be observed, in general, that when young men arrive early at fame and repute, if they are of a nature but slightly touched with emulation, this early attainment is apt to extinguish their thirst and satiate their appetite; whereas the first distinctions of more and solid and weighty characters do but stimulate and quicken them and take them away like a wind in the pursuit of honour; they look upon these marks and testimonies to their virtue not as a recompense received for what they have already done, but as a pledge given by themselves of what they will perform hereafter, ashamed now to forsake or underlive the credit they have won, or, rather, not to exceed and obscure all that is gone before by the lustre of their following actions. Marcius, having a spirit of this noble make, was ambitious always to surpass himself, and did nothing how extraordinary soever, but he thought he was bound to outdo it at the next occasion; and ever desiring to give continual fresh instances of prowess, he added one exploit to another, and heaped up trophies upon trophies, so as to make it matter of contest also among his commanders, the latter still vying with the earlier, which should pay him the greatest honour and speak highest in his commendation. Of all the numerous wars and conflicts in those days there was not one from which he returned without laurels and rewards.  But Marcius, believing himself bound to pay his mother Volumnia all that gratitude and duty which would have belonged to his father, had he also been alive, could never satiate himself in his tenderness and respect to her.""

From this did Shakespeare develop his character. The version Coriolanus by Ralph Fiennes presents the main character, Coriolanus, in a contemporary setting and presents him as an awkward savior of Rome which then through a manipulation of the masses turn on him which leads to his destruction. Coriolanus is a warrior, not a politician. The politicians manipulate the mob, yet within the mob there are other layers of manipulators. There are what have been called from time to time the ""professional back stabbers"". This is a group of what may be genetically oriented persons whose sole goal in life is to destroy others. Nothing personal, nothing for a desired end, just the process of personal destruction. Washington is a current day example of where they most congregate. Thus this class attacks Coriolanus who appears both clueless and disinterested. Fiennes does a splendid job at depicting this. The Corialanus of Fiennes is a military hero, thrust upon the political stage yet with a total dislike for politics and moreover the mob, albeit having been the savior of this very mob. The characterization of Coriolanus has changed from age to age, from the evil militarist to the errant soldier. Fiennes presents an interesting character development, with depth and by the end an appreciation for the man, even sympathy.

The mob is a key element of Coriolanus. Yes, the mob can be manipulated. Yes, the results are tragic for all. But that is not why Shakespeare wrote this play. At the time the play was presented, James I was King. There was not major concern for the ""mob"" One may guess that the last time the ""mob"" revolted was the peasants revolution of 1381. Thus one does wonder from whence the dislike of the manipulated mob came.

Shakespeare seems not to like the populous. As noted by some authors his use of the term popular, as understood to me in relation to the masses seemed always to end in some disaster. The masses can and could be manipulated. The manipulators often do so just for the process itself without any end in mind. The tragedy here is that Coriolanus was a good soldier who was thrown out of his ken, and at first accepted and then destroyed by the masses, to no benefit to them.

But what most seem to miss about Coriolanus as a play and political metaphor is in the play the Tribunes manipulate the masses. In the current election cycle on the Republican side, this seems not to be the case. In fact the masses are rejecting the Tribunes. It is thus an interesting and telling drama. Can the masses be manipulated? All the time. We see it in every strategy. As one of the Democrat Tribunes states; never let a tragedy do to waste. As immoral as such a statement may be, it is echoed so many times.

Thus I would rate the Fiennes presentation as a five star one! To do Shakespeare well, one must understand the underlying human tragedy, not try to make it some anti-politician statement. Done that way it becomes just an echo from the very mob itself, it is popular to paraphrase Shakespeare.",1469232000,3,4872,4.731448763250883

A soldier who sacrifice everything and realizes his good fortune just being alive.  Soon he sees the folly of his ""la vie du guerrier"", as it is plaid out under the puppet masters, that include the duplicitous house speaker, two populists senators, and his manipulative mother, each talking their turn at the strings for their aims not his, nor his country.  All the while he seems to snatch the ropes of his fate and brings his enemy to a intimate closeness, only to find, the strings are now held, well... watch the movie.

The film was slightly melodramatic, and it's aim was to view as a Shakespearean play and it somewhat succeeded.  One criticism I have is that Gerard Butler cannot seem to drop his Scottish accent.  He does so somewhat for his English parts, but could not shake it here.

Spoiler:  It seemed unnatural that Aufinnius should welcome Martius so quickly when he is exiled from Rome for his words with the plebians.  They had fought about 20 times or more intending to inflict mortal harm.  I think that the closing scene was was a better ending than the peace treaty afore signed.

4626849,5,B0059XTUR2,"Ralph Fiennes directed and played the title role in this excellent, tight version of this late Shakespearean tragedy.  The initial situation is that there is a food shortage in Rome at a time when the city is under attack by the Volscians and their charismatic leader Aufidius (Gerard Butler).  The Roman populace, led by their tribunes and some activists, deeply suspect that the ruling aristocrats could, if they wanted, release more stored grain to make bread for the starving people, and in the first half of the movie, as in the play, they focus their anger on the arrogant aristocrat Coriolanus -- who also happens to be a bona fide military hero and defender of the city against the Volscians.  When Coriolanus runs for public office on the strength of his military service, the tribunes manage to play on his temperamental flaws and bring about his exile.  The action is updated from the time of the Roman Republic to what looks like the modern Balkans, and although there's initially a sense of slight awkwardness of fit -- for the city is still called ""Rome"" and the political arrangements therein seem distinctly un-Balkan -- it works very well, and in fact as the movie goes on, the way in which Coriolanus's exile and alliance with the Volscians is handled seems very effective.  In the course of a winter journey from ""Rome"" to Aufidius's camp Fiennes acquires a beard that makes him resemble Bradley Cooper in ""American Sniper,"" and the way in which his military prowess and charisma wins over the Volscians and awakens Aufidius's jealousy is very persuasive and sets up the ending beautifully.  I have to say that it works too to see scenes of military action -- which we don't see in staged versions -- that demonstrate Coriolanus's prowess and courage.  In the movie's early scenes, the urban warfare in Corioli, where the protagonist, heretofore simply Caius Martius, wins his name after defeating the Volscians there, are as persuasive as any gritty representation of such action as you'll see on the screen, and it also establishes the extent to which Coriolanus is most himself when he's in battle, and so it makes sense later when he seems to become a kind of efficient killing machine.  The other dimension that the movie's updating highlights, by virtue of its attention to modern media, is the way reputations are made and come to matter and are subject to manipulation.

Fiennes gives a great performance as a man who disdains the very people that he is serving and protecting. He is an aristocrat who has no time for the idea of popular sovereignty, and we come to understand, thanks also to a great performance by Vanessa Redgrave as Volumnia, his mother, that both ideals -- military prowess and arrogant disdain of the populace, his sense of himself as a remarkable person -- have been bred into him since the cradle.  So there comes to be a psychological dynamic at work, as well as a political one, an odd blend of oddly-directed eroticism and unreflecting ideology.  Apart from his mother, the only person Coriolanus admires is the soldier most like him -- the Volscian Aufidius, who is also an enemy of Rome.  So when the tribunes, the leaders of the Roman populace, manipulate a situation that leads to Coriolanus's exile, by making his disdain for the people into an accusation of treason, it makes sense that he would find his way to Aufidius and offer him help in the Volscian's war against Rome.  If Rome considers him an enemy, then he'll be an implacable enemy, and with the Volscian army, he marches on Rome.  The Romans now regret the exile of Coriolanus, for they have no military leader of comparable courage or competence, and in the climax of the action -- marvellously staged and paced in this movie -- first Coriolanus's friend Menenius (Brian Cox) and then his family (Volumnia, and his wife [Jessica Chastain] and child) plead to him for peace.  Coriolanus resists Menenius, but after an extended scene gives way to his mother, and it's clear in that scene that both Volumnia and Coriolanus understand that for him to agree to peace is to in effect betray the Volscians and Aufidius.  What follows is predictable and painful.  The work that Fiennes and Redgrave do in that great confrontation between mother and son is as good Shakespearean acting as I've seen on stage or screen, and in fact this movie works every bit as well as earlier ""great"" Shakespearean movies like Olivier's ""Hamlet"" and Branagh's ""Henry V.""

The cast is rock-solid throughout.  Coriolanus's wife is a thankless small part, but Jessica Chastain makes it count.  Brian Cox is a gloomy realist as Menenius, always working to balance the interests of his friend with those of the people and those of Rome as a whole.  Gerard Butler is fine as Aufidius, and it was a nice touch in the movie to show him as warmly embraced by his people in a way that Coriolanus was not by his.  The Scottish accents of Butler and the actors playing his officers neatly establishes the ""alien-ness'' of the Volscian's viv-a-vis Rome.  But this is at heart Fiennes's and Redgrave's show, and it's very potent stuff.  Highly recommended.",1449619200,2,5140,4.814772727272727

4626942,4,B0059XTUR2,"I really did not know which star to press. I chose #4 because of my highest regard for Ralph Fiennes, one of our greatest actors and a committed Shakespearean. However, although I saw this film in theater when it came out, bought the blu-ray and watched it twice, I have profound misgivings about this film version of a major Shakespeare tragedy. Here goes. Of all of Shakespeare's tragedies, this is the one most rooted in its historical time and place. When Fiennes, scriptwriter and director, yanked it out the ground, he just severed the roots and a lot of the text, and poorly transplanted it in the Balkan wars of the 1980s. It just doesn't fit.
 His performance is fiercely committed, Vanessa Redgrave is incandescent. However, what we see is not a tragedy as Shakespeare conceived it. Before you can have a tragic hero, you need a - hero. And this version is resolutely non-heroic'. How can a modern battle field with guns that can rip a body apart replace the face-to-face combat with swords? How can bravery be anything except foolishness with such weapons killing men left and right? And in those opening scenes, Shakespeare does present Coriolanus as an almost Homeric warrior. That's what makes his Fall so disturbing. In the play, after his murder, Aufidius honors him in the funeral arrangements and says, MY RAGE IS GONE,/AND I AM STRUCK WITH SORROW. In this film, his enemies dump Coriolanus's corpse in the back of a jeep. Could Shakespeare's characterization be more thoroughly debased and maligned? Coriolanus may be his least appealing tragic hero, but to strip him of his tragic destiny makes no sense, because there is just a big void at the end. Instead of tragedy we get what? Proof that tragedy is no long a viable point of view? It's just like all those poor soldiers getting killed without a chance of glory in the opening battle scene.

According to one source, Shakespeare's play contains 3,417 lines.  Fiennes cut at least 90% of them.  Reductio ad absurdum.  The setting is post-apocolyptic quasi-Rome, but is it really the Balkans?  The ""Roman"" Legion Vs. Serbs (or Chechnians) wear camoflage & jackboots in their shoot-um-ups with Uzees (sp.) & WMDs.  The Senate wear business suits & plot a coup.

I guess the point of the play is that a winning politician kisses babies & butts of the rabble (the great unwashed).  Julius Caesar was a master of crowd-pleasing, but it was beneath proud Coriolanus to so humble himself.  The silly ass brings about his own downfall & nobody cares.

He's a Momma's boy, brought to his knees before Matriarch Vanessa Redgrave, brilliantly played, whose over-weaning ambition borders on the pathological.  His homo-erotic embraces with his sworn enemy (in every fight) nullify those with his adoring wife, Jessica Chastain (wasted in the film).

4626984,4,B0059XTUR2,"This is a very cool Shakespeare adaptation - certainly, it's better than the somewhat mediocre ratings here and on IMDB would suggest.

I wasn't too familiar with the original play before I watched this, but it deals with a lot of standard Shakespearean topics: war, politics, male-female relations, mob mentality, etc. It shares some themes with fellow Roman play Julius Caesar, but is certainly different enough to be interesting in its own right. Maybe it's not quite in Hamlet's class, but second-class Shakespeare is still better than most of what gets written today.

As for Ralph Fiennes' production...hey, I liked it. I'm so used to modernized versions of Shakespeare that nothing about the present-day setting really bothered me. I agree, it's odd to bring guns into a play that so obviously involved personal combat with swords, but I didn't mind that much. Overall, I think using a contemporary setting was a good way to demonstrate that the politics and social commentary in the original play are still very relevant.

The cast, meanwhile, is superb. Vanessa Redgrave is awesome as Volumnia - clearly one of Shakespeare's best female characters, I think - and Brian Cox gives solid support as the politician Menenius. Ralph Fiennes brings his usual scary charisma to the title role, and Gerard Butler is well-cast as his mortal enemy. All of the actors give intense performances, and do a good job of making Shakespeare's language understandable to a modern audience.

I have a few minor complaints, though. The early parts of the movie are fast-paced, violent and exciting, but in the second half I noticed that the pace sagged, and it became more obvious that this is a film-based-on-a-play. I would've been curious to see Fiennes (who directed as well as starred) try to maintain a fast cinematic pace throughout, even if that meant tinkering with the original text some more. Also, Jessica Chastain has a slightly thankless role as Coriolanus' wife Virgilia, who never comes to life in the same way as Volumnia. These are pretty minor complaints, though; the film as a whole is very compelling.

Re: the DVD itself, it's not a bad little package. It comes with a short making-of special, and a low-key but thoughtful director's commentary by Fiennes. If you're a Shakespeare groupie, I heartily recommend picking it up.",1405728000,,2335,5.023255813953488

4627012,4,B0059XTUR2,"Politicians and/or military generals get in trouble for all sorts of reasons -- corruption, sex scandals, treachery, being a crack addict, etc.

But you don't often hear about them getting in trouble for being brutally honest about what they think... partly because it never happens. Yet this is what happens in ""Coriolanus,"" a gritty grey adaptation of Shakespeare's classic tragedy of a great but deeply flawed military man, with an all-around amazing all-star cast including Ralph Fiennes, Gerard Butler and Vanessa Redgrave.

While the original play was set in ancient Rome, this takes place on a modern Rome-that-might-have-been -- a Roman Republic with guns and bombs and cars. And no, it's not set in another country that is just referred to as Rome. One scene has Coriolanus lecturing his troops... who are standing in front of a wall covered in graffiti IN LATIN. This is meant to be a modern version of Rome.

Roman general Caius Martius (Fiennes) is leading a war against the Volscians, led by his counterpart Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler). After Martius wins a decisive victory against Aufidius, and gains the city of Corioles for Rome, he's welcomed back as a hero and given the official name of ""Coriolanus."" His glory-hungry mother (Redgrave) encourages him to strike while the iron is hot, and run for consul.

Here's the problem: Coriolanus has a lot of contempt for the common people, and when his political enemies Brutus (Paul Jesson) and Sicinius (a scarily gimlet-eyed James Nesbitt) arrange for the crowds to be filled with... well, the sort of gullible idiots you're confronted with at every election. You know, the people who are shocked when politicians turn out to be liars, and whose convictions are so deep that one heckler can change their minds.

So when the crowds are swayed against him, Coriolanus ends up having a massive public outburst that not only kills his political career, but gets him exiled. He ends up going to the Volscians to serve under his beloved enemy Aufidius (the foe yay between these two is blinding, and very textually-supported), turning the tide of the war against Rome. Is there any way to bring his old loyalties back?

""Coriolanus"" is Ralph Fiennes' directorial debut and... well, let's just say he's not as good a director as he is an actor. It's not a bad movie, and he does a pretty interesting job updating Rome into a 20th/21st-century republic rather than an ancient one. But it feels too flat and ""samey"" at times, with no real rises or falls in the way is told -- no moments that are uplifting, heartrending or stirring.

No, this is a movie whose quality rests almost entirely on the shoulders of the actors. So it's a good thing that Fiennes has an all-star cast of very, very talented people here, including himself in the titular role. His Coriolanus is a fiery man whose outer armor is so thickened that only rage and bitterness can seep through, partly because of the way his mother has always encouraged him to fight and die for Rome.

That mother is played to perfection to rigid, gleaming-eyed perfection by Redgrave, who can't quite understand why her daughter-in-law might like to have an actual husband instead of an uber-general to reflect glory on them all. Jessica Chastain mostly gets to look sad and hint her dissatisfaction in this movie, but she has some stirring lines at the climax. And Gerard Butler gives a riveting performance as the Volscian commander who both adores and hates Coriolanus, purring his burred lines like a bearded jungle cat.

But despite the somewhat flat direction, the setting works to emphasize the joyless, cold life that Coriolanus lives -- stone and concrete, flat grey uniforms, and gathering places rimmed with wire fences and armed troops. The only other places we see are ruins filled with bombs, blood and guns, and the only passion we see in Coriolanus is when he and Aufidius have a knife fight. He is a tool of death and war, nothing more -- and everything around him reflects that.

While Ralph Fiennes' direction is rather flat, ""Coriolanus"" is mostly buoyed up by its bleak modern-style setting and a brilliant cast of actors. See it for the performances alone.",1402272000,3,4191,4.881856540084388
4627013,1,B0059XTUR2,"The random death and nihilistic murder that begins with the very first scenes of this film and carries on throughout the film is at odds with the dramatic arc of Shakespeare's play, which is, of course, very violent, but takes place in an era where face-to-face combat made killing personal and supported a code of ""honor"" -- which animates the characters' actions and gives them meaning. ""Coriolanus"" makes no sense in a modern war of automatic weapons,  explosions, and impersonal killing. Any impact that Shakespeare's words might have had in this film is overwhelmed by the impact of the vividly depicted and deliberately shocking acts of violence onscreen. This movie is not about viewing or understanding contemporary violence or violent men through the lens of Shakepeare's play, its simply one more violent spectacle, full of sound and fury, etc.",1400716800,6,854,5.143884892086331

There is much food for thought and many questions open for discussion. The film is tight, well cast, excellently directed, and the production values are high. I think the pivotal act of having to bare oneself in front of the people and show your scars does not translate well to a modern setting. The idea of the people, as a mob, unseating a tribunal after he has been appointed by the government would be easier to swallow in the context of ancient Rome.

4627039,3,B0059XTUR2,"Coriolanus, a movie directed by Ralph Fiennes, is set in a modern-day version of pre-imperial Rome. This modern adaptation is another attempt at modernization of Shakespeares plays.
None of Shakespeares plays was set up in Elizabethan London. There was a good reason for that. The inner content of the plays illustrates the operation of higher states of the human mind. Some of these states are only partially operational; some are on the verge of becoming active; and some are still latent. This corresponds to certain experiences that are somehow familiar but still not quite comprehensible; or possible but not encountered yet; or seemingly impossible. Such situations may be illustrated as a series of events taking place in somewhat familiar environment; or in remote locations at other times; or in some imaginary places and times. By creating such settings it is possible to illustrate the nature of these higher states, the conditions required for their activation, and the sequence of their manifestation. Therefore, changing the original setting of the plays dilutes the intended impact on the audience.
There is also another factor. All Shakespeares plays form one narrative. The plays are arranged in a specific sequence that parallels the activation of the higher states. For example Coriolanus serves as a reference play. It defines the initial state of Rome prior to experiences that are described in the remaining plays of the Roman tetralogy. Changing the setting, therefore, corrupts the sequence.
But this does not mean that it is not possible to make a good and interesting movie by changing the original settings. However, such changes greatly reduce the overall impact. And it is this impact that is the most valuable and unique feature of Shakespeares plays.",1384041600,,1781,5.252631578947368

That being said I must admit I almost stopped this film a few minutes into it b/c it wasn't what I thought it was and there are parts I would call dull and slow. However I gave it a chance to play out more and am so glad I did, the classic story here being shown in a modern way is absolutely fantastic. I would recommend this film, especially if you're willing to be patient with it initially. A strong passionate performance by Mr. Fiennes

The text is pure Shakespeare & what I mean by that is there is not any dialogue which is not in the original written text. The narrative is formal in the order of the play. The dialogue is less than half of the actual text but if the complete text were used the actors would be speaking extremely fast as early film versions of Shakespeare's works show i.e ""As You Like It"" with Sir Lawrence Olivier. Hollywood has a huge task at hand just to share the works of Shakespeare with American audiences and the world. Sam Worthington in Macbeth, Titus with Jessica Lang & Anthony Hopkins, The Merchant of Venice with Al Pacino and As You Like It with Alfred Molina are good examples of how the works of Shakespeare can be enjoyed without missing the narrative or misunderstanding the dialogue.

4627102,3,B0059XTUR2,"In theory I support any effort to make Shakespeare relevant: sometimes this involves moving the play forward; sometimes backward. This version attempts to move the play forward...

Unfortunately here I don't think it really works. The actors are all good, I'm okay with the script and editing (it's a necessary evil for modern audiences), but it doesn't quite fit. There were exceptions: I thought moving some of the marketplace scenes to television studios worked really well; I suspect this was at least in part the idea that inspired this adaptation.

But some of the other scenes are going to be nonsensical to a modern audience; the scene of Coriolanus hitchhiking I thought was hilarious. When was the last time you heard of a fallen dictator hitchhiking his way out of town? ;) But the best example is the custom of a Roman consul candidate appearing in public to show his scars and beg the popular support of the people; this scene is critical to the original play, but I don't think it works here as Fiennes appearing in a suit surrounding by bodyguards. We just don't have a custom like that, and I think people unfamiliar with the original play aren't going to get what is supposed to be going on here.

My last criticism would be, I said all the actors were good, but Fiennes seems to totally miss the character. I suppose he was trying to update it, but in playing Coriolanus as a one-dimensional hate monger you miss the whole tragedy of the play. Where is the tragedy in this movie? Does anyone sympathize with Coriolanus as he dies? Or are we supposed to feel like he finally got what's coming to him? In the original play, the tragedy comes from the fact that Coriolanus was raised by mother to be honest and noble, Rome praised him for it, then when it wasn't expedient to them they all cast him off. Was it his flaws, given him by those in power, that we are to blame? Or do we blame him, for not being able to change (when he needed to)?

But where is this in this version? What we get from Fiennes is a one-dimensional tyrant who seems to care for no one, only full of bile and hate, until he finally cries when he mother screams at him at the end. Was that supposed to flip our opinion of him? What a modern adaptation of this play really needs is some way to redeem Coriolanus to modern eyes, as he would not have appeared to an Elizabethan audience as the despicable tyrant that he appears to be here.

So I like the actors, I thought they did passing well with the text, I love to see Shakespeare attempted in new ways, but unfortunately, for me, this one doesn't really work. Unfortunately, I say, because that leaves us with only the old BBC version to watch... but if you want to see Shakespeare done well you can watch any production done by the Globe (Henry IV is very good, or As You Like It), or if you prefer something updated I recommend 10 Things I Hate About You or Shakespeare in Love.",1372550400,9,2922,4.4440298507462686
4627103,4,B0059XTUR2,"The plot of Coriolanus, as with many of Shakespeare's tragedies, is utterly predictable. So, for the most part, are the characters' motivations. But the words, the speeches, the exchanges, the asides--they are glorious and moving. Fiennes is at his best here, as is Vanessa Redgrave as his mother.

Setting this play in modern times, with tanks, M-16s, AK-47s, and the rest, is brilliant. It brings the conflict to life in a way that is compelling... and appalling. The war scenes are almost too realistic, as harrowing as the opening scene in ""Saving Private Ryan."" The use of television, cars, the steps of modern public buildings, all are masterful. This is great moviemaking.

My biggest problem with the movie is the sound. It goes from roaring, room-shaking explosions, shouts, and chaos to the most intimate whispers and mumbled asides.

This is a Shakespeare play, if you do not like the language of Shakespeare please skip this movie.
If you do not like to hear edited Shakespeare skip this movie.
This play is set in modern times and dress. If you do not like Shakespeare in modern times and costumes...
There will also be some violence of the modern sudden and bloody kind this may also be a reason for you to skip.
Now that we are past the filters

General Caius Martius (played by Ralph Fiennes who also directs) will earn the title/name Coriolanus by violently leading from the front and thereby breaking the siege of and taking the city Corioli. He would be honored by Rome and promoted, although later banished from Rome. This much is history. At least it was believed to be history when Shakespeare wrote Coriolanus. There is no some doubt about the history of Caius Martius, then again there are doubts about Shakespeare. So much for history.
As presented in the film version, General Caius Martius is a great warrior. He is a darling of the Senate and a true war hero. He has fought battles for Rome since he was sixteen and now bears 27 honorable wounds. He believes he has earned the right to the Consulship of Rome having earned the vote (voice) of the people by his wounds. Unfortunately he has no love of the people. He regards them as living corpses befouling HIS air. The People, he says to the mob, are at once afraid of war and incapable of coping with peace and too inconsistent in their favors.
Coriolanus is a play about an anti-Julius Caesar.
Caesar was a man who sought high office, but had the ability to connect with the common people. He was a threat to and held in suspicion by the Senate. It would be the `Conscript Fathers', aka the Boni who would betray him.

In other words both Gaius Julius Caesar and Caius Martius Coriolanus were highly effective military leaders, both determined to be the first men of Rome. For the former, his power base was in the mob and in the other the Senate. Between the plays Julius Caesar and Coriolanus have mirrored versions of a similar plot.

In this version of Coriolanus the use of modern dress makes for a more visceral feel to the violence and a better sense how these old plays continue to reflect modern problems. Successful military leaders are often award high political office. Their fitness for political power is not certain. The jealousy of those who may be better able to, or think they are better able to wield power remain real issues all over the globe.

Most reviews will point to the characters playing the Tribunes of the Plebs as corrupt and two faced. They are certainly portrayed as smarmy, underhanded and self-interested. However, the job of the Tribunes was to insure that the voice of the people was not over ridden by the Senate. Tribunes were representatives of the public. In Coriolanus, they had reason to know he could not be trusted to protect the people. The General had made clear he would suspend civil rights and that he held the public in open contempt. The Tribunes make repeated efforts to give the general the chance to pretend to love the people and he repeatedly condemns himself from his own mouth.

As for Coriolanus the loyal soldier, he fails this test, twice. His inability to understand the term loyalty and the demands of political power are the root issues of this movie. The audience is left to ponder just how heroic is the fierce warrior once the issue is more complex than war fighting.

For me Coriolanus is a two person movie. Ralph Fiennes is intense. Often he is a tangible and fearsome presence on the screen. His mother played by Vannessa Redgrave will own the stage by strength of her gravitas and oratory. Her character, Volumnia is the only one who fully comprehends the stakes at playing national level politics and she is the only one who can reach or teach her son. Between these two is the dramatic center of the movie.
Other characters skulk about, conversing and commenting. Generally the cast members succeed in portraying complex people not just background props. Jessica Chastain is left with little to do but make concerned mother faces and follow the lead of whoever else is in the room. This is a capable actress doing little more than wearing costumes.

I liked Coriolanus,. Because of the edits, the movie moves faster that Shakespeare generally manages. The scene of the television talking heads nattering in the language of the Bard was the more effective for the language. If this is your first exposure to Shakespeare, your expectations may be fatally misdirected by the action and the speed of the plot progress.  Coriolanus is a serious movie, for a serious viewer. If you are clear on what this movie is, this will be a rewarding movie.",1370131200,2,4948,4.65979381443299

4627134,4,B0059XTUR2,"Shot in war-torn Serbia, Ralph Fiennes' version of CORIOLANUS vividly illustrates the play's political themes. The eponymous hero (Fiennes himself) is a brave, outwardly successful general enjoying both political and military success - that is, until he is elected to the role of consul in the city of Rome.  Then his penchant for speaking the truth becomes a liability rather than an asset: Tribunes Brutus and Sicinius (James Nesbitt, Paul Jesson) contrive to have him banished from the city. Coriolanus' response is swift and bloody, as he switches sides to form an alliance with his deadliest enemy Aufidius (Gerard Butler) to attack Rome in revenge.  The film illustrates the perils of political life, as Coriolanus is unable to cope with the scheming and hypocrisy necessary to sustain his success.  He relies too much on Menenius (Brian Cox) who, although a consummate manipulator, cannot guarantee Coriolanus' future.  However Coriolanus is not quite the heroic character he believes himself to be; he is quite willing to turn on his allies if it suits his particular purpose.  Hence we feel that he somehow deserves what happens to him in the end.  The film's stand-out performance, however, comes from Vanessa Redgrave as Coriolanus' mother Volumnia - a strong-minded personality who stands up for her principles.  Would that her son had followed her example.  British news anchor Jon Snow turns up in a cameo role, announcing the bad tidings.",1366761600,,1453,5.17948717948718

SHAKESPEARE, whose stupid old 'English' makes no sense at all (though it is sometimes translated into real American talk in high schools), wrote in the past, so he has nothing important or interesting to say to us now. He didn't even know about cellphones, but they are used in this movie, which thinks it can make him modern or 'relevant.'  Forget it!  He wrote about crazy generals and stupid people manipulated by slimy politicians--so what??  That has nothing to do with America today.  Shakespeare is history!

WATCH OUT FOR THE PHONY TRAILER!  It tries to make this look like a cool action movie, but--as the sharp reviewers who rated this with only 1 or 2 starts found out, but only after getting ripped off--this movie is nothing but a lot of talk!  And you can't even understand what anybody says!

DON'T BE FOOLED by the reviewers who say this is a magnificent play (some dope called T.S.

4627148,3,B0059XTUR2,"Excerpt:

 Ralph Fiennes' Coriolanus is a lively and intense adaptation of an obscure Shakespeare play--especially obscure, considering this is the first-ever attempt to deliver it to the big screen.

There's probably a reason for the neglect--Caius Martius (dubbed 'Coriolanus' after his conquest of the Volscian city of Corioles)--is an unregenerate bastard, a highborn military career officer seeking election to high office who looks down upon ordinary men, claiming their breaths reek o'th'rotten fens, whose loves I prize / As the dead carcasses of unburied men / That do corrupt my air. Asked to display his battle scars to the public--a Roman tradition when campaigning--he puts down the wounds as mere Scratches with briers / Scars to move laughter only, and declares I would not buy / Their mercy at the price of one fair word.

Coriolanus in effect is an unbending man, who refuses to yield to political expediency or changing fashion to win a single vote (a spin doctor's nightmare). Like character, like play--the work itself, written late in Shakespeare's career after he'd written all his best-known tragedies, is an unyielding, unbending drama about such a man, and the downward spiral his life takes, not long after enjoying a string of military victories. One might compare him to Richard III--Richard dissembles, manipulates, approaches every opponent and challenge by an indirect line (with his very body--as Shakespeare (brilliantly, I think) puts it--an indirect line). If they share anything it's a love of extremes, of the absolute: Richard for absolute power, Coriolanus for absolute honor.

4627172,4,B0059XTUR2,"Coriolanus (Ralph Fiennes, 2011)

I'll say it right up front: I'm a sucker for updated Shakespeare, those movies that Wm. Shak. purists wish had never been made. Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet? I'm crazy for it. Tim Blake Nelson's O, which transports Othello to a boarding school? Delicious. Ten Things I Hate About You, a Taming of the Shrew retelling that made a superstar out of the late Heath Ledger? Loved it. So it's almost bred in the bone that I was going to adore Ralph Fiennes' Coriolanus, set in an alternate-world Rome where bread is scarce. It took a brief conversation with a friend who wasn't as thrilled with it as I was for me to get a real handle on why I loved it as much as I did, but now I've got more insight--which, thankfully (or not, depending on your point of view), I can now share with you good people.

Plot: Caius Martius (played by Fiennes) is a Roman general, as we open held by the populace to be the bearer of the blame for the withholding of food stores. When confronted by a band of freedom fighters marching on the Central Distribution building, he expresses his contempt for the plebeians openly, while more diplomatic members of the government attempt to calm them. For his courage in facing the throng, Martius is named Coriolanus by Cominus, his commander, and his mother suggests he run for consul, an elected position. He bows to her wishes and does so; it seems he's going to win, as well, but the folks from the first scene reappear, stire up another riot, and cause him to have another blowup that turns the popular tide against him and ends with his banishment. He leaves Rome and offers himself up to rival commander Aufidius (300's Gerard Butler) in exhange for the chance to lead an all-out assault on Rome.

Coriolanus was one of the Shakespeare plays we read aloud in high school. You can imagine how well that went over; I liked it a great deal, but it always struck me as very cerebral, very detached, intellectual and strategic. That made sense, given that that's the mindset of military commanders (or, well, you'd think so) like Martius and Aufidius. Fiennes did not approach the material in that manner, however. I watched this in the same way I watched Willem Dafoe, playing Jesus, delivering the Sermon on the Mount in The Last Temptation of Christ; previous to seeing that scene, I had always envisioned the Sermon on the Mount being delivered in a bloodless monotone. (This has a lot to do with the various pastors I suffered as a child.) That was the first time I understood that perhaps it had been delivered with real passion. In the same way, Fiennes approached this material from a much more visceral standpoint, delivering it from the gut instead of from the head, as it were, and as a result I experienced Coriolanus in an entirely new way. (It also helps that this is the first time I've seen Gerard Butler in a film and seem him do something that actually looks like acting.) I was very impressed by this, and recommend it highly. *** ",1360022400,,3005,4.5799256505576205

This is a film adaptation of William Shakespeare's (1564 to 1616) play of the same name, written circa 1608.  (The play itself was written during Shakespeare's greatest period, 1599 to 1608).  This movie is also the directorial debut of actor Ralph Fiennes (who also co-produced).

Even though this movie is based on a ""Roman"" or ""political"" play, serious viewers will discover that it so much more. I found that it stayed with me long after I saw it.

This movie is set in a modern-day version of Rome.  It is essentially the story of warrior Caius Marcius (note that his last name is derived from the Roman god of war), later Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whose honour, pride, and sense of social rank essentially dominates his life and interferes with his ability to function effectively when he's not on the battlefield.

One of the great attributes of this movie and the play is that it does not have many characters and thus is easy to follow. The major characters are as follows:

(1) Caius Marcius Coriolanus (Ralph Fiennes): a valiant warrior and patrician (nobleman) with a non-overbearing wife. ""A soldier to Cato's wish"" and a modest hero who ""hath deserved worthily of his country"" but who lacks tact and refuses to placate ""the mutable, rank-scented many.""
(2) Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave): his overbearing mother. ""In anger, Juno-like.""
(3) Menenius Agrippa (Brian Cox): ""a humorous patrician"" and an old and true friend of Coriolanus who is trusted by the plebeians (lower class).
(4) Comenius (John Kani): a fellow general of Coriolanus.
(5) Sicinius (James Nesbitt) and Brutus (Paul Jesson): tribunes or representatives of the common people or plebians and Coriolanus' political enemies. ""A pair of strange ones.""
(6) Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler): general of Rome's enemies and rival in glory to Coriolanus.

This movie is ""visceral and visually stunning.""  (It was filmed in Serbia, Montenegro, and the UK.)  I found that the background music added to each scene.

All actors do good jobs in their roles but I have to give special kudos to both Ralph Fiennes and Vanessa Redgrave for their exceptional performances.

For those that may have difficulty with Elizabethan language, I would recommend first reading a plot outline of the actual play in order to get the full impact of this movie.

The actual DVD (the one released in 2012) has two worthy extras.

Finally, this is the only movie version of this play that I am aware of.

BOTTOMLINE:

This movie is a worthy addition to the Bard's cinematic canon.

4627175,4,B0059XTUR2,"Shakespeare is often better watched than read. Coriolanus is not as popular as most, but Ralph Fiennes thought it was time to present it on film, and it's an admirable job. Crowd scenes are well done, but the dialogue driven narrative is given good service by director/star Fiennes, abetted by an excellent cast including Vanessa Redgrave, Gerard Butlet, Jessica Chastain, and, especially, Brian Cox. It's not a pleasant tale, and the updated version isn't any more riveting than the script requires, but it's a true act-fest, a surplus of great performances.

I wouldn't buy the film for repeated viewings, but I'm quite satisfied to have seen this little known Shakespeare, done with flair and talent.

I'm especially impressed that Jessica Chastain appeared in 7 good films in 2011, in amazingly diverse roles (The Help, Tree of Life, Take Shelter, etc). She's definitely a talent on the rise.

I might also recommend Julie Taymor's TITUS. It was Shakespeare's most popular play during his lifetime, sadly forgotten now. Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange kick serious Shakespearian butt.",1359676800,,1090,5.217142857142857

After Amazon asked my opinion on this movie, I went back and scoured the reviews of people who scored it a ""1"".

Of the major film adaptations I really enjoyed As You Like it with Kevin Klein. Coriolanus is among my favorite of the lesser performed Shakespeare plays. Recently it has gained a bit of popularity. I saw a version of it performed at Portland Center Stage and was very happy. Gladly the OSF will be performing it soon.

Though this adaptation goes ultra modern, it still retains much of the spirit of the play. The main reason for a four instead of five star rating is that the performances are rather uneven. Fiennes is great, as always, but Gerard Butler can get a bit hammy. Brian Cox is an amazingly welcome surprise in his role. Vanessa Redgrave also gives a terrific performance.

If it weren't for the occasional uneven moment, I would give a higher rating. This is Fiennes' first directorial role if I am not mistaken. (perhaps that is why it can be uneven at times). It shows his talent in that direction as well. I look forward to more directorial roles of his. This is a modern adaptation that does resound with our current world situation at large.

4627264,4,B0059XTUR2,"I'm a fan of modern adaptations of Shakespeare, particularly ones that keep the Elizabethan-era dialogue.  Richard III, starring Sir Ian McKellan, does a marvelous job of moving the action of old England into a more modern setting, and I think Coriolanus does as well.  Though the play is set in Rome, director Ralph Fiennes brings it into a modernized Rome that's very reminiscent of wartime Sarajevo.  The setting and directing style are both very effective, and it seems to be that Fiennes has been taking a page out of Kathryn Bigelow's directing book; many of his shots, particularly during battle scenes, look visually simliar to hers in The Hurt Locker.  The cast is very strong, from Fiennes to Gerard Butler to the supporting cast, and they all do very well with the Shakespearean language.

Coriolanus isn't a particularly familiar play to most audiences; even as someone who's studied Shakespeare repeatedly in college and grad school, I've never read it, so I can see how the lack of familiarity might scare away some viewers.  And really, if you're not a Shakespeare fan, this probably isn't the movie for you.  It does keep the original language intact, but as long as you're paying attention, it's pretty easy to understand what they're saying.  It is modern English, just in an archaic style.

It must have been a difficult task, as it usually is when one needs to finance and produce an independent movie.

Figured I'd give it a chance anyway since the reviews were so glowing.  After this experience, I doubt I'll be delving into any more Shakespearean movies featuring authentic language.

Problem is, even with the subtitles on it's almost impossible to figure out what they're talking about.  Seems like it would've been much more effective to keep the soul of the film while using not only a modern setting but modern language.

Then, the crux of the story again makes no sense.  A war hero apparently wants to be a high-ranking official so he talks the commoners into naming him consul.

4627325,4,B0059XTUR2,"It's important to remember that Shakespeare wrote as a contemporary commentator on events and politics of the 17th century when he was writing his plays, so I see no problem in providing a contempary frame of reference for this film. And it is done very well. Yes, I have to say it took me a while to get into the rhythm of it, and if I was to be honest, the Elizabethan language counterpointed against the modern setting was something I never really was 100% comfortable with, but I enjoyed the little touches, as other people have noticed, the crawling news banners and Channel 4's Jon Snow playing himself.
I'm also trying to decide if it is overly self-indulgent, I suspect Ralph Fiennes is a bit of an ""uber-lovey"",(I mean, his name is spelt ""Ralph"" and pronounced ""Rafe"" {ffs!!}) and his direction and intensity of his performance might be considered a sort of ""write the theme tune, sing the theme tune"" look at me exercise, BUT..... the performance is intense, and gripping, and rather enjoyable.
My minor gripes were I felt were probably issues evolving from the need to reduce the film to a manageable length, and that was a little more in emphasising the antipathy between himself and the common people, and especially his decision to strand for political office, it just didn't seem right to me that such a reluctant politician went from hospital bed to senate in about 5 minutes.
Still, I am a reluctant Shakespearean as I was forced to study one of his less interesting plays at school, and perhaps if I had had something feeling more relevant to me, such as this adaptation, I would have enjoyed him more.",1347840000,,1620,4.687719298245614

Cayo Martius is the embodiment of the courage and bravery the vital sword of the nation. But his pride and unability -to assume the role of politician without hiding his reject for the masses - are at the same level of his courage, will mean for him the beginning of his fall.

His well justified rage - due his irreductible conviction - avoids him to think like a soldier, that's why his unability to act with political smell, doesn't allow him to understand his alliance with his hated enemy to fight against the new common enemy, and the fact to be convinced by the sallad tears of his mother and wife will be his epitaph.

Vanessa Redgrave is as always, unique and sublime. The scene in which we watch her to beg for Rome's sake will be reminded for the new generations to come: a true lesson of SUPERB ACTING.

Henry III on film done in the style of a 1930's dictatorship. A film version of Macbeth set as two opposing organized crime families. The Tragedy of Coriolanus is presented just as dramatically in fatigues , M16s and tanks as with togas, swords and chariots. Either you like Shakespeare tragedies or you don't.

4627367,5,B0059XTUR2,"Remaking the works of Shakespeare into films depicting more contemporary settings is not unheard of.  Luhrmann attempted it with Romeo and Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio (I thought Gnomeo and Juliet was better, personally), Taming the Shrew, etc.  Even British television took the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and recreated Sherlock Holmes in a modern setting with the beautifully rendered TV series Sherlock.  Needless to say, it's becoming somewhat of a trend.

Coriolanus continues this trend albeit with one of Shakespeare's more obscure works of the same name.  Starring a great cast consisting of Ralph Finnes, Gerard Butler, and Brian Cox, Coriolanus takes the audience to a contemporary version of Rome following the original source material very carefully and faithfully.  The acting is superb and you truly believe that Finnes is a classic tragic character worthy of Shakespeare.  I truly felt as though I was seeing Rome in contemporary times as the visuals and settings were very convincing.

There really isn't anything critical to say of the film other than it doesn't surprise the audience if they already know the story.  I researched the original story before watching and felt as though I could quote it nearly word for word (which the film did masterfully explain in the beginning) even more so Allen Moore's Watchmen.

All in all, a solid film for anyone wanting an artistic film but I don't think it'll appeal too much to the general audience: Shakespearean tragedies hardly ever do.",1344988800,,1506,5.135245901639344
4627368,4,B0059XTUR2,"I was drawn to this film for several reasons.

First, it's based on a Shakespearean play.

Second, I wasn't at all familiar with the storyline.  (Translate that to mean that I'd rather see some new Shakespeare rather than another retread of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" ""King Lear,"" ""Hamlet,"" ""Macbeth,"" ""Taming of the Shrew,"" or ""The Tempest.""  All good, but I've seen it all before, in numerous incarnations.  This is why ""Titus""--with Anthony Hopkins--appealed to me as well.

Third, it takes place in an historical period other than that used in Shakespeare's play.  In this case, the original play's setting is ancient Rome, but the movie's setting is a fictional, modern Rome, replete with modern Army uniforms and guns in the place of breastplates and swords.

Fourth, it stars Ralph Fiennes (also directing) and Gerard Butler.  While I had my doubts about Butler's Shakespearean abilities, his acting skills and range were very impressive.  Brian Cox and Vanessa Redgrave also star and give fine performances.

Overall, I appreciate a good Shakespearean production and ""Coriolanus"" did not disappoint.  While I realize that it's sometimes difficult/intimidating to select Shakespeare as a viewing choice due to the concentration you must pay (i.e. in order to understand the Elizabethan speech along with the storyline), I found ""Coriolanus"" fairly easy to follow.

4627404,4,B0059XTUR2,"I like to see a Shakespeare play updated to modern times.  This actor/director Ralfe Fiennes does with some success in Coriolanus - he takes a Sarajevo-like setting and calls it Rome.  The story revolves around an arrogant but very successful soldier, his arch-enemy and the wrath of political enemies.  Fiennes, in the lead role, does a great job of showing how unlikeable this man is.  Gerrard Butler puts in a wonderful performance as the arch-enemy to whom Coriolanus turns in order to get revenge on his fellow Romans after he is exiled from Rome because of the political intrigue as well as his total antipathy to the common people.

The film has a few surprises, in particular the wonderful performance by Vanessa Redgrave as the very proud, politically astute and ambitious mother of Coriolanus - it is she who has shaped the warrior and also his distaste for the common people.  In that lies the man's weakness.  There is also a bit of Oedipus in the story in the attachment of Coriolanus to his mother.

The film is wonderfully filmed and the battle scenes are graphic and realistic.

It only takes a few minutes to get the ear working on the old English language but it sounds wonderful and natural from all the actors.

4627408,4,B0059XTUR2,"Certainly fans of Shakespeare will love this film.  I suspect many action fans will as well.  First time director Ralph Fiennes puts himself in the lead role as Caius Martius (Coriolanus added as a surname midway through the film), a fierce general in the Roman army.  Now this setting isn't ancient Rome, but modern times.  This isn't the first time that Shakespeare plays have been reenacted on film using current settings with old-timey language.  ""Richard III"" and ""Romeo + Juliet"" come to mind.  Admittedly some will struggle with some of the archaic lingo, but hang in there. It gets easier.  Fortunately, the acting and the action fill in nicely for dialog you might have missed.

With goading from his high ranking and overly ambitions mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave), Coriolanus is pressed into service in the political Consul.  This isn't popular with the people as Coriolanus has always been an oppressor of the common man.  When he fails to get their support he causes a riot which results in his banishment from Rome.  Now he's pissed and leaves town for the Volscian territory whose army is close to an invasion of their Roman enemies.  The Volscians are lead by Aufidius (Gerard Butler).  After the two generals meet they plan their attack of Rome, although they have different objectives and rationale.  The film occasionally goes off the rails and some of the acting is over-the-top, but ultimately the film works.  The military scenes are shot with authority if not complete authenticity.  They are violent as is much of the movie.

The Blu ray transfer is 1080p with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  Interestingly enough Fiennes uses the same cinematographer (Barry Ackroyd) that worked on Oscar winner ""The Hurt Locker.""  The battle scenes are beautifully transferred and as you might expect, the audio (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1) is a winner, especially during these battle sequences.",1342396800,,1901,5.035256410256411
4627409,5,B0059XTUR2,"""Coriolanus,"" one of Shakespeare's lesser known works, makes a fine movie in this updated interpretation.  Ralph Fiennes plays the title character, a general who has been fighting battles for his country since the tender age of nine.  He has now returned to ""Rome,"" his country, which resembles a mid-20th century militarized South American state, and is urged by his ambitious, ruthless mother (a wonderful Vanessa Redgrave) to announce that he is now the leader of the republic.

In order to become leader, he has to perform a ritualistic foray to the people where he is supposed to declare his battle wounds that he has received on behalf of the republic. Here is where Coriolanus reveals his fatal flaw:  pride.  He finds that he feels that he is better than the citizens he is supposed to be wooing -- after all he is a battle-scarred brilliant general and they are, well, lesser human beings.  So when he is expected to actually show them his wounds, he balks.  His enemies soon convince the citizenry that his pride is treason, and Coriolanus finds himself a man without a country.  In his anger at his country's treachery towards him, he turns to his mortal enemy (played by sexy Gerard Butler) and makes a deal to turn on ""Rome.""

With action-packed battle sequences, dirty political dealings and inter-family turmoil, this film satisfies a modern sensibility while staying true to much of Shakespeare's Elizabethan language.  Fiennes, Redgrave and Butler turn in powerhouse performances.  This is a film you will want to watch more than once.

4627410,3,B0059XTUR2,"Modern-day takes on Shakespeare is not a new idea.  It's been done a thousand times over.  Sometimes it really shines and stands apart as a separate entity, and other times it crumbles under its own ambition and serves as a tent pole of what NOT to do when adapting classic literature.  Ralph Fiennes `Coriolanus' is somewhere in the middle.  It is far from a masterpiece and yet it lifts itself up when needed in order to create something far more intriguing than one may initially expect.  While I didn't walk away truly riveted (and the faults here run deep) I was certainly impressed with some of the steps Fiennes took to make this his own story.

Taking the Roman Empire and thrusting it into the modern-day atmosphere, Fiennes tells the story of General Caius Martius.  Martius is a very complicated figure.  Married to a mouse of a woman, governed by a bear of a mother and infatuated with a former comrade, Martius strives for greatness but his inborn selfishness paints him a monster before his people.  He is hated and plotted against and eventually exiled only to have his morality shift in a display of Shakespearian bravado.

The cast muddles through this dialog heavy adaptation that, much like 1996's `Romeo + Juliet', doesn't adjust dialog to fit the modern-day setting.  I am not one who initially cares about this.  I feel that Baz's take on Shakespeare was a masterpiece and possibly the best film of the 90's, and part of my infatuation was the stellar way he utilized Shakespeare's classic language.  Here though, moments feel stilted and almost cold thanks to the wording.  It feels hard to submit to and thus loses some of the emotional angst it needed to truly embrace the audience.  Another quibble here is mainly in the story itself, which is really segments of Shakespeare's best features strung along to create something `different' that doesn't feel very different and thus feels a bit forgettable.  The main character himself isn't very interesting and so the audience suffers from a bit of disconnect while trying to settle into the film itself.

Although, I will admit that the homoerotic overtones displayed between Martius and Aufidius were played expertly.

The cast as a whole was admirable.  Vanessa Redgrave carries her scenes with such ferocity that she literally swallows the rest of the cast whole, especially Jessica Chastain, who basically disappears behind the behemoth that is Redgrave.  Chastain has a stellar year, but this is a thankless role and a rather insignificant performance.  Fiennes is fiery and sells his character's more explosive moments, but his quieter scenes fail to really ignite.  Gerard Butler probably delivers his finest performance and actually proves he can act (something I was waiting to see) and so I'm happy to see him expand his resume with things of this sort, and Brian Cox is tremendous (second only to Redgrave).  Fiennes directs this rather well.  I felt that his use of the television was overdone and thus became a regurgitation of sorts and felt rather unnecessary, but the visual prowess of the action scenes (the fight between Martius and Aufidius was flawless).

So, yes...see this, but don't expect it to be groundbreaking.",1342137600,2,3211,4.9570093457943925

The film is set in the present, but they kept the Shakespearean language, which just seemed odd. (I know other films have done the same thing, and I didn't like that, either.) It also made things hard to follow. At times, I just wanted to yell, ""Speak in modern English, would you?""

I had trouble following the plot--perhaps if I'd read the play prior to seeing the film, I would have understood what was happening. Watching with captions helped, but I still struggled to understand why certain events happened. There's a ""making of"" documentary in the special features that helped clear up some of my confusion regarding what actually happened ... but I shouldn't need to watch the special features in order to understand the film!

4627433,5,B0059XTUR2,"CORIOLANUS is not one of Shakespeare's more familiar plays. To fully appreciate this wondrous screen adaptation by Josh Logan, placing the action in contemporary times with contemporary dress and weapons, it is helpful to recall the original story line, here quoted form Shakespeare in miniature. `Written between 1605 and 1608, the play opens in Rome shortly after the expulsion of the Tarquin kings. There are riots in progress, after stores of grain were withheld from ordinary citizens. The rioters are particularly angry at Caius Martius (Ralph Finnes), a brilliant Roman general whom they blame for the grain being taken away. The rioters encounter a patrician named Menenius (Brian Cox), as well as Caius Martius himself. Menenius tries to calm the rioters, while Martius is openly contemptuous, and says that the plebeians were not worthy of the grain because of their lack of military service. Two of the tribunes of Rome, Brutus (Paul Jesson) and Sicinius (James Nesbitt), privately denounce Martius. He leaves Rome after news arrives that a Volscian army is in the field.

The commander of the Volscian army, Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler), has fought Martius on several occasions and considers him a blood enemy. The Roman army is commanded by Cominius (John Kani), with Martius as his deputy. While Cominius takes his soldiers to meet Aufidius' army, Martius leads a rally against the Volscian city of Corioles. The siege of Corioles is initially unsuccessful, but Martius is able to force open the gates of the city, and the Romans conquer it. Even though he is exhausted from the fighting, Martius marches quickly to join Cominius and fight the other Volscian force. Martius and Aufidius meet in single combat, which only ends when Aufidius' own soldiers drag him away from the battle. In recognition of his great courage, Cominius gives Caius Martius the title of `Coriolanus'. When they return to Rome, Coriolanus' mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave) encourages her son to run for consul. Coriolanus is hesitant to do this, but he bows to his mother's wishes. He effortlessly wins the support of the Roman Senate, and seems at first to have won over the commoners as well. However, Brutus and Sicinius scheme to undo Coriolanus and whip up another riot in opposition to his becoming consul. Faced with this opposition, Coriolanus flies into a rage and rails against the concept of popular rule. He compares allowing plebeians to have power over the patricians to allowing ""crows to peck the eagles"". The two tribunes condemn Coriolanus as a traitor for his words, and order him to be banished. Coriolanus retorts that it is he who banishes Rome from his presence.

After being exiled from Rome, Coriolanus seeks out Aufidius in the Volscian capital of Antium, and offers to let Aufidius kill him in order to spite the country that banished him. Moved by his plight and honoured to fight alongside the great general, Aufidius and his superiors embrace Coriolanus, and allow him to lead a new assault on the city. Rome, in its panic, tries desperately to persuade Coriolanus to halt his crusade for vengeance, but both Cominius and Menenius fail. Finally, Volumnia is sent to meet with her son, along with Coriolanus' wife Virgilia (Jessica Chastain) and child, and a chaste gentlewoman Valeria (Elizabeta Djorevska). Volumnia succeeds in dissuading her son from destroying Rome, and Coriolanus instead concludes a peace treaty between the Volscians and the Romans. When Coriolanus returns to the Volscian capital, conspirators, organized by Aufidius, kill him for his betrayal.

Actor-director Ralph Fiennes manages to move this compelling story into modern times, a move that not only heightens the intensity of the tale but allows us to make comparison with such current movements as the Occupy Movement. It is a brutal movie, retaining the Shakespeare language as enunciated with great success by this superlative cast. Fiennes delivers a brilliant portrayal of the man-to-dragon-to-humble man with such conviction that we are with him through every aspect of his troubled concept of leadership. The remainder of the cast is also extraordinary as is the cinematography by Barry Ackroyd and the spare musical score by Ilan Eshkeri. This is a film that should have been up toward the top of the Oscar nominees. If more people experienced this cinematic version there could be a significant increase in degree of Shakespeare's works in today's theaters. Highly recommended.

4627434,4,B0059XTUR2,"Superb acting by Vanessa Redgrave and Ralph Fiennes makes this one of the best Shakespeare films to come out in years. By placing the action in modern-day Rome, complete with ""breaking news"" on TV, Fiennes makes it clear that this tragic tale of pride, power, loyalty, and manipulation is timeless. Who should have a political voice? By what authority do our leaders rule? Where is the line between populism and demagoguery? Between rhetoric and pandering? These questions are as crucial today as they were when Shakespeare wrote the play in the 17th century*, and when Livy, Plutarch, and others told the story in antiquity.

I just found it ponderously slow.  Way too many long close up shots of faces, barren Serbian landscapes, war-ravaged cities.  In all, I can recommend it for Shakespeare fans willing to cut it some slack.

4627437,5,B0059XTUR2,"The remoteness of Shakespeare's language often obstructs the immediacy of his ideas, but with this version of Coriolanus Ralph Fiennes, Gerard Butler, Vanessa Regrave, Brian Cox, and the entire supporting cast make Shakespeare's words so palpably understandable that for a moment we feel this is how people really speak today.

Actors often overplay their lines when performing Shakespeare, and with good reason. How can anyone studying a Shakespeare play not be humbled by it? Actors perform with a strength and gusto matching their understanding of the play, so they often become unnatural, unfamiliar, alien, and remote.

In directing Coriolanus, Ralph Fiennes guides every single actor towards turning Shakespeare's lines into natural exchanges without changing the original language at all. Any written play, even one by Shakespeare, is nothing more than the blueprint for its performance. Only when all the parts are assembled before us do we have a full play, or in this case a full film. The actors here all deliver understated performances. They trust their audience to feel the power of Shakespeare's words and forego amplifying it; they pour all their talent into the language of their bodies and the tone of their voices.

This is the main strength of this film. By focusing on natural delivery, this Coriolanus reminds us that Shakespeare knows people inside out and so he knows you and me inside out. Also, by setting Coriolanus in a contemporary European war theater, Fiennes shows us that Shakespeare's ideas and themes are still relevant. The will to power and the pride of men have not changed much since his day.

Others are sometimes put off by attempts to place the Bard's work in more modern settings, but when you get down to the heart of it, Shakespeare is Shakespeare; the powerful lines and insight into humanity always come to the fore when directors stay true to the text.  Fiennes does this in Coriolanus, and he also offers a downright intimidating performance as Martius.

For those who were not lit majors:  Please don't be put off by the Elizabethan English of Shakespeare.  Just watch the first fifteen minutes of this film, and I promise you will be drawn in by the gut-wrenching tension which is held taut throughout the film.",1341100800,2,719,4.813008130081301
4627471,4,B0059XTUR2,"At first I was on the fence when I saw the trailers for this film never really been much of a Shakespeare fan.  So with that in mind it is the only reason I gave it four stars, it deserves 5 but in the beginning when they started talking in Shakespeare's verse took me a good ten or fifteen minutes for my brain to kick in to follow the dialogue and understand what they were saying.  It took me by surprise to say the least.

As far as the movie goes once you get used to the dialogue and realize its prose and not script than you can sit back and enjoy the masterpiece.  Its a legendary tale of Martius Coriolanus that Shakespeare wrote about more or less based off the man that Tacitus spoke of that lived in the fifth century BC.  But its all set in Modern Day which makes it that much more vivid and realistic.  The politics, the pandering, honor and betrayal, tyranny and revenge, and as all Shakespearean things go you end with Tragedy.

And that's the beauty of the film its gritty but beautiful.  Its brutal yet kind.  Something that only Shakespeare could pull off, so that alone sets the movie apart from current day Hollywood flicks.  In a way it somewhat correlates to the 1996 adaptation of Romeo and Juliet starring DiCaprio, in which they depicted it in modern times.

So if your in the mood for some prose, some grit, some blood, zero romance, betrayal, backstabbing, a hero turned into a pariah, then by all means sit down and enjoy.",1340928000,,1451,4.376865671641791
4627472,4,B0059XTUR2,"Actor Ralph Fiennes chose ""Coriolanus"", a Shakespearean play that resonates in light of contemporary politics, for his first directorial effort. A city called Rome suffers a grain shortage, leading to civil unrest, while its most able military leader, General Caius Martius (Ralph Fiennes), deals Aufidius (Gerard Butler), commander of the invading Volscians, a resounding defeat. For this, he is heralded in Rome, given the name ""Coriolanus"" to commemorate his great battle, and elevated to Consul by the Senate. But two tribunes, Brutus (Paul Jesson) and Sicinius (James Nesbitt), conspire to turn the common people against Coriolanus by playing on his open contempt for common values and fear of populist power.

Filmed in Serbia and decked out in modern technologies, ""Coriolanus"" evokes the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s with its very personal animosities, violence in close quarters, and civilian victims. It is both respectful of the people's will and cynical in its view of popular uprising, which is likely to elicit comparisons to the ""Occupy"" movement or ""Arab Spring."" The common people may have reason to distrust Coriolanus, as he makes no secret of his opinion that they are fickle, hypocritical, and a threat to the Senate -and therefore to the public good. Coriolanus may not be wrong, but nor are the people wrong to fear a hegemony of military demagogues and political elites. They are, however, easily manipulated, petty, and sometimes short-sighted.

Coriolanus is arrogant but a great military strategist and warrior willing to sacrifice all for his country. What he expects in return is his country's love and gratitude, and, when he is denied that, perhaps unjustly, the anger and hatred he feels at the betrayal can hardly be contained. Coriolanus is stalwart, strong, and principled in his own way but oddly vulnerable, needy, and susceptible to the piercing words of his great mother. For all his faults, it may be his honor that dooms him. Ralph Fiennes' portrayal does not want for nuance. Coriolanus is detestable, admirable, and tragic. Vanessa Redgrave's portrayal of his imposing and ambitious mother Volumnia is one of the most memorable of her long and magnificent career. Shakespeare gave her great lines, but she steals every scene she's in.

The DVD (Weinstein 2012): Bonus features are ""The Making of Coriolanus"" (6 min), which interviews Ralph Fiennes about acting and directing the movie and interviews some other cast, and an audio commentary by actor/director Ralph Fiennes. This commentary offers scene-by-scene analysis and is constant, but it includes limited technical information, concentrating instead on story and characters. Fiennes probably didn't need to explicate quite so much about the story, but he explains his intentions, decisions, compares the film to the play, and talks about characters as well. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.",1340928000,,2920,5.316017316017316
4627473,3,B0059XTUR2,"Since I wasn't a fan of the Romeo & Juliet rehash with Leonardo DiCaprio it should come as no surprise this movie wasn't my favorite.  Far too often the language used and the delivery, not to mention Butler's thick accent and saliva surplus, left me and fellow viewers with furrowed brows and confused, ""What was that?""-looks.  It just seems stupid to speak of drawing swords when shooting AR-15s, RPGs, and having one-on-one battles shortended by mortar explosions (which obviously wasn't in Shakespeare's original).  The anachronism is just not enjoyable.  If changes are necessary, then make them wholesale.

On the positive side, Ralph Fiennes absolutely explodes as war hero turned Senate hopeful Coriolanus.  His delivery is somewhere between a rabid Benedict Arnold and a hyperactive Colonel Kurtz.  I enjoyed his performance, even the parts I couldn't understand that well.

Those who loved R&J redux, you will probably like this.  Otherwise, I'd advise you to pass.",1340928000,3,974,5.2727272727272725
4627474,4,B0059XTUR2,"The trailers for Ralph Fiennes' directorial debut CORIOLANUS are deceptive, and if there had not been the indication that this was a work of Shakespeare, most would have been under the impression this was a film about a current conflict filled with battle sequences and political strife.

Apart from the ""current"" part, they'd be right on.

CORIOLANUS is a powerful tale of General Gaius Martius (Fiennes), a powerful and great soldier for Rome whose sole purpose in life is that of waging war. He cares nothing for the citizens of Rome that he fights for, and he makes that very clear in early scenes of the film. His mother Volumina (Vanessa Redgrave) has great pride in forging a warrior of such ferocity and strength. His wife Virgilia (Jessica Chastain) loves him without really understanding him. The only true friend he has is Senator Menenius (Brian Cox), who loves Martius, warts and all. But absent the love of the people, he takes to war, battling the Volscian threat to Rome led by Aufidius (Gerard Butler), a strong, almost Che Guevara-type of revolutionary. Martius ends up on his own on the Volscian's turf and kills many Volscians and finally squares off against Aufidius. Their fight becomes a draw amidst the chaos around them, but Rome declares Aufidius defeated and looks to Martius, now called Coriolanus because of the city where this battle took place, to become consul, a move wholeheartedly supported by his family and friends, but not to the joy of the people and members of the Roman senate whose positions are threatened by Coriolanus' rise. The serpentine manuverining of Tribunes Brutus (Paul Jesson) and Sicinius (James Nesbitt) moves Coriolanus into an indefensible position of making his feelings of the common people of Rome known to all. This hurls Coriolanus into exile, and after some time, he seeks the aid of the Volscians and particularly Aufidius himself to help him exact his revenge on Rome.

What makes this film so strong and impassioned is most of the performances and the filmmakers' brilliant work in adapting and modernizing this work without changing the language or the intent of the piece. It's set in present day amongst the 24-hour news cycle which acts as the chorus of this film (and as an easter egg of sorts, the TV station's name is Fidelus), examining the man Martius and his deeds. The use of modern war machines and weapons and with Fiennes' direction, the brilliant cinematography of Barry Ackroyd (who's done other great work on Kathryn Bigelow's THE HURT LOCKER, and Paul Greengrass' UNITED 93 and GREEN ZONE) and John Logan's (GLADIATOR, THE LAST SAMURAI) adapted screenplay, the film is given even greater urgency, a skillful reworking and a more unsettling comparison with our own society. The most visceral scene is the great battle scene which Fiennes and Ackroyd handle with scope and great excitement and tension. The intimate moments work just as well. Frankly I wasn't surprised at how well this film was created visually, even with it being Fiennes' directorial debut. Fiennes is one of our very best actors, and he has moved even more forward in deserved esteem with a striking first film. Another sad star of this film is the use of Croatia as the location. The desolation and destruction are the perfect setting for this tale, but reminds of the reality that still affects that ground to this very day.

From a performance standpoint, this is where the film does sway a little from what would normally be a five-star film to a four-star one. Fiennes is absolutely great as Martius. He plays him as a man who would not have political office because of the politics involved, and finds a greater comfort in the arms of his greatest enemy than that of his wife. Cox continues his hitting streak of great performances and remains a horrifically underrated character actor who is deserving of much more acclaim. His love for Martius is evident even as, as demonstrated in one of the most powerful moments of the film, Martius turns away from the life he once had. The brightest star here is Redgrave who gives an unnaturally brilliant and impassioned performance as mother Volumina, who always looks to take her son to the heights she knows he deserves, and never sways from that belief, even if he does. Chastain, one of the hardest working women in films right now, with films like THE TREE OF LIFE, THE HELP, THE DEBT and this, is cast well as the soft, almost demure wife Virgilia, but in fairness, she seems to be more there for her look of softness rather than her skill because she doesn't have much to do in this adaptation. James Nesbitt, who I've loved for a long time with Steven Moffat's TV show JEKYLL, in Paul Greengrass' BLOODY SUNDAY and lately in FIVE MINUTES OF HEAVEN, plays Sicinius with just the right amount of falseness and fear. Sadly, the poorest showing here is Gerard Butler who I have loved when he was in the right role. I've followed his career since the guilty pleasure DRACULA 2000 and through similarly not-too-good films like TIMELINE and REIGN OF FIRE until he exploded on the scene with 300. He was an actor that seemed to shine far above his co-stars in all of his scenes. Then suddenly, he became the go-to guy for sentimental rom-coms or action rom-coms or just general garbage, so I was thrilled to see someone wanting to take Butler seriously as an actor, especially someone like Fiennes. The shock of his performance in this film is that he holds his own quite well in the scenes with Fiennes, which shows why Fiennes cast him, but it's in most of his other scenes in which he doesn't seem to really find his rhythm with the character of Aufidius. However, the scene in which Aufidius proclaims his love and respect for Martius is a stunner.

Most people, myself occasionally included, are thrown off by the Bard's tongue. Listening to the precision in which he uses language and the good ol' Iambic Pentameter, people are generally turned off to Shakespeare if they haven't studied it. The problem with that is, that in a general sense, it's not the audience that should be afraid of not understanding it; it's the players and the director that should be afraid of not making it understandable and accessable to everyone. Shakespeare's work was never written for the elite during his era; it was written for the poor and played by and large in what most would consider a community theatre production. Nowadays, we get the feeling that Shakespeare is only for learned people. The onus is not as much on us but the performers and director in communicating this language and the meaning behind it to us without simply rewriting it and somehow making it more easily understandable for modern audiences. Since CORIOLANUS is also without a particularly relatable protagonist, since most of our main characters exist in a morally ambiguous grey area, this is also problematic for audiences, but it actually makes the characters more interesting because they're not cut from the same cloth as your traditional hero or villain. I can also sense that Fiennes and Logan had a difficult time determining what kind of film this was going to marketed as; Shakepearean tragedy or primal war film? This is not necessarily a fault of the film, but let's face it: Shakespeare isn't easy to sell, especially if it's one of his least famous works. This may account for Logan and Fiennes really trimming this down to a slender 2 hour run-time. It cuts directly to the meat of the tale, and it still works well, but I did sense a lack of material that might have made things more focused. I'm looking forward to seeing this on Blu-Ray (saw it through Amazon Instant Video through my PS3), because I'm very interested in hearing Fiennes' commentary on the film.

CORIOLANUS is very powerful storytelling, and mostly very powerful acting, and is very worthwhile to anyone who is a fan of the Bard or just a fan of terrific filmmaking.",1340755200,,7926,4.802930402930403

4627511,4,B0059XTUR2,"Superb performances by a distinguished cast redeem this sometimes over-stylized and stagy adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""Coriolanus"".  Ralph Fiennes, who also directed and co-produced, plays the title character, a war hero whose country turns on him, leading him to make a pact with an enemy (the magnificent Gerard Butler) who seeks to conquer Fiennes' homeland.  It falls to Coriolanus' wife (Jessica Chastain), mother (Vanessa Redgrave), and young son - all of whom have remained behind in their native land - to persuade the proud warrior not to exact a terrible revenge on his unfaithful countrymen.

The screenplay by John Logan resets Shakespeare's plot in modern times, but retains the anachronistic yet poetic sensibility of the Bard's dialogue.  Thus you have characters who are dressed in modern day clothing, utilizing sophisticated weaponry in modernized settings, but making incongruously flowery speeches.  The effect is oftentimes jarring, and detracts from the performances, with one notable exception: Vanessa Redgrave plays the role of Volumnia with consummate skill, modulating her vocal inflections and tone so adroitly that her meaning is always clear, regardless of the words she may be mouthing.  She deservedly won the Supporting Actress honors from the San Francisco Film Critics and the British Independent Spirit Awards for her work in this film, and should have received nominations for the Golden Globe and Oscar statuettes.

All in all, ""Coriolanus"" is an interesting film despite its flaws, and is well worth a look, particularly for fans of Fiennes, Butler, Redgrave, Chastain, and Brian Cox.  Devotees of Shakespeare and war films will also find much to like here; other audiences may not find themselves so intrigued.",1340150400,,1758,5.461254612546125

However, most people only know the story as a result of one of Shakespeare's lesser plays.  That someone would watch a film by the title of Coriolanus and be surprised that it is Shakespeare is pretty amusing to me.  Obviously the ignorant masses are not only to be found in ancient Rome.
Usually, putting Shakespeare in a modern setting is a disaster.  I saw Hamlet presented as corporate types in business suits, and it was just plain stupid.  However, this movie works well.  Having a TV anchor providing some of the dialogue was especially amusing.  I really don't know why this version of Coriolanus worked, but it was quite exjoyable.",1340064000,,940,4.8742138364779874
4627513,3,B0059XTUR2,"Ralph Fiennes is a well known actor made more famous for playing the arch enemy of Harry Potter, Lord Vole mort, in that series of films. Surprisingly that's the most famous thing he's remembered for. Forgotten are the roles he played in QUIZ SHOW, THE ENGLISH PATIENT or RED DRAGON. So it's nice to see him return to something away from the Potter universe once more.

CORIALANUS is based on the lesser known Shakespeare play concerning the main character of the same name. But Fiennes has also taken on the role of director here and chosen to situate the story not in Shakespearean times but in the modern world, a world where wars are fought on a daily basis and bloodshed and politics are strange bedfellows. Caius Martius (Fiennes) is a solider of high standing whose escapades inspire his men and who is hailed as the warrior in chief by politicians, especially Menenius (Brian Cox). But not everyone loves this warrior.

Among those who fear and hate him are the rabble rousers whose job it is to do nothing more than stir up trouble against the status quo. This group knows less about what they really want and more about protesting than most. They are represented by politicians whose desire is for nothing more than power while preaching that they have their good will in mind. Martius remains a warrior, a man whose life is pledged to defend his country. At the same time his contempt for those he considers beneath him shines through in his every word.

Leading the rebels is Tullus Aufidious (Gerard Butler), a man who is passionate not about his social standing or the will of politicians but a true leader who wants what is best for his people. While Martius has a respect based on fear from his men, Aufidius has respect based on the love of his people. These two have collided more than once and will do so again and again until only one stands.

After a serious battle Martius is put forward to drop his warrior role and take on that of a statesman. To show their gratitude the politicians rename him Caius Martius Corialanus after the town of his last victory. Menenius sees the potential he has for this role as does his mother (Vanessa Redgrave), an overbearing woman whose own status lies in the role of her son. But Martius doesn't have the skill for politics rather saying what he believes and thinks instead of what they want him to say. His reward for his service to country is to be betrayed by the politicians who sought to use him for their own devices. Martius finds himself banished from his own country and sets out to find his destiny.

That path leads him to Aufidious and the rebels. Martius sees first hand what their life is like. He witnesses what role Aufidious plays in the lives of his people. In so doing he realizes that he must seek revenge on those who did him wrong.

The character of Corialanus is a tragic one as were most of Shakespeare's characters. Here we have a man who has dedicated his life and based his career on the country he loves only to find himself cast out by them. Eventually even the love of his mother is called to question as the film heads for the final reel.

By setting the film in the present, Fiennes has attempted to bring new life into the classic work of its author. Much of the dialogue fits well within this setting, discussions of warrior spirit and the like. The war torn streets seem recognizable as those of European world where fighting continues to this day. It becomes believable. And the actions of politicians who do little more than seek power fits so well into the current world that one wonders how many acts displayed here take place daily in the halls of power.

This may not be enough to gain popularity for the movie or for Shakespeare. But then it might open the world of the author for younger viewers who never seem to want to take a chance on anything considered classic, instead opting only for what's new. But if you enjoy the words and writings of Shakespeare then you'll want to give this one a watch. If not, watch anyway to make a better equipped judgment.

4627516,5,B0059XTUR2,"This is a magnificent film that does an incredible job of making one of Shakespeare's most difficult, least sympathetic tragic heroes -- not to mention one of his most challenging plays, period -- readily accessible to the modern audience. It's remarkable how Fiennes and company have translated the story and language to the modern world. The way the occasional television news commentators speak Shakespeare's text is almost enough to cause one to think that he had CNN in mind when he wrote it. And Fiennes's portrayal of Coriolanus makes me recall my college Shakespeare professor's evocative characterization of a true tragic hero: a lion chained down in the middle of the road, pulling at the chains, trying desperately to escape the steamroller approaching him, but who, when he realizes he cannot escape, turns around and charges the steamroller.

My only complaint has nothing to do with the film itself but rather with its DVD extras, which are meager. The ""making of"" bonus feature is almost laughably brief, coming to an abrupt, almost jarring end just when it was really starting to get good. And Fiennes's own running commentary on the film is interesting enough but unexceptional. It would have been nice to hear from Butler, Redgrave, and/or Cox as well.

Still, I don't buy Shakespeare films for the extras. Even if there were no bonus features at all, I would still highly recommend ""Coriolanus."" It's the Bard on steroids, but without the brain damage sometimes attributed to such performance-enhancing drugs.",1339891200,3,1528,5.108
4627517,5,B0059XTUR2,"Ralph Fiennes' ""Coriolanus"" is a persuasive and thrilling modern-dress version of Shakespeare, ranking with Richard Loncraine's 1995 ""Richard III"" starring Ian McKellen. Whereas Loncraine turned Richard into Hitler and the War of the Roses into World War II, Fiennes takes the 5th Century B.C. milieu of Coriolanus and transmutes it to the Bosnian wars of the 1990s--a fitting backdrop for the thorny ambiguities of ""Coriolanus,"" a play which has no heroes. Coriolanus (Fiennes) is not a lovable character--violent, vindictive, rigid, contemptuous of lesser mortals--but, alone among the play's characters, he is always true to himself and his inner sense of justice and virtue. For that, in a world defined by political backstabbing, he must pay the ultimate price.

Working with screenwriter John Logan (""Gladiator,""), Fiennes creates an admirably streamlined ""Coriolanus,"" deftly adding AK-47s and telecommunications to the ancient story. Fiennes is fiercely brilliant in the title role, but the standout performance is by Vanessa Redgrave as Coriolanus' mother Volumnia, as frightening a portrait of motherhood as has ever been put on screen. There also are admirable performances by Brian Cox as Menenius, Coriolanus' only true friend and the only character in the play who could be considered likable; James Nesbitt and Paul Jesson as the corrupt senators who turn the mob against Coriolanus; and Gerard Butler as Aufinius, Coriolanus' mortal enemy, locked in a mutual hatred with Coriolanus so all-encompassing that it becomes a perverse kind of love.",1339891200,,1558,5.546218487394958

I appreciate that they were trying to do something different... an edgy Shakespeare set in modern times. However, it just didn't resonate with me. The language felt awkward and inappropriate, especially from Gerard Butler (and his thick Scottish accent). It isn't that I have an aversion to Shakespeare. Certainly not! In fact, I really enjoyed the movie Titus with Anthony Hopkins. But I suppose I prefer my Shakespeare language in a period film, with frilly collar costumes, when it doesn't feel a bit strange and laughable.

In fact, I was watching the movie with my sister, and she DID laugh. She said the movie, ""missed the mark"" and I couldn't agree with her more.

4627563,4,B0059XTUR2,"The trailers for Ralph Fiennes' directorial debut CORIOLANUS are deceptive, and if there had not been the indication that this was a work of Shakespeare, most would have been under the impression this was a film about a current conflict filled with battle sequences and political strife.

Apart from the ""current"" part, they'd be right on.

CORIOLANUS is a powerful tale of General Gaius Martius (Fiennes), a powerful and great soldier for Rome whose sole purpose in life is that of waging war. He cares nothing for the citizens of Rome that he fights for, and he makes that very clear in early scenes of the film. His mother Volumina (Vanessa Redgrave) has great pride in forging a warrior of such ferocity and strength. His wife Virgilia (Jessica Chastain) loves him without really understanding him. The only true friend he has is Senator Menenius (Brian Cox), who loves Martius, warts and all. But absent the love of the people, he takes to war, battling the Volscian threat to Rome led by Aufidius (Gerard Butler), a strong, almost Che Guevara-type of revolutionary. Martius ends up on his own on the Volscian's turf and kills many Volscians and finally squares off against Aufidius. Their fight becomes a draw amidst the chaos around them, but Rome declares Aufidius defeated and looks to Martius, now called Coriolanus because of the city where this battle took place, to become consul, a move wholeheartedly supported by his family and friends, but not to the joy of the people and members of the Roman senate whose positions are threatened by Coriolanus' rise. The serpentine manuverining of Tribunes Brutus (Paul Jesson) and Sicinius (James Nesbitt) moves Coriolanus into an indefensible position of making his feelings of the common people of Rome known to all. This hurls Coriolanus into exile, and after some time, he seeks the aid of the Volscians and particularly Aufidius himself to help him exact his revenge on Rome.

What makes this film so strong and impassioned is most of the performances and the filmmakers' brilliant work in adapting and modernizing this work without changing the language or the intent of the piece. It's set in present day amongst the 24-hour news cycle which acts as the chorus of this film (and as an easter egg of sorts, the TV station's name is Fidelus), examining the man Martius and his deeds. The use of modern war machines and weapons and with Fiennes' direction, the brilliant cinematography of Barry Ackroyd (who's done other great work on Kathryn Bigelow's THE HURT LOCKER, and Paul Greengrass' UNITED 93 and GREEN ZONE) and John Logan's (GLADIATOR, THE LAST SAMURAI) adapted screenplay, the film is given even greater urgency, a skillful reworking and a more unsettling comparison with our own society. The most visceral scene is the great battle scene which Fiennes and Ackroyd handle with scope and great excitement and tension. The intimate moments work just as well. Frankly I wasn't surprised at how well this film was created visually, even with it being Fiennes' directorial debut. Fiennes is one of our very best actors, and he has moved even more forward in deserved esteem with a striking first film. Another sad star of this film is the use of Croatia as the location. The desolation and destruction are the perfect setting for this tale, but reminds of the reality that still affects that ground to this very day.

From a performance standpoint, this is where the film does sway a little from what would normally be a five-star film to a four-star one. Fiennes is absolutely great as Martius. He plays him as a man who would not have political office because of the politics involved, and finds a greater comfort in the arms of his greatest enemy than that of his wife. Cox continues his hitting streak of great performances and remains a horrifically underrated character actor who is deserving of much more acclaim. His love for Martius is evident even as, as demonstrated in one of the most powerful moments of the film, Martius turns away from the life he once had. The brightest star here is Redgrave who gives an unnaturally brilliant and impassioned performance as mother Volumina, who always looks to take her son to the heights she knows he deserves, and never sways from that belief, even if he does. Chastain, one of the hardest working women in films right now, with films like THE TREE OF LIFE, THE HELP, THE DEBT and this, is cast well as the soft, almost demure wife Virgilia, but in fairness, she seems to be more there for her look of softness rather than her skill because she doesn't have much to do in this adaptation. James Nesbitt, who I've loved for a long time with Steven Moffat's TV show JEKYLL, in Paul Greengrass' BLOODY SUNDAY and lately in FIVE MINUTES OF HEAVEN, plays Sicinius with just the right amount of falseness and fear. Sadly, the poorest showing here is Gerard Butler who I have loved when he was in the right role. I've followed his career since the guilty pleasure DRACULA 2000 and through similarly not-too-good films like TIMELINE and REIGN OF FIRE until he exploded on the scene with 300. He was an actor that seemed to shine far above his co-stars in all of his scenes. Then suddenly, he became the go-to guy for sentimental rom-coms or action rom-coms or just general garbage, so I was thrilled to see someone wanting to take Butler seriously as an actor, especially someone like Fiennes. The shock of his performance in this film is that he holds his own quite well in the scenes with Fiennes, which shows why Fiennes cast him, but it's in most of his other scenes in which he doesn't seem to really find his rhythm with the character of Aufidius. However, the scene in which Aufidius proclaims his love and respect for Martius is a stunner.

Most people, myself occasionally included, are thrown off by the Bard's tongue. Listening to the precision in which he uses language and the good ol' Iambic Pentameter, people are generally turned off to Shakespeare if they haven't studied it. The problem with that is, that in a general sense, it's not the audience that should be afraid of not understanding it; it's the players and the director that should be afraid of not making it understandable and accessable to everyone. Shakespeare's work was never written for the elite during his era; it was written for the poor and played by and large in what most would consider a community theatre production. Nowadays, we get the feeling that Shakespeare is only for learned people. The onus is not as much on us but the performers and director in communicating this language and the meaning behind it to us without simply rewriting it and somehow making it more easily understandable for modern audiences. Since CORIOLANUS is also without a particularly relatable protagonist, since most of our main characters exist in a morally ambiguous grey area, this is also problematic for audiences, but it actually makes the characters more interesting because they're not cut from the same cloth as your traditional hero or villain. I can also sense that Fiennes and Logan had a difficult time determining what kind of film this was going to marketed as; Shakepearean tragedy or primal war film? This is not necessarily a fault of the film, but let's face it: Shakespeare isn't easy to sell, especially if it's one of his least famous works. This may account for Logan and Fiennes really trimming this down to a slender 2 hour run-time. It cuts directly to the meat of the tale, and it still works well, but I did sense a lack of material that might have made things more focused. I'm looking forward to seeing this on Blu-Ray (saw it through Amazon Instant Video through my PS3), because I'm very interested in hearing Fiennes' commentary on the film.

CORIOLANUS is very powerful storytelling, and mostly very powerful acting, and is very worthwhile to anyone who is a fan of the Bard or just a fan of terrific filmmaking.",1339286400,2,7926,4.802930402930403

4627565,4,B0059XTUR2,"First of all, I watched this with my husband who doesn't really like Shakespearean plays or movies but does like action movies and actors like Ralph (pronounced RAFE, I found out) Fiennes and Gerard Butler.  For most action movies he prefers no closed captioning but I wish that we HAD chosen closed captioning because when we added it for the last third of the movie, it was much more enjoyable (and understandable).  Gerard spoke with his natural heavy Scottish brogue and, since the movie was made partly in Serbia, there were actors who had those accents as well and were not always understandable.  When I watch it again I will use close captioning for the whole movie.

It was a good story but I had not read or seen the play The Tragedy of Coriolanus before.  I found, before watching Mel Gibson's Hamlet with my college English class in the early 90's, reading the annotated play and discussing it in class made a big difference in understanding and enjoying that movie. So...I suggest reading Shakespeare's The Tragedy of Coriolanus for increased understanding and enjoyment watching the movie.  At least choose closed captioning.

Each actor really was great -- only a little chewing of the scenery was done by Mr. Fiennes, Ms. Redgrave and Mr. Butler but it was apropos for the scenes.

I won't tell the story, others have already done so, but I will tell you there is a short Making of (with closed captioning) which was enjoyable and informative, and a feature commentary by the actor/director Ralph Fiennes (his first time), which I did not listen to as yet.  For a first movie, I think Mr. Fiennes was a success.  Also I viewed the DVD version which I received as a Vine member and it was extremely clear and sharp played on my Blu-ray player (Sony). I forgot it wasn't an HD movie.

The movie is worth renting or buying -- it just different because the language is that of William Shakespeare (1564-1616).  The King James Version of the Holy Bible was translated starting in 1604 and finished in 1611.  It helps if you do read the original version regularly -- the language is similar.",1339286400,,2101,4.692098092643052
4627566,5,B0059XTUR2,"Coriolanus,Shakespeare's last tragedy,is his most political play. Ralph Fiennes,an aloof, cerebral actor,has made an arresting directorial debut, playing the lead role,updating it to a contemporary setting in the Balkans. A warrior code prevails in an oppressively, oligarchical state. Shakespeare alludes to the grain riots of his own times. Fiennes depicts the widespread riots of a furious mob complaining about prices,food shortages, their fury becomes focused on the Republic's most famous general,Caius Martius(Fiennes).John Logan has managed to retain the power of Shakespeare's language,but stripped it down to an active,plot-driven mode. Fiennes concentrates on the context,the situation,the economic uncertainty,the continual war,conflict,a population unhappy with the ruling authorities,people angling for position and power. Fiennes' motivation for making itwas to get a modern audience to connect with this world, the relevance of its themes to the present,there is the background of Iraq/Afghanistan,the Balkans,the Arab Spring.

The unsympathetic hero is a killing machine,Rome is at war with the Volsces,a neighbouring state led by Martius' sworn enemy,Aufidius(Butler).For securing the town of Corioli,Martius receives the honorary title of `Coriolanus',and to the joy of his mother,the formidable Volumnia(Redgrave),is nominated for the consulship. However the people's tribunes Sicinius and Brutus abhor his arrogance,he denounces them and is banished as a traitor. Coriolanus,has a besieged integrity,with a chilly contempt for the unwashed,fickle,masses and his need for their support to become a consul,he tongue-lashes both opponents and his own troops. He refuses to hear his praises extolled before the senate or show the people his wounds. His wife Virgilia(Chastain)is like a silent dove amongst the eagles and hawks.

We get a grimy,modern cityscape ridden with graffiti,rubble and the grey pall of deprivation. Barry Ackroyd,who worked with Greengrass and in Hurt Locker,establishes a panicky,documentary atmosphere with hand-held cameras, caught up in demonstrations or tense combat. Media-saturated rolling news,video-messaging and hostage-killing staged for the camera,some verse-speaking by newscaster Jon Snow. An element of racial conflict is brought out by the Scots vs. English confrontation between Martius and Aufidius. A homoerotic tone comes in the sweatyembrace of combat or death. Brian Cox is brilliant as a kindly senator friend of Martius,advocating his virtues. Fiennes brings out Coriolanus's rigid scale of values about a man who both wants recognition and doesn't want it at the same time,he is finally broken by the person who made him-his mother.

The film has lots of energy at boiling point,with images of a scarlet faced Coriolanus,steaming with fury,""his eye red as would burn Rome"",""Like an eagle in a dovecote,I/Fluttered your Volscians in Corioli"".The film ends on the word ""Boy"",showing him living like a helpless,childlike,truthful,unfortunate lion,a hypnotized schoolboy.

Fiennes has done Shakespeare a service by filming a lesser dramatized play and succeeding by making it accessible and pertinent,helped in this by a superb cast and a timely setting.",1339113600,3,3302,6.036247334754798
4627567,3,B0059XTUR2,"I had a hard time adjusting to this being a Shakespeare movie basically.  It was the play Coriolanus turned into a war movie that just sort of dropped out and became a hyped up modern version of the play by the end.  The beginning is pretty intense and perhaps that was part of the adjustment period that went wrong.  By the middle other things were fighting for my attention and by the end I felt like I was subjected to an overly long scene of Coriolanus's mother pleading with him.  And the setting just did very little to help me get into the whole Shakespeare mood.

All that said, the acting was superb.  I was totally convinced by the wonderful cast that they were the characters. Fiennes does a good job of creating the title character, as does Vanessa Redgrave as his mother.  She was probably the strongest of all in her portrayal with both grace and attitude.  Very well done for what it is, but I just could not fully get into Coriolanus due to the whole Shakesperean-ness of it.  It's a bit like Shakespeare on steroids at the start and then settles on a more even keel by the end which makes the whole production seem a little unbalanced.

4627569,4,B0059XTUR2,"Modernizing William Shakespeare is difficult, as demonstrated by Ethan Hawke's ineffective ""Hamlet"" in 2000.  By selecting one of the Bard's lesser-known works, Ralph Fiennes won't likely be criticized for using modern warfare and technology alongside the original dialogue.  I don't think anyone will say that this is not the ""Coriolanus"" they remember because I'll bet that 90% of the audience will have never heard of this particular play before seeing this film.  On the downside, there's a definite reason why this is one of Shakespeare's lesser-known works, and no amount of talent, powerful directing, or excellent cinematography can change that.

I was an English major in college and took two semesters of Shakespeare, yet we never read nor discussed ""Coriolanus.""  Traditionally, it is considered a distant or ""opaque"" piece because the characters very rarely use introspection to convey to the audiences their inner thoughts and motivations.  And it's true that not once in this film adaptation do any of the characters speak their minds to the audience.  This makes it very difficult to appreciate any of the characters and their struggles.  True, with the fine actors involved, you get the impression that there's a lot of emotion working beneath the surface, but it makes it harder for a modern audience to make sense of the action and the dialogue in this fully realized, brutally violent setting.  In the extremely brief 5-minute bonus documentary, Fiennes calls his Coriolanus a tragic hero.  From my viewing, having never read the play, I did not get that impression.  Instead he came across as a violent, bitter, despicable, and incredibly selfish man who, while not really caring much for his wife and young son, has some serious mother issues.  Corionlanus is no Hamlet or Lear, and even when he reaches the bottom of his tragic fall, I could not care for him in the slightest.

As an modern war film, ""Coriolanus"" is not bad.  It's not as epic as one might expect, but it does boast several powerful performances and has some intriguing parental and homoerotic undertones.  As a modern adaptation of Shakespeare, we get everything we might expect -- action and dialogue conveyed through television news broadcasts, Skype, and smartphones.  Yet coming some 16 years after Baz Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet,"" these modern trappings and clever storytelling devices seem a bit stale and cliched.  Yet even Shakespeare at his worst is still better than most writers at their very best.  Overall, I have to admit that I enjoyed this, despite the flaws and complaints mentioned here.  I'll likely watch this DVD again in a few years, though this might be worth a rental prior to a purchase for most people, unless you're one of those rare Shakespeare completists who wants to collect everything.",1338940800,,2807,5.076252723311547
4627570,4,B0059XTUR2,"For those that found themselves curiously watching a sea of modern Shakespearean films released throughout the 90's, here is another.  This film not only shows the universal nature of politics, social strives, and humanity in general - this film shows the brilliance of ole Bill Shakespeare himself.  The dialog is very literal to the text and could be difficult to follow for some.  But those that follow closely to the acting and characters, the script seems more grounded and less poetic than a Macbeth or Hamlet.  The story's action tells so much that the text becomes easily dissected.  To me this is neither a plus or minus since Shakespeare's choice of wording is deliberately melodic and a joy to hear or read in any context.

It's hard to describe the story without inferring subtext.  But the point is that this film is for those that enjoy modern translations of Shakespeare - this is full of great actors, beautiful cinematic scenes, and well thought out adapting.  The cast gives a great deal of weight to the words that would seem antiquated to the uninitiated.  There are many modern translations of Shakespeare, but only a select few are able to use the original text without updating it.  Here all is updated, except the text - which to me is an enjoyable way to see ancient Rome in the subtext of modern times, and with the perfected language of Elizabethan era England.  It seems strange, but somehow it works.

For those that enjoy this, try also Ian McKellan's Richard III.  It is often overlooked and is a World War II-esque spin on the classic.",1338854400,,1567,4.7380073800738005
4627591,2,B0059XTUR2,"Right out of the shoot, I need to say that I read everything I can get my hands on ...and I'm also a movie-buff. I'm not an addict, mind you, but I have been known to read plastic table mats in restaurants and go to midnight showings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show (squirt gun and umbrella in-hand). Don't judge me!

Okay. Now that I've got that off my chest, let's talk about why you're reading this: to find out what the heck this movie was all about.

Never heard of it, you say? Not surprising, says I. It didn't get a wide release upon it's opening for unknown reasons (perhaps because, like later Shakespearean plays, it didn't get much notice from fans).

Although I'm both a Ralph Fiennes and Gerard Butler enthusiast, I simply could not get past the 16th century language coming out of their mouths as they fired automatic weapons, blasted each other with RPGs, and screamed at armored military vehicles. It was just too absurd (a sort of period piece taken out of it's period and plunked into our own ...yet keeping the language unchanged).

I will give credit, however, where credit is due. Both Fiennes and Butler played their roles well (frighteningly so in terms of the violence they bestow upon one another and those around them). But that's where my praise must end, I fear. And here's why...

Besides the language being ludicrously out of place in a war-torn world of mythical today, the story itself stuttered. There were repeated scenes where explosions, gun battles and general gratuitous violence raged, and then abruptly stopped so that Shakespearean lines could be delivered. Then we get more violence and ...ooh ...stop. Stop! Gotta get those ""nethers"" and such in there.

If you're going to try and be original (and I'm sure that's what the thoughts were behind the production of this film), I'm fine with that. But don't be original just for the SAKE of BEING original. Make the film flow evenly. Make the language match the action and times.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go read The Tempest!",1338768000,9,2027,4.676966292134831

4627598,4,B0059XTUR2,"Good ambiance. A nice low key Shakespearian tongued melodrama with Coriolanas defender of Rome, slave to his mother's whims crashes head on with his destiny.

The opening fire fight, gun battle/fight is one of the best I have ever seen. Riveting stuff. It is  a modern day Agincourt from Henry V, Branagh and all.

Getting the drift of the lightly framed language in semi-Shakespearian is a most welcomed touch.

When I saw Coriolanas at the cinema on Friday morning to get the cheap admission price there were as many in the audience as when I saw Avenger's 3D on Friday morning. Shakespeare can go mainstream, famously at that.

Recommend this movie for any collection. The Blu-Ray package is the best bargain. For $3.00 bucks more you get a Blu-Ray DVD and a regular DVD.

The dumb studios need to enhance the sound for older people and those who user computers to view DVD motion pictures. At the present the sound is pathetically weak even on plasma and LED TVs. There is no excuse for this oversight. Bill Gates stinks. They should film these movies with higher than normal sound. One can always turn down the volume. Turning up the volume presently does little to make the sound louder. Have to depend on closed captioning.

Again, Bill Gates stinks. Let him pay some news agency to make him out to be a god while in the real world he sucks big time.",1338508800,,1357,4.605809128630705
4627599,5,B0059XTUR2,"Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List, English Patient, all the Harry Potter movies) directs and plays the part of Caius Marcius Coriolanus in ""Coriolanus"", a tragedy written by William Shakespeare.  Being that it is a 500 year old play, the words and expressions might be hard to understand on the surface.  But if you can immerse yourself into the action of the story, the words and form make sense.

I was again struck at just how good of an actor Mr. Fiennes is.  The rest of the cast is solid as well.  Vanessa Redgrave is Volumnia, Caius' mother.  Gerard Butler (300, Reign of Fire, TimeLine) plays Tullus Aufidius, Caius' enemy and ally.  Brian Cox (Rob Roy, Braveheart, Bourne movies) plays Menenius, Caius' friend and supporter.

This is not a well known play of Shakespeare.  My schooling included Shakespeare in high school and college, but I did not know of this play.  It is one of the Bard of Avon's better plays methinks.

There are a number of good or great soliloquies in Coriolanus, but I think one sums up the entire play in a few minutes.  Right after Caius is banished from Rome, after all of the battles he fought in the defense of Rome, he quite angrily says, "" You common cry of curs!  Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air.  I...banish...you!  And here remain with your uncertainty.  Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts.  Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair.  Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows.  Despising, for you, the city....thus.... I turn my back.  There is a world....elsewhere.""

I was captivated by the play.  Bringing William Shakespeare's work to today's place was very nicely done.  I enjoyed it immensely.  I hope you do too.",1338508800,3,1991,4.7043478260869565
4627600,5,B0059XTUR2,"I believe this film is ment to bring/adapt Shakespeare to a new generation. Does today's society understand the lifestyle that existed in the times in which are portrayed in the play? No. This portrayal is as real as it gets for modern combat, and demonstrates how the relationships from the play would be interpreted in today's society. The acting is outstanding and even with the gap in language, the story is compelling. This film will not be hailed by the masses because people don't want to have to interpret a story, they want it adapted to make it easier for them. I loved the movie and enjoyed the challenge of following the dialog, as I am by no means versed in its tone.",1338508800,5,680,4.536585365853658
4627621,5,B0059XTUR2,"This movie wasn't aggressively marketed, nor did it play in many theaters.  I suspect the Weinstein Co.  didn't expect much of an audience for a movie based on Shakespeare.  It is a shame since the acting, directing, cinematography, and even the sound of the battle scenes, were superb.  For a long time, Sir Ian McKellan's Richard III has been the gold standard of putting the Bard in a modern setting, but Coriolanus surpasses it.

Not only does it remain true to Shakespeare, but it is a great war movie and character study.  The casting is perfect.  I cannot think how it would be possible to improve on it.  Even the minor characters added much to the overall quality of this movie.  The blu ray disc is has no video flaws and the sound is extraordinarily good and has great dynamic range.  In fact, if you live in an apartment and your sound system has the option of limiting the dynamic range, you might want to use it.  That way, you can hear the dialogue, but won't get complaints from your neighbors during the battle scenes.",1338422400,2,1035,4.54054054054054
4627622,4,B0059XTUR2,"Adapting Shakespeare isn't as easy as it looks.  Some adaptations take a more mainstream route, creating strong films that many don't even know are based on Shakespeare (THE LION KING, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, O).  Others go the more artsy path, thus alienating a larger audience while keeping their auteur integrity intact (THE TEMPEST, TITUS, basically anything by Kenneth Branagh).  CORIOLANUS, despite what the trailers and tense action scenes would suggest, is firmly in the latter category, with Shakespearean dialogue/characters set against an alternate universe where the Roman general wields a machine gun instead of a sword (though he does have one big-a** knife).

Ralph Fiennes, who also directed, plays the titular warlord, a general-turned-politician-turned exile who reunites with his harshest enemy (Gerard Butler) in order to regain his honor.  The plot is the basic tragic-antihero storyline that makes Shakespeare's tragedies and histories so engrossing; John Logan's screenplay puts a nice twist on things, while staying true to the source.  Fiennes gives a solid performance, and Butler is almost as good (nice to hear him not hiding behind an accent anymore).  Vanessa Redgrave, as the leader's forceful mother, steals most of her scenes, as does Brian Cox as Coriolanus's political ally.  Jessica Chastain doesn't get much to do here (let's face it, a Shakespearean world is largely a man's world, as any lit professor would gladly express to you at great length), but she does it well.

Fiennes's directing is solid: the action near the beginning is engaging (the fight scene between Fiennes and Butler is nail-bitingly tense), and the more dramatic scenes (which constitute much of the film; don't let those action-fueled trailers fool you) are handled without too much melodrama.  Ultimately, CORIOLANUS comes off as another effective Shakespearean adaptation.  It's not the best, and it's not the most creative, but it has some fine performances...and is, of course, a powerful story or a flawed individual.  But you probably already knew that.",1338336000,2,2074,5.3476923076923075
4627623,5,B0059XTUR2,"It is not often that I watch a movie and spend the next day grabbing people by their shirts and shouting ""YOU GOTTA SEE THIS MOVIE!""

What an action movie!  Gun fights, knife fights, explosions, tanks rolling through ruined urban landscapes!  With Elizabethan dialog.  While it is set in ""Rome"", the backdrop is suspiciously like Former Yugoslavia.

The story is straight from the Shakespeare play of the same name.  Caius Marcius is a terse warfighter of the noble (Patrician) class of Rome. While the plebeians are whining for more restraints on the upper classes and more privileges, Caius leads the forces of Rome against a problematic neighbor and returns victorious, earning the name Coriolanus, after the city where he defeated the Volsces. The military success is parleyed into political success until the unwashed, uneducated, and generally tacky plebeians arrange his ousting. At which point, Caius Marcius turns on them.

The story has too many layers to sum up, and cannot be described further without serious spoilers.  But many forms of loyalty, respect for enemies, honor, integrity, subversion, several forms of treason, political maneuvering, and relations between an over-entitled population and the military are all themes in Coriolanus.

It works brilliantly.  Like a stage production of ""Merchant of Venice"" set in Le Vieux Carre, New Orleans, the urban combat and modern halls of power fit the story well.  One reviewer remarked that it looked like Ireland during The Troubles, but even in the trailers that didn't feel quite right.  To my eye, it looked more like the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.  I was not surprised to see various Serbian government agencies and cities in the credits.  I'm sure the Roman officers and troops wearing U.S. camouflage uniforms was noticed, and a source of amusement for the Serbs involved in making this movie.

In short:
YOU GOTTA SEE THIS MOVIE!

4627626,4,B0059XTUR2,"Ralph Fiennes displays his Shakespearean chops in this well done modern adaptation of the classic play by the same name.  Fiennes' performance is powerful and compelling as Caius Martius Coriolanus.  He brings life to Middle English with a degree of mastery that few can muster in the modern age.

The supporting acting is similarly noteworthy, with a top-notch performance from Brian Cox as Menenius, and solid support from Vanessa Redgrave as Martius' mother.  Gerard Butler was overshadowed in his role as Tullus Aufidius, but showed himself reasonably proficient in Shakespearean drama.

The Roman tragedy is set in the modern age, as the Romans and Volscians do battle with M-4s, AK-47s and laser sights instead of swords and shields.  The TV news coverage and talking heads keep up the Shakespearean dialogue, although admittedly there is a sense of disconnect with geographic references like Antium and the ""Volscian border"".

Generally speaking, this production is gripping and true to the original narrative and dialogue.  It's a worthy and laudable endeavor, and I would commend it with confidence to any afficionado of the Bard.",1338249600,,1139,5.288888888888889
4627627,3,B0059XTUR2,"Ralph Fiennes directed a movie, set in contemporary world based on Shakespeare's play ""Coriolanus"".  It goes without saying that Shakespeare' work transcendes time and it is universal to every era.  This play is no different.  Coriolanus is a Roman warrior who dedicates his life and career to defending Rome from foreign invaders.  He has it all: a beautiful wife and son, mother who is patriotic, loyal to the family (and controlling to say the least). Marcus Coriolanus has potential to become a powerful politician.  But his patriotism is matched by his sense of entitlement of his class status for greater things, which in turn creates resentment from his political enemies.  His enemies turn ordinary people against Corealanus and before long, Marcus' career comes to a screeching holt and Marcus Coriolanus finds himself in exile.  Nations and people who were his enemies yesterday become his allies tomorrow and Marcus sets on a mission to get his revenge.

There are some big name actors in this movie and really fine performances by them all.  But contemporary setting (in war ravaged eastern Europe) seems to poor match for fine english language of the screenplay.  The entire film is made in Serbia (Belgrade and Pozarevac) and some scenes were shot in Montenegro.  Camera seems to be a little bit shakey at times and sound of the film is uneven.  I would say that film like this one is aquired taste.  If one is in a mood for a play that can be watched at home instead of being seen in a theatre, this is a perfect movie.  But for audience unaccustomed to Shakesperian language, film may appear to be a drag.  I personally liked it.  However, I feel that this sort of genre is not meant for wide audiences.",1338249600,37,1719,4.776271186440678
4627628,5,B0059XTUR2,"I admit that a modern version of a lesser known Shakespeare play did not sound like a great idea to me.  (To be honest, my first thought was of the film _Trekkies_ where William Shatner is trying produce a rap version of ""Julius Caesar.""  He performs it at the end of the show, and it is actually pretty good, but I digress ...)

I could not have been more wrong.  This film was absolutely amazing!  After watching Fiennes as Voldemort in Harry Potter, I grimaced when he came into the first shot.  But, when Fiennes spoke, he had an incredible presence.  His cadence, body language, diction, and all of the intangibles that go into acting were ""spot on"" for his role.

The fourteen year old I watched it with was also absolutely rapt.  (That is worth five stars no matter what!)

Fiennes stars as one of two principal point of view characters as General Caius Martius.  Martius is a hard nosed, professional soldier with little regard for pacifying or playing to the masses.

His counterpoint is revolutionary Aufidius played by Gerard Butler.  Whereas Fiennes rightly plays Martius by ""chewing on the scenery,"" Gerard Butler does a fantastic job by playing a very understated Aufidius.

The film is an extremely close match to the play, and we see Martius rise, fall, rise again, only to be betrayed and murdered in the end.

Roll the credits!

This film is brilliant, and most watchers will be pleasantly surprised.

I highly recommend it.

views to it's people the politicians as well as his mother decide to
banish him from the city. Angry and seeking revenge he decides to join
the army of his sworn Tullus Aufidius (Butler) in hopes of exacting his
revenge. I will start by saying that yes I knew this was a Shakespeare
play going in. I also should tell you that I am not, nor really have
ever been a fan of his. The preview I saw made me really want to see
this though and I was excited. The movie itself was very good and
interesting with a pretty timely (hundreds of years later) idea. All
that said I had a hard time getting into it because while it was set in
present day it still had the ""Shakespeare speak"" and not being a big
fan it was a little hard to understand in some parts. I did follow it
enough to understand what was going on, but a few of the one-on-one
emotional scenes really lost it's effect on me because I was trying to
translate it in my mind and missed some of it. If you are a fan of this
then you will probably love this. I, not being a fan, liked it but I
think if it was spoken in ""normal English"" I would have liked it more.

the action is superb, the acting is great, but I can't seem to get over this Shakespearean dialogue!!  True to form,
the actors speak in poetic lines to each other, creating stiff and impersonal dialogue.  Even as bombs are exploding
and bullets are flying everywhere, the characters under siege seemingly have time to think their lines so to express
their sentiments in poetic rhythm.  Viewers really have to be hard-core Shakespeare fans to feel this poetic dialogue of
late 1500s England adds something to the film.  This would have been a much better overall dramatic production if standard
English would have been used, even if it would not have been true to the original work.  Don Quijote de la Mancha was written
by Cervantes in Spanish, yet we all enjoy it in English.  This type of consideration should have been made for the film production
of this classic work, Coriolanus. On the other hand, by setting the TV volume at zero, viewers bothered by the unconvincing dialogue
can pretend it is a silent film and still enjoy all the action (oh, yes, switch off the subtitles as they appear stiff too).",1337990400,9,1220,4.726415094339623
