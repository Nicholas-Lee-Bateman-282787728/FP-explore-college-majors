534833,5,6303011063,"Dona Flora is based on the novel by Jorge Amado and directed by Bruno Baretto.  The 1978 film, stars Sonia Braga, well known in the United States.  Set in the 40s in a small town in Brazil is the main character, a beautiful sensual woman named Dona Flora who teaches cooking classes.  The young woman is married to  Vlahinho who is notorious as the real villain you love to hate.  He is a swindler, a drunk, a pervert, a liar, a gambler, a wife beater and, according to Dona Flora, a great sex partner.

The movie opens with a colorful and musical town carnival where Vlahindo frolicks with his raunchy displays and drops dead.  Missing him, Dona Flora imagines how wonderful her lovemaking was.  We are then taken back into the world of Vlahindo, his scheming charming ways, with the ability to con the Father of the church.  We see how blatent his flirtatious escapades such as grabbing the rear ends of women while they listen to his wife in her cooking demonstrations.  We also learn about his addiction to gambling, and beating Dona Flor for money.  But, she loooovvves him!

Dona Flora remarries the pharmacist, someone a complete departure for Vlahindo.  Teodoro is well-mannered, reputable, plain and somewhat older.  But as time goes by, in a ghostly fashion, Vlahindo show up frequently, always in the nude and Dona Flora succumbs to his playboy sexual antics.

This is an entertaining film, and similar to many Latin foreign film, there is lots of nudity and sex scenes that are more restrained with nudity more frequent.  There is fun and music and an array of characters that add to the fun.

Similar to this that I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Vida-Conyugal-Married-Life/dp/B00008H2HV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Vida Conyugal (Married Life)</a>, is another Latin film, where a women has sex with other men in hopes that she can urge one of them to kill her husband.

534834,5,6303011063,"I first rented this movie in the 1980s from Blockbuster. It was so different, such a surprising delight, I watched it again about 10 years later. Different from anything I saw before or since.

I would like to see this on DVD, then I would purchase a copy. I discovered Sonia Braga in this movie. She was demure, then glowing with repressed eroticism, very sexy and then naked with her two husbands. Definitely not for those who cannot deal with open expressions of multidimensions of the sensual - music, samba, touch, dance, food, color, pastels, alleys, crooked walls etcetera.

Someone said it is amateurish etcetera. Definitely not 21st century production values, but it is a work of art.",1136937600,15,693,4.864406779661017
534835,5,6303011063,"I really enjoyed this movie. At first I thought that her two husbands were Vadinho the gambler and drunk, and Vadinho the loving husband.  He was bascially two different people himself.  I would have left him if I was her, though but I understand that in that time women didn't leave their husbands.  Also in that time, it was not uncommon for men to have mistresses.  After Vadinho's death, I was happy that Doa Flor decided to remarry, but I thought that she could've found someone more interesting than Teodoro. He's a nice guy and all, but he's just so boring.  She was used to the wildlife with Vadinho, and it was a shock to her when she married Teodoro.  I think that's why she gave into Vadinho when his soul returned.  And since she was the only one who could see him, there was no harm in having realtions with him once again, and in the future. She was happy with both of them. She was getting the best of both worlds.  I highly recommend this movie to all movie goers.",1038182400,10,980,4.346153846153846
534836,3,6303011063,"I'm only writing this review because a lot of people seem to think this is such a great movie.  I wish now that I had bought the Sally Fields version.  This is very amatuerishly done in my opinion.  It was made nearly 30 years ago, and if you want to watch an out-of-shape soap opera star run out naked, maybe you will like it.  He wasn't comical, he was just repulsive.  Had he been gorgeous, maybe I would have liked it better.  Save your money and buy the American version.",1000598400,2,476,4.233333333333333

534887,5,6303011063,"Finally, after several years of searching, I found a dvd of this film at less than $150!

This is a terrific comedy about a woman whose first husband was fun, passionate & sexy, but a drunk, liar, cheat, con man, gambler, abusive and completely unreliable.  He dies during carnival.  As one of the characters says about him, there wasn't a single cause of death, rather his liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, in fact all of his body, gave out as a result of years of alcohol & partying 24/7.  After an appropriate mourning period, a pharmacist begins courting the young widow.  He is everything that her departed husband wasn't.  He is older, sober, honest, well-to-do, very reliable... and passionless, un-sexy and a general stick-in-the-mud.  Dona Flor marries him because he is a respectable, nice man who professes to love her.  But her new marriage is extremely dull and she begins to recall her late husband and how passionate he was.  In fact she recalls him so strongly that he reappears, but only to her.  She is torn between her love and respect for her second husband and her passion for her first.  Eventually she decides that she can have both.

This is a great film based on a great novel by Jorge Amado.  The film immerses the viewer in mid-20th Century Brazilian culture as well as the storyline.  In fact, much of the story line is about the cultural image that the Brazilian male has of himself.  The myth of the American male is personified by John Wayne and the myth of the Brazilian male is personified by the ""malandro"" Vadinho, the first husband.  Now, you have learned a Portuguese word. ""malandro"".  See the film and you will truly understand it.  The same production/direction team and many of the same cast members also made ""Gabriela"" which is likewise based on a terrific novel by Amado.  The first time I saw ""Dona Flor"" 25 years ago, I couldn't understand or speak Portuguese.  If you don't understand Portuguese, don't let that dissuade you;, even with the sub-titles, it is great fun.  And buy a translation of the novels.  You will thank me for turning you on to one of the most wonderful Latin American novelists of the 20th Century.  I am a big fan of the Latin American Spanish language ""Boom"" authors, but Amado is particularly special, in both Portuguese and translation.",1331596800,,2305,4.7218045112781954

534889,5,6303011063,"I first saw this film in a theater in the 1970s, and have loved it ever since.  It's the story of a woman whose first husband is a charming wastrel, gambler, womanizer, but good in bed, and whose second husband is steady, kind, and boring in bed.  The woman, played by the beautiful Sonja Braga, winds up happy in this very charming film from Brazil.",1323043200,,350,4.369230769230769
534890,5,6303011063,"I always thought Nora Epron stole the idea of incorporating recipes into the story's narrative for her novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heartburn/dp/0679767959/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heartburn</a>&nbsp;from Jorge Amado's sly 1977 book about a virtuous but sensual Bahia cooking school teacher hopelessly besotted with her philandering, gambling husband. Here it is beautifully  translated to screen with our heroine, Dona Flor, portrayed by the beautiful Sonia Braga and set in Brazil in 1943 complete with period costumes, beautiful food and period music.

The story lesiurely unfolds as the viewer comes to understand why it is Dona Flor loves her sexy Vadinho and puts up with his abuse.  After he drops dead during a Carnival samba dressed in drag and wearing a large fake male organ, Dona Flor is inconsolable.  Celibate and desperately missing sex, she finally remarries.  This time her choice (to her mother's delight) is a solid middle-class pharmacist, a good man, loving husband and bassoon player. However, on her honeymoon, Dona Flor discovers to her dismay that something is missing in the bedroom.  Act 3 of our story takes a mystical bent with the undead Vadinho suddenly appearing naked in her bedroom and only Flor can see him.  Death has not changed Vadinho, he still goes around to his old haunts, helps out his gambling friends and favorite prostitutes, all the while trying to make it with his wife who still retains her sexual longings.

The movie diverges from the book at the ending and although both work for Dona Flor whom we come to love, I prefer the book ending which resolves the dilemma by demonstrating Flor's emotional growth and good character.  However, find the movie if you can and/or read the book, it is a funny tale with great recipes.  Now if I only had a plate of those crabs with dente oil and onions.",1243296000,4,1896,5.248344370860927
534891,4,6303011063,"This is one of my all time favorite foreign films from Brazil. Brazil is much more liberal than the USA. I know it cut out some of the more raunchy parts, yet still has some. Children under 18 should not be allowed to see this film unless parents watch it first and decide how liberal they want to be. Knowledge of Portuguese and Spanish is almost a must because the subtitles just give you a gist of what is said. But since I speak Spanish and some Portuguese I understand it well.",1238112000,3,482,4.25

7834480,4,6303011063,"Saw this when it came out back in the early 80's ---It has stood the test of time for me and I enjoyed not only seeing it again but owning it finally as well.  Obviously a foreign film (Brazilian to be exact). ---  If you've never seen it, it would depend on your taste as to whether you will like it. --- I ABSOLUTELY HATE SPOILERS so you'll have to read someone else's review if you want to know all the little details of the film. --- I will say it's a Brazillian film & their perspective on life is very different than that of an American or European...... It centers around a woman whose husband is a major cad who even though newly married lives as if he's single as could be.  He's kind of that loveable(subjective) rogue/scoundrel if you will AND that the plot is VERY unusual & Bizarre.  That said IMO it flows together well & I don't find it to be disjointed.  --- It's well written & acted & is a super rare gem for those of us who like and/ or appreciate this kind of offbeat Foreign offering. If your reading this now It has to be assumed that you have already seen the movie or it has been recommended to you. Although if your a feminist somebody is playing a joke on you.  While there's  great comedy on display there's also that serious latin machismo in play & pumping strong. ---- On to the disc quality.... I will shed some light on that subject for you.  The dvd has not been restored or remastered & the colors & general quality is washed out etc.  That said while I love a Criterion Blu-ray release of practically anything It is always more important to have the film on disc than not ( I reference ""The Grey Fox"" on that issue-- 30years later & still no R1 U.S.A. dvd release let alone a Blu-ray or 4k Blu-ray).  So yeah not everyone can afford or wants to spend the required $ to own/see this ultra rare offbeat flick but I LOVE having it in my extensive collection & like being able to view it whenever the mood strikes. Hope this info helps you out",1400198400,,1974,4.226063829787234
