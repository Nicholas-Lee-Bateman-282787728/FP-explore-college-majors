The DVD covers all type of riding from fast XC, freeride, urban, dirt jumping, downhill, northshore and then onto what I will describe as just insane-stupidity as some of the riders hit massive drops and ride off cliffs.  The Tour de France gap jump is sensationally brilliant, even more so if you're a bit of a roadie too.

The urban street riding is extremely impressive and the best bit is that this time you get to see some 'bloopers' as the riders re-attempt what they crashed on earlier.  Lots of helmet cam sequences along with fully staged set-up jumps.  The northshore helmet cam sequences give you the best idea of how insane these guys are, especially when you follow them right off 30ft drops into the forest.

I got this DVD from a friend, to watch while I was recovering from my own sensational freeride stack, and all it did was feul my desire to get out riding again.  If its raining outside and you decide to watch this DVD to pass the time - forget it, you'll soon be riding in the rain.  I recommend getting a few mates together one evening, a carton of beer and pizza and just have a great laugh and be gob-smacked!  You only need to buy one MTB DVD and this is it... (of course, ""Earthed 2"" makes a great compliment to it!)",1138579200,2,1485,4.3478260869565215
