8536600,5,B0096DHY2O,"As a Zen student and practitioner living in rural Missouri i have difficulty getting to the nearest Zen center on a regular basis. I ordered this dvd in hopes that i would feel how it must be being a part of a Sanga. I must say that it was truly inspiring and touching to see this living community of practitioners living,working and sitting together in such beautiful harmony. It is my dream to be able to go there myself and feel that first hand. Thank you for allowing others in to your sanga to see such beautiful display of what Zen is all about. I recommend this film to anyone interested in Zen.",1353715200,,602,4.336283185840708
