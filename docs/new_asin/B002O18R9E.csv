8375795,3,B002O18R9E,Good Italian-made horror film.  I reviewed this film under the title Crypt of the Vampire.  This DVD release is not as good as the Retromedia version.  The picture quality is not as clear.  The Morella opening and closing segments are silly.  Sort of a poor man's Elvira.  Steer clear of this and get the Retromedia version.,1395446400,2,324,4.696428571428571
