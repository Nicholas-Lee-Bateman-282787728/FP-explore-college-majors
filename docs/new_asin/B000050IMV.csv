1385568,1,B000050IMV,"Can a movie possibly be worse than this one? No. This movie stunk eight ways from Sunday. The acting was horrible. The filming was horrible. The plot was horrible. The script was horrible. The whole premise was horrible.
The best part of the whole movie was getting to see the various [characters] get killed off.
When I die, if I find I wasn't as good as I needed to be, I'll be spending eternity watching this movie.",984268800,,418,4.441558441558442
1385569,4,B000050IMV,"This movie wasn't advertised at all, but when I found it, I thought it looked interesting.  I''ve always been interested in cheesy horror flicks, especially when there isn't a high budget.  This was a strong cast, with strong performances and good looks which always helps.  Plus, I really enjoyed the special features.  I hope to see more of these young stars, Shannon and Z were my favorites.",976665600,5,394,4.835820895522388
1385570,4,B000050IMV,I expected this movie to be less scary. But it was quite scary. This wasn't an indipendantly made film and wasn't very good quality but it was enjoyable,972777600,3,152,4.464285714285714
1385588,1,B000050IMV,"Great American literary giant, Washington Irving is rolling over in his grave because of this celluloid (actually video) travesty. Summerfield & Arth take numerous liberties with the Irving template setting the story in modern times, and moving the location from the dreadfully modern Sleepy Hollow High School to some dreadful prefabricated Maryland Suburb.",1110067200,4,358,5.773584905660377
1385589,1,B000050IMV,If I could I would give this movie negative stars. The costumes: They look like they were made by a middle school drama class. The angles of which it was shot at are horrible and you can never tell what is going on as the screen is practically black all the time. I swear this movie was made with a webcam. I would rather hang myself with my own intestines than watch this again.,1095033600,5,379,4.135135135135135
1385590,5,B000050IMV,"This was the freaking funniest cheap horror film I have EVER seen, I HIGHLY recommend it, you will laugh your fanny-pack off in the forest and be brutally attacked by the head..+removingglasses+..less horseman of hilarity. The movie itself was a masterpiece of pureeee genius. Do yourself a favor and get this movie. Not to mention the extras, with Terrance J. Anth as the historian. (We've known him a while, Shannon's character was purely inspired by my friend.) Not that we are biased because of that. It's just so awesome, anyone who doesn't love this movie for whatever reason needs to be tied up in the forest with a pillow case over their head and have snitch written across their chest in hot chocolate while getting their nipples caked by Bobbi.",1072915200,,754,4.8076923076923075
1385591,1,B000050IMV,"What's the movie about?  A headless horseman killing kids from Sleepy Hollow High!  Why is he, she or it doing this?  I don't know.  Terrible acting combined with a script right out of the trash can equals the worst movie I have ever seen in my 37 years of life!  I cannot believe that people got paid for making and acting in this.  I have seen home movies of peoples vacations that have had more of a plotline that Sleepy Horror High.  The lighting had to have been done with a flashlight and to help improve the lightning situation, a campfire was started toward the end of this fine feature film so the actors could see in the dark.  I give it one star not only because I can't go lower, but because of what I saw in the credits at the end (yes, I suffered through it all!)  The filmmakers thanked ""Visa and Mastercard who without their support, the film would have never been made"" (I'm not kidding about this, look for yourself!) That sentence alone made me laugh as hard as any comedy has made me laugh. This should be shown in college film classes as the how to not make a movie!",1056585600,,1087,4.263414634146342
1385592,1,B000050IMV,"If you've read any of my other reviews, you know I love low budget horror.  Unfortunately, this train wreck of a movie is so bad that it isn't even funny.  The camera shots are often so dark that you can't tell what is going on.  There is one decent killing where big streams of blood squirts from a body like a Monty Python movie, but otherwise there is nothing here to even keep your attention.  Negligible gore, no nudity, horrible acting, awful camera work, no originality......  I could go on.  I honestly can say that I haven't fast forwarded through very many movies, but after 45 minutes of this stuff I did and you will too!  Stay away from this steamer!",1045958400,2,663,4.429752066115703
1385593,1,B000050IMV,"This movie was really BAD! ""Bad"" is the only adjective to describe it. WHO THE HELL WAS THE CASTING DIRECTOR? I""VE made better films than this piece of crud! STAY AWAY! The cast...BAD
The story... BAD  The Direction... umm was there any direction? ...or was it just anyone the cast found that could hold a camcorder and press RECORD. As I watched the movie I thought that it might make up for it's horrible plot by having some cool death scenes and gore. NOTHING! This movie had like.. NO BLOOD! The only Slasher movie that I have ever seen that had no gore and still scared the hell out of you.. was John Carpenter's Halloween! This movie was silly, chessy, and BAD!",1029542400,3,667,4.467213114754099
1385594,1,B000050IMV,"This is a pretty stinky (...), even if you're someone like me who generally appreciates homegrown horror films on zero budgets. The concept of a Headless Horsemen masked slasher stalking kids at Sleepy Hollow High had promise and certainly interested me enough to purchase the DVD. Sadly, this film seems to wallow in its ineptitude. Since I could tell the crew only had one good light to use, I was terrified that the plot was leading up to night scenes for the climax. My fears came to life as everything became too dark to see and actors spent whole scenes standing in the only available light without being able to move. The documentary and commentary didn't do much to improve my respect for the director, who spends most of the documentary wearing a woman's dress and acting silly. He seems to be trying to imitate either Trey Parker or Ed Wood (or both), but manages to make both look like incredible artists by comparison. Beware!",1005091200,8,938,4.6909090909090905
1385595,1,B000050IMV,"""This was a strong cast, with strong performances and good looks which always helps.""
Were we both watching the same movie?
Because the Sleepy Hollow High that I watched did not have a strong cast, strong prformances, nor good looks.
For starters, the movie made no sense.  It was put together sloppily and the way it ended made you not only think you had wasted the time watching it but left you of course wondering what the filmakers were trying to accomplish with the story they started at the end. The acting was terrible.  The sets were terrible.  The lighting was terrible.  The dialog was terrible.
There were a number of strange plotlines developed that never went anywhere.  The boy being harrassed at the beginning.  The mask in his car.  The teacher (c'mon...his name was Mr. E.  Get it...Mr. E...mister e, mystery).  The counselor/principal/whatever at the end.  It made no sense.
I spent seven dollars on the video version of this.  I could have just as easily burned that seven dollars.  I think that would have been easier to watch.
If I never see this movie again, it will be too soon.",993427200,,1101,4.677083333333333
1385596,5,B000050IMV,My kids enjoyed this horror movie very much.  I enjoyed it for the fact that it was something they could watch.  Which is rare.,989452800,2,127,4.25
1385597,1,B000050IMV,"""Sleepy Hollow High"" is, without a doubt, the worst horror film ever made.  The acting is atrocious.  The story is laughably bad.  And the budget is equal to the price of a loaf of bread.  Which means I had to have it!
I am a lover of bad films, so I picked it up on VHS as soon as I saw it.  (Of course, I have to keep it outside, so it won't stink up the house.)  Then, when I heard it was coming to DVD, I, immediately, jumped online and ordered it.  (Actually, I think I paid more for the VHS than the DVD.) So, if you love crappy movies like I do, order it.  (Plus, if you order a copy, then the film-makers have already tripled their profit.)  The DVD also contains deleted scenes (snicker) and commentary track by the film-makers (lol), so you can't go wrong with this disc.  I must warn you though.  The running time printed on the box says 90 minutes.  My VCR clocked the running time to be about 76 minutes.
But, the story...ah, yes...a group of kids go into the woods and one by one fall victim to a headless horseman or something.... Hell, I don't know.  I couldn't stop laughing long enough to catch all of the story.",986860800,,1130,4.152073732718894
7928997,5,B000050IMV,This is a good well made movie. If you are a big fan of horror movies or like watching movies where there are people in the hoods I'd recommend buying this. The acting isn't the greatest but it keeps you in entertained... also the storyline was pretty good to.,1441670400,,260,4.326530612244898
7928998,1,B000050IMV,"I'd never heard of this movie until today when I found it (unopened) in a thrift store.  Looking just at the cover art, I knew this had to be cheesy.  For whatever reason, I bought it anyway.  Boy, was I in for a surprise.

'Cheesy' doesn't even begin to cover this.  This, is just plain awful.  Awful!  As others have said, the acting is atrocious,  the budget is almost non-existent, the music forgettable, and I never could decipher a plot.  The only things worse than the main feature were the special features.

Truly, the only decent actor in this whole train wreck was the horse, and he/she was hardly even in it.",1423008000,,620,4.455357142857143

7929000,5,B000050IMV,you know some of these low budget movies are alot better than the high budget movies this one was pretty good i'd see it again. not a bad movie at all.,1281225600,,151,3.903225806451613
7929001,5,B000050IMV,"Look inside yourself, not just below the skin or into your nose or mouth, but deeper still. Travel to the center of your innards, but without opening yourself surgically. Here you will find that light does penetrate deeply into flesh and thus your guts are immersed darkness. If you fear the darkness then you will have to travel back to the exterior of your body or perhaps to shallow layers of your epidermis and hope that it is daytime, and that you are outside in the sunlight and not covered by light-blocking clothing.

If you run from the darkness you will never discover that your pancreas secretes amylase, or that the gall bladder produces bile. Perhaps you are afraid of the dark. Maybe there is something that you fear, like the darkness inside you.

If you want to find out what darkness really means then you will watch this movie, in the dark.",1259971200,,858,4.601307189542483
7929002,1,B000050IMV,"I don't think ""movie"" is even appropriate for this piece of [...]!!!

The entire plot is just ridiculous, crappy.  There's VERY bad acting going on and everyone in it is FUGLY (with the exception of Meagan Lopez, she's hot, but still a BAD actress).

There's this stupid black guy in it, who's fat and black and he's just nasty.

This crap must've been filmed with a webcam, as the image quality is horrible!  I mean, even Paris Hilton's night-vision sex video has better image and sound than this.  The sound is grainy.

Overall, this is just a VERY VERY VERY bad movie.  VERY VERY BAD!!!

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!

But most of all, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!

I'd rate it NEGATIVE if I could... it's that bad.",1169251200,,712,4.52755905511811
7929003,1,B000050IMV,"Low budget horror film has no real horror and its story of a mysterious woodsman offing some really bad actors has been done many times before and better.  Writer/director/producer/co-star Kevin Summerfield obviously collected a few of his friends and attempted to make a cohesive movie.  The result is awful.  Acting is non-existent and once again they decided to have the most obnoxious character try and be a hero.....oops....

Not much here, folks.",1169164800,,452,5.236111111111111
7929004,1,B000050IMV,"I can't believe $17,000.00 was spent on this piece of tripe. Where did the money go? This movie had bad acting, bad lighting, bad sound, bad camera work, bad editing with the same establishing shots shown over and over and over again in nothing more than a lame attempt to get the running time to feature length.

I have seen movies made with less money that are extremely high quality and entertaining.",1156723200,3,403,4.597222222222222
7929005,1,B000050IMV,"Jesus,Joseph, and Mary! I could not believe how truly awful this ""film"" was. Now, I understand you have to start someplace. Grab your Dad's digital camera and bribe your friends and teachers to be

in your movie. We've all done it. Words of advice: Don't ruin a perfect horror legend like Sleepy Hollow. Don't try to copy ""Blair Witch"" or ""Dawson's Creek"". And for the love of God, Do not try to decapitate the blonde using your sister's wig!! And what is with the fat black guy? This was comedy where it was supposed to be terror. I will give one star for the murder weapon: A huge ""Excalibur"" style sword. That was cool. As for the rest of this disaster, the opening scene could not be seen! Literally. The ""acting"" was beyond wooden, and the co-director, Chris Arth, should not have admitted that he ""directed"" at all!",1114560000,4,821,4.547297297297297
7929006,2,B000050IMV,"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow has been told on the screen time and again, and in many different forms, but I must say that this is a first. In the era of ""Dawson's Creek"" and ""Felicity"", independent film makers have taken the truely scary concept of the hesdless horseman and turned it into a 90-minute teen soap, complete with bad acting and choppy plot. To stay well within the boundaries of teen soap-ville, USA, all of the important storyline factors apply: who is sleeping with who? who is pregnant? a teen, commit suicide because he boyfriend dumped her? It's like the film makers are addicted the the ""Creek"", because every plot twist is torn straight from the television series. To make things worse, a little bit of ""Scream"" and a whole lot of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" is thrown in as well. Add in the cheap look of the film, and cheesy soundtrack, and you're in B-movie heaven. 2 stars, and that's being generous.",1112918400,4,930,4.574850299401198
