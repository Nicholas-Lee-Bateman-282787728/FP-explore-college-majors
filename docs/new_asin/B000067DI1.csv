7962788,4,B000067DI1,this was actually a pretty good movie.  Not quite a traditional werewolf movie but acceptable.  Again another addition to my Tim Curry collection.,1354924800,,146,5.304347826086956
7962789,5,B000067DI1,"Blood Moon is such a tragic and fantastic film. The story of Tara growing up in a roaming sideshow owned by Harley Dune showcasing as the wolf girl is one that will burn into your mind. born with a rare disease Tara spends most of her days performing as a misfit of nature and wishing that she could have a normal life. She gets a taste of the everday ho hum when she makes friends with a young man who trys his best to make her fondest wish come true. Harley (who is a father figure to Tara) and the rest of her outcast family start to notice physical and emotional changes in Tara. her animalistic and human sides fight for control of her. I was completely captivated by this movie from start to finish. I must say i was so heart broken in the end, i practically sobbed like a baby. This is a hands down gotta see film.",1293840000,,821,4.1375
7962790,4,B000067DI1,"An exceedingly well-done piece, with fine performances all around.  Tim Curry is allowed to play a three-dimensional character, for a change, and does sterling work.  Victoria Sanchez's multi-faceted Tara emerges as the focal character from a fascinating tapestry of freak show entertainers.  The most freakish characters are the so-called ""normal"" teenage tormentors.  Though the movie's finale tends toward formula, the overall mix of genres, depth of performances (even in minor characters), and original choice of settings make it a complex and satisfying experience.  WARNING:  if your taste is for fast MTV-style cutting, simplistic caricatures, and/or a movie ruled by flashy special effects work, this film is not for you.  All others thirsting for a plot/character-driven ""horror"" film (or who have ever felt themselves to be ""outsiders"") will find this piece to be well worth while.  (As a previous review noted, it's also rare [for an American production] in its use of nudity to comment on and inform the characters and their actions.)",1067212800,6,1047,5.419753086419753
7962791,2,B000067DI1,"I rented this because I seen a few people on here liked it, but let me tell you, it wasn't so hot!. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one was the scene with the poodle.
  The break down: cheesy FX, it did have an original story line, not enough carnage, too much time killing (and not enough real killing), TRIED TOO HARD TO BE A MUSICAL!!!!! Every few minutes you will be treated with a musical/singing/dancing with the sideshow freaks (yea, yea, I know, someone right now is thinking, well that sounds cool, trust me its not!! sound of music meets teen wolf!!!) Its that bad!",1052265600,,588,4.336363636363636
7962792,2,B000067DI1,"Jeez, I don't think there is such a thing as a good werewolf movie.  I mean, eveyone always praises ""An American Werewolf in London"", but it was too drawn out and had little plot.  ""The Howling"" is almost good, but it had that stupid sex scene.  Why do they all have to have sex scenes?  I would have liked ""Bad Moon"", had it not been for the awful special effects.
Now, ""Blood Moon.""  This looks promising from the cover.  Tim Curry does do a wonderful job as the side-show promoter.  Still, the film's originality is not what I wanted.  Sure, the plot of a wolf girl from a freak show turning into a human, but becoming more animal-like sounds like a good idea.  But I wanted a werewolf movie!  Is it wrong for the person to change during every full moon these days?  Do they all have to gradually change throughout the film?  ""Ginger Snaps"" [disappointed] because they did it that way (not to mention all the unnecessary swear words).
Believe me, this movie is just a poor girl who wants to be human, but gets it in an ironic way.  And if you don't like seeing a young man naked and sporting extremely small genetalia, don't see this one.
Special note:  Not once in the entire film is there a monster that looks at all like the one on the cover of the box.  And i won't buy it just for the box.",1025049600,2,1297,4.258196721311475
7962793,4,B000067DI1,"I rented this film solely on a chance and found myself really, really suprised at just how well done it was.
Since, as of this writing, there is no plot synopsis here, I will include a brief one. A travelling sideshow, run by Tim Curry, pulls into a small town. It's star attraction is a young girl born covered in hair and billed as The Wolfgirl. She encounters taunts and threats from a group of young townie teenagers, as well as the posibility for a cure for her malady from the local misfit. The cure seems to work, but with the side effect that the previously gentle girl begins to experience more animalistic urges even as she physically becomes more ""human"".
This film seems to have come out of nowhere. It actually saw life on the USA Network as ""Wolfgirl"". I hadn't heard of it under either title. Neither name is particularly good, but hey, it's nit picking. The film far outshines such a stuff for a number of reasons.
The cast: Tim Curry is a perfect choice for Harley. He balances a desire for the financial survival of his show with a paternal love and respect for his performers. His is a colorful, yet flawed character, one whom you can easily both like and be angry with, and he makes it very believable. Grace Jones shows far more range than usual and makes great use of her androgeny in playing a half man/half woman. Darlene Cates, the mother from ""Gilbert Grape"" again amazes as Athena The Fat Lady. One wishes she could grace the screen more often. And Victoria Sanchez, as Tara The Wolfgirl, manages to truly seem beautiful beneath a full hairy make-up job. She is really phenomenal in a brave role for such a lovely looking young lady.
The rest of the cast is equally talented, and I would speak more of them, but for the desire to compliment some very special members. The performers of the freak show are anything but freaks. With the exception of Sanchez and Jones, almost every other sideshow performer is the real deal, and they shine. We are given a chance to see these people in everyday mode, not just as part of the show. The family they portray is believable and breathtaking. Never are they shown in anything but the most repectful light and when they get individual chances to act within character, they are, to a one, believable. Of particular note is Jordan Prentice as Finger Finnian, Harley's right hand man. Not a single false note whenever he is on screen.
The production: What an amazing-looking film! Marvelous production design gives the sideshow scenes an almost other-worldly quality. That the film was shot in Romania only adds to this old world feel within contemporary society. And Paul Jones' JoJo the Dog-Faced Boy make up design for Sanchez as the Wolfgirl is completely convincing. Really. Thom Fitzgerald's direction is biased towards the actors, as it should be here, but he also keeps the pace going and the details clear.
The songs: The sideshow performances themselves are often in musical form with some delightfully bawdy and clever tunes by John Roby. It really gives the film a special touch. It's also great to hear Curry get to sing with the broadness that we remember from Rocky Horror. If there is a CD out there with these songs, I want it! There is also a great Ani DiFranco tune ofver the end credits.
So, why does this film only get four stars after all this laudatory talk? The screenplay, while hitting the mark on the human end of things, seems to go slightly awry when it comes to the horror end of things. When there is violence or the like, it seems somwhat out of place, as if there was a story to tell, but that it was felt that it would only be marketable as a horror flick. It's too bad, because the emotional root is so strong (with the added idea that the ""freaks"", who are so obviously different, are not the ones with something to be ashamed of). Also, where are the police in this town? With all the delinquint juvvie activity, fearsome wolf attacks, etc., there's nary a cop in sight! Still, I would not hesitate to recommend this film. The four stars is relative to all other films, but that lack of a fifth should not be counted against it.
One final note: This film was suprising in how little it held back in a number of areas, particularly nudity, which is sometimes used for a truly appropriate ""shock"". I didn't have a problem with it, but it was so unexpected (and I'm not spoiling anything here) and unique that I was a bit taken aback. It's not what we're used to seeing in any mainstream film and some more prickly folk should be made aware.
With ""Ginger Snaps"" a short while ago, the fem-Werewolf themed film is having a suprising little uprising of quality cinema!",1024963200,19,4665,4.561382598331347
