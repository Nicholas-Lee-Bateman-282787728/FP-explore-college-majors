6657257,5,B00NIPQURG,"I'm a big fan of TPB and I was lucky enough to see this show live in Denver, CO. Or as Ricky referred to it ""Demver, Colohio"" haha great performances by everyone, people in the crowd brought Lahey a bottle of brandy and he swigged off of it! Much weed was thrown on stage and was completely awesome! See this show live!",1433635200,,319,4.161290322580645
6657258,5,B00NIPQURG,"An interesting mix of live action, improv and filmed comedy. The boys start out with a Trailer Park Boys  episode and they take it on the road to the North Pole, located in Minnesota. If you're a fan of the show you'll love it. If you are new to the show you'll still laugh, but a warning, there's lots of swearing and suggested sexuality involving onion rings and ketchup. Leahy is off the hook, again.",1433203200,,403,4.373333333333333

6657261,4,B00NIPQURG,"The main cast of Trailer Park Boys had a Christmas stage show, and boy did I want to see it. Not living in the Northeast, I was unable to, so luckily they put out this show. I thought that overall it was pretty good with some hysterical parts. It was filmed in Minneapolis with a live audience who got to interact during some parts. I would say that if you are a diehard fan you will probably enjoy this, but being live it has a little different feel.",1420416000,3,451,4.136363636363637

6657269,3,B00NIPQURG,"but I don't see keeping it back to savor when I am in a bad mood like the seasons themselves;
 for some reason I am reminded of Kevin Smith live discs, without the misanthropic perversity and persecution complex in search of a twelve step program, mostly because I wonder how much of the audience is wondering ""did I pay for this? shouldn't I be home getting blown (up) and watching TV?""",1464998400,,387,4.450704225352113
