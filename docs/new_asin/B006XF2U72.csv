5036805,5,B006XF2U72,"This is not a movie against war, our military or our country.
This is a film by a war vet and pastor who is reviewing the effects HE has personally experienced and his working to help others who are in the midst of the struggle now...

This film is not for the faint of heart.  This film discusses some very deep topics such as killing others.

The warning I have for you is it is WAR: There are pictures and videos of death, and live combat movies.
Discussions about bodies with holes from the bullets etc..

This is NOT a family film or an educational film for your children.

If you have friends and family who are military and unsaved this is a great film to help reach them.",1345334400,9,679,4.232558139534884

8506324,4,B006XF2U72,"Often books tell a ""story"" that opens with a background and leads you through to an anticipated ending.  This is a very good book, and it does tell a ""story"".  But not in the conventional format.  It is more of a documentary format.  As many realistic documentaries are, this one does not sugar-coat anything.  For this type of format, it is very good.",1478131200,,352,4.523809523809524

8506327,4,B006XF2U72,"Let me start by saying I am a God fearing christain and a veteran. I recently served in Afghanistan as a medic in 2012 and after returning home thier was many issues I struggled with. For example the sovereignty of God. Then one day I heard pastor Raul Riese was also a veteran and was making a movie that highlighted his experiences in the war and how that led to his walk with Christ. Immediately I had the expectation that this movie would be a great resource for other believers that may struggle with PTSD or in my case ""battle stress"". Unfortunately I was disappointed. This movie in my opinion was more about the biography of pastor Raul Riese and not so much the tools that God had have him to overcome the PTSD/battle stress trials.",1427587200,,741,4.455882352941177

8506332,5,B006XF2U72,"So many Vietnam veterans are still hurting.  I watched this movie with my husband who served our country in Vietnam November 1967 thru November 1968.  Something he's needed to see for a long time; and me, too, cause it's not talked about much.  Healing continues and gets a little better each day.  This dvd was gut honest and true.  There's a lot of hurting veterans out there.  Thank you for taking the time and the love and the honesty that was poured into this project.  As his wife for 46 years, I now understand a lot more.  Thank you and God bless you.",1369353600,3,559,4.359223300970874
