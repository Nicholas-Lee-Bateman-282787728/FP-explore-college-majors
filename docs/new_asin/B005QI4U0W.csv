5935173,5,B005QI4U0W,"When the US version of the Harry Potter 1-8 films came out it was priced at $100.
I noticed that the UK version on amazon.co.uk was priced at 40 pounds, which translated to $84 which is a lot better than $100!

This itself is the UK version of the films, but it's region-free, which means the disc play in any region, whether your from the UK, USA, Australia, etc.

I really love this box set, it has 4 DVD covers, with two movies in each case.

Really nicely packaged and a great deal!",1337904000,,486,4.204301075268817
5935174,4,B005QI4U0W,"The Blu-ray collections include all seven series of Harry Potter movies. In the first 3 disks, it also has Chinese (as well as other languages) caption, which eases our watching. Very good collections to see all Harry Potter's movies.",1333497600,,234,5.0256410256410255
5935175,5,B005QI4U0W,"Our family wanted to get the Harry Potter movies after reading the series. The movies are great. We love all of the ""behind the scenes"" features. The only confusion was that we got the ""Region Free"" and didn't realize that we would be getting the European version in which the first movie is named, ""The Philosopher's Stone"" instead of ""The Scorcerers Stone"". But the movie is the same.",1332806400,,386,4.6911764705882355
5935176,5,B005QI4U0W,"I have read the reviews and some people say the special features Blue Rays does not play in US. It is probably due to the need to update the framework of the Blue-ray player, because all the blue-rays including the special features ones does play in United States. I have them and I love them. I live in New York! I strongly suggest this collection from UK better than the one offered by US. The special features of this Blue-ray collection is amazing! Be aware that the UK version of this set is sold in amazon.co.uk as well as in amazon.com.",1330646400,,543,4.3861386138613865

Clearly basic dvd format I know it won't be the best compared to Blu-ray and 4K but standard dvd shouldnt look as if someone is FaceTiming me while watching the movie themselves in theater. Thats what it looks like. A blurry movie, and I already wear glasses so for me things should be clear as day!
Already in the returning process.
Best if you just go in a store and buy it for $5 or $10 more. That at least can be a bit more trusted.

The main difference is in the quality of the packaging and the movie on screen menus. There is a lower production value in the UK than in the single US movies that I own.

I still think it is, but now I am also of the opinion that it's a good movie with a cute little narrative. That being said, I don't think textbooks need to be turned into movies, and it takes a different tone toward the creatures than is in the actual ""Fantastic Beasts"" book. However, 9/10 have watched multiple times.",1529539200,,410,4.337662337662338

The new characters are engaging, and the creatures are the creations of someone with a knowledge of zoology...and a LOT of imagination. I'm really excited to learn that the next film in what's advertised to be a five film series, will be released in November. Jacob, Queenie, Newt and the rest will be back in the sequel.

I'm not a huge fan of the original Harry Potter movies, though I am a HUGE FAN of the books. I thought it was just because I'm not really a ""see all the movies"" kind of person.
Then I saw this. A few days later, it became the only movie I've ever seen twice in the theater. My husband, not a Potterhead at all, is anxiously awaiting the next in this series. We even named our dog after one of the characters.
I think it's because this is the mind of JKR, directly made into a movie script, rather than an adaptation from a book. I'm just one of those book people. Either way, it's a fantastic film all on its own.",1522713600,,684,4.111940298507463

Include the registration card with the original non working redemption code and the original box with the BRs.  They will then send you a working copy including not just the original films but the two with extended versions.  They all look and sound terrific.  All for a current price right at 45 bucks.

5935455,1,B005QI4U0W,Who told Redmayne he could act? I could barely understand his mumbling.  The rest of the movie seemed pretty helter skelter to me. Not impressed even with the CGI.,1520812800,,163,4.620689655172414
5935456,1,B005QI4U0W,"There were many things to like about this movie, but the deal breaker for me was the incredibly inappropriate hinting at sexual abuse of a minor.  Yes, it was the bad guy doing this, but those hints failed to make it as wholly unappealing and dirty - paving yet another street by which main-stream media tries to normalize sick, degrading and abusive actions.  The abuse was implicit in several interactions with highly sensual overtones, but nothing else about the film questioned or made it clear that this was wrong - and the minor in question also seemed to never have a problem with it.  Everybody, including the audience, was apparently supposed to ignore the implications and thus we are all made complicit in grooming / sexual abuse of minors.  So very very wrong.",1520812800,,772,4.7819548872180455

The special features disc was unreadable for my region, and no amount of attempts could make its contents known. That was disappointing, and I am not sure what the cause for that was.",1520467200,,445,4.705128205128205

I just sent them a picture of the box set with the code and a copy of my receipt.  I want to give it 5 stars.  The package looks fantastic.  The discs are in cardboard sleeves I know these will get tore up eventually but they look amazing.  As I said before it all works on my player so I am guessing they are region free.

5935558,5,B005QI4U0W,"I. LOVE. THIS. MOVIE.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched it, to be honest. I'm a huge fan of the HP films so when this came out, I kinda brushed it off. BOY was I wrong for that. The characters are SO well written and the actors that portray them are perfect. But why am I crying? I'm not sure. Maybe it's because everyone else is? Because I relate so much to each of these characters? How do you do that? How do you capture one person's emotions and spread them out among several characters? JK Rowling, would love to know how. But I seriously cry each time I watch it.

I love the 20s NYC setting and the clothes are perfect. If I could be Queenie and Seraphina at the same time, I'd do it. But all of the women are SO smart and powerful, which I love. I am really looking forward to the next installment this year. I bought the screenplay as well to study it as I'm hoping to delve into screenwriting on the side.",1517443200,,926,4.082417582417582

Each movie has a corresponding extra-features blu-ray with commentary, interviews, trailers and some deleted scenes. I do not think the first and maybe the second movie was filmed in full 1080 High-def as the resolution seems to be about 720p which is half way between the 600 resolution of DVD and the 1080 of blu-ray.

5935667,3,B005QI4U0W,"I'm making it a point to use the title of the film as a headline because an awful lot of the posted reviews seem to be about an 8 disc Harry Potter collection...

Perhaps, like me, you're in withdrawl from the magical world of Harry Potter.  You've read all the books multiple times, watched the movies so much that you say the lines with the characters, and have every tie in imaginable.  You know your Hogwarts House, you await your letter each fall with eagerness - and disappointment when it doesn't arrive.  You're all about the rights of house elves but sorely disappointed that none arrive to help with the housekeeping.  You've considered shipping various characters together in a variety of mixes, but wait!  A new Harry Potter movie, based off the book that you got when it was first issued?  So in!  I picked up the book copy of the script to be ready when it was released, and... Well, I hoped it would translate better to the screen, sad to say.

Visually, this movie is lovely, and probably would have been even better on the big screen rather than my computer monitor.  The creatures and the world they inhabit are marvelously done, complete with music swelling at the appropriate times.  The actors do their job well, convincing enough at their characters that you stop calling Eddie Redmayne ""the guy who played Stephen Hawking"" by a few minutes in.  Explosions, check.  Magic shields, check.  Magic terminology - new, American magic terminology! - check.  Allusions to Harry Potter's world - check, with a cheer each time.

And yet... This is a movie based on a textbook based on a book.  Even spinning parts of the rest of the series in, that's not a lot to base a feature length film off of, which regretfully shows in the film.  Even understanding that this is establishing a base to jumpstart a new movie series, it felt weak, a visual spectacle lacking subtance.  Will I see the next one?  Well, yes, see the Harry Potter fan freak out a couple paragraphs above.  I hope it's overall better than this, though.",1514592000,4,2032,4.635854341736695

5935750,5,B005QI4U0W,"This is a review for Harry Potter: The Complete 16 Disc Blu-Ray Set.

I at first bought the 8 disc set thinking it had all of the bonus features upon reading reviews not realizing Amazon has combined all the reviews for all of the HP disc sets. I returned that and bought the 16 disc set only to learn there was The Hogwargs Collection (the 31 disc set). I was super bummed seeing that it was ~$150. I decided to check into the special features to see if it was the same (without the DVDs - just Blu-Ray discs). It doesnt tell you in the description so its hard to tell but to me it looks like this 16 disc collection is the same as the 31 disc collections simply without the DVDs EXCEPT for the following:

 There is a bonus disc in the 31 disc collection. It has according to another users review the following...

When Harry Left Hogwarts - Extended Version (the 16 Disc Collection has this but possibly not the extended version)
50 Greatests HP Moments (not seeing this on the 16 Disc Collection)
Designing the World of HP (Not seeing this on the 16 Disc Collection BUT it does have Warner Bros Studio Tour London - The Making of HP)
& More! Not sure what the & More according to the other reviewer BUT there are MANY more special features on this last DVD of the 16 Disc Collection that aren't mentioned above such as Harrys Last Stand (Ext. Version), The Women of HP, The Goblins is Gringotts, The Great Hall of Hogwarts, Deleted Scenes and more.

So again, it looks like this collection is very similar to the 31 disc collection minus the DVDs (since, again, its just the blue ray DVDs). I might be missing a couple of special features on the very last disc but to me it looks like the rest of the special features for the other 7 movies are included in both collections.

Which collection should you buy? If you want to save loads of money and still have almost all of the special features then buy the 16 disc version versus the 31 disc collection. IF you don't have a Blu-Ray DVD player then my suggestion is buy the 16 disc collection and with all that money you didn't spend on the 31 disc collection buy a dang Blu-Ray player. ;) Hope this helps and leaves you less confused!",1512172800,,2188,4.324390243902439
5935751,4,B005QI4U0W,"Enjoyable movie for the Harry Potter fan. Excellent acting for the most part (minus Colin Farrell). Particularly enjoyed Dan Fogler as Kowalski.

The best part were the scenes with the fantastic beasts (makes sense). But, a major plot hole to me kept popping up and creating a lot of annoyance for me. At one point we see the process we saw in the Harry Potter movies with the memories being removed and viewed. There's also a scene that includes that process in this movie (I won't go into detail).

But, if accusers and authorities are able to to extract and view memories, why the need for interrogation and falsely imprisoning? They could easily have proven that Newt's intentions were honorable and that Tina wasn't involved in any wrongdoing.

That one point, so obvious (and used in the movie) really took me out of the ""suspended disbelief"" that is normally so easy to do with the Harry Potter movies.

5935770,1,B005QI4U0W,"This is only the second movie in my 52 years I've walked out on, and that was because my 11 year old son said he was bored. The simple fact is, so was I, so we left. We walked. On a $50 freaking movie bill, we walked.

I wanted to give it another chance, but, guess what, it is still dull and boring. I've forced my way through 40 minutes, and just can't handle watching more. The characters, we don't care about. The situations, overdone. In fact, my feeling is, they were trying just too hard . They had some awfully big shoes to fill, and they were just trying too hard to do it. The pacing was just way too slow, but more than that I just couldn't really empathize with the characters. When you care about the characters, the pacing takes a back seat. It just seemed to go on and on about how magic stuff works -- but we already knew that. It needed to not be some kind of thing that needed to be emphasized, a focus on character and faster pacing would have helped. I mean, for one example, is it really necessary to show dishes flying into place on a table? In a rather prolonged sequence? Haven't we all seen this before? Show it happening, sure... 10 seconds worth would be enough though. Maybe the muggle, or ""nomag"" or whatever, was awed by it -- I wasn't. And even that guy, good grief, just seemed to accept it all without questioning. I mean, OK. Just a few minutes later, your roommate for the night jumps down a bag. Do you wonder what the Hell is going on? No, obviously, you just follow him down. And get a ""joke"", and a poor one, in about his girth. Didn't fat jokes go out of style some time ago? Or does that only apply to women?

I think the main problem is that the main protagonists are way, way too passive. Newt is passive to the point of almost apathy. That could be played on as a man out of his own element (England v. US), but it never really was. Even the main lady just takes a load of crap, never even expresses how that makes her feel... if this is all leading up to some sort of boiling point, I'm sorry; the writers screwed up. You don't make your audience wait through an hour or more of BS to get there. And again, Newt is so passive as to be unlikable; not good. Or for at least the first 40 minutes, the ""star"" kind of just gets led around by others, not really doing a damn thing. Is that really how Englishmen are? I've met a few. Not in my experience. In fact, Englishmen are very direct, in most cases, where us yanks would not be. This stereotype of the ""proper English Gentleman"" can be taken just so far before it becomes tedious -- unless you're playing it for laughs (Monty Python anyone?). Real people are not like that, even in England. Or at least, I certainly hope not and believe not. And for heaven's sakes, this was mainly made by Englishmen.

All in all, I just simply can't recommend this. I am truly, truly sorry. I very much wanted this to be ""the new Harry Potter"". It just isn't, plain and simple. I didn't want it to be like this, it's just how it turned out. Attack me if you must, but I do ask that any response be reasonable and salient and address the basic issues. I don't need, and won't respond, to personal attacks.",1511654400,,3185,4.200980392156863

Just because they are set in the same 'wizarding world' does not make them interchangeable. I clicked in because I enjoy getting other's opinions and insights on movies, and instead of people discussing the world of Fantastic Beasts, we have discussions about the different content of Harry Potter boxed sets.

As a die-hard Potterhead for over 15 years, I really wanted to watch the Potters again on my first Blu-Ray player and thus began the search for the perfect collection where I can get both the movies and the special features without missing anything. The result of course, was futile, but that didn't discourage me. I came across 3 editions here, the old ""3 faces of Harry"" UK version (the priciest, about $85), the US version with the Hogwarts castle cover (a bit cheaper, about $68) and this one, being the new UK version (the cheapest, about $44). What I found-out interestingly enough though, is that in terms of completeness, this version seems to be by far the best one, especially considering its price. Having said that though, it's not without its quirks.

The collection being a 16-disc set with an array of special features, it seems to easily defeat the 8-disc US version by a mile. When compared with the old 11-disc UK version though, it still seems to win, but not by a whole lot. So let me give a quick run-down of the features which I believe are missing in this when compared to it-

1) Minimal interactive disc menus for the movies- what you get for the most part are small, neat, pop-up menus that have all the buttons of course, just without the background menu animations of the original DVDs
2) Next to none interactive games- I remember that there were a few small games in the original Goblet of Fire special disc which were not in here. Not a big deal really, but they still should have been in this ""complete"" version.
3) Light packaging- with cardboard disc sleeves that have a lot to be desired. Clearly a move to cut-down on the pricing, which I appreciate in some ways, but the 4 very delicate cases really are quite awkward for holding 4 discs each, I had a small tear in one case upon receiving it. The artworks are ok though.

However there are a lot of special features here amounting to hours upon hours of material which I believe are not in the old UK version, making this the more preferable. The beautiful 8-hour ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" documentary and the compilation of TV specials/spots contained here chief among them.

Apart from that, what it does have is every single special feature of the original discs, from the numerous and highly enjoyable documentary featurettes and Focus Points to the fascinating, but at times irksome visual commentaries of the last 3 films. They are very fun to watch for any Potterhead and I enjoyed them all a lot. Really takes you into the production of these feats of magic and makes you feel as if you're engaging with the cast/crew then and there. I do wish however, that the cast/crew did some audio commentaries for the films, it would have been great to hear them react to various scenes, reliving their experiences impromptu and giving some insights on the go, nothing really beats that.

As for the movies themselves, I don't think that anyone who's into Fantasy/Adventure can really not enjoy a Harry Potter movie, at least guiltily. I'm not going to touch on them a lot since this is not entirely a movie review, but apart from being my childhood, they are some of the best in the genre and the best thing about them is that they always hold-up as engaging, cinematically sensible movies first and as parts of a series, second. I've seen them in various formats throughout the years, from the cinema to DVDs/VCDs, and the transfers here are pretty-well done, though nothing much to write home about. The video quality is enriched by just a tiny bit and the audio is decent though I just wish that they had 7.1 instead of the 5.1. And although being in Widescreen (which I prefer), the black-bars here seemed to be fixed on a 1080p and that was a little disappointing since it limits the detail of the images a little bit.

The only issue I had with the movie discs was that the last one seemed to have some bad data as it kind of skipped for about 10 seconds in the Hog's Head scene. Quite disappointing since it was supposed to be a primed disc. Another annoying issue I had with the discs is that some of the special features, like the ""Meet the Champions"" documentary from the Goblet of Fire was repeated in both the movie disc, and the special features disc. This was true for most of the deleted scenes as well. It just seems like a cheap and lazy move on part of the disc-makers to fill-up disc space.

The other thing about the special features is that although they're quite enjoyable, they tend to have a lot of the same things, like interviews, repeated/edited throughout in multiple features. The 8-hour documentary avoids that for the most part thankfully, but it can get boring to hear the same lines repeated over and over again, especially in the old TV specials. This is especially annoying since the cast/crew seems to read heavily off a script for most of them and some even seems to just use multiple takes across them in some instances, which was weird. There are for the most part, no new titbits touched upon in many of them, so it can get too old too quickly.

The Ultraviolet is available in the UK and not in Asia, where I live. But I don't like downloading huge files so it's no great loss to me either way.

Overall though, this is quite a solid buy of a collection and gets most things right. It's certainly going to be the only Potter collection I'll have for the foreseeable future. Recommended for anyone interested in the genre.

Pros:
Eddie Redmaynes nuanced performance. If they write him out of the series I will be sorely pissed off. His character arc has sooo much room for growth in very interesting ways.
The cast was excellent, giving brilliant interpretations to their characters.
Brilliant storytelling (off to an excellent start!)
Fantastic, colorful, beautifully designed beasts - CGI was excellent.
3D format was very good.
A Harry Potter series made for adults.

Cons:
Many may find the lead hero and his mates to be uninteresting as present day movies have conditioned us to want popcorn fluff that is fast and flashy.",1509926400,,639,5.076190476190476

I played these on my PS4 here in the US. I really wish the digital version on Amazon were cheaper or anywhere but they are $70 and you don't even get the extra bonus or disc etc... so this was a great deal.

Not much to say otherwise, we thought about just renting them on Amazon or iTunes but it was cheaper to just buy them and then have them to watch again if we wanted to.

Hope this helps! If you haven't been to Harry Potter in Universal be sure and check it out. It's like being in the movie, crazy cool! Waiting on the 4K UHD versions to buy as well",1509926400,,704,3.9160839160839163

5935843,4,B005QI4U0W,"You don't need to be familiar with the Harry Potter franchise at all to be able to enjoy this spin-off that is aimed at adults, though the storyline and characterizations are overall pretty safe for most older kids, but not the younger set. What I did have an issue with and can see others take issue with is how the bad person is a bigoted religious fanatic who took in kids and then was physically abusive to them. The religion is not specifically identified but most sane people will recognize that it smacks of Christianity. The problem is not that this person is portrayed as the bad person and has a religious bent, its that there is no balance given to them (how many movies can you think of where the bad guy is humanized to the point of empathy?) and so it feels like the film goes out of its way to take a whack at Christianity/ Christians as being hypocritical, angry, fear-mongering individuals. Thats a problem and while I did like the movie I didn't like that element all the moreso because there was no effort to counterbalance it. While the HP villain Voldemort was an adult he did make use of younger kids but they were never as intensely corrupted, or portrayed in such a way, as FBAWTFT portrays them. The issue of child abuse, regardless of who is abusing the child, and makes the films characterizations that much more insidious. These elements are disturbing and will probably be too disturbing to children 9 and under Id wager. Many Christians will have a problem with the whole witches, wizards, and witchcraft/ magic stuff but if you set that aside this is simply another fantasy adventure with more of an emphasis this time around on the strange and fantastic creatures that the hero tends to. The hero is an adult, as are his companions in this film, and so it gives it a different feel. Its a lesser entry into the franchise though enjoyable for people who like watching fanciful creatures and monsters and magical doings. 3.75 stars.",1509494400,,1962,4.6085714285714285

5935903,4,B005QI4U0W,The movies are new in wrap and work just fine. The only thing thats wrong with it is that some of the movies are flipped around. The dvd that says sorcerers stone is actually chamber of secrets and vice versa. That's the only issue I had with it.,1507939200,,246,4.145833333333333

5935913,5,B005QI4U0W,Like all the Harry Potter films the magic of the film is in the incredible depth of details. I like to look for the small things that a placed in the films that are background fillers. The level of detail in all of J.K.

5935963,5,B005QI4U0W,"I loved this movie and expect to watch it several more times. There was so much going on that it was a little tough to take it all in. Bless JK Rowling for gifting us with more magic!

SPOILER ALERT:

I love that none of the animals were cuddly and all were quite naughty by human standards. I watched some crazy people on YouTube earlier today trying to raise and keep a wild fox in their house and a similar level of hilarity and destruction occurred, e.g. jumping up on furniture to knock everything off and then poop! On the furniture. Tables & couches & whatnot.

Wild animals are wild and belong in their habitats. Who knew that a magic movie could make this point so beautifully? Unless you're running a certified & professional wild animal rehabilitation facility - or are a world expert on magical beasts - don't bring them into your kitchen, or if you do, expect mayhem to ensue!",1506643200,,889,4.4753086419753085

5935981,3,B005QI4U0W,"It's definitely in the good not great category.

Anything in the Harry Potter universe is going to be fun, and this is no exception. The magic effects were good and the new beasts were charming. The novelty of it being set in America kept things interesting, and subtle callbacks to plot points we already know made it familiar as well.

That being said, the plot was a little disjointed, and I don't think the love story between the two main characters was believable. The ending was somewhat underwhelming, but not horrible by any means.

3/5 really says it. If you're a fan of the series then you'll probably like it, but don't expect it to knock your socks off.",1506124800,,665,4.571428571428571

It was am unbeatable price for all the movies on Blu-ray. My only criticism is that we have to turn the volume on our tv to maximum to be able to hear them.,1506038400,,315,4.180327868852459
5935987,1,B005QI4U0W,"I'm surprised this movie has good reviews. I guess the fans are just diehard, which is fine.  I loved HP, but this was dull start-to-finish. Every 5 minutes I looked at the time. When is the movie going to get interesting and enchanting, I wondered? It never does. The sets, costumes, cinematography, and acting are all bleak, depressing and lacking in energy. The Americans are played by Brits who apparently think that all it takes to portray an American is an accent. Americans of that era were plucky and way more charismatic than the dour way they were portrayed here. This is an incredibly, massively boring movie, and the magic and animals lacked creativity.  Not JK's best source material, and definitely the worst of her books that made it to film.  Skip this and watch any of the Harry Potter movies instead.",1506038400,,818,4.746478873239437

Not so. There is no plot to speak of; what story is there does not make sense, the characters are flat and one dimensional, and the beasts serve as eye candy at best (and not even the best CGI eye candy you can get these days). JK was clearly just cashing this one in; I'm surprised she let her name go down as the writer. Not worth the time if you are older than 5.",1506038400,2,540,4.152380952380953

5936085,3,B005QI4U0W,"Fantastic Beasts has great characters. Honestly, some of the most genuine and likeable characters i've seen in awhile. I wanted to root for these characters. I wanted to see these characters grow and evolve. I wanted to learn more about the creatures and why Newt has become so attached to protecting and learning about them. So, I was pretty disappointed to see where the film went and how it ultimately ended.

The plot is just too heavy and gives no room for character development. The movie seems so focused on building the world and the American Magical Police/Government system that it barely takes time to explain anything it brings up. The beasts (you know, the creatures the movie is named after) are rarely shown or really spoken about and serve only as a MacGuffin and eventually a Deus ex Machina for the plot. And the plot itself is all over the place. Bouncing between plotlines I really could care less about and special effect extravaganzas that leave no lasting impact on the story. I was honestly bored through most of the film. I wanted a story about the characters and instead I got a bland story about the corruption of the American magical society and some evil guy who really had no reason being there. Which is extremely disappointing considering what they had to work with.

I've heard of people absolutely loving this film. And, i'm really glad to hear it. Because I want this franchise to continue, if only for them to actually focus on the characters and drop the pointless side plots. I was never a fan of Harry Potter, so I don't know how well fans of that franchise will react to this movie. It's definitely not Harry Potter. However, i'd recommend people watch it if only for the characters. I do look forward to the next film, I just hope it'll fix the problems of this one.",1504396800,,1807,4.626168224299065

5936126,5,B005QI4U0W,"If you are a fan of the book or just a fan of J.K. Rowling in general I feel like you will enjoy this movie.
J.K. Rowling gives us another taste of the magical world that we all know and love from Harry Potter only this time giving the focus to some new characters as well as magical creatures.
The story is very smooth with just enough suspense, action, and drama so keep you awake and interested throughout the whole movie. While the characters are so well written that you often find yourself having a love hate relationship with some of them as they make certain choices throughout the story/movie.
To touch on the special effects and graphics of the creatures and actions I can only say that they keep getting better and better and I am at a loss for how they make magical moments on screen come to life for those of us watching it.",1503964800,,837,4.337579617834395

Too much reliance on special effects. Character development and story were poorly done. Lots of incompetence in the characters, lost of chasing around and going nowhere. Frustrating. Now it's all over I ask myself why did Newt even go to NY in the first place.

I liked this film a great deal, but was so depressed by the fact that Jacob ends up not being part of the magical community crushed me.

5936148,2,B005QI4U0W,"George R Martin said it best; ""Too much magic can kill a fantasy"". This movie is a perfect example of that. You've got 2 foot long bird snakes blowing up instantly into 300 foot long bird snakes, then shrinking down into 6 inch bird snakes, and other such nonsense. You've got 20 thousand pound rhinoceroses fitting into suitcases. You've got a vial of blue liquid that gives amnesia to an entire city. You've got spells that can reconstruct a destroyed sky-scraper in an instant. It's completely over the top. I know it's a movie about magic, but even so the best movies and series about magic have rules.  When you make a character all powerful with magic, he no longer has to be creative or clever with his use of it, and that's a lot less entertaining. This movie is saved from a one star review by great special effects, if we're still giving partial credit for good special effects these days,  and particularly good acting by Collin Farrell and a very endearing character played by Alison Sudol.",1503705600,,1002,4.623595505617978

5936232,4,B005QI4U0W,"Terrific movies, our son is enjoying them although it may be a few year before he can watch the last 3.

My only feedback is the packaging of the discs.  They come in nice cardboard folders, like modern music cds. However, the discs keep sliding out onto the floor.

Blu-ray Discs  normally remember a disc being previously viewed and offer to start where you left off; these don't do that. I mention these things because they may bug some, but it doesn't affect the final product.

As far as UV redemption, it's as simple as logging into flixster video and initiating a chat where you provide all of the necessary information. A help ticket is created via email at which point you attach pictures of the UV code + receipt. The requests are taken care of in the order it was received.

I was pretty disappointed. I kept waiting for it to really kick in, but it never did for me.
I WANTED to love it. I am an Eddie Redmayne fan, too, so I had high hopes.  I loved Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol's characters, and their storyline was, for me, one of the best parts of the movie.
For some reason I found myself not connecting to the woman Redmayne's character was drawn to. She kept trying to get him into trouble, and then ended up in trouble herself. I though, ""Good!"" lol.

5936294,2,B005QI4U0W,"Review for Fantastic Beasts.

It's hard to give this movie two stars. There were a lot of great things about it.

So why two stars? The main focus of the plot was lazy, trite, and completely missed the mark for what this movie SHOULD have been about.

So I give it one star for the special effects, and one star for the sequences with the magical beasts, and no more.

This SHOULD have been an interesting, fun, and memorable movie for kids of all ages. Instead much of it was dark and terrifying for kids. It speaks to the over-developed proclivity for darkness and tragedy that Rowling for some reason developed as the Harry Potter series moved along. This movie quickly became as schizophrenic as the later Potter books. Rowling has a great capacity for wonder, humor, and delightful slice of life scenes -- even if it is magical life. However, she at some point also wanted to be SERIOUS, and it detracted from her ability to entertain with her best storytelling qualities.

This movie demonstrates that clearly. The ""obscurius"" plot was from the odd desire to be serious, when a better story was obviously at hand just in the effort to recapture the creatures which had escaped. Cut out the dark nonsense, and you have a really great 40 minute or so movie.

For the product itself: The 3D blu ray presentation is excellent. There is a great sense of depth, and some objects/creatures come right out of the screen. I have nothing but praise for the technical aspects of the film and the product.",1501977600,,1499,4.616541353383458

The ""sleeves"" that hold the discs are thin and don't hold the discs too well but at this cost, I can't complain! Just a little extra care and the sleeves should last.

5936364,1,B005QI4U0W,"The premise seems interesting and relevant to our times: an eco-zoologist trying to save endangered species, a person spewing hate for those who are different, and a variety of characters acting to make the world better according to their own conflicting viewpoints. And the CGI is truly remarkable.

But as the final deus ex machina unfolded, I found myself wishing that I had those two hours back. And wondering why the wizarding world would every be afraid of 1920s no-majs (er, muggles). Or why the European magic community was so selfish as to not help with the rebuilding effort after WWII.

My biggest issue with the film is that it completely lacked nuance. The bad guys were very bad, the good guys were bumbling but destined to win, and all the little plot twists that could have been interesting were thrown away almost as soon as they were introduced. And then there was that ""prison"" scene that made me wonder if all of the American witches and warlocks are simply psychopaths.

On top of that, the acting just wasn't that good. I don't blame the actors for this; I blame the CGI. I have to believe that a green screen wipes away empathy and emotion in a way that a set or even a bare stage does not. At times it was simply painful to watch, as when Newt interacts with some of the larger beasts. Perhaps a motion-capture puppet would have helped? Or perhaps not.",1501372800,,1376,4.585365853658536

What made the magic was the chemistry among players with Daniel Radcliff that made the movie shine.

5936412,3,B005QI4U0W,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan (of both the books and the movies). That said, I am very possessive of that storyline, and so I was a little hesitant to watch this other movie because I didn't want anything to tarnish the Harry Potter world for me. I finally got around to watching Fantastic Beasts, and while it was a decent movie, I admit I do feel let down. It relies heavily on all the background constructed in Harry Potter, and so many viewers dove into this film with an already established knowledge of the wizarding world. With that in place, though, it did not focus enough on the character development needed to endear viewers to this new saga...and new characters. Eddie Redmayne fulfilled his role as an awkward but kind ""animal"" lover and protector, but aside from that, I don't feel like the audience got to connect with him or any of the other characters on an emotional level. There were also a few things going on that didn't jive with what I know about J.K. Rowling's wizarding world. The movie itself is more sinister, and the argument could be made that this movie was more adult and therefore more maturely themed, but it wasn't compelling enough for me. The magic I felt in the Harry Potter movies just never transcended. The CGI beasts and settings were very impressive, but I needed a bit more; I didn't care about them aside from admiring their appearances. And I felt no chemistry between Newt and Tina, so I didn't understand their friendship and/or budding romance.

If I view this as a standalone movie, and not connected to Harry Potter, my opinion of it may be a little bit higher than the 3 stars. But because the Harry Potter movies were so good, and this is an extension of that world, my opinion dropped because it was lackluster in comparison.",1500854400,,1777,4.570532915360501

BUT, one thing that irritated the hell out of me, I could not clearly hear what the actors were saying in some scenes unless I turned my volume up to 100.  In some scenes  it sounded like Eddie Redmayne had a mouth full of marbles.  I don't understand why the sound engineers feel the greater need to blast the actions sequences, but fail to keep the voices at the same level.  It had a story & I don't find that once again the sound engineers feel that they need to pay more attention to the volume of the actions scenes. IMHO.

Does not dissapoint.,1500163200,,298,4.6415094339622645
5936494,3,B005QI4U0W,"Fantastic Beasts was full of strong performances, took the Potter world into a darker, different direction, but I felt as if the narrative lost its direction and veered into something more epic than I really wanted. Now, thats said from a guy that loves epic fantasy, that writes epic fantasy, that pushed on reading through 14, 900+ page novels of the Wheel of Time, despite 100s of pages where nothing happened of note. The simple reason I say this is because the derailing change in tone for Fantastic Beasts wasn't needed.

*MINOR SPOILER ALERT*  Though really, it's pretty obvious in the movie.

Newts story of visiting New York, losing some of his animals and having to find them, felt a lot more interesting to me than the eventual Grindelwald reveal with his desires to out wizard society and stop hiding behind the scenes; bringing about the eventual no-maj and wizard war that would result. While I wanted to see all of those underhanded dealings, and Farrells character was a beautiful mix of conflicted power and passion, I was annoyed as the retrieval of the beasts took a back seat.

One of the brilliant parts of Harry Potter is it started small. Yes, it was evident that Potter was akin to a chosen one, but for the most part it seemed that his time in the spotlight had already come and passed. His celebration was for what he had done, not for what he would do. Fantastic Beasts misses that beat for me, by trying to start too big right out of the gate. I loved the budding relationship with the baker, as Newt's strangely willing sidekick, and while we got some vignette scenes of them in the suitcase displaying Newts passion for the odd and magical, the release and recapture of the beasts was thoroughly trumped by building Story B.

Im not Rowling, but my inner writer was screaming to want to rewrite the script and push Story B into hints and foreshadowing that could lay the path to explode prominently on the scene in the sequel to Fantastic Beasts. There was enough drama and fun to let the retrieval of the beasts stand on its own as THE story.

I also have to say the climactic conclusion was just a back and forth mess where direction was lacking and it seemed the characters weren't even sure what they were supposed to be doing. Eventually it came together, and yes: it was big, it was tense, but the excitement and edge of your seat anticipation just felt forced.

Nevertheless, it was a solid movie, stronger than some of the Potter movies, even if it missed some of the pacing of the Harry Potter books.

As a fan of the Potterverse, one of the most exciting parts of the movie was imagining what may come with Rowling (maybe) delving into other side stories and building the world still greater and larger. Potter's story may be done, but there is so much more to tell.

I got this version that was listed as Blu-Ray but less than the default option. The description said 16 disks so I didn't ask questions and would see what it came with. This box came with Blu-ray and sound track for each movie of the movie AND the Digital downloads for them. This set isn't the American version with the Sorcerer's  Stone it's the UK version (Philosopher's stone (meaning that they change the few lines and the title from one to the other so it has little to no difference)). Because of the digital downloads being relative to the UK I needed to use a VPN to make my computer think I was either in Ireland or the UK otherwise the code comes up as invalid.
Because of this set having digital movies I am able to trophy the actual box and not have to take out the disks when I decided i want to watch one of the movies (the way today's media should be).

5936511,2,B005QI4U0W,"Please let me start by saying that Ive seen all (8) HP movies more times than I can count. I never read the books, but if (pretty much) the SAME people that produced one of the best series ever put to film could bring us another series in the HP universe, its going to be great, right?

Boy, was I wrong! I fell asleep twice, maybe three times. It was difficult to stay awake. The level of creativity, thought, and imagination is really missing from this movie. Its as if they had to put something (anything?) together for HP fans since 5 years has passed when the last film was released.

I don't think these are spoilers if you still haven't seen it yet (Yup! I know this movie has been out for a long time), but here are just some of my problems with the story and the film:

- Eddie Redmayne is such a great actor, and yet, he mumbled throughout the entire movie, I could barely understand a word he said. I turned up the sound, and still couldn't understand most of his dialog, but almost blew an eardrum when the destructive scenes played throughout NY.
- By the way, why was this film set in NY? I realize this isn't HP, but it wasn't necessary to change the setting either. The few good parts of film were inside the suitcase Newt was carrying anyway. Other than a few Americans, most of the main cast were foreign actors trying to sound American. I felt like they spent more time trying to get the accent right than their scenes.
- No-Majs? Really? Instead of calling them muggles, this is the lousiest word they can come up with for non-magic people in America.
- The movie would have been better without Tina (Katherine Waterston). It was just too irritating to watch her clumsy attempts at capturing Newt and his escaped creatures. I got the impression she spent most of her time trying to justify her position at the Magical Congress. Instead, she often came off like a nagging tattletale. Even when she and Newt were about to be put to death, its hard to believe she had any magic at all. I mean, shes supposed to be law enforcement, too, and she just stood there and did nothing to help herself as they tried to drown her in a white sterile room with a chair hovering over a pool of water. Really? Some of the worst visual effects they could come up with in the magical world! Once again, no creativity.
- The interactions between Credence (Ezra Miller) and Colin Farrell (Graves) were disturbing. I understand Credence was so broken from the abuse of his adopted mother, but Graves made it more creepy the way he shadowed him in dark places and back alleys, even if it was for just an exchange of information.

Im only giving 2 stars because even though the human actors were awful, the magical creatures were endearing and hilarious at times. Even Newts quest to save and help them is one we can all learn from too.

I gave this movie a shot because of HP, but it simply didn't live up to expectations for me. There was no character development or depth. They just showed up and let loose on us to figure out. Sprinkling a few names tied to the HP universe (Hogwarts, Grindelwald, Albus Dumbledore) only helps as a foot in the door.

I know a lot of people loved this movie, including those with questionable 1 line reviews.

In spite of loyalty to HP, I really tried to like FBaWTFT because it stood alone, and was genuinely good-- but for me, it wasnt, so I couldnt. I think they are planning to make 4 more movies. I hope they do the next one rightpleeeease make it better!",1499904000,2,3493,4.3894899536321486

There was no motivation in the movie - the villain did nothing to warrant being a villain; the main character was a bumbling idiot with no tact or accountability; the female co-lead literally DID NOTHING and was rewarded for being a hero?? Nothing in this movie made sense and there were no relatable/loveable characters. I LOVED the Harry Potter series, but this was a disaster. Can't believe JK Rowling wrote this. AND IT WAS SO BORING.

 You were the only thing good in this film.  And the reason that I watched it.

 What a waste of your talent.

 I sat through this movie I think But it was so boring, and so hard to follow that I started drawing while my husband and I tried to watch it. The plot is absolutely horrible, the script is base and painful- One stupid joke after another, the characters are undeveloped and I didn't care about any of them.  Our field you were so  easy to entertain now? That you don't even have to put together a proper script anymore?

5936536,5,B005QI4U0W,"Fantastic! Our family has loved the Harry Potter books for years, but the films, while well-done, never quite matched the picture in my head of certain story elements.
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is not burdened by a lot of source material (beyond the ""textbook"") to muddy the waters. Just lovely to see an unexpected backstory that (eventually) ties into the Harry Potter series without having a predetermined image in my mind of the characters or how the plot was handled/interpreted by the film makers. Also adds depth to our understanding of the background in the main Harry Potter canon. Looking forward to revelations as the remaining adventures unfold in future films.
I've also found that this film is much easier to watch with those who aren't familiar with the Harry Potter series as it truly is a charming, stand alone story.",1499644800,3,848,4.895833333333333

Perhaps if I were blind or listening to an audio version I would have enjoyed it more, but seeing it in the movie version, I didn't like it because the narrator was annoying.  While the characters each had lines, I could clearly see that ""Jacob tilted his head,"" that Newt ""twisted and turned,"" and that other characters walked down the street, into buildings, etc.  Yes, the narrator told you ever little detail when the characters were not speaking.  I forced myself to watch the whole movie because it could have been a great movie, without the narrator.  If you can stand being told every move characters make, that the door opened, that the plaster fell from the wall, then buy the movie.

5936563,4,B005QI4U0W,"My favorite parts of the movie were about the beasts. Any scenes with their direct involvement were glorious and made the imagination run wild as they were given a ""physical"" form and ""facts"" about their habitats and lifestyles. And the romance between Jacob and Queenie was rather adorable! Jacob's ending was heartbreaking and beautiful and although I do approve of the cliffhanger, I would be more than happy to read a story about his future and how his past could affect it!

My only complaint and the reason for the 4/5 instead of 5/5 stars is the uncomfortably forced romance between Newt and Tina. Tina causes the major conflict at the end of the story by repeatedly persecuting Newt despite him wanting to do nothing but preserve the misunderstood and unfairly persecuted magical species and being his own special and sincerely awkward self. And somehow, despite it being more logical for him to hate her and never want to deal with her again, he somehow feels romantically inclined towards her! And despite her being a terrible person and causing so much havoc in such a short time span FOR HER OWN PERSONAL GAIN she somehow has the balls to feel the same way! If this happened over a longer time period it would have been far more believable than what they portrayed in the movie.",1499212800,,1290,4.733333333333333

The lead character is a British fellow, magically endowed, who comes to the U.S. in search of a fantastic creature (he collects them and all).

5936633,4,B005QI4U0W,"How do you make a Harry Potter film without Harry Potter in it?  Well this is the question that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has had to answer.

Set in a wizarding 1920s New York City, the story centers on two plot lines.

The first plot line is around Newt Scamander.  Newt is a scientist who has a resemblance to Doctor Who, as his strange and cunning outlook has the trademarks of the epic character. Newt is searching for unorthodox creatures. As he stuffs them into his suitcase which is an accident waiting to happen.  When his suitcase gets mixed up with one that belongs to the""No-Maj"" (non magical) Jacob, some of Newt's fantastic beasts escape and cause problems in New York.  This leads to a whole bunch of funny scenes.

The second plot line centers on the Magical Congress of the United States of America or (MACUSA) and their efforts to hide the magical world.  This brings us Percival Graves and his obsession with finding magical children who have suppressed their abilities through fear to the point where they become something known as an Obscurus, more or less a huge glob of black smoke. Now this part of the film is dark, and not as entertaining.

The casting for Fantastic Beasts was fantastic.  We loved Eddie Redmayne in the main role as Newt Scamander. He portrays perfectly the awkward and introverted character that prefers the company of animals rather than humans. Another great addition is Dan Fogler as the bumbling Jacob Kowalski, who is thrust into the magical world by chance.  The actor playing Percival Graves is certainly believable.

The biggest challenge we had going into this, is whether or not it will live up to the legend of Harry Potter. As someone who loved the series and was skeptical about Yates undertaking this effort, Id have to say he pulls it off.  See.. the movie is pretty good.  Comparisons are unavoidable but let's remember, magic or no magic, this is a spin-off, no Harry Potter in here!  For newcomers, this movie is a good way to enter the Wizarding World that you have missing so far!  It isn't Harry Potter - but we liked it.",1498435200,10,2100,4.650406504065041

From the moment she saw the trailer, she pegged Fantastic Beasts as being awful. Her prediction was true. The plot was overly convoluted. ***Spoilers***  There didn't need to be a bad guy, especially one that they never explaied how NS discovered who he was. There was no need for the Second Salemers or whatever they were called. There was no need for Jon Voight or his sons. The plot of the movie should have been simple: Newts Beasts Escape and he gets the help of a local 'Nomadge"" and others to help him track them down while the magical Congress of the USA is trying to capture and kill the beasts. It seems like JK did everything she could do in an attempt to tie it in with HP, but it just destroyed the movie.

5936654,2,B005QI4U0W,"SPOILERS:  For me there was only one interesting plotline here, and it was Credence's.  He was the only character I was interested in or felt anything for. Ezra Miller was the only interesting actor.  The entire movie could have been about children who were taken into that orphanage to have their magic literally beaten out of them, and it would have been a lot more interesting.  I was very disappointed that the magical community killed Credence.  It sucked and was such a cliched ending of his story to me: kill the misfit.  Usually, J.K. Rowling is more innovative than that. I did find myself wondering why Tom Riddle wasn't an obscurus, but then he wasn't suppressing his magical abilities even as a child.

Most of the movie was boring and way too long. The plot was minimal and frankly stupid.  The attempts at humor and relationships were flat.  For the most part, I think this was a waste of a story in the wizarding world. The slim Fantastic Beasts book was not enough to base a story on.",1498262400,,1000,4.573033707865169

5936671,5,B005QI4U0W,"""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a great movie, almost a prequel to the Harry Potter series.  It features Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, a zoologist of magical creatures, passing through 1920's New York City with a suitcase full of magic.  The suitcase accidentally gets swapped for that of a would-be baker, and mayhem ensues.

Newt will find himself up against the local ""Ministry of Magic"" and the local muggles anti-magic society.  He makes one friend out of the would-be baker, Jacob Kowalski, and another out of a local auror, Tina Goldstein.  The race to retrieve the missing beasts, however, will run smack into an ancient and unexpected evil, brining unwanted attention to an already desperate situation...

5936702,4,B005QI4U0W,"Let me be blunt--Kowalski and Queenie were the only reason this movie gets four stars. Had it not been for their appeal as individuals and their chemistry as a couple...ish duo, I'd be giving this a three, instead. Sure, Eddie Redmayne was engaging, and Katherine Waterston was satisfactory. But the real magic--pardon the pun--rested with the performances by Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler. These two absolutely made the movie. Fogler was endearing and funny. Sudol was nuanced and magnetic. The final scene between these two--no spoilers--was my favorite part of this whole film.

And therein, I think, lies something of a problem.

Because this was supposed to be a movie about Newt. Newt and his beasts. Newt, and his beasts, and his friends. All of them fighting some dark force, as it so often goes in the wizarding world. And while this movie undoubtedly contained every one of those elements...I didn't care, At least, not as much as I expected to care with a film set in the Harry Potter Universe. Newt felt like an afterthought forced into a starring role. His animals played a very limited role in the climax of the story, despite being the stars of the title. And whole plotline surrounding the darkness they found themselves up against struck me as needlessly convoluted. In the end, I viewed this as less of a harrowing adventure film detailing the rise of Newt Scamander than a platform for enjoying the chemistry between a muggle named Kowalski and a witch named Queenie.

All in all, this film felt a little forced, largely unfocused, and--had it not been for the supporting cast--maybe unforgettable. But luckily, it has Kowalski and Queenie. So if you've got the money to spare, give it a shot for them. Or just Redbox it.",1497916800,,1738,4.825503355704698

5936737,5,B005QI4U0W,"I feel I need to preface this review by saying that, while I enjoy the Harry Potter books (I'm not a rabid fan but found them to be an entertaining read with a fascinating world within their pages), I've never been a big fan of the films.  Call me a book purist, but whenever I watch a film based on a book I can't help but nitpick it to death, complaining about what has been changed from page to screen and what was left out until people want to smack me into silence.  So my first thought when I heard about the ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" film was ""how on Earth are they going to turn such a slim little volume about the creatures of the Harry Potter books into a full-length movie?""  But I finally gave in to curiosity and had a look.  If nothing else, then perhaps a wholly original story set in the Harry Potter world would sit better with me than one cribbed right from the books.

""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" turned out to be a great movie, easily the best of the Harry Potter films to date, and it not only serves as a nice prequel for the series as a whole but shows us how wizards live outside of England, and gives us new insights into the wizarding-world culture.

""Fantastic Beasts"" follows Newt Scamander, a British wizard arriving in 1920s New York City on an important errand.  Newt has a fascination with magical creatures, and even carries an enchanted briefcase that serves as a gateway to a ""pocket world"" full of them... which results in mayhem when he accidentally switches suitcases with Jacob, an ordinary human who just wants to find the funding to open his own bakery.  When Jacob accidentally releases some of Newt's creatures into New York City's non-magical populace, Newt sets off on a quest to hunt them down... a quest that has him running afoul of a former Auror named Tina, who believes one of Newt's creatures is responsible for wreaking magical havoc throughout the city.  What starts off as a quest to recover his creatures turns into a battle to save the wizards of the United States from being exposed -- and stop a fearsome creature from killing innocent humans and wizards alike -- before a corrupt wizard-government official can use the chaos to further his own agenda...

While this film shares some characters and concepts in common with the rest of the Harry Potter series, as a whole it's an original story.  And as a result, I enjoyed it much more than the rest of the Harry Potter films.  It was nice to be able to watch a film that played in the same universe without triggering my urge to nitpick it to death, and fascinating to have a film that explored stories outside the established books and films, as well as explored time periods and locations not covered by the books.  I loved seeing how the culture and government of the American wizarding world differed from the British, from the policies regarding Muggles (called No-Majs in the US) to even how American wizards tend to handle their wands.  One might expect a film based on a Harry Potter nature guide to be a ""documentary"" of sorts, but here they've managed to weave a compelling tale but still incorporate many of the creatures of the book inside (as well as add some new ones!)

The acting is well-done as well -- Eddie Redmayne is adorable as Newt Scamander.  We're given a whole new world of characters to get to know and love, and as much as Harry Potter fans love Harry, Ron, and Hermione, I loved the dynamics and character development we got with Newt, Jacob, Tina, and Queenie as well.  Also, there are some enjoyable cameos by Ron Perlman and Johnny Depp within this film, though I won't spoil who they play...

The special effects are spectacular, preserving the enchantment and wonder of the magic of Harry Potter without breaking the audiences suspension of disbelief.  The creatures themselves are fantastically rendered, and look believable and well-designed enough to not look goofy to the audience.  The entire look of the film evokes its time period and location but still pleases the eye with some fascinating locations and designs.

Probably the best Harry Potter films to date, this is a must-see if you're a fan of the series, and still an enjoyable adventure if you're only a casual fan or even if you're unfamiliar with the books (some familiarity with the series does help, but isn't entirely necessary).  I have high hopes for the sequel, and hope to continue to see more of these characters.",1497657600,,4462,4.607323232323233

For die hard Potterheads, this movie is a must see as your Harry Potter knowledge may give you a hint at some of the things to come.

5936789,5,B005QI4U0W,"**This review is for the version I purchased; the one that looks like the photo I included**

The discs appear to be region-free. They're a UK/Ireland release, but they play perfectly fine on my North American Xbox One console, and I see no mention of region anywhere on the box. You get a Blu Ray disc for each film and a Blu Ray disc for each part of a ""making of"" documentary for the series. I haven't watched these yet, but they're there if that's your thing. The packaging itself isn't super high quality- just shiny cardboard sleeve/envelope things, but I don't care so much about that. If you have kids who are rough with disc packaging, just be aware of this.

Now, as for the digital copy. This is a UK/Ireland release and the code will only work in those regions. HOWEVER, if you email WB's digital copy support ( wbdigitalcopysupport@warnerbros.com ) they will open a support ticket with Flixster for you. If you send Flixster a photo of the Blu Ray case (showing the UV logo,) and a copy of your receipt, they will add the digital copies to your account. It took a couple days for them to reply to me, but they've been added successfully. To be clear, I live in the US.

Overall, this is an amazing price for what you get (around $45 when I bought it) especially for this series (always expensive, likely will never be available for streaming via Netflix etc.) If you're willing to put in a little legwork for the digital copies, it's worth it for sure. The discs are good quality as well. It's great watching these films in Blu Ray level HD.",1497139200,22,1554,4.464788732394366

5936792,5,B005QI4U0W,"I ordered the 16 Blu-ray disc set which is supposed to include a redemption code for the UV version earlier this week and received the set on Friday. As I anticipated based on the editorial comments and other customer reviews and comments on this item, the sheet with the redemption code indicated that it was only valid in the U.K. I then sent an email to wbdigitalcopysupport@warnerbros.com, as suggested by another customer, asking if it was possible to get a code valid in the US, as the official item description doesn't make clear that the code will only be for the U.K. I received a response from Flixster Video (uvsupport@warnerbros.com, so I think you could just send your email to that address) indicating that they would be happy to add the video to my collection if I sent them a photocopy of my sales receipt (I sent a PDF of my Amazon order that I downloaded directly from Amazon) and a photo of the redemption insert that came with the set. Prior to sending the email, I didn't have a Flixster account nor did I have a UV account. Flixster must have started an account for me, and after I sent the requested information they sent me an email saying I didn't have a UV account linked to my Flixster account. I had to reset my password in order to access the Flixster account, and then I set up a UV account using the instructions they provided. Once I did that, I sent them an email indicating that I now had a UV account linked to my Flixster account, and an hour or two later I received an email telling me that they had added the UV set to my collection! I verified that it was there, and also linked my Vudu account to my UV account, and have also verified that I can watch the set via Vudu on my Roku player.

I have yet to watch any of the set, since I just got it, but I can certainly say that the Flixster/Warner Bros. folks were fantastic in assisting me in getting access to the UV version. The 16-disc set comes in beautiful yet compact packaging, and I'm confident that I'll enjoy it thoroughly!",1497139200,15,2021,4.375

5936799,4,B005QI4U0W,Interesting story. I realize this is only part of the Harry Potter world and not directly related to Harry. It took a while to figure out what was going on. Nice to have other movies related to Harry's worl.,1497139200,,207,4.333333333333333

5936803,4,B005QI4U0W,"I'm going to start this review with a confession: I don't really care for the Harry Potter series. ""But you're giving this movie 4 stars...do you mean you prefer the books?"" No. Never got into the books, sat through all the movies for the sake of my significant other, but never got any real enjoyment out of the series as a whole. I used to joke, saying ""now if they did a story about Hagrid, I could get into that"".  Well, that loveable half-giant isn't here, but the magical creatures that he has such a passion for are, and Newt is a darn likeable character, too. The movie has an accessible story that is entertaining for kids and adults, is full of charming characters you quickly grow to have a genuine interest in, the setting being changed from England to America allows for explanation of staples of the world being explained to newcomers without feeling like it's taking down to long-time fans, there was  enough action to keep interest without drowning out characterization, and the CG animation for the creatures gave them personality. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I look forward to its sequels.",1497139200,7,1116,4.717948717948718

5936806,5,B005QI4U0W,"Haters gonna hate, don't let the bad reviews stop you from watching this, or influence you. This is a good movie, I've seen the other HP movies and they are awesome as well.

5936811,5,B005QI4U0W,This is a great movie that will leave you feeling lighthearted and hopeful.  It is a must watch for any Harry Potter fan.  Follow the quirky but lovable character Newt Scamander on his quest to save New York.  This flawlessly ties into the Harry Potter universe and provides a new point of view into the wizarding world as the story unfolds in America.

5936819,4,B005QI4U0W,J. K. Rowling has done it again.  This book goes beyond Harry Potter with another new and sort of interesting character.  I had a little complaint about the main character because he seemed to mumble all the time and lacked the energy someone like him should have.  I would recommend this film.  It was mostly fun to watch for the whole family.,1496966400,,344,4.5

this terrible film. The entire vibe of this movie was just gross. Katherine Waterston has to be one of the worst, most unappealing actresses on the planet. Maybe a different actress in her role would have helped but just yuck to this entire movie.",1496966400,,436,4.602564102564102

Hated all the dark/night scenes, too hard to see. Lots of CGI if you like that, but far too long for our taste as it rambled at the end. Plot was disjointed and confusing - a child the bad guy is looking for...but why, exactly? Chasing of beasts entertaining  and at times charming, esp the 'zoo' aspect of it in the wizard's bag. The 'dark energy' at the end didn't fit with rest of plot to me; would rather have had a major plot point with the actual BEASTS. Overall rating is ""meh"" - could've skipped it.

He doesn't look people in the eyes and is socially awkward. I liked that him being autistic wasn't inherently bad, in fact this movie showed it as a great quality. I hope in the sequels he is still coded with autism. It's rare to see a hero with autism that isn't some super genius or just very cold and mean.

I found the ""hero"" to be underwhelming and I saw the good-guy-is-actually-the-bad-guy twist coming half way into the movie.

Too many ""main characters"". Poor script, probably poor editing. Felt no connection to any character. Felt no character development whatsoever... except when characters changed opinions about others it happened suddenly, like one minute they thought another character was bad, then very suddenly they changed their mind with little evidence how they got from A to B.",1496102400,3,763,5.47457627118644

5937019,5,B005QI4U0W,"I love that this movie really has nothing to do with the Harry Potter series, besides the occasional mentions of Grindelwald. We all saw what they did when they tried to expand the Harry Potter movie into a play, and they murdered it (not in a good way, if that's not clear). This is good, it's fresh and fun and cool and visually stunning....a good antidote for those of us who still cling on to our Harry Potter nostalgia.

This is quite a dark movie, not really for young kids as with the later Harry Potter films. Do not be deceived by the cute creatures and light-heated trailers. I like that about the franchise though, that it's this magical world and it's so wonderful but so dark. I loved their take on the American wizarding world in this movie, very interesting. I would absolutely love to see the American wizarding school and the other countries as well, this is definitely something I hope they continue developing. I didn't know who most of the actors were besides Colin Farrell, but I loved all of them. This is a very cohesive movie with a script that makes sense, I wish that darn Harry Potter play was developed by these people instead.",1495670400,,1155,4.526315789473684

5937027,5,B005QI4U0W,"Wonderful movie and fine addition to the Harry Potter franchise. I think there's real opportunity to show the magical world here when the real world was still developing. The 1920s-1940s were a very formative period for our current world. No TVs, few cars, all news was done via newspaper or radio... it's a completely different setting than Harry Potter was. A lot of great and terrible things occurred during this time period that transformed the world forever. It is interesting to see the magical community operating during that time period, and changing along with it. It will be interesting to see how it plays out, especially if the next movies start to incorporate the depression and the second world war.",1495670400,,713,4.95

5937064,5,B005QI4U0W,"If you are a fan of the Potter world then you will likely love this new and slightly different dip into that world that you want to know more about. If, on the other hand, you thought Harry and crew was bit not as amazing as your friends said then you won't like this one. I am in the first group, I thought there was too little of the world with only seven books and I look forward to many more forays into the world my Rowling has created.
Not having a book to judge the content on was probably a plus for this, there are no preconceived notions of the characters going into this which benefits most of them. The American wizards are a bit to worried about being cautious but at the same time a bit more creepy than the old English variety.
I wasn't as taken with the main character as I was some of the supporting characters, they saved the show in my opinion. The baker-want-to-be muggle (I'm not using No-mage as that is dumb) is there for comic relief and a great character that gets better as the movie progresses. The American gal assigned to his ""case"" is a much weaker character than her flighty sister who steals many of the scenes she is in.
The assortment of pets are as fun as they are distracting and for the most part poorly used.
I realize that I have used way more negative words than I meant to but I am such a large fan of the movies that I have become critical but I don't think my admiration for the world and the stories could be tainted in a way I wouldn't love it.",1495497600,8,1489,4.155709342560554
5937065,4,B005QI4U0W,"Fun movie!  I very much enjoyed getting back into the Harry Potter world with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.  The beasts were so fun to see, especially the niffler, and for me, Jacob and Queenie stole the show.  I didn't realize that the actress who plays Queenie is the lead singer from A Fine Frenzy!  That was a fun little fact to find out.

Some parts were a little slow for me, especially the scenes with Credence, but I loved the movie and am excited for the next ones.

The characters are delightful, Eddie Redmayne played his role exceptionally well, I was equally delighted with Katherine Watersons as Porpetina, however Alison Sudol was incredibly sexy as Queenie Goldstein, especially with Red hair, wow, what a knock out, Colin Farrell was exceptional as always and Johnny Depp'd role as the central bad guy was so short, yet did all it needed to do.

5937120,1,B005QI4U0W,"Yeah no Harry Potter and none of ANY of the Harry Potter's characters's charm or level of empathy with these new characters.  I am surprised J.K. Rowling wrote a book & movie so devoid of not caring in the least or sympathizing with any of these annoying characters nor what happens to them.  Eddie Redmayne, a very capable actor, plays Newt (shades of Aliens!) Scamander as incredibly & unnecessarily stupid and it doesn't work.

None of the characters have a feeling they are attempting to control their destinies, unlike Harry Potter, but rather are victims of it.  I was highly disappointed by the lack of intelligence here, opting for excessively silly instead.  Visual Effects alone as well do not a movie make.  This movie is for the Harry Potter desperate looking for more magic but ultimately finding little.  Next time Jo give us characters we can care about.  We know you can do it.",1495238400,,893,4.753246753246753

5937173,4,B005QI4U0W,Love the movie but find it odd that the only way to get it to play in 3D is by using the 2D to 3D upscaling method. For some reason this movie does not appear to have a true 3D disc even though it claims to be one. This may be an issue with my 3D player but I had the same issue with both a Samsung BluRay and PS4. I will not mark it down as I love the movie and it does provide 3D but thought it is worth mentioning in case anyone else is having this issue.,1494892800,,458,3.59

5937191,3,B005QI4U0W,"Potter geeks (and I'll admit to being one as much as anyone who discovered the books as an adult might be) will love this as an extension of the franchise, but it may be incomprehensible to anyone new to the wizarding world. It's a fun romp, relentlessly internally referential, and interesting in its translation of the Potter universe into a period piece of early 20th century American cliches.
But much of the movie plays to the Pottermore faithful, and I can't imagine anyone else discovering this movie and getting hooked on the story line. (Well, peripheral movies seem to work for Star Wars, so who am I to quibble? ) But I did hope that this movie would introduce characters I could love as much as the Hogwarts crew. At least for me, I miss the kids and the endearingly quirky, thoughtful or tragic adults who surrounded Harry. Here, the characters just seem awkward and a little bit lost. Still I know true Potter fans will appreciate it for what it is--more wizards!",1494892800,2,977,4.6531791907514455

It absolutely did, it's amazing, I love the characters, and it was quite funny. I hope that the future movies in the series follows Newt, Jacob, Queenie, and Tina. I don't care for the Grindlewald and Dumbledore focus as many think the new ones will be. I want to know more about these wonderful characters they just introduced.",1494633600,,472,4.436781609195402

In this case though I found myself ""leaving the movie"" and questioning--how did they get Redmayne to walk like that, was it something attached to his leg or ...Anyway, bad sign.

5937323,5,B005QI4U0W,"Everyone loves VR, and everyone says 3D was a stupid fad that never took off. Maybe that's true, and maybe that's because studios didn't produce the right kind of effects in most movies. I'm not a huge Potter fan (my wife is, so I bought this for her - and then she made me watch it) but I did listen to the books on Audible, and could not get into any of the movies. Perhaps because I'm doing this as an adult, and alongside reading the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. This movie, though, was good-hearted fun. Easy twist to see through regarding the Big Bad, but it was a nice movie and the 3D effects on our home TV were excellent. Any Potter fan will love it.",1494374400,3,666,4.170542635658915

5937331,5,B005QI4U0W,"This is such a great movie! The casting in the movie was phenomenal, and I particularly enjoyed Eddie Redmayne as Newt. The way he would sometimes look at the other characters out of the corner of his eye; this was just spot on with the character to me. This story has a great plot as well, and surprisingly had me laughing at times. Great ending, definitely leaves it open for a squeal. If you like Harry Potter, you won't be disappointed.",1494288000,,440,4.444444444444445

5937342,3,B005QI4U0W,"Not as good as the original Harry Potter books, but ok for a Sunday afternoon watch. There was something missing, it felt that the movie  was made just to make American audiences happy that there is a school for the magical community here too.",1494201600,,243,4.5227272727272725

5937346,5,B005QI4U0W,"My 14 year old daughter was thrilled to get this for her bday. The price is right and with Prime it was here fast. We don't have a Blu Ray player right now, but Amazon makes this so economical we could get the 'best' version at a great price.",1494201600,,242,3.9591836734693877
5937347,2,B005QI4U0W,The movie was terribly long with hardly any action nor suspense until close to the end of the movie. There was a disconnect and lack of chemistry from the characters. There are lots of amazing talents in the movie but just lack character development for the audience to feel a connection with characters. Without that it is hard the audience for feel emotions along with the characters.,1494201600,,386,4.776119402985074
5937348,5,B005QI4U0W,Love it. I  watch it at least once a week. Very well done. Goes great with The Harry Potter movies.,1494201600,,99,3.95
5937349,4,B005QI4U0W,"I'm a sucker for anything related to Harry Potter, I got each one of the books as they came out when I was a kid. So, of course I had to watch this film. I enjoyed it, but mostly because it expanded on the Harry Potter universe. If it weren't tied to that, I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it as much. Everything about the plot felt predictable, nothing in the story felt new or unique, although there definitely points that had me smiling. I mostly liked seeing the American wizarding world and the graphics were great.",1494201600,,521,4.326530612244898

5937351,5,B005QI4U0W,My kids are old enough to get some of the lessons to be learned from this movie besides just enjoying the beautifully created beasts and very creative storyline. I have loved all the Harry Potter series and am very pleased with this one.,1494201600,,237,4.534883720930233
5937352,5,B005QI4U0W,As a Harry Potter fan of course I needed to see this flic. I was pleasantly surprised. No Harry mentioned as the plot was before Harry. The flic had excellent special effects and the acting was great. I found it amusing and entertaining. A fun flic to sit down with the family on a Friday night.,1494201600,,295,4.285714285714286

5937357,2,B005QI4U0W,"oh, I mean, magical creatures. The good vs. evil spirit of the Harry Potter series sinks to a political-social level and loses its engaging personal power and timeless magic. The characters are such stereotypes, it's impossible to really care about them, and what happens to them, because they come off as psychiatric case studies as opposed to living breathing souls. A really dark movie, and not just visually. Depressing, really, despite the occasional laughs by creatures that weren't really all that cute or endearing. At this point, I have to ask myself, what's the point? This felt like it was all happening in JK Rowling's head more than her heart and soul and did not feel real, and, in this case, I'm glad it isn't.",1494115200,,725,4.808
5937358,2,B005QI4U0W,"I love the world of Harry Potter and Rowling came up with some pretty fantastic magical animals - unfortunately these stellar creatures were not enough to carry the whole story. The story plot was a little thin and quite frankly a little too macabre for my liking. I would have enjoyed the plot if it was just about the young gent rounding up his suitcase of magical beasts, the sub-plot of the dark force was just too odd and gloomy. Not a feel good movie. I enjoy escapism, but to lovely magical places, not morbid. Waited a long time for this movie and was sorely disappointed. Don't waste your money.",1494115200,,604,4.5
5937359,5,B005QI4U0W,"I loved this movie, all the fantastic beasts were amazing and I like how Newt handles them, a lot like Hagrid thinking they aren't dangerous.  The nifflers were great, hold them upside down and shake and watch all the shiny stuff fall out.  Anyone else notice the Deathly Hallows pendant left behind, wonder if it is the one Luna Lovegood's father wears to the wedding.",1494115200,,369,4.661538461538462

5937363,4,B005QI4U0W,Was quite different from the other Harry Potter movies. So if you do not like Harry Potter but like magical type movies. May want to try this movie.,1494115200,,148,4.321428571428571
5937364,5,B005QI4U0W,We loved the movie! It was awesome! We will watch it over and over again. My family recommends the movie to everyone that enjoys magic!,1494115200,,135,4.44
5937365,1,B005QI4U0W,Nope. Falls short of the rest of the Harry Potter series. I was bored after the first 15 minutes. ,1494115200,2,98,4.157894736842105
5937366,5,B005QI4U0W,"I love this movie and has become a new favorite.  I enjoyed all the Harry Potter but this took it to the next level.  Lots of action to keep you focused, the creativity is amazing, and it is just fun to watch.",1494115200,,209,3.9523809523809526
5937367,5,B005QI4U0W,"I'm a fan of the Harry Potter movies and books so, of course I wanted to see this one but I waited until it came out for rent. What can I say I loved this movie. The characters were great and the story was interesting. I also loved the idea of seeing more of the magical beasts from Harry Potter and getting more of a background on the Harry Potter world.

A great movie for all ages. It really was worth the rental price.",1494028800,,422,4.023809523809524
5937368,2,B005QI4U0W,No recognizable plot. Mumbled dialogues.  Very difficult to give my full attention after about 10 minutes. Just seems to rely on special effects.,1494028800,2,145,5.304347826086956

5937374,5,B005QI4U0W,"Are you a seeker? I'm more of a chaser.

And the first Quiddich joke soars past most of the audience.
Just as the appearance of the Deathly Hallows symbol gives away who Gellert Grindelwald is in a flash.

There is SO much that appears to be written just for insiders and long time fans.
Oh, it's a great story for the muggles, but wizarding folk will GET it.",1494028800,5,359,4.264705882352941
5937375,4,B005QI4U0W,"This was a great family movie, but not all of it was understandable. The main character was fun and lovable. There was an amusing romance, and the scene at the end is hilarious. But though we have a bunch of ""fantastic beasts,""  it doesn't have the same creativity or wildness of the world of Harry Potter. This does not take place at Hogwarts, but in the USA. It's in the 1920s-1930s, and I like the setting, with all the clothes and cars and carriages, but it's always raining and dreary. There was one just plain weird scene where you're completely lost. The only creative things I saw were fantastic beasts and the suitcase. I love how this is linked to the book Harry is supposed to get. The movie was great, but if only it would have not had that scene, had more whimsical-ness, and was more clear.",1494028800,,804,4.4324324324324325

5937377,5,B005QI4U0W,This movie had some of the best graphics that I have ever seen. I loved it on the big screen and therefore felt that I had to have it as part of my private library. Loved Harry Potter so a series of prequels is a must.,1493942400,,218,3.760869565217391
5937378,5,B005QI4U0W,A very good movie.  Seems like it continued from Harry potter movie. Everyone in my family enjoyed this movie a lot,1493942400,,115,4.476190476190476
5937379,5,B005QI4U0W,"A truly wonderful story, populated with adult wizards (spells work first time, no backfiring wands, no obvious effort in doing all this). Most of the characters are people I would like to know. Plus fantastical beasts, many of whom seem to have populated our dreams as children. Wonderful acting, too. I've seen it 4 times now, mostly showing it to friends. Always find new things, or have a different take on characters and events.",1493942400,,432,4.851351351351352
5937380,3,B005QI4U0W,"This is not a children's movie. It is very dark - a repressive, fascist wizarding world as if Mussolini was running it or possibly Sen. Joe McCarthy, complete with thugs in leather coats, carrying wands like guns and executions for minor infractions of the secrecy rules. It was OK, but more like the later Harry Potter books, which I felt were too upsetting for children who loved the first one, when Harry was a little boy. There aren't many actual children in this movie. It's more about grownups gone astray and those who oppose them. Also, it was filmed very darkly. Dark streets, dark rooms, pasty-faced people. Not recommended for small children in my view.",1493942400,2,664,4.782608695652174

5937394,3,B005QI4U0W,"I am still undecided on this film after watching it twice but I think it is setting up the background for the films to come. It attempts to fill in the Wizadry world of the 1930s when the magical world had to deal with racism, paranoia and also has an underlying theme of protection of magical creatures. Give it a chance by watching it twice and then decide. I had already read the script which helped. Overall acting is good.",1493856000,2,427,4.35

It was still had it's fun magical moments, and adult humor which we appreciated, however so, it felt like two very different stories mashed into one.

5937400,5,B005QI4U0W,"I never really fell into the fandom or the hype of the Harry Potter books/movies, so I was a bit hesitant to check out Fantastic Beasts but being it had completely different characters, in a completely new location I thought I'd give it a go.  I quite liked it, the beasts are the highlight of the film, they are as the title suggest fantastic looking creatures, the plot which to be frank is a pretty basic one, certainly takes a backstory to we the viewer seeing these really cool creatures on the screen.  I actually got the most enjoyment amongst all the human/wizard characters from the socially awkward obese guy who wanted a bank loan to start a bakery.  I think he carried the film more so than the rest of the supporting cast.  I found the police woman or whatever she was to be quite weak and uninteresting.  Newt the main character, the author of the book titled the same name as this movie in the Harry Potter timeline, was good but you can't help but think you've seen his character a million times before in countless movies. But the movie is basically him collecting the beasts he smuggled through US customs that escaped his briefcase so it does fit.

At times though you couldn't help but compare what was happening on the screen to other movies, such as Ghostbusters, with the trap from that movie simply being replaced by a briefcase. The Men In Black memory wiping for humans. The Emperor with the electricity flowing from his hands in Return of the Jedi scene hurting Luke was looking like it was going to happen in this film too, I was just wondering who was going to be Vader and pick the villain guy up over his head. This definitely isn't a fresh new ideas film, but I did like it.  Four and a half stars.",1493856000,,1730,4.438485804416404

Some of my friends criticize the plot.  I think the message it sends is critical - basically - don't abuse kids, cherish them, cuz trauma is real and really bad for everybody involved as well as society at large.  But it sends that message whlie just being a fun fantasmagorical film, the 'scary parts' are only as scary as I remember the bad scenes from Lion King and such lol - just more vivid cuz it's not a cartoon.",1493856000,2,615,4.407079646017699

5937428,4,B005QI4U0W,Love the movie. Very disappointed in that I could not get the Ultraviolet to work so I could have it on my iPad and iPhone!  I even opened an account with Ultraviolet still didn't work. This is the second movie I have purchased with ZUltraviolet that wouldn't work.,1493769600,,265,4.520833333333333

5937432,4,B005QI4U0W,"Interesting prequel with highly likeable characters and fantastic CGI.  I was concerned at the beginning of the film that the creatures were all going to look like muffets, but the quality of the creatures seemed to improved the story progressed.  Maybe due to the creatures getting larger.... Some of the best scenes were when Newt went into the suitcase and you saw all the wonderful creatures he had.",1493683200,,403,4.911764705882353
5937433,1,B005QI4U0W,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is all special effects and no plot. Every moment of this movie is filled with special effects and it is so heavy laden that it's exhausting. Even the simple art of making tea was made with a spell. Yawn. There is so little plot that for 1/2 of the movie the protagonist is chasing a little thieving duckbilled gerbil around NYC. It gets old real fast. In the 2011 film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part ll, there is a white dragon that is breathtakingly illustrated and brought to life. Contrarily, the modeling of the beasts and insects in Fantastic Beasts are hastily rendered, looking more like Play-Doh in rainbow colors... and you thought Jar Jar Binks was annoying.",1493683200,3,720,4.677165354330708
5937434,5,B005QI4U0W,"I love this movie!! I'm a huge Harry Potter fan (books and movies), and I love Fantastic Beasts just as much in its own right. It comes at the wizarding world from a different direction than the HP books/movies in that rather than watching kids grow up and learn magic, this is the adult world of magic, where everyone is competent already, and where people can disapparate and apparate at will. It makes it very fun to watch. I also love how incredibly charming these characters are! The actors in this do an amazing job of conveying that! Can't wait for the next movie to come out!",1493683200,,583,4.457943925233645

That hang dog look of his and slump shouldered manner is just irritating. Dan Fogler played the best part in the movie.

5937452,2,B005QI4U0W,"Coming from all the Harry potter movies, I had high expectations.  Unfortunately this movie is a let down.
I assume it is mainly a fanfare movie for people who have read the associated book?

-SPOILERS: -
My main problem is that there is no character development, or at least any you care about.  When the movie ended I couldn't even remember the main characters name... You end up only having cared about the human and witch girl relationship.
-You only see the main bad guy do anything at the very beginning and end, like he's just a side thing.
-The entire movie was them trying to collect the ""beasts"" he brought with him and accidentally released, while feeling like the movies only goal was to try and impress you with the animals themselves... But all the ""Animals"" they had to collect just felt like filler and not really interesting or important.

In the end I came out of it feeling like the movies only purpose was to show off a bunch of ""cool animals"" that people who read the book might want to see animated.  Everything else about it was lackluster.",1493683200,,1063,4.544502617801047

5937537,4,B005QI4U0W,"I didn't realize that this was related to the Harry Potter world until I started watching this.  Although I wouldnt say that I am a huge HP fan, I did enjoy watching most of the movies of that series, especially after the first couple of movies.  So, if you are a HP fan, then this is a movie you will enjoy but I think that even if you are not a HP fan, I think this is an enjoyable fantasy movie.

As the title of the movie says, the special effects and CGI are pretty fantastic.  There are some pretty amazing CGI details even down the smallest background piece or fantastic creature.

The acting for the most part is good, although there are a few scenes where you can tell the actors are a little confused with the green screen and the scenes look a bit strange due to their reactions but for the most part, I found it a minor issue.  The stars of the movie, to me, are the trouble making beasts, especially the smaller ones.

The story is pretty good and something different from the typical HP type of story, although there are times the plot seems to want to go in a variety of directions at once.  There are a few moments that try to lighten the mood as the movie gets a bit dark at times.  Sometimes those light moments are cute and sometimes they are rather bland and silly.  The movie is a bit long at 2 hours and 15 minutes.  I do think they stretched the ending out a bit and it could have been cut a bit shorter.  Of course, like most movies that are popular these days, they are setting up for a sequel.

Overall, a decent HP spinoff that both HP fans and fantasy fans, like I am, will enjoy.

Even though I miss seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione...I'm sure I will come to love the characters in this series. It's awesome that they intend to make 6 movies in this new franchise and I can't wait until they release the next one.

5937634,2,B005QI4U0W,"I honestly don't understand all the positive reviews.  Okay, some of the special effects were cool.  But the best part of the movie was the character of Jacob Kowalski.  There was no background whatsoever about the other characters.  Eddie Redmayne was amazing as Stephen Hawking, but he just didn't do well in this movie.  He always has this somewhat dumbfounded look on his face and this awkward smile, even when something horrible is happening.  I'm not sure if that's how he talks in real life or what.  But it was annoying and creepy.  You just wanted to slap him in order for him to show some anger or any other emotion whatsoever!  I think people want to like this because it's from JK Rowling, but if anyone else wrote this, I think people would be more negative.  Just because it has her name stamped on it doesn't mean it's good. Collin Farrell was just okay, he's less annoying to watch than Eddie, but the cameo at the end with Johnny Depp didn't add anything to the movie. You could have paid a random actor a lot less money to do a better job for 10 seconds of acting.  Blah, definitely not worth all the hype. JK Rowling should make a GOOD movie about magic in America.  She could have elaborated on the school and shown us more.  Like Harry Potter but in America - this was not it!",1493078400,2,1297,4.399159663865547

5937656,5,B005QI4U0W,"Wow, such a well-made and enjoyable movie! I keep on marveling at the imagination and creativity of J.K. Rowling as the plot takes unexpected turns and the magical imagery and vocabulary from the Potter films (and books) expands. It strikes me as more grown up than the Potter films since it does not focus on the lives of children and teenagers. As an animal lover myself, I totally identify with Eddie Redmayne's character and his dedication to the safety of his creatures. The creation of these magical beasts by the writer and filmmakers is itself magical. What a delight.",1492992000,3,576,4.828282828282828

5937669,3,B005QI4U0W,"Sorry to say, i don't think this is particularly well written.  I am a complete Harry Potter nut so it was easy enough for me to figure out what was going on.  My husband thought it was inane.  Newt Scamander was well played, the visuals were okay, old New York scenes were good but the plot was just 'off'.  That business of hopping into the suitcase and finding living creatures and their habitats in an area the size of a small  state was too much for me.  Yes, I know Moody's trunk had seven layers and Hermione carried books, clothes and supplies in her evening bag.  Don't care, this went too far.  The neffler was a cute platypus type animal, rather endearing as it raided jewelry stores and the other creatures were interesting.  I just did not like to story because the story was not really there.  With the Potter movies, we had the books for explanation and enrichment.  There was very little development.  Gellert  Grynedwald (sp?) made an appearance.  The president of the New York, or maybe US wizards said, when he was finally  captured, that he would be securely locked away.  Well pardon me, but Potter fans know, Gryndewald must have escaped because Albus Dumbledore defeated him in combat in 1945.",1492992000,,1216,4.63849765258216

The actors were really terrible the the creatures where very unimaginative i.e., a duck billed platapus that steals shiny things. Maybe good for people under 14.  What a waste of time. Only good character was the fat guy from the Balls of Fury movie.  I did notice when they all walked into this big hall, there was a giant reversed (see sign of illuminati/satan pentagram on the floor. They walk from the back to the front and then, as the shot reverses towards the back of the hall, the pentagram, which should be right side up now in the shot, is once again inverted.

5937702,3,B005QI4U0W,"Part of the Potterworld franchise, I enjoyed this trip back in time to 1920's Gotham city like New York, to follow the adventures of Magizologist Newt Scamander and the origin's of the Hogwarts text book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.  The star of the movie is really all the fantastic magical creatures, contained in Newt Scamander's Narnia like suit case. The Occamys, Thunderbirds, Demiguises, the fabulous Swooping Evil, and the most adorable Nifflers and Boat Truckles let loose over New York. And it made a change from the original series to see a glimpse of the wizarding world in America. It is charming but has a dark Crucible like undertones with the Witch Hunters. All the performances were very good and the script said to be written by JK Rowling was excellent. Many people enjoyed the comic romance and chemistry of No-Mag Jacob, and Queenie -  it's the only thing I really didn't like in the movie. I just found their odd coupling, hot young sex bomb and a rather rotundly fat puggy faced middle aged baker, not at all believable. It's  was like pairing Brad Pitt with Kathy Burke!  But in all it had all the charm and entertainment of a Harry Potter movie without being one.",1492905600,,1200,4.7

5937746,5,B005QI4U0W,Not as exciting a the Harry Potter stories but very entertaining.,1492732800,,65,5.0
5937747,5,B005QI4U0W,"Totally, different feel than Harry Potter. Not dark, funny, cathartic, suspenseful and thrilling to watch. The depth of the characters was well developed in my opinion. It had all the creativity of JK Rowling and her imaginative spirit, in addition, the introduction of new characters and being set in The United States. Plus, a unique subtle critique of the United States puritanical views on witchcraft was cleverly woven into the story. Which was a stroke of literary genius.",1492732800,,478,5.141025641025641
5937748,1,B005QI4U0W,This appears to be another movie made because it could be rather than because it should be. Think of it as the Anti-Christ Harry Potter.,1492732800,2,136,4.48

5937752,5,B005QI4U0W,"I loved this. Eddie Redmayne is absolutely perfect for Newt Scamander. It is a take it or leave it movie. You can't be disappointed in this because there's legitimately no story/character framework to reference when you watch this. You literally are seeing this from the ground up as far as the story  creation goes. It's definitely different because its 1920s, American wizardry, Pre-Harry Potter magic and characters. You get brief glimpses of romance and comedy in this dark and dramatic movie. The niffler is probably one of my favorite comedic characters in this.

The acting is carried out superbly. I loved this that I pre-ordered it as soon as it was available.",1492646400,3,669,4.964285714285714
5937753,5,B005QI4U0W,I would have to rate this slightly above the Harry Potter series! I cannot express enough into words how much I loved this movie and how much I hope and pray they continue upon Newts adventures!,1492646400,,194,4.416666666666667
5937754,5,B005QI4U0W,I have watched this twice this week! Very very good.,1492646400,,52,4.3

5937756,5,B005QI4U0W,Very fun movie to watch.  Lots of action and special effects.  Even the plot was good.  Highly recommended.,1492646400,,107,4.833333333333333
5937757,5,B005QI4U0W,"It's 1926, the Jazz Age before the Great Depression and New York City is hopping in more ways than one. In Europe, Gellert Grindewald, a dark wizard still on the run, has spread terror with his attacks on Muggles. He wants to start a war between Muggles and magicians.

As in Europe, the NYC population of No-Majs (No-Magic, the American term for Muggles) have only suspicions that there are magicians among them. To keep it that way, the American wizarding community has strict laws, enforced by MACUSA, including a ban on magical beast ownership in the U.S.

Enter Newt Scamader. Literally. He disembarks a ship in New York Harbor with a small suitcase and it soon becomes apparent that he is not only holding magical beasts in his suitcase but those beasts are prone to escaping.

But is it Newt's fault that a horrific gray cloud is descending on NYC streets to kill people and destroy buildings? MACUSA thinks so. The truth is MUCH more interesting.

I think ""Magical Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a great addition to PotterWorld. The first time I watched it, I thought it was good though a little slow sometimes. The 2nd time, because I knew the story, I was able to pay more attention to detail and production values. Now I think it is a very good movie. In particular, it is a lot of fun to pay attention not just to the main action, but the background, and find hints of the Harry Potter world in the original films. One of those, incidentally, is NOT Leta Lestrange. We know the Lestrange last name of old, but Leta did not appear on the original family tree in ""The Order of the Phoenix.""

If you watch the movie on BluRay/DVD, you can have the options of audio in English Descriptive Video, French or Spanish. You can also watch with subtitles in English, French or Spanish.

I enjoyed the Special Features on the BluRay/DVD release. They have interviews, film clips and rehearsal clips with a total of some 32 people commenting. The only audio on the Special Features is English. But they have subtitles available in English, French, and 3 more languages which I'm not sure of because they are not shown in English letters.
....A...""Before Harry Potter: A New Era of Magic Begins"" (15 minutes) Alison Sudol (plays Queenie) says, ""Friendship is something that Jo [JK Rowling] does beautifully. It's always a very strong through-line in all of her stories.""
....B...""Characters: The Magizoologist, Goldstein Sisters, No-Maj Baker, New Salemers, and The Presidennt and the Auror"" (total 23 minutes) Hear from writers, crew and the cast. Eddie Redmayne (plays Newt) talks about developing his character, ""I went about it by meeting people from the zoologist world, meeting trackers. They would talk passionately about their techniques and their methods."" This was particularly helpful in the hilarious scenes with the Erumpent.
Dan Fogler talks about Jacob and Queenie, ""There are strict laws, especially in New York, that we're not allowed to be together, which also mirrors the racism of the time. It's really beautiful how J.K. parallels all of these cultural conundrums.""
Last, but not least, J.K. Rowling, ""This is the back story [of the Barbones] you don't learn in the movie."" Watch this bonus to find out.
....C...""Creatures: Meet the Fantastic Beasts, Bowtruckle, Demiguise, Erumpent, Niffler, Occamy and Thunderbird"" (total 20 minutes) This includes lots of interesting  shots with the puppeteers doing their own magic.
JK Rowling, ""You can make an invisibility cloak from the pelt of a Demiguise. Which is why they're hunted and endangered.""
....D...""Design: Shaping the World of Fantastic Creatures, New York City, MACUSA, Newt's Magical Case, The Shaw Banquet and The Blind Pig"" (total 32 minutes)
David Heyman (producer): ""We visited New York [City] and did a scout there. There is remarkably little of New Yok 1926 in New York today."" So they created it at Warner Brothers Leavesden back lot in 15 weeks. Most movies would only dream that they had enough money to do that.
David Watkins (special effects supervisor) shares great footage of how they filmed the Obscurus damage at the Shaw Banquet.
....E...""Deleted Scenes"" (total 14 minutes) There are 5 scenes. The character of Mildred was totally deleted and I think the film is better for it.

The funniest and most open-minded baker in the world: ""I don't think I'm dreaming. I don't got the brains to make this up.""

I'm looking forward to the next Newt Scamander installment. It sounds like there will be at least 3 movies total. For one thing, we'll learn more about the  best wizarding school in the U.S., Ilvermorny in Massachusetts. The houses are the Horned Serpent, Wampus, Thunderbird and Pukwudgie. Check out pottermore(dot)com for JK Rowling's story of the school.

5937785,3,B005QI4U0W,"JK Rowling's new Harry Potter world-extension isn't so much a prequel as it is a loose, distantly relevant novella. People wave wands and use familiar lingo. Footnotes from the wizarding world take flesh and form out in the wild and there's a bit of familiar name-dropping to keep us all invested. Eddie Redmayne takes top billing as the introverted naturalist with an extensive collection of traveling wildlife, but as the name implies, the beasts themselves are the real stars here. A live-action jaunt through the monster manual, it's an interesting, unusual turn if not a terribly fulfilling one. Many times, I felt like I was digging through the guts of an info-rich companion book and not a free-standing tale. There's the framework of a story, of course, but it's awfully dry, light fare and the real focus is quite clearly on establishing a deeper lore for the growth of the franchise. The effects work is strong, as it desperately needed to be, and I enjoyed the unexpected aesthetic of magical society at play in the roaring twenties, but there isn't a lot of meat on these bones. Disappointing, since the Potter films are brimming with precisely the kind of depth, warmth and rich, implied back-story that this is missing.",1492560000,,1233,4.904306220095694

I watched this with my friend and with my 78 year old grandmother whom also loved this movie. If you've seen all the Harry Potters and if you are like me and are a fan of magic and magical creatures oh this is an awesome movie. Also I enjoyed the length of the movie as well. I'll admit I watched this twice and it is likely that i'll be renting it again and watching it with another one of my family members. definitely a nice family movie.

There was not one character in this that I did not like at all. I loved Ezra Miller too, big fan. Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol and Colin Farrell all are terrific.

5937849,4,B005QI4U0W,"I'll offer a two-part review here.  First, a review of the movie itself and, second, a review of the 4K UHD disk.

The Movie - 3 Stars
A solid effort here, but I feel this will fall short of the expectations that many Harry Potter fans will place upon this film.  While certainly a solid effort, Fantastic Beasts doesn't quite have the magical feel (pun intended) of the original series. Despite fans' longing for Hogwarts and the original cast of characters, there is a genuine opportunity to create something new and exciting here, especially for younger viewers that didn't grow up with Harry Potter. Overall, I will say that the studio did an impressive job recreating 1920's New York in fantastic detail.  Costumes were excellent, characters seemed true to the period, and it was a nice change of pace from Harry's modern-day Britain.

Though paced a bit slow for the first third of the movie, the latter chapters certainly do not lack for action, and I think audiences will enjoy the familiar cadence leading up to the climax.  In comparison to the original Potter series, I suppose one could say that most of those films also spent a great deal of time in the first chapters building up to the rising action.  But this is where original Potter series shines, and where this film left me wanting more.  In the original films, the early chapters spent a great deal of time constructing the rich background and wondrous characters in illustrious detail.  A mere hour into the first film, we *loved* Harry, and even us adults that waited years in tacit denial before seeing the films found ourselves rooting for him along the way.  Very few films have the power to create a connection with young people, but also transport us adults back to childhood.  The original films did just that, and it was largely due to Rowling's masterful characterization.  Kids wanted to be Harry, and adults, regardless of childhood station, found ways to identify with Harry as well.

In Fantastic Beasts, however, I largely felt like an outside observer.  I was never quite drawn into the story, and I yearned for the rich background the original films consistently provided.  I also wanted to like the characters, I truly did.  The dialogue felt a bit flat and even awkward at times, and the characters felt 2-dimensional compared to Harry and friends.  And while by no means a short movie, it all kind of felt rushed.  I will say that the reveal at the end does have me somewhat excited for the second move, so I'll reserve final judgement until we see what the future of the series has to offer.

The Disk - 5 Stars
First, some specs on the setup:

Display: LG OLED65E6P
Source:  Oppo UDP-203
Pre/Pro: Emotiva UMC-1
Amp: Sony 80 Watts/Channel
Speakers: Polk Tsi in 5.1 Configuration with Polk PSW-505 Sub

I've viewed a number of 4K UHD movies at present, and all have been beautiful.  Fantastic Beasts is no exception. The colors of 1920's New York were, though intentionally muted at times, were stunning.  This was in contrast to the rich color of Newt's magical world and his beasts, which veritably leapt from the screen.  HDR implementation was solid as well.  Though I cannot comment on Atmos (yet), the audio in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 was rich and enveloping.

The VUDU UHD stream in Dolby Vision was nearly as vibrant as the UHD disk, and I think all but the most discerning videophiles will be pleased with the quality of the digital copy.",1492214400,2,3431,4.722689075630252

And, the characters were developed to the extent that the story demanded. They may be developed more if there are going to be sequels. We will see. The acting was ok too.

When you first enter the redemption code on the warner brothers site, do not select to redeem it with their app. Instead, click on the small link at the bottom that says something like ""redeem with other providers"". Once you click that, it will take you to the standard ultraviolet site where you can choose one of 3 providers to redeem with. I chose VUDU, and with that you'll get a 4K UHD copy with dolby atmos / dolby vision support.

Although, admittedly, I can't tell you for sure that none of the other providers offer the same thing, I just know that VUDU does because that's what I chose. It's a pleasant and unexpected surprise.",1492128000,4,786,4.458333333333333

I thought after the first 20minutes that the story would pick up. Nope. Not at all. I couldn't even understand Newts extremely quiet mumbling. I kept turning to my girlfriend and asking, ""what did he say??"" At least the whole time. Idk that annoyed me a lot. Overall this movie really sucked. Couldn't wait for it to be over.

From then on, he goes on a hunt to retrieve his missing beasts with a muggle named Jacob. The movie seemed to lack the charm that the Harry Potter movies had and also lacked in-depth characterization. By the end of the movie, you still didn't feel as if you truly knew the characters. The producers of this movie put more emphasis and effort on their digital work. There was a noticeable amount of effort put into the animation of the beasts, which I thought looked great. The costumes were very well done, which earned them an Oscar. In the end I left the movie pretty unsatisfied, probably since I had high expectations coming in.

A must watch for any Harry Potter fans, but it is a completely separate story in the same world. I liked that there were a lot of new faces in the cast, too.

My husband and I started watching this with her, expecting to only last the first half hour before we'd had enough.  I was very pleasantly surprised though.  My husband and I were engaged throughout the whole movie.  We really enjoyed it.  It's well written and interesting, with a powerful message.  My daughter loved it too.  It's tough to find a movie that is ""fun for the whole family"", and this one was great!  I highly recommend it",1491782400,,545,4.424242424242424
5937946,2,B005QI4U0W,To be honest I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I feel like everything in it just didn't work. The cast. The script. The CGI (although this could be b/c I watched it at home instead of a theater). Maybe wait on this one until it's free to watch?,1491782400,4,256,4.244897959183674

This movie takes place before Harry Potter which I think is awesome! I hope they keep the world alive with these movies. -- I really like this movie, the ending is okayish I think it could have been a little more classy like the HP evils that lay in its time. But the characters are great especially the main protagonist. The ""beasts"" are just phenomenal, they are so majestic and bizarre! I can't wait to see how saga unfolds inside the Harry Potter universe! Keep it up J.K. Rowling!",1491782400,,601,4.280701754385965

5937951,1,B005QI4U0W,"A total disappointment!  Couldn't even use the Harry Potter actors, who certainly would have brightened this film.  On that thought this movie was so dark that the producers seem to forget the viewers need to see the movie!  The movie was hard to follow and was boring in comparison to the first Harry Potter series.  The platupus monster breaking up the area was overdone to a cringe point.  So much destruction to a point of no point!  Logic in this movie was lacking!  If this follows the book, then the author needs to take more time in scrutinizing how the movie affects viewers.  I would normally, give the Potter (anything Potter) a five, but this is a total loser and there is something to be said about our money wasted and our life hours being wasted watching something that is an entertainment disappointment.  The best Potter movies made were the first two, after that all went downhill and this ranks the lowest!  Maybe ghost writers can breathe life into anymore of the Rollings productions if this is all we can expect.",1491782400,5,1034,4.662983425414365
5937952,5,B005QI4U0W,"Came in time in excellent condition. Seen the movie in theatres and had to own it. I just hope there will be a trilogy like the Potter movies. There is so much that can be done with the movie. The only thing I didn't like all too well was it took place in America which took away from the value of it being a fantasy, just my opinion.

5937954,5,B005QI4U0W,"I started to read the screenplay - which was released as a book, but really wasn't a ""book"" in the common meaning of one.  But I digress.

The special effects are pretty well done.  The costume design - the same.  The story connects with the Harry Potter books/movies - but it is NOT a Harry Potter story - it lays out some of the groundwork that we see in the HP stories.

So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.",1491782400,2,414,4.125
5937955,2,B005QI4U0W,"The disk set itself was decently packaged and all three delivery types worked fine. I suspect this is a movie where you have to have read the book in order to understand the movie. The plot is a mess, the characters are undeveloped, the big reveal at the end is anticlimactic because it isn't set up properly during the movie. I am an avid movie watcher and it was downright painful to wade through this one. I have to wonder if there is maybe another hour of this film that would cause it to make sense?",1491782400,2,504,4.260416666666667

5937961,2,B005QI4U0W,"This... should have been better. Fantastic beasts, 1920s New York, magic, a pending arcane war -- so much potential. And yet it was flat, with too little plot for its lengthy running time and far too little characterization and tenuous motivation. ""We have to find the missing animals so our villain doesn't blame them for the strange phenomena which have been going on for weeks before the animals' arrival.""

It's mostly a showcase for special effects, with long sequences dedicated purely to chasing beasts but not dealing with any story factors. A few obligatory references to the Harry Potter universe we already know is not enough to endear this film.",1491696000,,657,4.972727272727273

5937967,3,B005QI4U0W,"Excellent special effects and costuming, but as we surely know by now, special effects can't carry an entire movie.

Very few people I know of had ever even heard of it - too bad.
Well made, well acted - not some cheap stupid remake of a comic book or the zillionth part to something started 30 years ago.
I really enjoyed it  and am looking forward to part 2. Not sure how little ones would take to it - but it's a fun film and I am so very glad it's in my collection!

5938018,5,B005QI4U0W,"A great young adult movie. It leaves the character of Grimes unclear until near the end, so the suspense is excellent. Almost all of the characters are intent on doing the right thing -- they just don't know what that is. And the getting together of our 4 heros/heroines is very satisfying and not overly rushed. Realistic relationships are developing slowly, and it will be fun to find out how they turn out in a sequel. (I want to see those Appaloosa what-ya-macall-its.)
Another review also mentioned going back to see it again and following the trail of commentary. I hope to do that also.",1491523200,4,593,4.6571428571428575

There are subtle hints to larger issues in society, very much so in the JK Rowling fashion, some may come across as offensive to those who feel attacked by the largely biased view of the U.K. being more progressive.

It has a different feel from Harry Potter but not to much of a difference to where you can't tell they both take place in the same universe. Now I have read the 'Fantastic Beasts' book yet so I can't comment on that but I do plan on reading it soon! Overall I think this is a great fantasy film that can be enjoyed by fans of Harry Potter and those not familiar with the wizarding world of Harry Potter as well (if you haven't seen any of the potter films that's fine as it will not ruin this movie or confuse anyone ect). I am happy to now own this film so I can watch it as many times as I'd like (I've already watched it a few times since bringing it home not even a week ago, lol) I would recommend this film to all, Harry Potter fan or not you will defiantly enjoy this jem of a movie!

It could have been so much better.  The visuals are amazing, cgi incredible.  But I felt that there was something missing to this film,  it felt at times rushed, and in fact there was a part that I felt was left unresolved (I won't state which so I don't spoil the movie for those who have not watched it.)  Great for renting, not a keeper.  I am so happy we rented it first instead of buying the blu ray.  To be honest the main reason there is a problem with the plot is that they push so much on the protagonist part of the movie and build on the suspense, and at the last minute what would have been supposedly a super evil gets dealt with in seconds like a fly bothering a cow and getting tail whipped from the cow's rear end like nothing, and also leaves another character's growth and importance in limbo forgotten.

Eddie Redmayne is such a versatile actor and was really charming and fun in this film.  I also really enjoyed the mind reading witch.  Very cute and funny. The rest of the characters were pretty dull.  However, the story didn't seem to be developed very well and almost appeared as if Rowling wasn't sure where she wanted to go with it.  It is somewhat darker than the original series (although they got pretty dark at the end, too).  The magical creatures, except for the Griffen, were poorly done and disappointing.

So if you want this on your apple device, you can only do so by buying it again.

Additionally, though it may come as no surprise to some, but the blu-ray is encrypted so that you cannot view this on your PC without going out and buying a blu-ray media player, even if you have a blu-ray drive.

Why can't people write movies about the best of humanity without people torturing tormented souls and ruining everything? Clearly because that is too difficult. The best character was by far the niffler. And the niffler didn't even speak English! Or speak at all! Or even exist for most of the movie! This should really get 0 out of 5 stars. It essentially is the Eragon of the Harry Potter series. If this entire movie had been about the niffler taking all the shiny things in New York, it would maybe have been the best movie of 2016.

Having seen so many films in the format, I can confidently say that this is EASILY one of the best presentations out of my entire collection. Warner Brothers has really used the format to immerse you in the Wizarding World and make you feel like you're a part of all the action and adventure. If you've been looking for a great 3D disc to add to your collection, or have a 3D TV that you haven't quite enjoyed yet, this is a fantastic addition to your collection. My only complaint is that aside from some quick-moving newspaper headlines in the opening sequence, Grindelwald is never properly introduced - leaving anyone who hasn't read the books either recently or at all, in the dust. It's nothing a quick Google search can't fix, but I can see a lot of people feeling a bit lost by the end of the film and skipping any future sequels as a result.",1491091200,15,971,4.370165745856354

5938156,4,B005QI4U0W,"My expectations were very high when I heard about this movie because, despite my advanced age, I'm a J.K. Rowling fan.
In general, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" met those expectations. It is visually stunning, has some wonderful performances (especially notable, in my opinion, are Alison Sudol as ""Queenie"" and Dan Fogler as ""Jake Kowalski""), and a likable hero in Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne.) The story is well thought out and the CGI is nothing short of amazing.
Where the film didn't meet my expectations, however, was in the direction. I felt that director David Yates lost focus a few times. Some scenes seemed overly long, for example, while in a few others he apparently fell victim to the common Hollywood failing of trying to dazzle audiences with special effects rather than letting his actors tell the story. Rowling has the ability to create memorable characters and give them plenty of rich dialogue but there were occasions in this otherwise very fine film that Yates had his actors standing around gaping at the whiz bang CGI instead of moving the story forward.
That said, I still very much enjoyed this film, the first in what I hope will be at least a trilogy. As far as I'm concerned, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is worth every bit of 4.5 stars.",1491091200,,1305,4.778761061946903

The movie misleads you, if you are expecting loads of creatures jumping out of the suit case or running wild in the city and needed to be captured. Sorry its not here.
In fact our nameless hero or the captain of a nameless subject does no such adventure finding said creatures. So thats a fail
Meaningless and unimportant characters that have little to no plot development

The main characters are uninteresting and borderline unlikable. The fanciful CGI beasts are mildly artistic, but are gratuitously crow barred into the story. The plot jumps all over the place, with characters and plotlines introduced then abandoned for long parts of the movie. Carmen Ejogo, God bless her, just can't act.

5938216,4,B005QI4U0W,"J. K. Rowling has released a new story line in her famous and immersive series in the Harry Potter Universe.  Directed by Harry Potter veteran David Yates 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' features the adventures of Newt Scamander, who has traveled to New York City for unknown reasons.  Newt is played by Eddie Redmayne of 'Les Misrables fame as a lovable but wacky collector of magical beasts making his way through the unknown dangers of New York City.  Be advised, wacky hijinks await as this mesmerizing story unfolds.  Newt must control his magical beasts while avoiding the political ramifications of his mishaps in the new world and navigating the magical underground.  What awaits him on his quest full of conspiracy?  I highly recommend you discover the answer to these questions yourself.  I gave this four stars for the following reasons.  First, the product was shipped and arrived within 24 hours.  This was especially appreciated because my roommate, a crazy Harry Potter fan, was dying to see it.  Secondly, it arrived in perfect condition.  The cd case was in an artistically pleasing cover.  The shrink wrap was hard to remove, but a simple kitchen knife allowed it to be removed without damaging the insert casing.  The Blu Ray itself was immaculate.  The movie did not skip once.  Thirdly, I truly enjoyed watching this movie.  It was a well written story with a great plot line.  The actors perform with incredible talent.  The only reason it didn't get five stars is because I thought it lacked good transitions between scenes.  I would definitely recommend this movie.  The greatest compliment I believe a movie can get is if you would re-watch it.  I am going to enjoy this movie many times and am glad that I own it.",1490832000,3,1749,4.821548821548822

The special effects do intrigue the audience, but it makes the whole movie just a big CG adventure with very little substance.

I normally do not get as much enjoyment from 3D movies as most people due to vision issues, but this one was incredible! I found myself laughing out loud as the creatures seemed to be touchable and right in front of my face. The move has some light-hearted context early on as you watch one particular creature get into mischief and then when one thinks a human is a potential mate. Then of course the drama develops and the ending was a surprise for me. I suppose I should have guessed where it was going but I hadn't a clue until the end.
J K Rowling did a wonderful job with this story. Harry Potter it isn't, but then it isn't intended to be.

5938236,2,B005QI4U0W,"SPOILERS!! I enjoyed all the Harry Potter movies. I'm not a die-hard fan of the entire thing (I've seen them all once or twice, not 20 times, haven't read the books) but it's (Harry Potter) good entertainment. Based on that, and my mother enjoying this and wanting me to see ""for discussion"", I watched it - kind of - tonight. I was bored from the beginning. First off, why would a wizard need to take a trans-Atlantic ocean liner? Shouldn't they just be able to pop over? Second off, if this doofus of a wizard is too stupid to transport his animals in an inescapable suitcase, maybe he shouldn't be an animal caretaker. And honestly - they used the ""oops, we have the exact same suitcase and got them mixed up"" ploy? YAWN. Once his platypus or whatever, escaped - and Eddie couldn't just use his wand to snag him, I dozed off because I simply didn't care. When 1/2 the movie was over and he had his zoo under control, we could FINALLY get down to the actual story - which storyline could have been wrapped up in 15 minutes or so.

Personally, I think this movie was just supposed to be a cutesy little thing for children to enjoy - but yet, they end up killing the totally innocent boy in the end - and, had I not been watching with a Harry Potter encyclopedia fan, I wouldn't have had a clue who Griffindore or whoever he was, was. Honestly, JK Rowling has already made enough money off of this thing - this one made it seem like she's honestly doing a plain old money grab. Sad, really.

5938244,2,B005QI4U0W,"Lovely Movie But Eddie Redmayne is Impossible to Understand!! I love British comedies and dramas, which I watch a lot on TV and via DVD.

However, my group of friends gathered to watch this DVD and NONE OF US COULD UNDERSTAND HARDLY A WORD THE MAIN CHARACTER PLAYED BY EDDIE REDMAYNE SAID! Yes, he had a thick British accent, but the actor did nothing to enunciate the words clearly. He spoke softly and mumbled the words.

Frankly, after watching it half way, we began to figure out what was going on beyond the CGI but not based on anything this actor slurred together.

After watching it once, we sat there in silence and then everyone said the same thing: that the main character was appallingly bad in terms of his ability to clearly speak!

We actually watched it a second time WITH THE SUBTITLES ON and finally were able to read what this man was saying! At times we exclaimed ""THAT is what he was saying?!?!?! I never would have guessed.""  His regional UK accent was so thick that he might as well been speaking Italian.

This actor's speech was self-indulgent and tedious. Perhaps we are just uncultured Americans, but if you buy this, perhaps you should watch it with the subtitles on to save you from having to see it twice in one sitting!",1490745600,4,1250,4.533333333333333

5938248,4,B005QI4U0W,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is the title of a book mentioned in the novel Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and later inspired a novel by Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling that Warner Brothers adapted into the newly released movie. What may appear an entirely commercial decision to milk a cash cow still further is actually a film with great charm and a wonderful menagerie of imaginative creatures.

Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is a magizoologist who arrives in New York in 1926 carrying a suitcase filled with dozens of magical creatures. One of them, a Niffler  a platypus-type animal who hoards shiny things  escapes and makes its way into a bank where Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), a factory worker and No-Maj (as in no magic), is applying for a loan to open his own bakery. Jacobs similar-looking suitcase containing pastries is mistakenly switched with Newts, taking the would-be baker into a series of wild and often hilarious adventures.

The big change from the Potter books is that all the characters in Fantastic Beasts are adults. Yet Rowling, who wrote the screenplay, manages to infuse the film with a whimsical sense of fun as assorted creatures run amok in the city.

The movie looks terrific, with considerable time, effort, and dollars dedicated to bringing the book to life. Theres lots of computer-generated visuals, but they are so effectively rendered that the viewer is immersed in an amazing world that combines the recognizable with the fanciful.

The creatures are great fun, with the Niffler easily the funniest and best. The look of the film expands into the New York setting, with streets, vintage cars, buildings, and landmarks suggesting the way the city must have looked in the Roaring Twenties. This differs from the approach in the Potter books, which were set primarily in a world of magic. With an actual setting, the trials of Newt take on a more grounded feel.

Mr. Redmayne (The Danish Girl, The Theory of Everything) has an Aw shucks demeanor  a combination of bashfulness and enthusiasm  that works well in his portrayal of Newt, who finds himself in a sticky situation. His odd creatures are on the loose, hes responsible for them, and yet he has to keep them a secret from regular humans. With tousled hair, a surprised expression, and a winning smile, Newt is a socially awkward young man, preferring the company of animals to his fellow wizards. Despite all the visual dazzle, Redmayne manages to keep the story focused on Newts adventures and misadventures in for him  a strange world.

Mr. Fogler has considerable screen time as hapless Jacob, whose expressions provide lots of the films chuckles. His Everyman is likable because, even though he is part of the real world, he finds himself inadvertently in a mystical swirl. As a kind of cuddly fish-out-of water, Jacob is befuddled, perplexed, and often disoriented, yet surprisingly accepting of the amazing creatures and adventures to which hes subjected.

Other characters include a magic witch named Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterson), who turns Newt in to magic officials because she thinks hes acting suspiciously, and her telepathic sister Queenie (Alison Sudol), who has eyes for Jacob. Colin Farrell plays Graves, autocratic head of magic enforcement, Ron Perlman is a creepy-looking speakeasy proprietor, and Jon Voight plays a newspaper mogul eager to get his son elected to Congress.

David Yates, who directed the last four Harry Potter films, easily takes the viewer back into a magic-filled world. The movie could stand a bit of trimming, but the pace is brisk and practically every frame offers something to amaze, so its two hours-plus running time isn't a major drawback.

Rated PG-13, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them combines story, performances and special effects into a winning blend that results in a thoroughly entertaining experience.

Bonus extras on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include the featurette Before Harry Potter: A New Era of Magic Begins!; close looks at the unusual critters depicted in the movie, several featurettes devoted to the films unique production design; and deleted scenes. A digital HD copy is included. Other versions available include the 4K Ultra HD/ Blu-ray Combo Pack, Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo Pack, and DVD.",1490745600,,4295,5.089615931721195

The purpose of my review is to point out that yet again, Warner Bros. is posting blatant lies on their packaging, claiming that you will get a digital copy and that you can ""Watch It Anywhere"" (their words).

The thing is, you can't.  It won't work in iTunes or Windows Media Player--you must download their third-party application (""Flixster"").  You also cannot even download the movie (FAQ response on their site:  ""Unfortunately, Movies All Access does not currently offer the ability to download your films."").  Therefore, to watch a digital copy, you have to install unnecessary software, agree to their terms, and then waste your bandwidth streaming the movie because you cannot download it.

5938341,4,B005QI4U0W,"This review can be found on my blog Crimson Blogs About Books. I watched this movie in theatres

Fantastic Beasts is set in 1926 New York, about 60 years prior to the Harry Potter series. Here we follow Newt Scamander as he travels to NY after having finished an excursion where he documented a series of magical creatures and even kept some in his suitcase. Of course, his little detour in NY becomes more of an adventure as one of his creatures escapes his case, wreaks havoc in a bank, and hes caught breaking the wizarding laws in America while the community is in a crisis of exposure!

Sounds really fun, no?

One of the more obvious reasons I wanted to watch this movie was that Id been watching all the (more recent) Harry Potter movies in theaters and this was, in a way, a Harry Potter movie, so I felt an obligation to myself to go and see this. Another was that the setting was in America. While location was never a concern for me, because magical word, who cares? just saying this was going to happen in America got me curious. Would it be different? How? Would we see some of the people from the HP series when they were younger?! (You have no idea how much I need this)

In a way we did get slight mentions of Dumbledore and Hogwarts, but they were never really the focus of the movie. The one character that did overlap both worlds, however, was Grindelwald. I won't really go into too much detail here because that would mean SPOILERS and honestly, I hadnt known about him until this movie

--

Characters

In terms of human characters, I was rather disappointed. We have our main protagonist, Newt Scamander who has a bunch of nearly extinct creatures in his suitcase, is studying them, and is trying to get one to Arizona, its natural habitat. But other than this quirky habit of caring for them and doing strange mating rituals, theres not much else to him. Yes, hes brave, yes hes got some connection to Dumbledore, but not much else.

Even his suitcase had more personality /sigh/

Throughout the whole movie I also had a hard time deciphering what he was saying! I thought maybe it was because of his (natural) accent but when I looked him up on the internet later, I found I could understand himwhy he was mumbling and extra accent-y is beyond me. (I mean, if they got Draco to enunciate, why couldn't they do it here? lol)

We also meet Tina who is part of the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) and the one who ends up arresting Newt when he first arrives in NY (his niffler escapes and causes mayhem!). Of course, her arresting him and taking him in clue us in that shes been demoted and is no longer supposed to be arresting wizards (for some reason). Instead of letting Newt go, she becomes his shadow stalker and helps him recover his suitcase, which had been taken by a No-maj (muggle) who mistook it for his.

I initially didn't care much for her because she was just doing her job, but as the movie progresses she becomes more annoying. She pretty much has Newt under house arrest, follows him out when he escapes said house arrest, and gets him into trouble a lot. Like woman, Im sure there are other law breaking magical citizens out there, why the obsession here?!

I also felt it was harder to connect with her because she was the more selfish of the characters. All her actions were less because she was worried about exposure and more about trying to get promoted/recognition. Even at the end, when she had a change in character, I still didn't like her because her change came from self-preservation.

Plus, she was useless.

And the prize for human characters goes to lovebirds Jacob and Queenie! You have no idea how much I loved these two and how they interacted!

Here we have Jacob Kowalski (aspiring baker) and Tinas sister and roommate, Queenie Goldstein. Jacob is the no-maj who just happened to be at the wrong place when Newts niffler causes mayhem in NY. Accidentally taking Newts suitcase, Jacob releases a number of creatures out into the streets of NY and even gets bitten by one of them. Instead of being Obliviated, Jacob ends up helping Newt gather up his creatures.

I think I was particularly attracted to Jacobs character because he was a no-maj and was just so fascinated by the magical creatures. He helped out Newt care for them in the suitcase, he got chased by a huge Erumpent that wanted to mate with him, and still didn't freak out because technically this stuff isn't supposed to exist, right?

And then we have Queenie, who seems to be pretty lady of the series. She looks good and knows how to use that charm to her advantage! She is also well versed in legilimency, a sort of mind-reading ability, which I absolutely loved. I actually didn't think shed be a main character but she surprised me in actually taking action (unlike someone else in this movie)

Just going to say that near the end she has a scene with Jacob that legit broke my heart.

And don't even get me started with all the creatures inside Newts suitcase! I absolutely loved ALL of them! They all had such amazing personalities and I seriously wanted to help Newt take care of them. One of my favorites was this Niffler who loves taking shiny stuff and storing them into his bottomless pit of a stomach pouch

--

Magical Problems in NY

New York has recently been having problems with exposure as there is some creature out there wreaking havoc and a group called the New Salem Philanthropic Society are doubling their efforts to expose witches and kill them (because who else could be behind something so out of this world?). Of course, this means MACUSA needs to hurry up and find said creature unless they want to face exposure (except its never that simple)

To keep things spoiler free, the movie tried to confuse us as to who the creature was and very much failed. Not to mention that everything turned out a little TOO convenient if you ask me

--

Overall

Overall I think the movie was OK. It really tried to cram so many ideas into a 2 hour (ish) film, which I felt was its biggest downfall. I mean, the majority of the movie was spent finding the creatures that had escaped Newts bag, which I felt should have been enough for the one movie. But then they had to add the whole exposure aspect, which was less detailed and more rushed.

AND THEN, they had this whole Newt and Tina scene that made me want to facepalm because they had so little connection but it felt like they were lovers who had to part. We already had the Jacob and Queenie thing going for the romance aspect, why are we forcing these other two into something like that?? I don't know, to me it felt very unnatural and awkward

Another thing I wanted to mention (that probably has more to do with me), is that it was hard to watch this movie. At the beginning we get bombarded by a bunch of newspapers in quick succession that its hard to read any of them and even made me dizzy. This happened a couple more times in the movie (focus, unfocus, very fast movement) and I just really didn't like it.

I did hear Fantastic Beasts was going to be a total of 5 movies and that Newt wasn't going to be the protagonist in the next one. Im not sure how I feel about this. Part of me is like ok because Newt just wasn't my favorite but Im also worried about too many characters being introduced and not getting enough development.

The nice thing about Harry Potter was that we had the same characters and we got to see them develop and grow. In this case it seems less about the world and more about creating more movies.",1490313600,,7555,4.457577955039884

Although I followed the plot, it left a lot to be desired. The CG was wonderful, the beasts were good, however it opened with some beast destroying NYC, but Newt hadn't arrived yet. Some parts of the plot were disjointed, as if it was an after thought put in. They could have developed the relationship between characters a lot more. The introduction of Johnny Depp at the end made absolutely zero sense. Overall a huge disappointment, I should have waited until the movie was free!!!!",1490313600,,631,4.736363636363636

5938378,5,B005QI4U0W,"This was a screenplay that was actually written by JK Rowling, which is awesome. No, its not a book, but she sets us up with knowledge for this movie with information on her website Pottermore. She has information about MACUSA and no-majs, as well as other schools in other countries, such as Ilvermorny in America. This is the same wizarding world of Harry Potter, but this series is looking ti set up the history of Grindlewald, the dark wizard before Voldemort, and Dumbledore's old comrade. There are so many details thrown in here that relate to things that are talked about in the Harry Potter books, and they help to clear up some questions. If you have read the books, read the Pottermore site, or even watched Jk interviews, this may be easier for you to understand. This world has become very in depth. As for the magical creatures, there are a plethora of them, and they are so fun to meet! Especially everyone's favorite, the niffler. The character's are all so fun, I really loved Queenie, the witch skilled in ligilimens, and was happy to learn the singer from A Fine Frenzy plays as her. There are so many hilarious parts, so many serious parts, and I found ir difficult not to love it. This movie set up a strong base for the next movies coming, and I truly cannot wait. My husband loved it so much after we saw it in theaters, that he wnated to go see it seceral more times in theaters. I fell in love with Harry Potter when I was just 11 years old, and now at 25, I am so happy that JK Rowling is giving us more to love!! I cannot wait to find out more about Leta Lestrange, why Newt was expelled, and more about Grindlewald and Dumbledore's relationship, as well as Ariana Dumbledore!

5938389,1,B005QI4U0W,"First off, I just want to state my level of fanboy concerning HP so you don't think I am atroll. I started reading the series in 1999, went to every midnight book release, saw every movie in theaters multiple times, continued to re-read each book an average of twice a year and have read everything on pottermore. So here are some thoughts from a true potter fan.

THE GOOD:
The sets- This movie had a great combination of actual sets and CGI. The entire city wasn't CGI like the marvel movies and most blockbusters. I 100% bought the 1920s world of new York. It in fact just won an academy award. I opposed David Yates returning but he did a great job visually bringing us back to the world.

The actors- Everyone did a great job in this movie (aside from Depp). I absolutely loathe Eddie Redmayne but my baggage did not obstruct the performance. He had the perfect dash of quirky and was excellent (although the character itself is problematic, more on that later). The casting was top notch and I have no problem visiting these characters in future films (as long as the films get better).

The Niffler- My god I loved the niffler It just made me so happy. He was so damn cute, funny and leaped straight out of the book and into a purse. All of the animals overall were great.

THE BAD:
The story- This film should not have focused on Newt. The best thing about this movie is exploring America and the social struggles and seeing the plot from Grindlewald unfold. The extremely forced Order of the Phoenix style newspaper headlines for crammed exposition should have actually been in the film. This film focused too much on Newt showing off animals to the audience. The ending was also a slap in the face to potter fans. The best part of the books was finding out exactly how everything came together, and we get none of that. All we get is a Scooby-doo twist that rain wipes the slate clean, making this movie completely pointless in the grand scheme of things and hardly gets us excited for the future.

Newts characterization- While I liked Eddies performance, Newt was a terrible protagonist. Newt has no awareness or respect for the political climate of America and thinks he can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. Doesnt bother to obliviate, commits muggle/wizard crimes and is extremely casual about POSSIBLY STARTING A WIZARDING WAR AND EXPOSING WIZARDKIND!!!!!!! Claims his animals aren't dangerous, but has to tell one of them to not eat the brains of a human And why exactly is Newt in America? To release an animal illegally into the wild

Grindlewald- Holy crap this was an epic fail. He looks like a cartoonish villain even though he was a normal looking wizard in Deathly Hallows. You may say but Voldemort looked like a villain! However, not only did that look better, but he had split his soul seven times and was resurrected through a potion. Its another wacky Johnny Depp role, rather than a distinguished wizard to be feared.

THE UGLY:
There is really only one ugly aspect, but it has many bullet points.
J.K ROWLING F***ED UP CANNON AND THE FILM IS RIDDLED WITH MASSIVE INCONSISTENCIES!!!!!!!!!!

Legilimency is explicitly explained in the books to NOT BE MIND READING. It is more of a way to gauge the emotions and intentions of a character, to quote Snape the mind is not simply a book to be read. Not only that, but legilimency is a learned skill, not something you are born with. In this movie, Queenie reads minds left and right in the most clich way possible, and it is implied that she was born with it. Absolutely ridiculous that JK would overlook this for the sake of a film trope.

The obscurous- So this is a fairly interesting concept that I know a lot of people will dig, however I couldn't accept it. An obscurous is some type of void entity that spawns when a persons magic is suppressed and they are abused. It is said they have not appeared in centuries, except for one case that Newt discovered. Ok, first of all its ridiculous that Credence is the only wizard who is pushed to this point. Its like saying only 1 kid in New York is in a traumatic household. The other thing is abused wizards have already been established. Merope Gaunt, Ariana Dumbledore and you know HARRY F***ING POTTER!!!! J.K has even said that Ariana might have been an obscurous, which also is bonkers because in the book she died during a 3 way duel. If she did com-bust into a void, Dumbledore would not have lived with the guilt that he might have killed her during the duel. He is the greatest wizard ever and would have known about an obscurous. You can make some flimsy arguments about this topic, but they are all what ifs? and not backed up by anything. For me, its all bogus.

J.K made wizards live to 150 to fit this films timeline- Sorry people, despite what J.K and potter wikis say, wizards were only recently established to live long lives and its BS. There is no mention in the books about living longer and there are a million times when it could have been brought up. The books often have things to make the readers yearn for the world, and a longer life is one of the most desired. Ron never says when researching the Sorcerers stone by the way Harry, Wizards live longer than muggles! There is no jealousy from muggles present in the books. There is no mention of the difficulty wizard and muggle couples would have dealing with a large lifespan gap. This would have not only been present as an individual struggle, but could have been used as an argument for pure bloods. It is simply never ever, ever mentioned or implied. The oldest person is Auntie Muriel, who is said to be 107. However, it is implied that she is nearing the end of her days and is losing it. She says ""I'm 107"" like its an obvious indicator of her physical struggles, One major example in the movies in present in Half-Blood Prince. Hermione mentions that people think Dumbledore is losing it in his age. Harry says he cant be that old, he is like what? Ron replies 150? and they all have a good laugh, because it is inconceivable for a person to be that age. We muggles make the same types of joke. This is explicit proof that wizards cant live that long.

As a film fan, I would give this a 3 star rating, as a Potter fan, it barely gets a 1. This movie ignores the books completely and is targeted at people who only have watched the movies. I would understand this if it was another writer, but this is Rowling herself ruining her world. I truly think that she never re-read Harry Potter and forgot most of what she had written. J.K is oversaturating HP with too many first draft ideas on pottermore. She is trying to flesh out her world like Tolkien, except she wasn't a professor of Anglo-Saxon mythology and language.",1489708800,3,6738,4.5147540983606556
5938390,4,B005QI4U0W,"If you're expecting a Harry Potter experience then be prepared for slight disappointment. While this movie is set in the same universe the feel of the movie comes across totally different from the Hogwarts films at least to me. Sure it has wands and wizardry but it just felt like it was missing the feeling of the previous films. Not a bad movie in my opinion though, just not as entertaining.",1489708800,2,394,4.563380281690141

The storyline for this film is set before Harry Potter. If you have read any of the extras besides the main books, you have probably come across some of the history alread, but this film is the beginning of the detailed history of what happened before there was a Harry Potter. I look forward to the next films. I also wish this was going to be released as another book series, but it looks like that is not the case.",1489708800,12,651,4.336065573770492
5938392,1,B005QI4U0W,"It seemed to me this movie was nothing more than an over-glorified P.E.T.A. ad.  You really expect me to believe that only ONE wizard ever cared about magical creatures?  For a fairly long movie, it has relatively no plot.  The love stories are very contrived and shallow and while parts of the movie were very pretty, several parts were downright cringe-worthy.  There seemed to be a fair share of opinion jabs in there that seemed to take away from the ""magic"" of the story.  I'll stick to Harry Potter, thanks.",1489622400,,513,4.655555555555556

Excellent, but I can only attribute most of that to my Internet connection, but the movie was great and it downloaded and is in my view file to be watched at any time. The only problem I ever have with these types of things is that exactly what happened this time I don't have one instance of me paying for this singular product. I have two instances where I was charged for this product. I was told that it would be solved. And I'm going on day number two and it still has not been resolved. I know a lot of people say that it's only $14 and some change but when you're charged for something twice. It just doesn't sit well in your mind. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie but I don't think I need to be charged twice so buyer beware. Make sure you understand how this operation works before you click that button but my family did enjoy the movie. Well, at least half of the family were not all home at the same time anymore so it's a good thing to have the in a repository where it could be viewed by the whole family, even if it's not all at once, and I don't have to deal with those CDs back in the day that was the thing and you could watch it whenever you want to put this set up is a lot better. I can still watch it whenever I want to and I don't have to keep those CDs out of the reach of the little ones and hope that they last as long as possible. There could be things that could happen online. I guess, but at least I'll have someone to argue about when that happens",1489622400,,1524,3.96742671009772

5938413,5,B005QI4U0W,"MAJOR Harry Potter fan over here, but did not see this in theaters cuz my husband said he wasn't interested (I am not one to go alone anywhere) so I waited for it to come out. Surprisingly, my husband was the one that insisted we buy it instead of rent because he heard people talking about it at work, even though he said some people didn't like it and others, including an HP fan like myself, really liked it. I didn't watch any previews and heard mixed things from people as well but not from another fan directly, so I had no expectations and was happy to find that I LOVED IT!!! Maybe some people disagree with this, but I liked that almost everything was new...so people who weren't Potterheads didn't had to have seen previous movies (obviously they wouldn't have read the books cuz there's no logical way you can read them and not love them)...they did have some references and a major character that was only mentioned a lot in the HP books, so that was fun for me. I do have some nitpicking gripes about minor things that I'll go over below (**so don't keep reading past this paragraph to avoid spoilers!!**), but overall the movie was fast-paced from the second it started and I loved every second of it. One of the supporting characters was simply outstanding (not Redmayne) and he made my husband laugh very hard, and he made me sob like a baby at the end! I thought I had it all figured out, and I pretty much did, but I received a shock about my prediction and that just made it all better! It made me jump (a LOT) and one point I actually got off the couch to stand in front of the TV without knowing what I was doing because I was so enthralled. 10/10!

**POTENTIAL SPOILERS**
Here are the minor gripes I had (but weren't enough to take away from it overall cuz I'm not a judgemental brat like that):
1) the main girl character was wretched. I really hope we don't see her again cuz she was sooo annoying and just blech
2) There was a LOT of sub-storylines and I NEED AN ACTUAL BOOK FOR THIS PLEASE MS. ROWLING!!!
3) I have a lot of questions about a lot of things that, unless I somehow missed it all, went unanswered.
4) what was up with the President's hair??
5) American's should not have their own terms for Muggles. Nonmag...that just sounds gross and unnecessary
6) I couldn't understand a lot of what Eddie was saying, mainly because I'm horrible with accents but I felt like he could have pronounced things a bit clearer or spoken more slowly
7) WHY DID THEY DO THAT TO JACOB?! WHYYYYYYY (sobbing)",1489536000,2,2523,4.37953091684435

It's the kind of film that people today need to see.",1489363200,,581,4.596153846153846
5938433,5,B005QI4U0W,"As a massive ""Harry Potter"" fan, I couldn't wait to see this, especially after the disappointment that was ""The Cursed Child."" Eddie Redmayne is one of my favorite actors after his portrayal as Professor Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything,"" and my excitement for this movie increased with each trailer and TV spot showing him as the protagonist, Newt Scamander, a name familiar only to the most die-hard fans of the Wizarding World.

The plot needs no introduction. Trailers galore and the description on sites such as IMDb and Amazon, etc., tell you all you need to know without spoilers. That said, it's a great story, brought to life by Rowling and the cast of characters and, yes, beasts. From the moment the music starts, fans will feel right at home.

Characters like Jacob Kowalsky, Porpentina Goldstein and her sister Queenie, Percival Graves, Creedence Barebone (and the worst haircut ever committed to film), Seraphina Picquery, and more make the world come alive as Newt steps into a different sort of magical world, with a different school and different terminology. In fact, the characters are my favorite part of the film, Kowalski and the Goldstein sisters being the obvious standouts.

The creatures themselves are wonderful. They're weird, often cute, and always interesting. The only downside I can find with them, and perhaps my biggest flaw with the film in general, is that a few of the creatures that aren't focal points don't look incredibly real; the CGI doesn't look nearly as polished on them.

Besides that one minor flaw, the movie was spectacular, especially for a big fan of ""Harry Potter"" like myself. Without spoilers, there is only a single part of the film I feel could have been taken out, and it lasts only about two or three minutes.

When all is said and done, either as an introduction to the Wizarding World or a return, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a great time for people both young and old.",1489276800,,1959,4.8532934131736525

5938438,2,B005QI4U0W,"I love Harry Potter and this was a HUGE disappointment. First, the original series (at least the first few books) appealed to children. It gave them a sense of wonder and a feeling of empowerment. While they fought the ""Dark Lord"" nothing was presented too brutally. By later books much of the whimsy was replaced with darkness and horrific scenes of pain and torture which I didn't like and wouldn't let my 10 year old read. This story is charming in that it portrays several beautiful or adorable fantastic beasts. The plot, however, is dull. There are 2 villains. One adopts children and then repeatedly beats and tortures them. NOT appropriate for children. I didn't even understand the other villain - the backstory is too nebulous to determine why we should fear him or fight him. At least I wanted the evil step-mother to die.

Perhaps if this had been released as a book prior to the movie we would understand these relationships better. As an adult I felt no connection to the characters. There was little or no development in the main characters. I never saw any affection developing between Newt and Tina, but the chemistry between Queenie and Jacob was darling.  Many shortcuts were taken in the Harry Potter movies relative to the books. The movies are good alone. They are great if you've read the books because they do skip over important bits that you can fill in if you know the story. I felt the same about Fantastic Beasts - if I had known the story and the characters from reading a book I wouldn't have found the movie so shallow and boring.",1489276800,2,1562,4.635379061371841

He soon gets entangled with an agent from magical enforcement(Tina),  and a no maj (Jacob). They meet up with Tina's sister Queenie who is a great addition to the colorful cast of characters.
  It stays true to the series, and there's plenty of continuity detail for those HP geeks like me who love to keep the storyline legit! I couldn't help but parallel the prejudices with the no-maj (non magic/muggle) against the magic community with the general religious ferver and prejudices we have in our country today... great, subtle, poignant.

Two days later, couldn't help myself....had to see again.  It transcends its plot in that the viewer wants to spend time with all these characters and the actors are pulling off authenticity so well that a second viewing leaves the deeper entertainments -- viewing these souls in the throes -- unmitigated.  Did many pauses to study the screen -- didn't bother my feel for the pacing.  I truly was interested in the story despite knowing so much.

3rd viewing not many days later.  Just a wonderful film with so much detailed and creativity.

8-14-17 4th viewing was remarkably able to still entertain me, and I would not willingly admit how much I'd forgotten ""enough"" to freshen up the piece.  The parts I remembered could be a film by themselves, and the parts I didn't remember could be a half dozen more.  Nice world they've imagineered.  And I have not mentioned THE BABE lest I come off droolish.  But, yeah, I still don't know who else was in her scenes.  I joke, but you know what I'm sayin'.  I'll gladly watch again within months, but can I hold out that long?  It's so sucks that I watch my favorites too much too soonly and get the works memorized too well to forget easily except by a great deal longer passage of time.  Speaking of which I ruined Passengers that way.  Now I'm in Passenger Prison -- doin' time until it gets renewed and watchable.  Don't make me admit how many other films I've gotten to way-passed-saturation.  Next up for this temptation is Wonder Woman being released in two weeks.

The real world is filled with many people that think differently, have different attitudes and thus enjoy life in different ways.  Unfortunately some viewers seek to make it miserable for everyone else when they should do the opposite to seek happiness as happiness is not found in self gratification or poor attitudes. I personally found this movie refreshing and a good mix of reality and fantasy.  However I am uncertain a sequel movie is a good idea as I don't think there is enough intellectual complexity to create one.

5938474,2,B005QI4U0W,"Calling this Fantastic Beasts is like naming HP Ron Weasley. Could someone take JKs billions long enough to make her hungry for a great story again?
Pros:
New characters, different perspective in the world of HP. A+ actors (most of them) Decent CG and a wow at the end (for the actual actor not the character) Newt is one of those characters that will grow on you. He's a weirdo thats easy to like. Funny moments you can appreciate with supporting actors
Cons- It's fillers, no real story. Expecting Newt to run around like a Pokemon trainer picking up Beasts? forget it. That's about 15 mins of the movie and you've seen it in the trailers already. You can guess who the antagonist is 20 minutes in. It's like seeing a celebrity on Law and Order, you just know. The twists aren't twists, just lazy writing that hopes you'll be distracted by jazz fingers, then it's over. The credits run leaving you wondering if you missed the part about the Fantastic Beasts. Again, if you've seen the trailer you've seen all the beasts. CG zoo for 5 minutes and that's it.
Such an opportunity to be a great movie instead it's lazy namedropping. Not awful, but it wasn't good.",1488844800,3,1161,4.559808612440191

5938482,5,B005QI4U0W,"Note: This is a review of the 16-disc UK box set released in 2016 with a zoomed-out Harry casting a spell on the cover.

This is an absolutely wonderful set! Discs play perfectly, packaging is well-designed, and it includes enough bonus content to satisfy a casual fan. (If you're hardcore on extras, the 31-disc Hogwarts set might suit you better.)

Stray observations:

There are 8 discs for the films themselves, while the others comprise the 8-part documentary Creating the World of Harry Potter. Extras specific to the films can be found on the movie discs (most are largely similar as the features on previous DVD editions).

The cardboard sleeves are pretty but a little on the flimsy side. Don't manhandle them too much.

This set was made in the UK, but since BRs are not region-locked, they should play in any BR player in the US (I use my PS4 and they run just fine). However, if you want the UV copies and live in the States, you will have to call Warner Bros to redeem and remove the lock on those.

It definitely had a different feel than the previous HP movies, darker, older, more mature. But it's still neat to see the origins of some of the HP lore",1488499200,,453,4.329411764705882

I've seen lots of 5 star reviews for this movie and understand why. However, for me personally, the story could have had more depth and the characters and their relationships needed a bit more development. This movie could use a prequel!

Overall, this movie was pretty dark in comparison to other HP movies. It also dealt with heavier political and social themes. There was a spotlight on death, anger, and abuse.

5938511,5,B005QI4U0W,"Produced and written by J.K Rowling - a fantasy adventure, a spin-off from the highly successful and popular 'Harry Potter
books/movies. (Her first attempt at screen-writting)
'Newt Scamander' (Eddie Redmayne)  a wizard and majizoologist apparently exiled from 'Hogwarts'  arrives by boat in
New York en-route to Arizona.
It's 1926, all is not well in New York strange things have been occurring, the blame directed at the local-magical society
who arouse deep suspicion and mistrust by their very presence....the society point the finger toward a dark-magician
'Gellert Grindelwald' the identity of whom is not known.
'Newt' carries a suitcase that has endless secrets within, magical and humongous creatures, when one accidentally escapes
a Niffler who is attracted to  shinny objects, 'Newt' chases it into the bank where an unsuspecting factory-worker/ wannabe
-baker 'Jacob Kowalski' (Dan Fogler) carrying an identical suit-case is trying to obtain a loan for a new shop venture from the
manager.
The cases are accidentally switched, 'Newt' has a case full of cakes, 'Jacob' carries a bag full of mysterious creatures.
'Newt' is charged for using magic without licence but released when it is found his case only contains cakes.....he is joined in
his search for his case by 'Tina'...after finding it, she takes 'Newt' and 'Jacob' home introducing them to her sister 'Queenie'
(Alison Sudoi) who takes an instant shine to the very confused 'Jacob' though romance is not permitted for American Witches
with No-Maj's such as is 'Jacob'
Well, the adventure continues for the unsuspecting 'Jacob' when he is taken into 'Newt's' magical case where he will meet
many of the creatures cared for by the majizoologist...nervously of course, but he does grow into the introduction..........
just how much can fit into a case ??
 'Newt'  is arrested along with confused accomplice 'Jacob' and 'Tina' (Katherine Waterston) who is a member of the New York
wizard society, who has tried to help catch the creatures that had escaped from the case, by officials believing one of 'Newt's'
creatures had killed presidential candidate senator Henry Shaw Jr.
'Jacob' is released, but 'Tina' and 'Newt' face a death sentence imposed by Director of Magical Security Percival Graves (Colin
Farrell)  accused of being in cahoots with the dark-magician...however they are rescued by 'Jacob' and 'Queenie'
Because of the destructive power of the Obscurus  'Graves' seeks it's host with intent to harness it's magic, whilst 'Newt' knows
he has to find the real cause of the destruction in New York knowing his creatures not to be responsible, but unlike 'Graves'
only wants to help the troubled-soul.
Mayhem follows as both men clash in the subway tunnel where the Obscurus host is found........
Has this all been a dream for 'Jacob' and indeed the people of New York ?? ......all's well that ends well  ?
A delightful tale with much humour and indeed superb special-effects throughout....set many years before Harry Potter's days..
in truth there are few links between the times, one or two characters that link, and of course the use of the wand.
J.K.Rowling's stories will, in my view, always be box-office hits because of the Potter series.....
This is certainly great family entertainment though perhaps a little scary for the very young.

5938553,5,B005QI4U0W,"As a hardcore Harry Potter fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  You have to realize that this is an entertainment movie so if you are looking for something that will change the way you think or will challenge you to become a better person, this is not your movie.  This is meant to entertain, and on that point, it is a smashing success!  I very much prefer the books to the movies, especially the early movies just because most child actors are so terrible.  Most of them turned out okay by the Half Blood Prince, but before that they were a little rough.  This movie had all of the elements I liked from the previous Harry Potter movies, exciting, engaging, interesting characters, ""fantastic creatures"", and great special effects, without the annoying cheesiness of the early Harry Potter movies.  If you love Harry Potter, then you will love this.  The inverse is probably true as well, if you didn't like the Harry Potter movies then you probably shouldn't watch this because you probably won't like it.

For me this movie embodied everything I like about the magical world without anything that really detracts. Its not a perfect movie, I could have done with a little more character development of the main character, but other than that there is nothing not to like.  I highly recommend this to any Harry Potter fans.",1484265600,4,1327,4.734782608695652

It was also easy enough to contact UV and have them credit the movies for our region, so we are definitely keeping this. Overall, love this set.

5938592,1,B005QI4U0W,"I just watched Magical Beasts and where to find them and I'm really turned off by the American Wizards.

1. The bad fake New York accents.

2. They all wear 1920s clothes, perfectly mundane 1920s clothes .Why do the British Wizards get to wear the cool eccentric robes but American wizards dress so plainly? And ""No Maj"" is really, really irritating.

3. Finally, the British Wizards have no death sentence but American wizards kill pretty eagerly. They know New York isn't Texas, right?!? Also why do the Wizards reflect the No Maj / Muggle politics? I would have hoped wizards (as they can travel anywhere very quickly) would have a more unified culture. And America wouldn't be treated as a uber modern / strict / harsh place. They need permits to have a wand?! And again... Why don't they wear robes? These are European descended wizards. Why wouldn't they have robes yet in the UK wizards wear traditional Wizard garb all the time. I feel J. K. Rowling is showing some innate bigotry against Americans here that has depleted the whimsy factor and made this portion of the wizarding world unnecessarily cold, sterile, and in certain aspects idiotic.

 And don't get me started on their rules about wizards not being allowed to interact with ""No Maj.""  God, I hate that term...  America's English developed differently from the original British English partly thanks to the Webster Dictionary changing particular words.  So WHY would Wizard slang be different?!  It makes no sense!

Perhaps someone should have shown her the Halloweentown movies from the Disney Channel featuring the late Debbie Reynolds. That was Harry Potter-esque yet set in America without taking away the whimsy and sense of Old World magical charm. And didn't require turning Americans into vaguely obnoxious stereotypes. It was charming despite the low budget. The wizards in America SHOULD have behaved just like the ones in the UK. People are people no matter where you are, after all. We are all human. Skip this. And re-watch Halloweentown in Debbie Reynolds memory. You won't regret it.

All 8 films in Blu Ray. (British version so film one is ""The Philosophers Stone."")
8 other Blu Ray disks of extras. (There are many hours of extras that any potter fan will find very interesting!!! I actually watched these disks before the movies.)

The packaging is as minimal as you can get, nothing fancy. You will receive a single cardboard box set, with four bi-folded cardboard DVD boxes, each holds 4 disks, with the top two disks being the movies, and the bottom two disks being the extras, so that if you opened all of the bi-folded compartments they would line up with the eight movies across the top and all of the extras across the bottom.

The only thing that keeps me from giving this order ""Five Stars"" is that if you live in the US, you will not be able to download the digital version that is supposed to come with the set.

5938631,1,B005QI4U0W,"Ugh, this movie was a waste of 133 minutes of life, a total fraud and ripoff by J.K. Rowlings,  Warner, and Heyday Films designed for the sole purpose of milking a few hundred millions dollars more of profit from the Harry Potter fanbase.

I went to see this movie in the theater with my three kids, who are more knowledgeable about the Harry Potter world than I am.  One daughter was a real Harry Potter fan when she was younger, and even she said the movie did not have much of a plot or any real purpose.  Although I am not a fan, I have seen all of the Harry Potter movies, usually with my kids, and they are at least somewhat entertaining.

You can summarize the plot of  ""Fantastical Beasts"" very simply - a young man goes to 1920's New York City for no particular reason, fights an evil wizard for no particular reason, all sorts of magical creatures appear and disappear along the way for no particular reason, and then .... The End.

This movie basically tried to stuff a constant stream of cameo appearances by magical creatures in place of a real plot with relatable human characters.  As a result, throughout the movie there were many of these ""Behold!"" moments  -

""Behold!  Another wondrous and magical creature!  I, the great J. K. Rowlings have created this for you, my loyal fans!  Because I know you have no life, and you hunger for more of  my creations, and you will keep giving me more of your money to see this dreck!""

To make things worse, Eddie Redmayne is also one of my Not Favorite actors of all time, a feeling that is only reinforced by this awful movie.  He's pretty good at playing transgenders and people crippled by neurodegenerative disorders, but otherwise, I find him a grating presence in any other sort of movie.

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them begins with an immediately likeable British wizard Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne) arriving in 1920s New York City. Through a bit of a mix up, he befriends Jacob Kowalski (played by Dan Fogler), a lovable muggle aspiring to someday run his own bakery. Unfortunately, Newt soon discovers that the relations between magic peoples and muggles (called No-Majs in America) are strained. Marriages between the two groups are strictly forbidden, and allowing No-Majs to have knowledge of magic society in any way is illegal. Tensions are further strained due to a recent and mysterious series of magic-related events destroying parts of the city, and an anti-witchcraft group who reveres the Salem Witch Trials.

With a suitcase full of larger-than-life animals and an illegal No-Maj friend, Newt is swiftly caught by Porpentina Goldstein (played by Katherine Waterston), an ex-Auror working for the Magical Congress of the United States of America (abbreviated MACUSA). Newt and Jacob end up befriending Porpentina (Tina) and her ditsy mind-reading sister, Queenie. Like Harry, Hermione, and Ron from J. K. Rowlings original book series, these four diverse characters make up our new dream-team.

Through the eyes of these characters, the film gives us a brief tour of 1920s American magic society, most notably its extremely interesting version of the death penalty and the interior of the MACUSA government building. In addition, we get to see the expansive, museum-like magical biomes inside Newts suitcase, and finally a real erumpent. However, as we are seeing this heavily guarded magical world through the eyes of an adult accustomed to most of its workings, a great deal of the magic conveyed in the Harry Potter films is lost. The film becomes more of a period-piece with magic, rather than a magical period-piece.

In addition, the color tones of the film are primarily dark and more or less brown, similar to the color scheme of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. This dark coloring is in part to convey the darker emotional tone of both movies, however, as this is our first entry into magical America, it significantly dulls the experience. Another similarity between these two films is the double story line. In Harry Potter, the first half of the film centers around a mysterious book. In the second half, however, the real problem comes to light: a plot to kill Dumbledore. The popularity of both the book and movie for the Harry Potter installment is due in part to the masterful interweaving of these storylines. In Fantastic Beasts, however, the two storylines are almost completely separate. The first is the story surrounding Newts suitcase and the animals that escape it. The second, and far more emotionally compelling, centers around the anti-witchcraft group.

This second storyline is by far the best thing the film has to offer, and its a shame that it wasn't woven in as closely with Newts suitcase as the two Harry Potter storylines. It almost feels like watching two separate movies  one for children during the first half, and one for adults in the second.

Although it seems imperfectly worked in to the film, this second storyline is extremely compelling. It centers around an idea briefly but repeatedly hinted at in the Harry Potter books: that a childs suppression of his or her magical ability can lead to one of the most destructive and abhorrent forces possible in the magical world: an Obscurus. Combine this with a young adult who is constantly beaten and abused by his extremely religious adoptive mother, and you get Credence, this movies main antagonist. Unlike Voldemort, we learn almost right away of the absolutely horrible life of this man, and also briefly his past relationship with Tina.

Once he reaches his breaking point, the magic suppressed within Credence begins to destroy the city, and it takes all of MACUSA to contain him. Newt and Tina are almost successful in calming him down and bringing him back to human form, but they are too late. He is killed, or at least mostly killed, by MACUSA, but a tiny wisp of his Obscurus floats away. Another government worker, who was the cause of Credences Obscurus release when he denied the boys ability to learn magic, is revealed to be Grindelwald, previously a friend but now an arch-enemy of Dumbledore, too fond of the mantra, for the greater good.

Speculation: Throughout the film, it is shown that Newt has some special relationship with Dumbledore and an Obscurus. Perhaps the missing link is Dumbledores daughter, as the books made it clear that Dumbledores main regret was that he neglected to care for his younger sister, who suppressed her magic due to childhood bullying, and who ended up killing her own mother. Possibly, she was the obscurus kept by Newt in his suitcase and the girl he mentioned being friends with. As this film series progresses, it is still unclear who will be the main villain. Grindelwald and Credence seem like the clear choices, but which is worse: an emotionally damaged young adult with immense, uncontrollable power, or an extremely powerful and experienced wizard whose ideals ensure the destruction of only non-magic people? J. K. Rowling is still keeping us guessing and speculating, and thats one of the biggest pieces of praise I have for the movie. In all the unexplained backstories mentioned throughout the film, there is still a huge potential for these to be as good or better than the Harry Potter films.",1481760000,2,5522,5.027322404371585

5938645,4,B005QI4U0W,"It doesn't have all that engrossing charm of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, but I'm not a child any more and this movie isn't trying to be Harry Potter. It has a style, tone and pacing that's quite different from any of the Harry Potter movies, and that's fine. The story, much like its protagonist, searches around for what's important and has a lot of fun along the way. What some view as aimlessness I see as character-driven narrative. It takes a while for the full story to come into focus because the protagonist and his friends aren't privy to the full story. That's not bad writing, a lack of direction, or aimlessness, it's a style of storytelling.

Positives:
+The world and characters are a lot of fun.
+One or two of the fantastic beasts fall flat, but most of them are amazing to behold. Very good creature design, and a lot of thought went into making them feel interesting and unique.
+Top-notch performances. The acting in FBaWTFT is on par with the best performances in the Harry Potter series. Eddie Redmayne, Colin Farrell, Ezra Miller, and Dan Fogler are real stand-outs, putting a lot of heart and depth into the characters.
+It isn't smacking you in the face with ""THIS IS HARRY POTTER"" stuff all the time, like one might expect after seeing movies like Star Wars:The Force Awakens or Finding Dory.
+It's very re-watchable. The jokes always land, the visuals always wow, and the pacing is such that you won't feel bored during ""slow"" moments on subsequent viewings.

Negatives:
-The big reveal will make you wish ""Revilio"" wasn't a spell.
-The subplot of the newspaper owner and his sons doesn't go anywhere. The time spent with those characters could have easily gone to more important plot elements or more beasts.
-Some parts of the wizarding world of America feel illogical or need to be fleshed out better to make sense. Why can ""cops"" order immediate executions of prisoners? Why are American wizards so terrified of non-magical people? Why is so little interest given to the affairs of the wizarding world outside America?

Overall, I would give the movie a 7.5 out of 10. Quite good, a ton of fun, and you'll enjoy watching it numerous times.",1481500800,,2183,4.754617414248021

5938652,5,B005QI4U0W,"This film is in one word: delightful. In a movie world of broad shouldered, spandex clad superheroes, Newt is a breath of fresh air. His awkwardness with all things human, his preference for wool and tweet makes him a welcome change in hero-land. He is surrounded by a cast of other lovable characters. One of the great characters of this movie is the no-mag Jacob Kowalsky an aspiring baker who plants himself firmly in the life of Newt. He is everything that Newt is not: charming with animals as well as people. Talking about Jacob: his musical theme is just as memorable as Hedwigs. Its kind of jazzy and translates the essence of his character in music. Besides Jacob there are the witch sisters Tina, an auror and Queenie, someone who can see, hear or feel minds. Here is my only squabble with this film: female characters are not Rowlings strongpoint. They seem to lack any kind of ambiguity, they are uncreatively good or unimaginatively evil. Interesting thinking, feeling or plot development always seem to happen to men.

That said, the film is delightful in capturing a mood. The real main character are the roaring twenties with it s sense of dread and expectation of the new all at the same time. There is a darkness that seems to inhabit New York but at the same time there is a whimsicality brilliantly imagined in the nightclub scene. There is giggle water, a song about a flying pig and all kind of strange creatures.

Plot wise there are hints, beginnings of what may well become a strong plot. For now we meet the most important characters. The plot revolves around a creature that roames the streets of New York creating havoc where it appears. Is it one of Newt's or are there darker powers at work here? Rowling is a master in creating new imagery for the deeply seated human feelings like fear of the unknown, hatred of the more gifted in short the possibility to hate. On the other hand she shows what can overcome those prejudices: imagination, acceptance of the weird and awkward, a sense of fun and ultimately love (of course). Im excited to see how things turn out.

Is it a film for children? I don't know. Maybe its a bit slow. It certainly is scary. (But h, Im old).",1481241600,2,2198,4.587786259541985

Current edition as of 12/9/2016 is a single DVD box with four thin cardboard sleeves/folders separating the discs. The discs can be tricky to put back in, as it's just pockets in the cardboard folder. Not the best quality but it DOES look nice and it is a space saver. The discs are advertised as All Region, but I haven't had a chance to watch all the videos yet to verify this.

One thing to note: It DOES come with Ultraviolet copies, but they're region-locked for the UK and this is not clarified in the description. After another seller mentioned they had it overridden and directly added to their Ultraviolet library, I reached out to WB's customer service to see if I could get it overridden as well. I'll reach out to UV next if they don't come back with an answer, and edit this review to tell folks who to reach out to get the codes overridden for other regions.

Overall, for the value, getting all 8 movies for this price is fantastic. I picked up mine while it was on sale for $46 and I have absolutely no regrets. As a bonus it comes with the 8-disc documentary ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"", so some nice bonus features there!

Final verdict:
Pros: Excellent value (especially if you get it on sale), space saving packaging, comes with the bonus documentary, all 8 movies, All Region.
Cons: Flimsier packaging, UV codes are not specified as region locked.",1481241600,2,2062,4.514745308310992

5938662,2,B005QI4U0W,"I've never been a fan of the Harry Potter series, but because of its cultural impact, I've acquainted myself somewhat with it.  I thought a different setting and group of characters would be refreshing and decided to check out this movie.  I followed it mostly but found it to be an overall disappointment.  For as many times it does something interesting, it does something illogical, confusing, or contrived.  Eddie Redmayne, who got an Oscar for playing Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, is a fantastic actor, but the movie de-elevates him over time to a supporting role and doesn't allow his whimsical personality to exhibit enough humor except at the beginning.  He arrives in 1920s New York with a case containing fantastic creatures, but after some escape, he has to regain them.  His life intersects with an aspiring baker's named Jacob, whose eagerness and naivete become very funny at several points in the movie.  The beginning and the end have the most humor, mainly because of those two interacting.  The end is also very funny because Jacob creates baked goods which look like the creatures he was exposed to even though he can't remember what had happened.  I mentioned that ""spoiler"" because I know it won't hurt your enjoyment of the ending even if you know it in advance.  The creatures J. K. Rowling envisioned are sometimes hilariously imaginative.

Those are the movie's strengths, but when only about a 5th of the movie is whimsical and interesting, and the rest is some convoluted plot involving terminology which never gets defined for those who aren't already intimately aware of the Harry Potter stuff, the movie is a failure.  This movie is awful as a whole, as everything except the very beginning and end has a poorly explained plot involving someone who's creating an oppressive magical creature which kills a senator.  The senator's purpose in the story is just to be killed, and his father is played by excellent actor Jon Voight, whose talents are wasted in this role which seems unneeded.  J. K. Rowling got way too carried away in writing this movie without thinking about how to make it interesting for someone who doesn't know everything about the Harry Potter terms already.  Every time there's an interesting idea, it gets wasted about a minute later as there's some CGI special effect which has nothing to do with whats already been explained in the story, and then everyone in the movie knows what happened and uses Harry Potter terms but I'm left wondering what's going on.  I later read the Wikipedia plot and understood everything I'd watched, except for the REASON WHY THE TWO VILLAINS WERE INTERESTED IN OVERTHROWING NEW YORK!  Why did they collaborate, and why did they want to overthrow everything?  (Johnny Depp plays one of em in a very brief appearance, which is not surprising.)  If you're going to develop a convoluted plot, you need to explain it better during its development, including the mechanisms by which they fulfill it--instead of rewriting the rules all the time about how magic can help them fulfill their evil goals--and you also need to have the motivations made clear.  This movie also is lousy in that theres almost no humor except at the beginning and end.  J. K. Rowling failed in this movie, and I wish this movie NO SUCCESS AT ALL!",1480896000,5,3315,4.862989323843417

5938664,5,B005QI4U0W,"This is the first film of what is anticipated to be a multiple part film series (at least 5 films). It takes place in NYC circa 1926. Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is in NYC from Britain. He is a collector of ""fantastic beasts"" and is attempting to keep them from extinction and use said creatures to instruct wizards about them. While in NYC he runs into difficulty and finds himself at odds with an Obscurial (a young powerful wizard who use the dark force) and Mr. Graves (Colin Farrell). He allies himself with Tina (Katherine Waterston) clearly a future love interest, Queenie (Alison Sudol) a mind reader who oozes with Luna Lovegood simplicity and a likeable human (Dan Fogler).

There are a few things to note, one is the differences in culture and slang between the US and English wizards. The names lack the astrological significance as the Potter series. The magic words also appear crude and unlike English words made to sound Latin. There is a single reference to Transfiguration Professor Albus Dumbledore. He was famous for his defeat of Gellert Grindelwald. This is part of the background for the film.

On the surface, the film appears to have let loose the special effects people and then create a film around it. Newt Scamander starts off as a low key character devoid of the personality normally associated with Rowling's characters. All this should change with the next film.",1480896000,4,1398,4.845188284518828

5938666,5,B005QI4U0W,"This movie was everything I wanted and needed from a continuation of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world. In fact, it felt like it was a movie not designed for the kiddos now, but the adults who grew up reading Harry's adventures.

And somehow this one wiggled in and became my favorite out of the now 9 wizarding world movies. My favorite. I have a slight theory that Newt is autistic, because throughout the movie I kept thinking of how much his behavior reminds me of my own daughter's. Whether or not it was intentionally written by the author, it enchanted Joi and she was incredibly impressed by him and his creatures.

My only grievance is the slight unlikability of one of the secondary characters, a former auror wanting to slide back into good graces. I had trouble liking her initially but felt she was thoroughly redeemed later.
On the other secondary characters, you have a male who isn't classically beautiful like the others. Eddie Redmayne is an attractive guy *swoon* and so were the female co-stars, but then you've got the Everyman Guy. The Average Joe who actually attracts a hot woman at one point in the film. We need more of that in Hollywood. We need more Everyday Dudes who aren't hunkily busting out of their shirts. Yes, I love a hot Tarzan looking dude any day of the week but I think it behooves Hollywood to give us more people the rest of us can physically relate to in situations we aspire to be in.

If there were clumsy parts, I think they affected me for all of 5 seconds and were forgotten, swept away by the haze of magic. This movie was one beautiful visualization to another, wonderfully choreographed scenes using beasts, and so much magic from skilled adult wizards to make up for the sometimes awkward skill we've experienced through watching Harry grow up.

5938669,4,B005QI4U0W,"A very enjoyable movie. Although I am not a super fan, nor follow this author's books with the Harry Potter franchise, I did never the less liked this film.

  The story in brief (because going into the theater I had no idea what the plot was?): A group of twenty to thirty something adult wizards, who live in the shadows of New York society in the 1920's, try to protect a brief case which is really a secret magical portal into a fantasy neither world zoo where the most spectacular alien like creatures reside.  This fantasy takes place in the same universe as Harry Potter, and places with names are mentioned in this story.

 The special effects and CGI animation in this film is nothing short of spectacular, and I found many of the creature characters like the elf and goblin midget creatures in the background scenes really entertaining to see again.  The wizard priests, and the sorceresses were interesting and the costume with the sets got the 1920's (the economic turbulent inter-war period) down very well. All of it was enjoyable and decent enough for me to recommend the movie.

 Now here is my main complaint, and it is not against the filmmakers but against Hollywood's MPAA rating board.  I want to ask these morons what movie did they watch to give this film a PG-13 rating?? Did they see the same movie I did???  This film is fine for young kids despite a few frightening images, and I think the rating should have honestly been G.

 The MPAA is a major bain on America's pop culture entertainment, for none of their modern ratings really make any sense, for they cater too much to political correctness and to political special interest groups who complain like three year children and in all honesty should be completely ignored.  I urge everyone to use their own rational judgement regarding tv shows and movies, if it is obviously not a kiddie film then do not take your kids to it, but if it is a fine piece of art like this movie then consider taking all the kids, thus just ignore today's movie rating system because today in 2016 it isn't rational anymore.  This movie gets a solid B+, it is much better than I thought it would be, so I was surprised.  Thumbs up.",1480723200,,2192,4.553571428571429
5938670,4,B005QI4U0W,"Two films this month  have restored my faith that its actually possible to make obscenely expensive, special-effects-stuffed blockbusters that are actually good.

Both are lead by unconventional British actors who would look more at home at a library (or comic-book store) than on Muscle Beach.

The first, of course is Doctor Strange, the Marvel box-office marvel led by lanky Sherlock smartypants Benedict Cumberbatch.

As enjoyable as it is, that superhero picture is surpassed in every way by Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, an enchanting new entry in the J.K. Rowling cinematic universe starring equally lanky Eddie Redmayne.

For one thing, Fantastic Beasts actually has a story.

Theres even an honest-to-goodness subtext.

It had better be good: Fantastic Beasts, which follows eight profitable Harry Potter films, was made for a reported budget of $225 million.

Scripted by Rowling and directed by David Yates, who helmed the final four Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts is a spin-off inspired by one of Harry's textbooks, an idiosyncratic guide to magical animals purportedly written by one Newt Scamander.

The film is an origin story of sorts, explaining how the talented globetrotting wizard came to write his book.

And how was that?

By coming to America, of course.

Set during the 1920s, Fantastic Beasts opens with Newts arrival in New York. The Oscar-winning Redmayne plays him to perfection as an awkward, maladroit young wizard who is far more comfortable around animals than people.

Expelled from Hogwarts, he has been a social outcast who travels the globe in search of magical creatures, which he captures and keeps in his suitcase  an awesome magical device that encloses a massive nature preserve.

For the most part, Newt has been left alone.

That changes when some of his pets escape the case.

Yates and Rowling, whose film is propelled by a potent mix of CGI and lyrical romanticism, have buckets of fun with these magical beings. Its clear they delight in their creations.

One of Newts pals is a small, cute, and furry platypuslike dude that is fascinated by things that shine. A terrific early scene in a bank has it darting around stealing coins, rings, necklaces, and pocket watches.

Another beast, a tiny green stick insect that lives in Newts jacket pocket, can pick locks and comes in handy when Newt gets stuck in the banks vault.

Fantastic Beasts has two parallel story lines. In the first, Newt chases down his escaped beasts with help of a motley crew: a working class no-maj (the American word for a Muggle), wonderfully portrayed by Dan Fogler (Barely Lethal), and two comely female wizards, Porpentina ""Tina"" Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) and her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol).

The three actors are part of a marvelous ensemble cast that also includes Colin Farrell, Jon Voight, Samantha Morton, Carmen Ejogo, and Johnny Depp.

The second, darker story is about a series of deadly attacks by an evil magical entity that have all but shut down New York.

Newt is sucked into the struggle when hes arrested by security officers from the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) as the wizard responsible for the terror attacks.

His crime, we find out, comes with the death penalty.

Terror attacks? Security forces? The death penalty?

For better or worse, Fantastic Beasts has a whopper of  a subtext, a blanket critique of American society that continuously rises up from every nook and cranny of the story.

Rowling paints a disturbing, even ugly, picture of America as a violent cauldron of repression and xenophobia ruled by paranoia and fear. Its the era of Prohibition, and people are beset on all sides by self-appointed guardians of morality and patriotism.

This may be a period piece, Rowling suggests, but its really about life in the age of the war on terror, the war on illegal immigration, the war on drugs  and, at least as Rowling sees it, the war on the poor. The New York we see here is controlled by malevolent robber barons and greedy, narcissistic politicians.

Yates and Rowling skillfully weave their bleak  and blunt-edged  message into the fabric of the story. It might be wildly out of place in a fantasy aimed at tweens, but its a welcome change from the usual vapid blockbuster.",1480723200,,4288,5.0028208744710865
5938671,5,B005QI4U0W,"Newt is ridiculously easy to like. Incredibly competent within his own sphere, he's awkward and uncertain everywhere else. (You know how to tell when a nerd likes you? He looks at your shoes when he talks to you.) And, like so many adepts in so many arcane or academic arts, he seems to have no idea what a beginner in his own specialty might not know. Yes, those beasts are harmless - to anyone who's dedicated a lifetime to understanding them and learning how to harness their power.

So, when a few get loose in a 1930-ish New York City, hilarity ensues. But, like all the Potter movies, this has a lot going on. The ever-present shadow of the bad guy (sort of a pre-Voldemort), magic vs. muggle tension, and a non-magical guy way too involved for his own good, they all wind together to give this movie texture. After you see how he becomes part of the plot, I don't think it spoils anything to say the mo-maj (muggle) is a big part of a happy ending.

I'm not a serious Potter fanatic (even though my Best Beloved and I saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Azkaban/dp/B000W745CU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Azkaban</a>&nbsp;as our honeymoon).

5938679,5,B005QI4U0W,"From the moment I heard about J.K. Rowling writing a screenplay inspired by her anthology Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, I was both excited and nervous. Like many others, my childhood and love of reading were fostered by Rowling's incredible Harry Potter series. After the huge commercial and critical success of the 8 Harry Potter films, a spin off of some kind seemed inevitable. Thankfully, Warner Bros. brought most of the filmmakers responsible for those films back to bring Rowling's new story to life. Still, without the success of preexisting source material, Fantastic Beasts was anything but a safe bet.

The film opens with British wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) arriving into 1920's New York City. Armed with a suitcase full of illicit magical creatures, all cleverly hidden from the eyes of Muggles (No-Maj's non magical people are called in America), Newt plans to make his way to Arizona to release one of his beasts. As he walks the streets of New York, he is drawn to a large gathering in front of a bank where a woman from the New Salem Philanthropic Society speaks of the evils of wizards and the need for a re institution of witch hunts.

A bump in with No-Maj man leads to an unintentional switch in suitcases and the eventual escape of many of Newt's animals. With magical creatures running freely through the heavily populated New York, Newt must turn to the assistance of a group of American Wizards and a No-Maj to capture the beasts. Failure to return the creatures to the safety of his suitcase would place Scamander in serious trouble and threaten to expose the entire magical community to a world that is growing less and less tolerant of their existence.

I'll admit to having mixed emotions going into this film. On the one hand, I had faith that Rowling would provide a story that would be a worthy successor to her acclaimed Potter series. At the same time, the announcement of Fantastic Beasts being the start of a five film series had me worried that this franchise would be nothing more than a cash grab. As the movie opened, I feared that my predictions would come true. The mistaken suitcase switch seemed like a rather cliche device that was not worthy of the Potter universe.

Those fears were quickly assuaged as Scamander stepped into the vast expanses of his creature carrying case. The film ends up feeling very different from the Potter story, but equally as magical and engaging. Newt Scamander is a misunderstood outcast who sees good in creatures that most would ignore or run from. Each cast member brilliantly brings their characters to life with skill and great care. For her part, Rowling presents a story that is much more complex and layered than I initially perceived. Fantastic Beasts spins an extraordinary fable of acceptance of differences and the role of politics in the fight for those who may be seen as ""other"". The end of the film provides a satisfying closure to Scamander's story while opening the possibilities to expand the story into what is sure to be a unique franchise. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is easily the most original and exciting blockbuster of the year, and I can't wait to see where Rowling and company will take this story next!",1480550400,,3242,4.794275491949911

But to get there you had to wade almost two hours through an overly complicated plot that plods along at (too many) times, due to scenes that are too long and an uneven performance by its stellar cast.

Too much time was spent hunting for escaped fantastic beasts. And one such scene was absolutely ludicrous. All of these scenes could have been much shorter, pushing the story along a bit quicker. Additionally, two much was given away too early with regard to the fantastic beasts, instead of springing a major surprise at the end that would have been overwhelming. Most of the acting was brilliant, but the female protagonist love interest (Tina  Katherine Waterson) was weak and even stiff - dragging down the story. Two of the secondary characters (Queenie  Alison Sudol and Kowalski  Dan Fogler) were fantastic and added a lot to the movie.  Of course, it was nice seeing big names like Eddie Redmayne (Newt), Colin Farrel (Graves), John Voit (Shaw Senior), Ron Perlman (Gnarlack),  and, of course, Johnny Depp.

5938687,5,B005QI4U0W,"J.K. Rowling may have ended the Harry Potter series, but she isn't done writing about her magical world. Her latest series Fantastic Beasts has finally hit theaters, with the first of what will be a five film series, that starts off a hundred years before Harry Potter stepped into Hogwarts. The film is centered on Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), who has come to New York City as part of his quest to save the endangered species of the magical world. These creatures live in what appears to be a suitcase, but when some of them escape and a muggle is exposed to Scamander's attempts to retrieve them, he finds himself in a world of trouble. Scamander's only salvation is that with another unknown creature and a dark wizard on the loose, there are other things to worry about, so he is sent with an agent (Katherine Waterston), and the muggle, to collect his creatures and to try to help figure out what is going on. Even though this movie takes place a hundred years before Harry Potter the special effects and especially the CGI on all the creatures involved is amazing! Even if I watched this film without the sound on, I'd still be blown away by how visually impactful it is. As for it's star, they cast one of the biggest up and comers in Hollywood, Eddie Redmayne, and he is perfect for the role. Redmayne is exactly like Harry and the kind of character Rowling loves to write about. He's this geeky, skinny, soft spoken, lovable loser, that no one would expect to be perhaps a hero in waiting. Aside from some corny jokes thrown in for the kids and die hard Potter fans, this movie was absolutely fantastic and I can't wait to see where it goes next. Rowling has stated that the other films will focus on other characters, including a younger Dumbledore, which I'm a bit indifferent to. I really liked this film, and I am curious to know what would be the point in a sequel that starts over. I'd imagine it would be to introduce everyone and then bring them all together in the end, but no matter what they do, the producers will be hard pressed to out due this film.",1480291200,3,2076,4.480211081794195

5938695,4,B005QI4U0W,"""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them"" is great. This is how the story goes: The year is 1926 and Newt Scamander has just completed a global excursion to find and document an extraordinary array of magical creatures. Arriving in New York for a brief stopover, he might have come and gone without incident...were it not for a No-Maj (American for Muggle) named Jacob, a misplaced magical case, and the escape of some of Newt's fantastic beasts, which could spell trouble for both the wizarding and No-Maj worlds.

The cast led by Eddie Redmayne (solid as usual as Newt Scamander) is great. The directing by David Yates is great. The story & screenplay by J.K. Rowling (who also produced) is great.

The music by James Newton Howard is great. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is great. The film editing by Mark Day is great. The casting by Fiona Weir is great. The production design by Stuart Craig is great. The art direction by David Allday, Guy Bradley, Toby Britton, Peter Dorme, Gavin Fitch, Martin Foley & Hayley Easton Street is great. The set decoration by Anna Pinnock is great. The costume design by Colleen Atwood is great. The make-up design by Fae Hammond is great. The special effects coordinated by Victoria Cadiou and designed by Jason Marsh is great. The visual effects coordinated by Sam Ashford-Rowe, Marie-Pier Barrette, Teresa Berus, Aleksandra Bjelica, Ann-Marie Blommaert, Sara Bourque, Zaira Brilhante, Daniel Charchuk, Lucy & Natalie Cooke, Paul Docherty, Izzy Field, James Fouche, Thibaud Galbois, Sam Girdler, Louis-Charles Lapointe, Virginie Lavalle, Ethan Maharaj, Julie-Ann Marks, Zoe Medcraft, Daniel Moody, Laurie Pellard, Vishal Rustgi, Kasey Simpson, Kath Smith, Josh Sykes, Nancy Xu and James Yeoman & supervised by Arnaud Brisebois, Tim Burke, Ferran Domenech, Anthony Dunifer, Nicolas Hernandez, Andy Kind, Christian Manz, Andrew Morley, Stephane Naze, Olcun Tan & Ben White is great. The stunts coordinated by Ami Verge is great.

This is a great, solidly-crafted film that is entertaining and well-done. Eddie Redmayne is solid as usual as Newt Scamander and his supporting cast led by Katherine Waterston (as Tina) is just as solid as he is. David Yates has directed another great film to his resume. J.K. Rowling has written a solidly-crafted first screenplay. This is one of the better films of the year and also one of the better films of the holiday season, as well, too.",1480118400,,2424,5.116161616161616
5938696,3,B005QI4U0W,"A socially clumsy English mage by the name of Newt arrives in New York carrying a magical suitcase that contains numerous fantastic animal, which includes a kleptomaniac platypus. His aim is to restore some of them back to the wild in Arizona since he obtained them from traffickers. Some of them get loose and he's trying to recapture them, but comes into trouble with the local association of witches/magicians. He teams up with a chap that only wants to establish a bakery and a witch that has been demoted within the agency. Meanwhile, bad (magical) things are happening in New York independent of Newt and his wayward menagerie.

Good acting and good special effects, so why only 3 stars? I just couldn't force myself to care for any of the characters except for the well meaning baker. There was something missing. One scene in particular made me cringe. It's when Newt tries to recapture a rhinoceros-like creature which is in heat. The whole scene was pathetic.

A couple of good points: Jon Voigt makes an appearance (we see to little of him in movies), and, Rowling continues to lambast the lying, hypocritical media, something she started in the Harry Potter movies.",1480032000,4,1177,4.850746268656716
5938697,4,B005QI4U0W,"For those who like Harry Potter, you really can't go wrong with this one. This is the perfect way to bring back this franchise, by making the film about new characters in a new story, we get to return to this wonderful world while Harry's legacy get's to be left alone.(No, I have no interest in The Cursed Child.)
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS BY THE WAY!
Was the film perfect, no. All the Grindelwald stuff was interesting and I'm excited to see more of him, but I actually would have appreciated more set up as strange as that sounds. I loved seeing Johnny Depp at the end, but I would have liked to understand a bit more of, say, why has he been dressing up as Colin Farrell all this time and infiltrating the Ministry(or whatever they call it) all this time? I'm sure there's a good explanation(maybe he was just after the kid or something), but we'll have to wait.  This film actually works fine as a stand alone movie which is fine yet odd seeing how their planning four sequels. Then again, Sorcerers Stone pretty much did the same thing.
Also, where the hell were Jacob and Queenie during the final battle? She was going to help her sister but then Jacob asks to come with but she says he can't but then Jacob says he should and then she puts her hand on his face and it appears that she's thinking...... and then we don't see either of them again until after all the fightings over........... That's weird man.
The film doesn't quite rank with the best of the Potter franchise but, as a film that has to set up so much new stuff, I wasn't really expecting it to.(I had hope though.)
I'm being way to hard on this film because truth is, I thought it was great. I kind of loved it.
I really enjoyed our four new protagonists. Each of them is a totally different character that contributes to the team. Are Newt, Tina, Jacob and Queenie the next Harry, Ron and Hermione? Not yet, but it's only been one film and I'm very excited to see these characters grow and see their relationships deepen over the next four films. Maybe we can see a deeper friendship between Newt and Queenie as well as, actually I just realized, Tina and Jacob really don't have much interaction in this film at all. Not on a personal level at least. Yeah, I definitely want to see more of a friendship between them in the next four films.
The Jacob/Queenie romance was nice, at least once they actually start to know each other and it moves on from pure attraction.
I have to say though, the Newt/Tina romance has to be one of the most believable movie romances i've seen in years. Compelling stuff.
Newt is a great lead character, always extremely selfless and caring. Tina is really strong and determined but never losing track of what is really important. Jacob is just your average guy thrust into this crazy wizerding world but he steps up to the plate with true bravery. When we meet Queenie she is pretty much just really flirty but she definitely becomes a lot more three demential as the film goes on. Not to mention she launches what might just be this years most thrilling prison break.
Eddie Redmayne, Kathrine Waterston, Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol are all fantastic and I'm very excited to see them grow into their roles even further just like Danial Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson did in what feels like so many years ago.
On the flip side, I'm really excited for Grindelwald as a villain. Graves/Grindelwald is just such a cool villain. He's interesting too. Is he the next Voldemort? Not yet, but with Johnny Depp in the Harry Potter Universe, under David Yates' direction, the potential is endless!
David Yates returning to direct is a big part of why I was so excited about this movie and he does not disappoint! He does a great job setting things up in the first half of the film but once the action starts rolling in the second half, forget it, you are in for one of the best rides of the year!
J.K.Rowling doesn't disappoint with the script either!
James Newton Howard composes a musical score that is everything it needs to be: memorable!
The Credence plot twist was solid and unexpected!
Lastly, David Yates keeps the nostalgia coming despite the completely new characters, setting and story! I particularly loved what I think was a giant Pensieve during the scene when their about to execute Tina. Also, 5 years ago I sat down in a theater to see ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" and I thought to myself ""Wow. Last time ever I'll get to see the camera float through the Warner Bros logo followed by a silver title to come floating through."" It just comes to show you never know what the future holds!
Anyway, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was fantastic! It does everything it needs to to honor the legacy of the originals while setting up a series of it's own and I truly cannot wait for what's to come!",1480032000,8,4820,4.489749430523918

5938700,4,B005QI4U0W,"(I rate this film 3.5 stars, generally good but as not as good as the original HP films.) Francis Ford Coppola once said that to make a film work, a filmmaker should be able to sum up the entire film in a single word or phrase. (He defined his epic ""The Godfather"" as ""succession"".) In ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"", I wasn't quite sure of the main focus of the film, in other words I couldn't find a single phrase to sum to up what the story was about. Hence the film moves in many different directions, and while there is much to praise in the film, the screenplay was in need of a few more rewrites. At first the main focus seemed to be ""save the beasts"" but later it became ""stop the Obscurus"". Even by film's end, I wasn't entire convinced how these two ideas related to each other.

Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a Hogwarts graduate and scholar of fantastic beasts of sorts, arrives in New York. Scamander's character seems literally a cross between Harry Potter and renowned physicist Stephen Hawking (whom Redmayne played in the 2014 film ""The Theory of Everything""). He's been engaged in a long quest to stop the highest officials of the magic world from exterminating the many magical beasts which infiltrate the magic world. The political body in America has been concerned that sometimes these beasts slip into the muggle (non-magic) world, and they are dedicated to ensure the muggle world never become privy to the magic world. Newt has brought with him a special ""case"" which contains many of these magical beasts, sort of like the magical equivalent of Noah's Ark.

Scamander crosses paths with Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), a lovable nobody muggle/no-maj who simply desires to create a bakery in the city. He is going to one of the local banks to plead for a loan, and he also carries a case similar in size, color and design to that being held by Scamander, although his is simply filled with samples of his pastries. Through several happenstance encounters causing several of Newt's beasts to escape into the muggle world, Jacob and Newt become reluctant bedfellows, so-to-speak, as Jacob is introduced to the magic world before he can be ""obliviated"", the magic world's term for erasing muggles' memories of magic encounters. Newt is then arrested by Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), an agent of the Ministry of Magic, Auror division, which enforces the strict law of magic, which includes keeping muggles ignorant of the presence of magic people. They also meet Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol), Tina's roommate who takes a liking to Jacob.

Simultaneously, the city is being ravaged by an unseen ""force"" which seems to have supernatural qualities and inclinations. This thing enjoys chewing up buildings and streets and then spitting them into rubble. An anti-witch/anti-magic group run by Mary Lou Barebone is making street speeches that ""something"" is invading their city, preaching on a soap box a little bit like Aimee Semple McPherson of the Pentecostal movement in Los Angeles in the early 20th century. She seems to be aware of the presence of ""magic people"" and fantastic beasts in her midst. She also runs an orphanage and ""cares"" for several children: Credence, Chastity, and Modesty. The eldest, a young man, is Credence who wears funereal clothing and acts and appears to be constantly troubled. At one point, the Barebone ""family"" (if family they can be called) enter one of the local newspapers asking the editor Henry Shaw, Sr. (Jon Voight) to look into the matter. He refuses the request. Credence is then befriended by someone in the magic world: Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), one of the top officials in the Ministry of Magic in America. Graves promises Credence he will become ""welcome"" in the magic world if the younger man helps him to find the dark force, called an obscurus; Graves is convinced the force is someone in the Barebone orphanage.

The story then moves basically on three fronts: Newt dealing with his escaped magical creatures, the anti-magic society among whom Credence has befriended a wizard and Ministry of Magic official, and the strange dark ""force"" which runs rampant through the city, smashing up the metropolis into the equivalent of Dresden during the Second World War. While these different ideas do finally converge by film's end, much of how all the pieces fit was very confusing. Some of the sequences where Newt was chasing escaped beasts, trying to get them back into his case, went on for too long. One good sequence, which is I think Rowling's strength, is when Newt introduces Jacob to his menagerie of beasts inside his case.

Overall, generally a good film, but it needed to be tightened more. The Harry Potter films were much better focused while this film seemed a bit ""all over the place"". Personally, the first 1/2 hour and the last 1/2 hour were the most interesting. Some parts of the middle hour were often perplexing. I liked the acting of all the leads, although sometimes Newt (Redmayne) was a bit difficult to hear, and he would move his head somewhat away from the camera. When he describes the dark force ""the obscurus"", he was somewhat enigmatic in his explanation. Maybe I wanted a flashback to see the creation of the obscurus and what it was about rather than the endless ""lets get the creature"" before the muggles find out sequences. Still, generally it holds together, but it was close to a misfire.",1479859200,,5419,4.866738894907909
5938701,4,B005QI4U0W,"The Harry Potter franchise was far too massive (and profitable) to be allowed to just end. Fortunately, any good fantasy world has the scope for more stories to be told.

And this brings us ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"" based (using the term loosely) on a pamphlet-sized ""textbook"" on magical creatures written by J. K. Rowling. This first movie in a new pentalogy is a fairly solid adventure set in 1920s New York -- there are a few tenuous connections to the previous Potter stories, but otherwise this is its own tale of whimsical creatures, political oppression and big swoopy dark cloud things.

Magical zoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) arrives in New York with a magical suitcase filled with strange and wondrous creatures, which he hopes to educate his fellow wizards about. But he runs into trouble almost as soon as he lands -- he runs afoul of a stern MACUSA agent named Tina (Katherine Waterston), and his briefcase is accidentally taken by a No-Maj (aka Muggle) named Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler). When Jacob opens the suitcase, dozens of magical creatures stream out and begin running wild across the city.

So Newt begins trying to recapture all his escaped creatures, with the assistance of the amazed Jacob, who had never dreamed that witches, wizards and fantastic beasts could exist. But it so happens that a dark and terrible force is sweeping through New York, brutally killing a senator during a political rally. And unfortunately, the American wizard authorities -- led by Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) -- immediately blame Newt, forcing the unworldly animal-collector to try to find the true source of all this mayhem.

""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" is a movie more for people who love the overall universe of the Harry Potter series than the specific characters. There are a few familiar surnames, a mention of Dumbledore and Hogwarts, but for the most part it has a cast of all-new characters, a different setting and a different time period.... which, oddly, makes it easier for noobs to get acquainted with its universe. Since Jacob Kowalski is learning about the wizarding world and how it works, new viewers can come along for the ride.

The movie is a pretty colorful and energetic affair, with lots of wild action scenes where Newt tries to recapture one of his exotic creatures (including a wild ice-skating escapade, and a slow-mo scene involving a cockroach and a teapot), often with some wacky banter (""But why would I have to wear something like this?"" ""Because your skull is susceptible to breakage under immense force!""). And the fantastic beasts of the title are pretty entertaining in their own right -- while they couldn't carry a movie themselves, the weird and exotic creatures (tentacled quadrupeds, the ""Swooping Evil,"" leaf-like little creatures, serpent-birds hatched from silver eggs) add a magical tinge to the New York setting.

But it also has a distinctly dark undertone, both magically and politically. The American wizard civilization is a pretty dark and iron-fisted bunch, apparently not hesitating to immediately kill those it sees as being potential breakers of the Masquerade, and is countered by a bunch of religious fanatics obsessed with killing witches. And the underlying story is about an out-of-control dark magical energy that seems to swoop in and kill without warning, and a dark wizard is interested in controlling it.

It also has a pretty solid cast -- Eddie Redmayne plays Newt's socially-awkward nerdery with the perfect combo of absent-mindedness and fierce compassion, and he's balanced out beautifully by the brittle, desperate Waterston, Alison Sudol as the sweet telepathic Queernie, and especially as the first Muggle main character, wide-eyed, good-hearted Fogle. This character's earnestness and dreams of owning a bakery will melt your heart. The one performance that doesn't quite click is Farrell -- he's not bad, but he feels strangely remote and subdued, though admittedly that might be on purpose.

""Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them"" is a solid little period fantasy movie -- fans will enjoy a new perspective on the Harry Potter universe, and newcomers might find it a good gateway. And of course, this is just the start.",1479772800,115,4252,5.09038737446198
5938702,1,B005QI4U0W,"This movie is grossly inconsistent with what is in the Harry Potter novels and the original Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them book. What happened in this movie was so huge it would have been taught at Hogwarts. It would have been in the Harry Potter novels. And calling muggles non magi in this movie? Does JK Rowling really expect anyone to swallow that crap? Slight changes from a book to a movie is to be expected, but this is ridiculous. I am stunned that JK Rowling wrote the screenplay for this movie, it is trash. I spent 133 minutes watching this crap which is 133 minutes wasted. This movie is an insult to all the people who love the Harry Potter novles. Clearly JK Rowling has no respect for the true fans of the Harry Potter novels, because if she did, she would not have written this piece of crap. Surely she could have picked somewhere better than America to set this movie. I mean, really? America? The land of hillbilly bogans? I thought JK Rowling had more class than that. After all, she insisted that all the actors in the Harry Potter movies had to be from the UK. This movie is a total waste of money, don't buy it. It doesn't deserve even one star.",1479772800,2,1177,4.378995433789954
5938703,5,B005QI4U0W,"This in my opinion starts off stronger than the harry potter films did. It kinda jumps into the action and storyline right away in the movie. Now don't get me wrong, the harry potter movies are one of the best movie franchises ever and remain one of my many favorites. But they don't jump into action until more towards the middle of the movie. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them on the other hand does this right away and remains action filled and interesting from start to end. Another reason why this movie is very good is because it has lots of funny lines. It did surprise me when i seen it, because i wasn't expecting it to be funny.
  Now until you see the movie, you do not know any background to any of these characters or who most of the characters are. Unlike the Harry Potter movies where fans new pretty much every detail on the characters there was to know. And i think it just adds to the interesting aspect of the movie where you have no clue what is going to happen next. And other than the field guide J.K. Rowling wrote in 2001, you don't have any idea about the movie and you don't really have anything to compare it too. So you cant say the book was better than the movie.
  Now this is my new absolute favorite movie and if i could, i would give it 100 stars. I recommend you go watch it in the theater if you haven't already. I did the day it premiered and it is the best movie i seen in the theater this year. And i have seen atleast 7 other movies in the theater this year. I am planning to buy this the second it is available on amazon or dvd. BEST MOVIE EVER!",1479686400,,1591,4.13915857605178
5938704,4,B005QI4U0W,"Even J.K. Rowling (""Harry Potter"") isn't above milking a franchise, although she is said to be richer than the Queen of England these days! I suspect creative people just keep creating even when they don't need the cash.

Director David Yates (""Harry Potter"") brings us a fantasy/adventure that places us, once again, in Rowling-land, this time in 1926. Meticulously crafted special effects abound and our familiarity with the Potter saga helps only a bit, as we follow a gentleman into New York's secret world of witches and wizards 70 years before the Potter story starts. An evil force is causing no end of destruction and he wants to help. It's sort of a dark window with eyes.

Part of the enormous cast:

  * Eddie Redmayne (""The Danish Girl"") is Newt Scamander, the aforementioned gentleman traveling to New York. Take a look at his traveling bag: Mary Poppins hasn't a thing on him! Redmayne has devised a stance and a walk that is unique to Newt. It's sort of hollow-chested and listing to the left.
  * Katherine Waterston (""Inherent Vice"") Tina spots Newt as soon as he gets off the boat. It's clear that she knows far more about wizards than most of the New Yorkers who crowd the streets.
  * Dan Fogler (""The Goldbergs"") Cannery worker Kowalski wants to open a bakery but doesn't have any collateral. You know how well that goes over with a banker!
  * Alison Sudol (""Other People's Children"") Queenie loves to cook so she thinks Kowalski is the perfect man. She makes an amazing apple strudel for him.
  * Colin Farrell (""True Detective"") is Percival Graves, a powerful wizard who crosses wands with Newt. Fearsome opponents, indeed!
  * Carmen Ejogo (""Selma"") Seraphina is in charge. The No-Maj (American for Muggles) must have their memories of recent events erased. Period!
  * Ezra Miller (""Suicide Squad"") Credence is part of the cadre of operatives directed by Graves.
  * Samantha Morton (""Max & Ruby"") Mary Lou ""adopts"" children for their own good. Yikes! Her ministry opposes witches and warlocks.
  * Johnny Depp (""Black Mass"") Ha! You'll never recognize his Grindenwald so I'll tell you right now. Yeah, that's a spoiler, but you will STILL be surprised.

As you might expect with a Rowling story, our hold on reality is pretty flimsy but Redmayne manages to find humor in being a stranger in a strange land... Actually, our hold on a plot is equally flimsy. This is mainly an excuse to string together one mind-boggling special effect after another. I sort of liked the first critter that escaped from Newt's grip. It is a sort of duck-billed platypus and is elusive as heck; it LOVES shiny jewelry and valuable coins. Bowtruckle is a green walking-stick bug with attachment issues and the amorous Eruptamus is no shrinking violet!

This is PG-13, so there is no sex (to the Eruptamus's frustration!), a few paltry gunshots, destructive mayhem in the streets but no profanity. The beasts are creative and of course the requisite barroom scene is full of oddball creatures.",1479686400,,2998,4.858267716535433
5938705,4,B005QI4U0W,"Theater review.  Possible spoilers.  For those who need more Harry Potter films, how about some prequels, starting with this opening adventure.  David Yates, who successfully directed a quartet of Potter films, returns as J. K. Rowlings visual story teller.  Set in 1926, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a former student at Hogwarts arrives in New York with a satchel full of funny creatures not found in zoos or in the wild.  He wants to get to Arizona in order to release a giant eagle-like Thunderbird to its rightful inhabitant.

When Newt first arrives, a funky looking miniature platypus-like animal called a Niffler escapes.  Hes attracted to shinny things and is hard to catch.  In fact he becomes more annoying than cute for my taste, but attempts to capture him drive the story.  Newt arrives in New York at a time when unexplained acts of destruction are occurring.  Mostly toppling of walls of buildings.  Newts magic wand spinning is eyeballed by Tina (Katherine Waterston), an agent of the Magical Congress of the United States of America.  Caught in the confusion of trying to capture the Niffler is Jacob (Dan Fogler), a baker trying to get a bank loan.  In America, normal humans like Jacob are called a NoMaj rather than Muggle in the U.K., so while he sees things he cant explain his memory will eventually be wiped.

Tina buddies up to Newt and along with Jacob are introduced to her mind-reading sister, Queenie (Alison Sudol).  Jacob and Queenie flirt while the seemingly shy Newt and Tina remain mostly business like.  MCOTUSA is run by Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo) and her right hand man, Percival Graves (Colin Farrell).  They are trying to track down who or what is creating the embarrassing destruction that is causing humans to get suspicious.  The NoMajs are being riled up by a witch hater named Mary Lou (an authoritarian Samantha Morton) and her children, the oldest of which is Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller).

In addition to finding out who is causing the chaos in New York, the magicians are also trying to figure out what happened to the evil dark wizard of Europe known as Gellert Grindewald who has gone into hiding.  Then there is the expanding ball of black evil that appears to be magic gone amuck and its capture seems to be the primary focus of Graves.  As far as the special effects, well if youve seen one part of town being destroyed in movies, youve seen them all.  So not much special there.  But, the animals are cute, colorful and hard to deal with.  A favorite scene involves Jacob being the amorous target of a creature that looks like a cross between a rhino and a headlamp.

Needless to say, there is a lot going on here and I will admit to being occasionally confused, but never to the point of disappointment.  Im sure much of the missing pieces will be filled in with the next 4 installments.  Recommended.",1479686400,,2870,4.745454545454545

Cast is excellent, action if fast, color is brilliant-dazzling but with a dirty tinge that keeps with the retro period needs. It reminded me of many period films that have proved to be great classic works. I expect this to become one to sit on the shelf beside those others.

Much could be said about many of the cast, but I personally have to single out Eddie Redmayne that I fell in like with while watching his acting and hearing his voice in Les Mis. Here he plays Newt Scamander, odd name but interesting role. He bounces off of Katherine Waterston quite well, she also very capable.
Sure, Potter fans will attend and buy the DVD, but I believe this is not a Harry Potter but a Fantastic Beasts a brute and creature of its own, and it will soar on wings like eagles.",1479600000,5,1206,4.408071748878924

5938711,4,B005QI4U0W,"well the movie starts out kind of slow and the main character I really don't know what to think of him.  Kind of arrogant but also a little corky.  The plot is a little off for the first half of the movie.  Something just didn't feel natural about it, like the story just didn't jell right.  The end if predictable of course and the relationship between the characters seemed to flow better going in to the final scenes.
I did like the realism of the scenary and period of the film.  The main character just seem to be very likeable maybe?  hard to say maybe just not the right person for the role?
I will be optimistic that the next 4 will have a better rapport and flow to it.

5938712,2,B005QI4U0W,"Im not quite sure what to make of this newest cinematic expansion of the Wizarding World. In one part, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them feels like a kids movie with its majestic use of magic. In another part, its marketing and rating suggests a teen movie. Yet at the same time, its 1920s setting and cast of adult characters suggests something that would appeal best to whomever grew up with the original Harry Potter adventures. Well one thing is for sure, this new adaptation by the immortal J.K. Rowling is not going to appeal to anybody in the long-run.

If anything, Fantastic Beasts seems the most like an adventure for the teenage girl, as the very casting of Eddie Redmayne (The Danish Girl, The Theory of Everything) will satisfy their fantasies with his boyish charm, along with a half-baked romance between a down-on-his-luck baker and a zesty accountant. But even so, I doubt any high school cheerleaders would be screaming their heads off over a film focused on combining the roaring twenties with a childrens imagination.

Yet true to what the world of Harry Potter has always done, this historical setting is rich with culture. It turns out that unlike the United Kingdom, America has a different word for muggles; No-Mags, and their relationships align much closer to the Salem witch trials than simple racism. The two worlds between the wizards and No-Mags each look as captivating as they do true to the historical era, complete with a scandalous goblin singing at a bar.

Then in comes skimpy old Newt Scamander, played by the same British actor I previously mentioned. He arrives in New York City on the Fort Elizabeth, with a secret mission involving his magical briefcase. Just step inside his case, and you will see an immense world inside: room upon room housing some of the most fascinating beasts you will find. These include leafy little bowtruckles, a money-mad niffler, a mischievous demiguise, and a size-shifting occamy. Kids will love seeing these imaginative designs, but what they're doing in a PG-13 movie I cannot say.

Teens would certainly not care about seeing these beasts anyway, as the special effects used to bring them to life is distractingly awful. Remember in the Harry Potter movies when computer generated imagery was only used when necessary? Now here, it is use in practically every frame for every scenario, even in places where makeup prosthetics would have gotten the job done easy. Think the entire Hobbit trilogy, except without any effort by the visual effects team.

These beasts have ended up under the hands of a No-Mag named Mr. Kowalski who has dreams of starting his own bakery. Yet he mistakenly lets the case open, and several of the beasts lose into the city. Now Newt has to bring him as a witness to protect his innocence from the National Astute of Secrecy, or else face serious criminal penalty for exposing the wizarding community to the No-Mags.

There are points here and there that reveal how a great movie could have been made, but for the greater portion, the blank performances by the majority of the cast send a preposterous message that says the law and government should not control us.  If you ask me, these negative, limiting depictions of political authorities is way too common in our movie theaters, and our leaders deserve better treatment. Even worse, this predictable story is ruined all the more by a plot twist that adds nothing; literally nothing to the story.

Yet it doesnt stop there. After a snore-inducing climax, the final moments try to emotionally manipulate you as if the filmmakers felt that they earned it somehowthey didnt. Then they of course have to leave the final frame open for a sequel which I obviously will not be looking forward to.

If you think that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a dream come true for your inner witch or wizard, I hate to break it to you: look elsewhere. This attempt at keeping the franchise alive and fresh is only making it age all the more, and its attempted relational bonds between America and England does not feel any stronger either. I could really use a great motion picture that makes us people feel united in spite of differences in a world that wants us to feel otherwise, and this does not accomplish that.",1479513600,2,4273,4.802721088435374
5938713,3,B005QI4U0W,"Filled with wonderful special effects, memorable beasts and some excellent casting, the movie still manages to disappoint slightly due to an immature script and a wandering feeling. When the movie tries to transition away from the presentation of Newt's interesting companions to the movie's central dilemma, I found myself completely indifferent to the outcome, and, indeed, wished the movie had concentrated more on Newt's adventures to find/protect the beasts (in fact, the title of the film appears inappropriate: the movie really has nothing to do with finding fantastic beasts, since the beasts have already been found by the time the movie begins). Nonetheless, the movie is worth seeing for Potter fans--but I will probably not pay to see future installments in the theatre on opening weekend.

Generally, I was left with the impression that wonderful novelists do not necessarily make wonderful screenwriters, and that this movie would have been much more interesting had it benefited from more development. Having seen this, it is extremely difficult to imagine that there are four more films in the works base on this debut.",1479513600,6,1135,5.305555555555555
5938714,4,B005QI4U0W,"Harry Potter fans will of course devour this and it is clearly designed to appeal to this group. For those others of us there is still a lot to like about Fantastic Beasts. It is visually spectacular; the beasts themselves, the magic, the marvelous recreation of New York 1926 - all of this works perfectly and ensures a thrilling treat. Redmayne is classically the eccentric, lovable hero, both bumbling and brilliant. The film is also a fine morality tale about conservation and respect for all creatures. That said, there are some problematic elements. The film rightly raises questions of power and responsibility, but does little to engage with these. It does seem to endorse a hierarchical order based on birth and the concentration of power in the hands of a small, answerable to no-one elite. Rowling's plotting is at times random and the story's 'resolution' is too glib. Notions of good and evil are alarmingly simplistic. The use of magic is bizarrely inconsistent. But this is the Potter universe, with its rules and protocols understood and viewers who are comfortable in this world will find much to enjoy. Indeed, Newt Scamander is a worthy rival to Harry and his colleagues and away from the stifling confines of the Potter stories, there is a refreshing panache about this film that appeals to a wider audience. At same time, viewers who enjoyed Dr Strange are likely to find Fantastic Beasts engaging, even comparable, but ultimately lightweight. As Fantastic Beasts reached it's finale I also saw echoes of Dr Strange.",1479427200,2,1537,4.98443579766537

Eccentric magizoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) misplaces an enchanted suitcase in 1920s New York. An extremely profitable franchise is unleashed.

What did I think?

Hey, you guys like Harry Potter? Then Ive got good news: Fantastic Beasts is the worthy spin-off that you're going to be really into for the next ten years or so. While its darker than the original films, its packed with subtle little nods to them that fans will adore, and the story (though somewhat complicated) is good enough to stand alone. Its tremendous fun to see the wizarding world through a 1920s lens  magical speakeasy, anyone?  and the inhabitants of Scamanders Pokeball-meets-TARDIS suitcase are just as fantastic as advertised. This film will frighten young children, but everyone else will be thoroughly enchanted.",1479427200,141,822,5.292307692307692
5938717,5,B005QI4U0W,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
 Harry Potter does not appear in this film of magic and mayhem.  His birth happens some 70 years after the events shown in 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'.  We are instructed that this is not a prequel to the Potter films but rather a separate story-stories rather as the producers plan five films in this run.  Oh boy.  I loved the Potter films and considered them to be excellent movie fare-still do for that matter.
 And director David Yates handled the last four Potter movies, so he knows what works in this magical universe.  He also has already been tapped to direct all five of the Fantastic films.  In terms of box office, he has one of the most successful runs ever with an average of $280 million including every film he has directed.
 First time script writer J.K. Rowling comes with high expectations.  She of course wrote the original Potter books as well as 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'.  As the inventor of the magical world we can count on her to translate her own vision to the big screen, perhaps better than anyone else could.  She, by the way, became the first author in the history of the world to become a billionaire from her writing, proving that people like her stuff.
 London born Oscar nominee and Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne plays the leading man, Newt Scamander.  Oddly enough he tried for a role in the 2002 film 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' but after reading a single line was dismissed.
 Also appearing are Colin Farrell in a major supporting role and the always lively  Johnny Depp in a brief cameo.  John Voight and Ron Perlman also appear.  Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol play sisters who help New Scamander round up his beasts.  Dan Fogler plays a non-magical baker who also helps out.
 In the story Newt Scamder (Eddie Redmayne) arrives in New York City after girdling the globe in a quest to find and record the said Fantastic Beasts.  He is an ecologist of sorts.  Misadventure allows some of the very dangerous magical critters to get loose among the good folk of NY City.  But writer Rowling will not let things go so simply.  We have a much more dangerous sub story that involves very sinister forces indeed.
 We have lots of magic, some wizard duels and a little romance along with everything else.  This four saw blade film carries a mild PG-13 rating and runs for a good long two hours and13 minutes.  With a budget of $180 million the producers expect 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'  people all around the world to buy lots of tickets, and they surely will.
 Historical movie note- In the 2004 film 'The Prisoner of Azkaban' Harry Potter has a magical map.  On the map is inscribed the name Newt Samander.  How about that?  Rowling plays the long game.",1479427200,46,2792,4.589068825910931
5938718,4,B005QI4U0W,"The film is magical and ""Fantastic"" despite being over-stuffed and draggy with not so great pacing. The chemistry between Dan Fogler and Alison Sudol is what totally won me over though.
Fogler who usually plays the same loud mouth friend in comedies, really shines here as a muggle dragged into the magical world. However Sudol's Queenie who can read minds probably gives the most magical performance in the movie.
Anyone whining that the film isn't exactly what they wanted, I don't understand. The film is a magical delight, what else did you expect it to be ? Not everything worked together I admit though. Some characters, like the Jon Voight one  felt like they were shoved into the story for no good reason. Same with the subplot of Colin Farrell looking for someone special with powers.
None of the heroes will make you forget Harry, Hermione or Ron but they were likeable and to me the heart of the movie. Even more so than the charm of Eddie Redmayne looking for cute magical creatures that escaped. The moments between Fogler and Sudol in the end is what made me tear up and even now writing about it lol. I really loved that relationship.",1479427200,2,1149,4.6600985221674875

5938825,5,B005QI4U0W,"I love the Potter movies and I've been meaning to update my old full screen DVD collection of the movies to some good Blu Rays. When i saw there were new covers and disks coming out I of course waited for weeks so I could specifically order it. When this boxed set originally came out it was only available in the UK, so I had to order it from there. It took about two weeks to come, and in that time it became available on the US amazon site. What's funny is even after international shipping, the cost of this exact same boxed set was much cheaper off the Amazon.co.uk site. (It was approximately $57 american dollars). The only reason to pay the $84 for this boxed set on this version of the site is if you want it in two days, otherwise save yourself some money and order it off of amazons UK sister site.

Anyway, onto the actual set. The boxed set is super nice, and comes in a nice box (with a cheapie cardboard cover to keep the DVD sleeves in) with several book like cardboard sleeves inside that contain the movies and bonus disks. The movies are all very uniform (something I LOVE). If you're not careful it's easy for the movies to slip out of the cardboard sleeves though, but as long as you don't hang them upside down you should be fine.

The set also comes with Ultraviolet copies, but I had trouble redeeming them because of territory issues and had to contact customer service to have them override the issue and have them put the movies directly in my Ultraviolet library.",1470787200,172,1491,4.359712230215828

Instead of Soccerers Stone is Philosophers Stone. (I think it's way cool) HOWEVER, I was finally able to get to Deathly Hallows and NEITHER work. I'm pretty disappointed as the Deathly Hallows is my favorite one. I did not have any issues with any of the other discs just DH.

5938903,5,B005QI4U0W,"Ok so I need to do a little of admitting to the world. I am a complete utter nerd and I am proud of it. I was introduced to the wonderful world of Hogwarts years and years ago and I have never stopped. I have dreamed of being a wizard and all the cool things that I could do if I was ever allowed in that world. But since I know that is never gonna happen this is going to be the closest that I am ever going to get to being a student at Hogwarts and being best friends with Ron and Hermoine.

  I love all these movies and have seen them all in the movie theater ( some more than once.) So when me and my husband have a little bit of time to spare we are usually spending it watching Harry and his friends battle Voldemort or as most call his he who shall not be named. We loved to travel through all the years that Harry and his friends have had all these adventures and get lost in all of it. Did I mention that my husband is as much of a nerd as I am? This box set has already been watched twice since we got it and soon it will be on time 3. These movies make me and my beloved husband run through all the gambit of emotion, including anger, sadness and happiness. We are still trying to figure out what we did before we bought this box set. Now onto more Harry Potter.

Not a lot of special features until the last movie, but I never cared for them. Last time I checked, its more affordable than the American compilation. Great if you only want the movies. Individually, the movies aren't that great. However, marathon watching is a treat, get to see the kids age before your eyes and you immediately get all the callbacks to previous entries. If you watched them in theaters, it was probably years between entries so you might have missed a lot of callbacks and plot points.

They even call it as such in the movie dialog.  I believe the title change was for some marketing reasons, something to do with Americans would not be as interested if ""philosopher"" was in the title.  Personally I would not have cared.

About 2/3 of the way through the movie, in the middle of a very intense scene (Ron accidentally drinking poison), the disc stopped playing. Eventually I was able to get the movie to continue, but it skipped the end of that scene. So now I have the complete set minus the last half of one scene.

This is the British, ""zone-free"" version that doesn't work with every blu-ray player. All of my PC's running Cyberlink were unable to read these discs (I have PC's connected to my TV's).  A LG branded bluray player was the only reader that could play these discs.  ALSO - the last disc didn't work at all (Deathly Hallows 2) Don't BUY these.

I thought it would be nice to have another set of movies especially because, the first movie is the Philosopher's Stone, ( same one as Sorcerers stone) I thought that would be cool. I could use instead of my single ones , or other sets I keep without watching. This set is good for that. If all you want are the movies, by all means purchase this set. Be aware this is just a set taken from libraries of movie rental places. See the pictures and see them saying for rental or resale. The Blu ray dvd's have no problems, at least mine don't.

My only complaint is, and I didn't realize this until I received them, these discs are for RENTAL PURPOSES, which is stamped on each disc. What's more, the first movie is the British version, so it is  NOT called ""The Sorcerer's Stone"", but rather ""The Philosopher's Stone"". This is what is spoken in the movie.

5938969,4,B005QI4U0W,Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife.  We had just finished listening to the entire Harry Potter series on audio disk during a LONG road trip with our grandchildren.  We had no idea that the stories would be so absorbing for a couple in our 60's. When we got home we saw that a couple of the stories were showing on TV.  But they were filled with So Many ads!  That's when I decided to buy the complete set on BluRay so that we can watch them in the correct order whenever we want.  We've seen them twice in the past three months.,1460160000,,540,4.104761904761904

This is the complete set of movies.  The first one is called ""Philosopher's Stone"" instead of ""Sorcerer's Stone.""  From other reviews, this is the UK name.  Same movie.

The packaging is compact which I appreciate for storage reasons.  I don't usually look at all the extras anyway.  What I don't like, and why I gave it only 4 stars, was that all of the information about each disc is underneath the disc and clear plastic packaging - description, time duration, etc.",1459209600,,600,4.757281553398058

Both times we watched all of the movies, but at the exact same spot on the 7th disc, the video stopped just before the battle at Hogwarts. And both times we got a weird customs-type of form that popped up from India or somewhere. We could skip further on in the video and it would start playing correctly again. We really want this set in our collection, and I was hoping this set would do the job for us as it was the least expensive full set with extras. But, I guess we'll have to try another one and see if it works. Part of me wonders if they sent us the same set we sent back again, but I don't know how that could have happened. Anyway, if you buy this set, check out that last disc before it's to late to return it if need be.",1459036800,,784,4.0

5938995,2,B005QI4U0W,"I believed the other reviewers when they said Blue Ray discs produced for the British market would play fine on U.S. players.  THIS IS NOT TRUE!  The discs skipped and jumped, stopped and stuck, and were entirely unwatchable.  When they got stuck, the player was unresponsive to the remote and nothing short of turning it off at the player and restarting would even allow me to eject the disc.  Also, the discs do not have the scene selection menu so you have no way except fast forward to go back to where the problem started and see if you can continue the movie.  This happened over and over again.  The discs were not dirty, the player was not dirty, and there were no scratches or marks on the discs.  They just would not play.  I will not buy Blue Ray discs produced for the British market ever again.  If the set you are contemplating has the first movie titled ""Philosopher's Stone"", it was produced for the British market.  If you have a U.S. player, the set you want should have the first movie titled ""Sorcerer's Stone"" - unless you enjoy screaming and cursing when your movies stop or skip in the middle of a crucial scene and you can't get them restarted again without 10 minutes of fiddling only to find there is no menu to take you to where you left off.",1458432000,,1269,4.407725321888412

The price is great, but the last movie would skip 20 to 30 seconds ahead sometimes and occasionally freeze for a few moments. Also, the image quality on these is not true blu Ray quality. Image blur and artifacts can be seen in dark objects on screen. Average bit rate for these copies of the movies is 15 to 18mbps whereas real blu Ray will be between 24 to 30mbps and in some cases even more. I do not recommend anyone to buy these.

My only gripe is that none of the films take up the whole screen. I watched them on a new 55"" widescreen TV and every single one of the movies had black bars beneath and above the picture. It might have something to do with the way the movies were filmed or by the fact that these are actually meant to be sold in the UK, but it annoyed me a little bit.

This is the version that is stamped Ireland on the back.  We will be buying the other (more expensive) set.

Also, this appears to be a UK version (thus the Ireland stamp)...many (good) scenes we saw in US versions are missing!!  For instance, the scene with Hermione and Rom skipping rocks in the Deathly Hallows, is completely missing as are many more--too many to mention here.  Bummer!",1454889600,,686,4.666666666666667

As a fan of the original title of the book (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) I was delighted to get the edition of the movie with the actual title.  The ""Sorcerer's Stone"" was a nonsense title for American audiences for the book and the movie.

In the UK, they use Philosopher's Stone, while in the US, they use Sorcerer's Stone.

5939091,4,B005QI4U0W,"Obtaining a good set of this Harry Potter Blu-ray collection did not go smoothly at first. I initially bought the 2011 version of the 8-film collection, as that was the cheapest, but seemed mostly the same as the 2013 version. I didn't check all the discs, but there was a glitch on the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 disc where the movie would freeze at the same point in time, making it impossible to watch several minutes of the movie. I returned that set for the slightly more expensive 2013 8-film set (about $10 more), and while I didn't watch Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 all over again, I checked that same part of the movie and found that it did not have the same issue. Watched a couple of the other earlier movies and they didn't have any issues.

Other than that one issue and the hassle of having to return a set just to buy another set, I also found trying to figure out the differences in the collections to be very confusing.  At this point I would definitely recommend the 2013 version over the 2011 version if you're going 8 disc version over the 11 disc version (which I haven't tried).",1453507200,,1091,4.396039603960396

Put in Prisoner of Azkaban and it just started playing. The case indicates that there are the normal 'special features' included with disc, but lo-and-behold, there were no extras--not even a menu!

Not to mention that the quality was not that of a true blu-ray.

Seems to be a problem that other people are having as well.

So far, the discs work like a charm and the box is in great condition. I was a little confused at first because each case save the last one has two films in each. Even the artwork on the box has the cover of one film on the front and the cover of the sequel on the back. The last case has four films, the two Deathly Hallows parts and also bonus features.

5939151,5,B005QI4U0W,"I didn't discover until after the return window closed that the set I ordered does not offer Closed Captions, on the first 5 episodes. They're available on the last. I have a hearing problem that makes the voices of most women and children totally unintelligible, so any not-captioned DVDs are useless to me. Captioning on DVDs is currently voluntary, so unless Amazon includes correct information on captioning in the product description,  I can't tell until I buy one and try it. In this case, the set was bought in October as a Christmas present, so we didn't discover the problem until last night, well beyond the 30-day window for returns.

Update: Apparently Amazon merges all reviews for the Harry Potter set, even though there are 3 different offerings. I bought the set dated May 14, 2003 in the list, and Amazon's description says ""Subtitles: English"". But there are no subtitles/captions/options at all on the first disk. I would buy another set (the original is beyond the 30-day return window), but how would I know whether other descriptions are accurate either?

UPDATE: Amazon generously refunded my account for this set, and I ordered a replacement 5-disc set to replace the ""defective"" DVDs in the original set. HOWEVER, I found the set of 5 to be similarly ""not captioned"". At this point I decided that the DVDs were probably OK, and that either I or my equipment were the problem. I turns out to be mostly an inconsistency in the way the Languages (and captioning) option on these DVDs is presented to the user; the remainder of the blame falls on me, a user who, in my (weak) defense had never seen this inconsistency in many years of viewing DVDs.

""Normally"", as the DVD is loaded, a menu is presented listing all options, including Languages. In these ""defective"" DVDs, you must wait until the movie actually begins, then press ""Pop-Up Menu"" (on my DVD player controller; may be different on others) to call up the normal menu. Pressing it at the wrong time will do nothing, throw an error, or, on some, call up a different menu of special features. Having seen this sequence, it's actually much more convenient for those who don't normally mess with the Options menu. If the DVD player could be set to always turn on captioning, it would be even better.",1451001600,,2278,4.774111675126903

I will update if the replacement set does not have the same problem. Not happy I had to pay the on-demand price to finish the movie we had waited three weeks to watch (while we finished reading the book).

*********************************************************************

Overall, this set delivers great value. I spent more buying the first four movies when they were released. I bought this set primarily to get the last four movies and secondarily to replace our existing DVDs with Blu-Ray. The picture quality of the old DVDs suffers greatly with a 4K TV; these look great. After reading the other reviews, I was not expecting bonus content for each movie, therefore I'm pleased to report the inclusion of deleted scenes and some ""making of"" features on each disc. I'm sure there are other sets with more content, extended director's cuts and so on, but this set includes at least what was on the original theatrical release discs. Another bonus, the movies start immediately upon starting the disc, you don't have to wait through a long intro animation to load the menu or page through menus (an annoying feature of the aforementioned DVDs). My only caution: my kids kept asking why ""they"" changed the name of the first movie to the Philosopher's Stone. I tried to explain about the original  name of the book and so on, but they found it ""weird"". I need to get a UK copy of the book and really freak them out. :)",1449446400,,1565,4.810408921933085

Could not enjoy those movies with the constant interruptions by the directors and actor/actresses comments. I wanted to watch the movie but can't watch without these interruptions. Would recommend buying them separately. I will have to repurchase 7 & 8 individually I guess if I want to watch the movies. My rating is low just because of this.,1441756800,,515,4.48936170212766

5939284,4,B005QI4U0W,"I like how a lot of fans are slamming Warner Brothers for offering up a box set containing all eight films in one compact package. They accuse how WB constantly does this for the Harry Potter franchise, and to be fair, WB has been doing incomplete Potter boxed releases for years, starting with ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" onwards. But when the WB actually makes a nice package with all eight films included, they still complain because there's hardly any bonus material. WB did this for their first four Batman movies before the glorious Batman Anthology came to be, so those fans have been waiting a long time that as well.

The set will just have a repressing of the initial releases, and the first three movies include their respective trailers, while ""Deathly Hallows Parts 1 & 2"" have deleted/extended scenes, so the ""no extras"" claim doesn't hold as much water. They have some, as opposed to none. Not to mention the quality of the past three Ultimate Editions' bonus features have declined to th... Read more",1441584000,,1010,4.771428571428571

UK's version is Region Free and doesn't have any 50i encoding so these UK discs will work on all US Blu Ray players (when I finally get one). This is how Warner Brothers makes all of it's Blu Rays.

It is disappointing to learn that this is just a repackaging of the existing Blu-ray discs that are currently in other sets, as well as the lack of proper representation of the disc art as photographed by the product image in this listing. But these are just minor complaints.

5939337,2,B005QI4U0W,"This should be pointed out before buying this, if you're like me you actually like to hear the dialog. The problem with this is if you turn your volume up enough to hear the dialog then when effects or music start it's so loud it literally causes glass to vibrate in our room. We sit about 12 feet from the tv, and we have a sound bar. I have exceptional hearing, wife on the other hand doesn't lol.

Other than that, the movies are decent but after the second movie none truly follow the books, so if you're expecting the book to come to life on the screen, it won't, so much is different. Granted we saw these at the theaters but wanted this set for our movie collection, unfortunately we will return it because of the sound issues.",1438214400,4,734,4.280575539568345

Thankfully they were kind enough to send me a return level so at least I don't get stuck with shipping. I had a feeling this set was too good to be true.

The deleted scenes that are included in the extended edition (but not this edition) aren't that necessary- not worth another $30 or whatever the box set costs.

5939449,5,B005QI4U0W,"(You don't have to go to Amazon.uk to get the cheaper package anymore; it's right here. It's the one with three faces of Harry on the cover.)
There are a few 'complete set' versions of the HP series on Blu-ray. The movies themselves look great on all of them, so the difference goes only to packaging, extras and value. If you like loads of extras, get the set with the picture of Hogwarts and students crossing the lake in boats on the cover. Personally, I don't care beans about extras; I never watch them. For me, the set with pictures of Harry's face on the cover was a much better value. It is half the price (at the time of this review), it contains all 8 films (none on 3D), and it looks nice on the shelf. It doesn't have a ton of extras, but there are a few. The packaging is a slipcover that houses plastic cases for the movies themselves.
This set is the UK version of the movies, but they will play just fine on American Blu-ray players. Blu-ray doesn't have region coding like DVD does. The only difference between the UK and US versions is that with this set you get the UK poster movie covers (kind of cool, imo), and the 'Sorcerer's Stone' is called the 'Philosopher's Stone' (just like with the books).

I was disappointed in not seeing a difference in the Bluray editions. You would think it should make some difference? Toy story was awesome but it was animated so maybe that is why. Harry Potter seems darker and no eye catching affect. Oh well. I am new to replacing (only a dozen or so more dvds were purchased to replace old versions of mostly Disney movies, in Bluray versions. Because of animation being so colorful to begin with, I suppose that is why such a difference. I AM sight impaired so may not be best judge.

The discs themselves say ""labeled for resale or rental""...I am not sure what that means. But when you put it in the BD player it just starts playing. No titles or other intros, and so far (still watching #1) no option for set-up, features, language etc. Apparently I should have known this was some kind of bargain box set.

5939487,5,B005QI4U0W,"**Review is for the UK Region Free 11 Disc Item**
Definitely grainy low quality picture even for the newer ones. Super cheap packaging. You get what you pay for. Was rather fun seeing the UK version of the movies. A few title variations, and there were definitely scenes that were slightly different in dialogue and length. Had a couple issues with discs having a few bad spots such as issue with picture during a scene and sound pops going through the system. (only the last 2 or 3 discs had the issue with varying frequency). Bought this for a friend but I'm holding out for a super high quality blue Ray HD set for myself.

**Update**
I have since re-purchased from the same seller for my own collection during a Black friday deal to get the buyndle of all 8 for $35. The quality of these is Much better now and no issues with case or sound! I'm in the midst of binge watching them again and am completely satisfied with the quality of these!",1422835200,,945,4.4
5939488,5,B005QI4U0W,"After looking at several reviews, it rather looks like Amazon is grouping reviews of several versions all together.  To be clear, then, this is for the version titled ""Harry Potter - The Complete 8-Film Collection [Blu-ray] [2011][Region Free].""

It's not indicated in the Amazon listing (In fact, the listing at the time of this review doesn't even include a description), but since the first movie in this is ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"" it's clearly the UK versions.  That said, the movies play fine, look crisp and clear, and the discs include many extras -- I was especially pleased to see a lot of deleted scenes I'd not previously seen.

Fantastic bargain for the price -- $43.41 at the time of my purchase -- and I couldn't be happier.",1422835200,,758,4.8076923076923075

I hadn't seen them most of them since the theater, and it was amazing to see how well they played back-to-back. The whole story flows really well all the way through. Quality of the Blurays is great. I wish they had included the final film in 3D, but I just bought it separately to have it in my collection. The extra features are pretty good too on these. I haven't watched them all but the ones I did see gave a fun glimpse into film-making and I actually learned a few cool facts... like the actor who played the lead in Willow actually played all of the dwarf characters in Harry Potter. Really cool!

Definitely check this out if you haven't seen the films or if you're looking to add to your collection. These are definitely modern classics that can be enjoyed over and over again.",1422748800,2,857,4.424050632911392

To find the value of the individual film you're getting, we divide the price by the number of films to get an individual price of $5.92 per film!

5939516,5,B005QI4U0W,"Will not review the films themselves (you either like them or not, most likely you already enjoy them or you would not be considering  purchase of the Blu-ray versions).
The Blu-ray versions of these films are outstanding.  We have all the DVDs and have watched them many times.  The Blu-ray transition really adds more detail and in a manner that makes the films even more enjoyable.
For example, you can now easily make out the dirt and grime on the faces of Hermione, Ron and Harry during the final two films.  The Gryffindor common room's tapestries and walls have even more observable detail.  Obviously there are many other examples including the ceiling changes in the Great Hall and the paintings on the walls.  The 'black colors' (which are more prominent in the latter films) come across very well in the Blu-ray versions...with detail and richness that I had not noted in the DVDs.
I was also impressed with the sound quality of the films, though the visual differences are by far the reason to upgrade to Blu-ray if you have not already done so.
So, if you are wondering if the purchase of the Blu-ray versions of these movies is worth the upgrade, (Jurassic Park was NOT in terms of visual improvement, but was nice for audio) in the case of Harry Potter, it really is.",1419379200,4,1282,4.650442477876106

5939578,4,B005QI4U0W,"I want to help clarify the difference between the 2 affordable Harry Potter Blu-Ray series, to you all. I've been back and forth on which to buy for the last several months. When searching on Amazon for this set, you'll notice that there are 2 sets, both with all 8 movies, both with the same number of reviews. There is usually between an $8-$15 difference in price between the 2. These are INDEED different, regardless of how similar they are described. Here's why

I'll start with the blu-ray that has 3 differently aged Harry's on the cover. You'll notice that it is bigger than the other collection being sold. What they don't tell you is that the discs are in 4 separate cases, 2 movies in each case. There are also 11 discs, not just 8. But to be clear on this, the 3 extra discs are just bonus content from the last 3 movies. All of the other movies have the bonus features on the same disc. There is a ton of extra content on each disc. You'll also notice, from a side view picture, the list of movies that are in the box. The first says, ""The Philosopher's Stone"", rather than ""The Sorcerer's Stone"". Don't worry, it's not a bootleg copy. It's the English (UK) version of the set. The U.S. version changed the name for marketing purposes and it doesn't affect anything about the set.

Now for the OTHER set being sold:

This set, with the cover being of the castle, is smaller and more compact. This is because it has an insert that unfolds with all movies attached to each fold. It's neater, takes up less space, and in my opinion, looks more like the set it should be. However, this set contains only 8 discs (1 for each movie), with NO Bonus Content discs. I know about this set because It is the same that I borrowed from a friend.
So, there's not much of a difference here. I bought the bigger looking box because of the extra content and it was cheaper. The other box looks more like a classic collection but lacks content. Still, any Harry Potter Collection is worth buying. You'll always have an urge to watch it again and again (I watch the series twice a year). The Blu-Ray makes a huge difference in quality over DVD, so if you have a good TV and a Blu-Ray player, you have to go Blu-Ray.

Hope this helped!

***UPDATE April 2017***

There's been a little more confusion because Amazon has added a couple other collections and newer Blu-rays of single movie of Harry Potter. It has been more difficult to search for collections so i've made it easier for you. Here are the links for the above mentioned collections that I reviewed:

""3 Faces of Harry"" collection (currently $65 on Amazon) -- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AQNOCZ0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0

""Hogwarts Castle Cover"" collection (currently $60 on Amazon) -- https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005OCFHHK/ref=cm_cd_asin_lnk

Amazon has changed their Harry Potter supply lately. I'm not sure why, but Amazon has combined ALL reviews for different H.P. collections into one, leaving it difficult to distinguish between them all. Now it's hard to tell what any review is for. If my links are not highlighted, just copy and paste them.
***If you Search ""Harry Potter Blu Ray Collection"", it WILL NOT show you the ""3 Faces"" collection so please use the link that i've provided above***

***I would also like to make an important note of feedback from readers. There are versions that you need to be aware of that are MAY NOT be playable in the U.S. It's another collection that is European made and most of the time, the discs are not playable on North American Blu-Ray Players. Obviously if you're reading this and you live in Europe, it'll work for you. I've started to notice those little numbers on the cover that have an Octogon with a number in the center. It means Irish Film Classification Office. They're definitely European made discs. Buy at your own risk though. One reader wrote that they played on his Playstation but couldn't comment on a Blu-Ray Player.***

This should still help everyone. I will continue to update as needed in order to help you.
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them has created another buzz in the world of Harry Potter. If you haven't seen the movie, it is ""Fantastic""! AND IT'S COMING OUT ON BLU-RAY SOON!!!!!!!!!

One departures from American blu-rays is that the discs go immediately to the film itself.  Those who are tired of wading through endless trailers will appreciate this.  If you want the Special Features, you just need to press the menu button.  They don't seem to have subtitles, and if you want to go to an individual scene, you need to click forward on your remote.  If this presents a problem, you may want to buy the American edition.  But I felt that the additional features were worth the sacrifice.

You then have to go through all the announcements, and ads before you can go to the scene selection and try to find where you were.  Also, a minor complaint - the first disc is labeled ""Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone"" instead of ""Sorcerer's Stone""  Doesn't matter to the content but you'd think they could get the titles right..",1405641600,,506,4.408602150537634

Picture and sound quality are great with my recently purchased Samsung Home Theater. The price is very convenient, specially considering that there are 11 blu-ray discs in total. So it is really a great deal.

Now, the reason why I gave the product four stars and not five: the description states that all movies include subtitles in many idioms, including Spanish (I am from Uruguay, South America). The thing is, that only movies 7 part 1 and 7 part 2 come with these, while all the others include only English subtitles. This is not a huge problem for me because I know English and watching movies is always an opportunity to improve my skills, but it might be one considering that some of my family members do not know English.

The last two movies are in a case with two disks of bonus content, for a total of ten disks in all.  If you are looking for a really nice ""no frills"" version of each of the movies with few extra features (for a reasonable price) then this is the set that you want.

5939655,5,B005QI4U0W,"This review is for the 11 Disc U.K. Region Free Blu-Ray Harry Potter Collection

The discs are in four separate  Blu-Ray cases. The first 3 cases hold the first 6 movies and each are slightly larger  than a normal Blu-Ray case. The last 2 movies are in the final case and the case is the size of two normal Blu-Ray cases. All cases are in an outer cardboard box.

I have only seen the first two movies so far. The first 5 movies have 1 disc, while the remaining 3 movies have 2 discs each. While the last 3 movies have an extra disc for more features, the first 5 movies aren't completely extra-less. The first 5 movies do have Deleted Scenes on the discs of the movies as well as a few extras (some interviews, trailers and what not). Don't expect a special features packed box set but it does have some extra features.

My set arrived in perfect condition.....the outer box is perfect and the cases inside are not broken and the discs arrived secured and not loose.

The Video quality of the first two movies is excellent and what I expect from a Blu-Ray. I don't have a 5.1 sound system and I only watch the movies with headphones so not sure about audio quality other than it sounds great in my headphones. I am sure the sound is great in 5.1 systems.

5939661,4,B005QI4U0W,"First I want to say that, as per usual, everything with the order and delivery was excellent.

The reason I came to comment is that what we received was the UK version of the films/ box set.  My initial worry was that they wouldn't be coded correctly, but that didn't turn out to be an issue.

The only real issue I could see is that if a purist was looking for a US version, they might be disappointed.  The first movie in the UK is called ""HP and the Philosophers Stone"".  I am not sure if the actual movies are any different though.

Anyway, just though that it should be known that you may get the UK version of the movies, even though nothing on the listing would indicate as much.",1392336000,,686,4.198473282442748

1. All of the movies are correctly labeled and accurate.
2. The lighting of the movies was on par with the theatrical releases.

My biggest complaint about this set is only with the boxes that the movies came in.  I will be looking to purchase new blueray cases to keep these videos from getting scratched up during storage and moving them around.

There are extras included with these discs, as well.

The pleasant surprise was that these movies still did come with special features, not a lot, but more than expected.  Since the first few movies were made before Blu-ray & HD were streamlined, they don't have HD sound (or whatever the technical terms are) according to my much more tech savvy husband, but this doesn't bug us as the sound (like the acting) improves with each movie.",1389657600,,579,4.647058823529412

5939683,5,B005QI4U0W,"Since all the reviews for several versions of the product all end up on the same page, let me start off saying I got the 11 disc Blu-ray set. I'll also use this review to set aside any misguidings others have posted about. I'll admit I was a bit worried ordering this, but I had positive hopes I was wrong.

This set is UK Region Free (you can tell by the movie ratings, as they're not MPAA ratings). They come in four plastic containers in a cardboard enclosure, with two movies to a container. The first five movies aren't true Blu-ray (with menus, etc), they're the movies in Blu-ray format, with some special features available. The quality is still superb. Once you get to movies 6, 7, and 8 you get a real Blu-ray experience with menus for other Blu-ray options, as well as a second disc of special features (one movie disc and one special features disc for movies 6, 7, and 8).

My only gripe is that there are two movies in a thick plastic case over a single movie in a slim case (such as how the Star Trek movie Blu-ray collection is packaged), but that's just me. The discs all work perfectly fine. This is definitely the complete set to order if you want just the movies and some special features, and not spend hundreds on a ""collectors case"" with stuff you'll only look at once.",1388620800,4,1291,4.375

The picture quality of these discs is in some cases worse than the DVD versions we own.  There isn't a master audio track or even an HD audio track.  There aren't even any disc menus!

These are the UK discs though so there are some differences (Philosopher's Stone vs Sorcerers, etc) but I can't imagine it's all that different (I haven't watched all of them yet).

5939716,5,B005QI4U0W,"Update 6/3/15: This review was originally posted in 2013 under a listing for the UK Boxed Set that has since been removed by Amazon. I have deleted that review and re-posted it under the current listing. Please note this was written prior to the release of the Hogwarts Collection, which is why that set is not referenced in my review. That said, my opinion and recommendation of UK set remains unaffected. Original review follows:

This review is specifically for the UK Blu-Ray set, which is Region-Free and ""should"" play on any North American Blu-Ray player. For the record, I have a North American 120GB PS3 Slim, and all of the discs, movies and special features alike, played flawlessly.

Two things in particular attracted me to this collection over its US counterpart. First of all, it's cheaper. The price of the US set has come down in recent months, but this one is still less expensive as of this writing. Better still, there is more content in the UK version. For those of you who don't know, this set is basically a compilation of the individual releases of each film. While the first five films were released as single discs, the last three were 2-disc sets (with, as you might expect, the movie on the first disc and the special features on the second). The US version omits the special features discs for the last three films, but they are included here. Now, obviously, this collection is not as comprehensive as the Ultimate Editions or the Wizard's Collection. There are no extended cuts or 3D versions here, and since the early films were limited to single discs, the extras are somewhat lacking. But for the more casual Harry Potter fan like myself, you're getting all you probably need for under $50. FYI, as of this writing, it is actually slightly on Amazon UK than it is here, including shipping.

I have no complaints about the video quality of these discs. I'm sure the early films would've benefited from having separate discs for the special features thereby allowing for a higher bit-rate for the movies themselves, but they look fine. The later films, having more room to breathe as well as simply being newer, look fantastic. I have yet to experience the lossless audio options as I have an older A/V receiver, but the lossy Dolby Digital and DTS tracks sound great for what they are.

I will say that the packaging could have been better. The set comes in a cardboard slipcase housing four Blu-Ray cases containing two movies each. This is fine, but the hinges on the disc trays are a bit flimsy and the fourth case, which houses the two Deathly Hallows movies, is unnecessarily thick with a lot of empty space for the discs to be jostled around and become dislodged during shipping. Fortunately, this didn't happen to me, but I'm sure it easily could have.

That minor complaint aside, I couldn't be happier with this purchase and would recommend this collection to anyone who wants the Harry Potter movies but can't justify the expense of the Ultimate Editions or the Wizard's Collection.",1373760000,,3024,4.752380952380952
5939717,4,B005QI4U0W,"There are two discs per case, so it isn't one individual title and cover per case. But, it's a great deal to own the complete set.",1373500800,,130,4.038461538461538
5939718,5,B005QI4U0W,"Region free being the key, I have no issues playing these.  The only difference is that I watch ""The Philosophers Stone"" instead of ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and that doesn't bother me in the slightest.  I love my Harry Potter collection!!",1373328000,,236,4.875
5939719,5,B005QI4U0W,"I had previously purchased or received as gifts the prior 6 movies on DVD - most wide-screen but I think one gift was a full screen version.  I decided I'd like a Blu-ray copy but they were usually around $70 or more for the set so never bought it and I actually had not seen the Deathly Hallows either.  After receiving a gift card I figured what the heck, I'll go ahead and get the 11 disc set that was available at a more reasonable price.  Here's what I noticed after watching all the movie discs (I pretty much had to so I'd remember everything and also to verify the disc were good).

First the breakdown of the 11 disc - as mentioned they come in a ""box"" that isn't high quality but does the job of keeping the four cases together in a group.  The four cases are labeled so you can see which ""years"" are included in the case.  Two of the cases have two disc each, one has years 1 & 2 while the other has years 3 and 4.  The third case has years 5 and 6 with a special features disc for year 6 (Half-blood Prince).  Finally, there's the largest case that holds year 7 part 1 & 2 and the special features for both so a total of 4 discs in this last case.  All of my discs had labels and I didn't have the blank or black label mentioned in other reviews.

Quality of movies on Blu-ray - I'd say the first few movies seemed more like DVD copies and the sound was not as good as my LOTR Blu-ray collection.  The later movies seemed better but perhaps that's to be expected with the first movie being from 2001 and the last movie around 2011?

As I mentioned in the 11 discs breakdown, only the last three movies have the special features disc included.  The others have minor special features  like trailers, deleted/extended scenes, some actors talking about their characters and such.  I also believe the Half-Blood Prince had the ""Enhanced"" movie playback feature but am pretty sure the Deathly Hallows did not.  I'd also mentioned on the first few movies I think they just went right into play mode so if you want to get to the menu you have to use the remote to bring it up to view the minor features or wait until the movie is over and then forward through the credits.  Being the ""All"" regions versions means you will see a lot more warnings about the copyright as the screen is shown in multiple languages.

So if you are looking for the complete set, don't care too much about having a ton of special features for each movie or if you want a region free version, then this may be the best option for you.  However if you like extended version and want more than you would have seen at the theater or just want to see all the special features or have an attractive storage box/case, then you'll have to look elsewhere.",1372982400,5,2728,4.251937984496124

Subtitles for ""The Deathly Hollows"" part 1 and part 2 are found as a tab under ""Languages"" as normally found (I hadn't viewed either of these at the time of the original review).  Subtitles for the other six movies can be located in the drop-down menu that contains choices for the aspect ratio and display items.  For me, the blue tag marked ABC was the selection that turned on/off the subtitles.  The quality of the movies that I did play were clearly up to ""Blu-Ray"" quality, with each of the movies, up to the Deathly Hollows pair, the movie disc contained options to view the movie's associated ""special features"" and a number of related interviews that were interesting. Both of the Deathly Hollows movies had a separate ""special features"" disc.

5939737,4,B005QI4U0W,So far so good! I have not had a chance to watch them all to see if all them have the same quality and format that others have complained about. They came fast like they were suppose to so no issues there. The only thing that they don't tell you is which version US or UK these are. The first movie is Harry and the Philosophers Stone which is the UK version and while it really doesn't matter it would be nice to know.,1365206400,,419,4.0

5939749,3,B005QI4U0W,"If this rating were based on the movies alone, I'd give this 4.5 stars hands-down.  The films are very well shot, lit, dressed, acted, etc etc etc.  While I would have liked a little more depth on some points, I get that not everything can be covered in a film based on a book.

My major complaint is in the 'Special Features"" aspect.

I specifically got the 11 disc version of this, as the 30+ disc version is just too much money.  I don't know what WB is playing at for making a set so expensive and the only way to get the bonus footage.  The first five movies had very little bonus content worth talking about, most of it games and gimmicks, and very little truly behind the scenes footage.  The final 3 had a bit more, but they also had a separate blu-ray of 'bonus footage' for each.  I don't even think there was 1.5 hours on average of decent, well thought footage, and only a couple of the spots were truly gripping (the ones dealing with JK Rowling mostly) and insightful.

Being a long-time LOTR fan, and having owned the first extended trilogy they released (4 discs per film, 12 discs total), and the second set on blu-ray (5 discs per film, 15 discs total), and only costing $60 for the latest set, that's about $20/film.  I'd have gladly paid $160ish for some real bonus footage, but I don't think it actually exists.  In the LOTR set, they walk through the making of the films, starting with the birth of JRRT, all the way to the final release of the third film (111 years of info, only 6-7 in a studio, you had 10 years), and that's only 6 of the 9 bonus discs- the last 3 are a documentary on each film.  It covers every single aspect of the films.

I paid $8/film, I'd say it was a deal. I'd also say I'm stuck, because the only edition currently available with more footage is $350ish ($43/film) and I'm not willing to part with that (read the reviews- others that love bonus footage were also disappointed).  So thanks WB for a full set of the films, but maybe next time you do a big release, like this, take some notes from the folks over at New Line.  They've got their act together on how to release a box set.  In fact, so does Fox (Star Wars), Paramount (Indie Jones), Disney/Pixar (Up, Toy Story, pretty much everything), Dreamworks (everything) and you actually did on your Kubrick set.  How did you manage to let one of the longest running film series fall apart on such a monumental release on the highest quality home-viewing platform fall apart like this?  If you do another one properly, it'd be nice, and I'll need to see some seriously positive reviews first.",1362873600,,2594,4.391213389121339

5939751,5,B005QI4U0W,"This is a great collection. I spent a lot of time trying to decide what collection to buy. The regular 8 film Blu-ray collection seemed like a quickly thrown together, cheap set. Many reviews said the same thing. So, I did what some other customers suggested, I got the UK version.

This is definitely the way to go. The UK film collection is of a better quality and costs less than the American version. It is region free so it plays on all Blu-ray players. Don't make the mistake of thinking you can do the same with the DVD collection because those are all region locked.

This is more affordable and just all around better value. It even has bonus features, which I love.

To sum it up, the UK version costs less, gives you more, and isn't some cheap looking little collection.",1361491200,5,781,4.4475524475524475

I don't really need all the extra bells-and-whistles (maps, cards, locket, DVD duplicate movies, etc), and I don't want to pay the high price for what I honestly consider just a bunch of junk (not being a collector, just an average fan).  Can't WB put out a box set of all the Ultimate Editions that would include only blu-ray discs and ALL the special features and commentary?  Priced in the $150-200 range?  I'm thinking/hoping that after all the hype of the Wizards Collection is over, a set like this will probably show up. That is what I am waiting for.

There was a lot of discussions about what versions work or don't work, so I wanted to chime in.  We have a Blue-Ray player that we bought about 9 years ago, so it is not the latest technology.  These Blue-Ray disks work just fine, we have not had any problems.

Before we purchased this version, I searched everywhere for a HP set that had ""extras"" but I could not find them from any US seller.  We purchased this version (even with our fear about European systems not working with ours) because it was the only set that offered the ""behind the scenes"" and other extras.  What is weird is that the description doesn't even mention the extras!  But since the description did say that there were double the number of disks compared to any other set, we had our fingers crossed that we would be receiving the ""extras"".  WE DID!  My kids love it and love showing it to their friends because no one else seems to have these extras.

As for the digital copies, we have not tried to access them, so I cannot speak to those.
