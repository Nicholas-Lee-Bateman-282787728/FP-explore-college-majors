She signs too quickly to see what she is really doing and she doesn't repeat slower for new learners.  I have been studying ASL for about a month now, I know a lot of signs but I can't read ASL that fast yet so this disc was not very helpful.  I gave it three stars only because I plan to revisit it again as I learn more down the line.",1475798400,,458,3.778947368421053

8595396,2,B00DOJRU8Y,"Signing is too fast for a beginner.  DVD doesn't even include the signs for ""yes"", ""no"", ""How are you?"", or ""I am fine, thank you"".  Those are the kinds of expressions a beginner needs.  This one would be far more effective if the signing were slower.  It seems to assume the viewer can pick up ASL signing at high speed, when what a beginning viewer needs is a slow demonstration so the sign can be learned properly.",1427500800,,417,4.376623376623376
