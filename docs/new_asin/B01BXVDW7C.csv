8751914,5,B01BXVDW7C,"This is a great DVD from Oldies.com, featuring four more episodes of The Last of the Mohicans, the 1950s syndicated adventure show based on the book by James Fennimore Cooper and starring John Hart and Lon Chaney, Jr. It's a fun show and while it shows it's age, it's very enjoyable. The episodes on this disc include the pair meeting historical figures Ethan Allan and Benjamin Franklin, helping a Native American doctor become accepted in a white settlement, and trying to stop an unscrupulous fur trader from inciting an uprising to increase his profits.  If you like fifties TV, or like this era of history, I think you'll find this a great watch! It's hard to go wrong for less than $6 with Prime.",1461196800,,702,4.661290322580645
