8755703,5,B01DEEVJDK,"Watching this movie I was shocked and disgusted to see how deeply the religious/fascist movement is entrenched in Israeli life. It made me realize how oblivious Americans in general and (sadly) American Jews are to the unbelievable hatred that permeates Israeli life. It made me think  the Israeli religious right would like nothing more than to turn Israel into a theocracy based on Torah law - just like the Shariah law of fanatic Muslims. (See the Israeli film ""Gett"" to get an idea what this looks like.) It's ironic how religious fanatics can use democracies to gain power and eventually co-opt it. The film clearly shows how powerful, uncompromising, and paranoid these forces are. Yet Rabin himself as well as his own personal security detail underestimated that very hatred which led to unbelievably lax security on the night he was murdered - combined with the very real possibility that it was allowed to happen from within.
  Any discussion about Israel must include how the state was born. Although Zionism had been around for some time as a response to historical
anti-semitism worldwide, it took the devastation of the Holocaust to bring it to fruition. It seemed like a ""no-brainer"" that Jews needed their own country to lick their wounds and feel safe. Unfortunately, European Jews poured into Palestine with the same attitude toward the indigenous residents that other European ""settlers"" had had toward the native peoples of Africa, Asia, and the Americas in the years of ""exploration and conquest"": We are the superior people who have the culture, science, technology and GOD ON OUR SIDE. (This last being especially true in the case of the Zionists who claim some mystical, divine right to the so-called Holy Land.) So just like their European predecessors, they came, they saw, and they grabbed - and, in the case of the Israelis, keep grabbing. They also had to forcefully displace three quarters of a million Palestinians in order to establish themselves - a painful fact that has conveniently vanished from the minds of Americans - including my own people, the Jews. Such is the power that comes from the entitlement derived from victim-hood and of course a powerful Israel lobby. To be fair, Palestinians,  Arab states and radical Muslim entities like Alqueda, and Isis have all perpetrated atrocities against Jews, Israelis, and western targets and this keeps Israel's status as victim and ""defender of democracy"" alive and well. As long as these things continue to happen, Israeli intransigence to the peace process will remain and continue to strengthen fascist elements in Israel who in turn will threaten peace in the region and the world.
  Supporters of Israel both inside and outside of the country continue to spout the same tired arguments - arguments laced with bits of truth that are no longer relevant to present conditions, and without any moral weight whatsoever. (Except of course if you are a religious fanatic whose belief in ""divine right"" trumps law, fairness, facts, and reason.) There is no justification on earth that allows one people to subject another to the slow death of apartheid. The ghetto-ization and theft of Palestinian land to provide housing for yarmulke wearing drones incapable of a single original thought will keep the fires of hatred burning and the cycle of attack and retaliation going indefinitely until Israel becomes a total theocratic police state and the Palestinians go the way of the American Indian - an indigenous people crushed by outsiders.
  Israel has played the victim card too long - it no longer applies. It is now the victimizer which weakens not strengthens it. Where is the dream of being a safe haven for Jews when it is surrounded by enemies with whom it wages war every few decades and its citizens can not board a bus without wondering whether they will ever see their families again or be blown to bits. I believe that Israel will not change its ways until Americans wake up and demand that our tax dollars be spent in better ways than blind unconditional, unquestioning support of its destructive policies.",1471910400,,4099,5.0
