7829554,5,6302662338,I see how great every is saying Tim Roth is in this movie but no one has mentioned  what a great job Alexis Arquette did. I think this is one of the best Alexis Arquette movies i have seen and  the reason i liked it so much.,1413504000,,224,3.74468085106383

Absolutely love this film,  Tim Roth is brillant, as always.  Great story but beward of the ending :(",1371772800,,275,4.313725490196078
7829556,4,6302662338,"Have been waiting a long time for this to be released on DVD and was not disappointed.  It showed the problems facing a dysfunctional family and the lengths some people go to solve the problems.  Unfortunately, this one has a sad ending.  Tim Roth was superb as the one trying to help his brother through his difficulties and at the same time trying to sort out his own life.",1341100800,,375,4.405797101449275
7829557,5,6302662338,"I happened by this movie on cable last week, and when I went to order the DVD after all these years, I find that it's only available on VHS. Tim Roth portrays a down-on-his-luck man who tries to help his even worse-off, drug-addicted brother. This is a very moving movie that has been overlooked for too long.",1172016000,3,309,4.43859649122807
7829558,5,6302662338,"I simply loved this movie. Tim Roth is excellent in it, pulling of the New York accent perfectly. Very dramatic, very touching, great acting.",1016668800,3,141,4.916666666666667
7829559,4,6302662338,"One of many interesting films starring the great Tim Roth using the inner city of New York as a character in itself to show the aggression and hopelessness caused by living in the concrete jungle.  In some ways the  film is a comic take on New York, in some ways has a tragic logic.  Most  interesting is how Roth's character relates to such negative circumstances,  trying to surmount the negativity with aggressive will; the ending was  obviously a product of a toss up: should we have him succeed or fail.  Highly recommended.",944006400,5,529,4.684782608695652
