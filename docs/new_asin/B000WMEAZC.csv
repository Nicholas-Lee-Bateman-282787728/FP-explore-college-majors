8224162,5,B000WMEAZC,"To the person who wrote that they thought it was an infomercial I have no idea what DVD they were watching but it obviously was NOT The same one that I was viewing. This is a great juicing video that shows the journey of Ray who had tried to juice before and failed a few days into it and his resolved to pick himself up, dust himself off, and get back in the saddle. While he did not have a big budget and huge crew like Joe Cross did in Fat Sick and Nearly Dead, I think this is closer to an every man view of juicing and sitting at home trying to do it for yourself and actually feeling like you are accomplishing something. I was highly inspired by his Video Diary and how he faithfully showed his trials and struggles as he went through the days until the end. The comments I liked was when he noted in the video diary that his office workers FINALLY noticed (Half way through the fasting I believe) he had lost some weight.
I could not get over how long it took his office workers to wake up and notice Ray had lost weight? What was going on in their worlds? It was highly obvious that he was trucking along with a great rate and doing well. All in all, I loved this video and wish Ray would do a follow up, Heck, Joe Cross is, why not Ray Bartley? After all, he put out the DVD first! I would love to see more from Ray and his camp on his weight loss journey after making 55 pounds in 55 seconds, and where he is today and what he is doing to continue on his life long journey to stay healthy. He has been such an inspiration to me and I am grateful to him for taking the time to make and share this part of his life with all of us! Good work Ray! Stay in the spot light and update your web site! Blog please!!!!! Books Please!!! More Please Ray!!!!",1382659200,,1756,4.02
8224163,5,B000WMEAZC,"Wow. I am simply stunned by this review.

1) Beyond the documentary, the interviews with a registered dietitian, and a whole host of other content (well over 3 hours), there are 57 distinct video clips that comprise each day of the juice fast (including the day he fell of the fast and had to start over), along with menus of everything he ate each day.  How did you not ""get"" a Video Diary in all that?

2) Yes, he did wear the exact same thing (a swim suit), used the same camera and lighting, and stood in the exact same position, as he recorded everything he was thinking and feeling as he went through each day of the juice fast. He did that on purpose so you could see exactly what was happening to him without anything distracting from the changes he was experiencing and recording.

3) You're saying, he looked the same from Day 1 to Day 55?? It is this comment that blows me away. Go to his website (55in54.com) Look at the Day 0 Video Clip and stop it while it's playing. Open up another browser, play the Day 37 Video Clip and stop it while playing. Now switch back and forth between the two. You don't see any difference?? On Day 0, he weighed 278; on Day 37, he weighed 235. The difference is like night and day.

Look at the DVD trailer which is on his website and on YouTube (search for ""juice fasting documentary"") and watch for the morphing sequence in the last 5 seconds where he goes from Day 0 to Day 54. The change is stunning. All I can think of is, you watched a couple of days, didn't notice a change between them (you never will between any two given days), and came over to write this review. Very sad.

4) You ""guessed"" his main intent was to release a DVD from the beginning rather than show it on YouTube for free. Saying things like this makes me think you didn't even watch the DVD. The whole reason he started recording himself was because he had started and failed 5 previous juice fasts and he thought if he recorded himself and put it out on the Internet, he would be too embarrassed to fail.

He started recording, failed on what was to be Day 2 (his taped failure's on the DVD as well), but it was going back and looking at his taped failure that gave him the strength to start again, and this time, continue on for 54 days. It was only when he finished the juice fast, looked back at the footage he had created, and saw the incredible change, both mentally and physically, he had undergone, that he got the idea to make the DVD.  All of this is described in the documentary, which is what makes me think you really didn't watch it.

He truly thought that if people saw what juice fasting did for him, they would consider it themselves. He wanted to change people's lives. That's why he made the DVD. Like he said, the DVD has over 3 hours of content including a professionally shot documentary, interviews with a registered dietitian, the Diary, bloopers, and a whole lot more.  There's no way he could put all that on YouTube. Having said that, he did make several clips available if people want to get a feel for what's on the DVD. Just go to his website, 55in54.com.

5) You thought the DVD sounds like an infomercial? Well, the powers of juice fasting are so amazing that when he describes it, it probably does sound a bit like one. There's one critical difference though: all he's suggesting to people is that the way to dramatic and permanent weight loss and the rejuvenation of their health and energy levels (oops, now I'm doing it!), is to buy fruits and vegetables and a juicer. And he doesn't make a dime doing that. He doesn't sell juice fasts. No one can. That's why the $40 billion dollar diet industry doesn't want you to even know about juice fasting. They can't make any money from it.

Don't you understand? Juice fasting doesn't require any special foods, or any pills, or any complicated menus. That's the whole point of it. The secret to solving most of the world's weight loss problems can be found in the produce section of the neighborhood grocery store. On the other hand, keep following the advice from all the commercials and infomercials that are selling pills or special foods or require you to follow special menus and you'll understand why 95% of all people who lose weight following that advice, regain it within 1 to 5 years. That's he learned and what he had to tell people.

He thought if he could actually show people what happens to someone; actually let them see the physical and mental changes of someone going through an extended juice-fast day-by-day, they wouldn't be afraid to investigate the most powerful weight-loss technique known to man. It saved his life. He wanted to save other people's lives. That's why he made the DVD.

6) All I can say is this: go to his website and read the testimonials. This DVD is changing people's lives.

I'm truly sorry you didn't enjoy the DVD. But I will tell you this, this is the first negative review I have ever seen of it. I hope you do have a chance to watch it again.

Take care,

Kathy

P.S. You may wonder how I know all this. Well, I'm his wife and I actually saw him go through the juice fast. The 5 stars I've given this DVD represent the ratings from all the other people who purchased the DVD from his website and posted their testimonials. Don't believe me? Go to his website and see.",1199491200,7,5318,4.409183673469387
8224164,2,B000WMEAZC,"I bought this item out of curiosity, for my father too.
A video diary was something that I didn't get or am I too sane to see that guy looks exactly the same from day 1 to day 55, same clothing, same lighting for the camera, same microphone level, same shaving and same belly. When I started watching it, then I noticed a pattern that everyday looks exactly the same, then I just started fast forwarding dvd and I thought it was a some kind of joke. It seems like everything could be done in 54 minutes because everyday looked the same.  It was too scripted. I would imagine that you would talk about belly how smaller it gets day by day but it looked exactly the same all the time.
The video could be taken over a long period of time not even connected with juice fasting.
I felt it was like an infomercial, especially when family members are involved. I don't know, it just seemed too scripted. I guess main intent was to release a dvd from the beginning rather than showing it on youtube for free.
I will watch dvd again and maybe I will change my comment.",1195516800,3,1059,4.268656716417911
