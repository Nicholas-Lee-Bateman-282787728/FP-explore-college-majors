4719107,1,B005KR6NQS,They always advertise the DVD with the sleeve and then you receive cheap no sleeve DVD. That's real upsetting. Amazon should be ashamed of this false advertising.

4719122,5,B005KR6NQS,"You must see my review on "" Tyler Perry's House of Payne complete series 1-8 "". (copy and paste title to in Amazon's search box).
I spilled my heart out writing that review of Tyler Perry shows, movies and plays. There are people who don't understand how this television show, Meet The Browns and all Tyler Perry productions, mimics a very funny, people of Color television show, from the 50's. Back then, organizations  fought to get it off the air because of stereo typing, yet today we seem to have revive that genre and loving it.",1387152000,,534,4.5625
