8090562,3,B000BPFHAM,"I chose this DVD because it was suggested by one of the instructor from the Career Source Center at Alewife, Cambridge, MA.  I was hoping that it would help me with networking while I am looking for a job.",1363996800,,205,4.256410256410256
8090563,3,B000BPFHAM,"I agree that there is a lot of good information provided in this DVD.  Unfortunately, the speaker is not very dynamic at all.  In fact, you can watch his eyes go back and forth as he reads the tele-type machine or whatever he is reading from.

Again, it is good info but if you are looking for something that will really engage an audience, in my opinion this isn't it.  (I'm still searching!)",1201305600,,393,4.342465753424658
8090564,5,B000BPFHAM,"How do real people go about networking in a job search? Eric Ross is a real person who has successfully (as in higher salary each time) networked his way to six executive jobs. He does not have a walks-on-water rsum, a sparkling personality, or Hollywood looks. In short he's like you and me. In this well produced DVD, he tells us very clearly how he was able to do it so that we can do it too.

Eric's methods require persistance and the courage to be yourself. They do NOT require you be someone you are not, nor do they require you to violate the rules of etiquette or to exceed the bounds of good taste. Quite the contrary, successful networking demands that you show professional courtesy at every step. Eric guides you through the THREE opportunities of making that all important first impression. You'll come across as a professional because you'll be acting like one.

There are plenty of books about networking, and you may want to spend the hours it will take to read the better known ones. Listening to this DVD for three quarters of an hour will give you the tools you need to achieve job search success. It's an excellent investment of your precious time.

Highly recommended!",1132099200,4,1190,4.60377358490566
