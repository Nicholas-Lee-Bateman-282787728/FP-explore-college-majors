8624481,5,B00GM5U7Z0,I've always love that show. This is perfect for my collection.,1485043200,,62,4.7272727272727275
8624482,3,B00GM5U7Z0,"Overall the set is fairly representative of the show. Red Skelton was extremely popular and the whole family could watch him, even when there were a few ""adult"" jokes, because we kids didn't understand them, so we just laughed at the funny stuff he did. The extra feature with Danny Thomas was rather ho-hum and not as appealing as his own show generally was.

The main criticism I have is about episode 5 on disk one. The title is ""How to Think up a Television Title Without Being Sued"" and the guest stars are billed as Gordon & Shelia MacRae. The show (on the disk) opens up with that title and the guest stars' names are also shown. However, when the program starts, after an obvious cut in the taping, a totally different program is played...and doesn't' have either of the stars in it. My guess is that either the media producer used footage they had assumed was correct, or they used cut footage from a different tape to fill in what was still missing, expecting viewers not to notice the difference or even care. Anyone who really followed the episode and wanted to see the advertised content does care. Not getting exactly what was promised by the media producer is basically false and very misleading. Three stars is generous in this case. Hopefully this will be corrected in future editions.",1481846400,,1302,4.636363636363637

8624486,5,B00GM5U7Z0,"Red Skelton was such an unassuming man, very talented. He didn't need to swear to entertain us. He was like so many of his era.",1402790400,2,127,4.12
8624487,2,B00GM5U7Z0,"They just didn't come through as we remembered them so they did not bring back the feelings we expected.  Our fault, really.  I would only recommend them to true aficionados of the period.  Sorry.",1399593600,4,196,4.705882352941177
8624488,4,B00GM5U7Z0,"I don't know why they call them lost episodes, they just haven't been released as of yet. Good material and as usual with Red great jokes. I saw Red in person in Danville Il. Summer of 89 and laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes almost the entire show. This is some of what I saw at the show. This is the family fun that never gets old. For all us old people out there, born in the 40's and 50's this is a chance to take your grand kids down memory lane with you. I really don't know why they don't release more of these than they do. Buy it, watch it and laugh. Remember have long sleeve shirts on to wipe the tears from you eyes.",1397433600,2,633,3.876923076923077
8624489,5,B00GM5U7Z0,"Red Skelton is a giant of comedy. Like many comic masters who rose up from stage to movies to radio to television, he is among several greats who should be celebrated more today, instead of reducing a description to his idiosyncracies.

Many in the industry, including fellow comedians, believed that only Skelton could laugh during and sketch and make it work. Harvey Korman also made it work on The Carol Burnett Show in his sketches with Tim Conway. Most recently, both Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, now heading their own late night hits, were able to pull off laughing in sketches. When it's done correctly -- and often it is not -- the laughs draws the audience into the gag. And it saves cornball jokes.

Skelton was a master mime, as you can see in these shows, particularly in the monologues. These programs are edited because of music rights (the theme song, Holiday for Strings, is not included) but the funny parts are there. Even if you've never seen Skelton's show, you will be drawn into his style within a few shows.

His characters have subtle differences, but they are indeed not all the same. George Appleby is a mild-mannered suburbanite drawn into Twilight-Zone-style predicaments, his wife played by guest stars like Vivian Vance and Eve Arden, San Fernando Red is a dishonest Senator Claghorn (or Foghorn Leghorn). Clem Kadiddlehopper is a dimwit who finds himself in important positions. And his signature character, Freddie the Freeloader (based on his father's clown character) is a hobo who makes the best of life in surreal ways.

This is pure, silly, escapism. There are some tame political jabs (from the Kennedy era in these episodes) but overall the material is like a classic cartoon, complete with gags involving gadgets built into the sets.

Relax, chill out and chuckle. Everybody can use some silly old laughs.",1394668800,3,1846,4.903846153846154
