Invasion! is one of those movies you would expect someone like Will Ferrell or Jim Carrey to be in because you never know what is going to be said or done next but whatever happens its going to be hilarious. And that is what is so good about this movie, its totally unpredictable right up to the ending. And no subject seems to be taboo including incest, homosexuality and cannibalism. But its all done in a non-offensive, Canadian kind of way, lol. I wish ""bad"" movies were all as good as Invasion!.",1256860800,2,938,5.748201438848921
1379848,4,B00004Z1F8,"Invasion! is a fun little alien invasion spoof.  The plot is extremely simple and familiar: A small town is one day invaded by flesh eating aliens, and only a small band of brave folks are willing to stand up to them.  Campbell Scott plays the famous atomic scientist(from the Atomic Institute) who upon coming to town is pursued by the cute and slightly slutty hotel owner, Ms. Fox.  Naturally, being the serious, dimwitted, pipe smoking scientist, Campbell Scott is completely oblivious to her advances until the poop hits the fan at the end of the film.  Also helping out Scott are a horny deputy and Ms. Fox's dopey, childlike brother(who she has a very questionable relationship with) played by Tom Everett Scott.  Plus, there's a mysterious ""vacuum cleaner salesman"" and a cute lady in black who ""sells banjos"" lurking about.
While maybe not sidesplittingly hilarious, it'll be hard to not find yourself giggling from time to time.  Most of the humor consists of silly oddball banter between the central characters, and I'm a sucker for silly oddball banter.  Unfortunately, the aliens are in human form and we really don't see what they look like, only very briefly in the final minutes of the movie.  The movie was co-written and co-produced by Larry Lalonde.  I'm not sure if it's the guy from Primus, but there can't be too many Larry Lalondes running around.
Definitely a good waste of time.",1242518400,2,1402,4.857142857142857
1379849,5,B00004Z1F8,"I am not a movie kind of person.  I get headaches if I go to the theater, and I would rather spend my time watching Pushing Daisies, Psych, Burn Notice, Bones, or Forensic Files, and playing on the computer at the same time, than spending 2 1/2 hours watching one single thing.

That said, this is one of the only movies that I have ever watched (willingly!) numerous times.  It's hilarious.  It's subtle, it's clever, and it's just plain weird enough to make me a VERY happy camper.

Exceptional Vista is a town that everyone thinks of when they think of podunk and redneck.  Usually we're not thinking Canada, though.  Dr. Lamonte is, on the surface, a serious man of science.  Serious men of science usually have SOME knowledge of ANYTHING, though.  When aliens invade the town, the only person who appears to know anything is Dr. Lamonte, but of course, he doesn't -- since no one knows that he's a moron, they don't know that he doesn't know what's actually going on anymore than they do.  Other than ""worldwide perdition"" -- you know, ""worldwide eating people.

Enough of the plot -- I must now get to its true awesomeness.  This movie is just... well, awesome.  I don't even know how to describe the absolute genius of it.  From the moment we meet the men named like women, the incestuous but moronic hotel owners, the sponge-seeking love interest (and hotel-owner), the movie just gets better and better.

Look, I have a pretty low-brow sense of humor in general, but this movie is so amazing that you don't realize just how cerebral it is.  I cannot do it justice with a mere review.  Sure, it's not ""Airplane"" (which was funny but not even CLOSE to the beauty of this film), and it's not Monty Python (which some people claim is too hard to get because of the whole ""british humour"" thing, and others think is the funniest comedy in existance -- but is still not close to this).  This movie is a catagory unto its own.  I wish I could somehow show you the scene where Sandy sings about Our Lady of Fatima's hat.  When Sandy tells Dr. Lamonte that she needs to be held and he grips her head... well, that's just priceless.

This is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen.  There is beauty in humor, and exquisite beauty in humor that is subtle, absurd, and off-the-wall.  If I had only one movie that I could save, if every other movie in existance were to disappear, this is the one movie I would want to keep.

Sit down with a big screwdriver in your hand (drink, not tool), get rid of all the distractions, and bring your best friend to your house.  Then put this movie on and enjoy.  Sharing it with someone who also has a sense of humor will make it even better than it allready is.  If you don't know how to laugh freely, or if you think that humor should be ""sophisticated"" in the way people found Frazier or Seinfeld funny, then you might be disappointed with this.  But if you can appreciate humor in ALL its glorious forms, if you can embrace silly, crazy and just plain absurd humor, than you will LOVE this.  Probably not as much as I do, but hopefully somewhat close.  :)",1230681600,3,3097,4.459074733096085
1379850,5,B00004Z1F8,I've lost count of how many times I've watched it. Campbell Scott and Tom Everett Scott are brilliant.  I don't remember how I first came across this movie but I make everyone I know sit through it.  Maybe the whackiest most original film I've seen.,1158364800,,249,4.511111111111111
1379851,5,B00004Z1F8,"I have to say up front, I really enjoyed this movie.  While not the same type of spoof as AIRPLANE or SCARY MOVIE, INVASION is a delightful spin on those beloved alien movies of the fifties.

Campbell Scott in a smart and shrewd performance plays an atomic scientist, studly yet simple, heroic but foolish.  Can't you just picture John Agar, Richard Denning or Marshall Thompson in these kind of roles?  Scott has some wonderful throwaway lines that you have to really tune in on to see the sharp humor.  His ""plastic buddy"" is unique and quite off the wall.  Then there's Fiona Loewi, this century's answer to Mara Corday, Faith Domergue or any of those other 50s beauties.  She sways, she swoons, she flirts and has a wonderful time.  Add a surprisingly effective Tom Everett Scott as her brother/lover, and you have a weird combination, but Scott is blisteringly funny.  There's a lot of sly humor here, and it's so wonderfully camp, I just had a good time with it.  Much of it came out of the blue but it was funny.  A delightful lost gem!",1094256000,3,1043,4.553763440860215
1379852,3,B00004Z1F8,"There are many people who feel a spoof should be at the level of Airplane, non-stop gags loosely tied into a theme.  There are less smash-on-the-head spoofs such as many of the films of Mel Brooks.  This one is somewhere in between.
The town of Exceptional Vista used to be a major manufacturer of machine nuts.  But now the factory is closed and the town is dried up.  Everyone who could leave already has.
But then some interesting things happen.  Something falls from the sky and lands near the town, a world famous nuclear scientist arrives for a vacation, all television reception is out, and there seem to be a lot of traveling salesmen about.
The aliens have landed and it is up to an unusual cast of characters to save the day.  The movie then follows a rather typical 1950's B-movie theme, complete with the aliens being defeated with a simple weapon.
Things heat up when the first body is found ""in the lumpy bumpy part of town outside of town.""  Yes, that phrase is actually used.  Repeatedly.  Much of the humor is subtle.  Pay attention to the dialogue (particularly that of the scientist) and the background visuals.  Watching our heroes being scared to pass through a bead curtain is just one instance.
This is a good spoof, but not one that will appeal to most spoof fans.  It is a little to subtle for most although I quite enjoyed it...",1053648000,5,1354,4.549586776859504
1379853,4,B00004Z1F8,"Avalanche Video deliberately retitled this film and designed the packaging to fool people into thinking it's a Zucker Brothers style non-stop gag fest like Airplane! or Top Secret.  Rather, Top of the Food Chain (the movie's real title, which still appears on the film itself) is an eccentric, amusing exercise in absurdity.  As such, it's not for everybody, but who wants to see movies that ARE for everybody?  (I know, plenty of people.)  The director,  John Paizs, is an associate of Guy Maddin, so if you like Maddin's films, you may like this.  Not that this is at all like Tales From the Gimli Hospital or Careful, but those open to intelligent, offbeat movies will probably enjoy it.  The rest of you are free to rent Scary Movie, he said, cinema snob that he is.",1046822400,9,770,4.659259259259259
1379854,5,B00004Z1F8,"This is a truly remarkable film. Originally released to theaters as ""Top of the Food Chain."" Absolutely hilarious from beginning to the astoundingly brilliant end, I highly recommend it. Loewi, Scott, and Scott are fall-down-funny as the most bizarre love triangle you are ever likely to see on film. The obsessions the town of Exceptional Vista exhibits toward fishing, sex, and TV are beyond the pale. Much of the dialog is adlibbed, to very great effect. I can't tell you how much I laughed at this wog-boggling sendup of 50's horror films like Day of the Triffids. Buy it today!",998611200,11,582,4.83
7927931,5,B00004Z1F8,"I saw this on HULU under the title ""Bottom of the Foodchain"", which is a better title for this hilariously ridiculous, fun movie. I had to add it to my sci fi collection. Great movie to watch with like minded friends on movie night.",1517875200,,232,4.295454545454546

7927934,4,B00004Z1F8,"Ok, I literally had this on my Netflix queue (sorry Amazon Prime Video) for over two years, probably longer since I removed it and replaced it in the number one spot, since I thought they forgot about me. When I was younger (much much younger) we used to make beer runs across the Mississippi river so we could buy Coors beer. Was it better then every other beer in the world, well they wouldn't sell it East of the Mississippi, so it must taste better. I don't drink Coors anymore. The movie is like this, it was the greatest movie in my mind before I saw it, it was good when I saw it, now I think I was crazy.",1453593600,,612,4.108333333333333
7927935,3,B00004Z1F8,"I absolutely love bad movies, and that includes satire of bad movies - which is what this flick is!  I have to say though.. there were some serious pacing problems. This was recommended to me by someone who knows I love the Lost Skeleton of Cadavra<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost-Skeleton-of-Cadavra/dp/B00LC92BE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra</a>&nbsp;-- which in my opinion is a superior lampooning of campy old scifi movies. If you had Lost Skeleton in one hand, and this in the other, you'd want to toss this over your shoulder into the woods and go, ""Ehhh.""

That said, Invasion has its own peculiar charm.  I give it 3 out of 5 atomic scientists - but don't be surprised if non-hardcore-bad-movie friends who you show it to run away. No offense to fans of this movie - this is a personal opinion!",1444953600,,875,5.326086956521739

7927937,5,B00004Z1F8,Weird and hilarious. I've watched it several times and each time I notice something new and hilarious in this strange and goofy sci-fi send-up.,1427241600,2,143,5.0
7927938,5,B00004Z1F8,"For those reviewers who called this a hilarious comedy,....I didn't see it as ""Hilarious"".  But it is a Classic in another sense. It spoofs The sci-fi genre of the 50's era, with continuous tongue and cheek humor, that you either can laugh at, or be offended by some of it's innuendo underlying sexuality. If you are the type of Sci-fi enthusiast, who is constantly keeping an eye out for keepers, this is definitely one of them. Odd, humorous, straight-faced. Take a 50's sci-fi Noir atmosphere, mix it with Airplane wit, and throw in a bit of Lolita. Maybe your guests may think you a bit odd, if you watch this with them, unless they enjoy odd movies, and 50's sci-fi rolled into one. The movie takes itself somewhat seriously as a Sci-fi, with a bit of oddness thrown in to take the edge off. Not for everyone. But it definitely has it's moments. If you order this, also order ""Alien Trespass""(2009). Both movies capture the spoofing of 1950's Sci-fi in their stories.  Acting is ok, and music is better than average. Must have's, for the 50's sci-fi collector.",1371513600,2,1065,4.659574468085107
7927939,5,B00004Z1F8,"I saw part of this movie on Dish a looooong time ago and it looked like a movie I'd like.  It is.  I like it.  If you like off the wall, goofy type humor you'd like this movie too.  Remember, if you look for it you have to put the ! after Invasion (like this: Invasion!) or you won't find it.  While I'm at it, another movie you'd like is ""Susan's Plan"", if you can find it.  It's pretty funny, too.  (It's also called ""Dying to Get Rich"".",1349827200,2,439,3.9204545454545454

Anyone know of a widescreen version anywhere?",1285632000,,331,4.354838709677419
