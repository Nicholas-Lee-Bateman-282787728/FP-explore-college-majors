Frankly, he likes looking at other babies and boobies, so the ""nudity"" referred to by others was a plus for my nursing babe, as were the images of little babies and kids.  And the music was great, he danced around a lot, and I enjoyed it. Little ones like him shouldn't normally watch movies and TV, I know, but we need some additional exposure to french language for him, so, if you're a francophone family living in an anglophone place, I recommend it for your toddler.
Enjoy!",1311724800,,527,4.377551020408164
8144200,1,B000I5Y8IW,"This product was not described accurately.  It is not appropriate for children.  Female nudity and behavior that was loud and violent.  When I tried to return it, I only receive my shipping fee back.i.e. I was not reimbursed for the cost of this dvd.",1277078400,,250,4.636363636363637
8144201,5,B000I5Y8IW,"My daughter loves this movie and requests it all the time; it replaced Caillou as the French film of choice.  She is currently learning French in school and nothing inspires her to work harder to understand the language than this film.  I am not a French speaker, but I can read the French subtitles enough to pick up on the story and share her excitement.  It is fast paced, visually stunning and the protagonist is an adorable pint-sized superhero.  There is some nudity, but nothing you wouldn't see in National Geographic.

She likes Kirikou and the Sorciere, but not as much.  I only wish there were more dvds in the collection.",1264896000,2,633,4.657657657657658
8144202,4,B000I5Y8IW,"I bought this movie because I watched Azur et Asmar and was blown away by it; while I suspected that Kirikou, an earlier film, would be more primitive I had not anticipated it would also be less interesting.

This is a cute fairy tale, don't get me wrong. But it isn't nearly as complex or visually interesting as Azur & Asmar.

One thing to consider, particularly if you are buying this for children -- is that this is not Disney.  This animated film depicts an african village as you might expect to see it; most of the women are only partially dressed. If you are comfortable with this aspect then Kirikou is a fine film for all ages.",1225497600,,637,4.38135593220339
8144203,5,B000I5Y8IW,"This is the sequel/prequel that takes place midway in the first storyline after Kirikou restores the water to the village. It is wonderful and I own it in both Spanish and in French. I purchased these copies in France and in Spain and I am indeed glad I did. All the children that I have introduced to Kirikou, including my 5yr old son, love the music and imagery and beg me to bring the film over and let them watch again and again. The only issue is that this film is not available in English---as of yet. The children don't mind because the imagery and music speaks volumes. I am hoping we can get an english dubb in the coming months. Wouldn't that be a treat!!!",1203379200,6,666,4.2936507936507935
