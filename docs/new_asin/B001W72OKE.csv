8347060,2,B001W72OKE,"First off, make no mistake, I think Mike Holmes is great. He knows his stuff and explains it well.  This DVD is simply a compilation of three different episodes from the first two seasons: ""Botched Basement"" and Lamin'aint (Season 1) and Jacking the Box (Season 2).  Each of the 3 episodes are 22 minutes for a total run time of 66 minutes. There are no DVD basics (such as closed captioning) much less extras. Also, because these were from before Mike's show was filmed in HD, this DVD is in SD.  I'm not complaining; however, all of this information would have been useful to have in the product description.

All of that being said, Mike's advice is great and will really help people finishing their basements, especially in older homes. I give Mike 5 stars, but because of the lack of description of the DVD which might lead people (like me) to believe that it was more than simply pasting 3 episodes together, I am forced to rate the DVD 2 stars.

For MUCH more detail, and more original material get Mike's book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Make-It-Right-Attics-And-Basements/dp/B003SYF13Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Make It Right Attics And Basements</a>.""  This was very helpful.

Also, a word to those looking for in-detail information on basement/foundation waterproofing (as I was): there is some good basic information and some fantastic tips in the DVD as well as book, but they're far from a how-to. Both of these products are much more geared to whole basement finishing.",1318377600,18,1528,5.186991869918699
8347061,5,B001W72OKE,If you have a problem with your home and need to fix it.  Holmes can help.  This is great material to keep in your library to use when you need it.,1294963200,,147,3.7096774193548385
