3987071,5,B002U2Q0FK,"The Brits have done it again!  I am a somewhat biased reviewer as I tend to enjoy BBC programs and other television programs and/or movies that come from Great Britain.  That being said, this is one of the most enjoyable DVD's I have seen for children in a long time. I initially rented it on a whim and loved it so much I bought several of the DVD's with multiple episodes.  I come from a rural setting, my family actually has sheep, cows, and working dogs, so most ""pet"" movies drive me crazy.  This was so great from the voice talents to the use of real working dogs instead of ""actors"".  I love that you can tell the dogs are actually doing what the show is talking about.  This is a great fun alternative to the obnoxious cartoons and boring ""talking"" dogs that are CG.  Great product!",1342569600,2,790,4.333333333333333
3987072,5,B002U2Q0FK,"I would not miss even one of the DVD, Mist-Sheepdog Tales. I wish there were more avilable. I have a Border Collie, and am actually taking lessons in Sheep herding. This makes these stories so special to me. I am 56 years old, and I love Mist. They are heart warming, gut funny, with precision sheep herding. The stories are written with very clever talent by the real owner of Borough Farm in Devon England. The are simply delightful, and perfect for the whole family to watch.
This DVD has Fern learning a lesson,and teaching a lesson, and Mist in her second sheep herding trial, and Jake and a golf ball and his fear of ducks that is a quack up! There is also a story about Macpherson the Ram, and Swift's getting older. These are real sheepdogs, at their real home with their real life Boss(owner). Thank you for asking me to write a review. It was a pleasure.",1307145600,8,864,4.40625
