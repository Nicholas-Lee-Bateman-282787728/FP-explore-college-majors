7584667,5,B019WMLLQI,"After trying two of Cathe's other workouts in Cathe's new ICE series I wanted to give this a shot and it doesn't disappoint!  The warm-up doesn't really feel like a warm-up as you're already throwing punches but it gets the blood flowing and your muscles ready to go.  The main routine consists of kickboxing segments combined with cardio drills, which really raises the heart rate.  Alternating jabs, uppercuts, and punching combinations with knee raises are all there, along with front, side and back kicks.  Your core is being worked the entire time but you're having too much fun to notice!

The cardio portions include jumping jacks, jump ropes, fast paced shuffles, leaping lunge punches, forward and back jump squats, etc.  Some of the moves are very high impact (one example being snow angel jumping jacks) so I had to do a lot of modifications but Cathe smartly kept the drills manageable.  Between the kickboxing and cardio your entire body is utilized to maximize the burn and calorie expenditure.

A ""muscle meltdown"" focusing on triceps is one bonus feature; there are three sets of five exercises that include overhead tricep presses, tricep dips utilizing a step, kickbacks, lying tricep extensions and close grip raises.  Cathe works with 12 pounds but you can tailor the weights to suit your needs (I was able to do the overhead presses and kickbacks with 12's but had to drop down to 8's for the extensions and grip raises).

Another bonus is a ""blizzard blast,"" which consists of 14 minutes of non-stop cardio.  One ""icy core"" routine is also thrown in for the abdominals.

If you're looking for a fun kickboxing DVD you've found it!  Highly recommend.",1457049600,5,1671,4.903914590747331
7584668,4,B019WMLLQI,"Great Workout!  I love the music and the workout!  I was able to heavy up on the tricep weights by using one 25 lb.  I have to go down in weights for the lying extensions.  I hate doing triceps with one heavy weight in each arm.  That is my only complaint with this program.  Pros:  Great motivating music, great premix options, new moves.  Cons:  I do not like using heavier weight per arm.  It stresses my joints.  Cathe used to never do these this way until lately.  All in all great workout. I enjoy doing it.  I could care less about what the cast wears.",1456790400,,559,4.20952380952381
7584669,5,B019WMLLQI,"Workout time: 47:59
Equipment:  5 & 12 lb. dumbbells, step and mat.
Muscle Meltdown: Triceps
Blizzard: Kickbox-inspired moves
Outfits:  Teal tops with black bottoms

The music was techno-music, which I normally find annoying, but I was enjoying the workout so much that it didn't bother me.

The workout consists of a punching combo, followed by a lower body and upper body blast, and then some recovery moves. There isn't a lot of impact in this workout.

Some of the moves include:  upper, body shot, elbow strike; lunge knee up, side to side agitate with knee up.

I couldn't match Cathes weight for the triceps.",1452988800,4,615,4.855769230769231
8746170,5,B019WMLLQI,I loved this workout.  I like to mix up the intensity of workouts through the week.  This workout is in the middle.  Which of course is recommended after a really intense workout the day before.  The moves are not complex but still feel like your getting your cardio in!!,1523750400,,271,4.469387755102041
8746171,2,B019WMLLQI,Nothing new. Recommend using weighted gloves for more of a challenge.,1523145600,,69,5.363636363636363

8746173,3,B019WMLLQI,"This is the second one I've done in this series.  These workouts are SOLID intermediate.  Like another reviewer said, they will not leave you gasping (maybe at one or two points) but these are definitely not for the super advanced.  That being said, I REALLY did not care for this workout at all.  I will stick to Turbo Jam which gives me a much better workout..  The music is off beat, the workout, in my opinion is unbalanced.  Crazy and monotonous punching with a little kick and cardio thrown in.  I can't see myself reaching for this one again.  I also did the icy core and loved it.  I felt it but it didn't kill me.",1490140800,,622,4.293103448275862
8746174,5,B019WMLLQI,Great workout! Cather nailed this one!,1487030400,,38,5.5
8746175,5,B019WMLLQI,"The dvd arrived along the other ones.  The other was perfect and worked great.  This one only showed the initial FBI warning and medical disclaimer and the rest of the dvd was blank.  It's package was intact, brand new.

Update: I contacted Amazon and in record time they replaced the dvd.  I received it today and it was in perfect shape.  The workout itself is very challenging and offers so many combinations and premixes.  Cathe did it again.  Thank you Amazon.",1483920000,,465,4.654320987654321
8746176,5,B019WMLLQI,Cathe does it again. Great workout and I love the music.,1477440000,,56,4.181818181818182
8746177,5,B019WMLLQI,"This workout is not difficult in intensity at all, but you are moving the entire time and it feels like you are getting a good workout!  I have so many of Cathe's dvds and some are more difficult and I love that, but sometimes you want a good workout where you are not gasping for breath or celebrating the end of a move that is killer!  :)  One of those love/hate kind of things.  This workout has many newer moves to me and some that i am familiar with from other Cathe dvds.  The majority of the dvd consists of punches but she does such a great variety that it doesn't get boring.  The premixes are awesome!  So far my favorite is premix 5.  The cardio blasts raise your heart rate enough that you know you are getting a good workout, but you won't be gasping for air.  I had fun doing this workout and that is the most important thing along with getting a good workout.  I would recommend this dvd to anyone, but if you are are more advanced you may want to use it on a day you have less energy like I did.  Or get weighted boxing gloves to do the punches with, or hold small hand weights while punching. Great purchase!",1468627200,8,1125,4.162037037037037
8746178,5,B019WMLLQI,"Love this girl :-) and she has done it again.  This routine is excellent.  Love the music choice in this one most of all, that alone encourages me to pick it up.  Nice to have the various mix routines as well, some days we are not as motivated as others and this allows you to pick your routine based on how much do you want to do today.",1459209600,2,337,3.926470588235294
8746179,5,B019WMLLQI,"Great workout.  I love the way the dvd is set up with all the premixes and extras.  It's a challenging workout that I find is more advanced with modifications for individuals on a more intermediate level.  I hesitated to buy it at first because it's classified as intermediate, but don't be fooled...it's tough.  I had to use a single heavy weight for part of the bonus tricep work and tens for the lying extensions.  I love the extra blast too which was non stop cardio but fun cardio...never boring.  Great workout for anyone.",1458604800,5,528,4.623655913978495
