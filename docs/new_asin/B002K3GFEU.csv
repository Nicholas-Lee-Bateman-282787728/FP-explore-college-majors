Was terrible not worth the effort",1501027200,,70,4.461538461538462
8371734,1,B002K3GFEU,"So, this is probably one of the most awful workout videos ever. For those that are at all fit, you will become bored quickly as she teaches and when she has you actually do the moves, it is for such a short time that it is basically a warm up. I feel like I just wasted 30 mins of my life. For those that are not in shape- you will probably injure yourself trying this because you must be strong to keep proper form. I actually tossed this video in the trash-I have never done that before.... it's awfullllllll",1403827200,2,510,4.161616161616162

8371736,3,B002K3GFEU,I have no rythm - that could be part of the problem.  I have four other dvds of her's and she is great.  Try the cardioblaster - it is the best.,1356393600,,144,3.6129032258064515
