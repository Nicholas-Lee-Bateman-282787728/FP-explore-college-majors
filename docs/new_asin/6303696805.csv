717878,5,6303696805,"""Strawberry and Chocolate"" is the first Cuban film I have seen in years.... It is certainly the only one that openly discusses things like communism,  homosexuality, and political immigration.
Although on the  surface, this film talks about politics and social ideology, most  importantly, it is about people: their happiness, their problems, and often  their loneliness.  Characters' problems are not blaimed solely on the  communist regime. Rather, authors locate roots of these problems and  solutions to them within the characters themselves.
The two main  characters [David and Diego], who initially don't seem to have anything in  common, end up loving each other.  All they needed to do, in order to  discover things they can share, is to look deep within themselves. One of  the greatest things they share, is their un-dying love for their  mother-land, Cuba: each man loves in his own way, but they are in it  together...
It is important that David and Diego do not end up being  lovers [as it would probably happen in a Hollywood-ish film], because the  bond they share is much more powerful than any physical  atttraction could  ever be. This bond has blossomed in the place, where before there was  nothing besides fear and hatred.
All characters [the two men, as well as  ""Nancy"", Diego's lonely and unlucky-in-love neighbor] have their  own dignity, spirituality, and inner beauty, despite their human faults and  peculiarities.  These people are not saints, but they are DECENT people.  Being together, however, makes them even stronger in their decency.  They  cling to each other, as only people on the sinking ship would, because they  know that they must be together in order to survive.
This film makes its  viewers feel deep emotions as well as entertains them with sophisticated,  smart humor and actors' highly-charged performances. It also leaves very  powerful images with the viewers for a long time.
It still breaks my  heart to remember Diego talking to his refrigerator and Nancy being  hospitalized...
""Strawberry and Chocolate"" is a lesson in  universal humanity.",960422400,17,2094,5.173652694610778

Diego es un hombre muy fuerte, qui tienes mucho energia, amor por  todos, tambien gustas los hombres.  Nancy, German, Diego, y David son la  familia moderna.  Triste, felice, rico, y duro -eso es este historia, y eso  es el mundo!

718037,4,6303696805,"This movie is great! I was in high school when I first saw it and it was very interesting. Now, after seen it 10 years later I understood why. It is very funny, dramatic and the script and theme is very current. The performances were excellent and the scenes filmed in Cuba were fantastic. I recommend this movie very much.",1044835200,,323,4.4
718038,5,6303696805,"Okay, never mind the big quote on the coverbox calling this movie ""a breezy charmer.""  It's anything but, thank you very much.  This misdirection continues the fine tradition of vapid US marketers thinking they need to cloak serious foreign movies as wacky comedies in order to get people here to buy or rent them.  [Other egregious examples include ""East is East"" and ""Brassed Off.""]
That out of the way, this is a great film about very serious subjects - homosexuality in the face of repression, depression, expulsion, threat of jail, attempts at suicide, etc.  A great take on life under Castro by directors Juan Carlos Tabo and Toms Gutirrez Alea.
The film itself is a tour de force by Jorge Perugorra as the openly gay Diego.  And if you don't think that's great acting, I suggest you follow up this movie with Tabo & Gutirrez Alea's last joint effort, 'Guantanamera,' in which Perugorra goes completely to the other end of the spectrum with an excellent portrayal of a macho truck driver.",1042070400,,994,4.7894736842105265
718039,5,6303696805,"Despite what the poster might imply , this is anything but a harmless romantic comedy . This wonderful Cuban film describes the strong friendship which is being slowly developed between gay artlover Diego and communist student David . Their different sexual preferences and motivations towards each other stand at first as an obstacle to their relationship yet as time goes by , our heroes get to know each other and gain a new prespective about life , human relationships , political values and morality . Add to all this a female neighbour with a past full of sins and a heart of gold and what you get is a must-see film which combines perfectly sweetness and wit .
Strawberry And Chocolate Touches many different subjects ( love , sexuallity , political beliefs ) with a tender discreet way . It's one of the best foreign films i've seen and surely the best one about Cuba . Once more i will disagree with people who consider this "" one of my favourite gay films "" because for me this movie is so much more : an ode to male frienship against all odds , an advertise for Cuban people and spirit internationally if you ask me .",1033948800,5,1128,4.480582524271845
718040,5,6303696805,"I FOUND THIS MOVIE TO BE HAUNTINGLY UNIQUE AND ENTERTAINING. IT  IS ABOUT A HOMOPHOEBIC,NAIVE COLLEGE STUDENT WHO'S INTO COMMUNISM AND WHO RUNS INTO AN OPEN GAY MAN WHO HAS A FEW THINGS TO TEACH HIM ABOUT LIFE, THE ARTS AND THE PASSION OF LIFE. YOU WILL LOVE JORGE PERUGORRIA'S PERFORMANCE AS DAVID (THE GAY GUY).PERUGORRIA IS STRANGELY MESMERIZING AND LEAVES YOU WANTING TO STUDY HIS CHARACTER EVEN FURTHER. A MOVIE I THOUGHT I'D HATE I ENDED UP RENTING OVER AND OVER JUST TO SEE PERIGORRIA'S PERFORMANCE. DON'T MISS THIS ONE! HE'S GOING TO BE A GREAT STAR!!",1030060800,,559,4.704081632653061
718041,4,6303696805,"Fans of foreign films (and I number myself among them) have to admit, when pressed, that they too are only catching a glimpse or two into the culture portrayed onscreen.  I know next to nothing about Cuba--to my eternal embarrassment--well, only what every other American my age does...the Bay of Pigs, the Missile Crisis,  Ricky Ricardo... Not a lot really.
Seriously, though, I had always understood that gays in Cuba pretty much were routinely rounded up and sent to harvest sugarcane...if they were lucky.  ""Strawberry and Chocolate"" creates a somewhat more nuanced picture.  The gay writer, Diego, portrayed by Jorge Perugorria, has good reason to be paranoid of the government, but he is able--at least in late 90s Havana--to have a life, work and keep a well-decorated apartment.
What he doesn't have is a significant other, and while he doesn't exactly succeed in wooing a young, unsophisticated idealistic college student(Vladimir Cruz), he does manage to engage the younger man on a platonic level, exposing his young charge to the world of poetry, art and ideas.  And to romance, too, indirectly, since he fixes the younger man with his eccentric female friend, Nancy.
""Strawberry and Choclate"" offers us some insight into another world only ninety miles from our shores.  It's themes of friendship, love and betrayal are, of course, universal.  But it's understated, benignly cynical worldview is probably uniquely Cuban.  What do you make of a betrayal that is really almost accidental--more due to the zealotry of one's friends than to one's own rapidly evolving beliefs.
Ultimately, a Bildungsfilm, this remains the younger man's story.  He goes from peasant, to college student, grateful to his Communist regime for that opportunity, but his older friend provides him with a education beyond the socialist curriculum.  It's a remarkable insight into a society that has not stopped evolving, despite the rigidity of its government--one that has not lost its flair for life and for color, despite the socialist drabness that it has to pay homage to.",1008201600,4,2063,5.186746987951807
718042,5,6303696805,"Finally, a movie that deals with homosexuality in Cuba. This issue, which has been absent from both public discourse and the Cuban cinema, is dealt with in surprisingly clear terms in this neo-classic. The director's treatment of the gay protagonist, Diego, was fair and responsible. The other characters were typically Cuban: beautiful, intelligent, and witty.",1006646400,,361,5.581818181818182
718043,3,6303696805,"As a Cuban, I can testify that this film is a very accurate testimony of the civil rights dilemma inside the communist country. The movie is not, however, so politic; rather it is about friendship and human relationships, and it is fun as well.
I also must testify that anti-government critics contained in this film cannot be taken as a proof of freedom of expression in Cuba. I think that freedom of expression is when critic is the rule and not the exception. This movie is, in that sense, the exception and not the rule.",1005004800,3,524,4.526315789473684
718044,4,6303696805,"A sad Cuban film about a gay intellectual who befriends a student who is very devoted to the causes and ideals of Communist Cuba. He, however, has to begin to open his eyes to the realities of modern day Cuba when his friend is harassed and maligned... and when it is clear that the friend is so harassed even though he too is patriotic and loves Cuba... just not Communist Cuba. The young man also begins a love affair with an older woman, a friend of the gay man. A description of the film won't really do it justice. The performances themselves convey a lot of emotion and also provide thought provoking angles from which to survey the Cuban situation.",985564800,2,655,4.466666666666667
718045,5,6303696805,"...and this exquisitely acted film is a beautiful, sensitive, work of art. Mario Garcia Joya's cinematography is gorgeous, and so is the soundtrack by Jos Maria Vitier, using piano pieces by Ignacio Cervantes.
Jorge Perugorria is Diego, a gay man who loves his country, but is unable to express himself in it. It's an extraordinary performance that shouldn't be missed. Vladimir Cruz is also excellent as David, his straight friend, and Mirta Ibarra ! Her ""Nancy"" is so touching. Her short scene with ""The godfather"" brought me to tears...and for those of us who became addicted to the oh so romantic telenovela ""Laberintos de Passion"" starring Francisco Gattorno, here he is, eight years younger, doing a great job as David's fiercly communist friend...so why is that photo of James Dean by the mirror ? Ah ! All those little inconsistencies that make us who we are...
This is a tender gem of a film and really needs more than one viewing to fully appreciate...especially if you are reading the subtitles, and can't give 100% attention to the magnificent acting.",974851200,10,1063,4.944134078212291
718046,5,6303696805,"""Strawberry and Chocolate"" is a great subjective look at the Cuban Revolution.  Most of the film is critical of it, but there are times when it shows positive aspects of it.  It also shows a compassionate look at a man unwanted by the communist uprising because of his sexual identity (gay) and his education (very much of it).  But besides the political and human rights perspective, this movie is interesting and grand in plot and direction.  Tomas Gutierrez Alea is one of the best directors in Cuba as well as, in my opinion, the world.  This movie is another one spurned by the product of his genius.  I was captivated by the relationship between intellectual, sensitive Diego and young, impressionable David.  I was glad that David's ideas and personality changed and grew a lot by the end, and the movie was a very convincing portrait of a young man's maturing.  This movie will give you a reason to hope that things can always get better, and that truly good people do exist in the world.  Although it is sad and frustrating at times, because it is the following of a man doomed to be rejected in his own country, it carries an underlying message of hope for the human race.  I recommend this and all of the films directed by Alea to anyone interested in Cuba, the revolution, and just plain great films.",973036800,17,1312,4.592274678111588

My only complaint is why there hasn't been a DVD release of this movie just yet!  With such vastly overrated mediocrities such as ""Like Water For Chocolate"" or ""Babette's Feast"" now available, it should only be a matter of time.
A phenomenally enjoyable film, whatever your personal preference.",1058140800,3,506,5.325

From  the amount of foreign films I've seen, there have been some outstanding ones like Central Station, City Of Lost Children, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Like Water for Chocolate and Amelie.  I guess I hold all foreign (subtitled) films to this high standard.  The actor who played Diego, Jorge Perrugoria was wonderful though.  He's one of those few actors that uses his eyes to convey so much internal action.  Over all, I'm not saying the film was bad, but it wasn't one I'd watch again and again.

7853838,5,6303696805,"The Cuban film, ""Fresa y Chocolate,"" is the story of friendship between a young student (a loyal member of the Communist Party), and a gay political activist, who is critical of the government's censorship. It is an amazing film for a number of reasons.  First, it presents a balanced and somewhat critical view of the Cuban political system.  This is surprising since it was co-produced by ICAIC, essentially the official Cuban film production company.  Second, though the main characters start out as stereotypes, they develop into very real people who go beyond what the audience would expect.
Considered by many to have been a major catalyst in improving the treatment of gays in Cuba; this film presents a rich and interesting view of Cuban society.",1046908800,21,754,5.016
7853839,4,6303696805,"Strawberry and chocolate, I found to be enjoyable and moving.  It's surface is presented humorously, while serious issues are the underlying foundation of the film.  The friendship between the two main characters, and the confict of a nation in distress create a link between two seemingly unrelated issues.  The casting is a defenite film strength, although the occasional use of unusual focal points are visually distracting.  However, with dialoge, script and happy camera placemment, the film is well worth the time.",1045440000,,520,5.382716049382716
