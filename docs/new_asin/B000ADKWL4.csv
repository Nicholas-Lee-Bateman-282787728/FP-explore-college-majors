The story starts off Soule, Korea with a dirty detective who never arrested anyone in his carrer.  He crosses path with this sociopath. (how that happens is very funny) The detective doesn't know he just murder two people till a week later.  So he's determined to prove to his superiors that he's the guy. No one takes him seriously, because they know he's a big MESS up.  He not the sharpest tool in the shed, he's hard headed, and one tuff cop.  He probally one of the dumbest cops around but this movie is not a spoof type movie.  It have a lot of great one liners and the action isn't what you expect from a Asian movie.  There in no karate, some gunplay, but a lot of people getting getting knocked off there block.  All fights are street styled fighting. When I seen the detective in this movie, he reminds me of Charles Bronson as far as being tough and taking no crap from anybody.  He also reminds me of Chow Yun Fat in those old Hong Kong films when he goes off on just about anybody. You'll be say he's bad a## but why can't he just do this or that to get this guy. That where some of the comedy comes in. It a different type of movie if you're tired of seeing the same old tired movies.",1133308800,6,1288,4.136546184738956

Two questionable characters are on a collision course in this cat and mouse thriller.
A real korean classic up there with oldboy, out of justice, and man from nowhere. I had no problems with this film, and unlike some Korean action films, its continuity was impeccable.",1347840000,,399,4.555555555555555

8077984,4,B000ADKWL4,"Our boy QT loves Asian cinema, his film are influenced by samurai and martial arts themed films. However, the South Korean film ""PUBLIC ENEMY"" seemed to have turned the tables on the acclaimed director; this film has the coolness and grittiness of a Tarantino film. I've read once that ""South Korea makes better Hollywood films than Hollywood itself"". This film is another testament to that claim, (aside from the fantastic gangster film; ""A Bittersweet Life"") this film reminds us of the things that made us love to watch movies in the first place. Director Kang Wu-Seok's outing may have some similarities to ""Nowhere to Hide"", but it is a far cry from the usual gangster films that comes out of South Korea ever.

Ruthless, unkempt cop named Chul-Joong Kang is not your typical everyday detective. Chul-Joong's activities have a lot of illegal stuff that anyone would wonder whether he is a cop or a gangster. After his partner's suicide pending an Internal affairs investigation, Chul-Joong decides to try to become a good cop for a change. Being a public servant is somewhat new to him, and his superior often mock him about his lack of arrests.
One rainy night, Chul-Joong runs into a ruthless killer in a raincoat in a small alley and the two form an odd connection. A week later, dead bodies of an elderly couple are found with multiple stab wounds. Chul-Joong meets the couple's son, Cho Gyu-Hwan, he has the intuition that Cho is the killer but he has no evidence. Cho is actually the cold emotionless killer that he ran across with in the rain. The inevitable showdown between a dirty cop and a psycho-killer unfolds in a very personal manner.

""Public Enemy"" easily sidesteps the usual cop vs. gangster that seemed to have become the thread in Korean crime drama lately. The film is an intelligent, gritty, humorous, well-structured film of the unlikeable dirty cop against a handsome homicidal maniac bent on murder. The film is not overly exaggerated and quite intense to follow. There is a lot of violence and blood that ""gorehounds"" will definitely be attracted to the film, and what's more fascinating is the violence is well-filmed and creatively shot that the sequences have the effect on a psychological level. Folks who enjoy realistic violence will definitely embrace ""Public Enemy"".

The film also boasts of an excellent script that may even make QT a little jealous. The dialogue is cool, clever and smart, there is a lot of comedic moments in the proceedings that has the same effective dark, sly humor that films like ""Pulp Fiction"" have made quite popular. There isn't much that goes on after the 10 minute mark, the director lets the audience form an attachment to its two main characters by taking its time. The two leads become well-developed that the viewer will definitely be amused and repulsed at the same by the escapades of our anti-hero; Chul-Joong (played by Seol Gyeong-Gu), while his antagonist, the psychopathic rich businessman (played by Lee Seong Jae) is suave, handsome with a bad temper will surely wow its female audience. Quite ironic that the villain is the handsome antagonist who emulates a likeable charisma while the ""hero"" is actually the character meant to be quite unlikeable. The two are opposite extremes in every way, but for some odd reason, they are exactly alike. While ""Nowhere to Hide"" is a film that depended on  nice visuals and cinematography, ""Public Enemy"" is superior in every way because the film is more character-driven and plot-oriented. Some people may argue that the film may need some editing, it is long at 135 minutes but NEVER for a moment did it feel boring.

Lee Seong Jae (Kick the Moon) makes an excellent performance as the killer. The man exudes that creepy and unsettling charisma that gives his character a lot of depth. His facial features are indeed disturbing when he performs the murderous acts of violence, that even his handsome features become overshadowed by his frightening aura. Seol Gyeong-Gu is the main hero of the film; at first glance, you will immediately see that there is just something not right with his character. His violent actions aren't always justified, but from then on, Chul-Joong will likely grow on you. His persistence and fortitude in pursuing his ""gut feeling"" is to be admired that even though Chul-Joong is edgy and needs a lot of lessons about morality and good manners, you can't help but tend to be attached to him by the film's final act. The chemistry between the two works well that film lives around their interactions.

PUBLIC ENEMY is a worthwhile film that is a prime example as to why Korea has become a force to be reckoned with in great film-making. Dark, intense but never loses its comedic momentum, the film is a successful ""play on genres"" that those love this type of a blending of ""noirish"" coolness and sly humor will be satisfied. Treat yourself to ""Public Enemy"" and you won't be sorry.

HIGHLY Recommended! [4 - Stars]",1208563200,5,4964,4.860520094562648

8077986,4,B000ADKWL4,"Woo-Suk Kang directs ""Public Enemy"" with a different sense of rhythm and style from our Hollywood products.  His characters are vivid.  There is a logical story line, punctuated with some great fight sequences.  Some combat seems to be thrown in because it'd be a nice time for a fight.  Sol Kyung-gu who won a Best Actor award from the Seattle Film Festival for 2003's ""Oasis"" plays the bumbling cop who takes bribes and would rather bash a criminal's head to smithereens rather than bring him into the station and have to do the paperwork.  While all the other cops have desk drawers full of paper, his drawer contains only one pencil.  Lee Seong-jae plays the heavy Gyu-hwan in the movie.  He is a corporate type who is completely amoral as he wheels and deals.  Unfortunately, his aging father wishes to buy and orphanage and help children rather than invest in one of Gyu-hwan's schemes.  Gyu-hwan decides on the obvious solution and shows up in a raincoat on a stormy night and slashes his parents to death, thus inheriting the money.  As a criminal, Lee Seong-jae is handsome and sinister.  I didn't particularly understand the necessity for the male nudity in the first part of the film.  We get a backward glance at Gyu-hwan in the shower performing some manual manipulation.  This is followed by a hot tub scene where Chul-Choong's partner who is tattooed from head to foot showers and gets into a naked fight with his partner.  That's followed by an odd scene where the tattoo cop scrubs his partner's back.  Culturally, this must have a different significance in Korea.  Some of Woo-Suk Kang's scene selections seemed to make the film unnecessarily long.  There's a sequence where Kang Chul-Cheoong who's been put back on the street as a beat cop stops the wife of Gyu-hwan for a traffic violation.  He accepts a bribe and then crumples up the money.  However, the wife connection doesn't lead him toward catching Gyu-hwan; it just seems tacked onto the plot.  Oh Seung-myeong and Oh Seung-tae as the father and mother of Gyu-hwan do nice jobs as their son's victims.  However, while it may be a bit long, the film is filled with good characters and riveting action.  Enjoy!",1147132800,8,2186,4.773333333333333
