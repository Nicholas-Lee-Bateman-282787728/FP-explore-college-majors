2384121,5,B000AARKEO,"I am a Gundam maniac and I have seen ever gundam series ever created. This is probably one of the best, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam is a classic gundam series. I used to love gundam I saw the most of the series before they ever came to America, and incidentally Mobile suit gundam wing is not the best Gundam series, it is in my opinion the worst. Zeta Gundam has a strong plot of love and war, whereas Gundam Wing has a bunch of pretty boys running around being annoying with no real misssion. Gundam seed also has an annoying plot, because the characters won't shut up about bringing peace to the world. The only reason I watched Gundam Seed , and Gundam seed Destiny was for the Mecha. But anyway if you like Gundam Wing you won't like this series, but if you know what a real gundam series is supposed to be like I highly recommend that you get this DVD, plus it has ten episodes per DVD.",1132531200,8,888,4.229411764705882
2384122,5,B000AARKEO,"This is it.  If you haven't figured it out by now, Gundam Wing/Seed use Sailor-Moon looking protagonists, who basically mimic and steal plots from the Original Gundam and Z Gundam.  It's really stupid and sickening for people who have followed Gundam from the mid 80's to present.  That's why Bandai is appeasing our interests with things like the Z Gundam movie Trilogy and MS Igloo.  Another stupid Gundam series is G Gundam.  Don't watch it.  After you watch Gundam and Z Gundam, you might, you just might notice that the same stories and even look alike robots are used in Gundam Wing/Seed.  Then, anyone with a brain will realize that Gundam Wing/Seed sux.

Bottom line is that Zeta Gundam has the best story line, and in my opinion animation that is good enough for present day.  If you think Batman the Animated Series had passable animation, then Zeta Gundam should be fine, even if it's 20 years old.",1132185600,6,909,4.7025316455696204
2384123,5,B000AARKEO,"Alright, to start us off, if you want fancy production values and shallow characters, just do yourself a favor and get Gundam Wing or SEED. Otherwise, Zeta is the choice for you.

  In my opinion the best Gundam series I have seen, out of 0079, SEED, Wing, 0083, 08th MS Team (this is close, though), G Gundam, Chars Counter Attack, and whatever else I may be forgetting. The characters are endearing- when the famous ""kill em all Tomino"" decides he wants to knock off a character, it touches you in a way that few other Animes can. When a character dies, it molds the characters around them to make them even better.

  Note, while this show has some lighthearted moments, it has very serious and dramatic ovetones that might just leave you feeling depressed and moved at the same time. The mobile suit battles are fantastic, and while the production values may not be as high as SEED, Zeta Gundam spearing a HiZack with it's Mega Hyper Launcher's built in beam saber still looks very cool ;) As you delve farther into the series, more awesome mobile suits and even better characters make appearances that shape the the ones you will come to love.

  The story, as if you couldn't figure it out from my other comments, is fantastic. This is not some angst-fest like Wing, not some meaningless cliche like SEED turned out to be- it is something that will bring you into the gundam world like never before, jerk on some heart strings, make you sit on the edge of your seat, and maybe even make you shed a tear (I just cannot bring myself to spoil it for you).

  Overall, Zeta Gundam is my favorite Gundam series of all time. Don't let the fact that it's ""old"" scare you away, this is Tomino at his best and will leave you feeling, after you have seen the series in it's entirety, wanting more and feeling thankful you have been able to experience an anime of this caliber. True Gundam fans should not pass this up!",1131408000,13,1914,4.484149855907781
2384124,1,B000AARKEO,this show is a disgrace to gundam on the level of SD Gundam (not quite that bad =P). Just buy gundam seed (much better than gundam wing),1131408000,,136,4.074074074074074
2384125,5,B000AARKEO,"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam is quite possibly the greatest Gundam series, let alone sci-fi show, ever made. Unfortunately, too many people are put off by it's relatively old production values to give it a second-thought. This is a shame, because Zeta Gundam's story is still a powerful one, and is one of the most engaging space operas available on the market. The world of Zeta Gundam is real and gritty, not like the exaggerated and overtly-angsty Gundam Wing. To compare Zeta to Wing and proclaim Wing to be the greater series would be equivalent to saying that Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is much better than Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. Episode I may look better and may be newer, but that doesn't make up for the fact that Episode V is an infinitely more enjoyable movie. Zeta is truly a series for a mature mind, one that can appreciate superior story-telling at the cost of limited animation. If this sort of anime is your thing, then you have no reason not to enjoy Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam.",1130457600,14,1024,4.601092896174864

2384127,5,B000AARKEO,"After the successful release of both Mobile Suit Gundam and Turn A Gundam, RightStuf has graced us with my personal favorite series. Like the others, this series was dubbed and released by Bandai but has since gone out of print. Zeta Gundam (or Z Gundam) remains one of the most classic and important UC stories right beside Mobile Suit Gundam.

This release covers 3 Blu-ray Discs (also available on DVD) and goes from Episode 1 to 25. Finally having this series in Bluray is a huge plus even though we still don't have the original opening due to copyright issues. It does feature a very nice English dub, however.

Overall, a great release for an awesome show!",1464566400,16,663,4.6581196581196584

Light on extra features. Great artwork on the discs. At an average of 2 dollars an episode, I say that this is a great buy for any gundam fan.

Zeta gundam is the best of all the series as far as story goes, so it should be in any mecha-fans collection. And I would buy it sooner rather than later, as prices for these things can go up to $300 after a few years due to limited printing.",1460505600,3,711,4.007042253521127

2384138,4,B000AARKEO,"I pre-ordered this back in December and have received my copy few days ago.

Here is a link to my Gundam 0079 Blu-Ray review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RV5YE6OTRJ11/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TOVA98&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=2625373011&store=movies-tv#wasThisHelpful

VIDEO:
As for Zeta Gundam, this is the first time Zeta Gundam is released on Blu-Ray in the USA. The previous release was DVD only by Bandai, and since I do not own the previous release, I cannot compare the two but I can compare it to the Japanese Blu-Ray since I have copies of those.

The video quality is a 7.5 or 8/10. I was a bit disappointed to find the quality inferior to the First Gundam 0079 Blu-Ray. Although the video isn't as DNR'd, the overall image quality is very soft, smooth, and it looks like someone just resized the SD source and called it a day. It's not bad, but if you're a fan I am sure you will support it!

The Japanese released the complete series on 10 discs(about 5-6 episodes per disc), and it seems like Sunrise will be releasing it on 6 discs(about 9 episodes per disc) for North America. I compared it to the Japanese box set and I couldn't see any differences in compression or any artifacts introduced. I can't complain thought! The Japanese set was about 500 dollars, while the USA version will end up being under $100 dollars for the complete series( although the USA version is a ""budget"" release, the quality is identical to its Japanese counterpart).

Japanese video size: 7GB-8GB
USA video size: 5GB-6GB

AUDIO:
The audio is in Linear PCM format (lossless audio) 48Hz/16-bit/1536kbps for both Japanese and English dubs (same format as the Japanese blu-ray box set).

The audio for the Japanese track is in 2.0 mono, while the English track gets a 2.0 stereo mix(the volume of the music and sfx in the English track are a bit lower than the Japanese but it's not that noticeable).

One thing to note: the OP and ED themes have been replaced by instrumental tracks - the rights for the original themes could not be secured.

SUBTITLES:
I believe Sunrise recycled the old BANDAI subtitles. I don't see a reason for them to waste money on a whole new translation. You get a full songs and signs track for the English dub, and you also get a full subtitle track for the Japanese dub.

EXTRAS:
Clean Opening and Ending

2384139,2,B000AARKEO,"Such a waste.  The One Year War storyline worked as a trilogy of movies because each was over two hours in length.  With these reworked Zeta Gundam movies, each is instead around 90 minutes, not nearly enough to do such a legendary anime series justice.  As a result things move at such a pace that those who've never seen the original series will likely have no idea what's going on (and the first battle in space is the best example of this).

With this first installment, things become slightly calmer and easier to follow with the descent into Jaburo and the ensuing battle in the skies above, but that's pretty much the only redeeming part.

Those familiar with the series might get something out of seeing the revamped animation and the way some scenes play out differently, but fans who've yet to see it would do well to steer clear.",1436486400,2,840,4.573333333333333

2384143,1,B000AARKEO,"First off, I will say that I love this series, but it is not a review of the show but rather for the product and trying to bring awareness of the product's availability and bootleg problems plaguing the marketplace. This is not a seller problem, but these will be found at conventions, online retailers, and brick and mortar stores that don't know better.

In 2012 Bandai Entertainment USA went out of business. Since then many bootlegs have hit the market, especially for the popular shows.

These bootlegs typically come in a clear case and are nearly indistinguishable between the retail copy. These bootlegs are using the same disc count, disc art, and are copying the DVD sleeves art and information as you would see with the official retail release  1:1. This particular series was never released with clear casing and came in a thick black box. The DVDs they're using for these are DVD-5's, meaning that the max they can put on the disc is about 4.75 Gigs while the official retail releases use DVD-9's. Due to the fact it's impossible to tell by looking at the DVD set, the only way to know for sure if you have a bootleg or retail copy is to check the disc's properties in your computer.

The only way you will know for sure that you got an official retail copy, will be:
1. If you buy *directly* from Amazon or Rightstuf. Their warehouse stock comes directly from the publisher.
2. If you buy new it will come with a security sticker.
3. The final test to see if it is legit is to put it into your computer and see if the disc is less than or greater than 4.75 Gigs. If it's greater than that, then you should be good.
Example: [...]
(note: the bootleg on the right was not an Anime Legends bootleg, so they may have copied the disc file name for these as well)

I hope you found this information useful. There's not many people who know about this and I'd hate for people to continue falling prey to buying bootlegs.

Not only is this happening to Bandai's Anime Legends sets, but it's also happening to Discotek Media's sets as well.

2384149,5,B000AARKEO,"Since it never got a TV release stateside, many anime fans have never watched the sequel to Yoshiyuki Tomino's original space opera Mobile Suit Gundam, which now regarded as a milestone in anime and count among one of the most universally beloved Sci-fi epics. Much like Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam uses space as a backdrop for a compelling, character driven drama and fantastic galactic battles between rivals factions. While the main character, Kamille Bidan, is annoying at first - a sort of proto-Shinji Ikari from Evangelion - his evolution from the immature, reluctant pilot to warrior by series' end is a brilliant telling of any teenager's maturation into adulthood. One strike against the series, a 50-episode arc in the Universal Century saga, is how slow the first half of the series progresses, seemingly caught up in introductions to characters and plots.

This series is a follow up to the original mobile suit gundam, and keeps in line with it well. Character development is great.

2384154,3,B000AARKEO,"I bought this DVD set thinking that this was some great gundam series that never had its chance in America. I grew up on gundam from toonami like a lot of other people, and enjoy all the timelines from Mobile Suit Gundam to Gundam Wing.

That being said, I did read all the reviews and realized that it was mostly a competition between which timeline is best. I honestly don't care, and bought this just because I enjoy watching the anime. So it's time to actually write a review and not an opinion on which series is better.

The DVD set does not have extras, nor does it have anything other than decent looking graphics on the disc. The audio it OK, but can get old if you focus on the fact that some of the characters voices are not the same as in the original series. (this being a follow up to Mobile Suit Gundam)

The video quality is good considering the time that this anime was made, but it's not going to be like the cover of the DVD set.

The story could be great, but the main character is annoying. This gets in the way of the character development, and the plot.

I would consider getting the second DVD set, but probably won't since I did not like watching the first set. While watching the season, I kept waiting for it to get good. I've finished watching it, and I'm still waiting.

To be honest, I can't see why so many fan regards Zeta Gundam as being the best in the series. I couldn't even finish watching it. I found it to be a complete waste of money. I've heard of many fans putting down other series and praising this one. I'm very disappointed in this series. I found it boring as well as too unbelieveable. Yeah I know it's fiction and all, but still, at least there was more of a scientific basis in SEED. Not someone getting a kick to the forehead and all of a sudden is an almighty newtype. Maybe back in the days this was hot. But I think it either needs modernization or just plainly isn't my cup of tea. I hope Unicorm Gundam is good.

2384160,4,B000AARKEO,"Ahhh, Kidou Senshi Zeta gundam.  Direct and very strange sequel to the original mobile suit gundam.

Overall, the series is pretty good. A few 'meh' things are present but overall pretty stable.

The good news is what gundam fans typically want is here, IN SPADES.  Lots of new designs for mobile suits, gandams, mobile armors and everything else.  It's frankly a huge amount of new stuff for the gundam universe.  Solid mech design, check.

The characters are not exactly easy to sympathize with, but that said, they are realistically flawed and interesting to see work, if awkwardly portrayed sometimes.  The intercharacter relationships are also, fascinating to see played out but again, a little awkward when put to the motions.  ((On side note, just about he whole crew of the white base makes a cameo at some point.))

Even if the series does take itself too seriously sometimes, you, the viewer can just sit back relax and remember 'OMG, did the kid with the girl's name just suckerpunch a dude with and '80's haircut?!'

Oh, a did I mention this was the gundam series that began exploring the human-advanced human relationships that would be the conerstone of Seed and S. Destiny?

The bad: Three words 'nineteen eighties fashion'  Sometimes the hair and clothes made me want to slam my head into a computer a laugh, but hey, I probably shouldn't knock the '80s, I didn't have to survive it.

Like I might have mentioned earlier, sometimes it's hard to really get behind the characters motivation, that sometimes drags things down.

The final word:  With more plot twists over it's 50 episodes than an M. Night movie, more deep human themes than the original and lots, and I mean lot's more giant fighting robots, Zeta gundam does the good work of any mecha series.

Over all, it feels like a first tentative step after the original gundam into somthing bigger.  Something more profound, something... perhaps.... more human than teenagers piloting big metal men.

Regardless of how you slice it, the Zeta complete collection one is the first half a a good, no great, series.  And you can tell Shinn Asuka where he got his angsty disposition from.

And, oh yeah, one final note.  Those who haven't seen the original gundam should at least take a crash course in the events of the one year war.  Zeta is a direct sequel to mobile suit Gundam, so be prepared to hear 'Newtype' and other such terms thrown at you with no explanation.",1215561600,9,2437,4.777511961722488

The animation for Zeta Gundam is just a tweek better than Mobile Suit Gundam, but the new movie of Zeta replaces scenes from the original with modern day graphics that aren't too far off from the style to make them totally out of place.  Worth buying the movie collection...but you'll have to go to another dealer for that.
For all who have seen Mobile Suit and 0083 you'll see a lot of characters who didn't have huge roles the previously mentioned series.  0083 finished with the development of the Titans and now in Zeta you get to see how they themselves resemble the Nazis.
This series was to air on Cartoon Network's ""Toonami"", however the events that transpired on 9/11 cut the airing of Mobile Suit Gundam that was probably more than half way through.  The atmosphere presented in that show is not as grim and dark as Zeta Gundam.  I think that's why so many gundam fans adore this show, because of it's depiction of war that you'll see in Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and Platoon.
I didn't like Gundam Seed because of the plot, recycling of concepts from Mobile Suit Gundam and Zeta, as well as the incredible amount of episodes rehashing what's happened up to the current. No wasted episodes trying to catch up the viewer back from holiday...that's why there's Tivo.",1184112000,3,1536,4.645756457564576
2384163,5,B000AARKEO,"Yes after a very long wait Gundam Z is now in The USA. Z Gundam is probably one of the most important gunadm series in the franchize. This is supposed to follow up on the Original Mobile Suit Gundam Series. It really does too, It mostly stars a new chracter named Kamille that is considered a newtype. Also Luitenant Quattro which is actually Char Aznable if some of you new people get confused. I highly reccomend this series instead of Gundam Wing or Seed which I am not sayin is a bad series but is just not important in the Gundam Franchize more like an alternate Universe. Get this series and other ones such as.

2384164,5,B000AARKEO,"gotta be the most epic Gundam series of them all. seriously i've gotta say that if you are a TRUE gundam fan, then you can enjoy the alternate universe shows like Gundam Wing, God Gundam, and Gundam SEED AND love the old school space opera dramas like Gundam, Stardust Memory, War in the Pocket, The 08th, and this series...Zeta Gundam. How can you like Wing and NOT Zeta, or like Zeta and NOT Wing? Yeah they're different but they're both still Gundam. Deal with it and stop complaining.

ANYWAY though, seven years after the glorious end of the original Mobile Suit Gundam, the Federation has become corrupt, as hinted throughout the original series. Because of Zeon Resistance which took place during Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory, the Feds have come up with an elite squadron called the Titans...but the Titans, along with the Federation, become increasingly corrupt. So the Anti Earth Union Group (AEUG) emerges to fight the corruption of the Titans. Composed of former Zeons (like Char), former Federation soldiers (like Amuro, Bright, and Hayato), and colony civilians (like new main character Kamille Bidan), they go in on recon to check up on the Federation's new project--the Gundam Mk. II. After it is stolen by hot-headed Kamille, he joins the AEUG with ""his"" new Gundam and in space AND earth faces numerous trials such as the death of his parents at the hands of the Titans, falling in love with enemy Titans soldier (and Psyco Gundam pilot) Four Murasame, and receiving guidance from fellow Newtypes Char and Amuro, who in an unlikely twist of fate, are now allies. And Kamille gets to experience the full extent of his newtype abilities as he becomes the pilot of the new and improved Zeta Gundam and faces off against the Titans newtype leader Scirroco, while Char has a settle to score with his old newtype flame, Haman. the series closes with a strong, epic two-on-two battle right before it's heartpounding cliffhanger ending.

The UC Gundam series are much more realistic and sorrowful than Wing and SEED but it doesn't mean that by any means those shows are bad. they depict all the war and realism like any other gundam series and are just as excellent. in my mind, Z Gundam probably has to be the best Gundam show in its 25+ year history. although Wing is my favorite (since it was the show that introduced me to gundam in the first place heh). it was introduced in the U.S. in 2004 in the collection pack, and now there are the separate DVD's! Get em. love me! embrace gundam the way the japanese viewers did in 1985. This show's four gundams are intense. the battles are to die for. you'll fall in love with the characters, their relationships, and their mobile suits. Mobile Suit Z Gundam. check it out and fall in love with tha big g all over again! WING. SEED. VICTORY. ZETA. DOUBLE ZETA. X. GOD. TURN A. ORIGINAL.

8077443,4,B000AARKEO,"It's fitting that Zeta Gundam (which revived the Gundam series in it's infancy) should have such an amazing Bluray restoration. I have never been more impressed with a remaster than I have been with RightStuf's Gundam line. There is an English dub (if you're into that sort of thing) and the original audio is remarkably clear. The visuals are crisp and clean, and aside from the aspect ratio and old animating techniques, it looks like a modern Anime.

The only reason a star is missing from this review is that the original opening theme has been replaced. The music they use is fantastic and you'd never know it wasn't originally there, but the whole point of these remasters is to preserve the original experience for the following generations. I understand it was probably just a licensing issue, but I feel like I'm paying top dollar for them to resolve these issues before release.

All-in-all this is a must-own for Gundam fans and it's not a bad starting point to get into the series.

Big thanks to RightStuf, Sunrise, and Bandai Namco for keeping Gundam alive, and making it easy to finally own the whole expansive series!",1526688000,,1133,4.770408163265306

8077445,5,B000AARKEO,"I will be making comparison between the RightStuff (bluray) and anime legends(old dvd set) releases.

First of all video quality:

Anime Legends: i don't know if its because i use a ps4, but the video initialy plays in full screen, but it looks better when you adjust the screen to 4:3.  Other wise the video looks fine either way, but if you do crop the image when its in full screen or 16:9.

RightStuff: intially plays in 4:3 ratio but can be adjusted to full screen by using tv options. Doing this will crop the image so some of the picture will be lost. The colors in this version are much nicer and the picture quality is noticeably better. Plus the subtitles look cleaner.

The obvious winner here is the RightStuff release

Now for sound quality.

Both versions come with the english dub and the original japamese audio. Sadly there is a major difference between both releases; the anime legends release seems to have extremely compressed audio and at times sounds muffled. The RightStuff release on the other hand has remasterd audio and sounds light years better.

On a sad note, the original openings from japan are omitted in both versions for an unkown reason (probably copyright stuff.)

Either way the right stuff release is better.

Random notes!

Both releases are a bit empty when it comes to extras so this won't be a major determining factor. Also, the menus are a bit bland, with only having still images, but the RightStuff release lacks music on the main menu!

Well, my final thoughts are these; even if you have the anime legends version id reccomend you pic this up on blu ray. Picture and audio quality are worth it alone... not to mention the durability of the disc.",1506297600,,1694,4.647651006711409

8077448,5,B000AARKEO,"The first couple episodes of this show always fail to sink their teeth in to me and make me want to watch more. But after those? After those, this quickly gets going and is just so much fun to watch. Having not watched the series in full since getting the DVD release a decade or so ago, this new Blu-Ray presentation is marvelously done with picture and sound quality as good as one can expect. The opening in particular is very nice to look at now, and I actually think the orchestral theme music for this version fits the (often somber) tone of the show very well.

I would recommend watching the Mobile Suit Gundam movie trilogy, or the 43-episode TV version of that same story before watching Zeta Gundam. This isn't something I'd say is a strict requirement but there will be characters and plot lines that feel out of left field if you don't have that backstory for context.

The last thing I'd have to say about it in general would be to note that perhaps the most wonderful part of this show is that all of the characters are various shades of gray. There's no clear-cut, flawless, perfectly moral protagonist, nor is there a complete ne'er-do-well, pure evil, hateful antagonist. There's an element of realism to the message underneath the giant robot lens presenting it.",1501545600,2,1281,4.614035087719298

8077450,5,B000AARKEO,"First I want to start by saying that I have no idea what these other reviews are talking about. NOTHING is omitted! My openings and endings play on every episode just fine. I think they might be using crappy bluray players that have some software on them, that will fast forward past the openings. I'm using Microsoft XBOX One. NO issues. Not sure what they are talking about... But anyways its the english version openings using the changed music. Which is much, much better if you look at the english openings that use the japanese song. Anyways this is an excellent anime. Always worth watching. Much darker than first Gundam. Is it worth the money? YES! I will always be rewatching my gundams, so owning the latest on blu ray is the way to go!",1488153600,,747,4.54074074074074
