1422168,2,B00005BGR2,the tile is excellent ... however  some of the acting was not really good eventuate it was a lot of nudity it seem tat it needs  more work and realism in most  clips it was in a need of more passion and naturalism  close to the reality the only good thing was the host she was in to her role as a host..,1462665600,4,303,3.761904761904762

1422173,1,B00005BGR2,This was a fun gift for a young  newlywed couple and told me it was a waste of my money.  They said acting was just unrealistic and boring to watch.,1451606400,,148,3.9
1422174,2,B00005BGR2,"I agree that Casting Couch has beautiful women all took off their cloth, but they do not show their private part, only (T &A), One girl show it all at the end of the video for couple shots, Also the the video has some sex scenes male -female, and female - female very similar to Cinemax late night movies where you do not see the actual sex or sex parts, beside lots of these girls had fake boobs ( silicon). In addition the camera was far from the actors most of the time, very few close shots, and picture was not that clear. if you are interested in a turn on movie, look somewhere else,",1449792000,11,590,4.139130434782609
1422175,3,B00005BGR2,"Casting Couch doesn't really need a lot of explanation.  What kind of things can you imagine taking place on a casting couch?  Yep, you got it.  Just add a reasonably attractive hostess leading you from one story to the next, and you've got Casting Couch all figured out.  This little film does come from the fine folks at Surrender Cinema, but I'm afraid you won't see any of their real stars putting in an appearance.  Sadly, that means no Jacqueline Lovell or Venesa Taylor.  The girls in these ""auditions"" aren't bad, though, and just for those who would complain about the exploitation of young actresses, even in a fictionalized portrayal such as this, there is one scene wherein a woman does a little exploiting of a man and, of course, another scene featuring a woman casting director trying to make sure an actress is going to be comfortable with the type of scene she is auditioning for.  I'll give this effort three stars, with one point deducted for the lack of any real Surrender Cinema starlets and another point deducted for the fact that I saw a little more than I really wanted to see of the actors (if you know what I mean).",1047859200,11,1142,4.568627450980392
1422176,4,B00005BGR2,"Casting Couch isn't really a movie.  It basically stars Holly Sampson as a casting agent who tells little stories about aspiring actresses who do some naughty things to get into a movie.  The results are some truly steamy and very explicit sex scenes that are among the most erotic I've seen to date (rivaling those in Femalien and Alien Files).  Yeah, the lighting often stinks and the audio is pretty bad, but these scenes work as the uninhibited fantasies they are. The standout scene is probably the one between the Brits, a very graphic scene that almost crosses the line to hardcore (and the raven-haired woman in this scene is extremely hot).  The unbearably pretty Holly Sampson gets a very explicit masturbation scene, coming at the very end, which might be a long wait for her fans, since this movie runs over 2-and-a-half hours!",1041897600,18,839,4.805555555555555
