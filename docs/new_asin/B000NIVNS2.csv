8287300,4,B000NIVNS2,"Well photographed, on location, without the docu-dramas so popular with programs of this sort, this DVD suffers from a certain chauvinism (British) that is irritating:  for instance, including Stubbs, the painter of horses, is incomprehensible to anyone but a Brit, and the snubbing of exceptional French artists, whose contribution to the painting of the 17th through 19th centuries clearly overshadows that of the British Isles.  The repeated references to Napoleon as a despot with a super-sized ego are hammered unceasingly in the program on David, which simply smacks of the traditional British hatred of Napoleon, with their own fear of the toppling of monarchies throughout Europe as a result of the French Revolution.  No Poussin, Ingres, Courbet, or Lorraine but the inclusion of the deadly dull Constable?  At least Reynolds was not included...That the program stops before the Impressionists is O.K., as the latter herald Modern Art, and the ""Great Artists"" included in this survey are essentially Old Masters.

Also, there is a certain ""skipping around"" from century to century, perhaps inevitable in a program that devotes only half an hour to each artist, that results in a certain confusion.  For example, the same assertion is made that ""Pope Leo X wanted to make of Rome the capital of the art world and hence employed Raphael in 1517..."" while an identical or parallel assertion is made that almost a century later, another pope (Clement VIII) also wanted to make Rome the capital of the art world, by patronizing the painter Carravaggio.  One wonders what had happened in the intervening 100 years between the High Renaissance and the Baroque to cause Rome to fall from being the art capital of the world and make it thus on track to ascend once again ca. 1600 (the sack of Rome?  resurgence of Florence or Venice?).",1415923200,,1835,5.052980132450331
8287301,4,B000NIVNS2,Tim Marlow tells a good tale with a lovely anecdotal style.  Love the location filming providing a good impression of the places where these works of art were created.  This is a great series for history of art students and enthusiasts alike - nothing too taxing but plenty of wonderful detail.,1245801600,8,294,4.745098039215686
