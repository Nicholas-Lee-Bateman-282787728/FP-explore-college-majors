1362275,4,B00004W5WT,"Tae-Bo LIVE seems to have been designed mostly for experiencedTae-Bo enthusiasts rather than beginners, because it's a bit morechallenging that the Original version.  The basic moves are the same, but many of the new moves require more balance and coordination than anything found on the Original tapes.  For that reason, newcomers may want to try the Original version first.  Others will find some improvements in LIVE, along with a few drawbacks.  The Instructional LIVE tape is far superior to its Original counterpart (it's also almost twice as long).  On it, Billy gives you several helpful safety tips and pointers to make you a better Tae-Boer -- like how to kick over the seat of a chair to keep from overextending your knees. Unfortunately, on the tape I have, the sound fluctuates erratically and continuously, forcing me to constantly adjust it with the TV remote.  Then, we move from the slow and careful Instructional tape, to the fast and furious Basic tape.  The Original Basic may have been too easy, but the LIVE Basic is too hard!  Billy throws new moves at you so quickly, that by the time you get in the correct position to execute one move (making sure your knees aren't over your toes), he's on to the next move!  I eventually got used to it after doing it several times, and pausing the VCR a lot, but I still mess up some of the steps.  Another frustrating sound problem: at the end of my Basic tape, the sound drops to a whisper during Billy's closing speech.  Now on to the LIVE Advanced tape, which is especially grueling, mostly due to the agonizing floor work midway through.  Billy Blanks proves one thing here: you don't need to buy any of those gimmicky machines to exercise your abdominal muscles!  Once you get used to doing the LIVE Advanced workout, you'll be ready for almost anything!  I didn't notice any sound problems on this tape, except that some of the music used is extremely irritating -- to MY ears anyway.  I like the fact that Billy includes more warm up and cool down exercises this time (the Original Advanced tape lacks these), and I like how he admits at the end of the tape that it's a tough workout (really! ).  Plus, LIVE's ""double times"" seem a bit more realistic than the ones on the Original tape.  Also included in the set is an 8-Minute Workout tape (I never used this because I don't believe 8 minutes of exercise is long enough to do much good -- just my opinion).  Overall, Tae-Bo LIVE is a pretty good follow-up to Original, but the technical aspects could stand some improvement.  I think LIVE works best if you buy ""Tae-Bo Gold"" (sold separately here at Amazon) and use that tape after the Instructional tape, and then go to the Basic and Advanced tapes.  Also recommended: Billy Blanks' Tae-Bo guidebook entitled, ""The Tae-Bo Way.""",964396800,299,2799,4.673469387755102
1362302,5,B00004W5WT,I have been doing this DVD in excess of 10 years and it has truly helped my overall cardio strength in combination with use of wrist and ankle weights.  I alternate days between this DVD and his Ultimate bootcamp with resistance bands.  The only video portion of LIVE I use is Advanced which runs about 50 minutes.  You will sweat so recommend you get a 3 x 6.5 excercise mat to protect both your floor and body.,1388966400,,412,4.324675324675325
1362303,5,B00004W5WT,"There is nothing like the original TaeBo Live! I had the original on VHS and was excited to find it in DVD form. TaeBo is my go to at home workout that gives me the reaults I'm looking for. I love this series and have noticed a great change in my body.

I also love the fact that I was able to purchase  this series for under $5!!!! What an awesome deal.",1388620800,,354,3.9027777777777777
1362304,5,B00004W5WT,"I bought this forever ago but never rated it. If you can get your hands on this series and have the drive to work out at home, I think it's a much better buy than CrossFit membership. Not knocking CrossFit, I find I can workout at home better than with a group, gaggle and/or crowd.",1376697600,,282,4.1454545454545455
1362305,2,B00004W5WT,I was really excited to get this TaeBo Live workout dvd because I had it in the past and really loved it.  I just finally got to do the workout with my new dvd and was very disappointed that all the original music is not on this dvd.  It is a weird instrumental the whole way through.,1373328000,,284,3.9649122807017543
1362306,5,B00004W5WT,I did TaeBo in the past without the instruction.  This DVD provides the instruction portion and I found out that I was not getting the full impact in the past by some moves I was not doing.  I recommend this powerful DVD to anyone because it contains all levels of effective workouts.,1368489600,,284,4.4423076923076925
1362307,1,B00004W5WT,I've been doing tae Bo for 15 years. This DVD is slow and boring. It never gets going. For a beginner it may be a good intro but don't expect results. I recommend tae Bo get ripped advanced. It's old but good. Also the original tae Bo advanced VHS is a classic that still rocks. This DVD is a waste of $$$,1317427200,,305,3.935483870967742
1362308,4,B00004W5WT,"I just had to replace my old Tae Bo live because I had it so long that it just quit working.  I bought the original Tae Bo Live probably in 2002.  Recently I have started trying to lose weight and tried using this DVD and it wasn't working so I was ecstatic to find it here at Amazon for $2.99!!!  I just got it in the mail today, it only took about 3 days for me to get it, and it is the same workout except the music has changed and not for the better.  The music on the other DVD was this pumped up R&B type music that really helped me get through some of the harder parts of the workout.  The beat was great and I really appreciated Billy putting a soundtrack with his workout that appealed to a more diverse audience.  Unfortunately this DVD has the same old lame workout music as just about any other workout video has and I am truly disappointed about that.  But as I mentioned earlier the workout itself is exactly the same and I am grateful to have found this DVD as it is one of my favorites.  If you are new to Tae Bo I would definitely do the instructional portion first.  Also if you know how to work your DVD player you can always skip through the advertisements and go straight to the menu as well as skipping through the beginning advertisements of the actual workout. Tae Bo is something you have to build up to and that you have to do correctly so don't pay attention to reviews that claim you'll hurt yourself.  Those that get hurt aren't following instructions or modifying the exercises to accommodate their fitness level.  I love doing Tae Bo because not only do you burn a lot of calories you are also building muscle and when you get done you truly feel accomplished.

If you want a truly challenging workout you should get this.  It has 4 separate workouts on it, the instructional part, a basic workout (35 mins), an advanced workout (55 mins cardio and floor toning) and an 8 min workout which is more like 15 minutes including the warmup. I gave this a 4 out of 5 because of the same lame old music but for those that like that kind of music you'll think its a 5.",1291075200,2,2091,4.223618090452261
1362309,5,B00004W5WT,"I have benn doing Tae Bo for about 4 years ago,I started after going through learing to be a female boxer which my Father taught me when I was a little girl. My father was me teacher,my coach,and my mentor but it all ended when I lost him to prostate cancer almost two years ago now. When that happened I thought I would of never got back on track to being a boxer,an athlete,a artist whatever you want to call it but after I lost him I gave up because he was gone and I lost the passion for my mourning period of my recovery. But after a few months went past I started thinking and remembering the memory of my father and what he had taught me and told me never to give up,him being one of the biggest athletes in America,my father could play and participate in any sport and I was the child who took after him,being a athlete and of course one of the biggest tomboys on probably the face of the earth,which my father never cared about or the rest of my family for that matter,but my father always loved the fact that a took after him as a boxer and a athlete. Tae Bo was one of the workout videos that got me back on track after going through my heart breaking ordeal. This Tae Bo live video collection on DVD is a great set of workouts. I especially love Tae Bo advanced workouts that really pump up the rush and healthy feeling of the sweating enjoyment of exercise. I love doing these Tae Bo live workouts along with the other workout videos that are hard core and are great to go with my training as a boxer,an athlete,and an artist which tae bo,boxing,and other exercise for training to be an athltete is a complete art form in itself. Trust me you will love these Tae bo live workouts and as you do them you will start to feel strong and powerful and I am saying it to both you men and women. Billy Blanks is a wonderful,hard core but sweet and filled with motivation as an instructor. There are the basic 30 minute workouts and my favorite advanced 60 minute workouts. To me tae bo never gets boring,I am addicted to it and it is intense with also being very easy to follow. I think Tae Bo is on my list of the best video workouts ever made,it is great for both men and women,and these tae bo live workouts available on DVD will make you feel powerful and give you great results of weight loss,being fit and feeling strong and of course make you feel great.",1287792000,,2366,4.213656387665198
1362310,4,B00004W5WT,"I have been doing TaeBo since it first came out in the '90s. Even though it has not been consistent, I find that TaeBo (kickboxing) seems to be the only exercise program that subtracts the inches/pounds for me.  I used the TaeBo original basic before my wedding and used the Get Ripped Advanced 1 & 2 about 5 years ago to lose my pregnancy weight- I was ripped or nearly so! Now fast forward a number of years & I find myself a bit heavier than I would like. What's funny is that I suffer from a case of ""video snobbery"" where I think everything else is better than TaeBo.  Well, I'm back on the Billy Blanks kick and those inches are melting away for me- again!

I recently purchased this TaeBo Live series and did the advanced workout.  It's a great compliment to the Get Ripped Advanced dvd but it does not come close to the intensity of the GR Adv dvd.  I gave this dvd series a 4 because it's good, old-fashioned TaeBo, with the calisthenics (toning exercises) thrown in, for a good sweat.  I'll be rotating this dvd, along with the GR Adv & the Ultimate Upper & Lower Body.  These are top notch TaeBo workouts!",1281484800,,1116,4.311004784688995
1362311,4,B00004W5WT,I love Taebo. It's a great work out. There is a lot of great stuff and it's challenging. I recommend it.,1268956800,,104,4.0
1362331,5,B00004W5WT,"I really like this DVD.  It's really nice to have the four different versions all on one.  The advanced segment Kicks My Butt, I love it!!!",1251504000,,139,4.3076923076923075
1362332,5,B00004W5WT,"This DVD is awesome because it takes the VCR set that costs like $75 or more and condenses to one DVD and is cheap!  This is one of the original workouts.  There is the instructional, basic, advanced and 8-minute workouts.  I love this DVD.",1242950400,,240,4.409090909090909
1362333,5,B00004W5WT,"After having purchased the Original Tae-Bo VHS series from the late 90s, I decided to try the Tae-Bo Live VHS series, and I have not been disappointed!  I skipped right over the Instructional and went straight into doing the Basic workout.  The Basic Live workout is far better than the original and TO ME, it's a very good, solid, FUN workout.  The music is better (at least to me), and Billy mixes up the moves quite a bit.  Those speed bag routines are MOIDER on my arms but highly effective in getting results!

I believe I did the Advanced workout ONCE, and have not attempted it again.  It's certainly somewhat more challenging than the Original Basic workout.

I'm a Tae-Bo enthusiast, so I like almost everything Billy Blanks puts out.  I also work out using Walk Away The Pounds 1, 2 and 3 mile DVD set to vary my workouts on a day-to-day basis.

At any rate, Tae-Bo Live is a keeper!",1238716800,,893,4.462962962962963
1362334,5,B00004W5WT,"I LOVE the Advanced workout.  It is a great overall body workout.  Just when your out of breath and ready to quit Billy slows it down for you.  It was just what I was looking for to get back in shape.

The Basic is great for beginners.  I did it for two weeks and moved on to the Advanced.

The Instructional should be watch for first timers.  Billy shows you the correct form to put less stress on elbows, shoulder, knees, etc.  Having bad knees I know you need to do it correct or you won't be walking the next day.

I would recommend combing this workout with others, so you don't get tried of doing the same thing and keep challenging your body.  I also do the Rock N Sculpt series (which help you target abs and buns).",1215561600,,723,4.136690647482014
1362335,5,B00004W5WT,Awesome and a must in your work out program. My husband and I enjoy doing it together. It is something we can both do and feel good about it.,1192924800,,141,3.896551724137931
1362336,3,B00004W5WT,"After years of being an active gym goer, on and off over the years, I bought this video after retiring from the gym scene due to my increasingly hectic work and school schedule.  After not working out for almost a year, I decided to start working out at home in the morning. One, I can't go more than a few months without going stir crazy if I don't get exercise. Two, I consider myself to be pretty active and needed to boost my endurance and energy for all that I have to accomplish in a 7 day-week.

I had heard a lot about Tae Bo and had previously done kickboxing workouts at the gym.  What a degree of difference.  This video did not offer the cardio I was used to.  It was very sedentary in fact, especially the advanced portion, which focused a lot on upper body (arms & shoulders).  I barely even broke a sweat(being the cardio lover that I am). To look at Billy and the rest of the crew, they seem to be dripping by the end of the video.  I will say that this was probably the best workout for getting back into an exercise routine, after being inactive for so long.

For those who have couch potatoed their way into a few extra pounds, this is a great starter workout. After a month, you may be ready for something a little more invigorating (cardio!).  I did find that his conditioning was very effective (being that I loathed conditioning and strength training).  The ab, thighs, and glut workout was hard for me and definitely did the job.  This is the only reason I continue to use this video. Not so much for the cardio (which is minimal) but for the toning and conditioning.  The kicks as well are very good for building range of motion, which I had lost in the near year of not working out.

After a month of this video, I'm ready for something a little more challenging.  I will give this video credit for definetly waking me up in the morning. I'm not a morning person and the little blonde woman that does all the counting, is loud enough to scare you into full alert. If she doesn't get you going then nothing will.",1171929600,,2037,4.298429319371728
1362337,1,B00004W5WT,"Too many commercials.  I have no idea when the actual TaeBo instruction starts.  AFter minutes and minutes of commercials, I gave up and shredded the dvd.",1162684800,,154,4.884615384615385
1362338,4,B00004W5WT,"This is a tough, sweaty workout, and a lot of fun.  However, the enthusiasm that made the originals so motivating and engaging seems to have disappeared.  Blanks is still his outgoing self, but his disciples aren't near as energetic as those from the original vhs set.  Nobody answers with screams or counts except for that poor girl with the perm and the awesome abs, so she comes off as annoying because she's the only one getting into it.  If I were the director, I would have ordered a reshoot and given them all some RedBull.  Also, I think the workout was a bit easier, probably as a result of the complaints of health professionals that some of his original workouts were not so good on the joints (if people didn't warm up or follow the instructional video properly).  All in all, it was a fun variation, but I'm going to find a vhs player so that I can do the old tapes.",1156464000,3,879,4.395061728395062
1362339,5,B00004W5WT,"I originally purchased the Tae Bo Live series on VHS several years ago, and I loved it so much that I wore the tapes out, and thus I began my search for the equivalent series on DVD.

I am pleased that all four of the workouts from the Tae Bo Live series were put onto a single DVD, instead of each individual workout being put onto individual DVDs a-la the Capture The Power series.

Now, there has been complaints about this DVD edition regarding large amounts of advertising towards the beginning of the DVD that is impossible to skip.  I was wary of this the first time I put the DVD in my player, but was surprised that while I could not skip the advertising using the forward chapter button, I was able to skip is using the button that takes you directly to the menu - this is what I use to skip beginning animations in my Lemony Snicket DVD, my Chocolat DVD, and various other movie DVDs that I own, so I don't find this to be a problem. I'm not sure whether this is due to my player being multi-zonal or that I'm in New Zealand and there are manufacturing differences between the majority of Amazon consumers, but I certainly don't find myself grumbling about being forced to watch advertising.  Even if I were to not be able to skip it, I would march in place while the advertising was on so that I would be a bit warm when the workout actually began.

The quality of the DVD edition compared to the VHS edition is fantastic, though one thing that surprised me is that the music is different.  I'm not too bothered by it, I just didn't expect anything to change after re-releasing the series on DVD.

Here is what you get:
1. Instructional Workout - 52 minutes of introduction to proper form using the Tae Bo technique.

2. Basic Workout - 34 minutes of kickboxing cardio.  If you want to get some toning in, I recommend that you rotate this workout with another toning workout, eg: ""I want that body"" by Tamilee Webb or ""Lift weights to lose weight"" by Kathy Smith (or even ""Shrink your Female Fat Zones"" by Denise Austin, for females only!)

3. Advanced Workout - 55 minutes of kickboxing cardio with ab and lower body toning thrown in.  This is a more well rounded workout than the basic workout, and if you're looking for a no-nonsense, all angles-all areas covered, this is it.

4. 8-minute Workout - The workout in its entirity is more like 15 minutes long, due to Billy's warmup and cool down.  I do this during the week before I go to University, and is fantastic for time-pressed people.  I don't think you should attempt this thinking it is easy though - make sure that you can do the Basic workout first; the length of this workout might mislead you!

I can't compare this to the original series, since I haven't tried it, but I do know that on its own, Tae Bo Live is intense, hardcore, and a whole lot of fun!

1362340,5,B00004W5WT,"I've been working out for over 4 years to many different types of exercise (ex. yoga, high/low impact cardio, dance, Pilates, etc.) and I believe nothing even comes close to how effective, fun, and challenging Tae-bo can be.

""Tae-bo Live"" is a 4-pack video workout library released by Billy Blanks, creator of Tae-bo. The DVD contains the Instructional, Basic, 8-minute workout, and Advanced, with a total of 167 minutes.

* The Instructional is the first workout you should do before doing any of the other Tae-bo workouts. Billy takes you through all the moves with modifications and what you should look for when doing the moves. It's just like being in a Tae-bo Instructor's class. 52 minutes.

* The Basic is perfect for any level of fitness - if you are new to Tae-bo, it'll give you a good look at what the ""Tae-bo Burn"" is all about. If you are advanced, it's a good workout to do on lighter days. Most of it is cardio - if you want to tone up, you might want to add another workout video to this one. 34 minutes.

* The 8-minute workout is perfect for those short of time, but, contary to the title, the workout is actually 16 minutes long! Billy starts the workout rather quickly; you basically jump right into the cardio part of the workout, which can strain and injure the body, if not warmed up properly. It's perfect, though, for those who have conquered the Basic and need more stimulation. I recommend you do the Basic and the 8-minute workouts together until you are confident enough to do the Advanced.

* The Advanced is like the Basic (longer of course - at a total of 50 minutes compared to 34 minutes), with TERRIFIC toning for the abs and lower body. The combos in this workout are amazing - they are a little more challenging than the ones in the Basic, but they are pretty easy to follow. When doing the Advanced, you don't need any other video to complete your workout - the toning is included (ab work is 10 minutes and lower body work is about 10 minutes too), as well as a complete warm-up and cool down.

One of the negatives in the Advanced workout is Billy's assistant (and daughter) Shellie's behavior. Near the end of the workout, she seems frustrated, annoyed, and tired, saying things like ""Come on, guys, you aren't kicking hard enough! Harder!!"". Bad day, Shellie?

She can also be annoying. In the Basic, she probably has said ""Yeahhhhhh"" and ""Whoaaaaa"" more times than I can count. It can be annoying, but hey, those are just minor details.

Overall, this workout is fantastic. I totally recommend this DVD - you'll be stimulated enought with this DVD for a long time before you feel the need for another workout video.",1123718400,3,2660,4.573529411764706
1362341,4,B00004W5WT,"Tab-Bo Live is a new challenging way to work out. This series comes with instructional, basic, advanced, and 8 minute workouts. Fans of the original workout will love this series. The moves you complete in this series are basically the same from the left with roundhouse kicks, punching and other combos using your legs. In this series though, it is more complex like more combinations with arms and legs while doing the workout. For example you have to do a leg lift to the right and punch combinations. This tae bo really goes fast even for the basic workout, but it has been a great way to move your body and lose some weight since you will sweat a lot. I can't believe how much the people behind him were sweating just for the instructional video. It may be confusing to get the moves down the first time because he goes fast. I have enjoyed this series.

The con to this series is the woman with perm blonde hair on the right side of the tv screen. She is in every workout and as annoying as can be. Billy blanks must be getting lazy because he needs her to do the 8 counts while working out. Plus, she will scream and shout every once in a while which is annoying. I liked the original 1st Tae Bo better since I liked the soundtrack better and the moves were more to a much even pase for what workout you were doing.

Even though this series is good, the original is much better. This series is more for advanced people who have done all the other Tae Bo series. If you're new to the series start off with the 1st series.",1123545600,2,1527,4.280276816608996
1362342,4,B00004W5WT,"ok, ditto on other comments here (off counts, annoying assitant...).  I'll just emphasize that these workouts are high-impact & require lots of endurance!  If you're not comfortable running & jumping, you might want to pass.  I bought this set last year-- I had 50 lbs to lose, and I thought I could handle some kicks & punches.  However, I quickly noticed that the people in the class have ZERO weight to lose-- they're trim and muscular.  And with 50 extra pounds on me, I really felt the ""high impact.""  So, I put the tapes away and started with a more sensible workout routine (treadmill, some elliptical...), then went back to the tapes-- definitely much easier, but still intensely challenging.  Build yourself up slowly, and REALLY don't expect to get through the basic on your first go-- even the class is absolutely FALLING APART by the end of that workout (I suspect Blanks just got away from himself & went into hyper-drive...).  You'll burn lots of calories, and see results quickly if you stick to your routine.  What's also nice is that there's no outside equipment required, and the tapes are pretty easy to do in small spaces, if you're in an apartment or something...",1120176000,5,1184,4.764705882352941
1362343,4,B00004W5WT,"I'm still working on mastering the Basic workout (yes, it IS indeed challenging!), so I can't comment too much on the advanced.  I will say that, while Billy does mis-count his moves, it's not really a problem once you've used the tape often enough.  I was ""rewinding"" a lot the first few times i used the Basic tape, but after about a week, I know where to anticipate move shifts and off counts.  And as to Shelly (Shelby?  I don't know-- that wicked buff assistant w/the headphones), yes, she is loud and annoying.  At one point towards the end of the Basic workout she yells out to the others in a really angry voice-- ""COME ON, GUYS-- COUNT IT OUT!!!!""; mind you, this is after 26 or 27 minutes of a really (REALLY) intense workout.  If I'd have been in the studio during that taping, I'd've hurt her.  The music isn't so bad-- it helps with keeping the rhythm of the moves.  I'd recommend this set-- the instructional is good, the basic is definitely challenging (esp. the last 6 or 7 minutes-- kicks, then squat-kicks, then more kicks, all @ a very fast pace).  Just be prepared to ""rewind"" a lot and take breaks when you need them.",1119398400,3,1138,4.4326923076923075
1362344,2,B00004W5WT,"Tae Bo is an excellent way to get fit and Billy Blanks is a master motivator, but skip this one.  Billy often times seems like he's making it up as he goes and loses track of his count and excercizes.  Moreover, the constant yelling of his assitant with the headset gets very annoying.",1088640000,9,285,4.3584905660377355
1362345,5,B00004W5WT,"I own the Basic and 8-Minute workout videos from the original Tae Bo Live VHS set.  I started with the 8-Minute tape, thinking that the shorter length would make it easier, but that is NOT the case!  Instructor Billy Blanks jumps right into this workout with a very short (2 1/2 minutes) and fast-moving warmup; he moves much more quickly than his usual warmup pace here.  As the title suggests, the main part of the workout is about 8 minutes long.  Billy covers only a few types of punches (jabs and uppercuts) and includes only one kick sequence at the very end.  However, there are a lot of standing moves to target the abdominal area, such as knee lifts and heel touches.  Billy then leads you through about 2 minutes of static holds for more core work as well as balance, and the workout ends with approximately 1 1/2 minutes of Tai Chi type cooldown moves.  Thus the entire workout lasts about 14 minutes.
The Basic workout is the toughest basic Tae Bo I've encountered so far, but it is also the most interesting, as Billy includes a greater variety of punches and kicks as well as more punch-kick combinations.  This workout begins with a 4-minute warmup and then moves right into punches, placing an emphasis on your waist during the moves.  At one point, there is a particularly tough arms segment requiring you to hold up your arms for what seems like forever--my shoulders were screaming!  The legwork is also challenging, as you will perform several different types of kicks--including front kicks, side kicks, back kicks, and roundhouse kicks--in several different combinations.  Although a few of the combinations were a bit hard to follow, I really enjoyed the variations that Billy included in this workout.  This workout also contains some static holds (about 1 minute), and it ends with an extremely quick 1-minute stretch; the entire program clocks in at 31 minutes.

1362347,3,B00004W5WT,The major drawback of this DVD is that before the advanced work out there are many advertisments you have to sit through before the video begins. This is extremly annoying and makes me mad everytime I do the workout. I have only done the advanced workout and it is not as intense as his other advanced work outs. One positive thing about it is it has a really good ab workout. I would not have purchased this video if I had tried it first.,1065657600,5,439,4.238095238095238

The set has the instructional, which i have never cared to watch.
The basic, which is a 30min workout, it seems to be more challenging than the advanced. The advanced has 20mins of cardio, then 20mins of abs and buns on the floor and then about 8 or so minutes of kicks of all sorts, then a cool down, but the basic just keeps going and going after 20mins and your heart rate has gone up with a great 10mins of lower body with back kicks, and front kicks and side kicks and all that.
The 8min workout, its really like 15mins of an advanced workout.
One bad thing, Billy just can't keep count of the repetitions in these Live tapes, it is annoying! despite that, workouts are great.",1037232000,5,785,4.275167785234899
1362351,4,B00004W5WT,"I was an avid aerobics person for a few years before I started with the first Tae-Bo tapes. This set of tapes I think are much more intense. I do the basic workout probably 3 times a week. It's a great way to get motivated before work.
The Advanced workout is not for the beginner by any means. You really have to want it.
What REALLY annoys me with the advanced workout is Billy's counter-part who is constantly yelling ""Come on you guys"", ""WHEW!"", ""All Right!"", and a number of other phrases meant to keep the motivation going. Which is all fine and dandy, but this is so over-done that it makes you want to turn the volume off. And that's only in the first 10 minutes of the workout.
My recommendation: leave the talking to Billy and just count.
But please don't get me wrong: this is a great set of work out tapes. It just requires patience....",1000684800,15,848,4.339622641509434

This DVD set is so much more affordable than the gyms in my area, and the workouts really do work the different muscle groups in a way that is very do-able.  I think Billy Blanks comes across as a REAL instructor... not just a video head man.  It's nice to see his interaction with his daughter Shelley as well, even their simple glances.  These two are a team!
In three months, I have lost 22 lbs and gotten my stomach back from the c-section delivery I experienced almost a year ago.  Thank you, Billy and Shelley!",1000252800,9,645,4.254098360655738

The negative things about this DVD are:
  1.) Billy has dificulty with counting, so usually one side (the side that starts) has always less repetitions that the other side.
  2.) There are a bunch ... in this workout who can't perform the excersises correctly, so don't watch them or you will also do the excersises incorrect.
  3.) You will get annoyed with most of the people in this workout after seeing it over and over.
  4.) You can't skip the into of the DVD, so every day you have to watch these copyright messages.
  5.) Every section starts with useless stuff, and therefore you have to skip all the first two chapters.",992131200,17,813,4.395973154362416
1362354,4,B00004W5WT,"Overall, very good so far. Most people coud do this, though maybe not with the speed or grace of the instructor. My wife and I haven't had any trouble getting up the will power to do this regularly because it is fun and Mr. Blanks is interesting to watch and listen to. The heavy focus on safety is good too.
As far as why it didn't get five stars, it really is too much in places. The basic workout starts where most would call advanced. Related to this, the stretching and warm-up that should is done at the same up-tempo pace... It feels more like the workout has started without a warm-up session. Also, the instructor doesn't always balance the left and right sides... He will either do one side longer than the other, do a slightly different exercize, or forget entirely to come back to one side after doing the other.
That said, if one works around these issues by ignoring the instructor's pace when it gets too much, and doing the same exercize on the right as the left even when the instructor is doing something else, this can be a really good and fun workout.",990662400,15,1071,4.414141414141414
1362355,5,B00004W5WT,"I am 60 years old and was looking for a supplement for other exercises that I do. Over a year ago, I bought the Original and after finally managing to get through the Advanced tape, I bought the Tae-Bo Live. This is much better, although, like some reviewers, I thought the music is really not the best.(I have gotten to the point where I turn the sound down and turn on a fast paced radio station). The people behind Billy are for the most part regular ""folk"", but there are a couple of Instructors in there, so don't think you have to keep up with them or you are a failure. I would suggest that you do some stretching on your own, prior to getting into the Live tapes---especially the Live Advanced. There is limited time, I realize, but you really need to be warmed up prior to attempting some of the moves (kicking to be exact)---maybe it is just my age, but I still groan when I am about 3/4 of the way through. If finally, you can make it through the Live Advanced, you are in much better shape than you realize. It would be helpful if you go back to the Instructional tape from time to time, since the workout tapes are so fast paced, you want to make sure you are ""doing it right"".",987638400,30,1190,4.223684210526316
1362356,4,B00004W5WT,"I bought this tape set after using the ""old"" Tae-Bo tapes for about a year. Since starting Tae-Bo, I've lost over 40 lbs and have a lot more energy.

The Beginner Tape explains all the moves - I highly recommend watching this first.

The Basic Tape is a great 30 minute workout, however there are a couple of minor goof ups: Billy seems to have trouble keeping the exercise counts consistent on each ""side"" when you're working out. In one spot, Billy starts a new movement before the complete 8-count from the previous move is completed (and his workout buddies in the background get confused). There is another point in the video where Billy tells you to work the ""other side"" but he promptly starts the exercise on the same side already done. And sometimes when switching to the ""other leg"" he doesn't do the exact same exercise after the switch. These problems are all minor, and I've come to anticipate them as I watch. Also, the Tae-Chi style cool-down session on the original Tae-bo tapes is better than the one on this tape. It's almost as if Billy runs out of time, and doesn't want to go over 30 minutes. This tape is ALL cardio. No floor work for legs, buns, or abs.

The Advanced Tape is truly for individuals with a high fitness level. Although I seem to find that the original Advanced Tae-Bo tape gets me breathing and sweating a little harder than this ""Live"" version. Still, this is a killer workout, and not for the timid. I use ankle and wrist weights when doing the Basic Tape, but this one is killer all on its own. The cardio portion is followed by a grueling floor portion for legs, buns, and abs - and you will be watching the clock praying for time to speed up. I keep the VCR display counter on the screen during this tape so I can keep an eye on how long the torture will last!

To be honest, I really don't use the 8-minute tape. I've watched it once, but 8 minutes of cardio, no matter how intense, is simply not enough to maintain a good fitness level. Sure - it's better than nothing, so if you're in a rush then pop this tape in. But you're better off committing to at least 30 minutes a day.

Minor problems aside, this is certainly a workout video worthy to be added to your collection. I suggest getting the original set (where Billy claims he will ""make you a Conquerer!), as well as this ""Live"" set, so that you can keep variety in your training. I find myself using the Beginning and Advanced tapes from both sets on a regular basis.

I've enjoyed these tapes and the positive results!",986515200,,2522,4.401287553648069

It's really great they they give you an instructional tape with the pack, so us beginnners can know what's-what's. I'm also loving the 8 minute tape that this pack includes.

So, I've been using the beginner tape and it is fabulous.  It will be some time before I can build up to the advanced, but I am sure the beginner workout will get me into great shape in the meantime.

1362360,4,B00004W5WT,"Well, our family isn't the most physical, so my parents decided we needed something to keep us in shape.  My dad had heard a lot about tae-bo, and wanted to try it. I had a feeling in the back of my mind that we would watch about 1-2 videos and then forget about it. well, we started with the instructional. It gives many good stretches and teaches you the basic kicks and punches. Ok, not too bad. A little hard, but not too bad. The main problem is getting your directions messed up. I mean come on, this is tae-bo! We paid 50$ for this! The least you could do is not confuse us.....All they had to do was put billy facing forward, and everyone else turned around. But oh well. This just adds to the complexity of the already hard moves. It may seem as if I have just been putting this program down, but trust me, these are just small quips. The complexity actually gives you reason to come back and try it again. Like the title suggests (as does billy himself) you need some commitment. So after punching our way through the instructional video, we decided to preview the ""basic"" work out. uh, yeah, I got tired just watching them, let alone trying to keep up with one of the exercises. After giving the advanced workout an evil look and throwing it in the corner, we popped in the 8 minute one. Now this one I liked. It was intense, yet not too hard to follow. I almost made it through. (It's actually a 10+ minute workout, but don't tell billy that...) Once again these are more minor quips coming from a person that just got the video series today.
Overall- despite my bickerings, I really do believe this is a great workout. I'm going to watch the instructional video a few more times, learn the moves, and hopefully be able to make it through the basic workout alive. I'll keep the advanced workout in the corner for now, thanks. So if you want a workout and are willing to commit, go buy this.
The funniest part of the video(s)?  The fact that you pay 50$ for them and the first 10 minutes are about buying tae-bo gear, including water bottles, pants, punching bags, gloves, arm wraps, and more. Sorry, I'm not that commited.",980640000,14,2134,4.3727959697733

Theses 'tapes' were good enough to infect me with the exercise bug. There is an inclusive quality that is good enough to infect you too. Taebo is great because it fits for such a range of exercisers.

I don't use my VCR much any more so I got this DVD version, it's nice to have my old friend back.  The dvd is pretty much direct conversion of the old 4 tape Taebo Live set onto one DVD. It's a complete exercise program, that includes a beginners tape, intermediate, advanced, and a short version for days when you don't have enough time. Great workout, great value these days.

The not so good part is that this set was produced for videotapes, so the jump to buttons aren't well supported.  ...and he had 'commercials'  inserted into the beginning of the tape which caused me to use the jump to time feature on my DVD for the first time in forever. ...really minor stuff to go though for such a great workout.
