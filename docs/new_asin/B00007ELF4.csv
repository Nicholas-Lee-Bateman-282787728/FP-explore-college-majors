7975512,4,B00007ELF4,This was actualy a good movie. I saw this years ago on VHs at the Video store. Granted the cover art lured me in and as it is pointed out by many---the box art has nothing to do with the movie. All that aside this is a very fun movie and has a rough low budge video feel that seems to work. It has a great plot with an attractive actress who is smart and wants to get out of her impoverished situation  by becoming a cage fighter.woman in a difficult situation combined with survival always works as a good story,1526342400,,512,4.069306930693069

7975514,4,B00007ELF4,"As a person who loves boxing, Bruce Lee & has trained since 1981 I have come to realize that I will always be a student even if I teach an art. There is always something to learn and it would take a thousand lifetimes just to understand the many different styles & rules of fighting. I love this film and have seen it many times. The movie seems to have been filmed with video tape since film gives a warmer picture. The acting is not Shakespearean-but there is a plot and something that the title eludes and misses. The martial arts scenes that are fought are good between the women-but the male fighting is what I really enjoyed. The character named ""Ringo"" who is the clubs male champion is the epitome of a martial artist. In a suite he could sell insurance, he could play a doctor or any number of non violent roles. But, he is fast with his hands, feet and his technique is awesome. I know this is a low budget film but I just kept rewinding the tape to see how the techniques had been performed. I recommend this film as a fleeting glance into some good fighting. Craig Barr.",1272326400,2,1082,4.3088235294117645
