1424459,4,B00005BGS5,"I am sure that Christie's intention with this sauve, quirky and slighty silly couple was to inject more humour than drama into her work and this is captured superbly by this series.

 There are nonetheless, all the beginnings of her razor sharp sleuthing and it was no doubt the slightly cunning intention of the writer, along with perhaps a sign of the then fast changing times; that Tuppence is the brains of the operations.

 Tuppence has sharp and tuned observation skills and a clever knack for unravelling the truth behind the crime, while appearing like the featherheaded flapper and fashion victim with little more on her mind but which lipstick to adorn herself with  or which cloche to pull on.

 Her husband Tommy is pure overgrown public school boy having a ripping wheeze of a time! The couple appeared in Christie's writings before the more heavy weight Poirot and Marple, perhaps she needed to box clever as female writers were rare in her time and it was not so long before her that they pretended to be men to get published, the Bronte Sisters had to after all!

 This series is a witty and light interpretation of the stories and as such pitches it just right. The low budget shows at times but it captures the feel of the twenties in England beautifully, Annis's costumes are pure flapper and the sets are a merry mix of old England and Art Deco.",1110412800,,1365,4.630705394190872
1424460,1,B00005BGS5,"Purchased the ""Tommy & Tuppence: Set 1"" as a gift.  Picture quality was wonderful on all episodes and the sound quality on ""The Secret Adversary"" was likewise.  However, the sound on the shorter episodes was non-existent.  I contacted Acorn Media and they said that the master from the original production was in ""mono"", therefore not of high quality.  Acorn Media suggested I change the television setting from stereo to mono to improve the sound quality.  It didn't.  Only turning the television volume up as high as it can go, are you able to hear any dialog.  However, by doing this, you also hear an irritating ""HISS"" throughout the program, which is nearly as loud as the dialog/music.  Forget it.

I am going to return the DVD and get the VHS, to see if it's any better.

[June 1, 2006]
VHS is much better.  Not a VHS fan, but you gotta go where you gotta go.",1108944000,10,866,4.52258064516129
1424461,4,B00005BGS5,"Christie's second novel, The Secret Adversary (1922), offers the first appearance of Tommy Beresford and Prudence Cowley referred to as Tuppence. By the time we begin the first of their adventures, ""The Affair of the Pink Pearl"", they have married. The Beresfords, playful and quirky, place more easily among Christie's lightly drawn characters. In high contrast to Hercule Poirot or Miss Jane Marple, Tommy and Tuppence offered Christie the opportunity to parody other detectives popular during her time. While she involves them in espionage with the feature film, The Secret Adversary, the one-hour mysteries which follow the rest of the set reflect a brand of humor unique to the Beresfords. We, as viewers, can enjoy their escapades largely because they do not take themselves too seriously.

The episode, ""The House of Lurking Death"" provides the Beresfords with a traditional English country house mystery. Sinister and cold, the estate of Thurnley Grange houses any number of suspects who stand to gain a large fortune upon the death of a young woman.

In ""Finessing the King"", the Beresfords seek out answers to a mystery when Tuppence reads an advertisement in the Daily Leader. The ad takes them to a costume ball and an after party where they stumble upon the murder of a woman dressed as the Queen of Hearts.

The concluding episode to the set, ""The Clergyman's Daughter"", has the Beresfords investigating another mystery at a country estate which may be haunted. Unlike the whodunit, ""The House of Lurking Death"", the ""Clergyman's Daughter"" focuses on a treasure hunt while greedy villains remain nearby with the hopes of collecting for themselves.

Mystery fans in search of something more complex and substantial may enjoy The Secret Adversary but the real charm in viewing these mysteries is in watching the relationship between Tommy and Tuppence, aptly played by Warwick and Annis. Tuppence's use of female intuition as a means of solving mysteries, although appropriate for her time, may seem sexist to viewers but Christie, raised among late Victorians, had adopted similar attitudes when it came to particular gender roles.",1106006400,2,2144,5.205797101449275
1424462,2,B00005BGS5,Tommy and Tuppence are Agatha Christie light.  Good fun and not heavy handed.  But the dvd sound quality on two of the episodes is dreadful.  To hear the actors the volumn must be turned very high and then there is background static.  What a shame to ruin this as the picture quality is better than some Acorn productions.,1099785600,5,322,4.5
1424463,1,B00005BGS5,"This was an email I had to send to AcornMedia, the publishers of the DVD. I noticed that not one review mentioned the awful sound quality? I will followup this review when I check the DVDs at work..but...

Greetings!

I need to complain about the quality of your release of Tommy & Tuppence - Partners in Crime.

I recently rented Volume 1 from set 1 from Netflix, but noticed that on the episode of Affair of the pink Pearl, the volume for the program is very low - very unwatchable, but Secret Adversary for sound was good.

Thinking this might have been a Netflix issue, I recently bought this from an online vendor and noticed the exact same issue.

On Volume Two - the same issue House of Lurking Death -- volume was recorded at a low level, yet the other two episodes were perfect.

Whoever mastered these DVD's did an absolutely terrible job, and I will have no choice but to return my purchase, sadly, I loved this series when i was growing up watching it on PBS - but I cant watch it with the volume issue!

Are there any plans to reissue with the CORRECT audio volume?",1098230400,20,1078,4.36

1424465,4,B00005BGS5,"The stories are wonderful.  The acting is cute and campy in a very good sense.  Unfortunately, the DVD encoding leaves a lot to be desired.  The main problem is that the 2 channel surround shunts all sound to the rear speakers (except for the first episode which is encoded properly).  If you cannot turn off the surround sound on your system, this will become annoying quickly!  It is very much worth purchasing, but be aware of the sound problems.",1069804800,6,449,4.632911392405063
1424466,5,B00005BGS5,"I had never read any books by Agatha Christie, but I was familiar with two of her famous sleuths, Poirot and Miss Marple, mostly through their televised adventures.  But they really didn't appeal to me too much.  Then I discovered Tommy & Tuppence, and I was just in love.  the reason I love this series is because the characters AREN""T Poirot or Miss Marple.  The concept intrigued me, the lighthearted adventures of a husband and wife detective team.  The show is amazing, it's funny, witty, thrilling, and absolutely charming.  Francesca Annis is simply divine as Tuppence, and James Warwick is simply suave as Tommy.  Both have a tendency of hiding their brilliant minds beneath an aura of frivolity and from a sense that maybe they're not entirely sure what they're doing or how to get out of their situation.  The flirtatious wit and charm and chemistry between the main characters is a delight, as is how they employ their skills to unravelling the various mysteries that land on their doorstep.  Highly recommended.",1052092800,6,1023,4.901162790697675
1424467,4,B00005BGS5,"The Tommy and Tuppence mysteries are frothier and lighter than the Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot mysteries, but it's their lightness that makes them unique. They're well translated into film in this delightful threepack of the first five mysteries.
""Secret Adversary"" is the only movie-length episode: Tommy and Tuppence, childhood friends, reunite post WW1 in financially tight circumstances. To drum up some money, they decide to become adventurers. But their lighthearted venture becomes deadly serious when they become enmeshed in an international situation involving a packet of secret documents, a mysterious girl named Jane Finn, an American millionaire and an elusive mastermind called only ""Mr. Brown.""
""Affair of the Pink Pearl"" takes place a while after ""Adversary,"" and is definitelty frothier. Tommy finds the cure for Tuppence's boredom: a detective agency, which they take over and inject new life into. Soon they are called on to retrieve a stolen pink pearl.
""The House of Lurking Death"" is the destination of T&T, when an appealing young woman comes to tell them that someone in her house sent her poisoned chocolates. At first it seems to be a straightforward case -- but nothing is as simple as it seems.
""Finessing the King"" is a little more gruesome than its predecessors. Tuppence drags Tommy to a costume ball and then to the restaurant ""Ace of Spades,"" where they find a woman in a Queen of Hearts costume, stabbed on the floor. All evidence points to her lover, including her dying words, but of course nothing is so simple.
""The Clergyman's Daughter"" comes to T&T with her problems: She thinks that her house may be haunted, by a poltergeist that is scaring off the paying guests she has there. The two travel to the house to find out exactly what the source of the mayhem is.
If you are expecting the same level of complexity as a Poirot/Wimsey/Marple mystery, you will be disappointed. With the exception of ""Adversary,"" these mysteries were all based on short stories, and so they can't afford to be too complex. Nevertheless, they are enormous fun and some of them will definitely keep you guessing. There's plenty of wry comedy in this series, including Tuppence's turn as a weird spiritualist, her array of hats (""there are... NUANCES to them!""), and Albert's obsession with movies. (His dying gangster act is especially funny)
Francesca Annis is enormous fun as Tuppence, with a delightfully flaky charm that covers a brain as brilliant -- if not more brilliant -- than Tommy's. Her 1920s wardrobe is definitely eye-catching; she is also one of the few women I've ever seen who could make Audrey Hepburn look buxom. James Warwick is as noticeable in a quieter way as Tommy, with his cute smile, delightfully confused attitude, and attempts at Sherlock-Holmesian suavity and brilliance. Reece Dinsdale is flawless as Albert, the loyal sidekick with a weakness for Rudolph Valentino movies.
Some of the secondary actors are not quite as good; almost the entire cast of ""House of Lurking Death"" (except the fanatic) is about as expressive as pine boards with painfully civil dialogue, the girl playing Lois overdoes the breathy damsel act, and the Esther actress is hammy, period. The title character of ""Clergyman's Daughter"" also has an annoying habit of starting every sentence with a strained ""oh."" The other supporting actors are very good, though.
This is a delightful collection, and well worth watching.",1020211200,49,3442,5.072310405643739
1424468,5,B00005BGS5,"Good old Acorn Media, who has given us all those Wimsey and Poirot mysteries on tapes and DVDs, is now offering up the first set of <Tommy & Tuppence: Partners in Crime>. Here we have three tapes holding five episodes starring Francesca Annis and James Warwick as the young couple who decides to purchase a defunct detective agency and solve their crimes in the styles of popular fictional sleuths.
The first tape is dedicated to ""The Secret Adversary,"" a full-length tale of espionage rather than crime. This was Agatha Christie's second novel (the first being the first of the Poirots) and was written to get some quick cash for keeping up her family home. Here they meet again after some years apart, fall in love, and become a team for the fun of it. The dcor, as with the other mystery series, is immaculately period (around World War I); and the big feature of this series are the fetching and far-fetched outfits Tuppence dons by way of ""disguise.""
While this team was to last up to 1973 when their last novel appeared, this series emphasizes their youthful adventures and stands in good contrast to the Poirot and Marple sets available from Acorn Media and from A&E. Annis' antics are a delight--although in one episode (not yet released) she is made to look ridiculous--but Warwick turns out to be somewhat of a dull potato by contrast. Perhaps that was intentional. Who can tell?
The stories are light and quite enjoyable. ""The Affair of the Pink Pearl"" is their first official case as professional detectives. ""The House of Lurking Death"" concerns death by poisoning and the question of who the intended victim really is. ""Finessing the King"" centers around a costumed ball with a solution that telegraphs itself far too early; while ""The Clergyman's Daughter"" borrows the idea of a word game from the Holmes tale ""The Musgrave Ritual"" and bears a strong resemblance to ""Gaslight.""
Again, if this series suffers at all, it is only in contrast to the more serious doings in the Wimsey, Poirot and Marple tales. However, on its own merits, ""Partners in Crime"" certainly deserves a top rating.",988848000,34,2101,4.822714681440443
1424469,4,B00005BGS5,"This couple's dialogue does remind viewers of Nick and Nora Charles (The Thin Man series).  In the first movie ""The Secret Adversary,"" we are introduced to a pair of remarkable friends who accidentally become detectives and manage to solve a most baffling and complicated case. The entire cast, including Honor Blackman, is excellent. Tommy and Tuppence seem to be evenly and equally matched as a couple in ""The Secret Adversary"".  In the balance of the remaining movies in this set, however, Tuppence becomes a very modern, emancipated and over-the-top flapper.  Some of her initial niceness and sweetness is permanently lost, and she consistently dominates her husband with highly flamboyant, diva-like, and dramatic behavior.  Her supposed intellectual superiority and financial extravagence are annoying. She behaves as if to the manor born instead of being a clergyman's daughter.  Tommy becomes unbelievably more docile, tolerant and hen-pecked.
The second annoying character in these movies is Albert (or Alfred). When he works at their detective agency, he suddenly has morphed into a very brash, rude, and crazy receptionist/assistant.
All things considered, Set 1 should be seen and owned. England in the 20's and 30's has been wonderfully recreated, complete with authentic costumes and art deco touches.",1247097600,,1315,5.49009900990099
1424470,4,B00005BGS5,"I read The Secret Adversary and the ""Partners In Crime"" anthology of short stories long ago, and they became some of my favorite Christie novels. Fun and lively, not meant to be serious literature. In the short stories, Tommy took on a ""persona"" of a popular detective for each story--Christie was having fun with the detective genre as a whole when she wrote these. I wish the tv adaptation had included more of that quirk (they do a little but quickly drop it). That said, it's a fun watch, well costumed, and I'm happy to add both volumes to my DVD library.",1215129600,,560,4.5
1424471,5,B00005BGS5,I really enjoy these two.  They seem to enjoy themselves.  I do recommend the first CD first.  Really enjoyable.  I like all of Agatha Christie's stories.,1191110400,,154,4.8076923076923075
1424472,4,B00005BGS5,"In 1916, Agatha Christie almost idly mentioned to her older sister that she would like to write a novel.  The sister bet her that she couldn't do it.  The result was Christie's first novel, ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles,"" which introduced Hercule Poirot into the world.  After collecting a handful of rejection slips, the book was published in 1920 and achieved sufficient success (although Christie earned no more than a meager 25 pounds from its first edition) for her publisher to request a second book.

That book, featuring Tommy and Tuppence was published in 1922.  The first book had been a classic mystery, one heavily influenced by the Sherlock Holmes series.  Poirot, himself, might almost be regarded as the Anti-Holmes, while Captain Hastings was very much in the mold of Watson as Poirot's chronicler and, incidently, the complete fool that Watson never was.  The second book, ""The Secret Adversary,"" was a thriller of the E. Phillips Oppenheim variety, although with comic touches.  Christie, being Christie, tossed in some elements of mystery, too.

Prior to the beginning of ""The Secret Adversary,"" handsome and dashing young army officer Tommy Beresford had been wounded in action during the Great War.  He had woken up in hospital to find himself under the care of an absolutely spiffing young woman named Prudence Cowley (who preferred to be called ""Tuppence."")  Shortly after War's end, so presumably in 1919, they meet again, both now in civilian life, unemployed and fast running out of money.  Tommy and Tuppence are true creatures of the 1920s, ""bright young things"" who might have gone partying after an opening night with Noel and Gertie or enjoyed a weekend at Blandings Castle while carrying out a mission for the Drones Club or joined with  Virginia and the rest of the Bloomsbury set in some pointless prank.  In ""The Secret Adversary,"" almost before you can say Bob's your uncle, they're on the British government payroll (sort of) and in hot pursuit of a master criminal.

Now consider Archibald and Agatha Christie.  Agatha had married a handsome and dashing young army captain who had transferred to the Air Force during the war and had come out as a colonel.  During the war, while Archie was away, Agatha had worked in a hospital.  Archie and Agatha were bright young things at the beginning of the 1920s, but not at all well-supplied for money.  Agatha wrote a letter to a friend at about this time in which she moaned about being so short of funds that she and Archie could afford only two servants(!)

I think that Tuppence is a consciously intended self-caricature.  She is the kind of bright and outgoing young woman that the bright but perpetually shy Agatha might have wished herself to be.  Tommy is Archie, but less successful in his military career (because of his wounds, of course) in order to justify his taking up life as an adventurer instead of following Archie's course and disappearing into the stuffy world of Business in the City.

A few years later, Archie proved to be a bounder as far as Agatha was concerned and their marriage collapsed--quite spectacularly, as a matter of fact, but that's another story.  Tommy, however, persisted in Agatha's mind and writings, forever the man that Archie Christie should have been.

Christie never abandoned the Beresfords.  During World War II, the middle-aged pair got involved with counter-intelligence operations and then with more domestic adventures in the post-War era.  Christie's very last and posthumously published novel featured the Beresfords in a mystery.

These dramatizations feature the astonishingly beautiful Francesca Annis as Tuppence and the lightweight but dashing James Warwick as Tommy.  True to their printed sources, there is precious little substance in them but they have practically endless amounts of style (for which the costume department ought to get equal billing with the two stars.)  A running gag throughout the series is that every time the Beresfords journey out of London, there is an enormous pile of leather suitcases lashed down at the back of their car.

""The Secret Adversary"" was shot as a feature-length production, on film and often on location.  As in the book, it is set in 1919 or 1920, as can be seen from the automobiles and even more clearly from Tuppence's many outfits.  The film of the novel clearly served as a pilot for the series that dramatized the short stories.

The series, ""Partners in Crime,"" commences almost immediately after the novel and should therefore be set in 1920.  However, the TV episodes were shifted into the mid-1920s (thus matching the initial publication dates of the stories.)  This change allowed them to take on a crisp Art Deco look and for Annis to wear some truly eye-popping proto-flapper styles.  And hats!  Tuppence's hats start at astonishing and then go wild.  They make Myrna Loy's giddy lids in the Thin Man series look positively conservative by comparison.

The 1980s vintage of these episodes exerts a distinct effect on their appearance.  They preserve the peculiar English television production habit of shooing exteriors on 16mm film, but interiors on videotape.  With the sharp images available from DVDs, the transitions from film to tape and back to film are almost painfully obvious and simply must be accepted as a given.  Also, the fashion of the time was to build interior sets, which seemed adequately convincing at the time but now seem wonderfully stage-bound.

Equally stage-bound are the scripts and performances.  For those accustomed to the more recent  British series featuring Morse or Frost or even Miss Marple, ""Partners in Crime"" will seem highly artificial.  To those accustomed to live performance in a theater, ""Partners in Crime"" will seem bursting with energy and intensity seldom to be found on the screen.

This is a superb set which has the misfortune to be marred by some sound problems.  On viewing a set a couple of years ago, I had complaints about the sound that match those outlined in previous reviews.  On the other hand, another set that I watched recently on different equipment seemed satisfactory enough.

I give ""Partners in Crime"" five well-deserved stars--less one for the necessary buyer beware warning.",1183593600,6,6249,5.036027263875365

Who is Mr. Brown?

After the Great War, out of work Captain, Tommy Beresford (James Warwick) accidentally comes across his lifelong friend and pal Prudence ""Tuppence"" Cowley (Francesca Annis). Tuppence is also out of work. Over their sparse meal they speculate on doing any job of anybody for outrageous fees.

This speculative talk was over heard and the wheels are set in motion when Tuppence is given the opportunity and gives what she thinks is a false name. This sets off a series of events that employs them to find a missing girl and the identity of a mysterious Mr. Brown.

Made for TV and fairly transparent, this film still has all the ambiance of a BBC Agatha Christy production. It is a period piece and employs many major English actors. One actor you can recognize right off is Honor Blackman who played Pussy_Galore in ""Goldfinger"" (1964).

The Affair of the Pink Pearl

After their re-introduction in ""The Secret Adversary"", it looks like Tommy Beresford (James Warwick) and Tuppence (Francesca Annis) are married and after finishing their first case are looking for a little more action. They get the opportunity to purchase the international detective agency and with the help of their new friend Albert (Reece Dinsdale) set up shop.

Death is like a box of chocolates

Agatha Christie's ""The House of Lurking death"" adapted by Jonathan Hales.

Being private and figuring that the anonymous came from someone in that very house, contacts Tommy Beresford (James Warwick) and Tuppence (Francesca Annis) of the international detective agency.

Naturally as with their first two episodes or movies Tommy and Tuppence are both wise beyond their time and do some of the dumbest things that lead them to the solution of the problem. Will they be there in time to save Mary or if not will they be able to figure out who and how it was done. More important why.

The Daily Leader (local new paper.)

""I should go three hearts, twelve tricks, Ace of spades, necessary to finesse the king.""

Of course it is an obvious secret message. However being clever they figure that the message is some sort of rendezvous. It is to take part at the Three Arts Ball (costume ball) where one of the sleuths gets to dress up as Sherlock Homes and the other as Dr. Watson. One guess as to who gets to be homes.

After the ball is over, like most of the revelers, they go to xxx to have a drink an early breakfast. There they notice a man costumed as the local paper entering a private booth with a woman and coming out alone. We are way ahead of them on the plot

7937715,4,B00005BGS5,"Enjoyed the all-too-short series... even though i've never read the Agatha Christie source material... I was warned that the primary character casting might seem incorrect to reading fans, but I fell in love with both of them.  Perhaps not as elaborately staged as some of the British mystery series, an enjoyable evening spent with every episode none-the-less!",1313539200,,361,5.333333333333333
