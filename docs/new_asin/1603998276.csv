3010414,5,1603998276,"In my review on Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, I comment that it is to be bought with this boxed-set, and Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie.  Other fans might add that the other Power Rangers boxed-sets should also be bought alongside this, I'll express why I disagree.  These three items that I have listed are all part of the same story.  Except for Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy, they are continuations of each other, and Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy also makes references to much of it's predecessor season, Power Rangers in Space.

Power Rangers: Zeo is possibly Power Rangers at it's best (or Power Rangers in Space).  Although the original costumes, command center, zords, and villains have become the main icons for Power Rangers, I personally love the costumes, zords, the power chamber (wow, it looks so cool), and the new villains.  The Machine Empire are very entertaining villains, but we get the feeling that they're also very evil.  During the first portion of the show, before we get much storyline, the episodes are absolutely fantastic.  It's great.  We then start to move away from individual episodes to having more storyline in the overall show when Tommy goes on a personal journey, and we find out about his brother.  We then get a bunch of episodes about the mysterious gold ranger, and as soon as we find out who he is, Jason returns and gets the powers.  We then see the Machine Empire changing leaders around, until the final couple of episodes.  Power Rangers: Zeo also includes my favorite Power Rangers Christmas/Holiday special, one that celebrates the many different holiday (although like the others, I don't really care for them as part of the storyline of the overall show).

Power Rangers: Turbo is considered by many fans to be one of the worst.  However, I think it had some fantastic episodes, and even though it wasn't always as epic as previous seasons, it was still very enjoyable.  The show started where they had dinosaur-themed costumes and powers, powered by coins; their villain was a sorceress with a big dress, and she would get a headache whenever she would lose.  The sorceress was replaced by a big being of muscle with a metallic mask, he would glow red whenever he was angry, and they had aspects of their dinosaur-themed powers transformed into mythology-themed powers.  After that, the two villains unite, and get the addition of a giant skeleton, so they now get additional ninja powers and their zords are also ninja-themed.  After that, they get these powers that are a combination high-tech machinery and a magical crystal, and they're up against a machine royal family.  Now, with Turbo, they're up against a whiny woman with her clumsy henchmen, and they have new car-themed powers.  Although the new villain, Divatox, is nowhere near as menacing as the Machine Empire (or even Rita and Zedd), she and her henchmen always entertain the audience.  Their car-themed powers might seem to be a step down from the previous season, but their equipment proves itself to be very useful for these newer situations.  Also, a lot of fans might have complained about the newest member of the team being a twelve-year-old boy, but he actually proves himself to be extremely competent.  I also think it had a great movie to start it out, which isn't included in this boxed set, but you should buy it.  We have some pretty good episodes at the beginning, and then there is a switchover of rangers.  Except for Justin, the kid, all the previous rangers are replaced.  The new team is TJ, Cassie, Carlos, Ashley, and, as already mentioned, Justin.  We don't get major introductions to them before they become rangers although Carlos and Ashley appear in a couple of episodes beforehand.  However, we get to know them well when they become rangers, and there are some pretty good episodes here.  The story-arcs are not my personal favorites, but the individual episodes are mostly great, especially around the end.  Although Turbo is not a favorite amongst fans, I find it to be very enjoyable, and a great set-up to the next season.  It ends with a two-parter called Chase Into Space, where all of the rangers, except for Justin, leave Earth.

Power Rangers in Space is possibly my favorite, and a favorite for many other fans as well.  Zeo is definitely a close second for me, but Power Rangers in Space takes things to a whole new level.  The four rangers that replaced the previous rangers in Turbo join up with a ranger from outer space, named Andros.  They have high-tech (mostly computer-based) powers, and they regularly travel space.  The storyline is large.  Power Rangers: Turbo ends where Zordon (who gave them their powers at the beginning) is captured by the monarch of all evil.  Power Rangers in Space begins where the villains for all of the previous shows are together at a feast.  We are introduced to the new villain, Astronema.  Although she is joined by Elgar, the most clumsy henchman, from the previous season, we get the addition of Ecliptor, possibly one of the most impressive henchmen that we've seen so far.  He's show to be stronger than any of the other henchmen they've been up against, and his relationship with Astronema is much more complex than what we have had so far in Power Rangers.  We are also introduced to Darkonda, possibly the most evil of the villains we've had.  He and Ecliptor also are rivals with each other, and we get something much more complex than heroes vs. villains.  It gets even more complex when we find out that Astronema is Andros' long lost sister, Karone, and Ecliptor even helps her help the rangers.  However, the two of them are brainwashed, and we then get evil power rangers.  There is a fantastic story-arc here about the psycho rangers.  In previous seasons, we've seen evil power rangers, but those rangers were fairly easy to defeat.  The psycho rangers, however, are difficult to defeat.  Another major part of the storyline is their search for Zordon throughout space.  This season ends with a resolution to all of the previous seasons of Power Rangers resolved.  Usually for closing seasons (which this was partially meant to be), they regularly bring back people from all the previous seasons to reflect on the show.  However, I'm, in many ways, glad that they didn't do that.  There was a little bit of that, but mostly not.  This was an amazing season, and it ended the continuous storyline.

Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy is possibly my least favorite of these seasons.  Although many fans look fairly highly on it, it isn't my favorite.  On the other hand, Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy is how I got into Power Rangers, so I definitely can't complain there.  It does have a deeper storyline, and we have villains that are much more complex than typical villains.  I also love how this season takes place on a space station, and is even more in space than Power Rangers in Space.  This was the first Power Rangers season to really have it's own separate storyline, but it does regularly reference back to Power Rangers in Space.  Usually, when I go through watching Power Rangers, I watch this and then I watch the first six seasons.  However, it has some very deep stories, and it was what started the overall formula for Power Rangers.  I really don't have many bad things to say about Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy.  It's a pretty good season.

The special features here are also pretty good.  There's a documentary on Bulk and Skull, which includes a lot of talk about Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (one of the reasons to buy this with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers boxed set).  We get a documentary about the stunt team, and we also get a documentary on the Power Morphicon.  The one on the Power Morphicon is, in some ways, more of a commercial than a documentary, but I'm not complaining.  We also have a few Power Rangers: Zeo previews.  One was a trailer for the gold ranger saga, and the other was a serial of brief thirty-second spots to get people excited for Power Rangers: Zeo.  The serial isn't simply a bunch of basic trailers.  They made special footage to air for this, and if I was watching at the time, I would have definitely been on the edge of my seat.  The two other features are TV specials.  One of them is a funny moments from Power Rangers special, which is decent, but it includes quite a bit of straight up, unaltered, Super Sentai footage (Super Sentai is the show that Power Rangers is taken from).  The other TV special is the original pilot episode for the first season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, edited down a bit, with a couple of original cast members talking about the legacy of Power Rangers (although that was before it had the legacy it has now).  The special features here are fantastic.

Overall, I highly recommend this boxed set.",1413072000,,8787,4.74983498349835

3010419,4,1603998276,"I believe I must be the only one to make this observation, but how could they not include ''Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie'', the 1997 movie that served as the season opener for Power Rangers Turbo? You cannot go from the end of Power Rangers Zeo to the beginning of Power Rangers Turbo if you have not seen the movie, as you will be left completely confused: the movie is absolutely necessary in order to understand the events of Turbo, as one of the rangers leaves, a new one comes in, and the Zeo powers are replaced by the Turbo powers, all important moments in the Power Rangers series.

I can understand why they didn't include ''Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie'' in the Mighty Morphin' box set, as the events of that movie were refilmed for the television series, so that you can just skip the movie, but the Turbo movie is imperative to understand the beginning of Power Rangers Turbo. I suppose this is a rights issue? I can't really think of any other reason why it wouldn't be included....",1409702400,,1007,4.532967032967033

3010429,5,1603998276,"In my review of the first boxed set, I commented on nostalgia can make a show seem better in retrospect than it really was. This is true of Power Rangers just as much as other shows. And the same can be said for this boxed set, containing seasons 4-7 of the long-running show.

As with the first set, Shout! Factory has included all 183 episodes of seasons 4-7, which are subtitled ""Zeo,"" ""Turbo,"" ""In Space,"" and ""Lost Galaxy.""

""Zeo"" follows the Rangers as they gain new powers to fight off an alien invasion mighty enough to make Lord Zedd run away in fear. ""Turbo"" has the Rangers fighting off an evil space pirate named Divatox, and picks up after the second movie (not included in the set, so jumping straight into ""Turbo"" after ""Zeo"" might confuse some younger viewers who have not seen that film; and older viewers may, too, be confused further still by a ""time jump"" after Zeo, where a lot of threads are left unanswered). ""In Space"" sees the team joining up with a new leader, who is searching the galaxy for his lost sister, and ""Lost Galaxy"" sees an entirely new group of Rangers searching for a new world to call home.

As with the last set, the set's quality is superb. The box design is similar to the last, and the disc case artwork is excellent again, but I would have wished for more consistency in artwork between the two sets; place them on a shelf next to one another, and you'll see what I mean.

The show is the primary feature, but the bonuses are a treat as well. ""Tales of the Giant Banana"" is the highlight here, showcasing fan-favorite goons Bulk and Skull. There is also a feature on the stunt men of the show, the fan convention ""PowerMorphicon,"" and even the ""Lost Episode,"" which is one of the three versions of ""Day of the Dumpster,"" the pilot episode. There's more, but giving you a complete lowdown would constitute spoilers. The booklet is again included, with the character bios and episode guides, but still no airdate listings.

Shout! Factory again delivers a top notch set that will please fans of the show, and leave us eagerly anticipating the next set.",1394150400,,2096,4.549071618037135

Power Rangers Zeo:  Admittedly, this was the biggest incentive for my purchase.  This was a DVD dream I've had for so long, it started out as a VHS dream.  In Space & Lost Galaxy had over half a dozen episodes released on VHS & a couple DVDs (Ninja Turtles The Next Mutation Volume 2 & the Best Of).  How many did Zeo get, outside of the first 2 episodes edited together with the Mighty Morphin' series finale into a movie?  It Came From Angel Grove and A Season to Remember; the only 2 episodes I remember seeing as a kid that I didn't like.  As soon as they were over 7 year old me was like ""That's it?  What a waste of an episode.""  Although to be fair, the former wasn't the worst episode of the season as it had a really cool monster of the week in Drill Master; which is more than some of the other duds from here can say (Season is still the worst though).  So anyways, I was desperate for a Zeo fix & got this the day it came out, & it's awesome.  Mighy Morphin' was okay, but didn't get really good until season 3. and this is even better.  As a kid this was my favorite until In Space.  I'm not the only one, there are several people on IMDB who were like ""This show abandoned most of the corny aspects of Power Rangers & became something better.""  For starters I have to admit, this is my favorite Ranger line-up.  Tommy was always my favorite, so it was great seeing him as the Red Ranger.  Adam, Rocky & Tanya are great & I have to admit, Kat is now my favorite Pink Ranger.  When I was younger I was a Tommy/Kimberly shipper, but upon watching some of Mighty Morphin' again, I found her to be my least favorite of the original 5.  So sorry, I'm now a Tommy/Kat shipper.  Oh, and don't forget my favorite of the original 5, Billy.  Poor, poor Billy.  They really should have let him be a Ranger again, but hey he was still a good character.  This season also has my favorite Megazords.  And personally I love the Machine Empire.  These days, I always get annoyed by Rita & her bunch.  Things got better when Lord Zedd came around, and though the episodes after he & Rita married are the best of the Mighty Morphin' era, I still never thought they were very interesting.  But not the Machine Empire.  I always looked forward to seeing King Mondo & his family scheming, & hearing Klank's Scottish accent.  Yes, they did the exact same thing as Rita & Zedd, but to this day I think they did it better, especially in the monster of the week department.  One of the reasons I like the Zeo villains is the same reason I like the ones in VR Troopers; robots are cool & any show with superheroes fighting evil robots every week is okay with me. To this day I think most of the costumes for the villains in both shows look pretty good.  There are a couple of silly ones in Zeo here & there, but unlike Mighty Morphin' these are the exception, not the rule.  It is also possible for episodes to be enjoyable despite the silly looking robots.  As good as the series is it peaks during the second half when the Gold Ranger shows up.  The mystery of who was behind the mask was really engaging.  As I said before, too bad it wasn't Billy.  But at least they brought back my other favorite of the original 5, Jason to become the Gold Ranger for a bit.  I especially liked when they got the Super Zeo Zords, it was so cool seeing the Rangers get Zords capable of handling monsters of the week on their own without having to combine.  And I loved the Super Zeo Megazord's first battle against an enlarged King Mondo.  I was like ""Finally, a high ranking villain comes down and fights the Rangers himself!""  And then Rita & Lord Zedd returned, and in their quest to regain their throne the unthinkable occurred...they became interesting.  They were desperate enough to actually help the Rangers.  It's always fascinating to see villains clash with each other, but personally as long as the Rangers weren't involved I was rooting for the Machine Empire all the way.  This season is still awesome and like I said, it was the best season until In Space.
5 stars.

Turbo: And now we hit the bump in PR's road to greatness.  Zeo didn't just have a promising start; it was a promising start to a better Power Rangers show.  This was at least half a dozen steps back.  Even as a kid I thought this was a step down from Zeo.  The villains aren't that bad.  I'm in the minority but I do like Divatox.  It's her henchmen that annoy me, but I do sometimes laugh at them.  They're still not as bad as Norg from Operation Overdrive.  It was all the changes that did it in for me.  Having a kid as a Ranger wasn't so bad, except for the episodes that focused on him.  The Justin episdoes were way too kiddy for me, even more so than the very first season of the franchise.  Dimitria was a decent replacement for Zordon, but Alpha 6 was much more annoying than his predecessor ever was.  To be honest Alpha 5 could be annoying at times, but he was still a fine character and I find it impossible to hate anyone who shares the same voice as Dagget Doofus Beaver (from Angry Beavers).  Alpha 6 sounds like Rocky Balboa on helium.  And then Tommy and the others left.  That did it for me back as a kid, & I didn't watch it again for a long time until the final 2 episodes aired.  But as I go through these episodes as an adult, I find they did improve a bit.  Apart from Chase Into space, my all-time favorite episodes are The Darkest Day, One Last Hope, The Fall of The Phantom & Clash Of The Megazords.  These episodes feature General Havoc, a villain who admittedly should have been the main villain for this season & introduces the Rescue Megazord.  The Turbo Megazord was okay, but this one was much cooler.  There's still no excuse for getting rid of my favorite Rangers, but if their actors wanted to leave, what else could they do?  So despite all my complaints, I enjoyed a decent amount of it.  The good episodes were truly enjoyable, and Chase Into Space really renewed my faith in the show.  And it's not the worst Power Rangers series.
3 stars.

In Space:  And now we come to my favorite season, season 6 or Power Rangers in Space (which is funny because 6 is my favorite number).  From the beginning I knew this would be my favorite.  The remaining Turbo Rangers became interesting characters and Andros was really cool.  The villains were the best.  The stories were really gripping.  And I loved the episode where they meet the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  But the best was the finale, which remains the best episode of Power Rangers ever.  Even as a kid I thought it was the end of Power Rangers, but for better or for worse it continued.  This season is just about perfect.  Really, outside of a few bad episodes the only way this could have been better would have been if Tommy & the others had lasted through Turbo to this series.
5 stars.

Lost Galaxy:  And so we end the Zordon era and come to a new era.  While this isn't as good as In Space or Zeo, aside from them, Time Force & maybe Mighty Morphin' season 3 it's the best Power Rangers series I've seen.  While it took me until the team-up episode to get into it as a kid, I was into it from the beginning when I watched it on DVD.  The characters are all great especially the villains (they were some of the most interesting PR villains ever) and the stories are still very good, though admittedly the finale could have been a bit better.  It's still great, but without spoiling anything it features a little cop-out that sort of ruins my favorite episode of the season.  It's not as bad as some things I've seen though it was still a bit annoying.  But overall this season proved that there was plenty of life left in the franchise.
5 stars.

So added up these seasons get 18 stars, divided by 4 equals 4.5, rounded up to 5 because of excellent special features, a very cool box, perfect chapter stops and the fact that the 2 best seasons are on here and one that will definitely be in my top 5.  The only complaint I have is about the booklet.  It's almost perfect, except for the fact that apart from the profiles we never see any pictures of the In Space Rangers.  To add insult to injury we get a picture from Turbo on one the pages detailing the In Space episodes.  But still, it helped me keep track of the episodes so it's better than nothing.  When my wallet's feeling really good I'll get seasons 8-12 & even the complete Mighty Morphin' set (for the special features).  They're not high priorities on my list of things to buy now, but I do know I'll like season 3 and some of the first 2 seasons, and all of seasons 8-12.",1382572800,,8779,4.295731707317073

The Power Rangers are normal everyday teenagers who are called upon when trouble comes and defends the planet from the evil forces.  The rangers never provoke a fight and conflict and only respond when there is danger.  Also each episode has a theme or story to tell about real life and what real teenagers go through.

3010472,5,1603998276,"So here is a nice review for this set. I will try and be as detailed with this set since i'm a huge pr fan. For starters, this is what you get:

Power Rangers Turbo: Complete Season - 5 dvds, 45 episodes
Power Rangers in Space: Complete Season - 5 dvds, 43 episodes

Episode booklet (i'm such a freak, but my name is in the thank you section here! i was soooo excited i got to help with a feature that made it to this set!)

Bonus dvd:

""It's Comin'"" Zeo Serial (18 Mins)(Collection of trailers promoting premiere of Zeo)
""Gold Lining"" Zeo Promo (22 secs)
""Stick Together"" Zeo Music Video (2 Mins)

So with that said, this is what i can say. This set is awesome! i haven't seen all the episodes yet, but i've seen the special features. To see those specials included after not seeing them in such a long time, especially since they haven't aired except the one time, was an awesome treat. the lost episode was my favorite special, as was power rangers funniest moments. the quality of the specials are dvd quality. no less. the behind the scenes featurettes was an awesome addition! love watching stuff like that.

now about the episodes themselves. some of you may come to realize that the opening credits for the ""a zeo beginning"" parts one and two are not the original broadcast versions. shout! factory was only able to find the rerun version of that ep premiere. if you remember, the opening originally used was the ""its coming!"" opening where you only see the ranger helmet symbols being cut out of the gold bar. in this boxset its the full opening credit sequence shown. i'm hoping in the next box set the original opening will be given as a bonus feature.

other than that the rest of zeo, turbo, in space and lost galaxy have no other issues. heck in this zeo thru lost galaxy set we actually get the ""last time on..."" and ""next time on..."" which really only happened a couple of times in power rangers zeo, but mostly all of turbo, in space and lost galaxy really had that short segment before and after the episodes. there is one power rangers in space episode that is missing i think the ""last time on..."" segment, its that or the ""next time on.."" thats missing, but every other episode that had it originally has it just like it aired back in the day which i totally appreciate brian ward for being able to get them on. that was one of the issues i had with the original mmpr 3 year collection. they didn't put on the ""today on ..."" segments. which with good reason i guess, since most of those segments were lost, or in bad shape, so i guess its ok but it was a let down.

just to be clear, yes at the end of the season finale for power rangers turbo the announcer is heard saying, and it is read as followings ""to be continued next season....power rangers in space!"". that was awesome to read and hear back in the day and its awesome they have that in this set. because in reruns of the show back in the day they omitted that lil sequence. so i'm glad it was added in for the dvd release.

the things i wish shout! factory were able to get but couldn't were the series premiere promos and trailers for each season. i remember the power rangers in space teasers they gave which i thought were soo awesome! especially the power rangers turbo teasers and promos before the series aired. i miss those and wish they were preserved so we could of gotten them on dvd.

these sets do come with closed captioning, but remember, they can't be shown on bluray players that use hdmi, only composite connections will show the closed captioning for those hearing impaired.

the artwork for the boxset is awesome! beautiful foil art. you just have to see it in your hands. beautiful work. the episode booklet gives you artwork and promo shots as well as bios for all the characters in the series as well as episode summaries which i thought was a great touch.

other than that, if your a power rangers fan, you should totally try and support this release. the episodes are the best we've ever seen, dvd quality work. its really thanks to all you guys who bought the sets from timelife last year, and who buy the smaller individual season releases as they are being released that we're able to see more and the rest of pr on dvd. yes if you haven't heard it already, ALL 20 seasons of pr from mmpr thru megaforce will be released in a limited edition 2000 print run called the legacy collection this december. but don't worry, mega sets will still be released just like this set and the mmpr collection set. in fact this november the next 5 years of power rangers will be released, lightspeed rescue thru dino thunder is the next confirmed mega set from shout! factory!

so please, continue to suppor these releases. tell your friends. i can't wait to get the rest of power rangers on dvd!

3010482,5,1603998276,"So if you've taken my advice and bought the MMPR set, you should buy this one as well since at this point you'll have 338 episodes, which is just twelve episodes shy of owning half the series (Shout Factory only has the rights to release up to RPM). Not too shabby for a show that just last year started having season releases. I'm still waiting on Batman to get the greenlight!

Zeo is one of the better seasons but it doesn't focus too heavily on story, most of the early episodes having a feel to the season one episodes featuring a problem of the day and the villains creating a monster based around said problem. To me that's not a bad thing but after the story heavy multi-parters of the previous season it could be seen that way for some. Once the Gold Ranger comes along does a story take shape with them trying to figure out who it could be (it really should've been Billy), to trying to keep the powers away from the villains and finally Jason having to return the powers after having them almost destroy him. I like the season overall but Zeo's shortcoming is the Machine Empire. Rita and Zedd may have leaned a little on the comedic side (thank you parents) but they always seemed a threat. Mondo and his ilk not so much. Only when Rita and Zedd returned later did they become interesting since now we had two villain factions fighting each other, the Tenga vs. Cog fight in the final episode being a highlight.

Sadly in Turbo, nothing was good. Except Divatox, but I know I'm in the minority on that one. Though I read somewhere that Rita and Zedd were supposed to make good on their threat of ""we're back"" and become the main villains again with Divatox returning later in the season. I only assume that's the reason why they had a cameo in the film since they apparently appear to be back in the Lunar Palace with Earth clearly in the background. I don't have much to say here except it was a poorly executed season that didn't know what to do with the Sentai footage. The only good episodes being the two-part finale which set up the brilliant following season. In Turbo's defense, I rank it higher than Operation Overdrive and Samurai. Not much of a compliment or defense but I feel they're far worse.

Banded together from remote galaxies are several of the most sinister villains from the previous seasons: The Legion of Do-I mean United Alliance of Evil (come on, it's so clearly the Power Rangers version of the Legion, all that's missing is a Darth Vader helmet-shaped headquarters - IN SPACE). Space was supposed to be the final season and it shows. I also find it rather creative on the writers' part on using the Sentai footage since what they thought was a space themed series was actually an electronics based one (which explains the different symbols on the Ranger helmets). We get a great set of villains and a good story to boot. I have nothing but praise for this season, the finale especially. I had bought the Best of DVD a few years ago and that two parter reminded me how grand and epic the series could be when done right. If I had any complaints it would be a few of the early episodes, such as the one where Andros gets involved with criminals, were weak. Also I would've loved to have seen more of Rita, Zedd, the Machine Empire and Divatox. Maybe not full on episodes but cameos here and there (Divatox had two before the finale) just to see them carrying out their part in the overall invasion. Wishful thinking on my part and I'm surprised no one's ever done any fanfiction about them during this season.

Lost Galaxy was the first time we had a new cast at the beginning of every season until the needless splitting of seasons starting with Samurai. At first I was turned off by it but I was thoroughly impressed with the season when I finally did watch it. Though it is uneven like the actual Lost Galaxy feeling more like filler instead of an intrical part of the story like the name suggests. It's another season with great villains (except Captain Mutiny) and an actual death or two (though one does come back to life at the end). I also like that they brought back Karone to be the second Pink Galaxy Ranger since they could continue her story (though it's wrapped up pretty quickly which was more wasted potential).

Again the features are great though I think the Bulk and Skull featurette should've been on the MMPR set and the one about the fans put on this one but whatever. The audio is again great and the transfers are good as well except in Zeo. Most episodes look good while others look fuzzy throughout.

So three out of four seasons in this set were great and I'm reminded of something one of the producers of the James Bond franchise said: ""We always start out trying to make another From Russia with Love and end up with another Thunderball"". I wish that the producers of this show would try to make another Zeo, Space, Time Force or RPM instead of what we've gotten with Samurai/Super Samurai, and as of now, Megaforce, being essentially MMPR again. I know the fans who grew up with the series aren't the target audience anymore (though now they're the adults with kids who make the spending decisions) and it will always remain a kids show but this set proves that we've had better material come out of this show. Anyways, here's to the next big box set, hopefully containing Lightspeed Rescue through Dino Thunder.",1365638400,19,5380,4.501535312180144

3244911,5,1603998276,"In my review on Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, I comment that it is to be bought with this boxed-set, and Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie.  Other fans might add that the other Power Rangers boxed-sets should also be bought alongside this, I'll express why I disagree.  These three items that I have listed are all part of the same story.  Except for Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy, they are continuations of each other, and Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy also makes references to much of it's predecessor season, Power Rangers in Space.

Power Rangers: Zeo is possibly Power Rangers at it's best (or Power Rangers in Space).  Although the original costumes, command center, zords, and villains have become the main icons for Power Rangers, I personally love the costumes, zords, the power chamber (wow, it looks so cool), and the new villains.  The Machine Empire are very entertaining villains, but we get the feeling that they're also very evil.  During the first portion of the show, before we get much storyline, the episodes are absolutely fantastic.  It's great.  We then start to move away from individual episodes to having more storyline in the overall show when Tommy goes on a personal journey, and we find out about his brother.  We then get a bunch of episodes about the mysterious gold ranger, and as soon as we find out who he is, Jason returns and gets the powers.  We then see the Machine Empire changing leaders around, until the final couple of episodes.  Power Rangers: Zeo also includes my favorite Power Rangers Christmas/Holiday special, one that celebrates the many different holiday (although like the others, I don't really care for them as part of the storyline of the overall show).

Power Rangers: Turbo is considered by many fans to be one of the worst.  However, I think it had some fantastic episodes, and even though it wasn't always as epic as previous seasons, it was still very enjoyable.  The show started where they had dinosaur-themed costumes and powers, powered by coins; their villain was a sorceress with a big dress, and she would get a headache whenever she would lose.  The sorceress was replaced by a big being of muscle with a metallic mask, he would glow red whenever he was angry, and they had aspects of their dinosaur-themed powers transformed into mythology-themed powers.  After that, the two villains unite, and get the addition of a giant skeleton, so they now get additional ninja powers and their zords are also ninja-themed.  After that, they get these powers that are a combination high-tech machinery and a magical crystal, and they're up against a machine royal family.  Now, with Turbo, they're up against a whiny woman with her clumsy henchmen, and they have new car-themed powers.  Although the new villain, Divatox, is nowhere near as menacing as the Machine Empire (or even Rita and Zedd), she and her henchmen always entertain the audience.  Their car-themed powers might seem to be a step down from the previous season, but their equipment proves itself to be very useful for these newer situations.  Also, a lot of fans might have complained about the newest member of the team being a twelve-year-old boy, but he actually proves himself to be extremely competent.  I also think it had a great movie to start it out, which isn't included in this boxed set, but you should buy it.  We have some pretty good episodes at the beginning, and then there is a switchover of rangers.  Except for Justin, the kid, all the previous rangers are replaced.  The new team is TJ, Cassie, Carlos, Ashley, and, as already mentioned, Justin.  We don't get major introductions to them before they become rangers although Carlos and Ashley appear in a couple of episodes beforehand.  However, we get to know them well when they become rangers, and there are some pretty good episodes here.  The story-arcs are not my personal favorites, but the individual episodes are mostly great, especially around the end.  Although Turbo is not a favorite amongst fans, I find it to be very enjoyable, and a great set-up to the next season.  It ends with a two-parter called Chase Into Space, where all of the rangers, except for Justin, leave Earth.

Power Rangers in Space is possibly my favorite, and a favorite for many other fans as well.  Zeo is definitely a close second for me, but Power Rangers in Space takes things to a whole new level.  The four rangers that replaced the previous rangers in Turbo join up with a ranger from outer space, named Andros.  They have high-tech (mostly computer-based) powers, and they regularly travel space.  The storyline is large.  Power Rangers: Turbo ends where Zordon (who gave them their powers at the beginning) is captured by the monarch of all evil.  Power Rangers in Space begins where the villains for all of the previous shows are together at a feast.  We are introduced to the new villain, Astronema.  Although she is joined by Elgar, the most clumsy henchman, from the previous season, we get the addition of Ecliptor, possibly one of the most impressive henchmen that we've seen so far.  He's show to be stronger than any of the other henchmen they've been up against, and his relationship with Astronema is much more complex than what we have had so far in Power Rangers.  We are also introduced to Darkonda, possibly the most evil of the villains we've had.  He and Ecliptor also are rivals with each other, and we get something much more complex than heroes vs. villains.  It gets even more complex when we find out that Astronema is Andros' long lost sister, Karone, and Ecliptor even helps her help the rangers.  However, the two of them are brainwashed, and we then get evil power rangers.  There is a fantastic story-arc here about the psycho rangers.  In previous seasons, we've seen evil power rangers, but those rangers were fairly easy to defeat.  The psycho rangers, however, are difficult to defeat.  Another major part of the storyline is their search for Zordon throughout space.  This season ends with a resolution to all of the previous seasons of Power Rangers resolved.  Usually for closing seasons (which this was partially meant to be), they regularly bring back people from all the previous seasons to reflect on the show.  However, I'm, in many ways, glad that they didn't do that.  There was a little bit of that, but mostly not.  This was an amazing season, and it ended the continuous storyline.

Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy is possibly my least favorite of these seasons.  Although many fans look fairly highly on it, it isn't my favorite.  On the other hand, Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy is how I got into Power Rangers, so I definitely can't complain there.  It does have a deeper storyline, and we have villains that are much more complex than typical villains.  I also love how this season takes place on a space station, and is even more in space than Power Rangers in Space.  This was the first Power Rangers season to really have it's own separate storyline, but it does regularly reference back to Power Rangers in Space.  Usually, when I go through watching Power Rangers, I watch this and then I watch the first six seasons.  However, it has some very deep stories, and it was what started the overall formula for Power Rangers.  I really don't have many bad things to say about Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy.  It's a pretty good season.

The special features here are also pretty good.  There's a documentary on Bulk and Skull, which includes a lot of talk about Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (one of the reasons to buy this with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers boxed set).  We get a documentary about the stunt team, and we also get a documentary on the Power Morphicon.  The one on the Power Morphicon is, in some ways, more of a commercial than a documentary, but I'm not complaining.  We also have a few Power Rangers: Zeo previews.  One was a trailer for the gold ranger saga, and the other was a serial of brief thirty-second spots to get people excited for Power Rangers: Zeo.  The serial isn't simply a bunch of basic trailers.  They made special footage to air for this, and if I was watching at the time, I would have definitely been on the edge of my seat.  The two other features are TV specials.  One of them is a funny moments from Power Rangers special, which is decent, but it includes quite a bit of straight up, unaltered, Super Sentai footage (Super Sentai is the show that Power Rangers is taken from).  The other TV special is the original pilot episode for the first season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, edited down a bit, with a couple of original cast members talking about the legacy of Power Rangers (although that was before it had the legacy it has now).  The special features here are fantastic.

Overall, I highly recommend this boxed set.",1413072000,,8787,4.74983498349835

3244916,4,1603998276,"I believe I must be the only one to make this observation, but how could they not include ''Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie'', the 1997 movie that served as the season opener for Power Rangers Turbo? You cannot go from the end of Power Rangers Zeo to the beginning of Power Rangers Turbo if you have not seen the movie, as you will be left completely confused: the movie is absolutely necessary in order to understand the events of Turbo, as one of the rangers leaves, a new one comes in, and the Zeo powers are replaced by the Turbo powers, all important moments in the Power Rangers series.

I can understand why they didn't include ''Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie'' in the Mighty Morphin' box set, as the events of that movie were refilmed for the television series, so that you can just skip the movie, but the Turbo movie is imperative to understand the beginning of Power Rangers Turbo. I suppose this is a rights issue? I can't really think of any other reason why it wouldn't be included....",1409702400,,1007,4.532967032967033

3244926,5,1603998276,"In my review of the first boxed set, I commented on nostalgia can make a show seem better in retrospect than it really was. This is true of Power Rangers just as much as other shows. And the same can be said for this boxed set, containing seasons 4-7 of the long-running show.

As with the first set, Shout! Factory has included all 183 episodes of seasons 4-7, which are subtitled ""Zeo,"" ""Turbo,"" ""In Space,"" and ""Lost Galaxy.""

""Zeo"" follows the Rangers as they gain new powers to fight off an alien invasion mighty enough to make Lord Zedd run away in fear. ""Turbo"" has the Rangers fighting off an evil space pirate named Divatox, and picks up after the second movie (not included in the set, so jumping straight into ""Turbo"" after ""Zeo"" might confuse some younger viewers who have not seen that film; and older viewers may, too, be confused further still by a ""time jump"" after Zeo, where a lot of threads are left unanswered). ""In Space"" sees the team joining up with a new leader, who is searching the galaxy for his lost sister, and ""Lost Galaxy"" sees an entirely new group of Rangers searching for a new world to call home.

As with the last set, the set's quality is superb. The box design is similar to the last, and the disc case artwork is excellent again, but I would have wished for more consistency in artwork between the two sets; place them on a shelf next to one another, and you'll see what I mean.

The show is the primary feature, but the bonuses are a treat as well. ""Tales of the Giant Banana"" is the highlight here, showcasing fan-favorite goons Bulk and Skull. There is also a feature on the stunt men of the show, the fan convention ""PowerMorphicon,"" and even the ""Lost Episode,"" which is one of the three versions of ""Day of the Dumpster,"" the pilot episode. There's more, but giving you a complete lowdown would constitute spoilers. The booklet is again included, with the character bios and episode guides, but still no airdate listings.

Shout! Factory again delivers a top notch set that will please fans of the show, and leave us eagerly anticipating the next set.",1394150400,,2096,4.549071618037135

3244943,5,1603998276,"Now THIS is the Ultimate Best of Power Rangers.  3 excellent seasons that still hold up, and one that's...okay.  Hardly the best but not quite the worst.  Here's my 2 cents on each season.

Power Rangers Zeo:  Admittedly, this was the biggest incentive for my purchase.  This was a DVD dream I've had for so long, it started out as a VHS dream.  In Space & Lost Galaxy had over half a dozen episodes released on VHS & a couple DVDs (Ninja Turtles The Next Mutation Volume 2 & the Best Of).  How many did Zeo get, outside of the first 2 episodes edited together with the Mighty Morphin' series finale into a movie?  It Came From Angel Grove and A Season to Remember; the only 2 episodes I remember seeing as a kid that I didn't like.  As soon as they were over 7 year old me was like ""That's it?  What a waste of an episode.""  Although to be fair, the former wasn't the worst episode of the season as it had a really cool monster of the week in Drill Master; which is more than some of the other duds from here can say (Season is still the worst though).  So anyways, I was desperate for a Zeo fix & got this the day it came out, & it's awesome.  Mighy Morphin' was okay, but didn't get really good until season 3. and this is even better.  As a kid this was my favorite until In Space.  I'm not the only one, there are several people on IMDB who were like ""This show abandoned most of the corny aspects of Power Rangers & became something better.""  For starters I have to admit, this is my favorite Ranger line-up.  Tommy was always my favorite, so it was great seeing him as the Red Ranger.  Adam, Rocky & Tanya are great & I have to admit, Kat is now my favorite Pink Ranger.  When I was younger I was a Tommy/Kimberly shipper, but upon watching some of Mighty Morphin' again, I found her to be my least favorite of the original 5.  So sorry, I'm now a Tommy/Kat shipper.  Oh, and don't forget my favorite of the original 5, Billy.  Poor, poor Billy.  They really should have let him be a Ranger again, but hey he was still a good character.  This season also has my favorite Megazords.  And personally I love the Machine Empire.  These days, I always get annoyed by Rita & her bunch.  Things got better when Lord Zedd came around, and though the episodes after he & Rita married are the best of the Mighty Morphin' era, I still never thought they were very interesting.  But not the Machine Empire.  I always looked forward to seeing King Mondo & his family scheming, & hearing Klank's Scottish accent.  Yes, they did the exact same thing as Rita & Zedd, but to this day I think they did it better, especially in the monster of the week department.  One of the reasons I like the Zeo villains is the same reason I like the ones in VR Troopers; robots are cool & any show with superheroes fighting evil robots every week is okay with me. To this day I think most of the costumes for the villains in both shows look pretty good.  There are a couple of silly ones in Zeo here & there, but unlike Mighty Morphin' these are the exception, not the rule.  It is also possible for episodes to be enjoyable despite the silly looking robots.  As good as the series is it peaks during the second half when the Gold Ranger shows up.  The mystery of who was behind the mask was really engaging.  As I said before, too bad it wasn't Billy.  But at least they brought back my other favorite of the original 5, Jason to become the Gold Ranger for a bit.  I especially liked when they got the Super Zeo Zords, it was so cool seeing the Rangers get Zords capable of handling monsters of the week on their own without having to combine.  And I loved the Super Zeo Megazord's first battle against an enlarged King Mondo.  I was like ""Finally, a high ranking villain comes down and fights the Rangers himself!""  And then Rita & Lord Zedd returned, and in their quest to regain their throne the unthinkable occurred...they became interesting.  They were desperate enough to actually help the Rangers.  It's always fascinating to see villains clash with each other, but personally as long as the Rangers weren't involved I was rooting for the Machine Empire all the way.  This season is still awesome and like I said, it was the best season until In Space.
5 stars.

Turbo: And now we hit the bump in PR's road to greatness.  Zeo didn't just have a promising start; it was a promising start to a better Power Rangers show.  This was at least half a dozen steps back.  Even as a kid I thought this was a step down from Zeo.  The villains aren't that bad.  I'm in the minority but I do like Divatox.  It's her henchmen that annoy me, but I do sometimes laugh at them.  They're still not as bad as Norg from Operation Overdrive.  It was all the changes that did it in for me.  Having a kid as a Ranger wasn't so bad, except for the episodes that focused on him.  The Justin episdoes were way too kiddy for me, even more so than the very first season of the franchise.  Dimitria was a decent replacement for Zordon, but Alpha 6 was much more annoying than his predecessor ever was.  To be honest Alpha 5 could be annoying at times, but he was still a fine character and I find it impossible to hate anyone who shares the same voice as Dagget Doofus Beaver (from Angry Beavers).  Alpha 6 sounds like Rocky Balboa on helium.  And then Tommy and the others left.  That did it for me back as a kid, & I didn't watch it again for a long time until the final 2 episodes aired.  But as I go through these episodes as an adult, I find they did improve a bit.  Apart from Chase Into space, my all-time favorite episodes are The Darkest Day, One Last Hope, The Fall of The Phantom & Clash Of The Megazords.  These episodes feature General Havoc, a villain who admittedly should have been the main villain for this season & introduces the Rescue Megazord.  The Turbo Megazord was okay, but this one was much cooler.  There's still no excuse for getting rid of my favorite Rangers, but if their actors wanted to leave, what else could they do?  So despite all my complaints, I enjoyed a decent amount of it.  The good episodes were truly enjoyable, and Chase Into Space really renewed my faith in the show.  And it's not the worst Power Rangers series.
3 stars.

In Space:  And now we come to my favorite season, season 6 or Power Rangers in Space (which is funny because 6 is my favorite number).  From the beginning I knew this would be my favorite.  The remaining Turbo Rangers became interesting characters and Andros was really cool.  The villains were the best.  The stories were really gripping.  And I loved the episode where they meet the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  But the best was the finale, which remains the best episode of Power Rangers ever.  Even as a kid I thought it was the end of Power Rangers, but for better or for worse it continued.  This season is just about perfect.  Really, outside of a few bad episodes the only way this could have been better would have been if Tommy & the others had lasted through Turbo to this series.
5 stars.

Lost Galaxy:  And so we end the Zordon era and come to a new era.  While this isn't as good as In Space or Zeo, aside from them, Time Force & maybe Mighty Morphin' season 3 it's the best Power Rangers series I've seen.  While it took me until the team-up episode to get into it as a kid, I was into it from the beginning when I watched it on DVD.  The characters are all great especially the villains (they were some of the most interesting PR villains ever) and the stories are still very good, though admittedly the finale could have been a bit better.  It's still great, but without spoiling anything it features a little cop-out that sort of ruins my favorite episode of the season.  It's not as bad as some things I've seen though it was still a bit annoying.  But overall this season proved that there was plenty of life left in the franchise.
5 stars.

So added up these seasons get 18 stars, divided by 4 equals 4.5, rounded up to 5 because of excellent special features, a very cool box, perfect chapter stops and the fact that the 2 best seasons are on here and one that will definitely be in my top 5.  The only complaint I have is about the booklet.  It's almost perfect, except for the fact that apart from the profiles we never see any pictures of the In Space Rangers.  To add insult to injury we get a picture from Turbo on one the pages detailing the In Space episodes.  But still, it helped me keep track of the episodes so it's better than nothing.  When my wallet's feeling really good I'll get seasons 8-12 & even the complete Mighty Morphin' set (for the special features).  They're not high priorities on my list of things to buy now, but I do know I'll like season 3 and some of the first 2 seasons, and all of seasons 8-12.",1382572800,,8779,4.295731707317073

The Power Rangers are normal everyday teenagers who are called upon when trouble comes and defends the planet from the evil forces.  The rangers never provoke a fight and conflict and only respond when there is danger.  Also each episode has a theme or story to tell about real life and what real teenagers go through.

So with that said, this is what i can say. This set is awesome! i haven't seen all the episodes yet, but i've seen the special features. To see those specials included after not seeing them in such a long time, especially since they haven't aired except the one time, was an awesome treat. the lost episode was my favorite special, as was power rangers funniest moments. the quality of the specials are dvd quality. no less. the behind the scenes featurettes was an awesome addition! love watching stuff like that.

now about the episodes themselves. some of you may come to realize that the opening credits for the ""a zeo beginning"" parts one and two are not the original broadcast versions. shout! factory was only able to find the rerun version of that ep premiere. if you remember, the opening originally used was the ""its coming!"" opening where you only see the ranger helmet symbols being cut out of the gold bar. in this boxset its the full opening credit sequence shown. i'm hoping in the next box set the original opening will be given as a bonus feature.

other than that the rest of zeo, turbo, in space and lost galaxy have no other issues. heck in this zeo thru lost galaxy set we actually get the ""last time on..."" and ""next time on..."" which really only happened a couple of times in power rangers zeo, but mostly all of turbo, in space and lost galaxy really had that short segment before and after the episodes. there is one power rangers in space episode that is missing i think the ""last time on..."" segment, its that or the ""next time on.."" thats missing, but every other episode that had it originally has it just like it aired back in the day which i totally appreciate brian ward for being able to get them on. that was one of the issues i had with the original mmpr 3 year collection. they didn't put on the ""today on ..."" segments. which with good reason i guess, since most of those segments were lost, or in bad shape, so i guess its ok but it was a let down.

just to be clear, yes at the end of the season finale for power rangers turbo the announcer is heard saying, and it is read as followings ""to be continued next season....power rangers in space!"". that was awesome to read and hear back in the day and its awesome they have that in this set. because in reruns of the show back in the day they omitted that lil sequence. so i'm glad it was added in for the dvd release.

the things i wish shout! factory were able to get but couldn't were the series premiere promos and trailers for each season. i remember the power rangers in space teasers they gave which i thought were soo awesome! especially the power rangers turbo teasers and promos before the series aired. i miss those and wish they were preserved so we could of gotten them on dvd.

these sets do come with closed captioning, but remember, they can't be shown on bluray players that use hdmi, only composite connections will show the closed captioning for those hearing impaired.

the artwork for the boxset is awesome! beautiful foil art. you just have to see it in your hands. beautiful work. the episode booklet gives you artwork and promo shots as well as bios for all the characters in the series as well as episode summaries which i thought was a great touch.

other than that, if your a power rangers fan, you should totally try and support this release. the episodes are the best we've ever seen, dvd quality work. its really thanks to all you guys who bought the sets from timelife last year, and who buy the smaller individual season releases as they are being released that we're able to see more and the rest of pr on dvd. yes if you haven't heard it already, ALL 20 seasons of pr from mmpr thru megaforce will be released in a limited edition 2000 print run called the legacy collection this december. but don't worry, mega sets will still be released just like this set and the mmpr collection set. in fact this november the next 5 years of power rangers will be released, lightspeed rescue thru dino thunder is the next confirmed mega set from shout! factory!

so please, continue to suppor these releases. tell your friends. i can't wait to get the rest of power rangers on dvd!

3244979,5,1603998276,"So if you've taken my advice and bought the MMPR set, you should buy this one as well since at this point you'll have 338 episodes, which is just twelve episodes shy of owning half the series (Shout Factory only has the rights to release up to RPM). Not too shabby for a show that just last year started having season releases. I'm still waiting on Batman to get the greenlight!

Zeo is one of the better seasons but it doesn't focus too heavily on story, most of the early episodes having a feel to the season one episodes featuring a problem of the day and the villains creating a monster based around said problem. To me that's not a bad thing but after the story heavy multi-parters of the previous season it could be seen that way for some. Once the Gold Ranger comes along does a story take shape with them trying to figure out who it could be (it really should've been Billy), to trying to keep the powers away from the villains and finally Jason having to return the powers after having them almost destroy him. I like the season overall but Zeo's shortcoming is the Machine Empire. Rita and Zedd may have leaned a little on the comedic side (thank you parents) but they always seemed a threat. Mondo and his ilk not so much. Only when Rita and Zedd returned later did they become interesting since now we had two villain factions fighting each other, the Tenga vs. Cog fight in the final episode being a highlight.

Sadly in Turbo, nothing was good. Except Divatox, but I know I'm in the minority on that one. Though I read somewhere that Rita and Zedd were supposed to make good on their threat of ""we're back"" and become the main villains again with Divatox returning later in the season. I only assume that's the reason why they had a cameo in the film since they apparently appear to be back in the Lunar Palace with Earth clearly in the background. I don't have much to say here except it was a poorly executed season that didn't know what to do with the Sentai footage. The only good episodes being the two-part finale which set up the brilliant following season. In Turbo's defense, I rank it higher than Operation Overdrive and Samurai. Not much of a compliment or defense but I feel they're far worse.

Banded together from remote galaxies are several of the most sinister villains from the previous seasons: The Legion of Do-I mean United Alliance of Evil (come on, it's so clearly the Power Rangers version of the Legion, all that's missing is a Darth Vader helmet-shaped headquarters - IN SPACE). Space was supposed to be the final season and it shows. I also find it rather creative on the writers' part on using the Sentai footage since what they thought was a space themed series was actually an electronics based one (which explains the different symbols on the Ranger helmets). We get a great set of villains and a good story to boot. I have nothing but praise for this season, the finale especially. I had bought the Best of DVD a few years ago and that two parter reminded me how grand and epic the series could be when done right. If I had any complaints it would be a few of the early episodes, such as the one where Andros gets involved with criminals, were weak. Also I would've loved to have seen more of Rita, Zedd, the Machine Empire and Divatox. Maybe not full on episodes but cameos here and there (Divatox had two before the finale) just to see them carrying out their part in the overall invasion. Wishful thinking on my part and I'm surprised no one's ever done any fanfiction about them during this season.

Lost Galaxy was the first time we had a new cast at the beginning of every season until the needless splitting of seasons starting with Samurai. At first I was turned off by it but I was thoroughly impressed with the season when I finally did watch it. Though it is uneven like the actual Lost Galaxy feeling more like filler instead of an intrical part of the story like the name suggests. It's another season with great villains (except Captain Mutiny) and an actual death or two (though one does come back to life at the end). I also like that they brought back Karone to be the second Pink Galaxy Ranger since they could continue her story (though it's wrapped up pretty quickly which was more wasted potential).

Again the features are great though I think the Bulk and Skull featurette should've been on the MMPR set and the one about the fans put on this one but whatever. The audio is again great and the transfers are good as well except in Zeo. Most episodes look good while others look fuzzy throughout.

So three out of four seasons in this set were great and I'm reminded of something one of the producers of the James Bond franchise said: ""We always start out trying to make another From Russia with Love and end up with another Thunderball"". I wish that the producers of this show would try to make another Zeo, Space, Time Force or RPM instead of what we've gotten with Samurai/Super Samurai, and as of now, Megaforce, being essentially MMPR again. I know the fans who grew up with the series aren't the target audience anymore (though now they're the adults with kids who make the spending decisions) and it will always remain a kids show but this set proves that we've had better material come out of this show. Anyways, here's to the next big box set, hopefully containing Lightspeed Rescue through Dino Thunder.",1365638400,19,5380,4.501535312180144
