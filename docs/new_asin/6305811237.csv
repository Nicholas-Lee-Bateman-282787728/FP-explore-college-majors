8157948,4,6305811237,"Until the last decade, Charlton Heston's reputation was that of a Hollywood icon who could convincingly portray epic roles such as Judah Ben-Hur, Moses, The Cid, Michaelangelo, and John the Baptist, to name just a few. Today, however, he is recogized primarily as a political icon, particularly by virtue of his leadership role with the National Rifle Association. As with any generalization, this is unfortunate, because Heston is an intelligent, introspective man who has lived a dynamic professional life and, unlike many of those in his profession, enjoys a happy personal life. The video documents his participation in college dramatics, move to Broadway, subsequent work in early television, and eventual segue to Hollywood where his physical prescence and thoughtful approach to acting earned him accolades from, directors, co-workers, and audiences throughout the world. Most interesting are the interviews with his wife, Lydia, their daughter, Holly, his closest friend, Dr. Jolly West (who died shortly afterwards), and his political counterpart in Hollywood and former co-star, Gregory Peck. An interview with Heston's  son Fraser, himself a film director, is unfortunately missing, but given the limitations of time, this is a well-rounded look at an actor whose work not only in epics but westerns, film noir and science fiction genres is indelible.",975369600,,1362,5.516746411483253
