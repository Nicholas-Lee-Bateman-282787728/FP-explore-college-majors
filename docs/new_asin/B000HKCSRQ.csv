The leader, Todd Durkin, is motivating and positive.  He explains the benefits of each stretch and why it is so important to stretch.  I guess I'm what he describes as a ""desk jockey"" and they work for me.  I feel better after using it.  I also have a previous injury in which these particular stretches seem to help.  After being told that I might never regain full flexibility in my left hamstring, I have begun to see and feel improvement.  I like the way it has different types of stretching.  I sometimes do all the segments or just particular one.  I rarely do the wall stretches because I have no open wall space like the kind required.  They look effective and fun though.

I have watched and bought several of his other videos.  I wish I could attend his conferences.",1313280000,,899,4.375757575757576
