8395695,1,B003EV5BL0,"As a member of a family with deep Lowel roots - more than 5 generations - we had high hopes for this video.  The theme is credible and the attempt is admirable but falls far short of good.  Yet as another reviewer noted, the audio is quite compromised and poor.  It's also not a very dynamic documentary - much is filmed / told as a stand still.  It does not really illuminate farming nor the earlier days of Lowell, which has such a rich American history.",1465689600,,456,4.267441860465116
8395696,1,B003EV5BL0,"The reviews are BS.  DO NOT PURCHASE.  All dialogue is drowned out with idiot music.
Wasted 1.99.  Szava-Kovats and his cadre of fake reviewers are here to take your  money.",1465084800,,173,4.666666666666667
8395697,5,B003EV5BL0,"This is a film that, for the life of me, I don't understand why it was written and produced. Good, hard working family, no doubt,  but it just seems to be an appeal to keep the place open.",1447027200,,188,3.9473684210526314
8395698,3,B003EV5BL0,"Interesting...but for the continual background 'noise'.  I was really glued to what Rollie and the rest of the gang were saying...but the continual obtrusive 'noise' in the background ruined  this sketch of farm life for me because it often made it difficult to differentiate between what Rollie and the others were saying.  If this were a discussion on 'Jazz' instead of farming, then it might have worked.

  I am also a grower and have been one for as long as Rollie, and so I was looking forward to hearing what he had to say.  Many of the things he talked about I have discovered for myself.  I would have liked to hear him talk with only silence in the backgound as is done in documentaries though.

  ...please...Rollie... RE-EDIT this video and get rid of the distractive noise that detracted from imparting your very valuable insights.",1315180800,8,844,4.751724137931035

The filmmaker, Andrew Szava-Kovata, is both an artist and a musician. Being trained in both the visual and sonic arts gives him the unique perspective of being able to simultaneously focus on both the cinematographic as well as the sound recording functions of filmmaking. This is a rare and valuable quality. His talents at documentary filmmaking are in full force here in this latest film about the last farm in Lowell, Massachusetts.

People usually do not think of Lowell, Massachusetts as a rural area with country qualities and woodsy landscapes. But at one time, before Lowell was carved out of Chelmsford, Dracut, and Tewksbury - straddling both sides of both the Concord and the Merrimack Rivers - it was a beautiful and bucolic place to live. The Pawtucket, Penacook, Massachusetts, and Wamesit Indians of this area who had lived on this land for thousands of years were well aware of its intrinsic natural beauty with its two rivers, rolling hills, mini mountains, and many fields and streams that ran along old Indian trails through the woods all over the landscape. It is still a breathtakingly beautiful place, especially looking down from hilly Belvidere in the northeast (once a village hamlet of North Tewksbury and a Wamesit Indian Podunk village before that) out and onto the Merrimack River in the north, bordering Dracut on its west banks, as it rolls its way northeast toward the Atlantic Ocean at Newburyport, Massachusetts. One can imagine how much joy it brought its First Nation indigenous inhabitants to look out onto that river as it winded its way toward the sea. It is a truly beautiful and magnificent site, especially in the spring, when the river is high and flowing with power and speed.

Just up the banks of the river, but on the northwest end of its body - closer to New Hampshire, and on the Dracut side of the river, near the Dracut State Forest - lies Varnum Avenue, named after a very renowned, founding family of the greater Lowell area. If you drive up Varnum Avenue heading northwest, before you enter New Hampshire, you will eventually reach Rollie's Farm up on the right - literally ""The Last Farm in Lowell."" It's true. Rollie is the last farmer in the whole city of Lowell, Massachusetts to make his living from working a family farm. He has been doing it for years, and he has perfected his operation to the point where it is both a science and art. He grows the best food around. With his own hands, and some loyal helpers, he works that farm year-round to produce the sweetest corn, the juiciest tomatoes, and the most aromatic and good looking Christmas trees in the Merrimack Valley if not all of Middlesex County. Rollie takes pride in his work, and he treats his helpers with dignity and respect. When harvest time comes, all of his patrons and customers of his farm stand are there to buy the best tasting, locally grown, and fresh food to be found in the whole area. As Peter, his drum teacher and farm helper, says in the movie: ""It's a thing!"" People drive for miles to be a part of that thing!

Andrew Szava-Kovats has not only done a great service to documenting the life of his newfound friend, Rollie the Farmer, he has also done us all a great service in documenting a fast-fading way of life: the life of the family farm. That Rollie's farm is, indeed, the last farm in Lowell is a very sad testament to the standing of family farms and local produce. That we have come to this point where, in the fourth largest city of Massachusetts with a population of over 100 thousand to feed on a daily basis, there is only one functioning family farm left to feed the people of this area with fresh, homegrown produce grown with loving care and human pride is a very sad statement on the state of affairs of how we as people value our food supply. Rollie is a living testament to someone who is willing to stand his ground and continue to do his thing as a proud and independent, agricultural entrepreneur in this digital age of corporate, Monsanto-controlled mega-farms that have no respect for the land the food grows on or the people who work the fields. God bless Rollie and all of the other small family farmers just like him who are still out there, standing their ground, working the land, and keeping us all alive and healthy with the locally grown good food that they produce.

I am a drummer like Rollie and his friend Peter who works on the farm with him. Drummers are musicians, indeed, but they are also of a serious bent in the sense that they see the value of the whole picture. They are not just there to play their part like some other piece of the orchestra. Drummers keep the whole thing going from start to finish. They drive the band and guide the rest of the musicians through the composition. They lay the foundation and keep the engine wheels rolling along the tracks all the way to the next station / song. They can see the whole forest and not just focus on individual trees. A drummer's perspective on music is unique in that a drummer absolutely must always be right on time and always must be aware of what needs to come next in order to guide the rest of the musicians along the path of the music. A drummer is not just there to keep the beat and add accents. A drummer is there to drive the whole thing along and make sure that it is all held together as one functioning organic whole.  After watching The Last Farm in Lowell, I can honestly say that what makes Rollie such a great farmer is that he is a great drummer. Watch him play, and you'll see what I mean!

Andrew Szava-Kovats has been making art and music for decades, and now as a film documentarian, he is making movies that capture the little hideaway places of our lives that most other people might not ever give a second thought. It is those second thoughts that sometimes end up becoming the most interesting or important parts of our lives. It is good to know that there are filmmakers like him who still have the ability to see through the ouster shells and get to the precious pearls that exist inside. ""The Last Farm in Lowell"" is just such one of these pearls. It is rich. It is elegant. But above all, it is precious! ...
