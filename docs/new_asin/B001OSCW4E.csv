8331333,5,B001OSCW4E,"This DVD is absolutely excellent. If you are a student of Shotokan, this DVD will help you perfect your katas. It is sometimes hard to learn a kata from the instructor alone; some people just have a hard time visualizing the steps, much less what each technique is actually portraying as far as practical self-defense techniques. This DVD makes each step of the katas clear, showing eacg from different angles and also showing the practical applications for each technique. I found that the lines which are marked on the floor were also very helpful. The demonstrations are great and provide the student with excellent examples of how the katas should look when performed correctly.

The quality of the DVD is wonderful and seems to be much more professionally filmed and edited than many of the other martial arts videos on the market. Overall, I highly recommend this, as well as the other DVD's by Joel Ertl and Anita Bendickson. Over the years, the high quality videos from these two instructors have helped me perfect my katas, as well as helping me better explain and teach these katas to my students. I absolutely can find nothing negative to say about these DVD's at all. They are top of the line and if you are a student of Shotokan karate, I urge you to get your own copy; they will help you on your quest to earn your blackbelt in Shotokan - bottom line. 5+ Stars!

8331334,5,B001OSCW4E,"This DVD was very useful for me in preparing for my brown and black belt tests (3rd, 2nd, 1st kyu, and shodan) and I will need it again for my nidan test in a couple of years.  It is very professionally done by people who have been teaching traditional Shotokan karate together for about 30 years.  Clearly, senseis Ertl and Bendickson know and can demonstrate every nuance and detail of the kata.  Each kata is presented by introduction, embusen, move by move, breakdown, and full speed demonstration.  The narration is descriptive and crystal clear.  I've seen and helped produce instructive videos myself, and I can say that this is as good as anything I've seen done by the pros.  It is quite uncommon to have expert-level instruction combined with professional-level production.  Worth every penny if you are serious about learning these katas.",1231113600,3,849,4.936619718309859
