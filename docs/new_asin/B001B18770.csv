3478301,5,B001B18770,"THE CASE FOR FAITH
4 Stars - Uplifting

The visual presentation of Lee Strobel's book ""The Case For Faith"" is compelling.  As a follow-up volume from his first book, The Case For Christ, the award-winning journalist applies his investigative skills once again to the questions of Christian beliefs by taking on the doubts that inevitably plague the thoughtful believer.

Using the loss of faith of Charles Templeton as a model for the way doubt can capture the mind, Strobel questions this personal friend and contemporary of Billy Graham.  Noting that he was one of the greatest evangelists during the 1940's, Templeton explains in his own words the two doubts that cost him his faith.  The first is what he calls ""the insufferable claim that Jesus is the only true way to God"" and the second is the problem of believing in a good God when the world is full of suffering.

Further researching the question of what are the most common doubts that disturb Christians, Strobel finds that these issues are not unique to Templeton.  Both are common not only to current Christians but are also found in the writings of major theologians of the past, including St. Augustine who lived in the 4th century.  Quoting Augustine, he expresses the second doubt in this way: ""If there is no God, why is there so much good?  If there is a God, why is there so much evil?""

In presenting the best answers to the ""problem of evil"" and the universal experience of suffering, Strobel takes us to conversations with leading theologians alive today as well as to some of the best Christian writers, such as C.S. Lewis.  The list of scholars includes N.T. Wright, Bishop of Durham, England, Craig Hazen of Biola University, Gregory Koul, author of Stand to Reason, J.P. Moreland of Talbot School of Theology and Ben Witherington of Asbury Theological Seminary.  Additionally, Joni Eareckson Tada presents her own experience as a person living with suffering and experiencing God's larger purposes working through her and her disability as a quadriplegic person.  The final representative is Pastor Rick Warren of Saddleback Church who provides a pastoral presence.

This documentary blends scripture throughout the study and honors the intellectual difficulty of answering these questions.  Struggling with doubt is part of the nature of faith and the film neither shies away from the questions nor assumes that every person will find the answers satisfying.  Explaining that he sent a copy of the manuscript to Templeton shortly before his death in 2001, Strobel recognizes that he may not have found his way back to the Jesus who Templeton honestly admits he misses.

The thoughtful presentation of the questions and answers of common doubts results in a film that is worthy of both the believer's and the skeptic's time and consideration.  It is only available on DVD.

Discussion:

1. The claim by Jesus that He is ""the way, the truth and the life"" and that ""no one comes to the Father except by Me"" is seen by Christians as a statement of fact.  Therefore, it is not seen as an exclusive claim but a truthful explanation.  What do you believe about this statement?  What study have you done to support your belief?

2. The explanation that God must allow human freedom because without it, love is not possible also explains what happens when some humans choose to not love but rather to harm: people suffer.  This ""evil"", which is the inversion of the word ""live"", is therefore only the misuse of human freedom and an inversion of the purpose of the lives we live.  Does this answer satisfy you or not?  If not, what is a more satisfying explanation to you for the suffering in our world?

3. The respect that Strobel shows Templeton is how Christians should treat all people with or without honest doubts.  Do you believe this is the common way that Christians treat others?  Why do you answer as you do?

The Association of Christian Faculty at the University of California at Santa Barbara will be using all three of Lee Strobel's DVDs this year to lead discussions in lecture halls, dorms, and departmental conference rooms in making the case for the Creator, the case for faith, and the case for Christ.  The DVDs are that good. They will inspire Christians and give them solid reasons  for their faith. They will also give skeptics good reasons to be skeptical of their skepticism.

""Case for Faith"" is phenomenal. Now stop reading and go buy it.",1223078400,13,697,4.735537190082645

honesty and sublime humility. It is, I believe, the most honest, most courageous Christian film ever made, bracing in its aspiration and moving in its conclusions. Lee Strobel is obviously a thinker, but he is foremost a seeker of truth, and in this film Lee Strobel, while obviously a proponent of ""faith in Christ,"" dodges nothing. This DVD stirs the mind and touches the heart. If you are not satisfied with cheap answers, superficial dogma, and peripheral paradigms of faith, if you want to get right at the heart of the faith journey, even to places where knotty questions vex and suffering swells, this film takes you there. This film drives straight into the Faith's darkest tunnels and leads the traveler to the other side, bathed in new light and new hope.",1222819200,34,989,4.92814371257485

3478325,5,B001B18770,"WOW! I have been looking for a video like this for years! A video that takes the basic precepts of Christianity and explains them to a general audience. I love that they reference ""Mere Christianity"" and the wisdom that C.S. Lewis imparts about his study of the Christian faith (btw, if you read the writings of early Christians, i.e., Augustine, Tertullian, Ambrose, Athanasius, etc. you will see where C.S. Lewis got much of his theology...).

I thought this was such a powerful video for evangelism (especially for the youth of America) I just bought 5 more copies to share with different youth groups I'm involved with. They should broadcast this video 24/7 on some TV station so the entire world could come to understand that if everyone accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior, and modeled their life after his teachings, there would be world peace: no more hunger, no more thirst, no more homelessness, no more loneliness, no more ignorance, no more fear, no more hate. It's what we all want but choose many false gods hoping they will get us there. It just doesn't work and God allows the centuries to roll by hoping we learn from our mistakes and finally figure out that Jesus truly is the Way, the Truth and the Life.

But sadly, we live in a country that despises Christ and shuns him from our government, our classroom, and our courts. And yet, we continually ask God to ""Bless America..."" What hypocrites we must appear in the eyes of God.

But this video. Share it with everyone you know. Let peace begin with me...

3478332,1,B001B18770,"This book should be called ""The Case of Red Herrings"" instead of the case for faith. The author certainly writes well, but it is the content and not the presentation that is the problem with this book. The arguments in this book are poorly formed, demonstrating a basic understanding of reasoned thought. I should have known that the book would have these faults when he praises the book ""Socrates Meets Jesus"" which is one of the worse books I have ever had the misfortune to read.

The core problem with this book is that the author entirely misses the point. The author lists eight questions which he then attempts to answer in order to provide a justification for faith. Now let's put aside for a moment on how poorly these questions are answered. The question are at best secondary questions. In order to provide a case for faith you have to tell me WHY I should believe in God. For example, he asks the question if there is a loving God why is there  evil in the world. The question, however, is irrelevant. We know that there is evil in the world, but that does not disprove God. We may not understand God's motivation, but the fact that there is evil in the world does not mean that he does not exist. Neither does it prove that he does exist. God's existence is not based on whether there is or isn't evil in the world. God's existence depends on wether or not he exists. So deal with that question.

3478353,4,B001B18770,"Lee Strobel is one of my favorite spiritual authors and I've read most of his books. In this DVD he presents two sides of a story. On one hand he interviews a man who has lost his faith. On the other he himself represents a man who has gained faith. It was interesting to see how he answered questions Charles Templeton struggled with. This DVD addresses questions like:

How can God be loving if there is suffering, disease and death?
Is there only one way to God?
Is it OK to have doubts and still be a Christian?
Why do the major religions of the world contradict each other?
Which religion has the true answers to solve life's major dilemmas?

Some of the answers will put your mind at ease. After watching this you will understand the source of evil. You will also understand that it is OK to have doubts.

What I came away with was that compared with eternity with God, this life is fairly insignificant. The fact that we are strengthened by our troubles was also reinforced.

I think if you feel uncertainty and confusion this might be one of the DVDs you are supposed to watch.

While most of this DVD is beautifully done there are a few images that may be disturbing. Mostly they have to do with death. Probably nothing you haven't seen on the news.

One thing you should not miss out on while watching this movie is the extra bonus documentaries. They are very touching and healing and encourage Christians to get more involved in solving the world's major problems.

3478376,2,B001B18770,"This DVD addresses two objections to Christianity:
1. How can Christians be so arrogant as to claim they have the only way to God?
2. How can evil exist in the world if God is all loving, all powerful, and all knowing?

The first question is troubling to adherents of a postmodern worldview where no viewpoint is superior to any other.  My answer to this objection is to imagine a line of 1,000 people.  Further imagine that each person is asked ""what is 2+2?""  Now imagine that just one person answers ""4"" and he further adds that ""everyone else has it wrong.""  Is this viewpoint correct?  Absolutely!  Is it arrogant?  I don't think so.  Proclaiming that you have something right and everyone else has it wrong should not be troubling especially to folks who believe that everyones opinion is equally valid.

The second question addressed in the DVD is: how can evil exist in the world if an all loving God exists?  The Christian answer is that God gave humans free will. God has not created evil but he has allowed for humans to choose it.  Only in this way can humans love God.  (If humans had no choice but to follow God than they couldn't love him - love is not something that can be coerced)

This review covers in 60 seconds what took the film 60 minutes to say.  Read this review, skip the DVD, and save yourself an hour.",1289001600,3,1330,4.43801652892562
3478377,5,B001B18770,"Although it is only about an hour and twenty minutes long, 'The Case For Faith' DVD provides a powerful and effective response to two of the biggest objections to Christianity.  The main focus is answering the exclusiveness of Christianity (that Jesus is the only way to God) and the problem of evil and suffering (how a loving God could/would allow so much pain and misery to exist).

This video is based upon the book of the same name by Lee Strobel.  In this, Strobel visits a lot with Charles Templeton who was a friend and former evangelist partner of Billy Graham several decades ago.  Mr. Templeton lost his Christian faith over the two objections listed above.  Mr. Strobel takes his complaints seriously and examines each.  During the course of this examination, he interviews several well known figures such as authors J.P. Moreland, Greg Koukl, and Joni Eareckson Tada and Biola professor Craig Hazen.

Strobel gives viewers lots to ponder in this video.  It is well worth watching for Christians who want to be able to respond more effectively, seekers, and skeptics.

Holy Spirit is the Consciousness and Conscientiousness of God; Church choirs are metaphors representing the sound of the Amazing Grace that comes from being imbued with its light.

3478387,3,B001B18770,"I give this DVD high marks for effort, but low marks for Biblical accuracy. As a student of the Bible, I found that many of the 'experts' interviewed were more interested in ""popular Christian"" views than ""Biblically accurate"" views. That might explain why they almost never quoted the Bible even though they claimed to be speaking for it. Their reasoning was so bad I left the room a couple of times to go find other things to do. Eventually I watched the DVD in its entirety, and was less than pleased at the way Strobel packaged it.

1. Christians will often say that God allows freedom in order to make love possible. Respectfully.. can someone please show me where this is in the Bible? You can find 100 ""Christian"" philosophers to say it, but can you find one *Bible verse* to say it? If so, please let me know so I can finally get off this soap box. Not only is this concept nowhere in the Bible, but embracing it puts one in the horrible position of being completely unable to explain the myriad of verses where God deliberately hardens people's hearts and blinds their eyes so that they cannot make a moral decision in His favor. [NOTE: There are several reasons to explain why God did this, and I'll be happy to discuss them with you. But the reasons presented in DVD leave no room for this often-repeated aspect of God's character.] Here are a *few* examples of this principle at work:
- Pharaoh (Exodus, specifically Ex 10:1-2 or 14:17, etc, etc. Please read *why* God said He would do these things and note that Paul affirms this same reason in Rom 9:17-18. This side of God never came out in the DVD);
- King Sihon (Deut 2:30)
- Canaanites (Josh 11:19-20. Like it or hate it, please note what this plainly says about God's *intent*. This, too, never came out in the DVD)
- Jews themselves (Deut 29:2-4)
- Nation of Israel (Isaiah 6:9-10. BTW.. let me demonstrate to you how resistant people are to the harsh reality of God's holiness. Read the entire chapter and ask yourself how many Christian songs you've heard that reflect the themes of each verse [there are lots] ... and then ask yourself why no one sings about verses 9-10 of this same chapter. While you're chewing on that, note that while no one sings about v9&10, those verses are directly quoted or referred to in Matthew (twice, actually), Mark, Luke (twice), John, Acts, Romans, 2 Corinthians, 2 Peter and more. Why did all these NT writers feel it necessary to bring up these verses, but you can barely find a preacher in the 21st century to preach them??!!?? Kinda makes you say 'hmmmmm')
- Jews (Is 29:10-12; Is 63
- King of Assyria (Is 10:5-12)

And this isn't only in the Old Testament

- Jews (Matt 11:25-26; Matt 13:13-15; Mark 4:12; Luke 8:10; Luke 10:21; John 12:37-40; Acts 28:26-27)
- (And just to make sure we don't miss anyone) Everyone who doesn't believe (Rom 11:7-8)

Folks, I could go on, but hopefully you see that this is a recurring theme in the Bible. I have my theories on how it all fits, but whatever is going on in God's mind in these verses was not represented at all in this DVD. Sorry, but that's just plain wrong!

2. In answering the question of ""why is there suffering"", Strobel & company are correct to say that sinners of all stripes (myself included) deserve a fate far worse than suffering on earth. But they made this a minor point, not the main point. Yikes! The Bible is abundantly clear that all sin and all sinners will be punished in hell forever (Rom 3:23; Rom 3:9-18, etc, etc). I think Strobel soft-pedaled that answer to his detriment. IMHO, too often, Christians get sidetracked by God's love that they don't see God's holiness as His central character. Because of this lopsided view of Him, they find themselves unable to explain many things in the world. The fact of the matter is that any day alive on earth, regardless of the pain and misery one endures, is far better than spending that same day in hell. As creatures born in sin (we all are), God has every right to instantly destroy us all in hell ...and will do so. (If you want to know why God keeps us alive at all, Rom 9:22-23 might be one hint) In fact, Jesus spoke more on hell and judgment than any other topic, bar none. More than heaven. More than love. (One might think He was trying to say something, eh?) The good news here is that we don't have to die an eternity in hell just because we were born as sinners. Because God is love, He made a plan by which we can escape the punishment He execute: Jesus, being the only God-Man to walk this earth, was sent by God to the cross to take on the hell that God aimed at us. God punished Him for our sins (Isaiah 53). By believing in Jesus' person, work and message, and dedicating our lives to Him (ie ""abide"" in Him), we get to take advantage of His death as payment for our sins. God then no longer finds us in need of eternal punishment. Personally, I find that plan unfathomable - but it's the one laid out in the Bible and I embrace it wholly and without reservation. What's even weirder still is that God and Jesus made this plan of salvation *before* they even made the world! That sounds offensive and bizzare - but like it or not, that's what the Bible says. (It even says that many of you will find this offensive and a stumbling block - 1 Peter 2:6-8).

As this relates to suffering - the simple fact of the matter is that man, in sinning, curses himself and separates himself and all his offspring from a holy God. God is not Santa Claus (we need to quit thinking of Him that way). The Bible never paints Him as one who is obligated to step in and rescue man from the consequences of his own actions. Like it or hate it, that's the Bible's take on it. Man's suffering is man's own fault - but regardless of the reasons, beware: an even greater suffering lies in store for all of us. We'd best repent before its too late (This is exactly Jesus' logic in Luke 13:1-5. Strobel and company missed the boat.) Instead of focusing on a ""good God in an evil world"", they should have focused on a ""holy God vs an evil world"". That's the way the Bible presents it.

I'm convinced that people will never understand God so long as they don't understand Holiness and Righteousness (as HE defines these terms). This DVD did not help in that regard. When I examine what the Bible has to say for itself, I find Strobel's 8 questions answered to my satisfaction. I wish he would have brought theologians to the table who would explain the Bible's perspective and not their own personal opinions (there was waaaaay too much of that going on).

Granted, scrutinizing the Bible make me ask a whole different set of probing questions, but I would expect nothing less from a God who truly is The Almighty. It makes the pursuit of Him mysterious, amazing, rewarding and worthwhile. Highly recommended!",1259971200,16,6826,4.45083932853717

3478389,5,B001B18770,"This is one of Lee Strobel's best dvds just because it tackles head on the question that most of us would love to ask God to His face:  Why does evil exist?  Why do good people suffer?  Why do good people get hurt or die, apparently needlessly?  All these questions are taken head on in this dvd and just because of the subject matter, I strongly recommend all Christians watch this dvd.",1249171200,,387,4.333333333333333

3478392,1,B001B18770,"This video was shown Sunday in our adult Sunday school class. I walked out after N. T. Wright appeared on the screen. This man believes Jesus Christ and Paul followed their own agendas. He humanizes the Bible and Christ. In His book ""What Saint Paul Really Said"" Wright states: ""Jesus believed himself to be called to a particular role in the Eschatological drama; and so did Paul."" Jesus is God. God knew and preordained before the foundation of the earth was laid that He would become God-man. It wasn't as if He suddenly came to the conclusion that he had to perform some kind of religious role playing for history sake. Paul wrote the words of God and did not set out to pursue his own agenda. He was called of God without question. Paul and Christ ""believed"" is the standard statement of this man who is an Anglican Priest who preaches at Westminster Abby, a church of the apostasy. Very liberal in all arenas. This church has ancient Idols of the Catholic Mary displayed. I have been at Westminster Abby and the Anglican priests certainly are not Spirit-filled or of God. Their prayers state that Britian's laid to rest kings and queens are in heaven and visitors must reverence their tombs that are placed everywhere in Westminster Abby. This includes all the wicked who sat on the throne--murderers, adulterers, idolaters, habitual liars, blasphemers, etc; who made a name for themselves within this empire. The priests are not about to preach the true Gospel and that salvation can only be obtained this way.

Wright is called the theologian for everyone, as he takes no solid stands on theology. He does not oppose homosexuality or any form of sexual promiscuity. In ""What St. Paul Really Said,"" Wright states on page 156 that it (sex) is not to be ignored, denied or repressed according to Paul. Wright is a liar who leads many astray; yet, is quoted as a valuable recourse in this DVD and by many prominent so-called believers. Rick Warren is also in this video and he fellowships with homosexuals as he works with them to bring his PEACE plan to fruition. Rick Warren is also very liberal and stands with evil men who uphold every agenda opposed to Christ. Rick Warren writes his own doctrine as if he is God. However, it is Rick Warren's religion.

This video starts out on a very crazy note trying to figure out why Charles Templeton left the faith. The Apostle John states ""they left us because they were not of us;"" 1 John 2:19. The answer is simplistic. Those who are not of the true faith often leave the solid church that will not compromise.

The Bible also makes it vividly clear that we are to have nothing to do with the false teachers (2 Peter, Jude, 2 John, etc.) and this includes Templeton. Lee Srobel was in the wrong to enter this heretic's home.

Believers are not called to listen to those who teach contrary or try and figure them out. These deceived ones speak satan's words and we are to stay clear. They are those who know the Gospel and they must not be played with spiritually as if they are innocent children. Christ and his disciples had nothing to do with the false teachers. They did not go and interview the Pharisees, Scribes and Sadducees and try and pick their brains to locate spiritual answers as to why they did not believe. They never sought fellowship with these wicked men.

Believers must only seek answers in the inerrant, holy, and immutable Word of God. They are to study to show themselves approved handling it accurately, using a reliable Bible translation such as the New King James. They are to delve into the Scriptures solely for truth.

It was very wrong for Strobel to play the silly games Hollywood plays, presenting man's stupidity with state-of-the-art productions.",1232928000,15,3732,4.6814024390243905
3478393,5,B001B18770,"This DVD was the best of Lee Strobel's cinematic efforts to date.  It covers the difficult-to-articulate subject of FAITH.  For those of us who are believer's, we know faith is a gift from God, and cannot be obtained through works, through mere intellectual pursuit, through studying philosophy or science.  The makers of this film pace the viewer through well-reasoned and well-articulated explanations about Christian faith, how Christian faith is based on the person, Jesus Christ, and not a philosophy of living. The believer's hope is therefore rooted in a historical person, who suffered as we do, and is the only one qualified to rescue us from a world bent on self-destructive rebellion against the purposes of God.",1224288000,7,723,5.162393162393163

The ma then began to have doubts and eventually lost/walked away from his faith. Then it goes into many interviews with people, some famous, who share their insights on topics such as evil, hope, and other topics. Insightful, a heart-breaking story.
