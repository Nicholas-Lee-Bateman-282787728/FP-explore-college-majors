8079131,5,B000ARXFFA,"The life of Jesus Christ is an execellent
documentary on his life . This starts before he was born with Elizabeth meeting each other telling each other about their
lives. The disciples being called to be
to follow Jesus and teaching his word. The
ending is triffic it shows him after he had
risen from the dead.",1318982400,,311,4.473684210526316
8079132,4,B000ARXFFA,Just a word of caution. This is the same DVD set packaged together with another DVD set called The Jesus Film into a set called The Life of Jesus. The video and sound quality have been cleaned up here somewhat though - the original film series is old - so you may want to consider getting this one and The Jesus Film separately if you're interested in both.,1278028800,4,357,4.264705882352941
