As soon as I get some money I'm gonna buy a bunch of Slayers stuff. ^-^;; Anyway, Lina and the rest of the characters are totally hilarious. There are several curse words, and a couple jokes that may make some people uncomfortable, but other than that it's good, clean humor. I highly reccomend this extraordinary video!",977702400,,360,4.73015873015873

The English seiyuus aren't very good.. Poor Zel-san,  misunderstood in this video. Lina and Gourry don't exactly mix at first,  but she hasn't learned of the hikari no ken yet.. BUY IT! ^_^;",955756800,,357,4.393939393939394
