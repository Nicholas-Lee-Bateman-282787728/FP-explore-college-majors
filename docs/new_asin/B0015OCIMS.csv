I like the four parts that give a break so teachers can discuss the information with their class. I also find it interesting that this was done in the days before everyone relied on the internet for finding information. I actually divide my class in half for a research project each year. Half the class is permitted to use the internet , the other half is not. They go to the library and search through books, maps, etc. The children in the film also go to the Wildlife Refuges and talk to 'real' people and get to see the animals up close. Every class should have an opportunity to see this. I realize it's an older film but I think it is still a valuable teaching tool. It is also available on DVD and some libraries still have copies.",1463702400,,881,4.378048780487805
