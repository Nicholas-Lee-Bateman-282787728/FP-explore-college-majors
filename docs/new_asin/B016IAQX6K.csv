7473003,5,B016IAQX6K,"Always take the written word with a grain of salt, but when you look at someone telling their story, there is no hiding it. They were either brainwashed, or they actually saw what they are describing (or you can tell they are liars).

This was a great show, worth every penny.

To boot, the investigative angle is getting to be more than just an AA meeting gone on too long, they are putting credible people up there on the podium who are reliable witnesses, usually retired.

Have fun watching..",1273190400,3,496,4.550561797752809
7473004,5,B016IAQX6K,"Having seen nearly every video clip and documentary of UFOs ever released, I can say without a doubt that this is the best one ever produced.  The content sticks to FACTS, and offers no speculation.  The persons interviewed are the most credible witnesses available, all of whom are respected professionals, ranging from astronauts to government officials.  What's more, ""I Know What I Saw"" has been produced in very high quality by an accomplished filmmaker.  This is a thorough investigation that stays on topic, lays all of the facts on the table, and challenges the public to acknowledge the documented truth.  It is easily the best UFO documentary ever made, chock-full of damning proof.  Mr. Fox has done an excellent job of bringing this important issue out into the open, paving the way for official disclosure... which has already begun.  You will not be disappointed with this film!",1273190400,3,892,5.0272108843537415
7473005,5,B016IAQX6K,"I too saw this on the History Channel and a must say I have never been more impressed with any other presentation on the subject of UFO's. I am open minded but highly skeptical and I believe this is the most convincing film I've ever seen. I wouldn't say I'm a ""believer"" now, but I'm closer than I've ever been. It is an extremely intelligent and objective documentary style film with the most credible testimony and witnesses you've ever seen....definitely worth the purchase if you have any interest in the subject matter at all.",1267315200,8,532,4.670212765957447
7473006,5,B016IAQX6K,"This film is made so well because it highlights the best cases, and presents solid facts and information leaving the viewer with a clear path to decide whether the UFO issue is real or not. Fox shows people on the street saying that people who see flying saucers or UFO's are all crazy, then goes on to show some respectful, professionals, pilots, military personnel, even a governer, who have compelling tales.
I saw this documentary late at night, and it scared me because of the potential of what they are uncovering. Weird stories of huge (sometimes a mile long) UFO's seen in many places of the world.
If you don't believe in UFO's watch this video. I am not sure anyone can view this and come away saying it's all in a person's mind or just made up. Scary and very well made. Highest recommendation.",1262649600,117,805,4.558620689655172

7473009,5,B016IAQX6K,"Having already viewed a pre-version of this film on the History Channel, I congratulate Mr. Fox on a fine investigative effort. The presentation is a low-key, precise documentation concerning individual experiences of encounters with unidentified flying objects. Most opinions are expressed by thoughtful professionals in a direct, easy to understand manner. ""I Know What I Saw"" is quite possibly the BEST film to date regarding it's intriguing, elusive subject. I really enjoyed it! Thank you James Fox, for making this movie.",1258502400,60,527,5.518518518518518
7473010,4,B016IAQX6K,"Alot of the same material and format as ""Out of the Blue"".  Other than that, well made.  Very surprised to see/hear the bonus interview with Dr, Hynek, and his answer (which I believe to be truthful even by his standards) to the question ""Are we alone?""  The material in this documentary is just enough to get you really thinking, but as usual never enough to prove the issue.  More circumstantial evidence.  But GOOD circumstantial evidence.  Tantallizing.  Must have for anyone researching this ever elusive subject.",1499817600,,518,5.023529411764706

7473032,4,B016IAQX6K,"Done by the same producer as ""Secret Access: Most Credible UFOs"", this documentary is more credible than the usual dismal fare of this genre. The civilian and military sources used for both documentaries are VERY compelling in their veracity; none of them appear to be in this for the notoriety and 15-minutes of fame.

I don't hand out compliments on videos too often, but this one deserves 6 stars in my opinion, unfortunately this scale only goes to 5 stars. If you only have time to watch one UFO documentary in your lifetime, I would recommend that this be the one you watch.",1447977600,,427,4.487179487179487
7473035,5,B016IAQX6K,"Highly recommend this heavily fact-based documentary. It's very enlightening, a little bit frightening and just plain fun. Everyone has seen something unexplainable at some point in their lives if they have spent any time outdoors--my husband and I both have. We are firm believer's, and this video, filled with credible witness accounts, underscores how widespread the UFO phenomenon really is. As ardent fans of the shows Ancient Aliens, Evidence, etc. we already believed, but it is a little scary to be shown the vast scope of the sightings, which is illustrated in this documentary. It's one thing to laugh and believe, but another to actually have those suspicions confirmed by such distinguished, reputable and professional people. If an astronaut like Gordon Cooper tells you there are UFO's NOT from this world, we believe it.

Having watched both ""Out of the Blue"" and ""I Know What I Saw"", we have to say the latter is a tighter film, but we enjoyed both of Mr. Fox's documentaries. ""Out of the Blue"" had information in it we had not seen before, and it's pretty darned engrossing. We also loved the second DVD disc included in ""Out of the Blue"", which carried more in-depth coverage of the Disclosure Press Conference--I believe it showed most of it.

Again, would highly recommend everyone watch this film. We purchased several copies and passed them to friends and family. Even those who first considered the subject ""woo-woo"" ended up believers, or at least more open-minded. The UFO subject has definitely moved from fringe to mainstream these past few decades, but how can it not, when people in Phoenix saw a mile-long object, which made no sound, pass slowly over their heads? Flares...right, lol....

7473072,5,B016IAQX6K,"This is the follow on program to James Fox's ""Out of the Blue"". Sort of an updated version incorporating information regarding a rash of recent sightings that occurred just after the release of OoB. It is not all new material, but mostly new material. The production values have improved since the OoB, because of its success. The big scoop with this show is Gov. Symington going on camera to reveal that he too had seen the mighty triangle over Phoenix. That really is a big deal. Fox got it. Additional good interviews with key players concerning Rendlesham Forest. There is the interview with Parviz Jafari - another huge scoop, because there is documentary evidence that the CIA was very interested in this case and had their contacts in Iran forward all the data to them for review. Good stuff on the Belgian flap - that has been well covered before, and an interview with pilot Ray Bowyer of the recent and now famous Channel Islands sighting. There is also a bit of the relatively recent Stephenville sighting, but not enough. Some of the key players spend little or no time on camera. This was a lost opportunity.  My chief criticism of the program is that it was probably rushed to market to capitalize on the notoriety of some of these recent sightings, which got quite a lot of press. He could have gone into more detail with these recent sightings, more in depth interviews and more of them - then, while spending time doing these sightings justice, he might have been in a position to do - or attempt to do some coverage regarding the O'Hare airport sighting.

7473076,4,B016IAQX6K,"James Fox assembled a goodly number of authoritative UFO eyewitnesses for a meeting at the National Press Club, ranging in status from retired USAF sergeants to retired generals, commercial airline pilots, and retired high-echelon politicians.  It's hard to argue with these guys because they've all been personally involved in the nebulous issue of Unidentified Flying Objects.

The documentary isn't organized historically.  Instead, one by one, half a dozen or so speakers at the meeting describe their experiences.  Each presentation is accompanied by documents, artistic reconstructions of the event, or the recorded conversations of pilots and ATCs.  Participants include speakers from America, France, Belgium, Chile, and the UK.

But the program often takes us outside the Press Club for interviews with witnesses in places like rural Texas and urban Arizona.  Jimmy Carter has a few remarks and so does Gordon Cooper, last man to orbit the earth alone.  Most of them have ideas about what they've seen but, of course, nobody can be certain.

What surprised me as much as anything else is the amount of material that's new.  Many of us know about the sighting at the American Air Force base near Rendelsham, but the sergeant in charge of the first night's investigation (there were sightings on two nights) has his original note book and shows it to Fox.  I mean, we see his handwriting and drawings -- done on the spot.  He actually touched the object.  And when it took off, his handwritten note reads ""IMPOSSIBLE!"" and is underlined several times.  In case you don't trust sergeants leading a security team, the next night a colonel was involved and saw what appeared to be the same object.  Colonels are intrinsically more credible, right?

Most objections to UFO sightings are reasoned roughly in accordance with David Hume's observations on judging miracles.

""When anyone tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should have really happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other; and according to the superiority, which I discover, I pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater miracle.""

Hume, of course, is right but science is no longer in the business of judging miracles.  It would have been a miracle in 1720 if stones fell from the sky.  (Nowadays we call them meteorites.)  The likelihood of an event is now expressed in probabilities.  There's no such thing as certainty.  (Will the sun rise tomorrow?  The only correct answer is ""probably"".)  The probability of objects darting about the sky and doing things that no device on earth can do is very low.  But even lower is the probability of an increasing number of reliable, sane, and terribly vulnerable people putting their dignity and their careers on the line.  The United States, by the way, is the only industrialized country that officially denies any interest in the UFO phenomenon, although sub rosa inquiries apparently are going on all the time.

I wish James Fox didn't appear so often on camera.  It leaves behind the slightly sour taste of narcissism.  Michael Moore sometimes seems a little too eager to have his picture taken too.  I applaud their work, in both cases, but we really shouldn't see more of our host than of any other participant.  Even Jacques Cousteau gave us whales without showing off.",1340064000,6,3474,5.008726003490401

I also have ""Phoenix Lights"", and some reviewers compared the two and found ""I Know What I Saw"" better.  But my own view is that you can't compare the two - they are very different - one is about the Phoenix Lights sighting in particular (excellent! 5-star), and I Know What I Saw covers the best UFO sightings: mass Belgian sighting, UFO craft on a military base, pilot captains witnessing cigar-shaped lights (and radar to prove it), Stephenville TX siting in which the whole town saw a V-shaped object, French government 3-year study on UFOs and claiming the best explanation is ""outside our earth"", and many more really fascinating incidents which I can't go into any detail here.

That was a real eye opener especially because he produces ALL the evidence he copied before the CIA confiscated it.

The format is simple. The producers find all kinds of credible witnesses from all over the world, most of which are in high ranking or prestigious positions, such as astronaut Gordon Cooper, and let them tell their stories. And these aren't ""I saw a light in the night sky"" kinds of stories either. Some, like in the Rendlesham Forest incident, where the U.S. base commander walked under the craft and touched it, are too real to ignore. Most of those interviewed in this documentary were gathered for a symposium at the National Press Club where they were able to present their stories with whatever backup evidence they had, and there is simply no reason to disbelieve these people. They are as credible as they come.

James Fox is the host and director and he does a fine job of arranging everything. The DVD is dotted with great photos and footage of various sightings, including the one seen over Phoenix Arizona which lasted a long time and was witnessed by thousands. The production values are of high level. The photography and sound are of a quality that does not distract the viewer form the content.

As you view this DVD and see the integrity of the various presenters and then hear how the detractors try to explain it away, you get to realize how silly the detractors sound. This is really a 4 and a half star job. The only kind of stupid part was where a witness copied glyphs he saw on the side of a UFO. James Fox took them to a mathematician to see if he could make anything of them. Why a mathematician? Why not someone who deals in glyphs or some other discipline? This was the only wasted scene in the documentary.

7473094,5,B016IAQX6K,"This, James Fox's second documentary film focusing on the evidence for the UFO phenomenon and the official cover-up, is so good it's hard to fault.

The film's main focus is the November 2007 press conference held at the National Press Club in Washington DC organised by Fox and Leslie Kean, founder of the Coalition for Freedom of Information. At this press conference air force generals, military and civilian pilots and high-ranking officers from around the world presented details of their encounters with UFOs during the course of their duties to the world's press. Each of the stories documented by these credible witnesses gets a few minutes of screen time, interspersed with interviews of other witnesses to other hard-evidence cases. Fife Symingon, the Governor of Arizona who lost credibility with so many following his Martian-in-a-prosthetic-suit stunt, put himself on the line to chair the DC event in front of the world's press and regained substantial respect and credibility as a result.

Many witnesses to the extraordinary giant craft over Stephenville TX and Phoenix AZ variously described as larger than ""A flying aircraft carrier"" and ""a flying Wall-Mart"" are interviewed and go on the record. All these people are not deluded: they saw something, and they know what they saw was not swamp gas, or the planet Venus, or a weather balloon. They come over as obviously insulted by such weak and ridiculous suggestions and don't understand why they are given no answers by the authorities.

The message of ""I Know What I Saw"" is, in summary:

1. Highly credible, professionally qualified, intelligent and conservative-minded individuals - civilian and military pilots, high-ranking military officers, astrophysicists from around the world - have seen and interacted with truly extraordinary aerial objects multiply witnessed, tracked on radar, real physical craft under obviously intelligent control. Some have been directed to intercept the intruders with almost catastrophic consequences to themselves and their aircraft

2. The phenomenon is obviously real, and advanced technology of non-human manufacture is the most plausible explanation for all these encounters

3. There is a conspiracy of silence, a cover-up, managed from somewhere deep in government or above/outside government control who do not want the public to be informed of the truth of the issue - for whatever reasons

4. People need to take this seriously: it's important, and time to act

The film's only weakness (if it can be so called) is that a small amount of the material from Fox's previous film on the subject, ""Out of the Blue"", is re-used in IKWIS. 98% of the running footage however is new, and truly excellent.

This is definitely a film to be shown to skeptics, or to those largely ignorant of the phenomenon and its pervasive nature. The evidence is very compelling, and cannot be lightly dismissed by anyone with average intelligence and critical reasoning abilities.",1278806400,32,2971,5.264270613107822

""I Know What I Saw"" is a documentary that premiered on the History channel that takes the most credible UFO witnesses they could find from around the world and interviews them and looks at their evidence. It was written and directed by James Fox.

In this field, it IS disappointing that 95% of UFO stories we hear come from sources like a one-toothed guy named Bubba that lives out in a field with a thick redneck accent and low hygiene. It is very easy to dismiss these cases as crazy people, drunk people, or hallucinations. But what about that other 5%? What about more credible witnesses?

It turns out there are several people out there who have had UFO experiences while on the job like in the Air Force. There are doctors, professors, and even some politicians who finally admit to having seen something that could not be explained and having proof to back it up. Some years ago, there was a summit in Washington, D.C. for all these credible witnesses from branches of the military, astronauts, the government, and pilots to come together and share their stories in an atmosphere where they would not be ridiculed in order to bring more attention to the phenomenon in hopes of opening up a new investigation into the existence of UFOs.

The Air Force used to be in charge of investigating these claims. They had a team called Project Blue Book and part of its job was to downplay any stories so not to ""alarm"" the public. Explanations were thrown out right and left about flares, weather balloons, and toxic gas whether they were true or not. Eventually the project was shut down and no official investigations were to take place anymore.

The biggest message of this documentary is asking the question, ""Why can't the U.S. work with other countries and compare notes to try and find answers once and for all? What's the harm?"" Different stories have taken place all around the world and the degree of denial and the jokes prohibit any actual research from taking place. Sure, there are many problems in this country more worth paying attention to, but the people really do want to know. Polls suggest many people believe in UFOs or would like to so there would be many ears willing to listen if anything were found.

In judging this documentary, there is no doubt that 95% of this elite group of credible people are very genuine and hard to doubt. Even more so when they bring proof of their aircraft's reports showing something being there that isn't supposed to be. The sketches, notes, and tape recorded panicked voices are a little easier to disprove if one wished, but those maps and sensors wouldn't lie. This documentary is a nice exploration into a topic many people wonder about so if you're into UFOs, you'll want to check this one out.
