8575977,1,B00BZW5XUE,This actually gets zero stars. This a the worst purchase I have ever made! It's like watching an A.V. club project from high school. YouTube videos pieces together with narration. Biggest waste of money!,1406592000,,203,5.0

8575979,1,B00BZW5XUE,"Just gave this to my daughter for christmas she is a huge mumford and sons fan . we have just realized its an unauthorised copy of a few interviews that can all be seen on youtube for free . DO NOT BUY THIS There is no music here at all . so sad to see my young daughter go from exited to think she had something new  from her favourite band to almost tears of disapointment its a poor quality cracly voice over with the video appearing in a small box in the screen
if mumford and sons knew thier loyal fans were being acammed with this they would be very disapointed .",1387929600,3,569,4.035398230088496
8575980,5,B00BZW5XUE,"Absolutely loved this DVD to add to my cherished collection.  I am a HUGE Mumford and Sons fan and yes, some of the clips, I had seen before but many I had not.  It was great to see them all together one right after another on my huge TV screen.  Only thing was female narrator was a little irritating, would rather of heard a guy's voice and she kept mispronouncing Babel many times throughout the DVD.  To me, anything that has Marcus Mumford in it, I absolutely adore and will give 5 stars to any time!!!",1381622400,,507,4.25
8575981,2,B00BZW5XUE,"The interviews with the band members were great, however I feel that the whole dvd (less the actual interviews) was dull :( It's doesn't take away from my love of the band though!",1375142400,7,179,4.454545454545454
8575982,4,B00BZW5XUE,"I like it but, wish they had included some of the songs alongwith the dialoge. It is kind of boring after awhile with just alking.",1371859200,5,130,4.24
8575983,1,B00BZW5XUE,"This DVD is awful and a complete waste of money.  It sounds like a boring narrative of the Wikipedia page that you can find online.  It has a few interviews sliced together that you can find on YouTube. Don't waste your time or money!  I wish I could return it and get a refund.  If you want to watch a good DVD of Mumford & Sons, the best I have seen is The Road to Red Rocks.
Really disappointing.",1371254400,17,399,4.012658227848101
