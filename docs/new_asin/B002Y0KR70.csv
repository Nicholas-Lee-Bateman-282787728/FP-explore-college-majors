VIDEO & AUDIO:

When I first saw ""Dragon Ball"", it was probably back in 1992 and the quality of this raw Japanese video was so rough and hard to watch, it was just bad. Several years later, I was able to catch the first few episodes that aired on television but the problem was that the schedule was inconsistent and our television network was quite bad.

So, it is great to see this uncut, remastered and digitally restored version on DVD. Presented in its original format of 4:3, one thing I noticed is how good this anime series looked on DVD. The series is nearly 25 years old and just watching it, FUNimation Entertainment did a great job in bringing this series out and making it look very good.  Granted, it is not free of blemishes, there is some dust, you will see a bit of compression but for the most part, compared to what we had available years ago or over a decade ago, I'm quite content with this remastered version of the series.

As for the audio, similar to the recent FUNimation Entertainment ""Dragon Ball Z"" and ""Dragon Ball GT"" releases, the English voice track with original Japanese music comes in 5.1 Surround, while the Japanese voice track is in its original Japanese mono. I watched both English and Japanese and of course, there are some changes in the English dialogue (ie. Master Roshi and in the Japanese track, Kamesama Sennen) and grew up watching the original Japanese version but for the most part, I have enjoyed the ""Dragon Ball Z"" and ""Dragon Ball GT"" dubwork and similar to those two series, I found th English dubwork for ""Dragon Ball"" to be quite solid. Dialogue is clear and understandable and for audio settings, for both audio tracks, I found the best setting for me was to select on my receiver ""Stereo on all Channels"".

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Dragon Ball - Season Three"" comes with the textless opening and closing theme songs and FUNimation Entertainment trailers plus a 24-page booklet with character information and episode synopsis.

JUDGMENT CALL:

So, far this latest volume of ""Dragon Ball"" is my favorite yet.  For ""Dragon Ball Z"" fans who enjoyed more action-oriented storylines, this volume is definitely action-driven.

Also, we get a glimpse of situations that become important in the ""Dragon Ball Z"" storyline such as Goku getting acquainted with Korin and Goku having his first sensu bean.  Also, plenty of battles with Goku taking on Mercenary Tao, the Red Ribbon Army and also the World Martial Arts Tournament where we get to see future Z-warriors Tien and Chiaotzu.

There really is nothing negative that can be said about this latest volume.  If you are a ""Dragon Ball"" fan, it's simply a must buy.  This is the best release I have seen of the anime series thus far in the US and the fact that you are getting over 30 episodes in one set is an amazing deal.

And if you have collected the first two seasons, it just gets better from there and expect about two more volumes of ""Dragon Ball"", just in time as FUNimation Entertainment prepares its HD release of ""Dragon Ball Z Kai"" (note: ""Dragon Ball Z"" is currently available, also in its uncut Japanese version featured in the ""Dragon Box"" DVD sets from FUNimation Entertainment"".  Hopefully, we will see a re-release or maybe a Blu-ray release of the ""Dragon Ball"" films.

Overall, ""Dragon Ball - Season Three"" is another awesome volume for the series and its literally a series that gets better and better.  Definitely recommended!",1268179200,6,7534,4.471670345842531
4011213,5,B002Y0KR70,"I have always loved Dragonball Z since it debuted in America in 1996.  I own every episode and have watched the series beginning to end more times than I can count.  The crazy thing is I never watched Dragonball until now in 2010.  I absolutely love it.  I bought the season 1, 2, and 3 box sets and I am addicted to it.  It changes the way I look at DBZ, I love them both.  My only problem is waiting for the last 2 box sets.  I wish I became a fan later this year :).  I could watch it on the net but waiting 2-3 months will make it an even greater treat and my anticipation will be through the roof.  I love the Japanese music they have, its different than the American music in that there are a lot more quiet scenes in DB than the Faulconer dub of DBZ.  In the BF DBZ dub they play music for everything in this there are more quiet scenes.  Its great!",1266105600,12,856,3.9473684210526314
4011214,5,B002Y0KR70,"I already saw these episodes from the discontinued set. I'm waiting for two Piccolo arcs to drop before I buy any of these though since those are the stories I left off on. This series is great though, IMHO Dragon Ball is better than Dragon Ball Z. It has a better story and features actual adventure not just happenings that revolve around one major boss fight.

Anyway, I truly recommend this series to anyone that likes the fights of Dragon Ball but wish the character development and story was better.",1265068800,,505,4.611111111111111
4011215,5,B002Y0KR70,So I did some shopping around....and DVD Empire is only charging 34.99 with free shipping...now Amazon usually does a pretty good job on competing as far as prices I have not been disappointed yet...until now...hopefully some of the fine folks at Amazon will read this and drop the price.,1263340800,,288,4.8979591836734695
4011216,5,B002Y0KR70,"Dragon Ball is an amazing series. While Dragon Ball Z is the more famous anime series because of all its super battles, Dragon Ball is actually a little bit more enjoyable because of its light-hearted humor mixed with more traditional fight scenes. With Dragon Ball FUNimation is releasing the series in an amazing and affordable format. These releases are much better handled than the Dragon Ball Z releases being that they are not cropped and the original opening and closing themes are sung in English! If you're a fan of the Dragon Ball manga or Dragon Ball Z, then I truly suggest you get Dragon Ball. With a release of 30-31 episodes a season this volume is the midway point of the series.

Volume 1: Episodes 1-31 (31 episodes) Pilaf Saga -> Training/1st Tournament Saga -> Start of Red Ribbon Army Saga

Volume 2: Episodes 32-61 (30 episodes) Continuation of Red Ribbon Army Saga

The following are pure speculation and often FUNimation makes wacky choices when they divided their seasons, but if they had any sense volumes 4 & 5 should be the way I list it here as it would complete two sagas with their respective season releases.

Volume 3: Episodes 62-92 (31 episodes) End of Red Ribbon Army Saga -> The Complete Fortuneteller Baba Saga -> Start of Tien Shinhan/2nd Tournament Saga

62  ""Sacred Water""
63  ""The Return of Goku""
64  ""The Last of Mercenary Tao""
65  ""Confront the Red Ribbon Army""
66  ""A Real Bind""
67  ""The End of Commander Red ""
68  ""The Last Dragon Ball""
69  ""Who is Fortuneteller Baba?""
70  ""We Are The Five Warriors""
71  ""Deadly Battle""
72  ""Goku's Turn to Fight""
73  ""The Devilmite Beam""
74  ""The Mysterious Fifth Man""
75  ""The Strong Ones""
76  ""The True Colors of the Masked Man""
77  ""Pilaf's Tactics""
78  ""The Eternal Dragon Rises""
79  ""Terror and Plague""
80  ""Goku vs. Sky Dragon""
81  ""Goku Goes to Demon Land""
82  ""The Rampage of InoShikaCho""
83  ""Which Way To Papaya Island? ""
84  ""Rivals and Arrivals""
85  ""Preliminary Peril""
86  ""Then There Were Eight""
87  ""Yamcha vs. Tien""
88  ""Yamcha's Big Break""
89  ""Full-Moon Vengeance""
90  ""The Dodon Wave""
91  ""Counting Controversy!""
92  ""Goku Enters the Ring""

Volume 4: Episodes 93-122 (30 episodes) The End of Tien Shinhan/2nd Tournament Saga -> The Complete Demon King Piccolo Saga

Volume 5: 123-153 (31 episodes) The Complete Piccolo Jr. Saga/3rd Tournament Saga -> End of Dragon Ball",1259798400,47,2369,4.72972972972973
4011217,5,B002Y0KR70,This should really be the bases for all tv shows on dvd. Keep relasing them every 2-3 months. Its just great. I love dragonball. Its sooooo funny and while it not as big on action a like dragonball z (yet) its still a better show. I love dragonball 10 out of 10 and DBZ 9.0 out of 10.  Season 3 finishes of the red ribbion army and its really good show. I highly recommond it.,1259366400,7,376,4.013333333333334

4011220,4,B002Y0KR70,"My kid and I love this series, but the need to push them into 30ish episode seasons is really a detriment. This one cuts off in the middle of the tournament. Just so weird.

That aside, the Red Ribbon Saga wraps up, some training filler, and the beginning of the next world tournament. Then it cuts off right in the middle of the tournament. Pretty great season, but a bit scattered in the middle. The introduction of Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, and the Crane School added a great dynamic. A fun season overall.

Once again, the black character named Black is hard to watch. Sooo racist. Very painful regardless of cultural context.",1515369600,,628,4.648648648648648

The final disc came manufactured with a streak on it that prevented playback of the disc entirely. I found this out just now as I got to that disc while marathoning the series for exercise sessions, and I had to look for alternative methods to continue watching the product I bought, which were less than ideal. This is review is left so people can be aware if this is a larger issue to look out for it, especially Funimation, as it seems to be a production problem with the discs, there was nothing in the packaging to cause this.",1495584000,,672,4.384

I really like the booklet the DVD'S are inserted in and the slip cover is very nice as well. The audio is really good. I definitely recommend Dragon Ball to anyone whether you are new to anime or not. I've got to say this is a great gateway in order to get into other anime's. Great blend of action and comedy.

4011346,5,B002Y0KR70,"This is a great purchase! I won't go about reviewing the series so much since this is the third installment of a DB season disc set but I will review the product. :)

The animation/sound on this is really good for the age. The remastering quality doesn't hurt the image noticeably (since that seems to be an issue on the Orange Bricks), and there isn't any cropping. The sound is as good as you can probably get. The English is on the 5.1 surround sound track and the Japanese comes in mono. Unfortunately you can't really get the surround sound audio for the Japanese since the anime is so old.

The discs come with 6/7 episodes each and provide a play all and a marathon feature. Play all includes openings/endings while marathon does not. The packaging on the disc set isn't amazing but it's still pretty good. The logo on the slip cover is in raised lettering and gives it a nice look. However, the slip cover is so tight that it's hard to put it on super easily without foxing the edges. on either the dvd case or the slip cover. (Both of which aren't super sturdy so don't go tossing this around too much). There's no episode guide or booklet inside since the company went green too, so you'll have to guess the episodes out disc by disc if you don't remember what happens in each specific episode number.

Then shipping was great. :) I got the free shipping option with the 5-8 days and it came on the 8th day but I was happy with it. It came in a bubble wrap packing envelope since it was shipping in single. I'm really happy and I totally suggest it! It's just about the only way to own Dragon Ball, (literally).",1421107200,,1621,4.360927152317881

Just disappointed that it did not come with the booklet, like seasons 1 and 2 did. Upon further investigation it seems this error was intentional.

4011387,4,B002Y0KR70,"This DVD set was awesome.  I also have Season 2 of DragonBall, and some DVDs for DragonBall Z.  Season 2 was awesome as it shows the totally awesome villainous organization known as the Red Ribbon Army.  It had an interesting story of searching a pirate cave for the DragonBall.  But, since Season 2 did not end after Goku defeats the Red Ribbon Army or the end of the Red Ribbon Army saga.  You need the first disk of Season 3 for that which I bought Season 3.  They possibly ended the DVDs in the middle of a storyline/saga to encourage you to get the next one. The confrontation Goku has between the Red Ribbon Army headquarters was amazing.  It was totally action packed and it takes your breath away.  The end of Season 3 is at the tournament where you're anxious to see the face-off between Goku and Tien.  I have to give it 4 stars, because although I love Dragon Ball, I'm more of a fan of the later series Dragon Ball Z.  Probably because of the graphics and music in the latter series.

4011409,3,B002Y0KR70,"Well here we are; my least favorite of all the seasons.  That horrible plotline I've been going on about?  It continues with the first 3 episodes on here, where Goku gets the mystical water, becomes stronger & beats Mercenary Tao.  These episodes are good, apart from a scene in the last one which features a random flashback to Bulma's flash. 0_0  *sigh*  Just when you think the series is safe enough to watch around other people...

The quality does return for the next 3.5 episodes as Goku flies off to face the Red Ribbon Army.  These action-packed episodes are the best ones on the set.  But when the smoke from the final explosion clears it begins.  They can't find the last Dragonball!  So Master Roshi takes them to Fortuneteller Baba.  She can tell them anything, if they either pay 10,000 zenny or fight her five warriors; and since none of the main characters are that rich, that's right, it's 5 lame fights!  I couldn't believe it when I was watching this.  I'm a patient man (you'd have to be to enjoy DBZ, even the Kai cut), but all throughout here I was thinking ""Hurry up & beat them, this is stupid!""  Our heroes must face terrifying monsters like Fangs the Vampire, See Through the Invisible Man, Bandages the Mummy; what a lame-o line-up!  These monsters are so stupid they bring back memories of Beetleborgs.  The last fight, while not as bad is still weak (at least 1 episode's worth of footage consisting of nothing but Goku being banged on the ground by his tail like the cats in Monty Python & the Holy Grail!), but it ends with a heartwarming moment in which Goku meets his grandfather Gohan one last time; the only good part of this saga.  Then it's revealed that Pilaf has the last Dragonball in a box that keeps it from being detected, so off Goku goes & it takes an episode to beat him, thanks to his admittedly somewhat cool mecha, & then an episode to revive Bora, & then that's it!  It's over!  I'll never watch it again as long as I live!  I know this is sacrilege, but I really like Dragonball GT, & while it had a couple stupid episodes here & there, they never went on as long as this did.  It's stupid, felt completely unnecessary, & featured a return to what put me off of the series to start with!

But after that, there are some good filler episodes that took the taste out of my mouth.  My favorites were the one with Skydragon (A character so cool he got a cameo in the 9th DBZ movie) & the one that introduced Tien & Chiatzou.  But then the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament Saga begins, & the episodes become great again, & hopefully stay that way until the end of the series.  But anyways, this really is a great saga.  It was interesting to see just how bad Tien, one of my favorite character on Z, was before Goku got to him.  Also, Yamcha's defeat at Tien's hands isn't as embarrassing as Roshi I mean Jackie Chun beating him in the previous tournament.

So since no one warned me about the nudity in this season, I'm going to warn you about it.  While the 2nd season was mostly free of nudity apart from a couple instances on Goku's part & some dirty magazines, this set features a return to what I didn't like about the first season.  The End of Mercenary Tao features Goku dreaming about the time Bulma got the Dragonball from Master Roshi, & his part in that mess.  In episode 65, Roshi uses Bulma's flying camera to watch a woman undress, but then it turns out to be a man, which causes him to throw up (not onscreen though).  The Fortuneteller Baba Saga had the worst though.  In in episode 72, to beat the invisible man, Krillin pulls down Bulma's top in front of Roshi, & the resulting nose bleed covers the monster.  Also, more annoying nudity from Goku as Pilaf burns his pants off, & unfazed he beats him half naked.  The worst was when we get a frontal close up of Goku just before he pees.  But if you can get through all this, the last episodes on the set as well as all of next season feature none of this.  So there you have it.  You'll have to get it for completion's sake, just don't expect to be entertained throughout all of it.  But really, it is worth it for the good episodes.",1364688000,,4149,4.352864583333333

4011440,4,B002Y0KR70,"The Dragon Ball Season Three DVD box set includes five DVDs that contain thirty-one episodes.  The first four discs contain seven episodes, and the fifth disc contains three episodes and the DVD extras.  The focus of this set is Goku completing his quest for the Dragon Balls and fulfilling his promise to Oopa, some episodes showing some of Goku's training over a three year period, and the early rounds of the next Tenkaichi Tournament.

On the main menu of the first four discs, you can choose to watch all the episodes, watch the disc with the marathon feature, choose which episode you want to watch, and set up your language and subtitle options.  One of the best features of this set is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.  However, with the marathon feature, you only see the opening credits once, and the ending credits are not shown.  This feature is very helpful when you're trying to watch all of the episodes on a disc in a single sitting.  In the setup menu, you can choose between English and Japanese audio.  You can also choose to turn the subtitles on and off.

The menu on the fifth DVD adds in a link for the special features.  However, the features aren't very special.  All you get are the textless versions of the opening and ending credits (which are the same as what appeared on the first two DVD box sets), and trailers.  The trailers included on this set are for Dragon Ball Z, D.Gray-man, Evangelion 1.11, Kenichi, One Piece, Slayers Revolution, Nabari no Ou, and Dragon Ball.

Overall, the episodes that appeared in this box set are better than what was included on the second season box set.  My biggest disappointment with this set was how FUNimation decided to split the episodes between discs.  Instead of trying to divide the episodes out a little more evenly between discs, they decided to cram as many episodes as they could on the early discs in the set, and only placing three measly episodes on the final disc.

While I'm a little disappointed by the episode breakdown of the discs and by the lack of special features, this set is still a ""must get"" for any Dragon Ball fans that want to own the series on DVD.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1297728000,,2307,4.574209245742092
4011441,5,B002Y0KR70,"As Goku inches closer to defeating the Red Ribbon Army, one thing is for sure. He must keep his promise to his new friend Upa and bring his father back from the dead with the Dragon Balls.

The saga of Dragon Ball keeps getting better with every new adventure as the sagas keep going.  I had stated before in the first season review, that what I love the most about this series is that I am finally seeing how everything came together when Dragon Ball Z began. Season Three introduces us to a bunch of familiar faces, such as the crafty demigod Korin, and Master Roshi's older sister, Fortune Teller Baba. Season three gives me two things that I was so eager to finally see. One was Goku's encounter with Mercenary Tao, the ruthless killer for hire that was normally seen in DBZ flashbacks. After that the thing I did not see coming was the link that Tao has to Tien Shinhan who also makes his first apperiance with his friend Chiaotzu. It was so strange to actually see Tien as a villain in Dragon Ball so I am very eager to see exactly when he changes from foe to friend.

So strap yourself in and get your seat for the tournament because Goku is on his way back in full force with a new bunch of entertaining adventures!",1291334400,,1223,4.331877729257642

4011444,4,B002Y0KR70,"Dragon Ball Season 3 features the last episodes of the Red Ribbon Army saga, the complete Baba Saga, and the beginning of the twenty second world tournament also known as the Tienshinhan Saga.

For starters we finally get to see Goku complete his training atop Korin's tower and get his rematch with Tao. The second round between the two is the best fight to date, but it will be outdone even by the end of this set. Things finally start to get better from here.

After apparently killing Tao and getting his revenge for Bora's death, Goku decides to take the battle right to the Red Ribbon army. Roshi, Krillin, and Yamcha try to join in, but the battle is over by the time they arrive. Goku single-handedly takes out every single member of the army with no help at all. He doesn't even have any trouble until he runs into Assistant Black, but even then Black is no real challenge for Goku. Even with the aid of a rather robust looking mecha suit, Black is simply no match for Goku. Finally the monolithic ship that was the Red Ribbon Army saga has sunk and we can put it behind us.

But with the death of Bora Goku finds renewed vigor for hunting for the dragon balls. Aided by his friends and the young Upa, the team sets out to find all seven balls so they can restore the life of Upa's father Bora. However the dragon radar has broken. With no alternative, the team visits Roshi's sister, the fortune teller Baba. However the old witch isn't willing to help the kids unless they prove themselves by completing her tournament. Baba's fighters are largely unimpressive. First there's a vampire, who actually manage to defeat Krillin but is then beaten by the tag team of Puar and Upa (yeah, picture that one!). The second opponent is an invisible fighter who, once made visible, is incredibly easy for Yamcha to defeat. In the third battle Yamcha loses to a Mummy as they fight in a giant toilet bowl (yup) and Goku jumps in and defeats the monster with a single blow. A devil man appears for the next battle and uses a special attack that turns a person's evil thoughts into lethal energy, but Goku has no evil thoughts so the beam does no harm to him, and Goku wins again.

Yeah, sounds like a yawn fest so far, right? Well things finally pick up in the main event when a masked fighter trounces Goku and reveals himself to be none other than Grandpa Gohan, come back to life for a day so he can test Goku's abilities. After a touching scene where Goku is reunited with his Grandpa, Baba finally decides to help the group. She uses her crystal ball to find the last dragon ball. Goku proceeds to capture it but once again comes to face Emperor Pilaf. As usual Pilaf and his minions prove to be a complete waste of time as Goku plows right through them. With the final ball in hand Goku makes his whish and Bora's life is restored. When the dragon balls spiral into the air to scatter to the winds, Goku manages to jump up after them and catch his Grandpa's Dragon Ball so that he doesn't have to go hunting for it again.

A few unremarkable filler episodes take place while Goku travels the world to train for the upcoming tournament. Along the way he runs into Tien and Chiaotzu, two villainous martial artists using their pet Inoshikocho to scam local villagers. A brief scuffle reveals Tien to be quite powerful, but is inconclusive. Eventually the twenty second world martial arts tournament begins, and things really heat up.

This tournament focuses on the rivalry between Roshi's Turtle school and Shen's Krane school. Roshi's students consist of Yamcha, Krillin, and Goku while Shen sends in Tien and Chiaotzu. The saga is not complete in this set, but the first round is there and features some excellent fights. The preliminaries feature some points of interest as well as Nam returns from the first tournament but is nearly killed by Tien. Goku goes on to defeat King Chappa, a martial artist who won the tournament before the year Goku competed without being struck once. However the former champ is no match for Goku.

The first round starts off with a kick as Yamcha has a terrific fight with Tien. The two fighters have been building up their rivalry since they met before the preliminaries and this battle is the ultimate culmination of that feud. Tien and Yamcha pull out some fantastic moves, while Yamcha performs his first Kamehameha wave, Tien easily turns it away. Roshi, as Jackie Chun, has a rather dull fight with a werewolf type character who's upset that Jackie destroyed the moon. The fight between Chiaotzu and Krillin is remarkable for being the only time that we get to actually see Chiaotzu fight, as well as being the moment that the viewers find out Mercenary Tao was actually Shen's brother and Tien's teacher. This makes the rivalry between the schools far more personal, and Tien is intent to kill Goku for revenge. The final episode is Goku's fight against a character named Pamput who's a martial arts actor. Needless to say that the fight is the least impressive throughout the entire tournament, including the preliminaries. What's worse is that the fight is dragged out with this needlessly long pre-fight event where Pamput's manager tries to distract Goku long enough for Pamput to get the win by default, which is botched by Launch.

But the battles will only get better from here. This season shows when the series really starts to catch it's stride and begins to evolve into the series it would eventually become. I highly recommend this box set. Despite the way the story starts to drag after the defeat of Mercenary Tao and until the start of the tournament, it's still an excellent buy. Well worth it for those fights alone. But more importantly, make sure you get the next one. It's even better!",1272931200,4,5751,4.614858260019551
4011445,5,B002Y0KR70,"Let me start off by saying this dvd box came extremely fast and in good condition. The end of the red ribbon army saga, fortune teller baba saga, and the beginning of the tien saga were all included. The quality is good and it brings back memories from watching this back in the day (90's). I recommend this to anyone because it will make you love DragonBall all over again if you already don't. 5 out of 5.",1270512000,,407,4.230769230769231
4011446,4,B002Y0KR70,"I have never been much of a fan of the DrabonBall series, probably since I had never sat down and watched it from the beginning. Always catching an episode here and there. But since my hubby is a huge Dragonball Z fan I got him the complete series and was persuaded to watch a couple of episodes. That's all it took! I was completely hooked!! I love the innocence and trusting nature of Goku. He brings a new was of looking at life that makes it fun!. Yes there is fighting but only fighting for the honor and justice not for the glorified violence that we see on tv today. I have no problem letting my kids watch as there are always morals involved. Great series. Can't wait to see what the rest will bring!",1268524800,,708,4.2518518518518515
