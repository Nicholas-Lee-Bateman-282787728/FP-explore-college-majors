3414318,2,B0018BEG5U,"I just did this video and was dissappointed and bored. Unfortunately this is a very slow beginning and the camera work needs help, since ofter she starts a new move, but the camera is off somewhere else and totally misses it. I love pilates and the firm so I had great hopes for it, but sadly it did not live up to them. I would recommend Windsor Pilates over this one any day. There was no challenge in this at all and definitely boring.",1240012800,,438,4.226190476190476
3414319,4,B0018BEG5U,"This workout is great for when you want to have a mellow workout day.
It's broken into 4 segments for a 50 minute total workout.  Standing warm-up/core work, mat upper body, mat lower body and mat core/cool down.  It definitely got my heart rate up and burned a suprising amout of calories (so says my heart rate monitor).  There are beginner modifcations as well as more advanced moves.  It encorporates a ""stretchy"" band for extra resistence and keeps it interesting.  The 50 minutes always flies by I  feel great after I've finished this workout.",1237593600,4,549,4.787234042553192
3414320,5,B0018BEG5U,I enjoyed this video as a change up from my usually high impact days.  It gave me a workout at a low impact and later my ab muscles were a little sore.  Would recommend for a light work out day.  Remember the point of these types of exercise is low impact and to lengthen and tone your body.,1228608000,3,291,3.9827586206896552
3414321,3,B0018BEG5U,"Sculpt-ilates is a 50-minute pilates sculpt workout.  I found it challenging, but not overly so.  There were no impossible Teasers or lengthy plank moves.  It was nice to have a workout that I could do in bare feet.  I didn't break a huge sweat, but now that I've finished, I feel great and my body feels stronger.  Definitely give this a try on a day when you want to work your body without having to huff and puff around the room.  The DVD came with an 84"", steel-gray Pilates band with the Gaiam name and logo printed on it.  You'll need a mat or carpet for the floor work.  Although the release date seems to be September 2008, I think it was filmed before the recent Firm releases, as it has the white-brick background, not the blue/gray set they're using these days.  Robyn Johnson is the lead, and her cueing is fine.  However, the camera doesn't always follow her properly.  Sometimes a new move is being demonstrated, but the camera misses it.  This also happens sometimes when castmember Kelsie Daniels is demonstrating the easier modification.  This minor problem can be solved by viewing the entire video before performing it yourself. Other castmember: Alison Davis.  Overall, I'm happy with this one.",1223510400,15,1214,4.719047619047619
3414322,4,B0018BEG5U,I like this dvd. The only problem is that it maybe too easy. I like easy workouts but this is too easy to even consider a workout. However it is effective it delivers as it promises.,1297814400,,182,4.083333333333333
3414323,1,B0018BEG5U,I would not suggest this DVD.  I am a HUGE firm believer and never have been disappointed in one of their videos.  This one is very slow and very beginner.  The only part of my body that I actually felt like I got a work out was my arms and that was only because of the resistance I chose with the band.  I have never done a Pilates workout for the first time and not felt it my core.  Very disappointing.,1294876800,,405,3.950617283950617
3414324,4,B0018BEG5U,Nice to have a twist on the classical Pilates Mat work using the band. Keeps in line with other The Firm DVDs in terms of pace and presentation which makes this more of a workout than a Pilates routine. Not a difficult routine but a nice change.,1293753600,,245,4.23404255319149
3414325,3,B0018BEG5U,"i feel bad writing this because i LOVE the firm workouts, but this one is not one of my favorites.  it never gets me into a good work-out.  i bought it thinking it would have more pilates, but i was disappointed in the pilates moves presented.  and the band is a bit cumbersome.",1281916800,,278,4.2075471698113205
3414326,5,B0018BEG5U,"I've done this dvd every other day for 2 weeks.  Yes the camera work is not that good. If you're explaining a new move the camera should focus on the new move as you're explaining...doesn't happen on this dvd.  But after you do the dvd 2-3 times you all ready know what to do.  I have to say that one thing that annoys me, it seems like every 20 seconds she says ""beginners watch Kelsie"".  After a while I'm like I get it all ready,  beginners watch Kelsie.  I'm giving it 5 stars because after doing it every other day,after 2 weeks  I am much more tone, my muscles are longer and leaner, not bulky.  I have dropped 2 dress sizes. Also I completely tore my ACL last year and have not gotten it operated on yet.  This dvd did not aggravate my knee.(I just make sure I am careful doing the squats and dips.) For the amazing results I have gotten, I have to give this dvd 5 stars.",1279497600,4,878,4.117647058823529
3414327,4,B0018BEG5U,"Great work out.  Only 40 minutes long and comes with a pink latex band.  Just like other reviews mention, the camera work was a little poor at being at the right place when exercises change.  This is a good workout for an off day.",1274572800,,230,4.181818181818182
3414328,4,B0018BEG5U,"This video seems like it is a really easy work out, but the next day, I realized that I had done more work than I thought. The sculpting work is great!",1265328000,,151,3.903225806451613
3414329,5,B0018BEG5U,"Great workout. Not too challenging, but the results are amazing! Make sure you have plenty of floor space, however, as you find yourself spread out all over the place.",1261699200,,167,4.793103448275862
3414330,5,B0018BEG5U,"Like another reviewer, I got turned on to this routine after seeing the first 20 minutes of it on my cable's ""free on demand"" exercise channel.

I am not a gym person, or an aerobics person. I don't like anything that has a lot of shouting, or blaring music, or complicated choreography, or frankly, anything that elicits a lot of huffing and puffing!

This DVD, however, is highly effective while containing none of the above elements. In particular, the stretch band is EXCELLENT at toning -- the ""sculpt"" part of the name of this DVD is well-deserved.

And if I noticed results after doing the 20-minute clip on my cable channel (which I did), wow, did I see a change in my overall condition after doing the full 50 minutes once I bought the DVD.

I currently use this DVD 2-3x/week, plus I attend a Pilates class one day per week. All I can tell you is that in six months, I went from wearing size 8 or 10 pants, to wearing size 2 or 4.

If you have been intimidated in the past by fast routines that you couldn't follow, or got turned off by instructors screaming things like, ""Hoo - hoo - yeah! -- Feel the burn!!"" this is a refreshing, very FEMININE change of pace.",1253750400,14,1172,4.3577981651376145
3414331,5,B0018BEG5U,"I saw part of this exercise DVD on Verizon on Demand. I got hooked, then they stopped playing it so I looked online to find a DVD. This is a great workout, but it doesn't kill you.",1247443200,2,180,3.891891891891892
8269095,5,B0018BEG5U,"I have enjoyed this very much but I had to quit using it because there are too many deep knee bends and I have problems with my knees. If your knees are working well, you will do fine.",1484697600,2,184,3.8684210526315788
8269096,5,B0018BEG5U,"IF you do this workout at least 3 times a week, you will see results in your body! Do it two weeks straight and you won't believe the results!",1479081600,2,142,3.9310344827586206

8269100,3,B0018BEG5U,Scultpilates is not as intense as most Firm workouts but a good change of pace in combination with other workout tapes.,1372723200,,119,4.714285714285714
8269101,5,B0018BEG5U,This was a great purchase for the quality and the price.  I would definately recommend this item to anyone to buy.,1360627200,,114,4.428571428571429
8269102,5,B0018BEG5U,"I got this DVD because I wanted a workout that would tone my body; I didn't want to lose weight or anything but just gain muscle. This workout is great for that. I've always been happy with The Firm workouts and was glad to find this one. It comes with a beginner resistance band, which is good to start off with. As I did the exercises regularly I found that my strength had improved to the point where I needed the next band up. I do this workout twice a week and people have asked, out of the blue, if I've been working on my arms because they say my arms look toned. I've also found it easier to lift things that I could not lift before. This workout is not easy, especially for people who don't normally do strength exercises, but it feels good when it's over knowing that I've accomplished it. It's also about 1 hour long so I have to make sure to set aside an hour on the days that I do it. This DVD works my arms, legs, and abs and is a perfect complement to the cardio and yoga DVDs that I do. I would hightly recommend this DVD to anyone, especially women, who want a workout that will tone their bodies and improve their strength.",1356566400,6,1141,4.1441441441441444
8269103,4,B0018BEG5U,"This workout is fantastic for those who wish to tone and strengthen.  The only problem I saw was that when she would cue to watch the trainer doing beginner moves the camera did not focus on that trainer enough.  Luckily, I know pilates and found the workout excellent.",1349827200,,269,4.583333333333333
8269104,5,B0018BEG5U,"I have three children and have used this DVD after each one. It gets you back in shape quick, if you stick with it. It works your entire body and goes at a good pace. Not too fast, not too slow. She explains everything very well. Easy to follow, and it is actually fun to do! I don't dread doing it. I see results within days! Love this DVD!",1339027200,2,341,3.9565217391304346
