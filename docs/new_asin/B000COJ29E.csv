8099863,4,B000COJ29E,"This hour-long concert filmed in York, PA in 2005, features Thomas and his current Drifters group, Louis Bailey, Jermone Manning, and Stephen Brown, backed by their own band. Now in his early 70s, Thomas and his soulful tenor shine on the staples of their act, ""Up On The Roof"", ""When My Little Girl Is Smiling"", and ""Under The Boardwalk"", and some surprises, including ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"", ""Dance With Me"", ""I Count The Tears"", and powerful renditions of Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" and Louis Armstrong's ""What A Wonderful World"".  If you've seen Charlie and his group in concert, or watched them on one of the PBS shows and wanted more- this DVD is an ideal selection.  The sound and video are top notch throughout and- even better- the money from sales goes directly to the artists themselves.  Charlie, who joined in 1958, and Ben E. King, are the only Drifters members to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame who are still with us today.",1211241600,,967,4.643274853801169
8099864,1,B000COJ29E,"by far charlie thomas is the best lead singer with the drifters, but what he forgot, is that in is best days his hits were backed by string instruments. On this disc a regular band,did him no justice. His songs were not good because the lack of the string instruments. As a follower of the Drifters, I would not recommend this DVD unless I was a true fan of the Drifters.",1207180800,,371,4.23943661971831
