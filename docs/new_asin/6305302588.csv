For that reason, I doubted this movie was of any quality, one, because it was pre-Begnini days of the comic genius and two, I rarely ever heard of it!  I hesitated on this movie and I was right.

This ill-conceived plot trods along, is poor on subtitles and sound, not funny as it may have intended to be, and to top that, it is just plain boring!

He is a teacher who does things differently, has a romance, some interaction with kindergartners, and I can't say anything else.  I didn't get it and I whizzed through it.

Skip this one.  I can't imagine Begnini thrilled that this poorly made movie is out, especially since we know him as the famous, talented and hysterically funny, Begnini.

I Highly Recommend some brilliantly funny Begnini movies:

Really this movie is social commentary underneath a simple storyline with some comedic moments.
An idealistic, albeit goofy, young man decides to turn his hand to running a nursery school program in an industrialized part of a major city where all of the children's parents are employed by the local factory.  So if you think about the socialist and marxist ideals of many young Italians (before the Craxi debacle) who grew up while Italy was transforming into the economically powerful, yet deeply troubled, nation it is today; you can see how this movie was very timely for the 1970s. It's got so many different messages within it (communism, educational reform, mental health care for children or lack there of, the fading ideal of the nuclear family, Bologna, the Red Brigades, children's rights, the lack of support for families and the encroaching and overwhelming demands of life in a totally capitalist society  and on and on... not to mention Benigni's character's existential dilemmas) that you could really watch this film many, many times. This movie is not at all Hollywood and neither is it Cinecitta (and honestly,in the year 2007 - sadly, what's the difference?) that it's great. Yes, at times you feel like your watching a student film, but I kind of liked the less-than-perfect visual and audio quality; it made the film feel more authentic.
If you don't know or care about Italy, Italians, history, and children, you won't like this film. If you want some light-hearted Benigni vehicle like Johnny Stecchino, you will detest this movie.
If you are interested in 1970s Italy and, in my opinion, the time when Italy made a wrong turn (with much prodding and manipulation by the US), you will enjoy it. It's a glimpse into history and I found it very, very refreshing. It helps if you speak and/or read Italian well, the subtitles don't do the film justice.",1110931200,8,2082,4.911931818181818
7887243,1,6305302588,"Being a Benigni fan, I purchased this video on faith.  The film and sound quality are poor and the plot difficult/impossible to follow.  With three of us watching, we had to stop the tape to discuss what was going on; not  because we were enthralled, but because we were lost.",947203200,10,276,4.48
