7869269,3,6304389396,To be honest I was kind of dissapointed when I got this video. I thought it was a collection of music videos from the ova/oav series. I guess I should've done more research. Oh well at least it's part of my Ranma 1/2 collection.,1206748800,,228,4.204545454545454
7869270,4,6304389396,"The ranma 1/2 video jukebox is good for the ranma fans that liked the sonds from the series...
i was disapointed from it because there are no subtitles or the song lyrics and the OVA songs are not included...
thanks",1018051200,,215,4.4
7869271,5,6304389396,"When I first saw this video, I thought 'the cheek of Viz', but then on second thoughts, it was a pretty good idea.  It's a must for any anime turned JPOP fan I can assure you.  The music is somewhat dated, but that hardly matters to any fans.
Each sequence is a 'music video' of the opening and closing credits.  The bonus is that the animation is not disturbed by credits.  This being said, I found it disappointing that the lyrics were not subtitled.
I think this video will really only appeal to the Ranma fan who also enjoys JPOP.  Only the will see real value in this video.  I don't think it really appeals to the just a Ranma or just a JPOP fan.",981244800,4,652,4.176
7869272,5,6304389396,"This subtitled, 3-episode volume of Ranma 1/2 is a great thing to have for any collector.  The video contains ""A Tear in a Girl-Delinquent's Eye?  The end of the Martial Arts Rhythmic Gymnastics Challenge"",  ""Pelvic Fortune-Telling?  Ranma is the No. One Bride in Japan"",  and ""Enter Shampoo, the Gung-Ho Girl!  I put my life in your  hands"".  The first episode tells of the end of a three episode  confrontation between Ranma and ""Kodachi, the Black Rose"" in  Martial Arts Rhythmic Gymnastics.  The second episode, while basically a  filler, is hilarious.  Dr. Tofu's mother comes to town trying to set him up  with someone to marry.  Combined with his shyness, his mother's craziness,  Ranma's curse, Nibiki's lust for money, and Akane's crush on the young  doctor, sheer chaos breaks out!  And lastly, the third episode introduces  Shampoo, the Chinese Amazon girl that swore to kill Ranma after a  humiliating defeat.  I would recommend this video for anybody looking for a  great series or trying to fill gaps in their collection.",960681600,2,1035,5.0
7869273,4,6304389396,Why does Ranma not get along with Akane's new pet pig p-chan? You will find out in this episode as Ryoga finnaly tells the story of his troubles in chasing after Ranma witch lead to a illfated trip to Jusenkyo. In this  tape we are treated to another rare sweet scene between Ranma and Akane.  This tape contains nudity and mild suggestive situations.,949968000,,351,4.555555555555555
7869274,5,6304389396,"If you love the opening and ending animations to Ranma 1/2, this is a great thing to have. All intros and endings are on this VHS tape devoid of credits. You can see all of them unobstructed. Included with the tape is a  song-sheet with lyrics (romanized for non-Japanese-speakers of course) and  translations of the songs so you can sing-a-long. My only complaint is that  they didn't include on-screen lyrics (karaoke style).",948326400,5,427,4.902777777777778
