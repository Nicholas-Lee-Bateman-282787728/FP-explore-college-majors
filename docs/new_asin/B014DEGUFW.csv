8730333,3,B014DEGUFW,"A hit and miss movie that provides insight into the violence, drugs, and suffering, as well as the triumphs that goes on in the urban projects. Although  it is framed in the the vein of Boyz n the Hood, Menace to Society, El Barrio, and El Bola, the film falls short in establishing if it is a comedy, a dramedy, or a melodrama with violence.
 Ironically, the story takes place in housing (HUD) named after famous and renowned literary heroes -- El Casero Llorens Torres. It is advertised and promoted as a Romeo and Juliet story, rather it's more of a Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise remake of West Side Story without the dancing and songs . The songs leitmotif the characters and anticipate or foreshadows situations as if the director did not trust our understanding of the characters and situations depicted --probably influenced by Sergei Eisenstein but doubtful. Although, it has some great moments, others are typically dragged by the influence of soap acting and its tendency to milk the dramatic moments to the point of exhaustion. One finds oneself fast forwarding it to end it and move to the next scene. The editing is good, yet at times again, one feels is being hit over the head with what is about to happen or scenes overextended. It is shot beautifully, well lit, and the flashback scene, as well as the love montage set the tone of what eventually will happen.  In the end the whole movie is predictable, even the ending... almost a parallel to the final scene of West Side story with a the caveat (spoiler alert) the feeling that you will hear a version of Tupac's Life goes on... and you do, sort of in Spanish narrated voice over. Commendable is that most of the performers in the movie were in the play and some manage to make the transition to film nicely. Whereas others were a bit too over the top, as a surprising to me was to see a professional actress such as Sully Diaz mugging for the camera in the early scenes and too over the top in the melodramatic parts. Perhaps in more able directing hands of such great acting coaches such as Dean Zayas, Idalia Perez Garay, and/or Roberto Ramos Perea the attempt to ""realistic style of acting"" would have succeeded. In the end we are left with a soap style of acting that distracts from the seriousness of what the author and director intended.",1504396800,,2315,4.586956521739131
