8211231,5,B000Q6HCBS,"Iron Monkey and In the Line of Duty 4 are the two DVD that this ""collection"" includes, and this is important to know because accidentally I bought Iron Monkey again.

These two movies come digitally remastered, so, they are pretty clear with nitid colors. They are in Chinese with titles in Chinese and English only.

Iron Monkey seems to be an outstanding wired wushia. The actors are flying across the sets in some escenes, but in some others they show they natural and incredible fighting skills (2 guys, a woman and a kid).

A must see movie!

In the line of duty 4 since the beginning offers what Hong Kong action movies do like no others: Fights with great action.

All along the movie the action never even take a break... I found it excessive but always so exciting. Donnie Yen has an extraordinary duel with a very muscled black guy on the roof of a building.

Another must see movie!",1230336000,,893,4.515527950310559
