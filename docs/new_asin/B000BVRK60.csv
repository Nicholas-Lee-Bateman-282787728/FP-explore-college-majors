2443339,5,B000BVRK60,"I used to take Yoga Booty Ballet in Los Angeles and loved it because I saw a difference! The classes were fun and dealt more with making the body lean and opposed to bulking up. I am no longer in Los Angeles and was so disappointed that I thought I would try the DVD. It is just like the class without the LA traffic! I LOVE this DVD and have been doing it 5 times a week and seeing a great difference in my body the way I want to. If you want long, lean, toned muscles use this DVD. Don't be fooled by the yoga or ballet moves thinking they are not effective. By far these exercises are the most effective I have ever done and very easy to do in your room. You don't have to run around the room knocking things over. Many of the exercises are small movements.  I give this DVD an A+! Try it! You will LOVE it!",1237334400,2,810,3.9390243902439024
2443340,5,B000BVRK60,"this is one of my oldie but goodies ! I always love doing this DVD and I never tire of it. The music is very uptempo which makes you want to move and dance , making working out (gasp!) fun and the girls are easy to follow. I love that yoga is also added in this DVD. Trust me you can't go wrong getting this DVD; I recommend any of the yoga booty ballet series.",1232236800,3,361,3.8266666666666667
2443341,3,B000BVRK60,"This is not an excellent video, but it's not bad either. A little bit exagerated. The video has a ""yoga"" part that is not relaxing , the ""ballet "" part is not ballet at all..LOL...it's just a couple of exercises for the booty. The warm-up part is more than exagerated..even funny.",1229904000,2,280,4.509803921568627
2443342,5,B000BVRK60,"This DVD offers a great versatile workout. It includes separate segments that fit your schedule for a particular day. You can do warmup alone, or add aerobic, toning with weights for upper/lower body, yoga style exercises or abs section. There's a segment for every body part. An added bonus is the beautiful music/Tabla that Ravi plays in the background, the beautiful surroundings, serene backdrop and inspirational beginning at the beginning of the DVD.

It is recommended prior to starting this workout that your body is warmed up and that the workout is started at a slow pace as you will be *sore* after the lower body workouts. You may want to cut down a few minutes and end early to allow yourself to resume the next day. Once you are very sore the tendency is to skip workouts altogether for a few days which would slow down the results. You have the DVD and you can always do it as often as you want so go slow and steady. Once you are accustomed, you will be less sore and able to complete and enjoy the workouts.",1142121600,19,1024,4.505376344086022
2443343,4,B000BVRK60,"This is actually my favorite from the set.  I'd tried the lives and they were too goofy for me.  This set also comes with another workout that I'm not as fond of.

The Basic and Advanced REALLY work on your buns .. and I like that.  It's different than other exercises.  Although I like the toning from this...  I cannot do it stand alone--  It's fun.. but my heart rate never rises.  I'm not sure tht it was supposed to.. That might ruin how relaxing this dvd is overall.  I'd compare it to yoga moreso than ballet.. because in ballet-- you do sweat and your heart rate does rise.  In yoga..  You tone.. your heart rate doesnt go up-- it's relaxing.

If you are trying to improve your cardio (which is what I'm doing) then you might need a little something extra.  I'm not overweight... but I can see this as being a nice add on for someone that is attempting to tone up and loose weight... If you're looking for variety.  I loooove variety-- and So does the body!

What Workouts I'm comparing this to:  Any of my workouts that had ""butt"" exercises where I only felt them in my thighs -- Step aerobics, squats lunges...  I was even lifting up my toes to try and REALLY feel it in my butt-- but no.  I did deeper lungest.. lower squats.. still nothing in my butt.  I still love those programs.. but this one was a nice extra something.

But Again-- I didn't really like anything else from the YBB set.  I know they have a Master Series that just came out.. but I'm not jumping to buy it because I really didn't enjoy their other workouts.  Not to mention.. beachbody is oh so difficult!  I haven't had an order that arrived in less than 3 weeks -- or abnormal charges to my credit card that I have to hastle them to refund (which they also do slowly)....",1132531200,39,1754,4.280487804878049
2443344,4,B000BVRK60,"The following review is for the Basic segment only; I will come back and reivew the Advanced once I have tried it.

Yoga Booty Ballet Basic is a fun workout in which you'll target your entire body with a variety of different exercise styles; like the title suggests, however, the emphasis is on the lower body, particularly the ""booty"" area. Instructors Gillian Marloth and Teigh McDonough are very enthusiastic, constantly smiling and frequently encouraging you to ""get funky"" or simply grunting ""uh-huh!"" They take turns leading each segment, sometimes with a class of participants, sometimes just the two of them on their own, in various outdoor settings.

The workout begins with a 5-minute warm-up that includes dancey-type moves as well as stretches; the warm-up is led by Teigh with Gillian and 3 others in the background. Next comes a 7-minute ballet segment, filmed by a pretty pond area with Gillian and Teigh alone. Gillian leads here, doing front, side, and back leg lifts and concentrating on the glutes all the while; there are also some 1-legged squats between the moves. I liked this better than other ballet workouts I've tried, mainly because you don't use a chair for balance and because you're focusing more intently on the ""booty"" area.

Teigh leads Gillian and the lone male participant, Andy, for the following segment. Although she describes it as cardio work, it might be better thought of as aerobic weight training, as you are moving quickly enough to get your heart rate up while using light weights. The exercises in this section include plies, squats, and various arm moves such as bicep curls, shoulder presses, and triceps french press for a total of 9 1/2 minutes. The following segment, yoga, was my least favorite, which is surprising since I enjoy yoga and practice it regularly. I think part of the reason I didn't like this section because I found Gillian's voiceover cueing to be poor. Also, the yoga is vinyasa-style, which means you keep repeating a series of linked postures, and after the weight work, I found this very tiring. The full class is back for this segment, which is 8 minutes long.

Teigh again takes the lead over Gillian and Andy for a short (6 minutes) but intense section focused on abdominals. They use a ""squishy ball"" held between the legs to add extra resistance, and I found my Pilates fitness circle to be an adequate substitute. The moves are tradional crunches, but the use of the prop makes the work more difficult. To end the workout, Teigh leads the full class in some simple stretches, beginning on the floor and then moving to a standing position. The stretch segment is 4 1/2 minutes long, bringing the entire workout in at 40 minutes. Although the overall workout is relatively short, you will feel thoroughly worked out by the end, and both my buns and abs felt it the next day. I would have prefered the segments to be arranged a bit differently--e.g., I would not have had the yoga come right after the strength/cardio portion--but overall, I really enjoyed this video. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a fun workout with a ""booty"" focus.",1132272000,54,3123,4.853658536585366

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to have fun while working out and get stronger while doing it!",1361059200,,248,4.1875

8093295,1,B000BVRK60,"I ordered this product with hopes of recieving Yoga Booty Ballet, instead i recieved a different DVD in the yoga booty ballet box. Unfortunately I had thrown away the packaging and invoice.",1360195200,,189,4.9375
8093296,2,B000BVRK60,"I ordered this DVD looking for a good Yoga workout, and its not what I got.
The warm-ups are ridiculous. It gets your heart pumping, sure, but I felt like a fool trying to do the moves they were doing.

The Yoga section was very disappointing. I understand Vinyasa yoga is a fluid practice moving position to position, but they should have changed up the positions.  They do a few cycles of only 4 moves...over and over and over.  To be honest I got so bored I turned the video off and went to something else.

I wouldnt waste your time or money on this.",1346198400,,554,4.247619047619048
8093297,3,B000BVRK60,I ordered this product on a whim. I liked the ballet part but most of it was too cheesy for me. The whole Koi pond and japaneese music got to me,1341532800,,144,3.6774193548387095
8093298,3,B000BVRK60,"I have only done the first part/half, 'The Basics'.  If you're looking for fun music and dance, this is not it. You can barely hear the little music they do feature.  The exercises aren't bad, but pretty basic.  and the two ladies leading the video drive me a little crazy.  You do get a slight work-out but it's not extremely difficult.",1337212800,,337,4.475409836065574
8093299,1,B000BVRK60,"I bought YBB at the recommendation of a friend.  I find it, ""just okay"".  To me it is not entertaining enough to keep me intrigued to go back to it. I have only used it twice.",1310947200,,175,3.8333333333333335
8093300,1,B000BVRK60,"I wanted to be able to learn how to do 'steps'.  This video starts slow and explains some things about yoga, then rips full speed into dancing--wow, take my money and don't teach me first before i am just jump in.  If only you could have broken the moves down first, taught them in sequence with some pointers and then said 'ok, now lets put them together'..but you did not.  If only you could have done the routine to slow music, then speeded it up,...but you did not.  you are not teachers. i have no time to waste and very little money to waste.  I took the time to do this review because i am so very unhappy with this product.",1295827200,,631,4.181818181818182
8093301,2,B000BVRK60,"While this will give your booty and legs a workout, I was disappointed on two counts.  One is the music -- there is no discernible melody, and the drums (?) are tediously repetitive.  I need to be motivated by music when I workout, so I was dreading the idea of doing this workout again.  I've decided to find a suitable music CD, and play it simultaneously with the silenced DVD.  The other disappointment for me is the videographer's choice of focus.  Many times he/she focuses on the face, chest, or upper arms of the instructor, when the action is all going on in the legs.  It's extremely frustrating to try to follow along when I can't see the moves!  I find this inexcusable in what is supposed to be an instructional video.",1268006400,4,731,4.492424242424242
8093302,5,B000BVRK60,"I'm not one for reviews but I have to say YBB is a motivating at home work out on days I can't make it to the gym. I look forward to doing it and I don't feel I am getting any less of a work out than if I did my usual 1 1/2 hour at the gym. I really like the instructors they don't make me think loud hateful things at my television haha... Anyway, I got hooked on these when I was using netflix and will definitely be buying more of them. Like I said I don't feel its a frilly slacker video just to alleviate the guilt of not going to the gym I think it really compliments my muscle training, swimming and running... also it gives a great core work out... better than some machines. It leaves me feeling worked out but also energized and self-aware. I would recommend it to anyone.",1262217600,,782,4.019230769230769
