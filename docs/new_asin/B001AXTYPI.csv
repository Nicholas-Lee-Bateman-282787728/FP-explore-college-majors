3473215,5,B001AXTYPI,"Wait a second! These reviews are for the Curious George movie, which is ENTIRELY different from this DVD, a compilation of about eight shows from PBS kids. The difference? The shows are humorous, entertaining, and delightful! (and also very educational)The movie was NOT. Don't be confused- if you're looking for the movie, this isn't it. This is much better!",1221091200,25,359,5.101694915254237

3473242,5,B001AXTYPI,"I love Curious George but my 4 year old loves him even more. There are several episodes on the disc which will be great when we make the 12hour+ trip to Grandma's house this summer. This is going to be a Christmas present. Based on the pics on the back of the box, it looks just like that one on tv (same animation).",1380585600,,316,4.031746031746032

3473254,5,B001AXTYPI,"Bought few Curious George DVDs for my 4 years old granddaughter and WE both been having our ""glorious and wondrous"" special time together watching them.  Educational with always a good lesson behind them besides that he is so lovable and cute. My granddaughter often sings the theme song everywhere she goes.

The episode on night creatures is great too. he learnt quite a bit about possums!",1367452800,,187,4.371428571428571
3473257,5,B001AXTYPI,"I am so sick of the programming on Disney Channel teaching my boy that if you want to get down from a tree you need a giant piece of celery to slide down.  We try and give our child other things to do, but the reality is that sometimes it is just more appropriate to let him watch some TV...if you can stand the agenda of the people making the programs.

Then we ran across Curious George and were relieved.  No agendas, no politically correct subject matter, no illogical logic.  The first time we watched one it was like taking your shoes off after a long walk on a summer day...aaahhhh.

To top it off, each DVD only costs around $10. I ended up buying 10 different titles and have been happy with every one...thus I will copy and paste this review on each one of them.

This is one happy dad who loves that annoying monkey.",1366070400,,827,4.235668789808917

3473262,5,B001AXTYPI,"My 2 year old loves watching Curious George on pbs while at home.  We must have several dozen episodes recorded.  Now when we go on road trips, we are able to watch Curious George thanks to the dvds.  They are the same episodes you watch on tv. Each DVD contains 8 shows totaling over 90 minutes of pure entertainment for our child to watch.",1355270400,,341,4.296875

3473286,4,B001AXTYPI,"Several short very typical Curious George stories: no surprises, short, easily understood.  Only one of the 'episodes' involves pirates.  Not my grandson's favorite DVD, but is ok.",1308700800,,180,5.62962962962963

3473288,5,B001AXTYPI,"My two year old likes to watch this one again and again, and the episodes are entertaining enough that I can watch them with here and enjoy them.  Watching George solve his problems, particularly through the used of colors and shapes and numbers, proves inspirational when viewed together; and I love to hear her laugh at his antics.  Highly recommended for Curious George lovers.",1293926400,6,380,4.921875
3473289,5,B001AXTYPI,"This DVD has such entertaining stories.  The stories are so much fun that children don't realize that they are learning something too.

This is good, clean, educational fun for children.",1289347200,2,303,4.454545454545454
3473290,5,B001AXTYPI,"We own 10 George dvds.  This is my 3 year old's favorite one.  I'm very VERY picky about what my kids watch, so I was really excited to finally find something pirate-related that meets my approval.  Although it is just one episode, the ""pirate one!"" is the only one my son asks for anymore.  I like that they made TMWTYH (If you've watched George enough, surely you know what I mean: The Man With The Yellow Hat) be the (sort-of)villainous pirate - its hilarious how he keeps forgetting to  be rough and say ""yarrrr!""  Another amazing addition to the Curious George series from PBS!",1281744000,3,582,4.548076923076923
3473291,5,B001AXTYPI,This was our fifth or sixth Curious George DVD purchase and we're still extremely happy with them every time.  Curious George is one of the only shows that our little one can watch and enjoy without causing everyone to want to flee the room!  So many shows for kids make adults grind their teeth at the thought of watching or hearing it one more time.  Not Curious George - they are funny and entertaining enough that our teenager will actually get caught up and giggle occasionally.,1264896000,4,483,4.593023255813954
3473292,5,B001AXTYPI,"These episodes include Hundley the lobby dog along with George.
