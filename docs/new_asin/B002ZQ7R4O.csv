Most interesting to me was As The World Turns from 1961 with Lisa pregnant with her first child. I love Eileen Fulton !  Valiant Lady from 1953 had Helen Wagner. She portrayed Nancy Hughes over 50 years on As The World Turns. As The World Turns from 1960 featured Frances Reid who portrayed Alice Horton for over 40 years on Days Of Our Lives. One rare show Love Is A Many Splendored Thing from 1967 feratured Leslie Charleson who still plays Monica Quartermain on General Hospital. Early episodes of  The Guiding Light in 1953 feature the Bauer family. Valiant Lady from 1953 feature Andrew Duggan, and in a rare acting role the author of A Chorus Line and PS Your Cat Is Dead, James Kirkwood as Mickey Emerson. Don Knotts is in a 1953 episode of Search For Tomorrow. A special Search For Tomorrow episode to me was the 1962 one feraturing Barbara Baxley. And so good to see episodes of Love Of Life, The Edge Of Night, and The Secret Storm. Such a wonderful collection.",1339372800,34,1068,4.528497409326425
4042127,5,B002ZQ7R4O,"Most people know that the television networks destroyed most videotapes of their daytime soap operas during the 1950's through the end of the 1970's. The fact that so much of our serial history is lost is distressing. However, there were some episodes that were spared the wiping process (a term TV executives use when referring to reusing videotape). In this excellent set viewers get a chance to see some old classic serials from the 1950's and early 1960's with their original commercials in tact from their network airings. Fans get to see some of the more famous soap operas like ""Search for Tomorrow"" (in its original 15 minute installment), ""The Guiding Light"" as it was known in its early days (also in 15 minute airings), as well as little known soaps like ""The Brighter Day"" and ""Valiant Lady"".

 Also in this set are 30 minute episodes of ""The Edge of Night"", 3 shows of ""As the World Turns"" and my personal favorite ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"" from 1967. That particular episode (although filmed in color) is presented here in its kinescope version and is in black and white.

 Sit back and see how soap operas are suppose to be soap operas, not the trash that we are fed today!",1325635200,15,1196,4.654028436018957

8385217,5,B002ZQ7R4O,"I love old soaps and these are pretty cool! You get the original commericals, too and some of them are quite silly for today's time. I was named after a soap character, so I was hoping I'd get this soap to see my character name sake. The sound and screen quality is not great but the price isn't too high and you will love them.",1447113600,4,328,4.061538461538461
8385218,4,B002ZQ7R4O,Loved this--especially the commercials.  Wonderful to watch.,1445558400,2,60,7.571428571428571

8385220,5,B002ZQ7R4O,"Thanks.  It's really nice, but some of the episodes were before my time, though.  However, nonetheless, I found them enjoyable.",1398988800,,127,5.3
8385221,4,B002ZQ7R4O,It was fun to see episodes from long ago.  I wish they had done more of Edge of Night and less of Secret Storm since our CBS station never carried the show during its twenty-year run.  Hope there will be more Classic TV Soaps in the future.,1395446400,6,240,4.085106382978723
8385222,5,B002ZQ7R4O,This is a top of the line dvd set!!  I would recommend this to anyone.  I hope that more sets come out like this one!  Great job!,1388188800,3,129,3.7037037037037037
8385223,5,B002ZQ7R4O,"I ordered the Classic TV Soaps DVD set on October 18th. I thought it would be about two weeks before the product arrived. It came within 6 days. I am so happy it came sooner than expected.

I was just like a little child as I opened to view it. I have to say, the quality was actually pretty good. I saw Peggy McKay, who plays Mrs. Brady on, ""Days of Our Lives"".  I may be wrong, but I thought I also saw a young Mary Fickett, who played Ruth Martin on, ""All My Children"". I haven't seen Don Knotts yet, (per one of the reviews, he is in one of the episodes), because I haven't watched all the episodes, but I look forward to seeing him.

While watching these wonderful episodes, I found myself wanting to see more. I have watched some of these soaps, such as, Edge of Night and Search for Tomorrow but that was in the 70s so it was great to see very early episodes of them. It would be nice if a DVD set were out there for soaps that came out later than 1963 that are no longer around.",1382659200,12,986,4.020408163265306
8385224,5,B002ZQ7R4O,it was great.wished the guiding light episodes had papa bauer in them and more cast members from the edge of  night episode.but the dvd was great.a great history lesson.recomend to any long time soap fan.,1360972800,10,204,4.828571428571428
8385225,5,B002ZQ7R4O,"This is a must have for any seasoned soap fan!  I grew up watching soaps so this 6 DVD set was a real treat!  There were a few soaps I had never heard of, but the basic ones like Edge of Night, Guiding Light, Love is a Many Splendored Thing, Love of Life, Search for Tomorrow & Secret Storm were wonderful to see again!  An added bonus:  the original commercials (most notably a Libbys commercial with Mclean Stevenson) and a very young Don Knotts on SFT?  Who knew???  Just hearing the theme songs in the opening introductions brought back memories!  I wish my Mom was still around so that we could watch this together!  Through the years Ive watched a lot of soaps (Dark Shadows was a favorite) but have stuck with the CBS soaps and remember when Search for Tomorrow and Guiding Life were both 15-minutes long.  I don't think a lot of people quite understand the soap phenomena and the extremely loyal fans they have created.  Ive watched the same soaps for decades; whenever I was at work I still kept track of what was going on (pre-VCR and Soap Net).  A few times Id be discussing plot lines on the phone with my Mom and someone in the room would think I was talking about a real person!  I was very sad when they took Guiding Light and As the World Turns off the air.  I just hope they leave Young & Restless and The Bold & Beautiful alone!  These DVDs were worth every penny!",1355875200,24,1382,4.3062015503875966
