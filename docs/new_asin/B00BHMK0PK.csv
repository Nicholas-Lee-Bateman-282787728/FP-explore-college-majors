8568605,3,B00BHMK0PK,I haven't watched it all yet but so far it is frustrating to watch because the camera is focused on their hips  and faces and not on the dance. There is no need for close ups with this kind of presentation. We miss so much when we have to look at an individuals instead of the dance they are doing.,1530835200,,298,3.966666666666667
8568606,3,B00BHMK0PK,"A bit too cutesy with all the women fawning over each other between acts, which seemed awkward and forced.  Come on, we know this is a women's dance but it was a bit cloying and silly.  Colleena Shakti is absolutely fabulous as usual, some of the other dancers were very good as well, but some were outright amateur and even embarrassing to watch.  However, for what it was, (not a professional production) it was interesting.",1432857600,,426,4.653333333333333
