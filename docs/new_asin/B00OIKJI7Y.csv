8683785,2,B00OIKJI7Y,"I thought E.Hurley would be good with a ""Russian"" accent; Not much of an accent and she wasn't in the movie a lot; Viktor was and except for one co-star, this movie is disappointing. I liked Hurley with Denis Leary in Double Whammy, but goodness this one and ""Kill Cruise"" did me in for her for a while. Well actually I think I'll get On Dangerous Ground.",1467763200,,355,4.313432835820896
8683786,2,B00OIKJI7Y,"I thought this would be so much better. I was looking forward to seeing it and like Gerard Depardieu, so it was hard not to be disappointed in the end. I kept thinking things would pick up and a very slow movie would get better, but that never happened and I had a hard time just staying away until the end.",1445126400,,307,4.049180327868853
8683787,4,B00OIKJI7Y,"Unlike other reviewers, I thought this movie deserves more than one or two stars.  For one thing, Depardieu is completely believable as a Russian criminal.  In fact, he seems more Russian than the Russians, which only proves that he really is a wonderful actor, and his physique is as typically Russian as the Steppes.  His physique is not atypical for a large, middle aged Russian man.  Depardieu turns the character ""Viktor"", in fact, into a force of nature, as big and implacable as Russia itself. He is amazingly well-cast in the role.

In the film, Depardieu plays ""Viktor,"" a sorrowing ex-con who returns to Russia from a French prison specifically to avenge the death of his only child, a son who has been in university but fell in with the wrong crowd and ended up working for a big-time Russian gangster who smuggles arms and diamonds before the son was killed by them.  Russia is a leading producer of both arms and diamonds, so the plot is completely credible. Elizabeth Hurley, the female lead, plays a ""hostess"" in a posh hotel who is on the fringe of the Moscow underworld via its ""escort services.""  She is an old love of burly, ham-fisted Viktor, and is not only beautiful but clever, matching wits with the mainly ineffectual police and the gangsters.

Another good thing about the movie is that Israeli actor Eli Danker finally gets billing alongside the two stars.  Eli Danker deserves far better roles than he usually gets -- he has jokingly complained that he's usually cast either as an Arab terrorist or a Mossad spy.  On American TV, he has appeared in ""West Wing"" as the Israeli Defense Minister, and in ""NCIS"" as the Mossad's Washington chief of station, for two examples.  He also  appeared as ""Judas Iscariot"" in the film ""Jesus""-- giving a creditable and well-cast performance in an otherwise dreadful Bible film where the character Jesus wears an obvious ridiculous wig!  In ""Viktor,"" for a complete change, Danker plays a muslim Chechen ballet master who has been a friend of Viktor's, and who assists Viktor as the ex-con plows into the underworld to find his son's killer.  Danker is actually a musician of some talent in addition to his acting career.  The supporting actors, particularly the female Russian police boss and the arch-criminal, are well cast and skilled actors in their own right..

Much has been written about Russian gangsters, and this film brings them to life.  Their brutality and psychopathic means of murder don't need any further descriptions-- the film is violent, yes, but the Russian underworld has in fact brought violence and brutality to horrific new levels, with tentacles throughout Europe.  These sadistic ruffians are the worst of the worst in the world of crime, so the violence is not out of place nor is it gratuitous as in so many American crime/police fiction films.

The movie contains some great cinematography of Moscow as well as the brooding immensity of rural Russia.  The film adds a unique look at a Chechen dance-- quite an unexpected treat for anyone interested in dance and folk dances.  All in all, this film is underrated in my opinion.  It's not for the squeamish, but if you like police fiction, suspense, thrillers, and cinema verite, this one's for you.  It's dark, yes, but the Russian underworld hardly consists of cotton candy.  I wouldn't expect most Americans to respond well to it-- it's very European, dark and occasionally gruesome, with subtleties that are easily missed on this side of the Atlantic, accustomed as we are to Hollywood shoot-em-up car chases and other such pablum.  There is a car chase in the film, and it's predictably nail-biting.  But in my opinion, ""Viktor"" is well worth watching as a unique offering in its genre.  I would have given it 4.5 stars but don't know how to do that.",1437868800,,3798,4.8390092879256965
8683788,4,B00OIKJI7Y,"After seven years in prison, Viktor Lambert returns to Moscow decided to find out the truth about the murder of his son Jeremy. Once he is there will be some old friends who will aid to complete his own persoanl revenge.

Dark Noir, that depicts us the unsaid story of smuggling diamonds, betrayal and double cross.

I really liked it, even it's far from being a masterwork, but at least it gets the goal.",1425859200,,405,4.45945945945946
8683789,1,B00OIKJI7Y,"What might have been an interesting drama about a gangster father dealing with his son dying while he was in jail gets turned by some lunatics idea into a action film featuring a morbidly obese senior citizen. Silly when it isn't dull, with a distracting insistence on having most of the heavily-accented actors speak English for no reason whatsoever.",1422576000,,351,4.966101694915254
8683790,1,B00OIKJI7Y,"I was very disappointed in this movie. It was so boring, and I like GD , but he and everyone else in this movie had no feeling or rage to even make you want to watch it. In fact in one scene GD is looking to the side of the actress in front of him and just reading his lines like a dictation. The story itself made no sense to me. It was just a bunch of sets spliced together with hardly any real action. Maybe 20 years ago GD could have breathed some life into this movie but not now. Just a paycheck with no acting needed. Watch for free or forget it.",1421798400,,553,3.8596491228070176
8683791,1,B00OIKJI7Y,"This movie is awful. Poor acting, boaring predictable dialogue, poor sound. Don't waste your money.",1421625600,,99,5.666666666666667
