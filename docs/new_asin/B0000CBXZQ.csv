Lots of minutes in these series and relaxing and very well balanced...",1435881600,,203,5.580645161290323
7998963,5,B0000CBXZQ,This was a Christmas present for my husband who must have borrowed this DVD from the library 100 of times. He was very pleased to add this DVD to our DVD collection. This DVD was made a while ago but still covers Caribbean in a great detail. Highly recommended for everyone who loves Caribbean or who is planning to travel to Caribbean.,1293235200,,336,4.435483870967742
7998964,4,B0000CBXZQ,"I have to say... I totally disagree with the first 1-star review (and only one listed for this product).  I borrowed this DVD from our local library and actually checked it out a second time... and would definitely consider buying it at this Amazon price.
First of all, if you have a guidebook (such as Fodor's or Frommer's), great... start there.  But this is a great companion product for people like me who have been searching night and day on the internet for what to take pictures of on each port of my cruise.  So, this was the most delightful answer to that quest.
Yes, it is short and to the point... but you can choose any (or all) of the islands on the Eastern Caribbean tours of most cruise companies, and you have more than enough to visually stimulate, and prepare you for a wonderful time in each port.
It can even help you make up your mind what you want to do at each port, by SEEING it :)
So, for that reason I give it 4 stars.  It's not perfect, but a great companion piece to a good tourbook.  I suggest BOTH !!!",1235606400,5,1031,4.239795918367347
7998965,1,B0000CBXZQ,"This was a disappointment all around.  The production itself was cheaply done, and the time spent on the islands was minimal. Surprised to see that many major tourist attractions were not covered.  Just a lot of pictures of beaches and palm trees.  I gained nothing from viewing this video.  You will get so much more information from a tour book.  Put your money there.",1176422400,2,370,4.71875
