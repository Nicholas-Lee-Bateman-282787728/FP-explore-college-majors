8606240,4,B0001MXU40,"'Astroesque' is the film part of a science fiction triathlon of music, movie, and graphic novel. I haven't yet got my hands on The Gear's album 'Son of Red Rocket 7', but so far the graphic novel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Rocket-7/dp/1582409986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Rocket 7</a>) is the best part, and in addition to being thoroughly delightful in art and story, has the super benefit of working brilliantly well as a shiny textbook detailing the history of rock'n'roll.

Once I read it in its entirety, back in '98, I *had* to order the VHS of 'Astroesque' through my local comic shop. I watched it once through then, and kind of half-hated it and half wished it had a much bigger budget and some professional film editors and directors involved in the project. Back then I'd've given it one star.

Fifteen years on, I found the video buried in a paper bag full of, OF ALL THINGS WHAT?!, a bunch of 80s anime bootleg fansubs. Of course I rewatched it, and it'd been a while since I'd read the trade, so it wasn't fresh in my mind-- and this time around, the movie was phenomenal. I could see what Allred was doing with it, I could see why it was gritty and violent and bizarre and surreal, I could see what the whole DEAL was. And now the idea of the Red Rockets 1-7 all coming from The Original made perfect sense. His mission, his plans, who he ran from, who he belonged to-- and why he left them behind, which was a mystery in the graphic novel.

I feel like once I can get my hands on the album, all the puzzle pieces will finally be complete, and the epic in its entirety will be *wonderful*. Oh Mike Allred, and your amazing family, and your brilliant wife, you *are* a Renaissance Man.

Get a really really hardcore editor and rerelease this baby, and it's five stars all the way.",1357689600,,1847,4.656441717791411
