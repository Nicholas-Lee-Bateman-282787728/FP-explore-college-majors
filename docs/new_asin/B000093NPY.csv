1877250,5,B000093NPY,"Now, allow me just this little bit of time to open to flood gates of my ego, I promise you I won't be long.  When it comes to anime, I tend to think of myself as more learned than the average otaku.  I mean, I've been around this anime block several times over the course of several years and I've seen several titles come and go, sometimes for the best.  Then there are the familiar faces, you know them all, the ones that have been here longer than most, they know the game better than any recent title.  And you're glad that you know them.  ""City Hunter"" falls into this category.  In short; this is (say it with me class) classic anime.
  Created in 1985 by famous manga-ka Tsukasa Hojo, the story focuses on Ryo Saeba, a ""sweeper"" (sort of an urban mercenary, or a...city hunter!  Aha!) who takes on all sorts of dangerous jobs.  A cool-as-ice fighter with marksmanship skills that could rival Vash the Stampede.  With his .357 Colt Python, mini cooper, and a host of partners in the business, he's the man you call when you are out of options and desperately need the job done.  It would help a lot more if you were a pretty woman though.  You see, Ryo is what we like to call a ""sex-fiend,"" very much in the same vein as Golden Boy or Lupin III.  Although Ryo works hard to get his man, he works even harder to get his woman.  Which is both his skill and his undoing.
  The series was one of the better action animes to grace the screen when it first arrived circa 1987-88.  The series enjoyed mass appeal by the Japanese public.  Hailed by many critics as ""The worthy succesor to Lupin III,"" the series went on to produce 100+ episodes, several movies, TV specials, and manga.  The manga and the TV specials are available stateside and belong in any otakus collection.  Right, now with that short history lesson over, let's move onto an actual review.
  ""City Hunter"" is a fun series.  However, like most series that go for 100 episodes, it doesn't follow one plot as it does several tiny stories.  Most of these stories are great, some are good, and there's a small batch that is kinda boring.  Luckily, since this DVD box features the first 26 episodes, repetition isn't given any time to settle in.
  The animation is a bit dated, but it really doesn't detract from the action or the story-telling of the series.  The art is enjoybable because it manages to remain true to Hojo San's original drawings and maintains his style of story-telling.  It might irk some newbie otakus, but that's how you seperate the ""men from the mice.""
  Speaking of action sequences, this anime has manged to combine all the best elements of some of the greatest action movies.  From wild car chases to insane gun fights, every episode boasts its own thrill ride.
  The music is filled with an 80's kind of cool.  Sort of ""Miami Vice"" but much better.  This is 80's j-pop and j-rock, which is pretty much anykind of 80's music you can think of but with Japanese voices and lyrics.
  The characters are endearing and easily likable.  Ryo and his cohorts in crime(?) all have this sense of sly coolness and unbridled siliness.  A little bit of recognition has to go to Akira Kamiya, Ryo's voice actor.  He has been hailed as one of the greatest male voice actors of any anime and his extensive list of characters include Piccolo in ""DragonBall,"" Kenshiro in ""Fist of the North Star,"" Shun in ""Maison Ikkoku,"" and Roy Fokker in ""Macross.""  Just so you know.
  ""City Hunter"" is a delight for any anime fan, old and new.  It resonates with a timeless quality that few anime titles are imbued with today.  And since ADV will be releasing future episodes of this classic series in similar box sets, you can tell it is a very good investment.
  In closing, spend a viewing with ""City Hunter"" and you will get way more bang for your buck.

1877251,5,B000093NPY,"Originally started as a manga serial in Japan in the late 80's, the series, comprised of 36 volumes, was and remains one of the most popular mangas around.  The hero of the series is Saeba Ryo(wolf), a private  detective of sorts with a mysterious past, helping the weak in the urban  jungle. The character is a delightful mixture of martial prowess combined  with hard-boiled romanticism offset by goofy silliness. Although the hero  is a bit of the Japanese manga stereotype, the setting and plot of the  series, with its cast of supporting characters, manages to keep City Hunter  fresh and entertaining throughout.  This first installment of the anime  series as was aired on TV, even with its inherent handicaps due to 'limited  animation' production method of Japanese anime, is dynamic, trendy and  thoroughly entertaining. As it set the standard by which all subsequent  detective/action anime were measured, it is an absolute must for any true  anime afficionado.  By the way, pay attention to the theme song and the  background music. The soundtrack, by TM Network, was a huge hit.",963705600,,1091,5.016759776536313

1877308,4,B000093NPY,"I started watching this because of the lead actor that I saw in another Korean drama called Faith/The Great Doctor. First episode was all over the place, so I wasn't sure if I would continue watching this. Surprisingly after the first episode, everything got more interesting, and I had to finish it ASAP over the weekend. The series use very interesting cliffhangers that keep you on your toes until you watch the next episode. There are enough twists in the story that keep your interest all the time. Above all, you don't have to worry about inappropriate language or scenes, so you can enjoy with family members. The only drawback is reading the subtitles, but other than that this series is absolutely refreshing.",1388361600,,718,4.845528455284553
1877309,5,B000093NPY,"When I first started watching this, I did not think that I was going to make it through the first show!  Now I am a total addict.  I hope they continue it.  Is there any way of finding out if there will be another season?  I am only on episode 22 so I don't know if there is a grand finale or not, but I hope that it continues.  It seems to me that all of the actors are very good and the chemistry between the King and Queen and of finally Choi Young and the Heaven Doctor is fully out, it would be a shame for this to end.",1388016000,,524,3.727272727272727
1877310,5,B000093NPY,"probably the best Korean Drama i watched. when you think city huter most ppl think of the japanese anime with the guy who was a soldier in taiwan a merc who loves women and solves crazy problems with his awesome marksmanship and deep into being a funlike james bond PI/problem solver. etc. This is nothing like that. Still i was surprised, It has a very good story, pretty deep and it has some humor quirky moments action and suspense. its just damn well done. Worth watching imo",1385510400,,479,4.517241379310345

1877313,5,B000093NPY,"Wonderful cast,wonderful cinematography. Loved every second of this drama.
It is a nicely paced plot. Keeps you wanting more at the end of each episode.
It seems like a very cruel life this child was given.
Being stolen from his mother and raised to become an assassin.
Not only that,but become the assassin of his own father.
Lee Min Ho, is a very talented young actor.
I would recommend this to anyone interested in KDrama.",1382400000,,425,4.68

One of the best movies, TV Series I have seen in a long time.
Kept me up way past my bed time on more than one night, in fact I stayed up till after 5am just to see what happened next.
Really felt like you knew the actors and the part they played.",1379808000,,378,3.9220779220779223

1877358,5,B000093NPY,It was a awesome show an I enjoyed it very much. Thanks for the free premium month trial on Amazon.,1378425600,,99,4.0
1877359,5,B000093NPY,"I ended up watching all twenty episodes within the course of one week.  The main characters, City Hunter, Kim Nana,  and the ""evil"" father draws the viewer right in to the story.  It has something for everyone--romance, revenge, martial arts, crime fighters, and corrupt government officials.  It was interesting to see some of the culture, and translations in the Korean show.  For example, the two main characters shared one kiss during the entire series, yet the romance story line is a major theme.  The first episode is a bit slow,  but then the pace kicks into high gear for the rest of the shows.",1378252800,,603,4.740384615384615
1877360,5,B000093NPY,"It's got it all - cliff hanger action, romance, etc., along with a twisted story line that keeps you guessing what's next?  Except for the one obvious ""mystery"" - who is the masked man (e.g., Lone Ranger, Superman, Hannah Montana, etc.), there's enough mystery that keeps you on your toes.  I ended up watching again to pick up on the cues dropped throughout the series.",1377734400,,370,4.676923076923077
1877361,4,B000093NPY,"Simple, neat.. and focused.
I love the Season all the way.
But the ending could have had a little more sweet stories inbetween the 2.",1375142400,,133,4.36
1877362,5,B000093NPY,"I'm a huge fan of K-Drama. This is my all time favorite. I keep searching for a drama, Korean or American, which can match it. It has a great blend of everything I want to see in a great show!",1375142400,3,192,3.825
1877363,4,B000093NPY,An infant stolen from his mother is raised to be the instrument of vengeance against the corrupt officials and business leaders in Korea who were responsible for the murder of 20 of their own troops. Unless you speak Korean you will have to follow along with the English subtitles but this series has a great mix of action and romance. A man whose entire life is based upon nothing but lies must try to find the truth and  make the hard choices between vengeance and justice.,1375056000,2,475,4.523255813953488

1877366,5,B000093NPY,"This was a really good show. For me, it was like a 20+ hour movie that I loved. The only down side was, like all good things, it came to an end.",1371945600,2,144,3.53125
1877417,5,B000093NPY,"We are only one quarter of the way through the series and are addicted to it. Please tell us there is more than one season of this program!

The translation may not be perfect, but the episode plots are engaging and fast-paced. You'll get a glimpse of daily life and scenery in South Korea, too. Looking forward to seeing the entire season and hoping there is more to come.",1371945600,,373,4.405797101449275
1877418,5,B000093NPY,Awesome drama from Korea and i love this movie....i love it to much when i was in Viet nam then i come over here,1371945600,,112,3.7083333333333335
1877419,5,B000093NPY,"I am now addicted to Korean series.  The stories are excellent,  the actors are adorable and excellent and when each episode ends you can't stop watching because they leave you wanting more and the romance is just that...romance not porn.  How delightfully refreshing and truly entertaining because you cannot figure out what is coming next and it is always fascinating... If true romance, intrigue, drama, action with a little comedy is for you,City Hunter is it!",1371686400,6,464,5.078947368421052
1877420,4,B000093NPY,Loved the series!!  Kim NaNa is a too slow to be a body guard. More Kdramas please on instant video!!,1371686400,2,101,4.05
1877421,3,B000093NPY,"I would not say it was a great mini series but somehow I got hooked on the main character. He grows into a much wiser man as series progress and yet still naive and childish. his belief and  principle about life is sound and respectable.
The ending was somewhat vague and unclear. I would give it 3.5 but I had to give 3.",1370390400,,321,4.095238095238095
1877422,5,B000093NPY,"I started watching this because it looked intriguing and got addicted.  I do not speak any Korean so I have to remain in front of the TV to read the subtitles.  I've really enjoyed this, a classic battle between good and evil.  I was also delighted to see that Seoul is such a large modern city.  My previous knowledge of South Korea was old MASH episodes.  It's worth watching, I wish I knew a little Korean so that I could understand a least part of the dialog.",1369785600,,463,4.275862068965517
1877423,5,B000093NPY,"This piece has everything from action to zany characters.  Love, honor, family, political intrigue, patriotism, and revenge are spiced with twists and surprises.
The acting is sincere, making even the most unpleasant character have their human moments.  The action is quick and rarely, if ever, there simply for actions sake.
What made City Hunter a true gem is how the characters are truely endearing.  Some more than others, but even the most despicable of the corrupt politicians has a definable humanity.
The only issue with the series is the abrupt endings of the episodes. The streaming also doesn't have any end credits, but I am unfamiliar with usual Korean credits, so this may be normal.",1368489600,,697,5.043478260869565
1877424,5,B000093NPY,"First saw Lee Min Ho in the Korean Drama ""Faith/The Great Doctor"" he was really good in that, so I took the chance on this drama, had me on the edge of my seat. Really great show.",1365811200,,179,3.864864864864865
1877425,5,B000093NPY,"Don't miss this show, this show is worth watching. The main actor and the main actress is awesome. Go watch!",1365465600,,108,4.45
1877426,5,B000093NPY,One of the most entertaining shows I have seen in a long time.  It was much more involved than I thought it would be.  I did not mind the sub-titles in the least.  Laughed at some of the words that were used to make it understandable in English.  I understand that there is another season.  Come on Amazon and make it available!,1364515200,,328,4.225806451612903
1877478,4,B000093NPY,"The basic premise includes all the elements of Count of Monte Cristo - betrayal, survival, and a carefully planned retribution supported by new found wealth.  I'm not even half way through the season and I'm loving it.",1364083200,,218,4.891891891891892
1877479,4,B000093NPY,"Not a lot of gun fight, but every episode ends in a cliffhanger and that's good but also you should not start unless you have like 4 hours free otherwise you end up late for work the next morning haha",1363219200,,200,4.025
1877480,5,B000093NPY,"This drama has it all...a great balance of drama, action, comedy and romance.  It's the most exciting Korean drama series (or any drama series for that matter) that I've watched in a very long time.  Character development is deep and interesting, too, and it amazed me every time how much excitement they packed into every single episode!  And, of course, Lee Min Ho and Park Min Young were both awesome.  Will definitely watch this again and again.",1360627200,,449,4.792207792207792
1877481,5,B000093NPY,"This has it all. Action, drama, romance, comedy. It's a great Korean drama for those that are new to dramas",1360454400,,107,4.4
1877482,2,B000093NPY,I bought this thing it was dubbed in english. Instead it only has subbed in english.,1187654400,,84,4.3125
1877483,5,B000093NPY,"Okay; I became slightly obsessed with City Hunter during a summer abroad trip in Italy. I had only a semester of beginning Italian under my belt, but still found myself flipping through channels and channels of shows I could not comprehend. Then I happened upon City Hunter. The show was episodic enough that I could get a hold of the general idea of each show, but still I was confused about the more general things. What was City Hunter? Was he a private investigator? A professional assassin? Did he work for the cops? Also, who was this girl running around hitting him with a hammer? Was she a girlfriend, just a friend, a partner, what?

I followed the show, trying to make sense of it every day, until that sad day I had to come home. Imagine my jubilance when I realized I could buy it with english subtitles! Finally I would understand!

I was a little worried that once I knew what was going on, I would no longer like the show. Luckily, knowing what they all were saying had the exact opposite effect. The show is HILARIOUS. And depending on the episode, it can get really intense dramatically and violently. But the show is HILARIOUS. Watch it. And once you're hooked like me, you'll buy the other seasons as well, and get to see such great scenes as a man getting shot in the back...before f l e x i n g the bullets out. Really. It's hysterical.",1163030400,3,1357,4.424
1877484,5,B000093NPY,"I absolutely love City Hunter, since I first saw it on an Italian TV station a very long, long time ago.

Ryo Saeba is the perfect male character, and Kaori his best counterpart. They quarrel constantly, but when the time calls for it, they trust eachother blindly.

Watch the hammer and enjoy the ride. (The second half of the season is even better)",1107907200,,350,4.5396825396825395
1877485,5,B000093NPY,"First off, this series is Japanese with English subtitles - and that is the best thing ADV could have done.  No dub would capture the frequent changes between tone the characters all use.  But don't fret people City Hunter is a very visual anime with regards to plot and humour - even if you're slow at reading you'll keep up with this.  Previous dubs have all been terrible changing Ryo's name to Joe anyway...
Second the boxset features an introduction to words or phrases used in the show before each episode which really helps.
Thirdly the music in this show is great (the later boxsets of the series gets even better) and fourth this boxset is great value for money - it's half the price of a season of Tenchi or Trigun and less than Ranma or Slayers too.
There's no reason not to go after this boxset of the Mokkori maniac City Hunter's exploits.",1063584000,14,852,4.483870967741935

We really appreciate that these shows are very clean with no bad language and no porn sex scenes.  The entire family can watch these.  We also do not mind the subtitles.

City Hunter was a 5-star drama:  captivating, utterly engaging, full of action, suspense and pg-13 romance.  You have to follow the subtitles because if you don't speak/understand Korean you can't miss anything because then you'll be lost and not know what they're saying and/or is happening.

I would have liked more romance/love interactions with ""Kim Nana"" but I'm not sure if that's allowed in Korean dramas - more kissing scenes?  Also, although I loved this series, I would have liked a better and less vague ending.  Did he leave Kim Nana behind or stay with her?  What about the mom & the ""uncle"" person he lived with -- did they leave for US with him or without him?  I would like clarification because I like my endings wrapped up nicely.

I still think this drama deserves 5 stars and will watch anything with this actor!",1412553600,,1102,4.692708333333333

My favorite scene is the speech by the young injured soldier, Go Gi Wook, at his award ceremony, his final ""Allegiance"" and the attendees response.
More seasons may fill-in the questions left at the end.",1394236800,,413,4.956521739130435

7988846,5,B000093NPY,"If you want to watch a show that will keep you at the edge of your seat and wanting more, then this is the show for you. If you are feigning for a ""crack"" show that you will love even after time has passed, then watch this show!

You might not be into foreign films, or films where there are subtitles, but this one will make you rethink that notion. The fact that it is so captivating (not so much episode 1, as it is just the set up episode), will make you forget all your reservations.

Just a warning, before you start watching this, make sure you have cleared your schedule, because you will eat sleep and love City Hunter until the last minute.",1391126400,,650,4.192
7988847,4,B000093NPY,"I stumbled onto City Hunter thinking it would be a gritty thriller in the vein of ""The Chaser"" or ""Old Boy"" as I had just gotten into these Korean crime flicks and this was recommended. The first episode was promising, setting up an epic saga of power, corruption, betrayal, and revenge--but even in this one things turned pretty ridiculous fast. The setup: Lee Jin-pyo is the sole survivor of a botched attack on North Korea, but his colleagues weren't killed by the North, they were eliminated by the South who scuttled the mission midway. So what does Jin-pyo do? The logical thing of course: he kidnaps his fallen comrade's infant son (telling the widowed mother just to get on with her life), moves to Thailand, and becomes a drug kingin. He raises the boy, Lee Yun-seong, as his own, training him in martial arts, and sends him to Texas to get an advanced degree in technology. Then he unleashes this genius secret weapon to extract revenge on those who betrayed him so many years ago. Lee Yun-seong gets a job at a government security/technology firm (they seem to be a combination of the Secret Service and Microsoft) where he strikes up an antagonistic/romantic from afar with a young protection agent, Kim Nana. Meanwhile he reconnects with his mother, and plots revenge against the Korean power brokers who killed his real father with the help of Bae Man-duk, a man he saved his stepfather from executing back in Thailand.

This sounds all very tense, but what this really is is a fantasy geared at teenage girls. The protagonist is almost prettier than the women in the show and completely implausible as a kickass secret agent (he sometimes wears a mask which is about as effective as the Lone Ranger mask or Clark Kent's glasses). The secret service agents, especially Kim Nana, look like they're just out of high school and they act, dress, and live like they are in junior high. The plots are driven by wild coinicidences (If Lee is innocently with another woman anywhere in the city of Seoul, you can bet that Kim Nana will be walking down the street at the same time, leading to a misunderstanding between two people who purport to not be able to stand each other anyway). And again, these are all supposed to be adults with high powered government security jobs, yet they argue and act like sixth graders who think the opposite sex is ""icky."" Imagine if you will, Helen Mirren in Prime Suspect, with her hair in pigtails coming home to an apartment full of Hello Kitty paraphanalia. That's kind of the credibiltiy gap this show forces you to jump.

So why four stars? Because everyone is very likeable, it is clean, silly fun, and I'm enjoying it as a guilty pleasure. To be sure, if this were  done with an American cast I'd probably hate it--but the Korean setting and culture differences make it interesting enough to enjoy. I'm abouto halfway through, I'll probably regret it when I'm done, but I'm enjoying spending time with this goofy, adolescent revenge tale.",1389830400,,2986,4.727447216890595
