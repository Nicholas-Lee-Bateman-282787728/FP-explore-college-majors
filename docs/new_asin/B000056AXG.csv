8164502,4,B000056AXG,"The Three Mesquiteers, 1936 film

The movie begins in 1917 on a battlefield during The Great War. A headline reads Armistice. Troops march down a street with trolley tracks. Next we see a US Veterans Hospital. There is unemployment. The Government offers land to homesteaders in the west. The men agree, drive to the San Juan Basin in New Mexico. Lullaby is from there, he wears chaps and guns on his motorcycle. A man warns about these homesteaders, they are veterans and have government backing. Two men talk about the modern times of 1919. What did you put in my drink? One man tells the homesteaders to stay away. There is a difference of opinion. The other veterans roll into town. One man advises them to go elsewhere (he has an agenda). The wagons roll to their land. A landslide creates danger! Who would do a rotten thing like that? Canfields men drive off their horses. Lullaby arrives on his motorcycle.

The settlers build houses then celebrate. Bob sings Home on the Range. Lullaby handles a broom. They see a house on fire, then fire on the men there. Later Canfields men put Bob on a horse, an unhealthy action. Stony and Tucson ride into town. Stony asks for the sheriff, he says he knows who killed Bob. This causes shooting in the street by Canfields men. Lullaby shoots rockets to call for help. The veterans use pineapples to drive their enemies out. This ends the fight. Later Tucson tells Stony about 400 cattle stolen and a man shot. They leave to investigate, and Lullaby follows.

This movie must have been popular to create a series of sequels. There were other movies that followed this format of three pals working for a common purpose (Rough Riders, Range Riders, Texas Rangers). Robert Livingston played Stony Brooke (the romantic lead), Ray Corrigan played Tucson Smith (the older leader), and Sid Saylor played Lullaby Joslin (the comic character). This provided a range of entertainment that you would not get from a long heroic figure (Sam Spade). The recurring theme of saving small ranchers and farmers reflected the concerns of small business owners against being attacked by big corporations. Just like the small movie studios who were being attacked by the big movie studios and their chain of movie theatres.",1467676800,,2248,4.818652849740933
