8044985,5,B00076PAUM,"The reviewer who called this ""agitprop"" was spinning his own propaganda. In this movie, Ophuls uses his signature technique of letting the camera run on until the interviewees think the interview is over, and then they keep on talking, unguarded. Ophuls let his interviewees hang themselves, so to speak. This is simply brilliant film making, on a par with The Sorrow and the Pity, which the French National Front probably considers ""agitprop"" as well. In a public interview two months ago in Ireland, Bernadette Devlin McAliskey closed with these words, ""People have forgotten how to be brave."" Her bravery surely earned Ophuls's admiration, and what's so bad about that? I, too, wish this wouyld be re-issued on DVD.",1467849600,2,718,5.093220338983051
8044986,5,B00076PAUM,"I wish this would get a DVD release, it certainly deserves it.  Ophuls interviews numerous people from all social strata on both sides of the conflict in Northern Ireland.  I've seen it several times and would love to see it again.  'The Sorrow and the Pity', 'Hotel Terminus', and 'The Memory of Justice' are other of his films, I've never seen the last but the other two are great.",1368403200,3,383,4.521739130434782
8044987,1,B00076PAUM,"Ophuls interviews a number of Catholics and Protestants about the violence in Northern Ireland and is far from subtle about where he wants his viewers' sympathies to go almost to a point where it is insulting.  Bernadette Devlin and other Republicans are shown in a positive background and a positive light.  Ian Paisley and other Unionists are depicted as fanatics.  Thus, the film is so tilted in one direction that it is simply not informative.",1364342400,,447,4.933333333333334
