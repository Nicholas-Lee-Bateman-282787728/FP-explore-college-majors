7870655,5,6304415842,"This is a *GREAT* PBS series.  It is an interesting and moving series on American Poets.  The style (although dated in the sense of being non-techno) is really great.  It would be wonderful for a classroom.  Some  of my main associations with poets are from this series, and I think it was  the first time I heard some of the other living writers speaking (people  like Mark Strand, WS Merwin, Joyce Carol Oates, etc. are some of the  narrators).  Great, absolutely 5 stars.",952905600,,474,4.614457831325301
