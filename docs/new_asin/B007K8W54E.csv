5092910,3,B007K8W54E,"If you are a hardcore ""Last of the Summer Wine"" fan then this show is one that you will want to watch at least once.

The story line of this series is basically background on the major characters of Last Of the Summer Wine and in that sense the show is worth viewing but, overall the story lines are weak and at times actually confusing.  The scripts lack continuity in story line with some fairly significant inconsistencies",1366070400,6,425,4.5064935064935066

8518981,5,B007K8W54E,"For LOTSW fans, this is great! You will understand it all much better if you're already familiar with the characters. Included are Clegg, Foggy, Nora, Ivy and others. It's at least as good as the regular sitcom. Love it... but you need to be able to watch Region 2 DVDs in order to watch it. That is the tricky issue.",1521590400,,317,4.3
8518982,4,B007K8W54E,I wouldn't like this if it were not for the original series. The characters are not so lovable when young. In my opinion.,1470873600,,121,4.304347826086956

8518986,5,B007K8W54E,"I ordered this because I enjoyed Season 1 so much I wanted to see more. This is a region 2 DVD and will not play on my dvd player, but I bought an inexpensive external DVD drive for my computer and set the region for it to region 2 in the properties tab on my computer and it plays just fine with Windows Media Player.

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Last of the Summer Wine; sometimes I think it is even funnier than LOTSW! I wish they would have made more of these.",1394496000,,480,4.0
