8044737,1,B00008E2MZ,"Though the producers of this extended music video have created a red/blue product that LOOKS like true anaglyph 3D, it is not 3D.  Save your money.

9/28/05.  I just dug this out of storage and watched it again the other day.  Actually only the live footage even sort of looks like red-blue anaglyph and that's probably because of stage lighting!  Either the band thought that viewing anything through red-blue glasses made it 3-D or it is simply a marketing gimick.

Note to the band:  Some inventive video here, but next time use a Nu-View 3-D camcorder adapter (widely available for under $300) and make a REAL 3-D music video!",1100736000,4,630,4.724770642201835
