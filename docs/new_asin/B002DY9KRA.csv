A little drama, funny, witty and easy to watch.",1304553600,2,126,5.0
3913940,5,B002DY9KRA,I think Lovejoy is the best series ever.  I bought the product on eBay once and it didn't work.  But this one from Amazon is perfect.  Get it and enjoy it.  Lovejoy is intelligent and lots of fun.  I recommend this series highly.,1299196800,3,229,4.232558139534884
3913941,5,B002DY9KRA,"I'm just starting disc 2.  Its growing on me. Ian McShane is good, and his buddies on the show are a pleasure.  I look forward to seeing the occasional face that I have seen before on other shows and movies. I'm stretching it out, I only have time for an episode now and again, so I have a promising pile of programs ahead.  Those Brits are good.",1295740800,3,346,4.134328358208955
3913942,5,B002DY9KRA,"Lovejoy was one of the best television series ever offered on BBC and later shown in America. It had cult followings in both the UK and U.S. during its television showings. I watched almost every episode. Lovejoy (Ian McShane) is a ""divvie,"" a person who can instinctively tell if an antique is authentic and valuable without consulting books or doing research. The term comes from the word ""diviner"" and it's a talent that few if any others possess. With such a talent Lovejoy is a natural for the antiques business, but his several character flaws prevent him from making a fortune. Instead, this lovable rogue gets himself in situations that are humorous, mysterious, and often exciting. Sometimes these involve crimes committed by others or by Lovejoy himself! In other episodes, Lovejoy helps to solve curious mysteries or helps some person in distress who seeks him out. Wonderful old antique objects are always a part of the plot and Lovejoy is not above sometimes creating or improving these in ways that satisfy a customer, pay off a debt, or get hilarious revenge on an unscrupulous adversary.

Lovejoy's friends--Tinker Dill, Eric Catchpole, and Lady Jane Felsham--are also amusing, often hilarious. Tinker is Lovejoy's inebriated sidekick who knows quite a bit about the antique business himself. Eric's character is really funny: a sullen, sometimes resentful assistant whom Lovejoy does not always treat with respect but who's actions always gets laughs. Lady Jane is Lovejoy's wealthy but married female friend who likes to hang out with the lovable rogue; she often financially aids Lovejoy and willingly and sometimes unwillingly helps facilitate his plots. There is an ambiguity about their personal relationship that continues throughout the series. Are they interested in each other romantically or not? Lovejoy is set to get married to someone else in the final episode of the series but with hilarious results. In fact, both Lady Jane and Eric disappear as characters in Series 6.

All of the episodes in the Lovejoy series were shown on television in the U.S. during the 1990s. Current viewers may know Ian McShane only from his character in Deadwood or perhaps the short-lived Kings. McShane is a really fine actor who completely envelopes his character and creates very satisfying drama. If you love British drama such as the popular murder mystery series (Inspector Morse, Foyle's War, Inspector Lewis) or historical dramas (Reilly, Ace of Spies, Love for Lydia, Brideshead Revisited, I, Claudius) or comedies (Rumpole of the Bailey), you will certainly love Lovejoy. I always eagerly watched each episode.

Now that the series is complete, I highly recommend that you purchase this complete collection. It is encoded for Region 1 and was converted from its original PAL format in which it was created to the NTSC format used in the U.S. From reviews I have read, it appears the conversion was accomplished satisfactorily. The complete Lovejoy collection has been available in PAL format in Great Britain since 2004, so it apparently took five years to get the conversion done properly. You can buy the complete PAL Lovejoy, in All Region format, from Amazon.co.uk for the same price as here. If you have only a Region 1 DVD player as most of us do you in all likelihood cannot play PAL DVDs because of Region locking (not a problem with this PAL set since it is All Region) and because the great majority of Region 1 DVD players have had their PAL playback ability disabled. Also, most NTSC display devices cannot display PAL images. For U.S. customers, it is probably better to just buy this new NTSC set and not worry that the PAL set (higher resolution than NTSC and originally shot in PAL) is probably better and available at the same price. I haven't seen the PAL set so I can't personally judge.

Note: Do not buy the Lovejoy Christmas Specials DVD if you buy this complete collection as Amazon suggests in its ""Frequently Bought Together"" section. The Lovejoy Complete Collection already includes the two Christmas specials.

3913944,5,B002DY9KRA,"This series takes place mostly in England though there are occasional trips to other countries.
Lovejoy is one of the most charismatic characters I have ever encountered. He is a bit of a rogue, but charming and witty and all around entertaining. He is a fictional character that you will wish was real and one of your friends. He is fiercely loyal.
If you like antiques and history you will not only enjoy the series but learn something as well.
You will, as I said, fall for Lovejoy, but the other characters will capture you as well. This is a truly eclectic cast of characters.
I watched this series years ago on TV. Then I found it as a rental and was just as happy with the show this time. So much so that I have finally purchased the series.
You won't regret watching this thoroughly entertaining and informative series.",1271376000,7,827,4.52

3913946,4,B002DY9KRA,"Fans of rascally part-time detective Lovejoy (Ian McShane, most recently of HBO's Deadwood) will be thrilled with the recent release of Lovejoy: The Complete Collection. Containing every episode on 22 discs, this complete set follows the antiques dealer with ""a keen eye for beauty"" through more than 63-hours of sleuthing, sexing, and crime stopping in stores, auction halls, and stately homes in Britain. A popular series in the U.K., Lovejoy gained a cult following in the U.S., and now the entire series is available in one set.

Special Features

Lovejoy came before the days of DVDs, so extras are a bit limited. That said, die-hard fans will enjoy the included extras. An Interview with author Jonathan Gash is interesting (albeit not overly exciting), and explores the background for the show, stories, and characters, and how they developed. The real ""meat,"" however, lies in the two extras that focus on the star.

The Interview with Ian McShane and Gwen Humble is entertaining and funny, not only offering a take on what went on behind the scenes, but also revealing the impact the role - and series - had on the actors. This sentiment is continued in the third and final feature, Ian McShane looks back on Lovejoy Parts 1-6, allowing him to offer additional tidbits of trivia, behind-the-scenes ""secrets"" and his take on the show.

Although the price is a bit high (Lovejoy: The Complete Collection retails for $300) given the lack of special features, you can find it much more reasonable on Amazon.",1258934400,59,1512,4.9644268774703555
3913947,5,B002DY9KRA,"vey nice movie series, funny and entertaining. Season 6 is disappointing - I think the team bet on poor scenarists. Season 1-4 are great, decline starts from season 5 and season 6 is pathetic.",1518566400,,192,4.676470588235294

3913950,5,B002DY9KRA,"People living life with questions, discoveries, and issues. No violence. DVD quality very good.",1513036800,,95,5.857142857142857
3913951,5,B002DY9KRA,"There is some really excellent mystery and comedy and drama writing among the episodes of ""Lovejoy"". Lots of laughter and occasional ridiculousness. Not every episode has a body, but every episode has a mystery having to do with antiques, and I learned a lot of antique trivia along the way.

Lovejoy never introduces himself with a first name. No body ever calls him by his first name. Will we ever learn his first name? Teaser, in Season 3, he says to a woman, ""Pedrogao.... It's in Portugal. Thought we'd get married there. It's the only way you're gonna find out my first name.""

In his barn-cum-showroom, Lovejoy also cleans antiques. Sometimes he cleans them so well that a 19th century Bible box may end up a 17th century Bible box before it is sold. Caveat Emptor. He has several partners in crime, all differing personalities and all a joy to watch.

The characters are based on those in Jonathan Gash's ""Lovejoy"" mystery novels. I haven't read any of the books, but I've read that the book's characters are more violent and unlikeable than the more charming versions in the TV show. That's enough for me  I'll stick with the TV series.

The ""Lovejoy Complete Collection"" has every episode and both Christmas Specials, a total of 73 episodes (the specials were 90 minutes each). They total 64 hours of viewing, which means you'll be having a lot of chuckles. The 1st season aired January-March, 1996. There was a 4 year gap, and then the next 5 aired in 1991-1994.

The only things you're missing on the Complete Collection are the bonus extras which were added to the individual Season DVD sets:
...Bonus...""Ian McShane Talks About Lovejoy"" (55 minutes total) A 2004 interview with McShane, who plays Lovejoy, was divided into six parts. One part appears on each of the six Season sets.
...Bonus... ""Alan Titchmarsh Interview with Ian McShane"" (12 minutes) is included in the Season 3 DVD release. As Season 3 started to air, cast members appeared on the daytime talk show, ""Pebble Mill"". Dudley Sutton (Tink) and Chris Jury (Eric) appeared together, and Ian McShane and Gwen Humble (his real-life wife, who had a guest appearance) appeared another day.
...Bonus... ""BBC Interview with Ian McShane"" (12 minutes) is included in the Season 2 DVD release. This is Ian's guest appearance on the live daytime chat show, ""Scene Today"" and originally aired 1-28-91, when Season 2 had just begun airing. itself. Listen to this to hear a great story about Richard Burton, when McShane worked with him on a movie.

As this is an older show, the aspect ratio on the DVDs is still 4:3. Sound is stereo. English SDH subtitles are available. The only gripe I have with the Complete Collection is that there is no episode listing anywhere. Not on the box holding the six cases (one for each season). Not on the individual season cases. And not on the discs themselves. Would it have been so hard to add the episode names, in case you were looking for a specific episode? I have added brief episode descriptions to each of my reviews on the individual season sets, which might help you if you're trying to find something specific.

Happy Reader",1512777600,2,3138,4.766114180478821
3913952,5,B002DY9KRA,"Compared to present-day production quality, this would rank pretty low. But, it is not from the present day so I am judging it based on the time it has been plucked from. Given that, Lovejoy is top-grade!

What to expect? This is not an action-packed, suspenseful, show. Throughout these reviews I see words like delightful, charming, fun, likeable, light-hearted, breezy. You get the idea (I hope.)

Ian McShane is the heart of the show but the supporting actors also do a great job.",1509321600,,484,4.819277108433735
3913953,4,B002DY9KRA,"My wife and I originally became fans of this series back in the late 80s when it was imported by A&E, and always made sure to catch it or tape it. For many in the USA, this was their introduction to the delightful actor Ian McShane. We make sure to catch Ian in other shows and movies because of our appreciation for his work as Lovejoy, but truthfully we never like him as well in other roles ... the sometimes fate for an actor who makes a role his own over a long period of time. (Can anyone watch a current Tom Selleck role without comparing it to Magnum? Unlikely).

Lovejoy is a roguish and seldom successful antiques dealer in England who has a special quality to 'sense' if an antique is real or fake. For those more familiar with the books, his virtually psychic ability is played up more in the books than it is in the TV series, although it does make appearances from time to time in the shows. The TV series is also considerably sanitized over the content of the books, which have a lot more sex, mayhem, and out and out criminality on the part of Lovejoy himself ... although he always MEANS well. LOL

One major advantage of the TV series over the books is that you can always understand the endings. Gash from time to time dives into endings in his books in a very abrupt and chaotic fashion, and even though you somehow get the impression that everything worked out in the end, occasionally you're not certain of the mechanics of how it happened. And no, I'm not hopeless at reading comprehension, in fact I'm quite good at it. I'd say about one in four of the books have this problem.

As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the extras on the Lovejoy series DVDs are on the sketchy side. However, I don't really buy movie or TV show DVDs for the extras, I buy them to watch the movie or the TV show, so this isn't a great concern to me. If there are any interviews at all with actors or other interesting contributors, I consider it a plus, not a necessity of the format.

You aren't going to find a striking presentation of video or audio here, but what you'll see is almost certainly the equal (or better) of the original broadcast presentation, so no real harm is done. As a videophile, I would like to see flawless remasters in every product, but we just don't get that with some older TV shows and movies.

To my knowledge, Lovejoy hasn't been broadcast anywhere in the states since the early 90s, so if you are a fan wanting to revisit your pleasures of those days, or a potential new fan intrigued by the possibilities of the series, you'll have to buy them to watch them.",1508976000,46,2599,4.3615702479338845

Nothing offensive in this series! Love the English countryside & lifestyle shown in all its glory. The characters are likable and amusingly eccentric. Ian McShane, Lovejoy, is an Antique dealer who can tell if the ""antique"" is a fake at a glance. He's not beyond fixing up a piece and pawning it off himself. Having scrummaged around Portabello Road in London and attended country auctions I find this really entertaining.  I'm sure I've fallen for some knock offs myself!  The supporting cast is great. Love the ""partner"", Tinker, who dresses in wild 3 piece plaid suits and is always drinking in the local Pub. Lady Jane is the aristocratic wife of a wealthy philandering business man who is never around. Leaves time for her to flirt with Lovejoy. She is forever rescuing or bailing him out of trouble with a bit of cash. The apprentice is a heavy-metal fan whose father talked Lovejoy into teaching his son a trade. The stories range from forgery to murder.  The pacing is slower than today's shows. My Mom appreciates that the story follows a direct line and it's jumping back and forth into different time frames.

doesn't want to do another Lovejoy show or have any series of his own on the air. The entire cast was great in every season! The shows are
funny and well written with some mystery and you get knowledge of antiques and great view of England and other countries and houses etc..

3913984,5,B002DY9KRA,"Lovejoy was a moderately succesful British TV drama that ran for 6 seasons between 1986 and 1994 including two Christmas specials.
Starring Ian McShane as the titular character the show is very British, so may not carry mass appeal here in the states despite the popularity of Ian McShane in recent years in TV series like Deadwood, and Game of Thrones, and movies like Hercules alongside The Rock.
Nonetheless it still holds up well after 30 years!

For me personally, Lovejoy is very special. Not least because I was a rural postman in Suffolk where most of the first two series were filmed, and actually visited many of the filming locations, including frequent coffee stops with the family who's mail I delivered, who actually lived in the thatch cottage that was Lovejoys home in the first series. But also because I lived in East Anglia for over 20 years.

McShane plays a lovable rogue, an antiques ""divvy"" someone who instinctively knows whether an antique is real or fake, worthless or priceless, and is ably supported by his ""Barker"" and tout, Tinker played by Dudley Sutton, and Eric his student played by Chris Jury.
Each episode runs about 50 minutes, and is centered around the antiques trade in the East Anglia region of England.
Invariably there's a mystery to be solved, or scam afoot, and Lovejoy get's regularly embroiled in the plot with often funny results, as he rubs shoulders with aristocrats, and villains alike.
There's an excellent supporting cast, fans of Downton Abbey will enjoy seeing Phyllis Logan (who played the role of Mrs Hughes) as Lady Jane Felsham, A weekly regular who helps Lovejoy out of innumerable scrapes.

The whole series is a joy to watch, and true family entertainment. There's no real sex, violence or bad language, and it's very easy viewing.
In these days of binge watching TV shows in particular, this set is great to own and has every episode on 21 DVD discs.
Picture quality isn't fantastic, I don't think there will be a remastered HD Blu-ray copy out any time soon, but the older, almost a little grainy picture quality, almost adds to the whole experience.

Sure to be high on the list of anyone who was around in England (particularly East Anglia) in the 80's and 90's and remembers it the first time around, or even if you have just visited that part of the world.
Arguably the first two seasons were the best, as the years passed and a lot of original cast members dwindled, some could argue that the story lines got a little weaker, and even McShane himself seemed to be going through the motions a bit.

That aside, it's a great set to own.
At time of writing this review, it's just a sneak over $100 here on Amazon. It is available at considerably less (almost half that) on the Amazon UK site, but be advised that the UK set is Region 2 coded, and will NOT work on a US DVD player unless it has region free playback capability.

Below is a complete breakdown of the original episode airing dates:

The first series was shown on BBC1 in the first half of 1986. It concluded with a two-part special. Despite being a moderate ratings success, Lovejoy was not brought back until 1991. The original four cast members returned for the next two series between 1991 and 1992. With the start of the fourth series in 1993, Malcolm Tierney reprised his first series role as Charlie Gimbert.

During the fifth series, several cast changes were made. Phyllis Logan left the show in the second episode and Chris Jury departed in the sixth episode, although both characters returned for the sixth series finale. Two new regular characters were added: Lovejoy's new apprentice, Beth Taylor, and Charlotte Cavendish, who ran a local antiques auction house.

The sixth and final series of 10 episodes was aired between October and December 1994.
Two 90-minute Lovejoy Christmas specials were shown in 1992 and 1993.",1476230400,,3862,4.7522388059701495

I waited for years to watch it again in the order in which it was originally intended. It still proves true even now many years later. Lovejoy is still the art diva with an amazing natural gift of recognizing originals from fakes in the antique world and in all types of art media. He is surrounded by friends and peers of all sorts who, along with him, get themselves involved in all sorts clandestine adventures including theft, fakery, forgery, swindles and even murder at times. Prominent among these are Tinker, a true connoiseur of fine art and fine liquor, Eric, his novice assistant who is learning the antiques trade from the master, i.e. Lovejoy and Lady Jane, a friend Lovejoy would like to be more than a friend, who is his confidant and bank when he needs cash and chauffeur when he needs a ride.",1454284800,,924,4.538922155688622

3914007,5,B002DY9KRA,"This is a true eccentric British series that Ian McShane did a few years ago (cough cough) that truly captures the British ability to find mystery anywhere.  In this case with an Antique dealer, who in his pursuit of the classic and the profitable usually comes out on the short end of the stick involved in anything from smuggling from the Continent to murder most foul and everything in between.  Shane's performance and those of his superb supporting cast are spot on in keeping the eccentricity level high and the motivated mystery solver's interest at a boil.

I loved these when I first discovered them years ago (on PBS I believe...perhaps elsewhere...my memory not being what it used to be) and now that I've had a chance to watch the transfers (very good indeed with both picture and sound - the British always do these things right) to our format across the pond I have rediscovered why that was in the first place.  I think you will too if you're a follower of British mystery, a fan of Ian McShane, or just a simple individual who loves good entertainment.

I heartily recommend this series to you.  Enjoy.",1441584000,14,1118,4.649746192893401

3914015,5,B002DY9KRA,"Lovejoy ran for six seasons, 1886 to 1994, and caught the hearts of millions of viewers. The characters were ordinary people, always looking for an improvement in life, always struggling. Always funny. Humor mixes well with romance, suspense, sleuthing, and the overall over-riding factor is the antique world. It proved to be a winning proposition for the series and is just as contemporary today as it was 2 decades ago. It is one of my all-time favorite Brit TV series. Characters run from seniors, to middle age, to youth. Guest stars are a huge factor in the success of this series.

Regulars included Ian McShane as `just' Lovejoy, the antique dealer, so good he was considered a divvy (gifted antique spotter), but not afraid to bend the rules for a buck. He had more than enough love interests over 6 episodes but primarily it began with Lady Jane (Phyllis Logan -`Downton Abbey' as a younger actress) and ended with Charlotte (Caroline Langrishe -`Judge John Deed'). Always at Lovejoy's side was eccentric picker Maj `Tink'er Dill (Dudley Sutton -`Beiderbecke' trilogy) who had a nose for gems and a snoot of gin. An early assistant was Eric (Chris Jury who appeared in 55 episodes). He was eventually replaced with a young girl, Beth (Diane Parish) without the show's excellence being hurt. The excellence in plot, acting, guests, and writing made sure of continued success.
Owning all 6 seasons is a huge plus. The show ran for 73 episodes, thus the per-episode price is quite reasonable, considering the quality of the series.

Simply a very FUN entertainment. After the full run of episodes the viewer feels like part of the family. The guests seem like a Who's Who of the British Film world. The stories worthy of a second time around.

Some rooms have a lot of echo.

But these are what the British saw on TV, and that's what I hoped for.

For anyone purchasing a multi-region player, be aware that initial setup can be tricky. Mine did not even display the menu correctly until I followed the instructions in the manual. Once that is done, there are no further changes required to play any region.

Computer DVD players will play these, but there is a limit to the number of times you can alternate between regions. And you need player software that can do it.",1399334400,,815,4.606896551724138

This is a review of the Complete Collection which also includes the Christmas Specials. It is a 22 DVD disc set with 6 seasons of shows plus the Christmas Specials. They are all in seven plastic folders and a nice box. They will provide over 63 hours of entertainment, on a nice stormy evening for you, your family and friends. My discs and the box they came in were brand new and still in the original sealed plastic wrap.

Ian McShane stars as Lovejoy, an irresistible antique dealer, who is always on the look out for a ""find"". For those of us who are inexperienced in the mysteries of antiques a ""find"" is a genuine antique of merit with a history to back it up, which has been under priced by an uninformed seller. Lady Jane Felsham is a beautiful titled woman, played by Phyllis Logan, who is secretly in love with Lovejoy. Tinker Dill is a vastly knowledgeable but alcoholic picker played by Dudley Sutton, and Eric Catchpole, played by Chris Juryis, is an apprentice who is slowly learning the antiques business from Lovejoy.  Eric definitely shows more promise as a restorer than as a dealer.

Lovejoy scours all of the auction houses and dealer's shops within driving range of East Anglia looking for a find. When he finds one, by either being the successful bidder at an auction or making a deal with a seller, he often doesn't have the cash to pay for it. Then he makes a phone call to Lady Jane who usually bails him out. Lady Jane is not quite happily married; she respected her vows until there was evidence of lack of fidelity on the part of her husband, then she made a play for Lovejoy, who was uninformed about the details and missed the play altogether. Lady Jane was very disappointed and decided to move on.

Lovejoy is a dedicated antique dealer but more than that he is a genuine divvy. He is one of those very rare people who have a sixth sense that tells them when the object they are focused on, among the dross that usually fills auctions and antique shops, is a genuine authentic antique, with all of its beauty and loveliness intact waiting to be picked up, admired, loved, and removed to a place of safety and adoration. It is the only thing that trumps spending an evening with a lovely lady such as Lady Jane or the beautiful auctioneer Charlotte. Lady Jane returns in the Christmas Specials and there are implications that she may stay. (TV 1992) Lovejoy and Lady Jane go to Prague in search of the Monstrous known as the Prague Sun, which contains 6,000 17th century diamonds.

You really should buy this set of discs. You and your family will have so much enjoyment and fun watching them and reliving Lovejoy's finds and winnings. Don't miss out; when the current stocks of new complete sets are sold by all of the dealers the price for unused sets will get much higher.",1391990400,,2816,4.511764705882353
3914030,5,B002DY9KRA,"It took me three tries to get a decent set from Amazon of this series but it was worth the frustration since it is such a great show. Unfortunately, Amazon repackages used sets like this and sells them as new (regularly) and the first two complete sets that I ordered had many fingerprints and scratches on the disks, showing that they were definitely not new sets. The last set only had two scratched disks so I decided to keep it and I was able to see most of the shows. So be careful when ordering as any boxed sets may likely be repackaged even though they are sold as ""new."" I have been buying dvds from Amazon for years and this happens quite regularly.

As for the show itself, this is a really fun and interesting show with very likeable characters and varied plots that revolve around the antiques trade in England. The complete series allowed me to see the very early episodes as well as the later ones that came after breaks in filming.

but lovejoy series out-does them all. at first, seeing the first disc is a shocker as it shows 80s fashion in uk & this is jarring at first with video quality almost showing age. but the storytelling is first-rate  & almost more memorable than later years where fashion is less noticeable & production quality has clearly picked up.

as i write this review, i am watching the brighton episode. I love this as I will never see brighton but i get to see it watching lovejoy. & that is the charm of the show as it shows a contemporary UK with realistic brit characters vs historical uk.

also, one can learn a lot of antiques & forgeries & scams that can be pulled on you. so there is an educational component to the show that one can apply today to avoid paying high prices for antiques.

3914046,3,B002DY9KRA,"Ian McShane is a brilliant actor. We'd bought ""Deadwood"" and, even though we knew the show to be completely different, we assumed it would be the same quality. They had fine actors but the scripts fell short. The actors hadn't much to work with. Very disappointing - not to mention expensive.",1354060800,,292,4.745098039215686

3914050,5,B002DY9KRA,"Season 1 of this series is, indeed, delightful. However, Lovejoy was a novel thing -- an independently produced series produced in conjunction with the BBC, not BY the BBC. And as an independent production, there is a lot which they didn't quite get right in the first series.

Here are some of the odd and delightful things about the beginning of Lovejoy...

1. Ian McShane looks so young. By the time Series 2 rolled around five years later, he looks like the Ian McShane of Deadwood.

2. Was there ever a series that did so much location shooting? They barely built a set.

3. The quality of image here is dreadful. For a show that is about beautiful objects in charming locales, this is odd. Murky, dull, and totally lacking bright colors! The exterior shots in Venice (on the cloudy days) are particularly color-free. And a couple of shots of McShane in Venice on the boat are of extraordinarily low quality. What were they shooting this show with?

4. Boobs. A couple of shots of Boobs and a little bit of profanity.

5. It took Chris Jury more than half the season to begin to settle into his role.

6. For something in the mystery/thriller genre, some of the plots have sizable holes.

7. The credit sequence is the oddest credit sequence of all time. It acts as if the sequence is telling a narrative but is totally bonkers. (Why did the metal filings turn into dust? Is Lovejoy painting the painting? Is he bidding on the painting? His painting? The painting that symbolizes his life? Why did he break it? Who broke it? Etc.)

8. In every Series 1 episode, there is one supporting or guest-starring performance which is so amateurish that it is impossible to believe that a director or producer could ever look at it and say ""yea, well, that's good enough.""

Series #2 is a very different beast!",1331942400,,1805,4.577639751552795
3914051,5,B002DY9KRA,"A must have for Lovejoy/Ian McShane fans.  The complete series plus two special episodes.  Note that the last two discs contain what would be two seasons each, but these were shown in the UK in one year, so six discs contain all eight seasons.",1326499200,,243,4.5
3914052,4,B002DY9KRA,"I didn't see any reviewer mention one of my favorite features of this wonderful box set of the complete series of Ian McShane's 'Lovejoy.' Having watched the first few shows and thoroughly enjoying them, I had only one small issue with them, the audio quality. It may be my television but I don't think so since most all my other DVDs are fine in this regard, but for some reason these DVDs are 'soft' in the audio and I have to turn my TV up all the way in order to hear it well. Also, the characters on the show use phrases that may be familiar to residents of the UK but many times things were said that, although I heard them alright, I couldn't understand what was meant because some form of English slang was being used and often times I couldn't understand what was said at all because the audio quality isn't the greatest. At least not on my set of discs. This is the reason I gave this four stars. But... then I discovered a feature that made me enjoy these already delightful episodes even more - the subtitle feature.

Now, I turn that feature on before watching each episode and it's so much more entertaining since I now can read what's being said at all times and understand exactly what's going on without having to say, ""What did he say?"", rewind it and listen to it again more closely! Love it! This is a great show and I'm now into the second season. Viva, Lovejoy!

Peace.",1318982400,,1391,4.346153846153846
3914053,5,B002DY9KRA,"Lovejoy reminds me of a period where antiques are rediscovered and valued for the joy and love they were created with. The passion that the craftsmen used when they designed and formed articles that would be fought and sought after for hundreds of years in the future would create a wealth of stories that become ""Lovejoy"". He is that person that each of us has a desire to be, the ""Discoveror"", ""Robin Hood"" and a great ""lover"" of all that is ""life"" and precious. Together with his ""band of men"" he sets out to discover the treasures of life and right the wrongs of deeds cast through the wide range of society. He cannot walk by something of beauty, he has to reach out and explore and touch and feel it's unique value and the love of its being. As in life nothing good comes easy and so it is with Lovejoy where many search for unique items from our past and seek the joys these items bring, along with the competition to aquire those treasures. With his unique skills he is like a ""street fighter"", quick and has an amazing ability to get out of ""sticky"" spots while able to ""right"" many wrongs he comes accross, usually without any material gain to himself. His many real loves of life are just out of reach, but he does strive for Passion that is deep in his soul, his attraction for that thing of beauty just out of his reach.",1311033600,5,1333,4.357429718875502
