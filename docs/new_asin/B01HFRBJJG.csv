8765351,5,B01HFRBJJG,"Great performance by Lindon.  Couple of almost comical scenes in which his character is stretched to the limit in what he can endure (i.e. having to sit quietly while being ripped by job-club peers for mock interview performance; having to dance with an effeminate instructor, etc).  I should point out this is for lovers of good films; not for ADD-riddled-brained, cell phone/social media addicted imbeciles (i.e. 85% of the general public now).  For these individuals, stick to mainstream Hollywood crap.",1510617600,,506,5.3
8765352,5,B01HFRBJJG,"One reviewer lamented the name change for this, from something like, 'Market Forces' to 'The Measure of a Man'. Either choice had merits, but the latter might be more classic.  My first take is that this is film which deals with a man's struggle to maintain dignity in the face of opposing forces.  One might take all sorts of things from a film, at the very least the takeaway here is that life is not a joke. Not all will feel rewarded for watching this.  I did.",1494201600,,464,4.310344827586207
8765353,5,B01HFRBJJG,"A very ""small"" film.  Lindon is wonderful in an understated performance of great depth.  No car-chases.  Not for everyone.  I loved it.",1481155200,,135,5.0
