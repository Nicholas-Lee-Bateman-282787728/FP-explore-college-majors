8427202,5,B004ELAF5Q,"I recently saw my first Chaplin movie and I was immediately hooked.  I think I have everything he has ever done now, including his autobiography.  He was an amazing artist and a very interesting man.  Not many people can make me laugh out loud, but some of his movies either just amaze me, or they make me cry laughing.  The DVD arrived on time and in perfect condition.",1350345600,6,370,4.397058823529412
