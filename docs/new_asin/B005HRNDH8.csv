4703000,5,B005HRNDH8,"This is not just yoga, this is beautiful yoga. I purchased mine at one of Kate Potters yoga seminars in Colorado. She is an amazing, calm, soft spoken person who just puts you at ease. There are many levels of yoga on this dvd so it is good for young and old, experienced, and those new to yoga. Thanks to yoga practice I am one of the most flexible grandmas I know! I don't ever remember seeing my grandma on the floor unless she was washing it. Thanks Kate!",1318982400,3,459,4.168539325842697
4703001,5,B005HRNDH8,"This set of DVD's is fantastic. It flows so well from beginning to end. It really helped me tone my muscles and create a long and lean look (and get rid of excess baby weight). There are 13 episodes, so you never feel like you're doing the same thing over and over. So relaxing and fulfilling. I had to order these DVD's when we were no longer able to view it on TV and I'm so glad I did! Easy to follow, yet still a great workout! You won't be dissappointed.",1318896000,,459,4.054945054945055
4703002,5,B005HRNDH8,"I am a new yoga instructor. I have practiced yoga since I was 12 but I just started instructing in 2009. I came across the Namaste program by watching Fitv. It has increased my flexibility, stamina, strength, health and well being. I had high blood pressure that was uncontrollable with meds until I began practicing with the Namaste program. Now my blood pressures are down lower than ever! Thanks, Kate Potter!",1318550400,,412,4.816901408450704
4703003,5,B005HRNDH8,"I have bought several yoga dvds in my time, only to find that they are boring, the music irritating and the voice over annoying. The Namaste series is simply perfect. Kate's music and voice are the most soothing I have ever heard- if the savasanas were longer, I could easily fall asleep. I first saw an episode on FitTV when I was sixteen years old- and here I am, five years later, still hooked. I have both seasons and owe most of my yogic knowledge to them. They definitely helped me get back into shape after my first baby, and have kept me agile and flexible while pregnant with my second (I am 37 weeks along and can still perform most sequences). The scenery is breathtaking as well. Thanks for a great series, Kate! Hopefully there is more to come!",1318550400,,757,4.414285714285715
4703004,5,B005HRNDH8,"I've got more yoga DVDs than sense...I always have high hopes and am frequently disappointed by bad editing & choppy sequences. A friend recommended these and I am in her debt! The photography is magnificent...not only the exteriors but the body shots of poses are perfect. You get complete flow throughout the sequences even if the locale has changed. These are the only yoga DVDs I own where I get a true sense of a practice, from beginning to end.

I've read elsewhere criticism of how young and beautiful the women are. They are lovely but they are 100% committed to the discipline. I like that the DVDs show multiple practitioners and allow you to see variance in form.

There are poses that I never understood (even in class) until I saw them on this DVD set. The camera serves as no human eye could, delivering every view possible. Kate Potter's narration is flawless.

I now use these DVDs for my home practice. I could not be more happy with them and recommend them highly.",1318377600,96,982,4.6
4703005,5,B005HRNDH8,"Basically, I was looking to try yoga for some time but never really had a chance. One day I was flipping through the channels, and saw this on FitTV, watched an episode, and have been hooked ever since. There are two seasons of this show (each with 13 episodes) and a special other DVD. There is a lot to like here. These are the best Yoga DVD's I've ever seen, I love them dearly, and I plan to explain why. Granted, I still prefer real class, but these dvd's are the best I've found for a home practice. I honestly, cannot praise this show enough.

First, the visuals in this show are really appealing. Unlike a lot of other yoga and fitness DVD's I've tried, these aren't set in a studio with people poorly trying to guide you. The women in these DVD's practice in a few different locations (visually stunning ones at that), and the voice over does a good job guiding you through the poses and also instructing you on the poses. The locations as well as the voice over are very soothing, and help to keep you focused without you even really noticing.

Second, the time of each sequence is about 23 minutes, which is what the half-hour show is cut down to without commercials. It doesn't seem like that long, but you really feel it. It breaks down to a short warm up, the proper sequence, which is always 12 minutes, then a cool down and a brief savasana. I love this time frame for when I want to get something in, but don't have the energy for a really lengthy routine.

Third, the poses are again some of the best I've seen on a DVD. There are the easy, and staple, poses such as Warrior 1, but there are also more advanced poses such as Crane. The poses vary for each sequence, and if you buy all three sets, you have about a month's rotation if you do one a day. I've found that this stops me from getting bored and stopping. This is my one real complaint really, is that I wish there were even more poses. However, the ones on the DVD's are more than what any other DVD I've seen offered, so it isn't much of a gripe. Maybe there will just be more seasons yet to come.

I would recommend this show to anyone who loves yoga, or anyone who is interested in giving it a shot. The relatively high price tag is well worth the price.",1318118400,103,2235,4.23943661971831
4703006,5,B005HRNDH8,"As a child I would do certain stretches that felt good to me and eventually took dance class until I was 18.  Still stretching here and there on a day to day basis just felt right.  I decided to try some yoga and never found one that I liked, it didn't feel right, either you would just lay there and move from time to time, or the others consisted of arm balances which i didn't have the strength for nor did it make me feel stretched or relaxed.  I stumbled upon Kate Potters Namaste Yoga and never stopped doing yoga again  It flows and makes me feel relaxed, toned and confidant.  Confidence has a lot to do with the way you carry yourself and my posture has become noticeably better, plus the fact that I feel better about myself and have a reason to get up in the morning. These DVD's have also changed the way I looked at life in general. The dynamic flow literally helps me deal with whatever comes up throughout my hectic day. I can't wait for Kate to bring another series to us.  I have all of them up to now.  Also, she is personable, I emailed her and she personally emailed me back several times
The best yoga DVD series to date.

4703007,5,B005HRNDH8,"It's expensive compared to many other yoga videos, but so well worth it, and a bargain if you ask me. You get thirteen 25-minute practices, and most videos only give you a couple. But that's not why it gets five stars from me. It is by far the best yoga sequencing for beginners and advanced that I've ever seen in video form. I cannot recommend enough!",1502582400,,353,4.363636363636363
4703008,5,B005HRNDH8,This entire series of DVDs is absolutely amazing!!! I&apos;ve been doing yoga for close to 20 years... with these I get the dynamic flow with some advanced postures that I&apos;m used to from doing Vinyasa yoga.... But without having to go to a class to get it.... which is truly fantastic!!! Would 100% recommend this entire series to anyone wanting to do Vinyasa Yoga without leaving home!,1501891200,,391,4.850746268656716

4703010,1,B005HRNDH8,"I guess if your intention is to quickly lean the poses, in speed mode, and then practice later, this would be an okay disk set. I don't care for it. They only give each pose 1-3 seconds, so there's no real workout. I've always learned that each pose should be maintained for a minimum 30-40 seconds. There's no real benefit from this disk, unless you don't mind studying it, writing down the sequences and practing later.",1493596800,7,421,4.552631578947368

4703014,3,B005HRNDH8,This is a good dvd for folks that are familiar with yoga.  I would not recommend it to a beginner because there is not a lot of teaching/instructions for the poses.  I would give this a higher rating but my dvd skips in multiple places.,1490832000,2,236,4.222222222222222

I am getting back into yoga after being away from it for two years for health issues.  Now I am recovered and healing and this little gem of a DVD is getting me healthier on all levels.

4703019,5,B005HRNDH8,"Love these videos!  They are about 20 minutes for each workout on the video (13 videos total).  This allows a quick workout that is different each time.  It's easy to get this done even if you don't have a lot of time to spare (and you don't have to drive anywhere to do it).  I have been able to do this a minimum of 5 days a week with no issue and my body is very toned and strong as a result.  Some videos are more difficult than others, but as you do them more than once they will become easier over time OR if they are too difficult you can skip to one you find works better for your body.  I encourage anyone who has been looking for something to do for their health to try these videos out.

4703032,4,B005HRNDH8,"When I first started this series, so many things about the production bothered me. Why the long intro for such a short workout? Why is it split into three separate sections with long transitions in between rather than one long scene? Why the weird close ups and zoom arounds that make it hard to see what the women are doing? Why use weird names for established yoga poses (e.g. cat lift instead of cow)? And who does yoga with their hair down?!

Looking past these annoyances, I like the way the poses flow together and I feel rejuvenated after completing a session. I really enjoy the cool down stretches, but I do think some variety would be nice. I prefer Rainbeau Mars (or a yoga studio even better), but these are a nice alternative.",1481414400,,739,4.514925373134329

4703039,2,B005HRNDH8,"I am not sure what all the hype is about with this series.  The narrator is hard to hear, the routines flow quite quickly making it challenging for those who are older or not flexible and it is uncomfortable to watch as most of the women under-dressed.  My least favorite yoga DVD.  I am over 40 so perhaps this appeals to a younger crowd.  I would call this ""flow yoga"" and not a stretching yoga series.",1469577600,14,404,4.276315789473684

4703046,4,B005HRNDH8,"I have made it through the first disc of this two disc season and have so far enjoyed it (with a few reservations I will outline shortly). I am relatively new to yoga but have not had any difficulty with poses and I find the sequences pretty interesting.

The videos are structured in a three-part warm up, sequence, cool down structure. The warm up and cool down are essentially the same in each episode with the sequence changing each time. Given that the main sequence seems to be about 12 minutes, it does feel like the workout is rushed (I'm guessing it was designed to fit in a 30 min TV spot with commercials). In addition, while the cinematography is pretty, it isn't necessary focused on showing you how to the pose. Instead is seems more interested in close up panning over the women doing the poses. For that reason I usually do the main sequence once with video, pause it while I go over the sequence again, and then proceed to the cool down.

I think this is a good purchase that would be even better if they slowed it down and focused less on the ladies and more on the yoga.

Pros
*Interesting poses and sequences
*Beautiful scenery

Cons
* Sequences are too fast for a beginner to follow without either missing the pose or pausing
* Seems a little too sexualized from the ""knowing looks"" to the zoomed in body pans that don't actual show you how to do the pose. (I may be making too much of this, but my wife and I always have a good chuckle when we do the videos together)
* The narrators tone takes a few episodes to get used to.",1464220800,23,1547,4.324137931034483
4703047,3,B005HRNDH8,"Every style of yoga is different. The key is to find the right one for you. This one is...well...interesting.

The flow is much faster than I expected, there's almost no hold in position, just constant movement. The verbal cueing is rapid, almost machine gun fast. The visual cueing isn't exactly helpful, as the camera is often zoomed in tight on one of the girls' body parts. (Now, I'm secure in myself, so I'm not offended or bothered by the ridiculously good looking, scantily clad trio of bendy girls. But come on...the obvious hard nipples poking through the teeny tiny yoga bra is a tad distracting, even for me and I'm straight.) And yes, as noted by other reviewers, some of the names used for poses are non-traditional. So if you're looking for a more traditional yoga style, that flows gently with helpful cueing, providing both verbal and visual explanation of positions...this is not it. If you're open to doing something a little different, don't need a whole lot of cueing, are willing to learn new names for centuries old positions (without too much eye rolling) then sure, give this a try. Or...if you just want to watch sexy women in minimal amounts of clothing as they bend and twist their supple bodies while having physiological reactions to the cold environment, then definitely give this a whirl. Just be sure to close the door. And wipe up when you're done.",1463616000,12,1381,4.7782426778242675

Each episode comes with a warm up, main sequence and a cool down. Each main sequence lasts around 12min and consists of basic poses that build on each other. The yogi are not distracting and they are motivating to look at. The decor is not overwhelming nor distracting. As I do them frequently, I get to know the poses faster without depending on the screen.

4703052,5,B005HRNDH8,"My favorite yoga series. I found this when we had satellite TV. I had tried the other shows but thought they were too fast, too boring and/or too hi level for a beginner like me. I never thought of myself as one who'd be into yoga, and really, I'm still not. However, I had been doing marathons and having to deal with so many injuries. When my physical therapist recommended yoga, I thought it was worth trying. I like this series in particular because it was my warm-up before my runs, especially my long training runs that would begin even before the sun came out. It provided the stretch I needed so early in the morning when I was still trying to wake up. The movements, the setting and narration were so soothing that it did help me slowly awaken. We no longer have satellite TV so now having to purchase the DVDs before beginning to train for another marathon.",1461456000,,867,4.425
4703053,5,B005HRNDH8,"I have fallen in love with yoga over the last year or so. I started due to back pain and have really grown to enjoy it. The main way I get my yoga in is through classes, but some days that's not an option, so I have a healthy stash of yoga DVD's for those hectic days. Namaste yoga is at the top of my list for a nice, quick, effective practice. This first season is excellent! Here's a few reasons I love it:

-Time: Namaste yoga is the only DVD that has shorter sequences, most of my other DVD's range from 45 min to an hour. Some days I just don't have time for that. I have two busy kids that require a lot of my time. These practices are all about 23 minutes, that includes a warm up and cool down. Even on my busiest days I can almost always squeeze one in. If I have a little extra time I'll put together two main sequences for a little extra boost.
-Narration: This seems to be an issue with some people. These DVD's don't go in depth on how to do poses and breathing. This may be a positive thing for some and negative for others. I get very annoyed with my DVD's that go through every aspect of a pose. If I do the same DVD over and over it becomes so repetitive. I've been doing yoga for long enough that I don't need someone to talk me through how to do downward facing dog or warrior II or most other poses. When I watch a DVD that has too much narration it lessens the tranquility of the practice for me. That being said, if you need guidance on how to do poses or modifications, this may not be a good DVD to start with. I really enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rodney-Yee-s-Yoga-for-Beginners/dp/B001F76OKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners</a>&nbsp;to help me learn exactly how to do various poses and what I'm supposed to be doing with the pose.
-Scenery: This is absolutely my favorite aspect of this. I love the beautiful locations they filmed this in. There's beautiful locations like a forest, park, old ferry terminal, dock and even a night club. It's all done so tastefully with seamless transitions between the scenery. It really helps me find peace within my practice. I am astonished at how wonderfully it all is made.
-Practices: Last but not least, the sequences in the DVD are excellent. The menu has a brief couple word description about what the focus is on. The sequence will be centered around that aspect, with other stuff added in. For example, my favorite sequence on this DVD is ""Crane"". This focus on what I know as ""crow pose"". It flows through a nice practice with a focus on crow, but also has some Warrior III poses in there and a some others. It is my favorite because I'm working on building upper body strength and balance on my hands, with a hope of being able to do a handstand in the near(ish) future.  This does move faster than some of my other DVD's. Given the length of these I understand why, but if you prefer to hold poses for longer, rather than flow through at a faster pace, this might not be for you.

Overall, this is an excellent set of DVD's. I love the variety of sequences, the narration being minimal and the length being manageable for a busy mom. I was sent these for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on my rating or review of them, this is my honest opinion.",1460419200,,3319,4.464579901153212

4703058,3,B005HRNDH8,"MAN! I know these are meant to be done in the morning so people may want a quick session before starting the day, but these videos go SO FAST.  I like yoga to be a nice mix of workout and relaxing/rejuvenating - I was strangely stressed doing these videos feeling like I couldn't keep up through the breathing and poses.

I don't know how these are rated, but I would consider them intermediate level, only because they don't truly walk you through what each pose is, you're more expected to know the names of poses.

There's a lot of variety on these discs and when I'm in a hurry, I use them, but otherwise I have other options I enjoy more for my practice.",1456099200,7,659,4.298387096774194

I'd had dozens of them over the years, searching for just the right one. THIS is the right one. It's done beautifully. The camera angles allow you to see how to do each step. They move smoothly. The work out at every level is excellent. The scenery is calming. Even the voice of the narrator is absolutely perfect. If you've had a dozen or so yoga DVDs, then you know that the voice of the narrator can be annoying and make you not want to listen to it This narrator - whom I believe to be Kate Potter herself - is truly enjoyable, soothing and right in keeping with the gentle, healing nature of yoga.",1455408000,,710,4.266666666666667

The first pose on the first lesson of the first disk (one would think should be easy at this point, right?), I couldn't do.  It is a cross-legged sitting and then twisting position.  I'm not flexible enough to be able to do that.  If you already have experience, this does seem to be a quality in-home instructional series.

If you want to learn some simple yoga, if you want to be inspired by great scenery and talented yoginis (SP?) going through sequences, do yourself a favor and get the first two seasons!  It's not quite perfect, but that is the fault of the editor.  It's helpful to see the transitions between positions.  All too often the editor transitions between shots as the youginis are changing position.  While sometimes annoying, it is not a major problem (hence the five stars)... in these seasons.  One thing that would have made this even more beautiful is if the producers had shot  and offered the series in high definition.  Maybe someday?",1424822400,3,700,4.7272727272727275

What I love it each session is about 20-25 minutes long, which is perfect for my busy schedule.  There are interactive backgrounds that keep me completely visual engaged and interested no matter how many times I watch each session.  The sessions are challenging without being too much so - I would say this is for beginner to intermediate level yogis.  It is helpful if you know proper alignment prior to start, since this session is more about the flow and movement rather than the alignment.  After i complete a session I feel renewed and relaxed.

I am looking forward to purchasing season 2 as soon as I commit all of season 1 to memory.  The only down side is I want to buy all of the model's outfits in the sessions!

I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to practice yoga at home who has a busy schedule who already has had experience with yoga in the past.",1418428800,3,1108,4.208530805687204

4703099,2,B005HRNDH8,"The good:  As a red-blooded man, I appreciate the swirling close-ups of the barely-clothed toned bodies of the attractive young women.  Also, the background scenery is very pretty.

The bad:  Due to the swirling camera, it's actually somewhat difficult to see what's going on.  I've looked up to understand the pose, only to see an extreme close-up of some woman's belly - not real helpful.  I find myself hitting rewind multiple times, just so I can understand what she's trying to say.

Although I've been practicing yoga for 14 years from a wide variety of teachers and videos, I frequently have no idea of what the narrator is saying.  She whispers everything, and apparently makes up her own names for established yoga poses.  (It's Cat and Cow, not Cat and Cat Lift!  There is no such thing as Cat Lift, or Cat Bow!  It's Standing Splits, not Needle!)

Also, the essence of yoga is breathing.  This style requires constant movement, and so guided breathing is even more important than it usually is, but the postures here are done with very little comments relating to breathing.  It should be ""Inhale as you do this, annnnddd... exhale as you do this"", but that's not the way it happens.

Very disappointing.  I have lots of yoga DVDs, and this one is near the bottom of the barrel.",1415577600,86,1289,4.6875

This DVD is quite different.  The girls are in almost constant motion.  You really need to stay alert in order to follow them.  But each time it gets easier until you start to feel a certain mastery.  It's rewarding a not painful at all.  Almost not at all.  In any case, I don't see any way to pull a muscle with this.

I like the voice over.  Very soothing and the instructions are explicit.  I like that each position has a name.  Once you make the association you can just listen to the voice and not watch the screen.

I also like the length of each segment.  Not too time consuming.

Now, 6 months since the purchase, I have joined a yoga studio and do flow yoga there one lunch per week, I got the second set of disks and added them to my repertoire.  Then I started meditating on my commute into work (I commute by ferry so have some space and time).

4703132,4,B005HRNDH8,"Along with throngs of NY resolution makers, we wanted to purchase some in home DVDs to do exercises at home. We have gone through 3 of the discs over the last week and have been pretty satisfied.

The moves are easy to follow, the voice guidance is clear and soothing, and the music very relaxing.

My one gripe is that the pace of going from one pose to another is pretty rapid, and the duration that they hold each pose is fairly short. I am by no means a yoga expert, but have taken a variety of yoga classes from an entire semester in college, to classes at the gym, but they have always been slower. I'm sure once we get used to the poses and don't need to look up at the screen, adjust our body, match up breathing, and can just go off the voice guidance alone, it might feel less rushed.

Great for beginners, and as it get easier put more mind, breath, and stretch into it.  The sitting practices build your strength so the standing poses will be easier for you.  It can be as easy or as challenging as you want it to be.  If you find it difficult in the beginning remember your breath is the most important, so focus on that.  Proper breathing is one of the healthiest things you can do.  If you are very out of shape, just breath with them and watch the poses so you know what they will look like when you can add them in.

I tried really hard to find this series after that channel went all crazy and I'm so glad I was finally able to purchase it here.  The price could be a little less and I think it did drop from when I purchased it, but for all the episodes you're getting it's worth buying.  When I was hurt at work I was still able to exercise and destress myself by doing some of these episodes and I've added one episode before and after to my work out schedule as I find it gives me energy.

The episodes themself are very easy to follow.  The second disc does contain some harder to follow yoga poses like the crane and one where you roll, but that's maybe one-three episodes out of thirteen I believe that might give some people problems.  The cool down stretch is about the same for every episode as well, so if you want to do more than one episode you can skip it and just go to the individual options for any other episode.",1374019200,7,1008,4.143589743589744

4703156,5,B005HRNDH8,"What it is: At 25 minutes each, the routines are the perfect length for my hectic mornings - short enough to get in, but long enough to feel like I've got a complete workout. Each segment has a warm up, an interesting and creative dynamic flow, and cool down with stretches and shavasana. I've suffered through enough ugly and shoddily produced yoga dvds to appreciate how beautiful this one is - gorgeous interior and exteriors that flow as gracefully as the poses. With 13 segments, there's plenty of variety - two weeks worth of morning routines.
What it is not: An instructional dvd. No time is spent on form or mechanics, and the pace is brisk, so if you are new to yoga and do not already know these poses, I can see these routines being the cause of some frustration or even injury. It is also not a deep stretch/relaxation flow, or an intense heat-building power flow - it's too short for either. But for my purposes on work day mornings, it's great.",1369180800,4,958,4.511494252873563

I have resisted buying the dvd's because they're so expensive, but even though I own a lot of great yoga dvd's (all of Shiva Rea's) I always go back to the recorded show. Sometimes I want to do something a little softer and the namaste series is perfect when I don't have a lot of time or the energy to struggle with difficult poses. This series is very meditative and works you in a way that sort of sneaks up. You think you're getting off easy but by the end there's a definite shift. It's nice to do in the morning before going to work, and I'm glad that I finally broke down and bought this first season, it's great not to have to forward through television commercials.

4703163,5,B005HRNDH8,"Before purchasing and using this yoga DVD, I had only watched and tried a few poses and was bored stiff. I thought the only way to get a work out was by sweating ferociously or by exercising in a way that would negatively impact my joints. I admit I was wrong - it is truly invigorating and will continue to do it for the rest of my life! I am most definitely a beginner at the age of 38 - I chose to do this because I am trying to get away from high/moderate impact (even walking!) due to pain and crepitus in my knees and ankles.

I am currently 2 weeks into this DVD. So I am still considered a newby. This DVD was very instructional (got to the point after a few episodes I could do what she was saying without having to watch) and very clear. At times, she misses an instruction, but I know what is going to happen so it isn't always necessary. I read a poor review because someone couldn't tell what to do because the cameras focused on a person's face instead of the pose. I found this only with one pose (the Monkey Pose) at one time - if you pay attention, she tells you exactly what you should be doing. There are times that the sequences are fast but it is all about fluidity. I appreciate that and it's not boring. Honestly, if you have ever done a workout DVD before, it is COMMON to get lost at first, until you do it enough to get the hang of it. This is actually so much better than anything I had ever done before.

Another thing I enjoy is that the entire DVD is broken up in episodes then each episode is broken up again into a beginning sequence, main sequence, and cool down. I like it that I can add more to my workout: I do a beginning sequence, 3 main sequences and cool down. Instead of a 20(ish) minute workout, I do so for about 50 minutes.

4703176,1,B005HRNDH8,"Ok, so this is the very first time that I have ever written a review on any product on any website, but I feel the need to address this issue:
I purchased Namaste Yoga: Season 1 and 2 for a Christmas present to myself.  Both DVDs came in a timely manner, except Season 1 seemed to have gotten damaged through the mail.  I could actually see a hole through the packaging, into the DVD which made the DVD loose in its case to roll around through the entire mail delivery.  Scratches everywhere on one of the DVDs.  I was pretty bummed about this because I wanted to start the Season 1 obviously before Season 2 but refused to pay $50 for a DVD that is already scratched up.
So, I sent this DVD back which didn't require any $$ to return it which was nice, but I live in Hawaii, and with the ""free return"" I had to wait almost 3 weeks because it was being shipped by a boat back to the mainland before I even got  credited my money back.
A month or so goes by and I completely forgot about Namaste Yoga: Season 2 that I even had it.  So, I went back online, bought Namaste Season 1 (AGAIN), I just received it today, and it's damaged (AGAIN!!!!)  Same deal, one disc loose in its case all scratched up.  Now I'm just pissed and I don't want to wait another month before I get credited again and don't even want to bother purchasing it again.  Going to try and see if I can return Season 2 now because this is a waste of my time and money.  $100 for two seasons really?  It's too bad because I had heard such great reviews.
Update:  Been over a month now, and I have yet to be refunded for season 1.  Tried tracking my order and it says please try again later.  Really???  Pain in the ass.",1361491200,5,1685,4.110091743119266
4703177,1,B005HRNDH8,"I am confounded by the reviews saying that this DVD is good for beginners - there is little to no instruction whatsoever - the episodes essentially boil down to attractive women doing yoga routines expertly while the narrator names off the poses (""going into LATERAL ANGLE POSE now"" - and that's all you get) and coos about feeling the energy flow through you.  Since there is NO (NONE ZERO) audible explanation for the poses, you are forced to crane your neck to look at the screen while attempting to do the yoga pose at the same time and interpret what's going on on screen, except that all too often, even for brand new poses the camera is zoomed into a woman's face or midriff, leaving you to haphazardly guess what they're doing.  So, no audible instruction, and severely limited and inconvenient visual instruction.  Right, well I figured I'd head onto their website and see if they keep their useful instruction on there.  Turns out there are two websites (the ""instructor's"" and the distributor's) and neither have any useful information (despite the distributor's website being labeled ""learning materials"").  Through Google I found pose instructions within one of those websites (not sure which, since neither actually link there for whatever reason), but the instructions are extremely vague, overflowing with the same inane babble about 'feeling the energy' and only a handful of words about the incredibly-important-this-is-why-we're-here actual mechanics.  I was literally about to sit down with a pen and paper, watch an episode, and write down my own >>useful<< instructions, when I cut myself off in disgust.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.

The only thing I don't like about them is that they sometimes zoom in on the yoga ladies just as they are introducing a new move.  Yes, they are very pretty and serene looking, but I'd rather see what it is that I'm supposed to be doing.

It was a little too glossy for me while offering no actual instruction on how to safely perform
the movements.  I much prefer Yoga Journal's Yoga For Strength and Toning, which is demanding
for a relative newcomer to yoga like myself -- yet it's clear and instructive, taught by an excellent teacher.
Regardless, I would have kept the Namaste Yoga had I known that there would be a 50% restocking
fee on the return!  So I ended up with nothing -- for which I paid approximately $25.  Even if I didn't like

This yoga DVD is awesome. The music and background are relaxing not distracting.  The verbal instructions are just right, not too much explanation to take away from the relaxing and rythmic movements.  I like the reminders to breath as I tend to hold my breath while excersizing.  Each session includes warm up, main sequences, and cool down which take 30 min each.  Just enough to get you stretched and oxygenated before work.  They way the DVD is organzied you could easily do a warm up and select multiple main sequences if you wanted to have a longer workout before the cool down. The positions rythmically move from one to another fairly quickly and it may take a beginner awhile to become familiar with the positions but that is true of any yoga class too.  I've done every session on the DVD for season 1 and will be purchasing season 2.  You will not be disappointed with the DVD.",1352505600,,1058,4.625668449197861

I refuse to pay more for Season One. Word to the wise, purchase Season One Parts 1 & 2 to get the right price for the material. Shame on whoever is responsible for the price increase.

4703206,4,B005HRNDH8,"I learned about this yoga series from watching it on TV.  They stopped the series, though, and I tried to find anything else like it with no success. What's special about this program is that each thorough session is only 22 minutes long.  Hard core yoga people, will tell you that is not long enough for a true yoga experience, but it is perfect for someone who hates exercise & whose excuse for not doing it is the argument of not having enough time (like me).  Each 22 minute session has a warm up, a 12 minute ""flow"" workout, and a warm down/relaxation.  Somehow, in that short time, I find myself achieving a sweat and feeling appropriately stretched out and worked out when I'm finished.

I'm sure that the program is doing something good, because, after doing it every morning for about 2 weeks, not only did I feel stronger and less stiff, but I discovered I lost 7 pounds!

My only warning is that it is not very instructional.  If you haven't taken yoga before, I imagine it might be confusing.  I have taken yoga a fair amount, and sometimes do wonder if I am doing a pose from the DVD correctly.  This DVD could benefit greatly if there were a booklet or something that explained the rock bottom basics of yoga and also gave advice for how best to use the DVD.  For example, would it be good or bad to do 2 sessions in a day if you felt like it?",1341273600,10,1357,4.307086614173229
4703207,5,B005HRNDH8,"Generally, yoga improves quality of life beyond flexibility and strength.  The woman who gives instruction on this DVD has a soothing and pleasant voice.  I purchased the first season, became addicted, and now purchased the second season.  After taking a variety of yoga classes, the best is to have your mat and DVD handy in your living room.  I wake up 30 minutes earlier now, but the benefits last me throughout the day.  You might as well purchase both seasons, because it is inevitable!  Enjoy!",1338595200,3,499,4.811764705882353
4703208,5,B005HRNDH8,"I've done a number of different yoga classes and DVDs and this is by far my favourite type of practice. For doing yoga on your own, this series is fantastic!

I had discovered Namaste on TV and was doing it regularly until we moved and changed cable providers. I'm so happy I finally got the DVD! I am currently 5 months pregnant and have now been doing a routine daily since I received the DVD (there are a few routines I skip because they're becoming difficult with my belly, but most of them are fine).

This literally gets me out of bed in the morning. I thought I would have trouble motivating myself to wake up earlier to fit it in, but I don't. I wake up to give myself enough time to do the workout because I WANT to. It makes me feel so good physically and emotionally. The sessions are short, but I still feel that I'm getting a good workout (especially combined with a walk afterwards). You can always add in another 12 minute ""dynamic flow"" to lengthen the workout if you feel you need more.

I believe this is a great practice for yogis of all levels. The way the flow builds up to the final routine is awesome because it gives you an opportunity to learn the poses if you're new, or improve on them if you're more experienced. I especially find that by the end, I really get the breath integration down and it makes the flow feel great.

Another plus of this series is that it gives you variety, rather than getting a DVD with the same routine on it. I just follow along in sequence and do a different routine every day.

Honestly, if you're looking for a yoga DVD to practice with on your own, this is the BEST. Worth every penny! I'll be getting season 2 and probably some of Kate Potter's other DVDs, too!",1338336000,3,1722,4.286153846153846
4703209,4,B005HRNDH8,"As much as I like what this series is about, and the nice choreography of the workouts - I felt pretty rushed in the workouts. Stretches that last only a few seconds aren't long enough to gain the full benefit to your muscles - and relaxation sessions that last only 15 seconds are not really deep relaxation.

Having said that - the use of a lot of repetition in the choreography in part makes up for the rushed workouts. Also noteworthy are the high DVD production values including pictoral sets, 3 student demonstrators, and clear voiced over instructions.

If you are in a rush and need to get your a quick yoga practice (24 minutes) in along with a bit of cardio, this may be for you. Rodney Yee's ""Ultimate Power Yoga"" (while only 1 DVD) probably achieves these goals more effectively with a slower pace while still providing a comprehensive workout - I think there are 5 on this Rodney Yee DVD.

But, I was looking for other workouts to try since I had been using Rodney Yee's DVD for over a year...

I have rated this product a 4 because there is a long of class content, and a lot ideas that at the very least could be watched and adopted for your own personal practice without the DVD running...",1336348800,3,1205,4.414414414414415

If you are busy, as I am, then you will appreciate the length of each class @ approximately 25 minutes per class.  Therefore, it's reasonable to squeeze in a work out every day.  After I complete the exercises I feel much better and healthier.  I would highly recommend this work out series to all.  It's excellent.",1335571200,2,480,4.459770114942529

4703223,5,B005HRNDH8,"If you are new to yoga, this is how you should learn.  If you are a seasoned yogi, this is how you should practice.

I, like so many others, came across Namaste on FitTv and it was absolutely life altering for me.  5 years ago, after the birth of my 2nd daughter, something in my body had changed.  I had acquired an annoying pain that started in my back.  First I did what most people do and tried to ignore it, but after months of chronic pain that only seemed to get worse (I could only sleep in a chair), I finally saw a physician.  This led to 5 years of Dr.'s, testing, medications, multiple diagnoses (osteoarthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia)...all of which seemed to say that I would have to find a way to ""live with the pain.""  At its worst, I was barely able to get out of bed, rarely could stand up straight without excruciating pain and spasms.  Not only was I practically unable to care for my two young children, I couldn't enjoy them.  I couldn't be the ""fun mom"" that I was and longed to be.  This coupled with the pain I felt everyday spiraled me into a depression.

I became pregnant again and surprisingly all of my symptoms seemed to disappear during the pregnancy.  This was a great relief to both my husband and myself. However, a few months after her birth, the symptoms started to reappear...slowly.  In search of a less medicated and more holistic approach, I came across Namaste. I watched, and I knew that it was exactly what I needed.  The sessions are fluid, they are meditative and they are challenging.  I absolutely LOVE everything about them: the music, the instruction, the location, the ambiance, EVERYTHING.  I am not new to yoga or meditation but am far from a seasoned yogi.  I have never come across instruction that I can listen to in my own home that was so thorough and so thoughtful.  When I completed a session, I felt calm, strong and beautiful.  That's saying alot considering I had a newborn suffering from ""colic"" and reflux for 18 months and was somehow surviving on 3 -4 hours of interrupted sleep every night.

Looking back nearly brings me to tears because I have no idea how we all survived, but we did.  I recently gave birth to my 4th (and last) daughter.  These last few weeks I have noticed the pain creeping back in again and it sent me in search of Namaste.  Kate Potter is a genius, truly.

If you are in the best health, if you are not in the best health, Namaste is for you.  If you are looking for a challenge and want to build your core strength, this will do it.  If you are looking for meditation and peace, you will find it here.  It made me feel human again.  I look forward to starting and sometimes ending every day with it.  It's my time to do something for myself, for my mind, body and spirit.  As a mother of 4, I have to choose what I do with ""my time"" wisely.  Namaste is the perfect fit.",1319673600,102,2879,4.365348399246704

Kate has an equally soothing and encouraging voice.  The scenery is beautiful not just a dance studio full of people and chaos.  I love this workout.  I have even got my 16 year old daughter to join me.  Can't wait to get the 2nd season for Christmas this year.",1319500800,2,576,4.277777777777778

4703226,5,B005HRNDH8,"Before I practiced Namaste Yoga, I practiced going to a chiropractor...!
One day, he was nice enough to advise me I should find a workout I loved, to get back into shape, so he won't have to fix my back, time and time again!

By chance, I found Namaste Yoga on Fit TV!
I was completely astounded by the whole show... before I even decided to start exercising, I was just watching, amazed at how beautiful the scenery was, how soothing the music, how accurate Kate's soft voice was, in explaining the flow of movement and how easy it actually was for me to follow, considering I was a beginner, with back problems nonetheless!
The health benefits I encountered after just a few episodes were truly the fruit of my own labor, but based solely on the greatest Yoga TV Show I ever came across, Namaste Yoga by Kate Potter.

After a while, I no longer found the show on Fit TV, so I got Namaste: The Complete First Season DVD.
Although they should bring it back since so many voices have called for it again and again!
The Complete First Season DVD has its benefits of no commercials, as well as a great variety of episodes to choose from.

I will have to add that the sound alone of the word ""Yoga"" was intimidating for me, before finding it on TV or even reading about it... but in the privacy of my own home, it brought me peace of mind, physical health and strength, and most importantly it brought me closer to a God inside my heart, while in Namaste prayer pose, finding spiritual inspiration...
So YES, go ahead and get it, practice and it will do you good, just like my chiropractor said!
Now I'm Looking forward to the next seasons as well! Practicing something I love, is sooo rewarding!
Thanks to the girls in Namaste Yoga show and Kate Potter, I have a strong back now! :)

You need a basic level of familiarity with yoga poses to start, but you could gain that by watching the routine before trying it. The amazing thing about this series that you can keep getting better; those suggestions you didn't quite get suddenly gain meaning and your practice goes up a notch. To exercise your whole body, you will want season 2, too (and maybe 3&4)!  Although I use other videos and on-line services, I always come back home to Kate Potter and Namaste Yoga.",1522713600,,676,4.451612903225806

8473507,4,B005HRNDH8,"I am a total beginner when it comes to yoga. I have been doing this DVD the last week or so. I have been trying the same episode until I feel like I have a good hold on that move before going on to the next episode. It would be much easier if I had known some of the basic poses, like exalted warrior, before I started. None-the-less, after a couple days of fumbling through, I think I am getting the hang of it and I like this series and the flow. I also am feeling great afterwards!",1516406400,,484,3.9489795918367347
8473508,2,B005HRNDH8,"We purchased this to do Sunday yoga with the family. I so badly want to give this a single star, but I did get some great stretching in and the routines/sessions were just the right lengths of time. Saying that you'd think that more stars would be justified. It's not. The production of these episodes is completely frustrating. You need to absolutely know every single yoga pose in order to follow along. You'd think hearing hear talk you through would help, but the ""relaxing"" music distracts you from hearing what she is saying. They care more about showing details of the models' stomachs and butts that you almost never see their full body. So you can't keep up with what position they are in or transitioning to. We had to continuously stop and rewind in order to figure out how they were positioned.",1515888000,15,806,4.643356643356643

8473510,1,B005HRNDH8,"These videos are NOT for the beginner and here is why...When the narrator transitions from one pose to another it does not show the pose.  In stead the camera zooms in on these women's great abs but the viewer is left wondering what the pose looks like.  I get it that their abs are in great condition and it is from the yoga but I will not be able to develop my abs if I have NO IDEA WHAT the pose looks like!  I do NOT recommend this to a beginner.

8473511,4,B005HRNDH8,I like this yoga series but find it a bit difficult to follow in the beginning since they camera zooms in and out while they start a new pose.  I don't understand why they don't show the full view of the movements before zooming into a specific body part or some random aerial view.,1506556800,2,282,4.222222222222222
