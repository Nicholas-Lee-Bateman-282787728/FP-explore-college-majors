8361337,1,1572270950,"Big disappointment!  It is not the older original Havoc In Heaven. My children and I had greatly enjoyed stills in book form of a different Havoc In Heaven film by Yan Dingxian, Pu Jiaxiang, Lin Wenxiao, etc. It was made into a lovely, intelligent book by Tang Cheng published by Foreign Languages Press, Beijing, 1979?  The art in these stills is gorgeous & so is the story line.
This film I'm reviewing is boring,dumb, maybe fundamentalist so I discarded it.",1248739200,10,460,4.7375
