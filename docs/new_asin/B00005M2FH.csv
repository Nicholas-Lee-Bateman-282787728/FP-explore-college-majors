Discovered the VCR tapes, bought the 3 I could find (its an old show from the 90s) and they watch them almost exclusively.  The whole family adores George & Martha!  My only complaints are 1) the show isn't on TV anymore and 2) haven't found any DVD cys.",1375401600,,378,4.3428571428571425
7945070,5,B00005M2FH,"George and Martha are best of friends - and these stories DO feature the recurrent theme of them having realistic fallings-out and resolving them. This tape ALSO contains a hilarious Don King parody. Thus, G&M are not only good role models; these stories are fun for them and their parents to watch.",1057104000,2,299,4.769230769230769
