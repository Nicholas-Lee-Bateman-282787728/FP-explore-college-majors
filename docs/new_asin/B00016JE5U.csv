1975175,4,B00016JE5U,"This television series is based on the books of Laura Ingalls Wilder (1867-1957), who wrote the story of her family's life on the prairie.  I read these books growing up and then loved the TV series as well.  Michael Landon, that I had seen on ""Bonanza"", was the icing on the cake:  one of my favorite actors helping to tell one of my favorite stories.
Here's an episode guide, with a tiny description:
1.  Castoffs:  Pa gives Laura a new dog after her dog Jack dies.  She doesn't want a new dog.
2.  Times Of Change:  Charles and Mary are very disappointed in what life in Chicago is really like.

3.  My Ellen:  Friend Ellen drowns and Ellen's mother thinks that Laura is her daughter.
4.  The Handyman:  When Charles is away, Mary suspects that Caroline and a hired man are falling in love.

5.  The Wolves:  After Laura and Andy set up a pen for wolf cubs in the barn, wild dogs try to get into the barn.
6.. The Creeper of Walnut Grove:  Laura and Andy try to figure who is stealing things in Walnut Grove with hilarious results.
7.  To Run And Hide:  Dr. Baker finds a new doctor for the town after he loses a patient, only to find that the new doctor may not be so dedicated.
8.  The Aftermath:  Jesse and Frank James take hostages.
9.  The High Cost Of Being Right:  After their barn burns down, Mr. Garvey's wife gets a job in spite his objections.
10. The Fighter:  Charles boxes a man who turns out to be very ill.
11. Meet Me At The Fair:  At the fair, Carrie climbs into the basket of a hot air balloon.
12. Here Come The Brides:  A newcomer falls in love with Miss Beadle, and Nellie Oleson falls in love with the newcomer's son.

13. Freedom Flight:  The citizens of Walnut Grove are hostile toward an Indian boy and his sick father.
14. The Rivals:  Charles tries to save his business from a competitor.  Laura competes with another girl for a boy that she loves.
15. Whisper Country:  As a new teacher in a backwoods community, Mary gets opposition from a resident who tries to convince everyone that a school isn't needed.
16. I Remember, I Remember:  On Charles and Caroline's wedding anniversary, Charles is unable to make it home on time.
17. Be My Friend:  Laura and her Pa find a baby.

18. The Inheritance:  Charles spends an inheritance and then discovers the money is worthless.
19. The Stranger:  Mr Oleson sends his nephew to Charles to learn some morals.

20. A Most Precious Gift:  Caroline has a new baby.

21.  I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away (1):  Mary goes blind.

22.  I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away (2):  Mary goes to a blind school in Iowa.
I hope that Goldhil Home Media corrects what were problems in early season DVD's with some audio and visual quality problems, cut scenes, and episodes out of order.  The improvements we saw in the third season included chapters within episodes, and credits with each episode.  Although LHOTP was geared toward children, many adults watch it.  I hope that whoever is putting season 4 together has realized that and makes the other needed improvements! This is a five star show and deserves five star DVD treatment!",1074643200,174,3094,4.442857142857143
1975176,5,B00016JE5U,"In this day of reality T.V., In your face attitudes and shallow charictors, It's real cool to see family togetherness, decent acting and memorable stories. Finely it's an option to own this classic where Love conquers all. I own the first 3 seasons and find the quality of the picture excellent especially considering that the series aired close to thirty years ago. Thank You.",1074470400,5,377,4.90625
1975177,5,B00016JE5U,"For those who'd like to know, here is the in-order list of episodes from Season Four, which first aired from September 1977 to March 1978.  Memorable moments include the death of Laura's beloved dog Jack (and the introduction of his replacement Bandit), a near divorce of the Garveys (that concludes in the judge pronouncing both of them ""crazy,""), Carrie's adventures in a hot-air balloon, the birth of Grace Ingalls, Mary's dealing with blindness, and the introduction of Adam Kendall. Thanks to all involved in the DVD release of this beloved TV series!  I can't wait to buy this one!

1975178,5,B00016JE5U,"I have seen seasons 1-6 of Little House on the Prairie so far and Season 4 happens to be one of my favorites. I have gotten Little House on the Prairie The Complete Season 4 from the library on Collector's Edition, though we now own it on Deluxe Remastered Edition. I like Collector's Edition better than Deluxe Remastered Edition though, because Collector's Edition is nicer and more old-fashioned looking, though I do not like that it has deleted scenes and no subtitles. If Collector's Edition only had subtitles and no missing scenes, it would be perfect for my pleasure.

I thought the music on the menu (the part on the beginning of the DVD where it shows highlights from different episodes and lets you choose an episode on the same disc to watch) sounded soooooooo happy! It was in A-flat Major, my favorite major in music. I could listen to the music all day long!!! That is a big reason I REALLY hope Little House on the Prairie on Collector's Edition continues to exist for an extremely long time. If the people continue to make new editions for Little House on the Prairie, I really hope they include that happy sounding music in A-flat major.

My favorite episode from Season 4 is I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away. I also like Castoffs, Wolves, and the Stranger. On the episode I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away, it is very sad that Mary goes permanently blind. I enjoy the episode though. At the blind school in Iowa, she meets her future husband, Adam Kendall. In the end a lot of people move out of Walnut Grove and As Long As We're Together (the two-part episode right after I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away. As Long As We're Together is on the very beginning of Season 5).

Little House on the Prairie has a good variety of episodes, I could watch some all day! My favorite episodes include some from Season 6 (Back to School, Sweet Sixteen, He Loves Me He Loves Me Not) and the Reincarnation of Nellie (from Season 8). For anyone who is particularly interested in watching Little House on the Prairie, I highly recommend those episodes! As a matter of fact, those episodes are so good that even people who say they dislike Little House on the Prairie might enjoy those.

I hope customers who buy this item enjoy Little House on the Prairie as much as I do!",1479945600,,2274,4.498789346246974

1975185,5,B00016JE5U,"Strong story telling with strong moral values seems to be a dying art.  Fortunately, DVDs like this Little House series mean you and your family can enjoy and benefit whenever it's convenient from the great messages and lessons this stellar series provides.  Especially if you have children this is a fantastic moral values teaching tool, while being highly entertaining.
It's great to be able to pause, and discuss parts.  My daughter especially was having me pause more than I was.  Michael Landon (God rest his soul) was a genius of a kind.  No matter how often these are watched, either old lessons and values are reinforced or new ones are noticed and learned.
This great country was founded and grew up on the strong Christian values depicted so eloquently in this Little House series.",1440806400,,791,4.873134328358209

Season four is another great season.  Half-way through we seem to see a maturity in Laura and Mary as they suddenly seemed to age overnight, and by the end of the season we say farewell to our beloved school teacher.

The Garvy family are introduced at the beginning of this season in ""Castoffs.""  We also say goodbye to beloved family pet, Jack.  Several of my favorites are in this:  ""Times of Change"" (last appearance of John Jr.), ""The Wolves,"" ""The Creeper of Walnut Grove,"" (Probably my favorite comical episode); ""To Run and Hide,"" ""The Aftermath"" (what western lover wouldn't like this episode featuring Frank and Jessie James?); ""Here Comes the Brides,"" and ""I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away.""

Excellent acting by every member of the cast, and especially Mellisa Gilbert as Laura Ingells.  She was really one special young actress.  A great show for the whole family to watch together.

Sure it's a bit idealistic in some cases, and seeing the constant melodramatic struggles the Ingalls face is redundant at times, it also makes you feel very happy for the mod cons we often take for granted.

1975268,5,B00016JE5U,"Little House on the Prairie - Season 4

The original nine books could never have provided enough material for the nine TV seasons. New stories were created that continued the original characters, as with other TV shows. The real question is: how authentically did they follow the original stories? Some fans of the original books were disappointed by these TV adaptions. New characters were introduced. Hollywood changes books to condense and simplify them to fit into the allotted time slots and reach a wider audience. These books were written in the mid 1930s from her personal experiences which no historian can match. Laura lost her savings in the Great Depression. An adult who reads Laura's books can see things that a teenager may miss. The economic depressions of their era are referenced implicitly by the family migrations. Young Laura would have little knowledge of these problems. An older Laura censored events that were not suitable for children's books. This was NBC's highest rated series during most of its nine years. Here are the titles of the twenty-four shows.

1975272,5,B00016JE5U,"I learned that LHOTP was being aired on cable and put an episode on for my Nickelodeon & Disney channel addict 10 year old daughter. She was hesitant at first, but 10 minutes into the show, she was mesmerized, laughing out loud and asking a million questions about the characters. She was HOOKED -- I was happy to see her take such an interest in a show that remains timeless.

I purchased all 9 seasons for Xmas and we have been watching them as often as we can during her holiday break from school. She loves the characters and can relate to the school drama of Laura & Nellie and gets such a kick out of the similarities in her own life.

I declined to get the 9 season boxed set due to some lack luster reviews, and opted instead for each individual season -- a bit more bulk to the entertainment center storage, but, worth it. I did notice that as the seasons progress, so does the audio and visual quality.

In the earlier seasons, there are times where we had to increase the volume significantly in order to hear the dialogue -- and then quickly decrease the volume-- which was a bit tiresome. We are in the midst of season 4 right now and sound & audio are getting better.

No typical dvd options (i.e. subtitles, scene selection is only available when you get further into the seasons) and no special features other than written text available in the earlier seasons. Not a dealbreaker.

The episodes are entertaining and great to watch together as a family. Highly recommend.",1325376000,,1486,4.488888888888889
1975273,5,B00016JE5U,"All 9 Seasons of Little House on the Prairie provided wholesome entertainment for the whole family... God is mentioned in nearly every episode and people are encouraged to have love, compassion and understanding of each other. You just can't find entertainment like this on DVD or TV anymore..  :-) If there were more than 5 stars to rate Little House on, I'd make it the BEST!!",1315008000,,378,4.7272727272727275
1975274,5,B00016JE5U,"This CD pack is excellent. It's got some really good episodes and is appropriate for my 11-year old daughter. There is an episode where a child drowns, but it is done tastefullly, and encourages thoughtful discussion between parents and their children, I think.",1293494400,,261,5.093023255813954
1975275,4,B00016JE5U,"Season four sure does bring a lot of changes to the residents of Walnut grove and specifically to the Ingalls Family. I'm only fifteen so these episodes were all new for me and boy is season four a fantastic season. This season offers a few more very dramatic episodes than the previous season and I am fully convinced that these actors are the best actors in the history of television. Too bad I can't say this DVD collection is the best in the history of DVD's.

There are a few problems like the last three releases with the quality of the film but hey, what are you gonna do, like I mentioned in my previous reviews in the pamphlet they explain that there may be scenes missing and film deterioration so I'll leave it at that. There is a bonus feature but don't get excited, it's entitled ""Insiders share their memories of season four""...in the form of notes. I'm sorry but I would much rather watch in interview than read notes with a very small font, nonetheless, they are interesting but if there were some better bonus material I would give this season a flat out five star rating. (Oh and there are a couple interesting stories in the pamphlet that I'd recommend looking at.)

But all these little nit-picks aren't even a big deal because season four is fantastic! I don't think I can name my favorite episodes because they were all so good. There are quite a few changes in season four, Laura's dog Jack dies and Charles finds a stray dog called Bandit who becomes a member of the Ingalls family, Nellie falls in love with a surprising ending, Laura begins to become attracted to a boy at her school,  just to name a few. And some of these episodes are so intense! ""My Ellen"" is very creepy, Laura and Mary go swimming with a friend named Ellen who drowns, and Ellen's mother cannot accept her death, in this episode you definitely see how hard it must be to lose a loved one, but by far the most emotional episodes is the final two parter ""I'll Be Waving as You Drive Away"" as we witness the slow deterioration of Mary's eyesight.

But really, it's impossible to list all of the best episodes because every episode is darn near perfect, all I can say is buy season four and every other season of Little House. I'm dying to get season five as fast as I can...oh yeah, WHERE THE HECK IS MR. EDWARDS DURING THIS SEASON!!!",1293494400,,2329,4.434579439252336

1975277,4,B00016JE5U,"Good season of this quality show, but not the same without Victor French's character who was one of the highlights of previous seasons with his 'lovable rogue' qualities.

The replacement character Jonathan Garvey is decent enough but very bland compared to Isaiah Edwards.

Plus the forced laughs from various characters have become more fake and unconvincing in this season.

Despite those few niggles however this is still a nice stroll down memory lane.

But Season 2 of LHOTP will always be my favourite. The writing and acting was par excellence.

I find things start going a little downhill from Season 4 onwards.

The picture and sound on the DVDs is pretty good, not world class but very watchable.",1284508800,,707,4.9491525423728815

1975296,5,B00016JE5U,"I enjoyed all 9 seasons. This show was well cast, as everyone has personality. Many of the characters are likeable, characters-to-admire. They actually put a lot of work into the sets, building the little house and the small town. There is great character-acting with the bratty kids Nellie and Willie, their bratty mother, their henpecked father, and the bachelor Mr. Edwards who teaches little Laura to spit a long distance, appalling her mother. They shoot on location in many episodes. The shots never look staged, taking you there. The stories are interesting, lively, moving, and uplifting, with some guest writers and guest stars for variety.

The books have entirely different stories, and are very interesting. The books are true stories. Anyone who likes the TV show would like reading the books too. It is interesting how they lived and survived on the prairie. Laura Ingalls sure had a lot of adventures, with the family or family members just escaping death several times. Some of the show's pilot episode is in one of the books, but still very little, not even one book's worth of the nine book series. Laura Ingalls Wilder grew up just after the Civil War, living in Indian territory, that was not yet a State. Once her family was nearly killed by hundreds of Indians on the warpath. Yet she lived to see the automobile, airplane, color television, and the opening of Disneyland.

Similar good series are: ""Anne of Green Gables"", ""Road to Avonlea seasons 1-6"", ""Christy - the complete series"", and fairly made ""Father Murphy seasons 1-2"".",1172966400,,1553,4.946360153256705

1975300,5,B00016JE5U,"Season 4 of Little House probably has the most turmoil and changes for little Walnut Grove and its townspeople as of yet.

In this season, Laura's beloved dog Jack dies (of old age) and she is so distraught that she cannot accept the family's new pet, Bandit; Charles and Mary travel to Chicago, where Charles calls himself a dumb farmer and Mary finds out that her fiance John is no longer in love with her; Charles goes away for business and handyman Chris is hired to finish the kitchen for Caroline, in the process falling in love with her; Doc Baker loses a patient in a fall and decides that he is no longer a good doctor and decides to become a farmer instead; Alice and Jonathan Garvey nearly divorce over Alice working; Jesse and Frank James hide out from the law in Walnut Grove; Miss Beadle falls in love with farmer Adam Simms, Nellie falls in love with Adam's son Luke, and both run off to get married (only the elder Simms' marriage is a keeper); Mary gets her first teaching job, in a backwoods country; the Ingalls family learns of a big inheritance, causing their old friends to think they will be putting on airs and Mrs. Oleson to want to rub shoulders with them; the Ingalls family welcomes Baby Grace; Mary begins to lose her eyesight and after becoming blind, goes to a special school in Iowa; with the town's resources and economy faltering due to the railroad, the Ingalls family decides to follow Mary to Winoka, Dakota, where she has a teaching job with her instructor, Adam.

The last two episodes of this season are two of the very finest that Little House would ever produce.  The emotions are raw and very much on the surface.  The acting is stellar - - in fact, Melissa Sue Anderson was nominated for an Emmy for her work as Mary in the two part episode.

Additionally, characters such as Bandit the dog, Kezia, Joe Kagan and Adam Kendall would make their first appearances during this season.  And established characters such as Jack the dog, Miss Beadle (Mrs. Simms)and John Sanderson mark their final appearances during this season.

All in all, a turning point for Little House and Walnut Grove and the end of the ""early"" episodes.  But nonetheless, a stellar season and chock full of classic episodes.  A must have and a must see for these beloved characters!",1150675200,11,2295,4.591687041564792

Obviously, Melissa Sue's best performance on this whole series is highlighted with the final episode of this season, entitled ""I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away"".

1975306,2,B00016JE5U,"Time to hitch those horses and saddle up for another session of edited, and very washed out looking episodes of 'Little House on the Prairie', and by this I mean you are in for a very rocky ride through season IV!

Before you buy, please consider the following:-

Most of the episodes in this DVD set have cuts in with some extremely jarring moments when the picture goes hard to black.  The general picture quality is poor, being either cast towards one color, or looking very bleached.

I must have been very lucky in the UK, because episodes broadcast in the 1970's were without cuts and played directly from 35mm film prints that looked fantastic!  I therefore find it very difficult, almost impossible, to understand why in the 21st century, and with all the technology now available, that what I am seeing today seems to have become an acceptable norm.

So what are you watching on these DVD's?  Well, since digital restoration from film prints or film negatives never looks this terrible, there is only one answer: they must be recordings from old analogue video tapes.  This theory is supported by the fact that some episodes display tape dropout and tape creases.  It would also explain the cuts had the tapes been previously used by US broadcasters.

Those with a keen eye will spot that in the small print on the later sets of LHOTP there is a disclaimer which states something along the lines of ""...have been taken from the best masters available"".

Note the weasel word 'available'. Of course the best masters are the original film negatives. It would cost more effort, time and money to go that extra mile as do the less lazy DVD studios.",1120348800,9,1653,4.685121107266436

My particuar comment pertains to ""I'll be waiveing as you drive away"" this is a two parter and in it mary loses her sight. I think that michal and the rest of the show creater did a wonderful job on this episod. I am visually impaired myself and I have guide dog. I have seen this episode many times and no one else since malissa sue anderson (mary) has ever played a blind person well. She did the best job I have ever seen.

1975309,1,B00016JE5U,"This is so sad.

Here I was happy to be able to get all those seasons of ""Little House"" in such wonderful crisp picture quality on DVD.  And then came season 3 out and the trouble began.  All of a sudden the picture quality was not there anymore.  (Other reviewers wrote about it already.)  It looked worse than anything I had ever seen being offered on DVD before.

I had been looking forward to buying all the seasons for my family and my grandchildren.  We know the stories from its first airing on TV.  What was I supposed to do?  I did buy season 4 again to see if it got better.  It did not improve.  It was just as bad again, maybe worse.  I will not buy any further seasons anymore if these transfers stay as poor in picture quality as they are now.  Even if it means that I and my family will cry about it.  I will show them ""The Waltons"", ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ""Road to Avonlea"" instead.

At least you don't have to see what they are doing to your creation, Michael Landon!

1975310,1,B00016JE5U,"Little House is one of the best family shows ever made and deserves far better treatment than what is given here.  DVD seasons 1-3 suffer from the same problems, but season 4 seems to be the runt of the litter.  There are a number of problems from poor audio (there are times when someone is speaking and no sound at all is heard), lack of picture clearness, horrible editing, deleted scenes and an overall feeling of inbalance. The people responsible for this abonimation should be ashamed of themselves.

1975311,3,B00016JE5U,"""Little House on the Prairie"" needs no defense or praise:  it was a fabulous show, it easily could have lasted longer on television, and it remains eminently watchable and rewatchable today.  Unfortunately, the show has suffered in DVD treatment.  Many episodes are inexplicably cut, as if they were taken from a TBS rerun feed instead of the original film.  The picture quality could also be much better.  It is unfortunate that such a fabulous show has suffered so on DVD.  LHOTP deserves better.  I wish I could recommend these DVDs, but perhaps with enough fan complaint better editions  (maybe also with some extras!) will one day become available.",1086048000,14,653,4.981481481481482

If I had recorded this on tape years and years ago, I could have transfered it to DVD myself and achieved a better end result. It is fuzzy...  Out door scenes are always washed out...  sometimes the color changes right before your eyes...  and the cuts that used to be there for commercials chops off as though it has been trimmed and trimmed until now the cuts are too soon amking them horrible transitions...

The DVDs were great and the BEST part was that I saw a lot of extra uncut scenes!! But, with the next season there were NO uncut scenes. Both this fact and the decrease in quality with each additional release make me somewhat disappointed. Each time I wonder if I should purchase the next season. It looks like they are not paying attention to detail and not going the extra mile by putting the uncut scenes and extras we are used to on DVDs (that is why they cost more than VHS right?). Oh well...",1082246400,6,640,4.169354838709677
1975314,3,B00016JE5U,"While the sets aren't perfect, THERE ARE MANY CRISP, CLEAR, SHARP, COLORFUL EPISODES IN SETS 1 TO 3.  They looked SO good in fact, that it's as if they were filmed yesterday, and look far better than when they were originally broadcast.  I'm in awe at just how great many of them look!  That said...  Whoever is responsible for encoding several of the episodes in this 4TH set, and whoever is responsible for releasing them in this manner ought to be ashamed.  I've never seen a worse job of encoding for a DVD.  We have VERY poor video and audio quality in several of the episodes, plus severely hacked and missing scenes where the commercial breaks are.  Many of these episodes appear to be DVD's made from video tape copies of broadcast episodes.

Remember watching the show on TBS?  For several episodes, you would be better off watching a tape of those rather than watching some of these on DVD.  Again, who would possibly release a set with so many flaws???  Several of the episodes in the earlier sets looked so good (with certain exceptions), but as the sets progress, it seems like the quality just continues to get worse and worse.  That being said, there are still certain episodes in the set which DO look very good, and have been VERY WELL restored, but on a whole, most are not up to par AT ALL!!

I'm VERY dissapointed in the hack job they did on these.  You will simply have to try to ignore all of this in order to enjoy the top quality stories for one of the best television shows in history, which deserve a much better presentation than this!!  Sometimes you can ignore it.  Sometimes you can't, but you get used to it.  Despite this, I still strongly recommend buying the complete series, as I have a great respect for everyone involved in the production, including the actors, not to mention the much-needed values the show teaches.  5 stars, no, make that 100 stars for the production, and 1 star for the effort Goldhill made in restoring (restoring? what a joke!) this 4th DVD set.",1079568000,13,2005,4.537604456824512
1975315,4,B00016JE5U,"First of all, I love Little House and will without a doubt purchase the entire collection of dvds for this series.  It is wonderful to watch the shows in order and to see how the series evolved through the seasons.  I have to say though that there are errors and those errors have been noticed.  Episodes are flipped around (season 3), segways to ""commercials"" are chopped, the box art and dvd art seem to be one season ahead, and there are many edited scenes - something I really didn't expect with dvds.  For example, I have an old vhs version of ""I'll Be Waving As You Drive Away"" and there are scenes on that tape that are NOT included in the season 4 boxed-set version of that episode!  I really hope season 5 fares better in this respect as every scene is important and should, if at all possible, be included!  Regardless of these criticisms I'm very glad this series is available in season sets. Little House has lots of class which is something sorely missing on television today.",1079481600,8,989,4.4972067039106145
