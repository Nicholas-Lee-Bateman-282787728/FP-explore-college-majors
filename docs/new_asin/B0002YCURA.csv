2143959,1,B0002YCURA,I purchased this thinking it to be a Dead concert or a collection of various concerts. None of that - it's a guitar learning DVD which completely will turn-off anybody. The review which was there was equally misleading. Don't touch it.,1102464000,3,235,4.7560975609756095
2143972,4,B0002YCURA,"Dopeheads should pass when it comes to reviewing purchases. Specifically, to the two ""gentlemen"" who gave this video one star because the Grateful Dead weren't in it... you must be kidding, right? The video is clearly marked as an instructional video, starring a person who was not in the Grateful Dead. Did you not read it? Did you think the publishers must be lying to you, and that Jerry has got to be in it? Really?? Put down the pipe. Inhale some fresh, clean air for awhile. Let the cobwebs in your noggin clear out. Perhaps then you will see the description of the video to be exactly what it is, and what you received. Don't give low ratings to things simply because you are stoned stupid. Give yourself a low rating instead, like I have given to you. Place blame where it belongs.
The video is a good video.",1284768000,6,816,4.446666666666666
2143973,4,B0002YCURA,"I agree with several of the others.  It's good for the basics, but I would have liked some better songs and jam tracks.  While he does break down the songs, some of them only show signature riffs and don't touch the rest of the song.  Hopefully they release more of these with more songs, include lead parts, and add jam tracks so we can play along to the whole song.  Overall a great dvd to get anyone started on this long jouney of learning to play the dead.",1255046400,2,460,4.193181818181818
2143974,5,B0002YCURA,"Excellent DVD!  Clear, concise, and exact licks.  The instructor (Nate LaPointe) clearly shows you both the Jerry and Bobby part for each song.  That's the real beauty of this DVD in that you get to see both guitar parts.  He also switches back and forth between acoustic and electric guitars and nails the tone of each. The video and audio quality is very good on this disc.

The instructor of this DVD is a practicing dead guitarist!  He plays the Bobby part in a Dead cover band in Southern California called ""Cubensis.""  Do a search on youtube to check them out. I saw them live and was blown away.  Nate is an amazing guitarist -- not with flashy licks, but he plays the most solid chord comping that I've heard.

Here are my two gripes.  Nate plays along with some jam tracks in the dvd, but it would have been nice if they had included them to practice along with.  A tab booklet would help too, but he does break down every lick on the video.  Also, the song list is kind of  typical, Casey Jones, Friend of the Devil, Etc.  Considering a serious Head is going to buy this dvd, a few deeper cuts would have been nice.  Ship of Fools, Candyman, Bird Song...

In conclusion, it's great DVD for learning to play Guitar like the Dead.  It's a fun watch, with a great instructor, and chock full of material.  I would highly recommend it.  I sincerely hope that they put out more of these DVD's.",1192406400,28,1397,4.365758754863813
2143975,4,B0002YCURA,"I expected more than I got from this release.
Based upon the brief description given, I would've expected a more in-depth perspective-- i.e., some historical research, exposition and explanation regarding Jerry and Bob's approach to their playing within the band. (Perhaps I didn't read carefully enough before ordering.)

Instead, this is a step-by-step ""how to do it right"" manual for eight of their more well-known songs.
Which, actually, is ok.

The production quality is average at best, but the licks are right on.
To learn from this video, you will need to listen well, and be willing to rewind frequently.
While the pro player will not find much here, the beginner or intermediate player certainly will.

(In the interest of context: I'm 39 and have been a guitarist and musician for 25 years, amateur and professional.)

I would've been more interested in learning about how Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir wrote, and how their separate guitar parts worked together musically, and whether they actually ever *thought* about that or not than just seeing the parts displayed for reproduction, but maybe that's just me.

Despite my possibly negative tone, I still give this release 4 stars- because it *is* useful, and fairly well-done. The fact that I expected more does not diminish the value represented here.

So go ahead-- dust off those rusty strings.
Make 'em shine.",1192147200,15,1373,5.053097345132743
2143976,4,B0002YCURA,Super instructional DVD. However NOT for the beginner. I am lending it to a friend who plays better until I am ready. Good incentive to practice more.,1191801600,10,150,4.592592592592593
2143977,4,B0002YCURA,This is a nice tutorial and accurate!  it does need a jam track of each song at the end of the lesson so that you can put it all together before jamin' with the dead.  I hope that they are doing another!!!,1153440000,12,205,3.857142857142857
2143978,5,B0002YCURA,"Apparently some people either didn't read the cover of this DVD or were confused by the phrase, ""A step-by-step breakdown of the Grateful Dead's guitar styles and techniques.""  This is an excellent tape, but it is not a concert tape!  It is a worthwhile instructional video that teaches you how to play the chords, intros, solos, etc, of these Grateful Dead classics:  Casey Jones, Uncle John's Band, Friend of the Devil, Sugar Magnolia, Truckin', China Cat Sunflower, Shakedown Street, and Touch of Grey.  There are split screen shots and everything can be figured out without using a tab (a good thing, because it doesn't come with one!).  Grateful Dead songs - and especially these - tend to use straightforward chords (there are exceptions, though).  All of these songs pretty much use major and minor chords.

So if you want to learn a bunch of Grateful Dead songs and learn the techniques employed by Bobby and Jerry, check this out!  Like I told you, what I said, if you want a concert video, you better get back to Tennesse Jed!",1153267200,43,1036,4.748603351955308
2143979,5,B0002YCURA,"Not sure how the other reviewers were mislead but this was very clearly a guitar tutorial DVD taught by a great teacher. In just one day, i was playing Uncle John's Band and Casey Jones exactly how the Dead play them. Both Jerry and Bob guitar parts are broken down and clearly explained in both close-ups on the fretboard as well as a picture-in-picture of the right hand strumming. i wish all video tutorials were this good.",1127606400,37,426,4.545454545454546
2143980,4,B0002YCURA,"What were these other reviewers thinking?  The product is by Hal Leonard, one of the foremost publishers of instrument teaching books !  Maybe the description could be written a bit better, but it was exactly what I was looking for and I am glad I found it.",1111881600,14,257,4.446808510638298
2143981,1,B0002YCURA,"Unless your learning the guitar, and want to learn ""The Dead"" cords, this is not what your looking for. The band doesn't play on this DVD !!!",1103587200,2,141,4.2592592592592595

8034689,5,B0002YCURA,"Excellent breakdown of some very epic Grateful Dead songs, paying special attention to the correct positioning of chords and riffs. Very helpful.",1488844800,2,145,5.636363636363637

8034691,2,B0002YCURA,Not practical to follow instruction by narrative. Fingering not clear just because of difficulty in getting unimpeded view by video camera. Not able to stop and start where needed. Every step is a back-and-forth drag. Should have tabs to help follow along.  I'd like  to send this back.,1447113600,3,286,4.9375
8034692,5,B0002YCURA,"Nate gives a nice view into the interplay between Jerry and Bobby. I got a better feel for how they formed leads and approached rhythm guitar. It is a special insight into the band and their playing techniques. Really nice to get a feel for songs like Uncle John's band with its special timing changes, Casey Jones with its down home approach, Touch of Grey and more. Thanks Nate, nicely done!",1378684800,,393,4.549295774647887
8034693,5,B0002YCURA,"This DVD is very nice in that it outlines and teaches the exact parts to both Jerry and Bob's guitar work for a handful of Dead songs.  If you are a Dead fan, it is great. It really helps you appreciate just hoe they weave the guitar parts together and just how dependent the two are on each other.  great to learn from, but just fun to watch as well.  Highly recommended if you are a guitar player and a Dead fan.  I just wish there was another volume with 10 more songs.",1352332800,4,472,4.043010752688172
8034694,5,B0002YCURA,The dvd got here on time.  I haven't opened the package yet because i've been busy. I am giving the seller the benefit of the doubt that all is well with the dvd.,1327795200,,162,3.909090909090909
8034695,5,B0002YCURA,"THIS IS NOT A GRATEFUL DEAD SHOW ON DVD !!!!D'OH!!!!!! PAY ATTENTION WHEN YOU BUY SOMETHING!!!!
This is however, a great tool for the intermediate guitarist wanting to learn some Jerry and Bob stuff. I've owned this for a couple years now and it has been  very useful.",1293494400,2,268,4.583333333333333
8034696,5,B0002YCURA,"When I first put this in the DVD player, I watched this from beginning to end.  Great instruction.  Fascinating how some parts that I assumed were 1 guitar, were carefully orchestrated harmonies.  Good stuff.  If you want to learn basic Deadisms with the guitar, this is it.",1289606400,3,274,4.76595744680851
