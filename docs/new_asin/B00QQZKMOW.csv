8692362,1,B00QQZKMOW,"This is a disappointingly boring documentary.  There's very little about actual photography but a lot about the subjects of Corman's portraits.  The video really gets bogged down with a lengthy section about the special olympics, which is interesting in itself, but far too long in my view.",1462579200,,290,5.148936170212766
