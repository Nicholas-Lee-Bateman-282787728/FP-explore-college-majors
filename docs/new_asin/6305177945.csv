7884194,5,6305177945,"Received on time, with this movie an interesting look see-hear into conversation and discussion
by writers, along with a mysterious woman in the background ... insight, laughs, and look-see
into other people's brains ...",1496534400,,220,5.5
7884195,5,6305177945,"This movie is probably not for everyone because it is Campy, quirky and slow going.  It is basically a movie about a problem that one screen writer (Stephen Rea) has with his ""writers block"".  He is under a deadline to get out several TV episodes and he needs to do it all in one night.  While playing poker together as usual on some designated night, his ""hack"" screen writer friends decide to help him out of his dilemma of writers block, by helping him with some ideas for several of the episodes.  Of course they are in it for themselves as well.  The movie really nails the Hollywood backbiting and stealing of ideas that seems to be a part of the whole screen writers scene.  Maybe the screen writers aren't as bad at ripping each others material off as portrayed in this video, but maybe they are.  Also the movie shows how the writers try to re-use old ideas by dressing them up as ""new"".  The whole movie is some homage to screen writers and their profession, but it gives an insight into their world that, if true, takes a lot of the glamour out of it.  I loved the movie.  But I like to have a plot and a story that is intriguing.",1483228800,,1141,4.289719626168225

7884198,4,6305177945,"Sink or Swim (aka Hacks, aka The Big Twist) is a neat little comedy about a group of Hollywood ""hack"" writers looking for the perfect story. In the introduction, a Bogart-esque main character witnesses a strange romantic encounter and, along with his friends, tries to develop a script based on what he saw. The cast features Stephen Rea, Illeana Douglas, John Ritter, Tom Arnold, Robert Patrick, Ryan O'Neal, Jason Priestley, Olivia d'Abo, Lisa Kudrow and Bob Odenkirk! There are funny moments throughout, with plenty of film-noir and Hollywood references.",1393200000,,557,5.269662921348314

7884200,1,6305177945,"wouldn't ya know Lisa Kudrow is in it, i was shocked, but if your a Jason Priestley fan, it's not really worth it, because he's only in it in the first 10 min., but this movie is about a bunch of screen writers who are trying to come up with a story, based on one's idea, not too interesting.",1063497600,2,292,3.9661016949152543
7884201,1,6305177945,"If I was to rate this movie I would give it an 'R' for 'rubbish'. I pushed myself really hard to watch to the end. It is boring and sluggish with a poor storyline. I felt embarrassed for the well known cast - Stephen Rea, Illeana Douglas, John Ritter, Dave Foley, Robert Patrick and Tom Arnold. You wonder why I even have this movie in my collection? It's my 29th Robert Patrick video. My one star is for him.",987120000,,409,4.189873417721519
