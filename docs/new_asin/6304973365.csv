942120,4,6304973365,"I LOVE the video as its the only thing that reminds me of when the show was on TV. But they edited all the really funny parts, like when Venus keeps calling the sewer a ""toilet"". Overall, it's good, just requiring a little more drama. But I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the Ninja Turtles so much, and the girl Turtle idea was EXCELLENT. I just wish that the other episodes (NOT edited this time), would be on sale too.",998956800,,405,4.2727272727272725
942121,1,6304973365,"This movie is HORRIBLE (the shows were horrible). It was a bad attempt to resurrect Ninja Turtles. First off, the Ninja Turtles had only 4 turtles, and the idea of a girl turtle is just stupid (not that females are bad, it just ruins the Ninja Turtles). I am a teenager and I was an avid Ninja Turtle viewer and I love the Ninja Turtles, but when they remade it, that changed everything and it made it dumb. It insults my intelligence and everyone who watches it becomes dumber.",997142400,,478,4.382022471910112
942122,2,6304973365,"I can't believe this movie!!  It totally ruined the original three movies.  What's this nonsense about a fifth turtle named Shinobi?  There were only four turtles in the jar, not five like they said.  I am a teenager, and I started watching the turtles back when I was like five, so I take this personaly.  Oh well, I guess I would have to say to anyone reading this review, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!  If you really want to see it that bad, PLEASE RENT IT!!  Don't take word for it, it's not that it was a bad movie, it was just totally fake, and the camera work was awful.  Then the fifth turtle really got under my skin.",984787200,6,620,4.151260504201681
942123,3,6304973365,"TMNT did not need a next mutation.  They were just fine left alone and following Eeatman and Laird s foundation.  Don't worry the Turtles will be back, and they will be more popular than ever.  You see their core audience members are now teeagers and young adults, and they still think that they are cool.",981244800,,305,4.509090909090909
942124,2,6304973365,"Fox Kids did a terrable job of continuing the Turtles movies!  First of all, they never told us why the Shredder was still alive!  Remember, he got  killed in Turtles II!  Even if he was still alive, he sould have been the  Super Shredder!  Second, the costumes stunk!  Finally, the new villins were  stupid!  This is probably why the show got canceled on it's first season!  If I were anybody, I would get the three TRUE Turtles movies and exclude  this one!",967766400,,459,4.475609756097561
942125,4,6304973365,"NT: Next Mutation movie, East meets West, was very good in my point. For any Turtle fan it is a must get, seeing as NT: NM cannot be seen on Television any more. This was the only movie made of it. I would give it 4  stars, because It included the first 4 or 5 NT: NM episodes. There was one  bad thing though. They cut out some main parts. For example, they didn't  show the part where the Turtles named the girl turtle Venus. Also, In a  part where Michaelangelo crashs into the wall, Leonardo is in the  background holding his head....and it didn't show how Leo got his head hurt.  Overall, it is a must see for any TMNT fan, its not available in stores, so  buy it at Amazon while you still can!",949190400,6,699,4.095588235294118
7879864,5,6304973365,Looked for this movie for 5 years before I finally found it on here. It's a bit corny but a necessary addition to any TMNT collection.,1376611200,,134,4.1923076923076925
7879865,5,6304973365,My daughter has been a TMNT fan since she was very small. I have been searching and searching for a copy of this DVD and to find it was a blessing. She will be thrilled when she gets it for Christmas. I love the fact that I received it in about a week and that it had a little note about the blessings of Jesus Christ was a  plus in my eyes. Thanks!!!,1291334400,2,351,3.808219178082192
7879866,4,6304973365,"I have read alot of reviews about people complaining about this movie. Saying things like ""the acting is bad"" or ""where is April?"" First of all, this movie was a new take on the Ninja Turtles, not a means to offend all us people that grew up with them. As far as the story line and acting go in this movie, its stupid and overly drawn out I admit, but what do all of you expect from the same people that made the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers?

It is a rather stupid (and too long) movie, but its still the turtles people.

Everything that has come out new about the turtles gets nagged and complained about because its not what we all grew up with. I say, enough with the darn complaining. If you like the old stuff thats fine, I do too. I still watch the old cartoon on DVD. Long story short, Theres nothing wrong with this ""Next Mutation"" movie series, its just different. Like all the other variations of the turtles over the years. Just stop complaining, and get over it.

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will live forever in all our hearts, but we have to face facts, that we all have to go through changes in our lives, even them. They started out as comic books, and they have really come a long ways since then.",1275436800,,1220,4.2727272727272725
7879867,1,6304973365,"I Hated this movie, it was nothing like the other 3 movies that were great!  I do not recommend this movie!",1252713600,,107,4.095238095238095
7879868,3,6304973365,"Being a Turtles fan, I had heard of The Next Mutation.  Not much of what I heard was very flattering, but I was still curious.  Hence, when I saw it for sale here, I had to watch it for myself.  My verdict?  I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked it.  However, I don't like it as much as the rest of the series, nor do I like it in entirely the same way.

When Splinter inexplicably falls ill and not even Donatello can figure out what's wrong with him, the Turtles must delve into the Realm of Dreams in search of a cure.  But there is danger there, too; an ancient race of dragons, imprisoned by a line of mystics, lays in wait for someone to give them an opening to return to Earth.  With the help of one of these mystics- a female turtle they nickname Venus- the boys set out to save Splinter, and the world, from the vengeful wrath of the dragons.

There were two things I really enjoyed about East Meets West: the choreography and the puppets.  The fight scenes are a blend of martial arts and slapstick, and the environments, whether they be zoos or playgrounds, are used to full advantage.  I was expecting something sentai-derivative, so the strength of the battles was a nice surprise.  The puppets and dragon costumes, too, were better than I was expecting from a television series, especially one this old; also, the sets use color well, and the whole thing is quite polished.  That's not to say I didn't like the story.  Taken as its own separate thing, it has a distinctive atmosphere and a competent plot, and aside from a few off lines of dialogue, is not bad at all.

That's the key, though: taken as a separate thing.  Aside from a token nod to the rivalry between Raphael and Leonardo, this just doesn't gel with other TMNT continuities, and it does suffer from comparison.  Plot wise, it can't fit with the movies, cartoon, or comic, and though Shredder acquits himself admirably in his small cameo, the other characters do things that are bordering on out of character.  Also, since this is actually the first five episodes of a series, the smashed-together-as-a-movie version feels a little disjointed.

Ultimately, though, I had a lot more fun with it than I thought I would.",1230681600,2,2203,4.531645569620253
7879869,2,6304973365,"I liked it ok, considering I AM a hardcore Turtle fan and all, but I was expecting something more.  The style was too fake for me:  the costums, fighting, and such.  Shredder and the foot were a bit too.. too... I dunno dramic.  The actors drew out the scenes a bit too much.  The Dragons were more like idiots from hell, although I thought the scenes of them in the mirror were pretty cool.  Venus.... what's there to say about her?  She relays too much on her magical powers, gving me a bit of a turnoff.
And... were are the guys' BEDS!?  HELLO!  What about APIRL!?!?!  For crying out loud people!  Get a new director and costume designer as well as better actors!  Then I'll give ya' another heads up on what I think!  GEESH!",1074643200,2,728,4.303703703703704
7879870,3,6304973365,"Forget what anyone says about this being a Ninja Turtles movie.  This is not a movie!  It's the first 5 episodes of a short-lived live action Ninja Turtles TV show.  If you don't believe me, then check out the official website:  ...  This show wasn't as good as the original cartoon but it wasn't all bad.  However, I thought that bringing in a 5th turtle was a bad idea.  All Ninja Turtles fans know that there are only 4 and that's the way it should stay.",1059868800,2,457,4.244186046511628
7879871,2,6304973365,"If you have ever seen the Original Cartoons and The Original Ninja Turtle Movie you know that the story lines don't perfectly match, but at least they were close.  As a child you don't really care that much anyway.  But... I was shocked to See Shredder still alive and well.  The costume was terrible.  Splinter looked more fake than ever.
The only thing that was remotely the same as the other movies was the Turtles and some of the funny one liners. I don't mind that they added a girl turtle, but they should have fit her in the second movie. My 2 1/2 year old likes it just fine. This is not so good!  It's a tragic way to end such a fun childhood memory.",1045267200,2,659,4.198412698412699
7879872,5,6304973365,"This movie marked the return of the crimefighting quartet... with a new arrival from China! A Turtle named Venus! Despite being a reptile, Venus possesses mammary glands! Fun for the whole family! This movie utilized shots of a motorcyle driving through paper-littered streets. It utilized them again...and again...and again. If you want to see a turtle do this... you are in luck! Shredder is back, and stranger than ever. Then he quits. Splinter is much more spry. He used to be old and wizened, but now he hits people with a stick. Dragons are some tough hombres. The turtles must find a ''new way'' to overcome this threat. The new way is exactly like the old way. Oh well. I don't want to give away the ending, but not all the turtles survive this movie. If you have small kids, they might be traumatized by all the blood and sex. Otherwise, a fine film.",1027468800,2,859,4.584415584415584
7879873,2,6304973365,"I was one of those fans who actually WANTED a female turtle.  But Venus was just HORRIBLE!!!  A little naivity is one thing, but she was just plain ridiculous.
Also, why the changes in their masks?  Raphael's looked like somebody cut it out of a sheet of material with a butcher knife.
And . . . my biggest gripe . . . WHERE'S APRIL O'NEIL???",1017964800,,342,4.230769230769231
