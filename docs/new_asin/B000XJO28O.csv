8631162,1,B000XJO28O,"This was a terrible DVD. It's not a cartoon and it's just a little over 4 minutes long, the acting is horrible, there's no adventure, nothing. I would not recommend this dvd to anyone. All it was was some guy and girl talking and she gets a phone call from ""Daddy Odin"" and she leaves and that's the end of the movie. A real waste of money.",1270598400,,340,4.08955223880597
