7672425,1,B01C598L04,"Where to start.... Simply bad. To begin, the name Blood Lust simply doesn't quite fit this movie although there is blood and gore on a minimal level. I felt this movie was quite ""simple"", somewhat fairly written but poorly characterized and acted out. The story line was poorly written and executed. There was a mild Thrill factor to this movie. It is unclear what audience this movie was attempting to attract. There is not a clear niche in my opinion. I did watch the entire movie but it was challenging to keep my full attention. I simply did not like the movie and can't recommend it.",1472342400,,588,4.556603773584905
7672426,3,B01C598L04,"Dan's (Matt Silver) cheating wife (Chloe Partridge) gets murdered as Dan gets pipe wrenched to the head. He starts an on-line relationship with Callie (Rikke Leigh) who lives on an island with her two sisters, Lydia (Eloise Oliver) and Tess (Helen Rule). They are part of a group of Sirens who must lure men to their deaths to feast on their hearts. Dan eventually makes it to the island and Callie is a reluctant siren.

I love it when a film incorporates aspect of classic mythology or Shakespeare. I like it more when it is done well and doesn't have the worst narrator (Felice Gioia) imaginable for the film. Why does he have to have an irritating French accent? The thing that really irks me is they could of had someone else do it as the guy's lips never move. The second option is to leave the monologue out of the production altogether to allow the audience to figure it out for themselves. I enjoy a film when I get to do that myself rather than have the director think I am an idiot who needs to be spoon fed.

A film that would be far better with a slight tweak. C. Thomas Howell had a small role and Matt Silver needs to learn facial expressions.

Guide: F-word No sex or nudity. 2 1/2 stars",1464912000,5,1203,4.337777777777778
7672427,5,B01C598L04,"Ignore the cheesy cover, with its connotation of cannibalism, which is not essential to the plot. Similary, pass over the title, which has only a slight bearing on the movie. This movie is everything a low-budget horror film should be. It has elements of mythology and fantasy, too. Some of the actors are hams, appropriate to this genre. Some of the accents are ludicrous, also appropriate. The plot is brilliant, as is the male lead.",1463875200,3,435,4.8133333333333335
7672428,2,B01C598L04,"The scariest part of this movie is how bad C. Thomas Howell looks these days. His acting, well, that's always been awful so he fits in well here. And, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't Sirens supposed to be irresistible to men? Because none of these characters were remotely cast properly (that's a nice way of saying, not only are they not Sirens, they're not even attractive).

Sorry, but this is just another made-for-TV dud ""starring"" C. Thomas Howell. The only thing that could have made this worse is if Corbin Bernsen had made an appearance into the washed-up-actors-guild.",1473292800,,582,4.82
7672429,1,B01C598L04,"This movie was not even worth my 1 star rating...As a hardcore horror fan, I was really disappointed in being misled into watching this!!!

The plot was abhorrent, the composition was heinous -- and as for the acting -- I am certain that these actors were on a really low budget because no one gets paid $$$ to act that way.

An hour and a half of my life that I will clearly not get back!!!",1473292800,,391,4.131578947368421

8752267,4,B01C598L04,"This is a creepy, atmospheric, low budget film. In all those respects it is a success.  Everyone in this movie is a prop to move the story of the 3 sisters as slim as that story might be. The poster art places an undeserved emphasis on cannibalism.  I myself enjoyed the low key way it was handled as it added to the horror. Enjoy this little film, I know I did.",1475366400,,362,4.084507042253521
