On a few of the exercise progressions, they don't leave you with much time to get yourself ready for the next one...but as you do the DVD more and more - you know what's coming.  I definitely see and feel a change.",1438387200,,383,4.219178082191781
8420078,4,B004AE553E,"I bought this because my wife and I have been doing DVD 1 (mat) workout for well over a year and LOVE IT.  It's amazing how good of a workout you can get in 30 minutes.  The band workout was not as good... not the DVD but at least for me the bands themselves.  If you don't have access to weights or a Bowflex, then check it out, but don't expect similar results.",1421884800,,363,3.9452054794520546
8420079,5,B004AE553E,"Excellent upper body workout compliments my other Pilates for Men DVD:  The Challenge Mat Workout.  This DVD, The Challenge Band Workout uses resistance bands to work upper body and core muscle areas.  Very comfortable exercises with clear demonstrations and logical progressions, this workout is for anyone who wants to develop upper body muscle tone without over-straining upper body muscle groups.  I purchased Therabands (also through Amazon) to accompany this workout as their durability and reliable resistance factor works well with any elastic band exercise.  Now that I own 2 of the 3 DVDs in this Pilates for Men series, I can say with assurance that this approach to working out definitely supplements the other workouts I complete in order to maintain physical readiness.  Great DVD!  Highly recommend!",1396483200,,814,5.362204724409449

8420081,5,B004AE553E,"This workout uses the thera-band, (the flat, thin one, not the round tubing).  I sweated a bit, although I thought many of the exercise were fairly easy, possibly because I used the band to make it easier when I could.  Another reason is that this is a strength training workout so this may be a familiar and easier workout for those who are (or have been) weight training.
