And the characters in the movie are so believable that you can imagine yourself in their impossible situations. There are plenty of surprises in store too. We plan to watch it over and over.",1371513600,,280,4.73469387755102
5622913,5,B00BIAL8SO,Get ready for non-stop laughter! Great film for the whole family. A great story made up of five halarious groups visiting Yosemite. YES!,1371427200,,136,4.956521739130435

8568980,1,B00BIAL8SO,"Try reading WHO gave those 4 ""awards"" at the top of the box front cover.  You may need an electron microscope.  What a blatant ripoff.  Must be part of the sick joke?  Other than a few seconds of Yosemite footage edited in between The Dumb and Dumber-style B.S., this movie is not worth 5 cents Buy It Now on Ebay.  The Special Effect for the Firefall, which is thrown in as if some idiot realized during Post Production that they finally had a perfect title for this disgusting mess, would not qualify for a GIF found on BING (with image protection turned OFF) that was made by a 9 year old pervert.  It is s*** like this that killed The Krell on Forbidden Planet, and will probably bubble up to the top of a mile-deep garbage dump in 100,000 years, and the aliens who then own The Earth will decode it and play it at History Lessons to show what Humans were really like in the 21st century.  VIZ: History Lesson by the late Arthur C. Clarke.  Oh, I get it: the Cast just got together and wrote the Script, took out Second Mortgages on their houses, and told some Blu-ray manufacturer in a 4th-world country that their movie won 4 ""awards.""  My family is now considering doing the very same thing, just as soon as our lobotomies are completed.",1424563200,,1244,4.373913043478261

8568982,5,B00BIAL8SO,So funny and a pleasure to watch with all age groups in our family. This is one you can watch again for sure.,1404432000,,109,3.782608695652174
8568983,3,B00BIAL8SO,"Stars : Gregory Tharpe,Master Dave Johnson & Kopi Sotiropulos.
A Matt Sconce film.
Okay,It starts off depressing and confusing ,Trying to find a jump -off premise and then when we leave the city,Things get good.
The humor is not necessarily family friendly,Although the situations are very much so.
The humor is usually at an animals expense and very,very funny & original in outdoors settings.
The cast is very comfortable to watch and like a Whos who of Valleywood !
YOSEMITE PARK is filmed with great splendor and really feels like the set of a major motion picture.
We could see bringing the scottish duo back for more adventures and Rich Krebs is hilarious with a french bent.",1385164800,,681,4.829059829059829
8568984,5,B00BIAL8SO,loved the movie. It has great scenery and very fun plot. Bomb Bag of great fun and laughs. The National Park will never look the same again! It was all in fun!!,1381017600,,160,4.03125
8568985,4,B00BIAL8SO,"It's hard to find a movie that works for all family members- this movie has laughs for everyone. While the girls and I turned away for the potty-humor jokes, we managed to rewind the squirrel vs. cheese puff scene and watched it three times. Lots of colorful characters and gorgeous footage of Yosemite make Firefall an innocent escape from the standard comedy. Those kilt-wearing rock-climbers stole the show!",1374969600,,410,5.044117647058823
8568986,5,B00BIAL8SO,"The whole family enjoyed this movie.  While my kids were taken with the Cheesy-Poo scene (which they are still reenacting a week later), I enjoyed the obvious spoof humor.  The characters were fun:  The main character in this movie is a so-called  expert who wrote a book but can't practically apply any of it.  And who doesn't know someone like the guy that ""used to"" weightlift, or had some accomplishment 30 years ago that they just won't stop talking about?",1372377600,,461,4.7125
