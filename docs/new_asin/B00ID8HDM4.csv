8641102,1,B00ID8HDM4,"A very poorly filmed lecture about the ""paranormal"" in Arizona. Being residents of northern Arizona, my wife and I were hoping for more information on a number of topics that come up around here. None were touched upon. I must admit we only watched the first 40 minutes or so before we both cried ""BORING"" and shut it off. Hearing about the ancient Hopi villages on the three mesas and their correlation to the three stars of Orion's belt and the Egyptian pyramids was of little interest. Add to that the fact that you could barely make out the pictures and maps he was showing or see where he was pointing his laser pointer and you get a very disappointing waste of money. The ""cameraman"" seemed to feel it was more important to include the speaker on one side of the ""screen"" (who talked, nothing else) and the emergency light on the other side of the ""screen"" rather than zooming in on the pictures being shown and talked about. I would have preferred to see the pictures and maps and see what the speaker was pointing out with his laser.",1406851200,3,1041,4.484210526315789
