8221427,1,B000W7CL4O,"the way to do drum instructional video is to break it down slowly with the sheet music shown. neither of that is in here. latin beats are especially complicated, so I was hoping to get some instructions, but with this video, the instructor does not break anything down, and there's no drum charts/sheet music throughout. I could have bought a latin cd and tried to copy the sound, and that would have been cheaper. Basically, with this dvd, I have to transcribe everything by ear. Not helpful at all. Plus, the first thing that the instructor says is an error- e.g. he says he is going to play an eighth note on the hi-hat, and starts playing 16th note. Not a big deal, but this makes him look like an idiot right off the bat.",1401494400,,726,4.385185185185185
8221428,5,B000W7CL4O,"Very nice and well done
Not a single note is wasted like most instructional DVD's
Really full of wisdom. thumbs up",1359504000,,114,4.476190476190476
8221429,3,B000W7CL4O,This DVD is NOT NTSC as advertised. It does not play on normal DVD players. It did play in my Mac computer.,1230508800,,107,3.909090909090909
8221430,4,B000W7CL4O,"This is a great instructional video but beware. This DVD is actually in PAL format. It will only play if you have a DVD player that can handle both PAL and NTSC formats (multisystem). The player also needs to be region free. The box didn't say what format it was in so it was pain to figure out the problem.

I have 4 DVD players (Sony, Pioneer, jWin, and a Toshiba 7"" portable).  It will only play on the portable Toshiba and the jWin (which is, ironically, a really cheap $30 model).  On the Toshiba 7"" LCD screen the picture is fine.  But on a regular set, the picture quality isn't that good because of the PAL conversion.

Otherwise, the actual content is fantastic and the instructional method first-rate.  The PAL format is the only thing that kept me from leaving 5 stars especially when it's listed here on Amazon as being NTSC.",1208217600,2,837,4.437908496732026
8221431,5,B000W7CL4O,"This video shows various Latin Percussion Paterns (cascara, clave, etc)
and then most importantly,shows how to apply them to drumset.
Excelent. Watch it. Then be prepared to practice it.
