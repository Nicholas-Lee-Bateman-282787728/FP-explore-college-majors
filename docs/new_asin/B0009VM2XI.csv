8078904,1,B0009VM2XI,"This DVD is unavailable at Amazon.  Do yourself a favor and don't look for it elsewhere.  The DVD was apparently ported from a tape, and the instruction was below-par to start with.  There is no menu, there is no accompanying booklet, and the instruction is tedious.  You will be better off with instructional DVDs by Ralph Shaw, Jim Beloff, or Roy Sakuma.  There are others as well, but these are arguably the best of the bunch currently available.  Although not discussed here, there are also some good DVDs designed specifically for kids.  Happy plunking!",1246665600,,558,4.872340425531915
8078905,2,B0009VM2XI,I think you would be much better spending your money elsewhere.  I find the video to basic for just about anyone.  My opinion.,1239408000,,126,4.434782608695652
