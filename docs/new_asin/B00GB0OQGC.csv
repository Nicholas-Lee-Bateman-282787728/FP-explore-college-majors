6069277,3,B00GB0OQGC,It's ok dub and not to funny. But it has no ending it doesn't finish the story so if you like pointless episodes with little plot devolpment you might like this.,1391299200,,161,4.225806451612903
6069278,5,B00GB0OQGC,"Disclaimer: I legally obtained this before release date. I'm not some ""hardcore"" ""Japanese dub = only dub guy"", but I've watched a very considerable amount of anime, with this show being a notable guilty pleasure.

Short Version:
  If you're a fan of the show, buy this. The new English dub is good, and even if it's not to your liking, you can listen
  in Japanese with subtitles. Plus... look at that 1080p goodness.
  If you've never watched it, but are in the mood for a comedy, I'd definitely recommend the show.
  It was well worth the watch.

Long Version:
  The Package:
  MM! comes in an ordinary BD case with a fairly nice slip cover.
  Disc 1 is 40GB and houses episodes 1-9 along with a commentary (episode 1) with the original Mio and Arashiko.
  Disc 2 is a bit shy of 20GB and has episodes 10-12 along with all the specials (Short Stories, and hidden camera shorts)
  Aside from the two discs, nothing else is in it.
  The Story: Reading the synopsis, I expected the show to be awful, but ended up loving the humor and story-line.
  The Video: 5/5
  Pro: The 1080p video looks awesome and is miles ahead of that disappointing American DVD release by Sentai.
  4.5GB episodes.
  Con: None.
  Note: I compared this to the Japanese Blu-rays. Initially, it seemed like this release had more artifacts and a bit
  more grain. However, after switching playback methods, I realized the new artifacts were an unfortunate effect
  unique to that one BD drive. Video is essentially the same.
  The Audio: 5/5
  Pro: Good cast and the new English dialog stays true to the Japanese dub while providing laughs.
  Con: Only Stereo 2.0 and the dynamic range isn't anything impressive.
  Note: English Mio is growing on me. I doubt I'll even use the Japanese dub now.",1390348800,9,1766,4.630718954248366
6069279,2,B00GB0OQGC,"Personally i liked when it was subbed because it was amazing and wanted it to be dubbed in the most epic way possible but from the streams i saw on it being dubbed, i was extremely disappointed especially episode 6 at the ending, a different phrase would have made that episode perfect

Other than that the sub's are great and a must for any hardcore anime fan",1389571200,,360,4.373134328358209
6069280,5,B00GB0OQGC,pretty awesome anime if i were to recommend this to someone i would but anyone under the age of 18 would probably have to look else where.,1388966400,3,138,4.148148148148148
6069281,5,B00GB0OQGC,"I watched the subbed version and all I can say is AWSOME!!! The lead male wants his machonistic tendency to be cured and the president of the service club is nothing more than a hard core sadist herself who thinks if she inflicts enough pain that will cure him....RIGHT....so the verbal and physical abuse is non stop from her....but he loves it. The other girl is so terrified by men that if U breath on her U get punched but then again she is the one who turned him into a machosits. But the funniest parts are when he needs his ""henti"" power boosted he just calls the president certian things and literly presses all the correct buttons and she falls for it hook line and sinker!!! Fair warning this IS NOT FOR UNDER 18 by ANY MEANS. There is no ""fan service"" but there doesnt need to be. Let me put it this way...I love it when Joe Peshi in mob movies goes on a cursing rampage but this chick puts him in the PEE WEE league!!! If you were looking for something on the line of ""Pet Girl"" or ""Listen to me girls Im your father"" then U DEFINATELY came to the wrong page!!!!",1388707200,3,1074,4.218446601941747
6069292,5,B00GB0OQGC,"Painful show if you just an anime fan. If you are a Sado Masochist this is this show to get. Yes, this show has Ayana in it, that means you get it.",1430524800,,147,3.625

6069297,5,B00GB0OQGC,"The characters with their problems make it interesting enough, but watching them trying to solve them really left me speechless. I enjoyed their outtake on their own situations and how they tried to overcome the obstacles that were in their way. Some were practical, while others left you wondering who told them this would work. Still, each episode had me laughing and looking forward to the next adventure. I hope it continues because I want at least my problem of closure for this series to be solved even if all of the rest of them don't get theirs fixed.",1409011200,,559,4.656565656565657

6069299,5,B00GB0OQGC,"This show is really funny, At first I just bought it to see what it was like but im glad I did, If you havnt picked this up or not sure go ahead you'll enjoy it. I think blu ray is only one dubbed.",1400803200,,197,3.5
6069300,5,B00GB0OQGC,It got here pretty darn quick!! What i got is what i ordered. It looks lovely and im super happy with it :) its in perfect condition of course as well :) *thumbs up!* by the way this anime is pretty darn funny. Give it a try!,1396742400,,225,3.8085106382978724
6069301,1,B00GB0OQGC,"MM's ""story"" revolves around Taro Sado a masochist who is trying to overcome his problem with the help of a school club, in that club we get the generic characters of every anime now these days, we have the shy girl, the loli, the main character's lackey and of course the annoying Tsundere (bipolar) character, and of course we get the final two episodes that try to be more of a drama than a comedy.

One warning to you if you are thinking in buying this collection, the character Yuno (purple hair) really is the major problem of this show, she is afraid of men for an incident that we see in one episode, but that didn't stop her for getting close to Taro and then punch him several times on the face and say the phrase ""I'm afraid of Men"".  The first two times when she punched him were funny, BUT they used this same mediocre joke in every episode, that's right EVERY episode not once but sometimes FOUR times, that is simply annoying and lazy writing.

Pros
- English dub.
- Animation is good, but it's not near the level of Kanokon.
- Taro Sado
- Taro's sister and mother.

Cons
- Tsundere character Mio.
- The character Yuno really is annoying and without her this show could be re-watchable, but once she appears you already know she is gonna do the same stupid joke of punching the main character in the face and say ""I'm afraid of Men"".
- Music is generic.
- No story / plot.
- no fan service, coming from Xebec I was expecting another Kanokon or To love-ru, but no, no nudity or service at all, just the again generic ""beach episode"".
- OVA shorts don't even have innuendo.

That in mind if the humor it's not coming from Taro or Taro's relatives the humor is as bland as enjoying a bowl full rice, and that's sad because this show would have been great if only they focused on Taro, his sister and mother, but no, the result another generic comedy. This show was not worthy of a dub, there are way better shows to dub, what ever happened to ""And yet the town moves"", or ""He is my master""? I like the idea of a dub for Maria Holic and Special A, but really MM is one of those shows that becomes annoying after the first episode.  1 out of 5.",1392076800,2,2154,4.254278728606357
8621751,3,B00GB0OQGC,"Way too violent for my taste! It has some nudity and comedy but there are better shows like Cat Planet Cuties, Naikimo: My Sister Is Among Them or Queen's Blade: Rebellion!!!",1493164800,,174,4.645161290322581
8621752,5,B00GB0OQGC,"I really liked this anime. The humor that resides in every episode is always equalled out by something stupid or violent, and i really don't mind the little romantic scenes that occasionally pop up.",1485043200,,198,4.852941176470588

8621756,5,B00GB0OQGC,This guy Taro is trying to get rid of his super massacism to confess to the girl of his dreams and when the time comes to confess he finds out that....whoa...almost spoiled it...anyway...funny anime filled with what most people would consider awkward moments,1453939200,,258,5.023255813953488
8621757,4,B00GB0OQGC,"I'm giving it four stars I would give it less but since, I'm not the target audience for this anime; dropping the star ratings would be misleading.

I'm not a masochist person so the humor in this anime wasn't superb for me. (I actually felt bad for the protagonist getting beat up all the time.)

I really did enjoyed the heroic scenes, and the story, yet I was expecting it to be less humiliating to the main character, which its my main drawback.

Don't do the same mistake as me, make sure your the appropriate audience. I hope this helps.",1450742400,,543,4.41
