4570948,5,B0054TOTOU,On days that I just want to have a good time playing the guitar without getting to technical these cd's come to mind. John makes even the simple metal lessons fun and if you follow him you will improve. THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.,1401667200,,222,4.309523809523809
4570949,5,B0054TOTOU,"I'm still in the beginning stages of going through this set of DVDs but that's due more to time constraints than anything else. I've been playing for years but decided to get these because I felt my playing and techniques were stagnant. While I haven't gone through much of the course what I have gone through I can say is really good. I have actually really expanded my use of the whole fretboard in the little time I've had to work with this. All in all I would recommend it, not for a very advanced player, but if you're new to metal or a beginner I think you would be hard pressed to not find something useful in the course.",1395532800,2,628,4.241666666666666
4570950,5,B0054TOTOU,"The dvds contain a lot of info. McCarthy teaches at a good pace, and shows both right and left hand when needed. Website access also cool.",1390953600,4,138,4.346153846153846
4570951,5,B0054TOTOU,"he is a good teacher  ,i've bought  many dvd tutorials  and this one  is very good ,i have finish disc one , i still has to go through the other two, but i have good vibes",1389830400,2,171,3.6666666666666665

4570953,5,B0054TOTOU,One of the best dvd lessons ive ever seen. The instructor was very knowlegable. Everything was easy to understand. The online help is great. I would recommend this lesson to everyone.,1357344000,5,183,4.935483870967742
4570954,5,B0054TOTOU,"I've got about 5 months of lessons on acoustic guitar doing basic chords, scales, 3 chord songs, etc. It was fun but I want to rock! This DVD set has been awesome...I'm working my new electric guitar over on the first disc, over and over again... it's clear, concise, and makes you feel like you're actually playing. Scales become possibilities for lead guitar riffs instead of boring practice. The ability to play with backup drums/bass is awesome for timing and precision. I'll buy the Rock version soon because this stuff is working. Practice makes perfect but practicing with tools like these makes real progress possible... which makes practice something you want to do!!",1341878400,13,676,4.991150442477876
4570955,5,B0054TOTOU,"FINALLY a DVD guitar instructional that makes sense! I was so impressed with this set I also bought the 3-disc set for Rock guitar as well. John is a top notch instructor. The video shows plenty of close up shots and slows down enough so that you can see what he is doing. Tab is also included through the DVD. You must print it yourself. (Roughly 35-40 pages) My guitar playing has sky rocketed since practicing with these videos one hour a day. Like anything, you MUST practice to get better. I will now only buy Rock Guitar Method Videos. Thanks John Mccarthy for your help in teaching the art of shred and Metal guitar. Keep Rockin'",1331078400,12,636,4.444444444444445

4570967,4,B0054TOTOU,"They recording quality is a tad better then my old guitar VCR tapes, so you might strain to watch his fingers. Just like my old VCR tapes the sound comes through. A 3 is probably more accurate but I know these musicians put their heart in these things so I give them the benefit of a higher score.",1422230400,2,297,4.137931034482759
4570968,5,B0054TOTOU,This is an awesome mega pack!! No need to waste money on guitar lessons while owning this. If you buy this mega pack then don't buy the Lead Guitar DVD featuring John McCarthy because the third disc of this mega pack is the same as the lead guitar DVD.,1420934400,8,252,4.163265306122449

8457099,2,B0054TOTOU,"I thought out of the 3 cds, there were maybe 2 or 3 things useful to the advanced guitarist. Other than that, this should be a newbie training system. Dude, John was killing me with that awful sounding telecaster on disc 1.",1453680000,2,223,4.333333333333333
8457100,4,B0054TOTOU,"This is a really good beginner's set. The first couple of discs take you by the hand and walk you through the instruction as if you've never held a guitar in your entire life. By the third disc, he starts giving you some really decent exercises, though.

Knocked one star off for video quality. Looks like it may have been converted from VHS or something, I don't know. It's not so terrible that you can't work with it; however, it is noticeable. I wouldn't let that stop you from getting this set if you are looking for something that will help you start playing the guitar. Even if you aren't a total beginner, some of the stuff on the third disc is still useful.

All-in-all, two thumbs up. This resource can help you if you are willing to put in the time to practice every day.",1444521600,5,781,4.342465753424658
