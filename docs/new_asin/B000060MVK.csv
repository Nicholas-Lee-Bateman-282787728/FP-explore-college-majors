1682266,5,B000060MVK,"Jeremy Brett is the best rendition of Sherlock Holmes I have seen yet. This series is produced quite well, and the acting is Top-Notch! Jerremy's little personal touches make him a joy to watch on screen. While the special features are not exactly exciting, they are worth it for true die-hard sherlock fanatics. Buy the Full BoxSet rather than individually like i did. it's cheaper and you get everything anyway.",1023148800,,413,4.914285714285715
1682267,4,B000060MVK,"Grenada's Sherlock Holmes series are, for my money, the finest adaptations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's detective stories ever filmed, or likely to be.  The casting, locations, scripting, direction and atmosphere are beyond reproach.  Grenada's aim was to create the definitive Sherlock Holmes, and so they did.  Sadly, Jeremy Brett passed away with some twenty of the stories remaining to film, and in the last several shows his illness made him almost painful to watch.... but in this first series of Adventures, he's at the top of his game, as is David Burke, who is the perfect Watson to go with Brett's perfect Holmes.
I wish I could be as enthusiastic about MPI's treatment of the series on disc.  The extras are all fine, but Disc One has some distressingly bad sound quality, and the video transfer quality on all the discs is uniformly poor.  It makes one wish very strongly that A&E had gotten the DVD rights, as their treatment of such classics as MONTY PYTHON and THE AVENGERS is top-notch.  It is the quality control problems on these discs that keep me from awarding the full five stars.
That having been said: for the Sherlock Holmes fan, this series is worth having on disc whatever the shortcomings.",1022976000,42,1215,4.7894736842105265
1682268,5,B000060MVK,"This boxed set of 5 DVDs contains the first outstanding 13 episodes (which aired 1984-85) of the acclaimed Grenada TV series (1984-94) starring Jeremy Brett (3 Nov. 1933-12 Sep. 1995) as Holmes and David Burke (born 25 May 1934) as Watson (Edward Hardwicke, born 7 Aug. 1932, played Watson on the remaining episodes). This series totaled 41 episodes: 36 episodes (ca. 50-55 minutes each) in 6 series plus 5 double-length episodes (The sign of four, The hound of the Baskervilles, and three very deviant episodes: The master blackmailer, The last vampyre, and The eligible bachelor). The boxed set is of the first 2 TV series entitled ""Adventures"" and does not correspond to the ""Adventures"" of the published short stories.
 The ""Adventures"" DVD box is a four-part plastic affair and not simply 5 DVD cases that slip into a large cardboard box. The six-page booklet simply lists ""chapter selections"" and bonus materials. Disappointingly, the booklet lacks the brief plot summaries and episode pictures on the back covers of the individually sold volumes. Volume 1 is a two-sided disk with 4 episodes and corrects the defect of the original volume 1 where Side A was B and Side B was A. The warbling sound on ""The dancing men"" is inherent with the source material. Volumes 2-5 are one-sided disks (with 3 episodes on volume 5) that bear a curious design in the 3:00 position that looks like a surface defect but isn't. Picture quality is very good, especially considering that the series was filmed in 16mm.
 It took MPI one and a half years to release these first 13 episodes. This is only about 28.2% of the total series (not counting two short episodes). One hopes that the remaining 23 single-length and 5 double-length episodes are issued more expeditiously (the complete series has been available in Japan for well over a year). ...",1022976000,218,1836,4.90032154340836
1682269,5,B000060MVK,"This is one of the very best adaptations of the Sherlock holmes story. In my opinion the best. Many people prefer peter cushing as sherlock holmes, But I personally feel Jeremy Brett is without a doubt the best. These were shot in London, in authentic backgrounds. Jeremy is a perfect Holmes. He has just the right attitude and ""jerky bird"" appearance and manner described in the literature. If you started as a reader of Holmes, as I did, this will be your choice for The cinematic versions. My absolute highest reccomendation.",1022544000,6,528,4.813186813186813
1682270,5,B000060MVK,"Mr. Broomfield, who wrote a review here saying this box set has misleading information, is wrong.  Granada made several groups of Holmes stories.  They were called: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Return of Sherlock Holmes, The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, etc...  This box set is in fact ALL the episodes that were in ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" group of episodes.  There were more episodes that hopefully will be released on DVD in the future.",1022457600,12,461,5.026315789473684
1682271,4,B000060MVK,Although Brett is not by a far stretch my favorite actor in the Holmes role (my personal preference is for Basil Rathborne) these television adaptations did sport fine writing and production design while remaining solidly faithful to the source material. At a cost less than half that of some other television series are charging for their seasons (Picard anyone) this set would appear to be a steal and essential for anyone collection.,1022025600,3,436,5.069444444444445
1682272,5,B000060MVK,"For my money Jeremy Brett will always be the definitive screen Holmes. In addition, these Granada TV adaptations employed fine writing that hewed faithful to the original stories and nifty production values in sets, costumes, etc. It's a shame that the ""extras"" (cast bios and stills) are so skimpy, but the episodes themselves should be considered essential for Holmes fans and collectors. This box set of 13 episodes on 5 discs comes at a better price than the individual volumes purchased seperately, an unhappy situation for those who have been buying the volumes as they were released, but a boon for those who've held off until now. There's no excuse now : get these DVDs.",1013731200,29,678,4.904347826086957

1682439,5,B000060MVK,"I have always been a Sherlock Holmes fan, when I was a kid I always loved watching any old ""Holmes"" movie that would come on the tv. My love of Sherlock Holmes stories kind of laid dormant for many years while I was caught up in working and raising a family but, I have a little more time on my hands these days for such things. When the movie with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law came out the flame was reignited and I haven't been able to get enough Sherlock Holmes since.

My first introduction to Jeremy Brett as the master ""consulting detective"" came when I downloaded a movie called ""The Master Blackmailer"", I was immediately drawn in and realized that Robert Downey Jr. had based his style of portraying Sherlock Holmes on Brett's style and while I love the way Downey pulled it off, Brett has him beat.

Once my passion for Sherlock Holmes stories was reignited I purchased the books with all the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and enjoyed every one of them. Anyone who has enjoyed any of the movies really should give the books a shot, they are really quite enjoyable reading.

From there I purchased the other four Movies that Brett made along with costar Edward Hardwicke as Dr John Watson, who does an outstanding job of portraying Watson properly in my opinion. Far too many times we see Watson portrayed as a bumbling idiot in those old movies when he was actually far from it, he doesn't have Holmes' genius but, he is far from an idiot.

After I had watched those movies a few times I needed another fix so, I moved on to this first season of the Granada television series and I have to say that it was worth every penny of the purchase price. These stories, (along with the Brett movies), are done very well with regards to staying true to the original stories, which is something we don't see too often when books are made into movies and I, for one, am quite happy when someone gets it right.

In this season David Burke plays Watson and while he does a good job he also kind of tends to make Watson a bit of a dummy, not nearly as bad as say, Nigel Bruce, but still, as I said before, Watson was not a dummy. Burke does do an admirable job overall though.
I really love Brett's portrayal of Holmes, watching the way he does this series brings the man off the page and onto our screens, I don't think anyone will ever be a better Sherlock Holmes than Jeremy Brett, he fit the role perfectly and he played the role the same. I don't believe anyone will ever do it better.

So, if you're a fan of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle tales of Sherlock Holmes then ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Season 1"" is a must watch in my humble opinion.",1475625600,7,2665,4.341365461847389

However, if you have a good familiarity with the original stories, you will find the portrayals of the characters extremely pleasing. Jeremy Brett performs the quirks from the stories with startling verisimilitude. He doesn't just play Holmes, it feels like he truly becomes Holmes.

Both David Burke (1st season) and Edward Hardwicke (rest of the run) give us a Watson who is a fitting associate for the great detective and as written by Conan-Doyle; very much the Victorian Brit, but highly intelligent and constantly following his friend's lead to rise above the narrow-mindedness of the times. Watson is and should be a man of imagination and a great sense of adventure. One sees clearly, too, that Holmes would not have been able to thrive without his personal physician watching over him and sometimes actively forcing him to take some care of his health. The Scotland Yarders and other police are also shown as they were written.

Obviously the series was well helmed. With that, and with Jeremy Brett, this must and will always stand as the quintessential Sherlock Holmes.",1472774400,5,1193,4.930348258706467

All of the new versions of Masterpiece productions can be had through various outlets but they are quite pricey if purchased beginning season 1.  So the rarity does pay off at the cost of the poor public. As a period piece the earlier series available through Amazon with Jeromy Bret is full of atmosphere and authenticity common in each masterful episode. Like ""The Greek Interpreter"" the whole original series is first class.  The plentiful PBS trailers of the newer versions of Arther Conan Doyle's classics seem to suggest the same attention to excellence, but Jeromy Bret is a hard act go follow.",1452038400,2,819,4.963503649635037

1682676,5,B000060MVK,"A classic collection of fabulous episodes performed by my all time favorite Holmes actor, Jeremy Brett. I have these episodes on DVD, but since DVD quality seems really hit and miss these days, it's nice to have them on Amazon Prime where they are always available and always in fine working order. I've been watching these on my Galaxy S5 and they look so super crisp and sharp compared to what I see when I play DVD's on my PC. I snuggle in to bed, pop in the headphones, prop my phone up next to my pillow on my desk and let Holmes and Watson transport me to Victorian England for my all time favorite mysteries.

While the collection of tales in ""The Adventures"" is not my favorite, that's not due to any lack of quality or performance by the cast and crew that produced this set. They are all of the highest caliber, but the tales told in ""The Return of"" just happen to be stories which rank higher in my personal list of favorite Holmes tales. But that's sort of like saying I'd like 5 billion dollars better than 4.9 billion dollars. :)

If you enjoy Holmes and you enjoy Brett's Holmes, the SD version on Amazon Instant Video should surely please, especially when played on small devices. If you're concerned it might not look good on your larger format screen, try renting one episode, give it a try and judge for yourself. The HD season price is not much more than the SD, so if it will matter to you, by all means, go the extra mile.

1682746,5,B000060MVK,"I remember watching these British shows on US PBS in the 1980s. I was impressed then that this was the first portrayal of these stories in a serious and trustworthy way. They have stood up very well over time.

Jeremy Bret plays the best Holmes I have seen. He's a bit jerky in his moves, and a little snippy, but that appears to be his interpretation. After all, Holmes is supposed to have aquiline features, so acting quick like a bird, an eagle, is appropriate.

But it is Watson who is so good. Gone is the Watson of Nigel Bruce in the Basil Rathbone movies of the 30s and 40s. Bruce played Watson then as a buffoon, not at all the character in the books. Rathbone was even more exaggerated than Brett as Holmes. Perhaps our sense were less discriminate then and we needed more contrast and exaggeration to pierce our understanding of these characters.

I believe that ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" was the first book. It does appear that the series mixes the stories. But, as I remember them, these stories seem faithful to the original.

As period piece drama, these stories are excellent. It is quite easy to imanine oneself back in Edwardian England. Everything looks right and feels right. Mrs Hudson is superb.

I find a place for such shows as ""Sherlock"" and ""Elementary"", after such descents as in the ""7% Solution"" and the Robert Downey efforts. These stories, tyo me, remain the ones to aim for. I can understand wanting to change things up, but I appreciate sticking to the stories that have endured.",1428710400,,1521,4.639405204460966

1682860,5,B000060MVK,"Until blu-ray.com releases a more detailed review on this set, I'll do my best to describe how amazing these blu-rays look and sound.

VIDEO: I just finished watching ""Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" (I only got Adventures & Return, because I felt the later episodes and movies would depress me too much: seeing Jeremy Brett in his final, unhealthy days in life) and I can gladly say that it was very easy to get distracted by how beautifully remastered this 3-disc blu-ray edition looks. It seems rather evident that those behind this HD transfer took a lot of care into reviving this show. Skin tones were incredibly life-like and consistent, full of warm pinks and reds that contrasted gorgeously against blacks and grays. And speaking of blacks and grays, several shots that shown Holmes/Brett sitting in a dark room, in his mostly black attire, struck me with such subtle force as to notice not only the cinematography, but how solidly black the transfer's black levels were. There were never signs of edge glow or banding (at least not to my eyes); black was very black from corner to corner, shot to shot, and only Brett's candle-lit hands and face popped out with great sharpness and focus. Close-ups (pretty much any close-ups) revealed even more detail that I'm sure wasn't visible on the DVD edition (or any previous editions for that matter). I frequently noticed how textures on cloth would be so fine that I felt quite proud to have ever gotten a 1080p TV in the first place. You could notice for yourselves, the individual strands of hair in eyebrows and mustaches, the very fabric of an actor's costuming (which looked incredibly expensive and of high quality), and especially, in outdoor scenes-oh, those beautifully vivid (surprising, for an older, British-made TV program) outdoor scenes-the leaves in trees and bushes, and blades of grass. Seriously, I can't stress enough how wonderfully refocused and resharpened everything looks. Grass outside is so green and luscious that I can't help but feel awed by it, the streets outside 221B exhibit many different shades of gray, with hints of brown and blue and whatever colors you'd find in stone, and everything just looks so masterfully handled, from a visual, technical point of view. Finally, grain is ever present (as it should be, for an 80s TV show), but never overbearing. It looks natural and even enhances the ""feel"" of the Victorian atmosphere. If any smoothing of textures was done, it's unnoticeable.
Perfect 5/5. Quite possibly the best-looking edition of this series available.

AUDIO: I'll keep this shorter. Audio comes in the form of lossless 2.0 LPCM sound. Some wonderful low-frequency effects come out every once in a while, such as gunshots, horse-hoofs (hooves?) clopping on London pavements, etc. But the real standout is that dialogue is always clear and audible. No hisses or cracks were ever apparent. Silence was actually silent. Everything is well-balanced between channels and, as a lover of high quality blu-rays and this show, I was thoroughly pleased with how sound has been dealt with. One wonderful example that sticks in my memory is actually from the first episode of ""Return of Sherlock Holmes"", ""The Empty House"", where all is completely silent and Watson's pistol is slowly being cocked and readied. The sound is so isolated and clear that it perfectly expresses a feeling of tension by itself. A few moments later, the antagonist is assembling a rifle in the same room, and the sound of weaponry being tinkered with is just so clearly and dynamically separated from the surrounding silence that the contrast is strikingly suspenseful.
Another 5/5.

SPECIAL FEATURES: ""Adventures"" comes with a short ""vintage promo"" that's not all that special. Aside from that, you'll have to be content with the (in my opinion) flawless audio/visual remastering, which I'm sure you will be.
1.5/5

OVERALL: Whether you get select seasons/series or the complete series blu-ray compilation, I don't doubt that you'll be impressed by the quality of these discs. Such revival is essential, I think, to re-immersing us fans into the world of Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes. RIP Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke.

The secret to the success of this series was the portrayal of Holmes by Jeremy Brett, who remains for most fans as one of the most popular actors to don the deerslayer's cap and smoke the pipe.  Brett seems to have actually read all the books and does a great job of capturing the odd, antisocial but genius quirks of the detective.  The screenplays and productions try to stay close to the original stories, without the over-embellishment of some of the cinema versions.  Of course, the productions are modest in budget and have to cut some corners, but Brett wins the day and the audience.

Dr. Watson is portrayed not as a bumbling fool, but as the educated man he would have to be in order to be a physician. I love the new show, SHERLOCK, and adore Benedict Cumberbatch.

  These episodes are direct adaptions of Conan Doyle's timeless works, with only mild changes of necessity due to the change in mediums--page to screen. The costumes are glorious, the sets magnificent--you BELIEVE it's all real; it doesn't look like a set.

  I won't go into summaries; it is likely you know the stories, and I dare not spoil them for anyone who doesn't. All I can say is that these are the most truthful and masterful adaptations of the original stories I have ever had the pleasure to watch.
The supporting cast is brilliant--especially Rosalie Williams as Mrs. Hudson!

  Watson--or shall I say the Watsons? Because there are two different Watsons--is brilliantly portrayed by David Burke, then later by Edward Hardwicke in a seemingly flawless transition. David Burke plays Watson as a man constantly impressed with Holmes--his portable audience as it were--I quite enjoyed it; it reminds me of how Watson speaks of Holmes in the stories. Edward Hardwicke's Watson older, and is less amazed with Sherlock and more merely tolerant of his eccentricities; he also seems to realize that Sherlock must be cared for or he'll burn himself out--which is also quite in line with Watson in the stories as he often despairs of Sherlock's disregard for his own health and well-being. Bravo to both Watsons--I cannot choose a favorite.

  Now for Jeremy Brett's Sherlock.

  Jeremy Brett's definitive portrayal of one of the greatest literary characters of all time--Sherlock Holmes--has, for me, eclipsed all others. Not one Sherlock I have ever seen can compare to him.(Before everyone freaks out I must say that I love Sherlock in all his incarnations and mean no disrespect to any other portrayals. Because every Sherlock has their virtues.)He IS Sherlock, there is no other way to describe it. Every nuance, every habit, every motion, every word that Sherlock has ever said--is evident in Jeremy's performance. The rapid changes in mood; the frenetic bursts of energy followed by lethargy; the constant control of emotions, and the fleeting, tantalizing glimpses of Sherlock's heart; the rapidity of his singular brain; the sometimes blatant disregard for his own safety; those lovely monologues of pure deduction, given in that offhand way--in Jeremy's beautiful, modulated, perfect diction; the addictions; the violin--the plain eccentricity and enigma that is Sherlock! From the second I first laid eyes on Jeremy's Sherlock, before he even spoke--I believed it; I believed in him.

  I believed in Sherlock Holmes all over again.

  I can state with absolute certainty that no one in their right mind could regret purchasing this series. Honestly.",1391126400,,2915,5.081932773109243
1682997,5,B000060MVK,"Sherlock is big right now, thanks in part to the amazing BBC series starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. Add in the CBS series, Elementary, and the big budget films starring Robert Downey, Jr. and it's easy to see interest in the detective is quite high. Well, if you're craving more Sherlock Holmes? You would be well advised to check out this box set, which features, arguably, the definitive take on Conan Doyle's detective.

Produced back in the 80's, the Granada series starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes captured fan's attention back then, and it still stands true today. Now granted - the pacing is VERY different from the more recent Sherlock adaptions, but they are also more true to the actual stories, being set in 19th century London with rapt attention being given to the source material; the stories are treated like actual mysteries and not action films.

Just about everything about this series is flawless. The care put into each episode is flawless and production values are high. The acting performances by Brett as Holmes and David Burke as Watson are a treat to watch and mesmerizing.

Some of the episodes contained in this 13 story set are the most celebrated and well beloved of the Sherlock Holmes cannon. You get Irene Adler's story in 'A Scandal in Bohmeia' and Moriarty in 'The Final Problem' - a must see for those who loved 'The Reichenbach Fall' in BBC's Sherlock.

If you're new to Sherlock Holmes and are looking for more of the detective, this is the set you're looking for. You will be hooked and don't be surprised if Jeremy Brett takes over your opinion as being the best Holmes ever. Enjoy!",1390694400,3,1638,4.777385159010601

The casting of Jeremy Brett was brilliant; he is so perfect as Holmes- Brett's movments, voice, and looks all corespond perfectly with the original books. Watson is also exellently acted; what a nice change from Niegel Bruce's buffonish character. Edward Hardwick plays Watson as a much more intelligent person; certainly not Holmes' equal so far as brains, but definately a worthy companion.

My personal favorites are The Speckled band, The Blue Carbuncle, and The Naval Treaty, though all the episodes are great. Each story stays very close to the books, and are relatively non-violent, considering that many of the mysterys concern a murder.

I highly recommend this collection, they are far superior to any other Sherlock Holmes adaptations. You will not be disapointed.

1683103,5,B000060MVK,"This is a TV series from England in case you didn't know.  The production is fantastic.  Authentic, period correct.  Real horses, real carriages, real kids with real carts scooping real horse poop.  Everything about the show is top notch.  I was especially impressed with Jeremy Brett.  He is now my benchmark for Holmes.  When I was a kid I thought Basil Rathbone hit the mark because he looked so much like what I thought Holmes would look like.  After seeing illustrations from The Strand, the magazine in which Holmes first appeared, he looks very much like him, but I digress.  As an adult, I have had occasion to see some of the old movies starring Rathbone and was left a bit flat.  Too clinical, didn't seem human.  Also, Watson seemed like a buffoon, a hanger-on.  After seeing Peter Cushing, Rupert Everett, Christopher Plummer, Matt Frewer, Peter Cook, and Johathan Pryce, my money is still on Jeremy Brett.  I look forward to seeing Robert Downey Jr..  Another thing I liked about this series is that Watson is portrayed as a real human.  He was sometimes afraid, and sometimes mustered up courage.  He did his best to pay attention. He tried his hand at analysis.  He is clearly a protege to someone far ahead of him but he is still a man who knows things.  He was a doctor after all.  He is a real friend to Holmes, not a sycophant or a wannabe.  Holmes as portrayed by Brett, is clinical, witty, friendly, emotional, solitary.  All in just the right measure.  His impatience with situations is tempered with his mentoring of Watson when necessary.  You can tell that the two men are great friends and they rely on eachother throughout their adventures.  I can't say enough about this series.  Buy the whole series.  Watch it and enjoy it.  The clothing, the locations, the acting all are top drawer.  The productions stay true to the original stories.  This series may ruin you for any other portrayal of the stories.  It's that good!",1356566400,,1949,4.663716814159292
1683104,5,B000060MVK,"All of the Holmes episodes with Jeremy Brett are spectacular.  Brett plays the truest screen version of the famed detective with each episode sticking to Doyle's works right down to the plot twists and turns.  Brett plays the intellectual Holmes - as Doyle constructed the character - and he is far above today's ""action hero"" character actors who fake the part.  If you want the best Holmes series that promises to delight, inform and even enlighten - this is it.",1354838400,,464,4.775
1683145,5,B000060MVK,"After two cases where Holmes manages to demonstrate brilliance while still failing his clients (""A Scandal in Bohemia"" and ""The Dancing Men""), the Granada series chose to dramatize one of his most stunning successes in ""The Naval Treaty.""  Adapted by Jeremy Paul, the most prolific of the stable of writers who worked on the series, this episode shows Paul's trademark attention to the backstory and sympathy with Holmes's clients.

In addition to neatly setting out the mystery of the stolen diplomatic document and the nervous attache who lost it, the cast is bolstered by the young man's fierce fiance, her whiskery brother, and several other well-played supporting characters.  Back when Amazon still only sold episodes as individual episodes on videocassette, one reviewer noted that the client seemed too weedy, while his fiance was too stern - which I thought was a bit unfair.  The client's indisposition is offset by a touching scene in which he shows his determination to set his life and health back on track in order to be worthy of his wife-to-be, and the woman's spirit is admirable, not off-putting.

The episode is also notable for the first appearance of the theme which would later become one of the most touching and melancholy of the many beautiful musical moments composed by Patrick Gowers.  Sadly, this theme never made it to the soundtrack (my first purchase from Amazon).

All in all, a highly stylish (just watch the scene with the rose and you'll see what I mean), beautifully written, magnificently played episode - and high time to see Holmes back in control after two episodes of some kind of failure.",1351123200,,1631,4.974264705882353
1683146,5,B000060MVK,"""The Dancing Men"" is a rather odd second choice to fill the second episode slot in what was planned to be a long-running series.  While the deductions and code-breaking keep the pace moving, the fact is that Holmes fails his client rather spectacularly.  Coming on the heels of the brilliant ""A Scandal in Bohemia,"" perhaps the most famous story in which Holmes fails his client, seeing another such story was an odd move.

But the producers at Granada knew what they were doing.  This piece, full of life, humor between Holmes and Watson, brilliant visualization of the code-breaking by littering the set of Baker Street with chalkboards, scraps of paper, and Watson sneaking peeks into Holmes' monograph on secret writing, manages to show Holmes triumphant even as he acknowledges the depth of his failure.

Aside from the always magnificent performances of Holmes and Watson (Brett and Burke, who play off each other incredibly well, with a steady humor and understanding of each other that shows in little moments like the way Watson assures Holmes he will take a record of the case by holding up his little notebook), Tenniel Evans and Betsy Brantley (the latter having a much meatier part than ""the mom in Princess Bride"") are sweet and heartbreaking as the husband and wife plagued by her secret past.

With sharp, clear-cut coloration work in the country locations, and the usual clever camerawork (including clever and exciting uses of animation to show the obsession over the dancing men in dreams), ""The Dancing Men"" shows Holmes at his best and worst - and continues the promise of ""Scandal"" in forming the Holmes of a generation.",1351123200,,1642,4.952727272727273
1683147,5,B000060MVK,"I bought the DVD collection of this series several years ago, when it was first collected.  At that time, there were still videocassettes and DVD two-episode packs being sold, which allowed for individual reviews of episodes.  Now that the series is available on Instant Video, that feature is again an option!  Since I recently started rewatching the series in airdate order with a friend, I thought I'd review along with my watching.

""A Scandal In Bohemia,"" the first and perhaps the most famous of the Sherlock Holmes short stories (though the novels ""A Study in Scarlet"" and ""The Sign of Four"" preceeded it), is here brilliantly adapted, acted, and filmed as the first episode in the landmark 41-episode television series starring Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes (sadly, though Brett wanted to do all 60 films, his premature death in 1995 cut the project short).  In an introduction which cleverly sets the Holmes/Watson relationship as already established, and deals with Holmes' profession (which he created), his drug use, and his affectionate yet eccentric relationship with Watson, the Granada series starts off with a bang.

The supporting players are all quite engaging - the King is blustery, bluff, handsome, and quite stupid; the lawyer is appropriately snobbish, sharp, and yet sympathetic; Mrs. Hudson is of course fantastic (Rosalie Williams will forever be that character for me in a way even Brett couldn't eclipse other Holmeses).  But the trio of central performances is what makes the world sit up and take notice that for the first time since the 1940s, Basil Rathbone had a serious contender for the hearts and minds of Sherlockians and Holmesians everywhere.  Gayle Hunnicut as Irene Adler fills an often dubious role with incredible grace and humor; David Burke kicks off as ""the first Watson"" with dependability, bite, intelligence (a stated goal of the series was to reverse the Nigel Bruce ""bumbler Watson"" image - which had middling success in terms of public perception, though the series always presented the character as quite capable), and hilariously fixated on food (a bit of business I sometimes wonder if Burke brought to the character, as he tends to tuck into his food on screen quite vigorously, and perk up every time victuals are mentioned); and, of course, Brett, in his hollow-cheeked, baroque-voiced, tuxedo-clad brilliance as The Holmes of his generation.

The filming here is top notch - along with clever camerawork, beautiful lighting (though perhaps a bit overdone on the soft-focus whenever Adler shows up), and incredible staging of magnificent scenes, the production's attention to detail shines in small moments like having Holmes remove his own makeup.

Though not the series' best episode, it is probably in the top ten, and deservedly so.  Never before and never since (yes, that's right, this version knocks ""A Scandal in Belgravia"" out of the water) has the battle of wits between Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler been so magnificently depicted.

1683186,4,B000060MVK,"I've watched this series since I was a little girl. I've always loved it. The Mystery series written with Jeremy Brett takes these classics seriously, staying true to many of the elements of the stories (but not adhering strictly to them). What's great about them is the feel of the show, and how easy it is to love the characters. It's surprisingly emphathetic, as well. I love the episodes where great care is given to the victims'/clients'/other secondary characters' personalities and circumstances. (Without being overly-sentimental.) It also really feels like it should be the real Victorian London; it's not too exaggerated. It feels like the main character's (Holmes) home.",1338336000,,681,5.256880733944954
1683187,5,B000060MVK,"There are three stories repeatedly told in film that appeal to this reviewer; Alice in Wonderland, Wyatt Earp, and Sherlock Holmes. The arguably best telling of Alice in Wonderland is Walt Disney's 1951 and Johnny Depp's 2010 versions. For Wyatt Earp, it's hard to beat 'Tombstone' (1993), although John Ford's 'My Darling Clementine' (1946) must be noted (among the many many fine renditions of these great stories).

When it comes to Sherlock Holmes, it is generally recognized that Jeremy Brett's version of the famous detective in 'The Adventure's of Sherlock Holmes' is the reference model by which all other portrayals of Holmes must be measured. This reviewer agrees.

I would like to make the point about how great the production of this series is by referring to another series on a completely different subject. There was a good series produced by HBO in recent years on King Henry VIII; 'The Tudors'. This is another story that has been told over and over again in various productions with various actors. Good as The Tudors was, something was missing in the production that kept the series from being *great*. If you view another telling of the King Henry VIII drama,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Wives-of-Henry-VIII/dp/B003WEAW04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Wives of Henry VIII</a>, you find out what that missing element was; PERFORMANCE. In that 1972 series, Actor Keith Michell embodied Henry VIII in a way that Jonathan Rhys Meyers did not (I say that as a big Jonathan Rhys Meyers fan. View him in Shakespeare's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Titus/dp/B000E6ESKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Titus</a>&nbsp;to see him at his best).

The ""problem"" with the Six Wives of Henry VIII production were the [almost literally] cardboard sets. The Tudors beat them here. But my point is that 'The Adventure's of Sherlock Holmes' series is that it works on ALL levels. There's great story, because The episodes are based upon the Author Conan Doyle's originals  which are converted to screen plays in a smart and snappy fashion. The series is beautifully shot, magnificently re-creating turn of the century London. Sets are rare, with much of the series shot on location and in real buildings.

And finally we get to the crowning achievement, the performances, which are nothing short of brilliant. The cardboard production of `Six Wives of Henry VIII' trumped The Tudors because Keith Michell *became* Henry VIII. We always remember when an actor so fully embodies a role that we cannot imagine anyone else in the role... Telly Savalas was Kojak... Peter Falk was Columbo... Darren McGavin was The Night Stalker. And so too Jeremy Brett was Sherlock Holmes. A wiki article on Brett's work as Holmes revealed the man took on the task with a Holmesian rigor! He researched both the character as well as Conan Doyle in great detail. You can see it in every nuance of his performance. It's wonderful to watch.

Jeremy Brett is gone, but we have his work captured on disc. And now we are also fortunate to have the return of the Holmes character with Benedict Cumberbatch brilliantly taking on the role in the series ""Sherlock'... a modern day version of the character. It works. Cumberbatch is the best Sherlock Holmes since Jeremy Brett. Forget the Robert Downey Jr. distorted renditions of Conan Doyle's great detective.

Being minor Sherlock Holmes scholar, I was very impressed with the staging and the cinematography of this edition of the stories. Don't get me wrong I appreciate the work of Basil Rathbone's depiction of Holmes, but I see Jeremy Brett as the definitive Holmes.
 Set in the correct period, the Jeremy Brett Holmes is how I see the character when I read the stories. The staging of the famous rooms at 221b Baker Street hit the mark... I can not say enough about the environment that the production crew did for these stories... they are exceptional.
 Yes, I have heard a lot of complaints over the years about poor audio track and the endless debates over which actor was the worst Watson. I personally believe that these ""weaknesses"" of the production are very much a minor thing. I've seen these a number of times on DVD media, and no they are not super 3D surround sound (they were not recorded in that format), but the sound quality is much improved over the VHS-Tape editions.

1683216,5,B000060MVK,"Playing Sherlock Holmes is something to which many actors are called, but very few are chosen. In the hundred-odd years since Conan-Doyle's legendary detective appeared in print, the list of men who have portrayed the Baker Street sleuth has grown to enormous preportions. It includes such luminaries as Sir John Geilgud, Peter Cushing, Frank Langella, Tom Baker, Charleton Heston, Michael Caine, Orson Welles, Christopher Lee, and Peter O'Toole. But standing over all of these, even over the great Basil Rathbone, is Jeremy Brett. He doesn't just play Sherlock Holmes. He IS Sherlock Holmes. And that is what makes Granada TV's THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES such a delight. If you ever wondered what Holmes really looked like, how he laughed, how he smoked his pipe, how he played his violin, how he shot his cocaine...this is how you find out.

ADVENTURES (shot in 1984 and 1985) covers thirteen of Conan-Doyle's most classic tales from the early days of the Holmes - Watson collaboration, starting with ""A Scandal in Bohemia"" and winding up with ""The Final Problem."" By and large the episodes are extremely faithful to the stories upon which they are based, but John Hawkesworth, who adapted most of them, did a marvelous job of making small adjustments when necessary, sometimes weaving dialogue from unused Conan-Doyle tales to beef up his screenplays. The production design, costuming and ""creative surround"" are outstanding; from sulphurous London fogs to spongebag trousers to hooves clattering on cobblestones, you really feel as if you're in 1889. Coming back to the sorry 21st Century is kind of a disappointment afterwards.

Obviously, I can't review each individual episode here, but I will say that the series rises to dizzying heights with its takes on ""The Speckled Band"", ""The Crooked Man"", ""The Solitary Cyclist"", ""The Blue Carbuncle"", ""The Red-Headed League"" and ""The Norwood Builder."" The truth is, however, there isn't a bad episode in the lot, and the appearances of such excellent character actors as Charles Gray (Mycroft Holmes) and Colin Jeavons (Inspector Lestrade), as well as men like Jeremy Kemp and John Woodnutt and Norman Jones (of ""Dr. Who"" fame) only strengthens things.

Of course, no Holmes is complete without his Watson, and David Burke does an admirable job of filling the sidekick's shoes, playing the doctor as a loveable, long-suffering and only slightly bumbling companion. It's the chemistry between the two actors working together, however, that sells the series. Brett and Burke act like an old married couple, which lends a lot of comic relief to stories (like ""The Greek Interpreter"" and ""The Dancing Men"") which are very grim and dark indeed.

In closing, I'd like to say that although Granada produced another 23 hour-long episodes and five two-hour films, this collection is arguably the best of the lot. Sometimes series television is done right, but once in a decade or so it is done perfectly, and THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES is perfection.",1324339200,4,3005,5.151639344262295

I savor every episode b/c I know they are finite.  I plan to buy the entire set, something I have only done with one other series (Arrested Development).

Brett was so good at knowing when to nuance and when to be flamboyant. He is a joy to watch! The two actors that played Watson in the series also nailed that character and the transition between them goes almost unnoticed. Between the two ably-played main characters and the many fine character actors, the performances are so captivating that one can overlook the slight and occasional hiccups the writers created in translating the actual Conan Doyle stories into screenplays... hiccups that don't show up in all the episodes. The picture quality of this edition is much better than the previous individual boxed sets as well. For that reason, and the likelihood that you will be hooked once you watch them, my suggestion is to forsake the many individual DVD sets (of varying quality) and get the whole shebang in this one edition. This boxed set will do us for the rest of our lives. They are good enough to watch over and over, year after year.  Beware the cheap knockoffs coming out of China!",1274832000,,1125,4.793814432989691
1683261,5,B000060MVK,"Everybody knows him -- the pipe-smoking detective on Baker Street (with or without the movie-added deerstalker), who is able to deduce all sorts of things just by glancing at a person.

And while a lot of recent adaptations have completely bastardized Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's brilliant detective, ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" shows off Sherlock Holmes at his best. Not only is the writing and direction amazing, but Jeremy Brett and David Burke are simply brilliant in the main roles.

Holmes (Brett) is visited by the masked King of Bohemia, who has a slight problem: he's engaged to a princess, but his former lover Irene Adler has a compromising letter that could jeopardize his future marriage. But Adler has a formidable brain of her own. Then Holmes is hired by a man whose wife is receiving strange coded messages, filled with dancing men.

Among the other strange cases that Holmes and Watson undertake -- a stolen treaty, a music teacher being stalked by a cyclist, a locked-room murder, a dead woman whose last words were ""it was the band, the speckled band!"", a blue jewel hidden in a Christmas turkey,  a young woman given a surreally weird job, a man kidnapped to serve as a Greek interpreter, a man who inexplicably left all his money to someone he didn't know, a paranoid doctor and disappearing patients, the ""red headed league,"" and a clash with Professor Moriarty over the Mona Lisa.

Sherlock Holmes mysteries come in two types:
1. The case is completely baffling, and Holmes is needed to unravel the knot of obscure clues.
2. The case seems straightforward, but Holmes is needed to connect seemingly unrelated clues to the crime in order to find the REAL perpetrator.

There are plenty of both kinds in ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"" with over a dozen cases that require Holmes' unique detecting skills -- it can be something as simple as locating a letter, or something as complex as foiling a robbery, uncovering a hidden person or counterfeiting ring.

The writers do an excellent job faithfully translating Doyle's stories into the visual form, and there are some wonderfully creepy moments (such as the Greek translator being forced to translate for a silent, bandaged man). And the dialogue is remarkably smooth (and sometimes funny), sticking to the old-timey flavor of Doyle's prose (""Your conversation really is most entertaining. If you would close the door, on your way out, as there is a decided draft"").

Brett is considered to be one of the two best Holmeses in movie history, and he's nothing short of brilliant -- he plays Holmes as a brilliant, manic individual whose mind focuses to a knife point when confronted by a problem. And despite Holmes being arrogant and blunt, Brett infuses him with a kind of bouncy warmth. At the same time, David Burke is one of the best Watsons: he plays the sidekick as being not a genius but is definitely intelligent, warm-hearted and capable.

""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" is a magnificent adaptation of Doyle's legendary mysteries, filled with murder, intrigue and all sorts of weird crimes. As for Brett, he's perfect.",1274486400,3,3115,4.929389312977099

But this performance by Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, with his companion Dr. Watson (played by David Burke)...

Fabulous.

Jeremy Brett portrays Sherlock Holmes as an imperfect person.  Holmes has a drug problem, and borderline misogynic attitudes.  His intensity, however, reminds me of a trained dog, commanded to sit and stay, just itching to be released to chase a squirrel... the dog is trembling with excitement and anticipation.  Holmes does the same as cases and clues come together in a crescendo of mystery-solving rapture.

Dr. Watson is a true friend, who benefits from their relationship by being allowed to chronicle Holmes' adventures.  And Holmes, using the powers of observation, experimentation, and logic, bores into his cases with tenacity, and sometimes at considerable personal risk.

I find myself envisioning Sherlock Holmes as a ""Jeremy Brett"" rather than a ""Robert Downey, Jr.""  That says something about Brett's performance!

Jeremy Brett is so good you will not be able to think Holmes without seeing his face.  Typical of the best British TV, every single minor character is portrayed by a top notch actor.  This series is as good as the original stories, maybe better.  I love the Homes stories because Conan Doyle did not feel the need to create absurd plot twists to spice things up.  Once the crime is solved the reader can understand the crime - elementary! The only problem with the DVDs is that the sound quality of the music in the opening credits is rough.",1265932800,2,642,4.406779661016949

1683297,5,B000060MVK,"Perhaps I'm slightly biased in my belief that the first two seasons are the absolute crowning jewel of the Granada series, being that I vastly prefer David Burke's portrayal of Dr. John H. Watson as opposed to that of his successor, Edward Hardwicke. Burke did a marvelous job of giving us an intelligent, capable, witty, ""blithe"" Watson who was very much the epitome of unquestioning loyalty. He was utterly convincing as a retired army surgeon, competent partner and above all, friend. Other intelligent Watsons have come across as put out or openly hostile, as was never the case with the Canon equivalent, though this is one trap Burke never falls into. I have heard him referred to as the ""dumbed down"" of the two Granada Watsons, yet being that nearly the entirety of his dialogue was ripped from Watson's own lines (and a few that were originally Holmes') I've never understood that opinion.

It's also possible that (in my opinion)the immensely talented Jeremy Brett's portrayal of the great detective was at his peak during the first two seasons, not to mention the natural chemistry between the two leads. Brett was an uncommonly perceptive actor, and while he gave Holmes a somewhat darker turn, his nuance of character, genuine flair for dramatics and the art of subtlety, bring Holmes to life as no other mere mortal ever had. He is Sherlock Holmes, and it is readily apparent Brett was born to play this role.

Or, it could also be that the adherence to the Sherlock Holmes Canon was so masterfully achieved it's clear what a labour of love this production was for the producers. More likely, the combination of all these elements is what sets this apart from not only 99% of other adaptations, but even from the later episodes of the same series. For me, it was like flipping through the pages of the books, watching the stories come to life not only with the faithfulness, but the striking attention to Victorian detail.

Just as the collection of Holmes stories by the same name are amongst some of the best found in Canon, the ""Adventures"" are by far some of the finest Granada had to offer. While there were numerous worthwhile episodes following ""The Final Problem"", the magic, for me, had been lost with the next season.",1257811200,3,2241,4.785529715762274

1683299,5,B000060MVK,"You don't have to be a great mystery enthusiast, nor a lover of crime drama, nor have anything except a sense of adventure and an enjoyment of great acting to love this Sherlock Holmes series. It is not often anymore in today's world that a character seen on television or in the movies can serve as a role model for young minds, but with his emphasis on brains winning where brawn fails, Holmes shows that study and observation and careful deduction can score a much higher reward than bullying and bravado. And Holmes does face his share of bullies and brutes who would like to stop him. With contempt for those who threaten him and courage in the face of vicious thugs who stalk the night, Holmes pursues answers to horrific crimes by taking avenues that others would not dare to follow. From the intimate corners of lavish estates and palaces to the grimiest back alley hell holes he tracks down those who believe they have gotten away with the perfect crime. Always impeccably groomed and handsomely attired, the limber and elegant figure of the man is no slouch when it comes to the unpleasant task of having to dispense with a brute in direct confrontation. Well schooled in self defense, boxing, fencing, and physically energetic, thugs who think they can simply run roughshod over Holmes are suprised to find themselves flat on their backs after trying to assault him. But this is not the way he prefers to resolve matters, nor does he often need to resort to using a revolver, he does not normally carry one, though he shows he will readily do so if the pursuit requires it.
 The supreme confidence he has in his own resourcefulness coupled with obvious delight he takes in putting sadistic and sinister villains behind bars makes Holmes a figure who defies any sort of commonplace spotlight in the pantheon of the great heroic figures of literature. The acting is brilliant. Though typically his face is the model of placid contemplation, as situations change you see the subtle moods change in his facial features clearly indicating his anger, contempt, concern, shock or mirth but never too much. Jeremy Brett plays the role with humor and graceful, fluid understated changes in his moods. Maintaining control of his emotions most of the time, Holmes clearly has very little patience when it comes to those who do not come to the point and present the facts. He also has little patience for idle time. His mind is busy and loves a challenge, he often laments of there being no suitable challenge to occupy his time. Though he has a standard fee for his services as a private detective, he will often dismiss his fee if he finds a cause sufficient to pursue despite a client's lack of funds. There is not a single drama in the set that should be missed. The video is crisp and brilliant to watch, the audio is fine and the music fits the mood of the series. The period set pieces are also amazing to behold in themselves, a great recreation of a time out of history.  Well worth the investment.

1683300,5,B000060MVK,"Other reviews have remarked on the choice of stories, on how well Jeremy Brett portrays Holmes, on the faithfulness to the Conan Doyle stories, etc.  I cannot add much more to their praises.  Instead, it might be useful to write a review for the non-Holmes fan, someone with only a passing interest, or one who hasn't read the stories.  As I have only read the stories once, and then several years ago, I think I'm in a good position to comment in this way.

Be assured that no pre-knowledge is required to enjoy this set.  The Holmes stories are simple - only two main characters (and only a few recurring peripheral characters - e.g. Holmes's landlady and brother).  Although some of the stories may be a little absurd, they are all well-acted and engrossing.  Most welcome is the feel of the Victorian England in which Holmes and Watson live: Watson is the proud Englishman, having served his country in its colonial wars, and making no apologies for it.  Holmes is somewhat more introspective - he can see the injustices of the Industrial Revolution and the futility of war, but he is still deeply English and cannot fathom that a person from any other country could be as useful as he.  One might argue that the casual opium use (by Holmes) is overstated, but it is certainly part of the manic-depressive character of Holmes.

What is most striking about the shows, however, is Brett's performance.  The quirks and mannerisms he creates makes Holmes a living, 3-D character.  Just his performance is so engaging that you lose yourself in the story even though an hour-long show may have been adapted from a mere 3- or 4-page story.  It's never dull, even when the plot moves slowly, which is a credit to the screenwriters as well.  All-in-all a very enjoyable series.",1244505600,2,1772,4.711038961038961

In this collection, David Burke does a sympathetic portrayal of Holmes' collaborator Dr. Watson (replaced in later productions by Edward Hardwicke).

The production values for these one hour episodes are exceptional for television, featuring lots of period-appropriate on-location shooting in London and around England, superb period costumes and music, and a faithful recreation of period customs.  The story selections actually come from the Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes and the Return of Sherlock Holmes as well as the Adventures.  Among the highlights: the classic closed room murder mystery in ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band"", the puzzling code of ""The Adventure of the Dancing Men"", and the mournful outcome of ""The Final Problem.""

Jeremy Brett is aloof, energetic and intense as Holmes; his sheer velocity seems to carry along the patient and more personable Dr. Watson in his wake.

The characterizations of Holmes and Watson are spot-on perfect, and more believable than the Rathbone-Bruce version.  Believe all the favorable remarks made in other reviews.

One overlooked good spot is the original music written by Patrick Gowers.  The theme introducing each episode is played by a violin, the instrument Holmes plays, with light accompaniment.  This does a good job of suggesting the general subject matter.  Over the course of each episode the theme is subject to variations, reinstrumentations, and counterpoints (sometimes with other themes), all in keeping with the needs of the episode.  Who knew the theme could stretch so far?  One could package it up as a successful, gigantic exercise in theme and variation in classical music.

One unmentioned bad thing about the DVD production is the inaccuracy of the subtitles.  For example in The Red-Headed League, Mr. Jabez Wilson turns into Mr. Jay Beard Wilson.  In The Final Problem, ""well-contrived"" turns into ""welcome tried"", ""mews"" turns into ""muse"", the Mona Lisa is in the ""Louve"", ""monsieur"" turns into ""messier"", and a hotelier in Switzerland wishing a ""Gute Reise"" is said to be ""Speaking Dutch"".

1683407,5,B000060MVK,"I recently purchased both ""Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" and ""Return of Sherlock Holmes"" and I am having a marvelous time!

I do admit the DVD transfer doesn't look awesome (especially on my big-screen TV...probably looks way better on a smaller one). The first disc is especially flawed in both audio and video quality, but I think that's only because they crammed four episodes on that disc whearas the other discs include mainly 2 episodes. All the other episodes look a little better.

Anyway, what more can be said about Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes? The actor really took a major risk in ""going for it"" with his interpretation of the famous sleuth. It's one of those rare cases where the perfect actor met with his perfect role...magic!

But I'd like to make special mention to David Burke's Dr. John Watson. As many others have mentioned Burke's Watson is no bumbler...no buffoon. He's a smarter than average (if not quite as smart as Holmes) companion who we the audience identifies with immediately. He does provide laughs, but not in a demeaning way. His reactions to Holme's many eccentricities are priceless. At times, he even manages to steal scenes from the great Jeremy Brett. Also, Watson had a military background and David Burke conveys that more than any actor I've seen play the part. On a side note, Edward Hardwicke is a fine actor and did an admirable job replacing David Burke and carrying on the character in dignified fashion. However, I do find myself missing Burke's reactions and his overall presence in the Hardwicke episodes. Hardwicke does a great job as the observer we identify with, but he never quite added the personality that Burke gave Watson.

All in all, I'm so glad I've bought these box sets. I can't really bring myself to watch the episodes from ""Memoirs"" and ""Casebook of Sherlock Holmes"" because of Brett's illness. But I have also bought the features of ""Sign of Four"" and ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".

1683446,5,B000060MVK,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 56 short stories and 4 novels of Sherlock Holmes rank amongst the greatest sellers in the literary world. Surpassed only by the Bible, and William Shakespeare. Extraordinary company to say the least. There have been many characters throughout the history of cinema who have graced their presence in the form of Sherlock Holmes. Many mediocre, and others average to a bit above average. However, none of these actors have ever captured the essence and quality of Sherlock Holmes envisioned by Doyle as did actor Jeremy Brett.

Jeremy Brett was without a doubt the greatest actor to ever portray Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes--bar none! The nuances and inflections of his acting breathed life into the character of Holmes, and I do not believe that there will ever be another Sherlock Holmes that I will ever enjoy watching. Brett broke the mold. I grew up with the old black and white reruns of actors Basil Rathbone [Sherlock Holmes] and Nigel Bruce [Dr. Watson] episodes. And having read the books as a young boy, one of the things that always struck me odd was the time period that Doyle's Sherlock Holmes took place in: The 1940s.

And while I can understand that the war effort in World War II required rousing the citizens with the protrayal of Holmes taking on the Nazi's who were a real threat to England at the time; the fact that these episodes of Jeremy Brett take place in Victorian England, make this series all the better. Moreover, no one has ever been able to capture the character of Holmes as well as Jeremy Brett. There are 13 episodes included in this DVD Boxed Set Collection. Among some of the 13 episodes are ""The Resident Patient"" ""The Red-Headed League ""The Crooked Man"" and ""The Final Problem.""

I highly recommend this entire series of the consumate, and definitive Sherlock Holmes to ever grace the screen. For those who have never seen Brett's performance as Sherlock Holmes, and have only seen the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce films, all I can say is that while I understand that many of these films were for propaganda purposes due to the second world war; the fact that these newer epsisodes [until the death of Jeremy Brett in 1995] are all set in contemporary Victorian England, make the series all the better: A much closer interpretation of the Sherlock Holmes envisioned by Doyle. I highly recommend this most wonderful series to all. There are not enough stars to give to this series. [Stars: 5+]",1156118400,8,2471,4.795774647887324

1683448,5,B000060MVK,"Jeremy Brett remains, and probably will remain for a while, the best on-screen Sherlock Holmes, and David Burke was an excellent Dr. Watson. This collection of DVDs contains what you might call a Baker's Street dozen episodes (that means a total of 13) encompassing the range of Sherlockian adventures. Included are several of the most famous Sherlock Holmes stories, including ""The Red-Headed League"", ""The Speckled Band"", ""A Scandal in Bohemia"", and ""The Final Problem"". The last, of course, started the famous ""Great Hiatus"" where Conan Doyle had reputedly tired of writing the Holmes stories, and killed the great detective off in order to effectively end the series. It didn't work of course (hopefully I'm not giving anything away here) and the great detective returned later.

I really enjoyed this series, with a few provisos. Some of the Conan Doyle stories aren't up to the standard of the stories above. They're still fun, however, in that Brett and Burke are just wonderful playing Holmes and Watson, and the supporting cast is for the most part excellent also. The period is lovingly recreated, though occasionally you can see things in the background down the street from the Baker Street house that don't look exactly like downtown London a hundred years ago. I guess they were on a soundstage outside London in the country somewhere. The soundtrack occasionally warbles where it should sing (the music being the usual problem).

1683467,3,B000060MVK,"I experienced the same problem that Thomas R. Dufresne did.  Over a year ago I rented volume 1 of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.  Loved it so much that I decided to buy the boxed set.  Well, after three consecutive times of trying to buy it from an online retailer I gave up because they kept sending me a set that contained a defective Disc 1 that would not play on either my laptop or my DVD player.  Each time I returned it, they would send me a replacement boxed set that contained yet another defective Disc 1.  I finally gave up and requested my money back, which they did give me.  Even when I tried to buy just Disc 1 by itself, they sent me a defective Disc 1.  Can you imagine my frustration?  So I tried ordering it from Amazon.  Again the same problem with a defective Disc 1 in the boxed set.  But Amazon is excellent with customer service, and they refunded my money when they received the set that I returned.

Since then I have tried to rent Disc 1 from my rental source, but three times they have sent me discs that I cannot play:  1 that was cracked and 2 that would not play in the same manner that the defective ones I tried to purchase would not play.

An email message from me to MPI reporting this defect was ignored.

Gee, it's almost as if I was jinxed and doomed to never be able to view Disc 1 ever again.

I'll give it a 3 star rating because the other discs in this set play just fine, but it would be great if all the discs were playable.",1134086400,18,1472,4.11578947368421
1683468,5,B000060MVK,"Despite the title of this review, I remain a firm fan of Basil Rathbone's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, and always resisted the idea that anyone else could fill that role with equal aplomb.  Well, Jeremy Brett has proven me wrong.  While still undeniably the Holmes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and not some revisionist abomination, Brett brings a slightly modernized take to the role, adding subtleties and nuances that I thoroughly enjoy even as I remain loyal to the memory of Basil Rathbone.

Brett's Holmes is slightly more eccentric than the Holmes of Basil Rathbone, a bit more histrionic, a bit quirkier, a bit more arrogant, yet also a bit more sensitive.  He is a flashier dresser, almost a fop, and at times his mannerisms border on the effeminate.  But any hint of effeminacy is quickly dissolved as Holmes springs into action, barking commands with his thoroughly masculine voice, and insisting that people get right to the point.  Brett's Holmes is thoroughly no-nonsense when the prey is afoot.  And although I have characterized Brett as an edgier Holmes, the edginess never becomes ""camp"" or overstated.

Then there is David Burke, who gives us a much more substantial  Dr. Watson than the amiable buffoon portrayed by Nigel Bruce.  Not only does Burke prove a worthy companion for Holmes, he also - unlike Bruce - seems to possess sufficient intellect to actually have passed his medical exams.

As for the stories themselves, they stick very close to Arthur Conan Doyle's originals, and that is how it should be.  They are wonderful stories, and need no tinkering.

I have only minor quibbles about the production.  Dialogue occasionally gets lost or is indistinct, and in some cases the street scenes - in my opinion - have the feel of a set, rather than an actual street - nothing glaringly obvious, just a slight sense of unauthenticity.  Perhaps this is because I am used to a black-and-white Holmes and a black-and-white London, and the bright colors are an entirely new element in my vision of Holmes and his world.

Do not buy this DVD for the extras - they are relatively meager:  biographical information about the stars, addresses of Holmes fan clubs and societies, and some still photos from the earliest editions of the Holmes stories.  That's about it.  But if you are an old crank like I was, unwilling to admit that anyone can equal the Holmes of Basil Rathbone, you might be pleasantly surprised with this set.",1131580800,,2443,4.857487922705314

1683502,4,B000060MVK,"There's nothing more to be said about the production itself -- high class all the way, and Brett is Holmes, closer than any other actor has been able to touch. (Nicol Williamson did a very credible job in The Seven Per-Cent Solution. It could have been great if Grenada had hired him to finish the S.H. series after Brett's untimely death. I don't know if this was ever considered, but I think about the possibility wistfully.)

As a public service, particularly in view of the increasing popularity of high definition television sets and home theater, people need to be aware of the half-baked job of DVD mastering  this series got. Most of the time, it is better than VHS, but that's not saying much.

The most charitable thing I can say is that the picture quality is acceptable, most of the time. But it is still grainy in a way that reflects poor conversion to DVD, not the grain of the original film itself. The last three episodes are crammed onto one single layer disc, with degradation that would be evident to anyone with a 13"" TV set. Even the color suffers -- especially on The Resident Patient, everything has a horrible greenish tan cast. The focus is fuzzy, not sharp. The sound is intermittently warbly and muffled in spots too. I have seen VHS versions of some of these episodes, and they would be preferrable to the worst of this  lot.

To add insult to injury, The Return of Sherlock Holmes set is even worse in some ways than this set! ""Inconceivable!"" as Wallace Shawn would say in The Princess Bride.

I suspect that the region 2 DVDs of this series available in England are much better, but I have not seen them. You'd need an all region DVD player to play them in USA.

Most people will watch these and be happy in spite of the substandard video, simply because the stories and acting are great. But what is the point of having these programs on DVD if they are not DVD quality? If a VHS set of Adventures of S.H. can be obtained for reasonable money, I that is a sensible option until this series is remastered properly.",1119916800,9,2045,4.495956873315364

1683505,5,B000060MVK,"I've been reading the Sherlock Holmes stories since I was a wee lad of 11. The very first story I ever read was `The Greek Interpreter', then `The Speckled Band'. But I didn't really become an admirer until my late teens, when I bought a volume containing Sidney Paget's incomparable and stunning illustrations of the Master Detective.

I was never entirely satisfied with past portrayals with Sherlock Holmes or Dr. Watson. They were either invariably portrayed as overly arrogant (Peter Cushing as Holmes), or as buffoons (Nigel Bruce as Watson). It wasn't until I discovered the work of Jeremy Brett (via an Amazon.com search), that I finally found THE DEFINITIVE portrayal of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson  - one that will probably never be surpassed in my lifetime. I was absolutely stunned at every aspect of each and every episode. Their attention to detail - everything from Production Design to the performance of every single actor, is a pitch perfect rendition of Sherlock Holmes adventures, straight from the pages of the Strand Magazine. And Jeremy Brett's very countenance is the exact mirror image of Sidney Paget's drawings - from his distinctive nose to his eloquent and articulate mannerisms.

Every single episode in this collection is an absolute classic. Interestingly enough, although they contain two recurring characters, each story has a different tone and atmosphere. `A Scandal in Bohemia' has a delightfully romantic and baroque feel, while `The Speckled Band' has all the tensions and scares of a horror story. But the crowning glory of each and every episode is Jeremy Brett's performance as Sherlock Holmes, and David Burke's rendition of Watson. Burke brings a positive aggression and proactive stance to Watson, that has never been seen in any rendition of the character before or since (with the exception of the always excellent Edward Hardwicke). And Jeremy Brett's portrayal of Holmes is pitch perfect in every single way imaginable - from the tiniest inflection, to the timbre of his voice.

The only gripe I have is not with the actual episodes, but the way they were presented on DVD. MPI did a straight video transfer, without any attempt at cleaning up the prints or agumenting the sound. As a result, we have a slightly grainy transfer which would make any DVD purist die of apoplexy, and a flat sounding mono soundtrack, which fails to convey the drama of either the music or sound effects. I have heard reports that the last two collections in the series (Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, Case Book of Sherlock Holmes), have received better treatment. Here's hoping.

Other than that - these volumes are the greatest renditions of Sherlock Holmes ever committed to celluloid. Forget Rathebone - Jeremy Brett is THE Sherlock Holmes, and David Burke (and Edward Hardwicke) will always be his Watson.",1101600000,20,2838,5.0685224839400425

Of course, movies are never quite as good as books. ""Watson's"" unique style is lost a bit as the films can not convey his thoughts the way he can in the books.

My biggest complaint is the sound track. Unfortunately, the quality here is very poor with huge flactuations in volume level. You either need to turn the volume up very high to hear everything, or you will find yourself constantly adjusting the volume.

1683508,5,B000060MVK,"How wonderful to know that all the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes episodes are finally coming out on DVD! He was never less than perfect, even when suffering from extremely poor health. Only complaints about this DVD series is that the subtitles are a joke - I sometimes turn them on, as occasionally the English accents are a bit odd or they use words I do not recognize, but only as a last resort because very often they are just plain ridiculously wrong. As an example, Watson says something like ""so that's not our man?"" and the subtitle reads ""so he can't cause us harm?"" Also, the sound in general is not great on these in a few spots. One question - when will they release Brett's incredible performance (I believe it was on Masterpiece Theater) as Maxim de Winter in Rebecca? It is the best filmed version of Rebecca and a must for Brett fans!",1091577600,12,849,4.483870967741935
1683509,5,B000060MVK,"These are the first 13 episodes in the justly-famous Jeremy Brett series.  To my mind, they're the best of the lot.  ""The Red-Headed League"" and ""The Blue Carbuncle"" are Doyle at his very best.  Jeremy Brett seems about the right age, a fit 40ish (though the actor was probably more like 50ish at the time).  Brett's Holmes feels exactly right, complete with memorable mannerisms and Victorian grand gestures.  It's hard to imagine a future actor ever trying his hands at it.  David Burke is a better Watson than Cedric Hardwicke, who replaced him in the later episodes.
Watson is a tough guy to figure out.  What kind of man would devote all his free time to following and assisting Sherlock Holmes?  It doesn't help that Watson is under-developed in Doyle's stories, a sort of literary device that allows Holmes to verbalize his thoughts in ways comprehensible to us mere mortals, of which Watson is one.  There's frequently a condescending tone in Holmes' remarks to Watson, though Holmes is clearly fond of Watson and actually relies on his help.  Nigel Bruce made much too much of this condescension in the Rathbone films, in which he played Watson as a buffoon for comic relief.  In the 1970s, someone named Rosenberg wrote a book, ""Naked is the Best Disguise"", in which he looked for signs of latent homosexuality in the Holmes-Watson relationship.  I don't think we want to go there, do we?  I think that the best way to flesh Watson out in a dramatization is to play him as, among other things, an adventure junkie.  He loves the excitement, mental stimulation, and danger.  Cedric Hardwicke's pudgy, middle-aged do-gooder doesn't work for me.  David Burke's Watson is also a man of decency, a do-gooder (as is Doyle's Watson) who wants to see justice done, but he also seems rugged, physically fit, believeable as a man who saw combat in India and who now thrives on the adventure that his association with Holmes allows him to experience back home in London.",1089244800,6,1969,4.798219584569733
1683510,5,B000060MVK,"I grew up watching this wonderful series. I honestly think that Jeremy was the perfect choice for Holmes. Unlike a lot of Sherlock Holmes I have seen. The one thing that I dearly love about Brett's performance. Is that he brings a sort of sweet touch of humanity to Holmes. That most actors do not.
I love every moment with Brett as the most famous fictional detective in the world. There is allows a sweet sense of humor that Brett gives Hlomes that a lot of actors do not do.
 Most actors build around to Holme's intelligent and busy body side.
There is just something wonderful and real that Jeremy Brett brings to the long list of players as Sherlock Holmes.
If you want to get any set of movies on Holmes then please get this one, and if you plain on doing even more watching on Sherlock Holmes. Then I suggest the next great version is with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.",1082073600,,878,4.386503067484663

Jeremy Brett does a magnificent job portraying the detective even down to his addiction to the 5% cocaine.  David Burke is an excellent Watson as he tries to use Holmes' methods but draws the wrong conclusions.  The stories follow very closely to those written by the author although there were times when they had to extend the story to fill up the episode's time.  The villians were, shall I say, villianous.  I cannot have a favorite episode as they are all above the highest rating I can give.  It shows us the phrase, ""Elementary, my dear Holmes.""  It was Watson who actually said that phrase.  The acting is so powerful that I almost wept as I watched The Final Problem.  If you want to see the character Holmes come to life before your eyes then I suggest that you watch these DVDs.  They are the best and Jeremy Brett is THE Sherlock Holmes.  God Bless them all.",1079395200,,1043,4.380208333333333

Jeremy Brett masters the difficult character of Sherlock Holmes perfectly.  He might have sprung whole from ""The Strand.""  The arrogance, the brilliance, the sharpness and even the appearance, every aspect of Holmes is alive in Jeremy Brett.  Of equal effect is David Burke as Watson.  Although not quite ""as brown as a nut,"" he is still a rugged, useful Boswell for Holmes.
The selected stories for this first series are all winners as well, with ""the damn woman"" in ""Scandal in Bohemia"" and the outstanding ""The Blue Carbuncle.""  Not every story is adapted faithfully, as is shown with the inclusion of Moriarty in ""The Red-Headed League,"" but there is respect and quality.  Every episode is great.
The detail of the stories is amazing as well, taking more from the books than the familiar film-adaptations.  Gone is the Calabash pipe and the superhero costume of Deerstalker cap and matching cloak.  Instead, Holmes smokes the straight wooden pipe of the stories, and changes his outfits accordingly.

1683536,4,B000060MVK,"This is probably a must-have for those like myself who consider Jeremy Brett as having given us the definitive Sherlock Holmes. He's moody, given to odd fits and starts, rude to his clients -- in other words, he's the eccentric genius Doyle had always intended him to be. No calabash pipe here: Holmes always smokes straight wooden or briar pipes. (Attentive viewers will notice a visual joke. Laying on the mantlepiece near Holmes' pipe collection is a meerschaum-lined calabash. He never smokes it.)
This first series featured David Burke as Watson, who brought a fresh perspective to this character. No longer the bumbling idiot of Nigel Bruce, he's an intelligent man, talented in his field, and an able medical practitioner. He's out of his depth next to Holmes when it comes to criminal detection, but one gets the feeling that if you place him next to Lestrade he wouldn't look so dense. Edward Hardwick did a good job in the later series, but we have Burke to thank for redefining the role.
These episodes are not always taken verbatim from the stories, but in many ways they managed to improve on the originals. I won't give any spoilers, except to say that episodes such as ""The Greek Interpreter"" and ""The Norwood Builder"" are rather more dramatic and sinister to watch than they are to read. The plots are simplified by making Watson a single man and Holmes' roommate, where in some of Doyle's stories Watson was married and lived elsewhere. Not all the episodes are of equally high quality, but all of the are a good deal better than the next best thing, and Brett and Burke always turn in splendid performances.
I wish the DVDs had been better done. They're obviously of spotty quality. The ""warble"" reported by Sean Brady below was noticable in a couple of places for me in the first two discs, although I thankfully have not yet experienced the blocking. I really wish the first disc wasn't double-sided, as I find double-sided DVDs difficult to handle. The print from which the transfer was made had deteriorated noticably. If this was the best one available, that's tragic. Had the overall viewing experience been better, this would have rated 5 stars.",1060214400,6,2170,4.804812834224599

I am in complete awe of Jeremy Brett's talent as an actor and his complete commitment to a flawless rendition of what Sherlock Holmes would be like as a person, mannerisms, attitudes, quirks and all. This is one of the few series that is able to recreate the feeling and intensity of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's written masterpiece.
Technically, I am very glad I delayed purchasing this series until it was released on DVD. I now have the very best of sound quality reproduction to enjoy the wonderful and sometimes eerie ambience of this extremely well put together series by Granada.
THIS IS A MUST HAVE AND IS DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY CENT.

1683538,4,B000060MVK,"Rather than discuss the stories that make up this DVD set, I'm going to focus on the quality of the DVD themselves as others have already expressed their views on this excellent series in previous reviews.
The set itself is presented really well. All 5 discs are contained in a custom keep case with an attractively designed cover. The menus are attractive and user friendly. The only notable special features are some of the excellent Paget illustrations as seen in the original publication of the stories. It's interesting to look at these after you have seen the corresponding story to see how the production crew were obviously inspired by these drawings.

The first disc in the set is double-sided and contains the first four stories. There are some minor problems with sound especially in The Naval Treaty where the audio takes on a 'warbling' effect in the last act, distorting the sound. This is particularly noticeable during the end credits during the theme music. Thankfully this problem does not surface again on the other discs. If it does, it is certainly not as noticeable as in this story.
The video quality across the set varies. Do not expect a remastered version of these stories. At best, they are VHS quality, but if you just want to focus on the stories themselves rather than how they look onscreen, you shouldn't find the varying quality too distracting. Examples of variance in picture quality can be seen in The Copper Beeches which features a slightly washed out picture, and The Crooked Man which features a strange video artifact which results in elements within the picture ""wobbling"". For example, a vase or lamp in the foreground appears to move about while the background stays still. This is not a fault of the source material and can be attributed to the DVD authoring process. It is somewhat distracting but it doesn't detract from enjoying the story itself.
It is unfortunate that MPI chose to compress the last three episodes onto disc 5 as The Final Problem, perhaps the best episode of the series, suffers from excessive grain and slight macro blocking in the picture. What do I mean by ""macro blocking""? When you look at a CD-ROM game, movie, etc on your PC you may notice that the backgrounds tend to look blocky, with small shifting ""squares"" within the texture of the picture. This is the same thing I noticed in The Final Problem, most noticeably in the scenes during the finale when you can see this effect in the background scenery. Did it stop me being able to enjoy this story? Nope. However, this could have been avoided by properly managing the compression problems on the disc, putting the episode on the other side, or using a dual layer.
If you are a fan of the Granada Sherlock Holmes series and aren't too fussy about quality, then you'll be very happy with this set. I've watched it often and never tire of the stories as they are all extremely well written, directed and acted, and the sets, lighting and music are excellent.",1056931200,15,2983,4.758687258687258

1683574,5,B000060MVK,"Sherlockians everywhere:  Jeremy Brett is the Master.  If you haven't seen these episodes, or any of the others featuring the late Mr. Brett, you're missing a treat. I was a great fan of Basil Rathbone until I stumbled upon the Brett/Burke duo some dozen years ago.  Now I can't imagine anyone else bringing Sherlock Holmes to life.
This collection features thirteen great episodes actually based on what Conan Doyle wrote.  This is Holmes in all his moody eccenticity, from the mouse coloured dressing gown to the seven percent solution.  This is also a Watson I was relieved to see, not the bumbling idiot that Nigel Bruce made him, but a solid reliable citizen with his own sort of intelligence:  the perfect foil for a Holmes who pointedly ignores social convention. (Edward Hardwicke took up the role of Watson after this season, but I really prefer David Burke's portrayal.)  The translation from page to screen is not exact -- e.g., bits of conversation from ""The Sign of Four"" appear in ""Scandal in Bohemia"" -- but there's nothing that came out of the blue.
AS far as a DVD collection goes, this is an odd one.  The special features are nothing to write home about and the 13 episodes are formatted weirdly onto five discs where 3 or 4 certainly would have done.  In some of the early episodes the sound is quite distorted, as if the DVDs were copied from well worn video tapes without the copy being cleaned up in any way.  But all of that made no difference to me, because I'm so pleased to have these episodes and be able to watch them any time I want.

1683577,5,B000060MVK,"As there are already plenty of other reviews here detailing the specific episodes, let me just toss in my opinion along with the others that Jeremy Brett played the most authentic Sherlock I can imagine. His body, his voice, his mannerisms, his very BEING was true to the portrait of Holmes that Doyle wrote of. Even now, when I go to read the stories of Sherlock and Watson, Brett is easily pictured as Holmes--all the way down to his graceful fingers and small brief smiles. It was a tragedy to lose Brett, but we can be thankful that he was able to bring these classic mysteries to life before leaving us.
Holmes wasn't the only character that was played so perfectly, the role of John Watson is also played quite well by David Burke throughout the ""Adventures"" section of the Holmes series. In the later sections (""Return"", ""Casebook"", ""Memoirs"" and all the longer stand-alone movie-episodes) Edward Hardwicke took over as Watson. I am not sure why Hardwicke took over, but I must say of the two I do prefer Hardwicke's Watson over Burke's. In any case, for this ""Adventures"" DVD set, it is Burke's Watson that you will see, and he does do an admirable job that in no way detracts from the spirit of Watson.
In one other area this entire series excells--the care taken with each and every episode. The people behind this series must have truly loved Doyle's Holmes. Every scene is done perfectly, from the idea of the locations to the photography to the scenery. The ""mood"" is set, and with Brett and Burke prowling the city and countryside, the stories of Sherlock Holmes come to life here like never before (and because of Brett's death, never again). If you love Holmes, you MUST see these!
Addendum: I contacted MPI video (the releasers of the Granada TV's Holmes series on DVD) and the person who responded to my e-mail said that they WILL continue to release the next series of Holmes DVDs ""next year"".

1683578,5,B000060MVK,"Personally, I can't take seriously the old Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies -- although Rathbone was a competent Holmes -- because Nigel Bruce played Dr. Watson as a buffoon. In the books, Watson was an educated, intelligent man and a staunch friend and companion to Holmes. The fact that Holmes' intellect thoroughly surpassed the intelligent, educated Watson served to indicate Holmes' genius. In my opinion, it is essential for Watson to be portrayed correctly for a Sherlock Holmes adventure to be correctly done. In this set of adventures David Burke played Watson to perfection -- the best portrayal of Watson ever done, in my opinion -- and thereby enhanced Jeremy Brett's reputation as an outstanding Holmes. This is a truly outstanding collection of the adventures of Holmes and Watson in all regards.",1035676800,13,815,5.181818181818182
1683579,5,B000060MVK,"Since Hollywood first began filming Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, each generation probably has their favorite actors playing Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  However, there is no better Holmes than Jeremy Brett and this set proves it.  The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and its successor The Return of Sherlock Holmes may be the finest versions of Doyle's stories ever put on film coupled with the finest Holmes ever.
This set of stories shows Brett at his finest, before an illness began to slowly take away his strength.  Brett looks like the Holmes I've always imagined - tall, intense, driven by his passion.
Don't sell David Burke short as Dr. Watson, either.  Of the two Watsons in this series, Burke always seemed more authentic than Edward Hardwicke in the later series.  He didn't create a weak character but he was definitely a bit more likeable than Hardwicke's interpretation (Hardwicke is good too and actually seems to fit better in later episodes).  That comes in part because Burke's version allows the viewer to better identify with Watson, in effect allowing Watson to take the place of the viewer.
The sets are true to the stories and Brett's mannerisms as Holmes allow him to become the character perfectly.
This set is terrific with some of the best Holmes stories.  I have only two problems with this set:  the breaks between scenes are abrupt(probably where commercials were inserted?) and it ends with The Final Problem without giving us the glory of Holmes resurrected.  Hopefully, the next set will come out on DVD soon to rectify that problem.
Personal favorites in this set:  The Red Headed League, The Blue Carbuncle, and the Naval Treaty.  Not to mislead - the other stories are done well, too and create a great atmosphere.  A Scandal in Bohemia has many excellent aspects - Holmes' various disguises and the apparent ""defeat"" of the great detective by ""the woman.""

Typically, Holmes and Watson surface as an insufferable egomaniac partnered improbably with a bumbling fool.  Here, we see a flawed, brilliant man who is nonetheless capable of inspiring great loyalty and affection in a very capable assistant and friend.
These particular stories are also quite good when compared to the later stories with Edward Hardwicke as Watson.  There seemed to be a very relaxed coziness between Hardwicke and Brett that probably made for more enjoyable shoots, but bled the relationship between the two men dry of any energy.  Brett and his Watson in these stories, David Burke, seemed to be different enough to give some spark to the on-screen friendship, with Brett using more stylized and stage-y acting and Burke a more modern-seeming technique.

So who makes a better Holmes - Jeremy Brett or Basil Rathbone? Rathbone was very good but Brett has fleshed out the character to a fascinating degree. Brett's Holmes is arrogant, manic, conceited, contemptuous of others, morose, having just a whiff of something unnatural and unwholesome about him. All of this is supported by the original stories by Doyle. Brett is a far better actor than Rathbone, which is especially obvious when Holmes is in disguise. Brett is clearly loving every minute of his portrayal and his exhilaration is infectious. I enjoy Rathbone's Holmes a good deal.

1683608,5,B000060MVK,"The main reason, in my opinion, why Brett's interpretation of the Holmes character has made such an enormous impression is that he was completely serious in his work. He did not just take directions from the original stories, trying to imitate the character described there, but developed a rationale for Sherlock Holmes's behaviour. This may not be the exact same rationale that Conan Doyle had when writing the Holmes stories, but it doesn't matter. Brett's behaviour is consistent with the Holmes we love from the stories, but with full depth of character. As an example, he knew exactly why Irene Adler held such a unique position among women for Holmes. The reason is rather mundane but perfectly believable, and therefore good. You can read about it in Bending the Willow. Brett's Holmes is his own, but it has depth as no other filmed Holmes ever had. That's why we love him.
A more objective quality of the series is that it reinstated a long mistreated Watson. Conan Doyle's Watson is vigorous, brave, popular with women, and of at least average intelligence--not a bumbling fool that Holmes brings along for comic relief. When he boldly rummages through London's opium dens in search of lost patients, he's no coward. He catches on to Holmes's deductive techniques from time to time, and anticipates his explanations. According to Conan Doyle, he was, or at least had been, a habitual womanizer. Nigel Bruce? I don't think so. David Burke? Oh yes.
Finally, the series is a superb period achievement, from the street scenes to  costumes to the music. If you like these kinds of escapisms--and who doesn't--you can't go wrong with Granada's Sherlock Holmes.",1029456000,7,1665,4.967741935483871

Since then I have accomplished little else. Jeremy Brett was Sherlock Holmes and this set offers a wonderful look at his adventures and times. I came back to Amazon today to see if the rest of the series was available. Strongly recommended to all Bakerstreet Irregulars!! The game's afoot!",1029369600,7,447,4.6
1683610,5,B000060MVK,"Jeremy Brett is the one an only Sherlock Holmes...exactly as Doyle wrote him.  He is the Perfect Thinking Machine but he is truly human with his human flaws.  Brett is the only one who shows this just as it is written.  I'm a devoted fan of Doyle and have read, multiple times, every Holmes story.  I also recommend John Dickson Carr's biography of Doyle...one of the greatest biographies I've ever read.",1029283200,3,404,4.647887323943662
1683631,5,B000060MVK,"The one thing this collection shows is that Basil would have been untouchable even today if he had been allowed to act in the stories as written.
Brett just never ""gets it""
All the hubbub when the BBC did these new shows, but Jeremy Brett was never suited to the role.....the excitement was really based on seeing these tremendous stories as written by Doyle.....Brett smirks when he should be showing a knowing glance, and shows contempt for feelings that was not consistant with the logic associated with the detective's reactions in the stories, reactions that were delivered so masterly by Mr. Rathbone.
I guess my point is this: I buy these DVD's because I love the stories, and the fact that Basil Rathbone never had the chance to act in them is the real shame...",1028246400,,769,4.703703703703703

ONLY I CAN SAY IS THAT I AM VERY IMPATIENT TO BUY THE OTHERS CHAPTERS IN DVD (THE SECOND STAIN, DEVIL'S FOOT, ILUSTRIOUS CLIENT, PRIORY SCHOOL,.....). MY QUESTION IS WHEN WILL REALEASE THE REST OF THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES IN DVD?

1683633,5,B000060MVK,"I was prepared for disappointment when I watched this, since I'd liked them so much the first time. But Jeremy Brett & the two Watsons are as delightful as on first viewing. It is really hard to believe that Mr. Brett has passed & will not be making any more of these. For me, he was the archetypical Holmes & brought his own very special flair to this series. My only disappointment with this is that the collection doesn't include _all_ of the episodes made, but that just means I have more to look forward to, when I buy the remainder. I found the series to be very true to Doyle's writing, very good with plot points & lines, and just wonderful characterizations throughout.",1027728000,2,678,4.475806451612903
1683634,5,B000060MVK,a great thank to mpi! this dvds have better quality than the japanese and they are much cheaper! lets hope that the full length films and the other episodes will come soon!!!!!!,1026172800,2,177,4.5625
1683635,5,B000060MVK,"Jeremy Brett was The Sherlock Holmes. For those of us who love the cerebral and quirky detective of 223B Baker Street, this series was absolutely delicious. Sadly, Brett died in 1995 and there are no more of these to be made.
This DVD has the first 13 episodes, some of the finest stories extracted from the entire Holmes volumes. They are:
A Scandal in Bohemia
The Dancing Men,
The Naval Treaty
The Solitary Cyclist
The Crooked Man
The Speckled Band
The Blue Carbuncle
The Copper Beeches,
The Greek Interpreter
The Norwood Builder
The Resident Patient
The Red Headed League
The Final Problem
As is usual with DVD's you get extras, like info on Holmsian societies and photos.
Brett was SO right as Holmes. Even his little movements, that quick turn were right out of Doyle's descriptions. The scenes have that murky, foggy English air, the sets are exquisite. I am captivated every time I watch these and I don't think any set of written stories has been better translated to the small screen. In fact, stories I didn't particularly like are better in this series, such as The Solitary Cyclist, which I never did appreciate in print.  The first 13 epsisodes are the best of the best Holmes tales, at least, they have most of my favorites.",1025740800,201,1238,4.7050691244239635
1683636,5,B000060MVK,"If you are looking for high quality entertainment that remained faithful to the original stories, this box set is for you. The initial release of the first volume had some very annoying problems with sound quality. On speaking with one of the representatives from MPI, this was supposed to be fixed. Well, they have to an extent. There are only two stories with noticible sound problems in the first volume and they are far less severe than they were from the initial release. The other volumes have no problems at all.
I only hope they release the other movies with Jeremy Brett soon.",1024876800,9,585,4.689320388349515
1683637,5,B000060MVK,"I have to admit: when I first saw the series I wasn't really thrilled. Of course, I only saw the German version which was dubbed in the former G.D.R. This version was censored quite heavily. For instance every reference to Holmes' drug abuse was cut out, which happens to be an important aspect of Holmes' personality. Being used to the film versions with Basil Rathbone and Peter Cushing I also thought that Jeremy Brett was quite overacting. Today I am ashamed of that.
I challenge you: read the original stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - you will never find a better and finer Holmes on film than the one performed by Jeremy Brett. And let's not forget Watson. Finally there is a real Doctor and not a mere comic relief. David Burke and in later seasons Edward Hardwicke are a pure joy to watch. Furthermore in every episode you have a great cast. Some of the biggest talents British TV has to offer.
The producers went to a great deal of trouble to make the series as ""right"" as possible. Although Baker Street 221b didn't exist in Holmes' time the production designers recreated a room of the exact proportions that would have fit in a house of that time and area. Every detail was thoroughly investigated, like the colour and shape of the drapes or the carpet. Another important reference were the original book illustrations by artist Sidney Paget. His pictures literally come to live. Nothing is missing, not even the Persian slipper where Holmes keeps his tobacco.
This boxed set (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes) is the complete first season. Just watch out for the next titles of the series. Let's hope we don't have to wait too long for them.",1024185600,15,1658,4.662116040955631

1683639,5,B000060MVK,"Granada Television series is the best production of Sherlock Holmes adventures. The faithfulness, the authentic locations, ambience,dialogues, researched background scenery are marvelously captured in this collection. Some of the scenes are very clearly inspired by the original sketches by Sidney Paget.  Jeremy Brett has taken over the mental image of Holmes in my mind. He was born to play Holmes. The first installment of 13 episodes on this DVD set is a MUST HAVE for any fan of the Master. Bare minimum extras on DVD or slightly impaired sound quality as criticized by other reviewers should not discourage anyone. The sheer pleasure of listening to the hypnotic violin theme as the titles of the Granada episode appear is worth the money. EMI, hurry up ! and give us the rest of the DVD sets.",1023840000,29,799,4.962686567164179
