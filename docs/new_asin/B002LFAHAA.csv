8372856,4,B002LFAHAA,"Briefly, this movie, in Mandarin Chinese but with English subtitles available, made in Mainland China, centers around a dentist who has a young child, perhaps age 6-7, no mother but the father has a former love interest who is a television announcer for a game show who decides to enter the child in the game show.  The object is to get the child to go home, hence the name, ""Home Run,"" on his own, but with a bit of prompting, as needed to keep him safe, from many of the game show staff which are to remain unseen by the cameras filming the child live on nationwide television.  The ratings of the show have been sagging lately and the host (the former love interest of the child's father, the dentist) is about to lose her job therefore, but when the dentist's child performs many unexpected moves on live television interest in the live show skyrockets and viewers all over the city and country are riveted to the live action wondering what the child will do next.  The father (dentist) is unaware his child is starring on live television, making the action all the more unpredictable and thus riveting the viewers to their sets all the more.  That's the story line, which makes for riveting viewing for us as well.  I found the humor a bit quirky, in a very novel and thus enjoyable way.  Particularly the ending scene has a twist that's very quirky as well, but involves poetic justice that can only make one wince as well as laugh at its novelty.  All in all I enjoyed the movie tremendously, almost meriting a five star review, but to do my part to avoid ""grade inflation"" I'm giving it four stars.  For those wishing to learn the Mandarin Chinese language it's an extra bonus and is worth five stars, as its dialog is not too rushed or mumbled and basically I learned a lot of new Chinese words and remembered Chinese words I had previously learned by watching it.",1399680000,,1873,4.504424778761062
