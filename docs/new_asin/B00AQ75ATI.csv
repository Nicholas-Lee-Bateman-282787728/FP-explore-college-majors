5469402,3,B00AQ75ATI,"Love the series but in this set, the music is off.  Something isn't quite right with it.  The sellers were fine.  Got the DVD in a timely fashion, etc.  It's just that this was such a wonderful show.  To not be able to hear the music, that matched the witty dialogue, is so disappointing.",1412553600,6,288,4.2592592592592595

5469407,5,B00AQ75ATI,I purchased WKRP in Cincinnati because I remembered watching this show in the 80s when I was about 8 years old. And I saw it again while I was watching Hulu Plus and I was reminded of that funny storyline and cast and how hilarious they were! So almost immediately I logged onto Amazon to see if it was available and there it was! So excited when I received it in the mail. They don't make good sketch comedy like this anymore.,1371168000,5,427,4.219512195121951

8556196,4,B00AQ75ATI,"I'm glad to have this in my collection again, it's even funnier than I remember. Only thing I don't understand is why they cut over 2-1/2 minutes out of episode 4, Hoodlum Rock. It's been a long-time favorite episode of mine which I've seen often on YouTube. Most of the cuts involve Johnny Fever's subplot about the Cincinnati Triangle; why would they cut that? There's also a chunk cut out of Mr. Carlson's discussion with Andy regarding his reluctance to have WKRP host the concert, including a few lines by Bailey Quarters and Herb Tarlek. Strange.",1446508800,,552,4.760416666666667

8556199,1,B00AQ75ATI,"This abomination was all we had for 6 years.  To call this by the same name is an insult to the artists, musicians, writers, directors, and everybody else who contributed to this wonderful series.  All the music is generic garbage.  The show used (despite CBS's objections at the time) REAL music consistent with the radio station format.

AVOID THIS SET!!  A few months ago, Shout! Factory released the complete series.  They spent 2 years and (I'm told) nearly a million dollars clearing music.  They didn't get everything, but they got almost everything.  Yes, the complete collection is expensive, at more than $100, but we all knew that would happen if anyone ever tried to release the ""real"" thing.  If the price is too steep, Shout! Factory is also releasing the seasons one at a time.  Buy the first one and see what the show was supposed to be.  Compare it with this disaster.  The music was as much part of the script as any of the human characters.",1424390400,4,959,4.642857142857143
