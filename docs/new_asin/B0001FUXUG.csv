1996869,5,B0001FUXUG,"I'll keep this short and simple.  Having been in Recovery for more than 13 years, watching this brought tears to my eyes.  Yes, this could be any one of those with the disease of addiction's fate....ashes spread around a tree in a shopping cart pushed by a homeless drunk.....this is a must see for any friends of Bill W. that don't quite remember what is was like, and still could be!",1283731200,5,385,4.408450704225352
1996875,5,B0001FUXUG,My friend found this here and was so thrilled that he did. I ordered it right away and as soon as he received it he sat down and watched it. He was so glad to be able to own it now.,1388188800,2,181,3.4390243902439024
1996876,5,B0001FUXUG,"This is a 1980 movie independently produced, and personally financed by Ralph Waite (""Cool Hand Luke,"" ""Five Easy Pieces,"" ""The Waltons."")  I searched for it for ages and am thrilled that it is now out on DVD.  No bells and whistles, no elaborate packaging, just a GREAT movie from a unique time in the American movie industry.  Way to go, Mr. Waite!!  Thank you!  (And thank you, Amazon!)",1369180800,2,389,4.661764705882353
1996877,1,B0001FUXUG,"We were really looking forward to the arrival of this DVD!

The jewel case for the DVD was of a very cheap, thin material and since it arrived broken at the hinge, it will not stay closed. There was just a copy of the original DVD's cover, inside the cheap jewel case. The DVD itself was cracked from the middle to the outer edge, so it is unplayable. The DVD was just an unmarked copy like I could make myself.
This is NOT the quality what we thought that we would receive for our $22.93!! A very disappointing purchase.",1365465600,3,521,4.262626262626263

1996880,3,B0001FUXUG,"While I love having a copy of this great movie, I am disappointed with the shabby packaging. A blank CD jewel case. No graphics. No info. Feels like a bootleg.",1342137600,,159,4.333333333333333
1996881,5,B0001FUXUG,First saw this film back in the 1980's and have rented it several times but I have not seen it in several years. I really identify with this story. I have never forgotten it.

1996883,5,B0001FUXUG,This is an awesome little independent film.  -- One of Roger Ebert's favorites.  I first saw it in 2008.  I hear it's now out on DVD.,1302825600,2,133,4.038461538461538
1996884,5,B0001FUXUG,"It is an earnest and affected work of evident love, a tale told with such compassion that it is not so much angry as sad. Ralph Waite elects to see a certain ruined dignity and a generosity and qualities of kindness that may indeed deepen the feelings of tragedy. A brave and highly watchable film suffused with a tenderness that puts into even sharper relief, somehow, the gritty reality and the hard shadows of ""the Nickel."" Lyrically romantic in its al-fresco-with-graffiti way... ""On the Nickel"" is a testiment to the possibility of ultimate triumph.

8011988,5,B0001FUXUG,"I have looked for a clean copy of this movie for years!  I have purchased numerous DVDs & one VHS tape from other sellers & they were all obviously copies of copies.  I decided to try one more time & this one was PERFECT that came in the mail MUCH quicker than I expected!  I was so happy with this product & seller, I went back & bought the last one available before I posted this.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I would hope the seller would let me know if more become available.",1504742400,,485,4.063157894736842
8011989,5,B0001FUXUG,This is a wonderful movie with lots of heart. I remember it from the first time I saw it in the early 80s.,1503705600,,106,3.652173913043478

8011991,5,B0001FUXUG,"Love this movie. Especially found of Donald Moffat's performance and his character's journey from frustration, loneliness and fear to a simple gladness that he is still alive and in the company of friends.",1493942400,,205,5.242424242424242
8011992,5,B0001FUXUG,"Offbeat story of down and out street people and their tragic lives. Written, produced, directed and starring Ralph Waite (better known as the father in The Waltons)",1421366400,2,164,5.111111111111111
8011993,5,B0001FUXUG,The film really portrait the lifestyle of the winos and hobos beautifully realistically in a simple way. Ralph Waite is such a great actor and I'll like to see more of his work. The main reason why I had to watch this film is because of the soundtrack by Tom Waits titled On the Nickel. I'm a huge fan of Tom Waits and he talks about this movie in some live performances of the song.,1400544000,2,383,4.12
8011994,5,B0001FUXUG,"I first saw the movie on TV and I loved it and was shocked by it at the same time. I then found it on VHS but that format has gone by the way. I searched for years to see if it was ever put on DVD. Finally it has been! The DVD version is  absolutely astoundingly good. One of my all-time favourite movies and the pride of my DVD collection. Ralph Waite, I thank you for your belief and perserverance in bringing your dream to fruition! And to me the movie exudes his passion for this project. Anyone who is fortunate enough  to obtain a copy of this movie has a real treasure.",1395360000,3,576,4.043859649122807

8011996,5,B0001FUXUG,"Thank goodness for not needing ""fancy duds"" to present a story so absolutely powerful ... Thomas J. Wise - I am grateful for the ""renewal"" project you and Ralph Waite took on to make this available. Becoming aware of it, having the opportunity to purchase and watch this (and re-watch many times in the future) is a gift to myself.

8011997,5,B0001FUXUG,"I first saw this movie years ago when it was out in limited release. I was working on The Bowery in NYC at the time which was New York's version of LA's Nickel. Felt that although the movie depicted life in a highly sanitized manner, the story of loyalties and friendships and struggles was very real. I purchased a tape shortly thereafter and many years of my patients watched and discussed it. Finally, the tape died and I retired. This is the first opportunity I have had to find the DVD and I will treasure it! Found the copy to be of very high quality. Thank you for having it available!",1390953600,3,592,4.342342342342342
