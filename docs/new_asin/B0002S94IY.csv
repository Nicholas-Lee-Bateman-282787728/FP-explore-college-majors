2117320,4,B0002S94IY,"Do you think that Hugh Jackman is one of the sexiest men on the planet?  Then you'll want to see this!  Jackman plays a young detective trying to solve a grizzly slaughter at a roadside diner.  His partner is an older woman, leery of relationships.  They have a hot night together, and they solve the crime.  I think this went on to become a TV series in Australia, so the relationship doesn't progress more in the movie. Jackman was good in his role.  He reminded me some what of his character in ""Someone to Love"".<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Someone-Like-You/dp/B00005N5VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Someone Like You</a>",1186531200,9,664,5.59
2117321,5,B0002S94IY,My wife and I love this Australian series.  This is the only movie in the series of 22 episodes which made it onto a region 1 dvd.,1180137600,,130,3.814814814814815
2117322,2,B0002S94IY,"I live in BRAZIL and confess that I bought this movie because of HUGH JACKMAN...however the movie surprised me...I liked very much of the tram, and Rebecca Gibney is an excellent actress too !  I recommend for everyone who like to see Hugh Jackman acting...He's very handsome in this production !!!",1170720000,2,298,4.8431372549019605
2117323,4,B0002S94IY,"Hugh Jackman fans this is for you!  It's a pre-X-Men work of Hugh's, an episode of an Australian TV show that he was in.  While the name of the episode is technically wrong and the story is an okay mystery, there is one scene in the film that is worth the purchase price:  A very hot love scene! Not to be missed if you're a fan.  Besides that, it is interesting as a fan to see Hugh's early work and especially his Australian work when he uses his real voice (I love that Aussie accent!).  Give it a try.",1168300800,20,505,4.0606060606060606
2117324,4,B0002S94IY,"In all honesty, I purchased this DVD because it was one of Hugh Jackman's earlier works back in Australia. I was very pleased with my purchase though, when I began to watch it and realized that it also contained a wonderful cast of actors. The story was gripping, and the ending was completely unexpected. A wonderful police story.",1109808000,23,331,4.724137931034483
2117325,5,B0002S94IY,It was a great movie and i just wish that hugh ended up with the girl at the end. I thought is was good and i would like to see more of him in movies.,1098316800,7,150,3.3142857142857145
2117326,5,B0002S94IY,I would recommend anyone who likes rebecca gibney she is an excellent character and its in her early days very enjoyable and loved it,1380672000,,133,4.583333333333333
2117327,1,B0002S94IY,"Now how stupid is this. We are in Australia, that is fairly obvious. We ordered above DVD, that's right. We did not order it to be played in the USA but right here at home.
None of our devices ie. 2 computers, 2 TVs, 3 DVD players could play it.
It said something about the country code is incorrect.  ??
We asked our granddaughter, she thought she could get it to play, but no, she could not.
Now we have a DVD we cannot play unless we move to the USA.
Do you think this is likely. I DO NOT.
Therefore the whole experience was a disaster.
I tried to return it, but it came back to me.
As the postage to return it to the sender was nearly as much as we paid I thought, forget about this and wrote it all over the DVD that it can't be played.
We are very angry, but will get eventually over it, I suppose.
Next time we will make a note that the DVD we order (if we ever do that again) needs to be playable in Australia. So it was not a pleasant experience at all.  Not thanking you. Ursula Gehler",1376179200,,995,3.945273631840796
2117328,1,B0002S94IY,"Maybe I didn't like it because it was an older movie and I felt the acting and storyline seemed phoney.  I like Hugh Jackman, but this just didn't interest me.  I never finished watching it either.",1368230400,,197,4.444444444444445
2117329,4,B0002S94IY,Isn't one of my favorite Hugh movies but it's ok. I'd watch anything Hugh is in - good or bad!!!,1367539200,,96,3.85
2117330,5,B0002S94IY,This was very enjoyable.  The actors and actress in it were all very good and the story had a few twists.,1361577600,,105,4.0
2117331,3,B0002S94IY,"Haven't viewed it as yet. But for a Hugh Jackman fan, I'm sure it will go over big - my wife likes it already!",1356912000,,110,3.625
2117332,1,B0002S94IY,This is badly acted by Hugh Jackman and the sex scene is awful and stupid and the whole plot makes no sense and there is so much blood and gore and stupid dialogue you just want to turn it off! Dont waste your money!,1344384000,,216,3.9318181818181817
2117333,1,B0002S94IY,"Waste of time and money. Hugh Jackman is good in it, but he's not in enough scenes to make this stinker of a film work.  It's so bad, it's laughable at times.",1246233600,,158,3.9375
2117334,4,B0002S94IY,"The film we see here entitled ""Profile of a Serial Killer"" is actually the twelfth installement (named ""Afraid of the Dark"") of an Australian series ""Hallifax f.p."", which dealt with professional exploits of a forensic psychiatrist, Jane Halifax (Rebecca Gibney). There were a total of twenty one episodes that originally aired on Australian TV between 1994 and 2002. Many of the guest stars are now well known names in the US, such as Guy Pearce or Hugh Jackman. The temptation to profit from Jackman's popularity must have been only too great, hence the re-named, re-packaged product. Even so, his strictly supporting role does not warrant the top billing on the DVD cover. Still, the actor gets enough screen time to make this DVD a good buy for any fan. Here, Jackman is a young police detective who briefly becomes involved with Halifax, while they both work to solve a mass murder. Interestingly, if you believe the IMDb info, Rebecca Gibney is only four years older then Jackman. However, just before they ingage in an intimate moment, her character tells him she is ""old enough to be his mother""... Hmmm...

I must admit, the decision to purchase the DVD had been strictly influenced by my being a fan of Hugh Jackman's. It was interesting to hear his Australian accent in full bloom and to observe his still raw, yet already charismatic acting style, two full years before the actor's breakthrough role as Wolverine in X-men. I was pleasantly surprised though at the overall quality of the production. The episode did well as a stand alone piece and ignited my couriosity about the rest of the series. It reminded me of such great UK shows as ""Inspector Morse"", or ""Frost"", only made on a smaller budget (the visibly budget approach was the reason for four, rather then five, stars), the only annoying factor being somewhat naive, by today's standards, treatment of forensic psychiatry as a crime solving tool. Oh, and the music...it's more psycho, then psychiatry...It even manages to turn the love scene into something frightening...

It is a great shame that the series is not available in its entirety in Region 1. I will be purchasing it directly from an Australian vendor, though having done so on previous occasions, I know how lengthy the shipping time can be. It had taken me seven weeks to receive a copy of ""Corelli"", another series with Hugh Jackman unavailable statesite but for its pilot episode (re-named ""The Rat Tamer"" and starring Jackman's then future wife, Deborah Lee Furness).",1244419200,7,2507,4.910377358490566
2117335,5,B0002S94IY,"What is it about producing Region 1 copies of Australian series?! All the episodes of Halifax should be made available. I know there are enough Americans who've seen episodes that want their own copies. The same for ""Frontline"" - named ""Breaking News"" when it played here on PBS, for obvious reasons. These are two shows, at opposite ends of the drama/comedy spectrum, that deserve Region 1 editions! I even tracked down a producer of ""Frontline,"" and he couldn't understand it either! There are more Australian programs of high quality, like ""Halifax, F.P."" languishing there. Some enlightened company needs to break them out for American audiences!",1238457600,,650,5.2

8031236,3,B0002S94IY,"I only bought this move for Hugh Jackman (my favorite actor and I currently have a collection of all his movies.) He was good in this, but the quality definitely isn't the best. I've seen better quality in the made for TV hallmark movies. It was worth watching once I suppose, but I probably won't ever watch it again.",1453680000,,318,4.406779661016949
8031237,5,B0002S94IY,Back in the early nineties I had the premium channel Cinemax. During that time they showed many Australian movies. The Jane Halifax series was among them. These were very well put together and entertaining. I was lucky to find this one at a Friends Of The Library book sale.,1429833600,,274,4.612244897959184

There's not much of a plot and the acting is very amateurish.  I'd recommend you save your money.",1402272000,,274,4.44
8031242,5,B0002S94IY,"I'm a big Hugh Jackman fan, and I heard about this movie from other fans.  I enjoyed it (it's not an Oscar contender), but it is a good mystery.  I also bought it to see Hugh portray someone else besides Wolverine.  Don't get me wrong!  I LOVE X-Men and always will, but it was nice to see him do something else.  There is also an EPIC love scene between Hugh and Rebecca Gibney! A 5 star rating in my book.  ;)",1384732800,,411,4.012345679012346
