4066280,1,B00344EAJG,"To say this is a horrible movie would be too kind. No plot. Bad female lead ""acting"". Waste of Tony Todd and Bill Moseley. Pathetic editing. Worthless photography. ""Production"" value is nowhere. ""Special Effects?"" I love how the girl hacks Bill too death yet not a drop of blood gets on her. I love how these girls are in the Arizona heat and nowhere during the film do they perspire or even look like they were sweating.! There is a book on Amazon called, ""Your Screenplay sucks!"", Brian Pulido really needs to read it. And having that many ""extras"". Seriously? You want us all to see how much worthless ""talent"" it took to make this piece of garbage? Brian went to ""film "" school. He should've taken a writing or art class so he at least could've found out before that he can't write, direct or produce anything of value for movie watchers. The ONLY thing I can say this heap of a ""movie"" has any value for is that any professors in film schools should let their students see this as what ""NOT"" too do ,as far as film making goes. A student should be warned prior to viewing but also encouraged to see this is how you, ""write"", ""produce"", ""direct"", Edit"" a truly, truly Worthless film. Brian Pulido needs to get a different career. Immediately!",1270512000,8,1246,4.493392070484582
4066281,1,B00344EAJG,"...and it wasn't even a good unfocused mess. I love horror movies, and I'm not terribly picky, but this really didn't have anything going for it. It wasn't well written, and the acting was sub-par. The worst part, though, was that it couldn't figure out what kind of movie it wanted to be. Let the record show, it is possible to be way too ambitious. They could've gone the crazy murderous rednecks route, but decided to throw in a crazy religious cult angle, and just for good measure, a smelly demon. It tried to be funny in places and fell flat every time, the suspenseful scenes weren't, and I was waiting for it to be over from about an hour in. Not even Tony Todd could save this one.",1269648000,5,690,4.3565891472868215
4066282,1,B00344EAJG,"Alright, so I knew when I started watching this year's ""8 Films To Die For"" that I'd eventually run into the typical backwater hillbilly redneck horror - and THE GRAVES fits the bill.  The threadbare story gets off to an unbelievable start in the form of two insanely gorgeous sisters who are comic book fans . . . reread that sentence again - yes, as I said, highly unbelievable.  At any rate, the sisters decide to go ""find adventure"" in the Arizona desert, which leads them to explore a ghost town - it doesn't take long before the requisite hulking figure with a hammer shows up to dispatch 'em.  Start 60 minute chase sequence, throwing in more and more ""townfolk that might help them escape, but of course turn out to be part of the same nutty cult bent on sacrificing the girls to the local demon.""

Oops - did I give too much away?  Don't worry, I did you a favor.  Despite the fairly competent work by the main actors (including Tony Todd, who has fallen a long way since CANDYMAN), the films sheer lack of originality, coupled with a non-sensical plot, place this film well outside the watchable category.  There isn't even a decent cheap jump scare to be had.  All we get is a lot of running, a lot of digital blood (ATTENTION AMATURE FILMMAKERS: AFTER EFFECTS BLOOD DOES NOT LOOK REAL!!!!! STOP IT ALREADY!!), plenty of cleavage shots from the lead actress, and various other trappings of the genre.

ZOMBIES OF MASS DESTRUCTION and THE FINAL were looking like contenders for the worst of Afterdark 4 - but now that I've seen this one, there's NO contest!  Avoid!!",1269561600,4,1576,4.556737588652482
4066283,1,B00344EAJG,"I was looking forward to The Graves.  Well sort of, maybe about as much as one can really look forward to the After Dark Horrorfest lineup, now in its fourth year, and once again offering up a slew of films that are either good, decent, or just plain bad.  Sadly, The Graves falls into the category of being just plain bad, even though on paper it should have something going for it at the very least.  Written, produced, and directed by Lady Death creator Brian Pulido, The Graves refers to the Graves sisters Megan (Clare Grant) and Abby (Jillian Murray) who while on a road trip wind up in the ghost town of Skull City, where some demonic things are occuring thanks to a devilish reverend (Tony Todd).  There really isn't much else worth mentioning storywise, mainly due to the fact that there isn't much of a story to begin with.  Everything is so cliche, the acting is tepid at best, the effects and CGI blood-letting are horribly fake looking, and the direction is ridiculously sloppy.  While Grant and Murray are gorgeous sights to behold for sure, horror stalwarts Todd and Bill Moseley even appear as if they're sleepwalking through the film.  What could have been a good bit of fun just feels more unfinished than anything else, and with that in mind, do yourself a favor and give The Graves a pass.",1269475200,3,1309,4.592274678111588
4066284,2,B00344EAJG,"Totally preposterous movie with a couple of hilarious scenes.  Tony Todd shimmys and shakes in an over the top performance as the fanatical reverend--a Jamie Foxx/Cuba Gooding impersonation..a real hoot.  Equally hilarious is the scene where the bound sisters hiss and claw at each other after smelling the demon!  This movie is actually in two parts..the first a slasher set in a deserted silver mine; the other set in the town of Unity, kind of a CHILDREN OF THE CORN parody.
The Horrorfest series is usually a lot better!",1269475200,6,524,4.865168539325842

When I saw that Tony Todd and Bill Mosely were in it I thought it could have potential, but than I remembered that besides Texas Chainsaw and Rob Zombie's movies, Bill Mosely has been in nothing but the cheesiest of cheese, and he has outdone himself with ""The Graves"", which is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie is so bad that after going my entre Amazon lifetime without having written a review, it has forced my hand... I felt it was my duty to let the people know of this abomination in movie making. If you have any self respect, you will stay far away from this movie.",1269302400,5,673,4.265625

4066288,3,B00344EAJG,"The Graves isn't a blockbuster horror film, but it's definitely better than most straight-to-DVD movies.  For this being only his second film, Brian Pulido pulls off a decent directing job.  The film's editing is good, there's plenty of hard rock, and I was really pleased with the opening and closing title visuals.  The movie was shot at real-deal Vulture City Ghost Town, so the setting is excellent.

The cast is certainly more experienced than that of your typical horror flick.  There are plenty of veteran actors, though I honestly thought Tony Todd (Candyman) was miscast as the town's sacrifice-happy preacher.  While most low-budget horror movies tend to feature a beautiful lead with no acting exerience, that's not the case with The Graves.  The incredibly sexy Clare Grant gives a solid performance as Megan Graves, the gorgeous but tough sister to Abby (Jillian Murray).

Hardcore horror fans might be a little let down by the special effects, though.  Rather than fake blood and gore, you're treated to a lot of CGI effects.  The film starts more like a slasher flick, but evolves into something along the lines of Children of the Corn.  The film isn't very suspenseful, although one aspect will keep you intrigued from the beginning.  I was a little disappointed with some of the plot holes, I thought the story could have been better overall.

I thought the blatant plug for his comic books and website by director Brian Pulido early in the film was totally shameless and absolutely unecessary.  While this movie isn't on the same level as Army of Darkness or Hellraiser, it's much better than your average straight-to-video horror movies with bad production quality and inexperienced actors.  It's worth a rental, see if you like it enough to add it to your collection.",1266883200,7,1787,4.96969696969697

4066334,1,B00344EAJG,"Overall, I enjoy the After Dark films even though yes they lack a certain quality in plot, writing, and acting. Usually, at the end I can feel I didn't completely waste 90 minutes. Well, this is not the case with this film. It was just awful. The only thing I really liked about it was the credits at the beginning and end. The premise had some potential but it tired to fit too much in yet nothing made sense. Out of all the After Dark films this one is not worth the time.",1379548800,,474,4.10752688172043
4066335,4,B00344EAJG,Honestly this movie isn't as bad as others have made it seem. It's more of an homage covered in parody. It's actually pretty funny and entertaining if you don't try to take it seriously. The cameo of the singer of Lamb of God was pretty funny and the over the top acting from the Candyman was great. It's not that bad of a movie.,1361664000,,329,4.15625
4066336,2,B00344EAJG,"(In the generous spirit of the Halloween season, this is more like 2.5 stars.) I don't know why, but I can sometimes be a real sucker for dumb movies and when I read the reviews for this one, I knew it would fit the bill and so I had no expectations whatsoever and it's probably for that reason that I actually enjoyed this more than I thought I would. It's still silly, of course, and any laughs seem mostly unintentional, especially toward the end. It's also fraught with the typical horror clichs, like the weird family and the casually strolling killer who somehow catches up to the victim, even though they've been running. Some things are never fully explained, either, like, um, the basic premise (history of the mine, the origin of the stinky demon force, why the main family is tasked with killing for it), but if you know going in you have to chuck sense out the window, as is the case with a lot of horror movies, you might be able to appreciate at least parts of it. Except for a couple of people toward the end, I didn't think the acting was as bad as some other reviewers do, either, and I enjoyed the performances of Bill Moseley and an over-the-top Tony Todd. The title sequence is also well done. ***SPOILER ALERT***: I think this would have been a far better movie if it had focused on the dynamic between who I thought was the most interesting character, Jonah, a man driven to kill but who gets no enjoyment out of it, and his brother, who takes great pleasure in it. Unfortunately, Jonah is killed too soon, and there is no interaction between the brothers.",1351123200,,1578,4.463667820069205
4066337,1,B00344EAJG,I've seen this movie before & I didn't like it. I should've paid better attention to the synopsis or they should be written with a little more detail.

People Actually on here, convinced me not to rent it, by their reviews.

4066359,1,B00344EAJG,"THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE! Brian Pulido might be the worst, most ego driven director I've ran across. Horrible in EVERY WAY. This movie is unwatchable!!!",1304294400,,150,5.04
4066360,1,B00344EAJG,"The Graves is one of those movies that decided it's already a success before it was written, produced, or filmed.  It has the air of shameless promotion about it, like when the Graves sisters (gorgeous Clare Grant as Megan and cute younger sister Abby played by Jillian Murray) fawn over comic books and then lean over the counter in low-cut shirts.  Nobody's looking at the comic books for long.

If you're wondering what the heck is going on - and it will take you awhile if you're not a fan of Brian Pulido - this is the author's first film.  He's actually the creator of such comic books as Evil Ernie and Lady Death. Which explains the cleavage, but little else.

Hotter sister Megan is moving on to a big career in New York City and the girls are out for one last fling before they are separated by distance and success.  So after lounging around comic book shops in tight clothes, they visit a tourist trap at the abandoned Skull City Mine.  There's nothing believable about these two: not their relationship, hobbies, or acting.

The sisters stumble across a cult dedicated to what seems like a fundamentalist cult, complete with hand-waving Reverend Abraham Stockton (Tony Todd).  Todd is at a loss as how to emulate a fire-and-brimstone preacher - he comes off awkwardly stilted even in his ""divinely inspired"" moments. Of course, the entire cult he leads is actually following some demonic force.  I think.  It's hard to tell.

There are some interesting special effects.  Every time someone dies, there's an awful racket of screams and wails.  There's really no explanation for this (the souls are all going to hell, I guess), and not much of a reaction from the characters.  You begin to wonder if they can hear what the audience is hearing...

Because what we hear is pretty bad. Pulido is simply not a competent director.  The camera lingers on the girls limping and on villains stomping along.  Sympathetic murderers, claiming that ""they take no pleasure"" in their kills, are drowned out by the score, or by the sound of the wind, or by the girls talking off screen.  Pulido seems to have written The Graves script like a comic book, and he fills the audio with off-screen dialogue by the girls.  Just in case it's not clear: THERE ARE NO THOUGHT BUBBLES IN MOVIES.  Including thought bubbles might have helped a lot, actually.

The list of inanity goes on and on. The girls get possessed by some kind of smelly stench that makes them violent. They act out this violence by gnashing their teeth at each other like kids pretending to be dogs. Eventually, the girls are captured to be sacrificed to whatever is giving off that awful smell.  Since no monster ever shows up, we can only assume it's the movie itself that stinks.

By the end of the movie, the Graves sisters have the temerity to dub themselves ""monster killers.""  You get the impression Pulido had big plans for this to be his very own Buffy series, maybe even a comic book spinoff.  But there's no monster here. The scariest thing about this cynical comic book marketing mess is that it was made at all.",1294272000,12,3082,4.650646950092422
4066361,2,B00344EAJG,"Meg and Abby Graves head out on one last adventure before they go their separate ways after finishing school, but their road trip brings them to a haunted mining town that houses evil spirits from the past. The girls must gather their courage and arm themselves if they hope to escape Skull City alive! THE GRAVES is a weak Slasher hybrid that combines elements of a Western ghost tale. Brian Pulido's feature debut is completely devoid of character development and is filled with meaningless dialog, making it impossible to side with either of his two female protagonists when they do little to garner the audience's support. It is far more foolish than clever, and almost every attempt at humor falls flat. The deaths are equally unimpressive, providing mild amounts of blood, but very little gore. Even the addition of genre favorites Tony Todd and Bill Moseley can't help to save this failing film.

4066362,2,B00344EAJG,"The Graves (Brian Pulido, 2009)

Okay, yes, it's absolutely the case that The Graves, the first directorial feature from writer Brian Pulido, is unforgivably cheesy at times, and it's also the case that yes, this was an After Dark Horrorfest flick (and the vast majority of After Dark Horrorfest flicks are just plain awful, at least those made in America), but I'm not sure it entirely deserves the absolute savaging it's gotten. Pulido's script takes a few wrong turns, but overall it's not the worst thing I've seen recently that's played as straight horror (consider Against the Dark and Laid to Rest, also released in 2009). The cast is stocked with solid B actors, and the sets are absolutely gorgeous; the movie was filmed in Wickenburg, AZ, just up Rt. 60 from Phoenix in Yavapai County, one of the most picturesque places in America. Really, folks, you hated this more than The Gravedancers? Dark Ride? Unearthed? Frontier(s)? I'd rather watch this on a 24-hour loop than ever see another minute of those...

Plot: Megan (Walk the Line's Clare Grant) and Abby (American High School's Jillian Murray) Graves are the hosts of a popular comic-book webcast. Or they were; as the film opens, they're filming their final episode before Abby heads for New York to take a marketing job. After they wrap it up, Abby hauls Megan off to rural Arizona to take a gander at one of those weird little roadside attractions that you only seem to find in out-of-the-way America, the World's Biggest Thermometer. (Those of you who are geographically-inclined will have to swallow some disbelief in one pivotal scene, by the way. Said thermometer is in Baker, CA, a whole lot farther than the ""fifty miles at least"" the girls are told they're off by; it's more in the vicinity of three hundred, and had they kept driving in the same direction....) Anyway, they get lost and end up in a little roadside diner run by Darlene (A Nightmare on Elm Street's Amada Wyss, still hot after all these years).

Oh, I should mention: it was during this film that I coined Goat's Theory of Rural Radio. In any film which features a character in a car in an unfamiliar place scanning radio stations, they will find a fire-and-brimstone preacher.

In any case, Darlene expresses sympathy for the girls being so lost, then helpfully recommends a local attraction: Skull City, an old gold mine that's been restored and has old-time-stuff demonstrations and the like. We know it's an ugly place thanks to the preface, where the blacksmith re-enactor, Jonah Lee (The Governor's Shane Stevens, a very creepy-lookin' guy), slaughtered a family who stumbled into his exhibit. The girls don't know that, however, and off they go. And did I mention the fire-and-brimstone preacher is the great Tony Todd (Candyman, Final Destination, et al.)?

I haven't even scratched the surface of this cast yet. Bill Moseley (Home Sick, The Devil's Rejects, et al.)'s name on a low-budget horror film is a mark of pure quality. Lamb of God lead singer Randy Blythe pops up. Barbara Glover (Dead Beat) plays the mother of the clan of nutzoids who inhabit the mining town. Up-and-coming scream queen Cathy Rankin (R. E. M.) plays a victim. You see where I'm going with this. Pulido, correctly, decided to spend the majority of his budget on cast, cast, cast, and in my opinion it was a solid decision. The flip side of this is that not a great deal of the budget went to effects, and they decided to split that between gore and dumb supernatural stuff. Should've stuck with the gore, Brian. I was going alone just fine with this thing until the whole Jonah-Lee-Dust-Devil effect. What on earth was that all about?

In any case, think of this as a weird combo of The Hills Have Eyes and Children of the Corn and you'll be on the right track. It's not as good as the originals of either of those films, but it's miles better than either of the recent remakes, and if you're the same kind of Neanderthal I am, it's tough to go wrong with a movie containing this many very, very attractive women. **",1293062400,,4044,4.737215909090909
4066363,1,B00344EAJG,"I want back the hour and a half of my life that they wasted watching this.  I was, however, disappointed to find that I could not give it 0 stars.  Awful is not really adequate to describe this movie.  The only good thing I can say about it is, at least the female characters were not totally helpless.  Aside from that. . . the Arizona scenery was nice?  The acting was poor.  The stupid storyline was definitely lacking.  It was convoluted and contrived.  There was really no suspense or tension, kind of necessary in a horror movie.

Mostly though, the theme of ""crazy, evil religious people"" killing people is kind of offensive and a really tired and ineffective plot device.",1289001600,,679,4.591666666666667
4066364,2,B00344EAJG,"I'm rating this film 2 stars because it really runs the gambit on acting, from hysterically bad to sincere to how to shamelessly ham it up on screen.  Two gorgeous sisters, Clare Grant and Jillian Murray, find this crazy tourist attraction in the middle of nowhere. Actually, it's somewhere in Arizona.  Now these sisters are comic book fans..Really? Okay, these two lovelies are comic book fans who get chased by this maniac until the older sister disposes of the maniac and without much effort.  They stop a car to get help and (surprise) it's being driven by the maniac's brother who is nuttier than the first brother.  Bill Moseley puts on a pig's nose to pursue the girls through the sweltering heat.  Wearing the pig nose, he hams it up so ridiculously (Pig's nose - Hams it up) Anyway, he hams it up so shamelessly that not only is it not scary, but it is downright annoying.  It wasn't even funny as in it's so bad it's funny.  What was the director thinking?  Well, the two girls go running around the desert but nobody sweats despite the 100+ degree heat.  The older sister comes up with a plan to lure the brother away from the younger sister.  Again, I can only think ""Really?  That's the plan she came up with?""  Both girls suffer injuries but moments after they sustain injury they seem to be all right and continue along as if nothing had happened.  Also both girls wore tight black pullover tops with deep sccop necklines and the cameraman made it a point to catch the sisters bouncing as they were running or jumping or whatever.  There was also a demon in this film that fit in somewhere, but it was so convoluted as to if this was a slasher or what that the demon theme really added nothing except to give the sisters a chance to snarl and snap at each other in one of the silliest scenes ever to be recorded on film.  Bad as it was though, I made it through and while I felt like I'd wasted my time, it wasn't the worst film I ever saw, and therefore worthy of 2 stars.",1283472000,,1989,4.381471389645776
4066365,4,B00344EAJG,"There's no conceivable way ""The Graves"" could have been made well, so you might as well enjoy it for how bad it is. There isn't a brain a work in any of its eighty-eight minutes, but it goes through them so cheerfully that I actually found myself enjoying the experience. I shouldn't be recommending it, but unfortunately, I have a terrible tendency to like movies that clearly aren't any good (I may be the only person to have given a passing grade to ""10,000 B.C.""). Scoff all you want - the cast and crew were obviously having fun while making this movie. And why not? It gave them license to indulge not only in silliness, but also in cheap gimmicks, not the least of which is a relentlessly contrived plot and that most reliable of horror movie clichs: A small town populated by religious fanatics.

It's called Unity, and it's located somewhere in the deserts of Arizona. This is where we find sisters and comic book fans Megan and Abby Graves (Clare Grant and Jillian Murray), who wanted nothing more than to spend their last weekend together (Megan is moving to New York to pursue a career in marketing). They stumble onto Skull City, now a roadside attraction but once a thriving gold mine; behind its tacky, ramshackle faade of wood and rock lies a secret, one that, the sisters soon discover, brings death and apparent damnation to unsuspecting tourists. Roaming the site is a blacksmith (Shane Stevens), who at one point actually tries to calm his victim: ""I take no pleasure in this,"" he says while clutching a bloody hammer. ""I answer to a higher power!""

The sisters then run into Caleb Atwood, who says that his friends call him Cookie. We know he can't possibly be sane. Why? Because he's played by Bill Moseley, the go-to guy for maniacal horror movie weirdoes. Sure enough, his character dons a plastic pig snout before grabbing a sickle and chasing after Megan, apparently because he prefers his women young and plucky. He also flaunts an unusually strong sense of smell, as if he were part bloodhound. This may account for the snout, although I tend to doubt it; for all I know, it's a throwback to Moseley's involvement with ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,"" where he played the brother of the mask-wearing Leatherface.

Another part of the story involves the residents of Unity, all under the thumb of Reverend Abraham Stockton. He's played by Tony Todd, also a horror celebrity, as an overly pious caricature, with mannerisms so exaggerated and dialogue so inane that he's actually more funny than frightening. Was that the intended effect? I honestly don't know. Still, you've got to hand it to him - he hams it up really well. You watch him perform and can tell he was genuinely having a good time. I especially enjoyed his sermon near the end of the film: ""By all that's holy, what have we wrought? Say Jesus!"" he says before slitting someone's throat, not out of anger, but out of duty to the Savior. Only then does Megan calmly whisper to Abby, ""This is crazy,"" apparently unaware of the fact that statements this obvious are inherently funny.

Regardless, there's no denying that they believe what they're saying, and that should count as some kind of compliment to Grant and Murray. I will not go so far as to say that their performances are good, but within the context of a silly supernatural fright fest, they are doing the best they can possibly do. Their characters are established almost generically; they do, after all, have the notorious distinction of being young women in a horror story. But as the film progresses, we find that, in its own hilariously twisted way, it's aiming to be a parable about maturity, especially for Abby, always the more timid, less motivated half of the pair. I can't promise you will actually be inspired by anything this movie depicts, but then again, maybe you will be - I'm sure there are those among us for whom ""It's a Wonderful Life"" simply will not do.

In conclusion, if you're thinking to yourself, ""This movie sounds stupid,"" let me assure you that it is. It's so stupid, in fact, that I'm convinced it was intentionally made that way. I'm reminded of the 2007 horror film ""Hatchet,"" which was so aggressive in its efforts to be campy that it was actually kind of amusing. It inhabited its badness with conviction, which is more than I can say for the many, many bad horror movies that try to pass themselves off as serious work. At an artistic level, ""The Graves"" is about as upscale as gift shop keychain, and is even less lasting than smoke in a windstorm. All the same, it was infectious, and by the end, I had to admit to myself that I had fun watching it. It seems my standards aren't as high as I thought they were.",1271548800,6,4700,4.637454981992797
4066366,4,B00344EAJG,"Yes, so it is a straight to DVD release by the writer of many cult horror comics.  This movie was actually really good, considering that you are probably expecting a bad horror flick. It has a couple of horror icons in the cast to add a 'lil' flavor to a pretty decent movie. Guess what, some of the dialogue wasn't all that great but like I said - chances are you weren't expecting a whole lot from this movie. I suggest you make your own opinion of the movie, it might just suprise you-it did me.",1271548800,4,498,4.1875
4066367,2,B00344EAJG,"When I first heard about this film I heard nothing but bad. So I thought it would be good to watch it myself so I can come to a proper decision myself. Well me and a few friends got together and watched it one evening. The opening credits of the film were excellent (a true highlight), but as the film began I quickly realized I wasn't in Kansas anymore, and my hope of understanding this OZ was futile indeed.
 The Graves is a fusion of branches in the Horror genre. It attempts to blend ""Slasher"" film aspects with ""Paranormal"" aspects, but falls short of creating a convincing story for either. It seems rather jumbled throughout, and the background to the story is left quite empty, this can be good sometimes but in this case you find yourself grasping at air to understand what's happening.
 There seems to be a lack of suspense throughout the films entirety and this is on the director. He chose far away shots typically for chase scenes and that absolutely kills action. Imagine watching a golf cart drive from afar and then imagine being in one, it feels much different doesn't it? and these are the consequences of those decisions the director made. The suspense really was non-existent, and I felt bored even during scenes where the hammer wielding murderer is chasing his victim.
 The continuity of the film also is ripe with problems and I won't go into details, but there are things I think could have been saved by a better editor; but it's also distinctly possible that the editor didn't have all the shots he needed, and that fault would fall on the director's footage and or the writer's story.
 The acting in the film wasn't spectacular and I say that because there were some alright moments on everybody's part. The two main girls Clare Grant and Jillian Murray had pretty good chemistry but bad dialogue can drag even the best of them down. For less experienced actors such as Clare and Jillian there can be very ugly moments, and those moments litter the screen for everybody including the veterans.
 Tony Todd's character I found corny and clich, dare I say Blas, because he was the atypical preacher archetype who for some reason leads a cult that worships ""Legion"" the demon from the Bible, or is Todd legion? I don't know, it doesn't really explain it well. You can interpret the film anyway you want, because it's really that farfetched fundamentally. Overall Todd's dialogue was standard of these characters in horror films; he was bouncing around and yelling ""The Lord!"" really loud as movie preacher do.
 Bill Mosley I found the most convincing and the best actor in this film, but, and there is a major but, because his part wasn't written well (dialogue speaking) and you know my opinion on that. He does have a decent scene with Clare in a classroom which was far from impressive by any real movies standard, but it was a highlight next to the opening credits. Bill definitely was the Actor in the movie and surely he has great potential in any other movie that's written better.
 Overall when I finished this film I found myself rather disappointed. I heard bad things about it and I saw bad things in it, and I felt no edification at all from watching The Graves.
 A good film is unique, and its story is easy to follow yet it must be mysterious and unexpected from scene to scene. Unfortunately this film is very obvious throughout and has no surprises. The Graves is completely text book, which is a good quality for an Olympic event, but not for a piece of art, and this film surely is not one.
 Perhaps in an alternate universe this film is great. Maybe it has characters I like and want to prevail. Maybe it has villains whom I fear, villains that make me angry because of the injustice they do to the protagonists I support. Maybe it flows and has the stories voids filled in, and perhaps the events are explained cogently and to a level suitable for an audience, not just the writer who conceived the idea. Unfortunately this film is not in that universe and it does have these problems and for those and many other reasons I don't suggest this movie.",1270771200,5,4093,4.595890410958904
4066368,1,B00344EAJG,"What was this suppose to be a horror movie. I wasn't scared. I really didn't know what was going on. Bad acting by everybody. Bad sound effects.  One part of the movie the blond actress had a cut across the throat and a cut on the shoulder. After the church scene the throat cut was gone, the cut on the should was bandaged up and she was acting fine like nothing happened. Also what was the point of the cave that made everybody crazy. Then when they walked away they would be just fine. Was the demon living down there. What was the point of the demon. You need a back story. Like Freddy Krueger, Jason, Mike Myers you even got a back story in the poltergeist movie. Why was it there, why did the town want everybody dead. This movie was filmed in Arizona. You really think that two girls would be walking around in the desert with out water and sweating there butts off. This Brian guy needs to go back to school or making those forklift videos that companies use to train there employees. Maybe you should let your friends read the script before making a movie. They would of told you how bad it was. My friend made a better movie on a little sony camera at work just following everybody around. I would not recommended this film to anybody. I was burn this film and everything that went with it so that nobody would ever see this crap again.",1270512000,,1346,4.299212598425197

8388203,1,B00344EAJG,"Worst of all the After Dark films - tolerable only because they were fortunate enough to cast Clare Grant, who is at least stunningly hot. The film itself is devoid of thrills and chills and scares, the plot is tedious and insufferably boring, and the acting is sub-par - and all of this can be laid at the feet of the director. How he managed to botch an otherwise successful franchise is beyond me, but I think he was just thrust into the director's chair a few films sets too early.",1422748800,,485,4.34065934065934
8388204,4,B00344EAJG,"I figured this movie has a horrible set of reviews for it, and i love watching horrible movies. I was disappointed, it was NOT horrible! it was pretty decent.
Brief summary, since there seems to be none on the page. Two sisters, who are about to split ways for college decide to go on one last trip together.  Of course this being a horror film, it doesn't go that way, they end up going to a roadside diner, and getting some advice from a seemingly nice lady to visit the mines. From that point on, i don't want to give anything away.

For one, the picture quality is clear, which is a rare thing in the horror genre. The special effects were also good. The acting was, okay. But not the kind of bad acting that makes you turn off the movie, the cast as a whole does a great job, it's the mains that make you wonder a bit.

The writing is clearly Brian Pulido's, which makes it fantastic! it's very gritty, yet campy, bad ass and sassy.",1420588800,,937,4.223463687150838
