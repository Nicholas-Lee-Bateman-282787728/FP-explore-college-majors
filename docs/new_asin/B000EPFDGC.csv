2526370,5,B000EPFDGC,"Other reviewers have mentioned episode specifics, so I won't rehash that here.

What continues to shine during this season is how spectacular Patty Heaton is.  I can't imagine this show without her.  She brings such gravitas to the comedy and grounds the Ray/Debra marriage in a certain reality and believability.

Season 6 DVD features a handful of commentary tracks and a ""bonus retrospective"" that was actually run as a scheduled episode.  Ah, semantics!

Price is cheap compared to other season sets of top-level sitcoms.",1148083200,,525,5.190476190476191
2526371,5,B000EPFDGC,"This is the last season of ELR which I can safely say I found outstanding. It includes my favorite episode (The Lucky Pants) in which Robert interviews for an FBI job but Marie's intervention ruins his chances. It may or it may not be the best episode in the series but I know for a fact I didn't laugh out louder in any of the rest.

I was glad the very last episode of ELR was so good but, generally speaking, season 7-9 din't do it for me, I found Robert's in-laws to be a lot more irritating than funny, specially Chris Eliott who I simply can't stand.

By purchasing only seasons 1-6 I will be able to remmember ELR at its very best so this is where I get off.",1146009600,19,665,4.068702290076335

2526374,1,B000EPFDGC,"I can't stand ""Ray"". Something about the guy is just UNFUNNY. He is the equivalent of Laverne and Shirley; he isn't funny but what else is there for the time slot? I can't believe the show stayed on as long as it did... or can I? Even ""Reba"" lasted for awhile. What happened to actual comedians like Lucy or Gleason? Times change but comedy doesn't. Can you imagine this show lasting as long as I Love Lucy in syndication? I can't either.

Good Christ. I just learned this series was on for NINE YEARS!? Has TV been unwatchable THAT long? Apparently.

2526376,5,B000EPFDGC,"We received Season 5 on DVD just in time for Christmas, and now we get Season 6 to kick off the summer. Another terrific season with very funny episodes, as always.

There are the usual commentaries with Ray Romano, Phil Rosenthal, and some crew members. Patricia Heaton wasn't scheduled to be part of this season's commentaries, which is disappointing, but we get to hear Doris Roberts this time, and even though Romano and Rosenthal talk a lot more than she does in the commentary she's in, it's still fun to get some of her insights. I was especially excited to see that they included a commentary track for ""Talk to Your Daughter,"" which has a storyline about daughter Ally and includes an adorable scene at the very end with Ally and the twins. It was nice to see the cast and crew talk a little bit more about the kids (not much, but they mentioned them a couple times at least). That was one thing that was missing on the first 5 DVD sets, and I'm happy that they've included it here.

Some notable episodes from this well-written and successful season include ""The Angry Family,"" where a school essay from little Michael shows the Barone adults that their daily snits with each other are not going unnoticed; ""Marie's Sculpture,"" where Marie makes an absolutely outrageous creation that outdoes even herself; ""Cookies,"" where poor Ray gets more or less beat up by Ally's pushy troop leader; and ""Mother's Day,"" which begins a string of several episodes that chronicles Debra and Marie's biggest fight yet, and shows how it impacts the entire family. Some fans may be interested to know that they initially wanted to stretch the Debra/Marie estrangement for the entire Season 7, but they decided it ""wouldn't have been much of a show if they just left the men to talk to each other."" I personally think they could have made it work and found a way to do it in an upbeat and humorous tone, but the way they did it was great, too. There are many laughs to be had, but plenty of sweet and tender moments as well, all balanced out in classic ""Raymond"" tradition.

Only 3 more seasons to go after this one--with a little luck, maybe they will all be released before Christmas (although that may be a little bit of ambitious thinking). I'm sure we will definitely get them all within the next year, though, so get excited about completing your collections! :)",1141689600,36,2360,4.627684964200477

From the actual title of this episode, through to the final scene of the show, the irony of the storyline showcases one of the funniest comedic productions of any sitcom ever shown on TV.  Also, in this storyline, it is interesting to see that the character who makes the story work is not Ray, or Debra or Frank.  Instead, it is their little son, Michael, who is perfect as he reads his story, and as he glances at his family through the sweet, expressive eyes of a child.  Anytime I need a good laugh, I watch this episode, and I cannot help but laugh until it hurts.  As a matter of fact, I think I'll watch it right now...",1389398400,,727,4.2773722627737225

Still, so funny to watch her frustration and anger, and how she and Marie manage to turn the events against Ray and Frank.

The ensemble acting is wonderful, and Ray's ability to act confused and to manage to stick his foot in his mouth is hilarious.

My personal favorite character - Frank, played by the irreplaceable Peter Boyle - tends to get the funniest lines and steal the show - more power to him!

I choose this set because it was described very well. It stated that the cover looked new & used very little with no scratches or marks, which was what I was looking for and in the price range I could afford.

The set arrived within the time that was posted and in the condition that I expected from the small description of it. Very pleased & would order from this company again.",1220140800,,537,4.213592233009709
2526574,4,B000EPFDGC,"I'm a huge fan of this show, and I bought the full series box set.  I haven't bought the seasons individually as they were released, so I'm curious about the episode ""No Roll!"" in season 6 (the one where Ray buys the board game to play with Debra).  In the series box set, in this episode, as they're playing Sensuopoly on their bed, Debra rolls the dice and lands on a square that tells her to ""kiss your lover as though he going to climb Mount Everest"".  HUH???  In the original episode she says ""kiss your lover as though he's going off to war"".  Why on earth did the production company change the words?  You can clearly see the words don't match her lips!

I'm wondering if the individually-released season 6 DVD has this editing cut as well?  I just can't imagine why they couldn't keep the same words in there.  I realize this is from 2001, after 9/11, but it still doesn't make sense.  They were playing a board game!

Otherwise, the series box set is amazing.",1217376000,7,968,4.382022471910112

2526591,5,B000EPFDGC,"The sixth season introduced more double entendre than ever, but it really worked because there was a sort of bare bones ""innocence"" about the whole approach.  For example, two of the sexiest episodes, here, includes the show when Marie starts going to sculpture class and constructs an abstract that isn't really so much as abstract as graphic, and the ""stairs races"" program where Ray and Debra (Ray Romano and Patricia Heaton) have an accident in the bedroom, but lie to Frank (Peter Boyle) who thinks that their stairs need to be reconstructed.  There are numerous other excellent episodes, and they even feature one with their twin boys (the Sweetin twins) on a basketball team, where one boy is a little more athletically inclined than the other.  Great job again, and I can honestly say that I still love Raymond and so should you!",1180656000,,837,4.839160839160839
2526592,5,B000EPFDGC,"I've been buying each season of ELR because I can't get enough of that show even though it's on syndication all the time.  Most of the episodes are great, but there are a few annoying ones here. While season 5 of Raymond started with the Italy vacation episodes which I didn't care for that much, Season 6 ends with the Marie/Debra feud episodes that I don't like at all.  Still, some of my favorites from this season include ""The Angry Family,"" ""Jealous Robert,"" ""It's Suppose to Be Fun,"" ""The Kicker,"" ""Tissues,"" ""Cookies"" (with Peggy the evil leader of the Frontier Girls), ""Lucky Suit,"" ""The Skit,"" ""A Vote For Debra,"" and ""Call Me Mom"" (wow, there are a lot of good ones here).

Disc 1

""The Angry Family"": The Barones  are concerned about Michael's school presentation and seek advice from the school & Father Hubley.  This is a very funny one.  Debra really goes off!  Marie totally changes the subject when Frank makes a startling (well, not all that startling) observation.

""No Roll"": To spice things up, Ray buys a sensual board game. During the game, Debra makes the shocking admission that Ray can sometimes be (news flash!) selfish in the love department.

""Ray's Ring"": Robert flicks Ray's wedding ring in a hotel vent and, ringless Ray is hit on by a hot chick in the airport. To prove a point, Debra goes grocery shopping without her ring with different results.

""Marie's Sculpture"": Marie is very proud of a sculpture she made, but, to her family and even a group of nuns, it looks erotic.

Disc 2

""Frank Goes Downstairs"": Ray and Deb fall out of bed during whoopee and blame their injuries on the stairs.  Frank decides to fix the stairs and ends up in the hospital.

""Jealous Robert"": Debra and Marie hook Amy up with Gianni to get Robert jealous but the plan backfires.

""It's Suppose to Be Fun"": Raymond makes fun of Geoffrey during his basketball game so he quits.  One of my favorites.  I like when Geoffrey is about to attempt free throws and Raymond shouts, ""Whatever you do in life is great!""

""Older Women"": Debra's divorced parents visit for Thanksgiving and her very handsome father (Robert Culp) brings his older girlfriend.  I like when she says she feels like 21 but then has to be helped up the stairs for her nap.

""Raybert"": Raymond and Robert find that teaming up and switching identities is an effective way to attract chicks.

Disc 3

""The Kicker"": Finally, a sports-related episode!  You'd think there'd be more of these, Raymond being a sports writer and all (sometimes I forget what he does for a living).  Frank catches a record-breaking field goal at a Hofstra game and holds it for the highest bidder leading to a public outcry.

""Season's Greetings"": Marie and Debra work on a Christmas letter and the family is bummed that they don't sound impressive enough.

""Tissues"": Raymond wants to make more household decisions.  This is one of my all-time favorites.  The hose scene is classic!

""Snow Day"": The Barones hang out at Frank and Marie's house during a snowstorm and Debra says something that hurts Frank's feelings.  Kind of a downer episode.  I often skip this one.

""Cookies"": Ray gets into a confrontation with Peggy the Frontier Girls leader over the location of Ally's cookie booth.  Hilarious.

Disc 4

""Lucky Suit"": Robert has a job interview with the FBI and Marie accidentally burns his lucky suit--or was it an accident?  Another good one!

""The Skit"": Ray and Deb do a skit for Lee and Stan's anniversary making fun of Ray's parents but can't take jokes when the skit's on them. I like it when Ray calls Debra a ""cranky, uptight yell machine.""

""The Breakup Tape"": Debra is curious why Ray has kept an old cassette of a college girlfriend breaking up with him.  Raymond doesn't understand why Deb has kept presents from old boyfriends.

""Talk to Your Daughter"": Deb and Ray think Ally has questions about the birds & the bees but are blind-sided when her question is more profound.  The family's discussion of the meaning of life is really silly.

""A Vote for Debra"": Deb runs for President of the School Governing Board and Raymond isn't the most supportive.

Disc 5

""Call Me Mom"": Debra is mad that Raymond's mom won't let him call her mom, ""mom."" Deb tries to call Marie ""mom"" but she rejects her.

""Mother's Day""/ ""The Bigger Person"":  Continuation of a silly storyline.  Marie is offended when Debra refuses to drop everything to let her kids tell knock-knock jokes in front of Marie's friends.  They stop talking to each other for 4 episodes continuing into next season.  Raymond really rips Debra in the second episode; I'm surprised she let him get away with it.

""The First Time"": Deb and Marie are still not talking but the plot switches to a flash back showing Marie conspiring to keep Raymond and Debra from having premarital relations.",1180656000,3,4813,4.724759615384615

2526594,5,B000EPFDGC,"There are some GREAT moments in this season of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". I think my favorite episode here is ""The Skit"". It cracks me up everytime when I watch Marie and Frank do an impression of Debra and Ray at a party. If you only buy one season of Raymond, buy season 6 or season 4. Both are outstanding.

2526599,3,B000EPFDGC,"You never know what to expect with ELR.  That can be good, or it can leave you feeling like, ""Why did I just waste a half hour watching this?""  It has its funny moments, but I get tired of Frank berating Marie (it's way too predictable, and loses its intended humorous effect all too easily), and all the references to sex get old as well.  The funniest episodes just have to do with everyday life with Raymond and Debra, and their attempts to keep things together, amidst their own shortcomings, and the constant intrusions of pesky parents and a love starved brother.  Probably not worth the purchase, unless you are just an avid ELR fan.  Hope it helps!",1167782400,,656,4.52542372881356
2526600,5,B000EPFDGC,"I'm really glad for the release of these DVD box sets, because without them, I never would have gotten into this show...now one of my very favorites!

The plot centers upon Ray Barone, a sportswriter living on Long Island with his wife Debra and children Ally, Geoffrey and Michael. The bane of their existence is Ray's parents Marie and Frank...living just across the street, and acting like Ray and Debra's home is an extension of their own. To compound the problem, Ray's older brother Robert, a divorced NYPD lieutenant, moves back home...

This show doesn't look for sophisticated, implausible storylines. Rather, it focuses upon the tiny aspects of everyday life and relationships - father/son, husband/wife, brother/brother, parent/child - and finds comedy in the truth. Ray and Debra often clash, as he just wants to relax when he comes home from work, and she - a stay-at-home mom - wants him to pitch in, or go out. Frank is crass, and Marie is nosy and opinionated.

Season 6 includes the classic episode ""Marie's Sculpture,"" where the elder Mrs. Barone makes an abstract sculpture in art class, which resembles female genitalia...to everyone but her.

If you're unfamiliar with this show, check it out! You'll soon be laughing hysterically and looking for the rest of the seasons.",1164931200,2,1292,5.0233644859813085
