8113384,1,B000EQHXD2,"I got this DVD because I wanted a longer all-cardio workout thats more than just plyometrics, and Id heard that Mindys good. At first, I was worried that her chattiness would get on my nerves, and her hyper personality is indeed annoying to me, but what really bothers me is the way shes making jokes when she should be cuing. I previewed the video a little because it is a little more complex than what Im used to, but that didn't help me much. The moves themselves are easy enough and the variety is nice, but because the pace is so quick and she changes the moves up so frequently (and like I said, without much cueing--she even throws her background exercisers off now and then) that its actually kind of dangerous. Ive been doing a variety of workouts, including step, for more than 15 years, and though my knees have gotten a little sensitive over time--they would sometimes hurt a little after a tough week--doing this workout three or four times six months ago has changed the way I work out now; my knees may never be the same. What I originally thought was a fun workout is now in the trash dump, and I want other people to know what risk they may be taking. If you have any doubts about this one, skip it.",1388361600,,1216,4.361233480176211
8113385,2,B000EQHXD2,This DVD is also to fast paced and choreographed for me.  It was frustrating trying to keep pace.  It might appeal to anyone who wants a lot of choreography and every changing program.,1187827200,,184,4.545454545454546
8113386,5,B000EQHXD2,"What a great workout.  It uses step and a medicine ball if you want extra intensity.  It's kind of unique and Mindy is actually a great instructor.  She's full of energy and very motivating.  She's slowly becoming a favourite of mine.

After about a 9 minute warmup, you do about 50 minutes of short yet fast aerobic/anaerobic intervals.  This is the best way to get fit quicker and maximise weight loss.  If you don't have a medicine ball, you could easily use dumbells instead.  She has done some great choreography; moves like peg leg road runner and soccer dribbles.

This is tough yet fun, and it's unique too.  Using this dvd along with what you already own, will keep things interesting and mix up your routine to get your body in top notch condition.",1149638400,5,758,4.58955223880597
