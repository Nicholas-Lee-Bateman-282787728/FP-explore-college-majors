8676502,2,B00N83PETS,"This DVD is a low quality duplication of the ""Gotham"" release on Metropolis Records and appears to be nothing short of a professionally packaged bootleg. Do NOT buy. It is the exact same title! Even the title screen shows that this is ""Gotham."" The quality of the video is significantly degraded from the Metropolis records official release however and this should be avoided at all costs.",1335312000,3,389,4.909090909090909
