That surprised me, but I was pleased to see the skaters who were on the DVD. There wasn't a pattern to who was featured on the DVD that I could discern.  As always, though, I wish the DVD were longer and had more performances on it.",1366243200,2,349,4.2727272727272725
8006050,3,B00013F290,"I enjoyed the DVD.  I would probably rate it as 3 1/2 stars.  It has some really good skaters and competitions in it.  I've never been much of a Tonya Harding fan since her competition so I could have done without her in it. I like competitions, but I like the more laid back shows better, like Stars on Ice and special evenings with the skaters, so that is why I rated this the way I did.  I would still recommend it to others to add to their collection.",1143244800,4,455,4.078651685393258
