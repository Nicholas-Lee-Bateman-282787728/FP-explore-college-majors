The scenery ... is staggeringly beautiful. There's a definite style, and it's beautiful.
The animation is filled with time to let you take in the subtleties, not only of the picture, but of the story, but I don't think you'll be asking for it to hurry up, because when you're watching you WANT that time. You need it to see everything, take it all in.

A fantastic picture, fantastic voicing; and I'm sure the story will be just as good.",1246838400,2,526,4.26
8225487,5,B000WTDH6S,"I watched this whole series about 8 months ago.  It is extremly well put together.  Great romance story, with a very emotional ending.  They weave two and a half stories together, which is executed quite well.  If you like the romance genre, definitely pick up this whole set.  But unless you are made of money, I would wait until it comes out as a box set first.

Plot Summary: The anime revolves around two protagonists, Hirono Hiro and Asou Renji. On Christmas Eve, Hirono Hiro meets a girl named Miyamura Miyako who was chasing a purse snatcher. Hiro later finds out that Miyako also goes to the same school as he does and they start hanging out together. This made Hiro's childhood friend, Shindou Kei, feel left out. Kei then tries to compete with Miyako for Hiro's affection and a love triangle ensues. The anime also tells the story of Asou Renji. Renji meets a girl named Shindou Chihiro at an abandoned train station. He soon learns that Chihiro suffers from a type of amnesia where her memory span only lasts for 13 hours. He also discovers Chihiro's dream of writing a novel, but she has never been able to fulfill that dream due to her condition. Renji then decides to help her fulfill that dream.

This is a pretty clean anime, no real nudity.  There are a few scenes with the girls in their under wear, and a some implied sex scenes where they show them together after the fact, but they don't show anything just some cleavage.

Once again great series a true 5 star set, I really hope they do dubb it in english and make a box set out of it.  Even though I think the japanese voice actors are awesome in this set, my wife hates reading subtitles.  I can't wait to see Ef-a tale of melodies.",1244937600,3,1706,4.435897435897436
