The description on this item (which is the same description on the jewel case of this DVD) pretty much sums up the contents and gist of this documentary. However to add to that, this film has stunning scenery, artwork and meditative music that really enhances its message. Furthermore, the brilliance of it is further enhanced by its interviews of young adults who give their testimonies on the importance of prayer, the fruits of it in their personal lives and the benefits they derive from it. This would really speak to young people as this show makes it really contemporaneous and teenagers and adults will be able to identify themselves with the young adults in this programme as opposed to hearing this message merely from priests and religious.

It is replete with scriptural references and quotes and sayings of the Saints, such as St. Therese of Lisieux, St. Teresa of Avila, St, Ephrem the Syrian, Bl. John Hernry Newman, to name a few.

1. What is prayer?

3. Preparation
4. Disposition
5. Types of prayer
6. Regularity
7. Facing Difficulties
8. The Saints
9. The Holy Mass
10. End Goal.

Also a significant part of it is given to the recitation of the Most Holy Rosary and the Role of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Holy Spirit in cultivating and fostering an authentic life of prayer.
