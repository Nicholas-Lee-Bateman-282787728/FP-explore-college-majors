7796409,5,1563642506,"This movie{French with English subtitiles}.tells the story of the Village of Le Chambon,led by its pastor, Andre` Trocme. A Truly Astonishing story ,told in subtle understated fashion,the outline of wich is; during WWII,a French village located in the mountains,begins to take in Jewish children and hide them, care for them protect them. Led By Pastor Trocme, a pacifist,these villagers saved thousands of children, at great cost,{some of the leaders died in the concentration camps} This movie succeeds on many levels on of which, very difficult in telling such a story, in painting NO ONE IN BLACK AND WHITE. all the players have good and bad sides,and all are portrayed. The child actors are particilarly excellent, showing the back and forth playful nature that children will exhibit even in the worst of situations. I cannot praise this movie enough in that it shows the TRUE COST OF GRACE. Wonderful family viewing[though a difficult subject,children KNOW that bad things exist},excellent on every level. I Cannot Praise this film highly enough. Related books, available at Amazon are  LEST INNOCENT BLOOD BE SHED,and Angels and Donkeys by Andre trocme.",980208000,26,1160,5.27027027027027
