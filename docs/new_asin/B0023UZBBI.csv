3842109,4,B0023UZBBI,"Forever Strong is a wonderful, albeit underrated film about a young man who discovers what's really important in his life after he nearly throws it away in a freak car accident.  Sean Faris finally does a film he can be proud of (hopefully forgetting that cliche Never Back Down)while Gary Cole shines as the coach who shows his players what the true meaning of integrity and honor are.  This film did not get the accolades it deserved.  It is right up there with Remember the Titans and Friday Night Lights as a classic sports film.",1241740800,40,533,4.589473684210526
3842110,5,B0023UZBBI,"Anyone who has seen Remember the Titans, Rudy (Sean Astin is in this movie, too!), Glory Road, Believe in Me, and other classics that are about LIFE first, then the particular sport will love Forever Strong just as much, if not more.

From the most dedicated rugby player or fan, to youth and church groups, to your own family, this movie will resonate with and present value to everyone who sees it.

For those who don't know about rugby, Forever Strong exemplifies the way a player becomes part of a family and only then, becomes part of a team.  As the saying goes, ""There is no 'I' in 'Team'.  Nor is there an 'I' in rugby.  The sport, and the spirit of the game, is unmatched in any other sport.  Honestly, in what other sport can you crunch and be crunched by your opposition, only to eat, drink, and bond with them after the match?  ...And so goes and GROWS the family that is rugby.",1240099200,,890,4.357575757575757

His life has been about rugby so he is given the opportunity to play rugby because the story is also about rugby.

3842197,4,B0023UZBBI,"Set in and around Arizona, FOREVER STRONG concentrates on the world of junior rugby union. Rick Penning (Sean Faris) plays for the Razorbacks, a competent side whose members spend their leisure hours drinking and enjoying themselves. Things take an unfortunate turn after a car accident where Rick was driving; he is sent to a juvenile detention center where he abruptly ostracized by his fellow-inmates.

Rick is invited to play for Highland, the local rugby team. As in his first years in prison, he occupies the position of an outsider, believing himself to be superior in terms of ability to his teammates, and refusing to respect the words of coach Larry Gelwix (Gary Cole). Time passes; and Rick eventually undergoes a significant change of character, as he comes to understand the psychological advantages of playing for the team, not just for himself, and following Highland's mantra of never doing anything to embarrass himself, his team, or his family.

The story is a familiar one, explored on a wider canvas by Clint Eastwood in INVICTUS (2009). Rugby union might be a violent sport, but it teaches players to respect themselves as well as others; to conduct themselves appropriately at all times, both on and off the field; and to understand the importance of listening to oneself as well as to others. The virtues of the game are summed up by the haka, commonly associated with the New Zealand All Blacks, but here practiced by the Highland team as a mark of tradition, a challenge and a recognition of the power of family past and present.

The legendary All Black Syd Going makes a cameo appearance, but the film really belongs to Cole as coach Gelwix, who apparently does nothing except sit in a chair on the sidelines offering advice, but possesses a unique ability to judge individual characters. In the past Rick's rugby-playing father Richard (Neal McDonough) had issues with Gelwix, that he has never been able to deal with; but at the end of the film the two men are reconciled in a mutual understanding of rugby's socializing power.

Competently filmed (by Ryan Little) with a fine sense of landscape, FOREVER STRONG is an uplifting piece, which only serves to increase confusion among rugby fans. If American high school rugby is so competitive and strong, why can't the country produce a stronger national team to compete at the World Cup?",1467676800,2,2365,4.919799498746867

It is truly a moving story based on different players in Highland rugby history (as seen in the special features, it is not any one story, but a combination of many different stories).  I watch this every week before my Collegiate matches, and it motivates me every single time.  This is a must see movie for anyone that is a fan of touching movies.",1443139200,,446,4.285714285714286

3842251,5,B0023UZBBI,What sets this sports story apart from so many others is that it tells its TRUE story in a honest way that really reflects to coach who inspires young men to be the best that they can be. We know this as we listen to the excellent commentary track between director Ryan Little and Coach Gelwix. The coach adds as much to the excellence of the commentary as does the director. His strength and conviction of ethics is apparent in listening to his remarks. This comes through in the film itself as Ryan Little has done an unusually fine job with his cast in giving the viewer an honest feeling for the strengths of the good coach and the power of influence that it can have on his players. Beautifully photographed and edited this is a class film in every way.,1439251200,2,758,4.382978723404255

3842279,5,B0023UZBBI,"I am not a sports fan, but I have discovered that many movies which have a sports setting are actually stories about building an honorable character.  Forever Strong has a wonderful story-line, featuring the need for both Rick and his father to build  stronger character.  In this case, Rick's father is not sufficient for the job, but his counselor at the juvenile detention center, his fellow hockey players, and Coach Gelwix get the job done admirably.  Not a single character is unnecessary to the plot -- even the minor characters make essential contributions toward telling the story. Prior to purchasing the DVD, I watched the movie several times on Netflix, but purchasing the DVD allowed me to enjoy the excellent Special Features. The real-life Coach Gelwix presents his philosophy about turning out boys with great character, not simply winning hockey games (though winning is important, of course).  Also, there is more information about ""The Haka"" among the Special Features.  I think this movie can be appreciated by young teens through oldsters, such as me.",1414368000,3,1072,5.132183908045977

3842324,4,B0023UZBBI,"Despite the PG-13 rating, it is appropriate for young kids.  There's no nudity or swearing (one middle finger that's subtle enough that the kids didn't see it), and the violence is related to rugby with a couple punches thrown during off-field fights.  The PG-13 must be for the alcohol and drugs (which are portrayed as pure evil).  Our kids are between 5 and 9 and I only once hovered my finger over the fast-forward button, but didn't need to worry.

It was great to watch with the kids, but I would not recommend it for date night.  It's a mostly-predictable character/redemption sports movie, but well done.  The rugby action is pretty good, there are a couple of minor twists to keep it interesting, and there are some laughs.",1401408000,,732,4.6796875

3842326,5,B0023UZBBI,"If one is sinister enough, one could potentially see this movie as a propaganda for a certain religious sect based in Utah, given the coach's association with the church.  Having that said, things like basic human values, work ethics, and family relationships are universal to all of us regardless of religious affiliations, and this movie weaves these elements skillfully into the outwardly sport oriented storyline.  I grew up watching rugby with my dad, so it was nice to see an underrated sport (at least in this country) be the focus of a movie, but even if I didn't have any background knowledge of the sport, I am sure I would equally enjoyed watching this. What Larry Gelwix accomplished over the years at Highland is truly remarkable.",1401321600,,743,4.888888888888889

Fortunately, a coach is willing to give him a chance to change his life. The moral is spot on for today's youth! The coach in the movie is actually based on a real life hero; a coach who indeed sacrifices his time and energy to help youth improve themselves.

There have been times in my life when I've felt angry, disappointed, hurt by others. And then I carried those feelings into other relationships, with a heart on alert to wage war. This entertaining film shows a transformation in one young man who experienced those same feelings-and through his heart of peace he was able to love and to forgive.

It's not superbly acted but the story keeps your interest. It would be helpful for couples or families or friends with tension to watch and discuss how taking responsibility for your own feelings can make a difference in your relationships.",1388966400,2,771,4.825757575757576

Since the movie states that it was based on true events, I think I enjoyed it even more.  It's great to see how a sport (any sport), coaches and friends/teammates can influence a kid for the better.  If it wasn't for sports, some kids would have taken the wrong path.  If your someone that is involved in sports right now, this movie would be great to watch with your teammates.

Whether we are on a team or not this story shows these rare-core-values gave him insight to help thousands become the best human beings on and off the field. Every person and family in the world could use these internal-character-strengthening-keys to make powerfully honest decisions for generations to come.  We all go through struggles in our life and how we approach the smallest or deepest-battles will greatly impact what kind of a person we become.  These keys need to be 101 decency classes taught from birth throughout life.,1366416000,,594,5.051020408163265
3842443,4,B0023UZBBI,"There's nothing new for a sports drama here - except rugby itself, to most of us Americans - but it makes a decent family film nonetheless, with a believable if sometimes overwrought father-son relationship at the core.",1365724800,,219,4.945945945945946

Because of this young people have no guidelines in life and they are driven around by the winds of societal whims and the opinions of their friends that are just as confused and screwed up as they are.  This leads them into self destructive lifestyles.  Forever Strong is a great movie about what immature, self destructive young people in the world today need in their lives to turn them in mature adults.",1365638400,,571,4.367924528301887

I thought a movie about rugby would be boring as I have never heard of the game but I am definitely glad that I watched this movie.  I will watch it again and again and recommend it to family and friends. If you are looking for something to watch with your children I would encourage you to do so.

3842449,5,B0023UZBBI,"Loved this movie for several reasons:

1) It is a true story - not some fabricated feel good story that came out of Hollywood. The credits show the record of the team! What an amazing showing of sacrifice and dedication that this coach has to his life mission.

2) It deals with sacrifice and hard work, but much more important than that is integrity. The parts where two different players confess their indiscretions (at different times) - which cost them valuable playing time is huge. It was much more important for them to be transparent and come clean than it was to play rugby (and they helped out tremendously in other ways - such as setting the example to their teammates and coaching others).

3) It was great how the main character was accepted and lifted up - even when he was behaving badly.

4) It shows how love and discipline are the keys to turning boys into ""real"" men.

5) The plot just keeps getting better throughout the movie.",1364688000,,947,4.547058823529412
3842450,5,B0023UZBBI,"I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. This film is heartwarming. It's about a reckless boy becoming a responsible man. This film shows that being on a team and playing a sport isn't just about winning, but rather becoming a better person for having played the sport. It's about the choices we make and the things we do that define us and give us purpose.",1364256000,,362,4.260869565217392

Whether you know anything or nothing about rugby, this movie isn't solely focused around the sport and when they do show them playing, there is enough explanation for you to follow along.

3842479,5,B0023UZBBI,"Truly an inspiring and well-crafted film.

Like other reviewers have mentioned, this film is not primarily about rugby. The narrative themes of the wayward son finding redemption and latching onto something bigger than himself, and the healing of estranged relationships, are familiar ones, albeit wrapped in a slightly unfamiliar context of rugby. The predictability of the narrative arc is not a weakness, as the story is told with heart and excellence. The characters are compelling, the music and camera work are excellent, and the script is good. Many of the lines said in this film could easily have crossed the line to cheesiness, but kudos to the actors for not crossing that line. The only complaint I have is that some of the characters are too one-dimensional for me, particularly the main character's antagonists (his former teammates), but I suppose that is a limitation of the medium that is hard to overcome.

Definitely take the time to watch this film - I hope it leaves you as inspired to live strong as it did me. Highly recommended!",1354320000,,1052,4.937853107344632

I work with teenagers so we use it as part of programming but I just ordered it for my own son, who is a rugby addict. It's a great film. I'd recommend it for any teenager, who will also love it. There's no preaching. No deep lesson that tells of an agenda....it's good to watch for all the normal reasons and the positive messages are just a bonus. Buy it...you'll never regret watching it.",1353024000,,468,4.453488372093023
3842482,5,B0023UZBBI,Great movie! I would recommend this movie for parents with teens. We need to remember our children have their own lives and we need to respect that. We as Christian parents are to help guide our children so they will make the right choices. It's so easy to try to force our children to do what we think they should do.,1352073600,,318,4.229508196721311

3842487,5,B0023UZBBI,"This movie is NOT about the game of Rugby itself but a story with multiple parts:

1. The relationship between a father and son that is rocky and through commonality eventually becomes repaired.
2. The strength a sport (even if portrayed pourly) or a family unit (team) can strengthen that of a troubled young man and turn his life around.

Was the rugby portrayed the way rugby should be.  Heck not. But the meaning and story of the movie is truly an inspiration.",1344816000,,464,4.566265060240964

As a lifelong rugby player, then coach, this is an unrealistic portrayal of the game (for rugby knowledgeable readers; a winger is put in as hooker to give him a little life lesson. Apparently, how to go about snapping your neck).

The Haka, a traditional Maori war dance, has nothing to do with rugby's origins and is performed by one international rugby team in the world, New Zealand's All Blacks. Why is this being performed by a team in Utah? A culturally more appropriate tradition to honor is rugby's roots in gaelic football. Anyway, the sentimentality is trite and factually inaccurate.

3842513,5,B0023UZBBI,"I was babysitting when the girls I was watching begged to watch it. They had rented it from netflix and had watched it with their parents the night before. Them being the young little girlie girls they are, I could not believe it when they described a rugby movie, very much geared towards young men. I also was wary of the PG-13 rating, but their parents apparently approved, so we put it in. Just a few minutes into it, I was hooked! ""Forever Strong"" is an amazing movie that, unlike so many mainstream movies today, shows the consequences for drugs and DUI and other reckless choices.
Apart from a little bit of wishy-washy Mormonism teaching and a scene where the main character flips someone off (it's mostly obscured, as seen on the edge of a security camera), this movie is nearly perfect. There's no verbal foul language, no sex or nudity (the party scenes feature girls in bikinis and a little flirting, but the directors kept it tame, and while older audiences know what would be going on, younger kids won't be exposed to anything inaproppriate. The rugby scenes get a little rough, but nothing graphic at all.
I highly reccomend this movie to anyone--families, girls, guys...it would make an excellent group movie night flick. With sports, great lessons, strong morals, a touch of romance, and absolutely gorgeous guys (haha:) it has something for everyone. Ten out of five stars!!!",1310860800,,1394,4.8125

It not only helped us understand the game but the story line was inspirational. Our teens even enjoyed the movie.  Redemption is a strong point as several other virtues are extorted.

I was surprised when Netflix rated it as four stars for me, but since they are seldom wrong, I decided to watch it. I was so blown away at how much I liked it that I had to order a copy for myself and to let my sports fan friends watch. I was extra glad I ordered it because in the special features I could learn the meaning of the haka as told by the real life coach that was portrayed in the movie. Also in special features was Life Lessons told by the real coach. He would make a great motivational speaker, by the way. I can see why the Highlanders have such a great win record over the years that he has coached.

Side Note: I liked what someone said during the movie comparing American football to rugby. In essence it was said that we stole rugby, added sissy pads and helmets and call it football. Rugby appears to be just as brutal as football but they wear no protective gear.

By the way, why do they call it football when probably less than one percent of the game is played with the feet.

3842555,5,B0023UZBBI,"USA Rugby partnered well with this film's producers and distributors when it opened, and a lot of rugby clubs held screenings all over the country as fundraisers; I went to the TC Williams Rugby showing in Alexandria, Virginia.  Unfortunately, this film was packaged as, and consequently was received by the American movie-going public as ""the rugby movie.""  So unfortunately it didn't do well, and was out of theaters quickly.  That's too bad, as this is not a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/rugby/dp/0473096218/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">rugby</a>&nbsp;movie.  It's a movie about values and ethics, honesty and integrity, honor and respect, about family and team, and ultimately about growth, redemption, and the transformative power of making a genuine effort, set in the context of rugby.

This is an excellent family film, and even better for just dads and sons to watch together.  For the non-rugby viewers: it doesn't matter if you don't know a thing about rugby.  For the ruggers: you'll love a well-crafted movie on teamwork, with accurate portrayals of our game.

This movie is not about rugby; it's about teaching young men the value of teamwork, camaraderie, and that everyone benefits when you become part of something bigger than yourself.  This movie is about sacrifice, honor, integrity, and the power of working as a group toward a shared goal.  Highland Rugby is the unstoppable juggernaut of American U-19 rugby not because they work harder, but because every single young man in that organization works for the betterment of the team, and not for himself.  In this environment, winning becomes merely a by-product.

Synopsis: A talented yet vain high school rugby star ends up in juvie after a DUI.  The angry and arrogant hard case is brought into the Highland rugby program and slowly learns the power of teamwork, selflessness, and becoming part of something bigger, which makes him a better man, and a winner.

Comparisons to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Remember-the-Titans/dp/B000056VP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Remember the Titans</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-Night-Lights/dp/B00005JNEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday Night Lights</a>&nbsp;are in order, the only difference here being that the sport is unfamiliar rugby.  No matter; if you or your kids come out of it wanting to see what rugby is all about, all the better.  If you are a rugger, then you will recognize the joy in teamwork you've come to love, enjoy the accurate action sequences, and will be happy to see the game treated very well, with very little modification to make it palatable to the rugby-ignorant greater public.

Alcohol and drugs are very clearly portrayed negatively throughout the film, and by the end our hero/former party-boy makes positive choices, on his own and for the right reasons. That being said, this film is not Disney-sweet or preachy, and also shows that these rugby players are not choir boys.  They are very serious hard-chargers who know how to have fun, but fun that is legal and does not bring shame to themselves, their team or their families.

Refreshingly, the film does not shy away from the fact that rugby is an intense, full-contact sport and that top-level play is a rough environment.  There are lots of bruises, and a bit of blood.  One player gets a gnarly bloody nose, which he wipes off with grass.  One scene, taking things a bit too far I think, showed a medic pulling a tooth from a gash on a player's forehead.  Now, I've seen this injury myself, more than once, so it's legit, but showing it in the movie is not a good way to get kids--and more importantly their protective parents--to come out to learn and play rugby.

The rugby play is excellent, very well represented and accurate.  There are a few very well done action sequences with the camera integrated into the action, with good accompanying sound, which is very much like being involved in actual play.  The match play-by-play integrates well to explain what is happening.  The referee reactions are also completely in keeping with the game, such as when the ref sends our boy off with a red card early in the movie, and when an opponent receives a yellow card near the end.

There are some powerful dramatic moments in this film, definitely not maudlin or syrupy, and yes, they did get this 28-years-playing lock forward's eyes to water.

As a youth rugby coach, I wish there were a way I could legally make dozens of copies of this film and hand one out to every single one of my players.  No, this movie will not teach them how to play rugby, but if it teaches them about honesty and integrity, and the power of effort and teamwork, then most of my job as coach is already done.

Here's my suggestion to readers/buyers: buy a copy, and when you're done with it, give it to a friend, and ask them to pass it on.  I've already done this; let's get this movie moving through the community.  Let's get kids excited about rugby, and whether they play or not, let's get kids to realize the power of ethical behavior, and how it can have immediate and real benefits for them and those around them.

Bottom line: This is a straightforward bad-boy teen redemption tale, with a predictable plot line.  You know where it's going to end up, and basically how it's going to get there.  But the characters and story are powerful, and they deliver a very well crafted message of respect, integrity and teamwork, without beating you over the head with the overused Hollywood Message Mallet.  All of this takes place in the context of a real-life high school rugby success story.",1258675200,99,5732,5.151187904967602

3842557,5,B0023UZBBI,"Our family skipped over this video when it first came out thinking it was just another sports video.  We rented it later and my family loved it.  Our two boys (ages 10 & 14) watched it several times.  I bought our first copy for our family, then 3 more copies for several families that would also benefit from it.  They have also enjoyed it.

The lessons taught extend beyond sports.  The movie is not preachy.  The acting was above what I expected.  And the plot/character development was enjoyable to watch.  Anyone, 10 and older, who wants to learn about making better choices in life should watch this movie.  I imagine that you will also like the movie if you are a Rugby fan.

3842558,5,B0023UZBBI,"This is a movie with a plotline that has become all too familiar in the area of football films.  Except this plot involves Rugby.  A boy who leads a frat boy wild child life in high school gets sent to the Juvenile home after injuring his girlfriend while driving drunk.  His Mother is an enabler so to speak and his father is solely concerned about winning rugby at all costs.  While at the Juvenile home he is miserable and tries to make everybody else miserable.  Until, he is sent to play Rugby with the Highland team.  His Dad's team's rival.  Resentful at first he finally starts becoming a part of the Highland team and the coach's philosophy that while he wants to win, it isn't at all costs.  He even takes a loss to teach the boys a lesson.  In a twist to the story, the boy is reformed,sent home, then sent back to the juvenile home after an episode with his Dad's team's players.  But, all turns out well at the end.  The boy does a good job of acting like the typical jock jerk until his reformation. And the movie is pretty well done. Just a few minor criticisms, his second love interest comes across as a wild girl rather than a girl for a reformed fellow. And the boys all have misplaced resentments against their parents.  It is still very much a worthwhile movie, however.",1256342400,,1291,4.378151260504202

I love Rugby so this movie got my attention right away. I am also already a fan of a few actors in the movie and putting all that together for this one movie made it great, funny and sad. I loved it and probabally watched it 3 or 4 times within the first 10 days of having it. If you haven't seen it you should.",1255824000,,466,3.9680851063829787

3842561,5,B0023UZBBI,"As previously mentioned, this movie is based on the Highland High School rugby team in Salt Lake City who just won their nineteenth national championships this year (2009).

The story is about talented but troubled Flagstaff high school rugby player Rick Penning (Sean Faris) who gets into a car crash after drinking and driving recklessly, which puts his girlfriend in the hospital and him in juvenile detention.  Home administrator Marcus Tate (Sean Austin) offers Rick a chance to get back in the game by playing for his rival, Highland Rugby.  Reluctantly Rick joins the team where he goes through a demanding training schedule and unique code of conduct that Coach Larry Gelwix (Gary Cole) enforces.  Rick eventually learns that winning isn't everything, but attitude is.  He ends up facing his old team, who is coached by his father, Richard Penning (Neal McDonough) in the National Championship.

In the special features section, real life Coach Larry Gelwix discusses his codes of conduct such as, ""Attitude and effort are more important than natural smarts. Attitude and effort are more important than natural ability.  But if you want to change your attitude there's only one way to do it -- you change your behavior.""

Being that I only go to the theatres maybe twice a year, I had never heard of this movie until it was suggested on my movie rental list.  My family watched it a week ago and we totally enjoyed it!  I though it was especially great for my 12 year old son because of its powerful messages of integrity, honor and hard work.",1254355200,,1551,4.840909090909091

3842563,5,B0023UZBBI,"This movie is an all time favorite of our family's.  It is loved by my 3 year old as well as the older kids and adults.  The rating for PG-13 must come from the short party scene in someone's backyard after a rugby game, but all it shows is a few kids drinking.  There is no language or sexual content in this film.  Forever Strong has a wonderful message of a young man who turns his life around and how an awesome coach teaches his team to be respectful young men on and off the field.

That Gelwix continues to build strong young men while also continuing to dominate the rugby scene is as clear evidence as any could be that the principles he teaches and lives by, work.",1250035200,,386,4.661764705882353
