8731775,5,B004FOLZU6,"This is a powerful and inspiring film about people fighting for their own freedom and rights.  It should be seen by all Americans, and not just during Black History Month.  The film is only 30 minutes long, but packed with valuable information that is sadly often left out of the textbooks.  The DVD, together with the educational tools available on the film's website ([...]), is a great resource for teachers and anyone else who works with kids.  The DVD can be shown in the classroom or at home, to be enjoyed by the entire family.  I highly recommend it as a gift or for your own history collection!",1291852800,,603,4.546296296296297
