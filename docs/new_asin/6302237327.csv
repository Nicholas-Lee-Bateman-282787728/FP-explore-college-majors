7822464,2,6302237327,"Across Five Aprils is a beloved children's book from the 1960's that tells the story of a boy and his family during the Civil War. The book is good -- the movie is not.
The book attempts to tell the same story, and tries to cut out the excess, but unfortunately the soul of the story is gutted in the process. Also, the villain of the story is changed and altered from the book so drastically that I wouldn't even say it was ""based"" on the book.
It isn't available from Amazon and for good reason. Stay away.",1381881600,,508,4.1938775510204085
7822465,2,6302237327,"I was very disappointed with this made-for-TV movie, especially after reading the deeply moving novel upon which the movie is based (Across Five Aprils, by Irene Hunt).

The Creighton family's life was never easy, but now they must deal with the uncertainties, prejudices and hatred brought on by a country fiercely divided by civil war. The book and movie focus on Jethro, a little boy forced to grow up quickly during the war years. He suffers loss, assumes the backbreaking work of a man, and carries the responsibility of making a life-or-death decision for the family. Although much of the dialogue from the book was retained, the characters were not well developed in the movie, which left me not caring so much about them. I was also disappointed that the film didn't give more insight into the poignant decision of one brother to fight for the Confederacy while his family and town are for the Union.

Finally, one of the main plot lines was changed significantly from the book. I suppose it made for better TV drama, but I preferred the story as it was. It's a touching tale of the bonds of family and friendship, duty, perseverence, and sacrifice--unfortunately, the film wasn't able to convey the deep emotions of the book.",1137283200,,1234,4.816037735849057
7822466,4,6302237327,"Civil War Diary is the story of Jethro Creighton and his family living in Southern Illinois at the begining of the American Civil War.  It is based on the Newberry Prize winning book Across Five Aprils written by Irene Hunt.  Jethro is a ten year old boy who's family is divided by the war with one brother going to fight for the Confederacy, while the others fight for the Union.  It is a great story full of insight and makes one think about how to deal with such differences.  Being a U. S. History teacher, and also a Civil War historian I find the film most useful in a classroom to support the novel.  It is a great story and the film sticks to the book.",988070400,,660,4.2063492063492065
