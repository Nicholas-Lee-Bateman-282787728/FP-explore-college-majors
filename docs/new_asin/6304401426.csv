859891,2,6304401426,"I first saw spectre when I was in the video store looking for a new horror movie to see....I've been watching horror movies for as long as I can remember and I love scary movies....I've seen so many, that Amazon has only a few listed that I haven't seen......I can definately say that this movie  suxx.....Poltergeist is my favorite movie of all time, and Spetre copies  it totally.....the begining is interesting and the only reason I give it 2  stars is that the parts that aren't of Poltergeist r very  original and extrememly awesome. But as the movie progresses, the more it  loses the originality it has and the more it looks like an Irish version of  Poltergeist. I don't know why it's priced as it is .....that's a ridiculous  price for this movie...and it's interesting to show to people.....I knew it  wouldn't be a good movie though when I first rented it, because it hadn't  been released in theaters, it went straight onto video. That's reason enoguh  not to buy it.",948672000,2,979,4.6395348837209305
859892,5,6304401426,"Me and my friends rented it two weekends in a row. Its soooo bad. The acting is awful, especially alexandra paul. She terrible, and every time she tries to use any sort of facial expression she goes overboard and its  hilarious. Also, the movie looked like it was over but then they added like  15 minutes of gratuitous sex. It was so funny. I would recommend this to  anybody who likes terrible movies.",948585600,4,403,4.493150684931507
859893,4,6304401426,"The story is basically Poltergeist with a twist of black magic and demonic possession.  There was some gore, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle.  Overall, I liked the plot and the characters.  However, it wasn't worth  the hefty price.",929491200,,241,4.95

7869673,5,6304401426,"I'm sort of confused on why this movie has two names. House of the Damned was what I thought it was. But anyway, as long as it's the right movie I was looking for. It was really hard to find this movie, and the only reason I found it was becuase I recognized the actress from Baywatch.

The DVD menu is pretty simple
1. Play the entire movie
2. Pick Scenes
3. Look at the original trailer

I haven't seen this movie since maybe I was 9 years old. I just remember being fascinated by a spirit of a girl name Colleen that communicated through a doll. Now that I'm 28, looking back on this for the VERY first time, yes, the special effects are very cheesy. I mean, it was made about 20 years ago. So, I'd cut it some slack. But even still, it had plenty of scary scenes.

I don't want to spoil it for anybody, but there was a particular scene that just had me constantly rewinding back toward that part. I just felt it was a really well done. It involved the father and a spiritual medium taking down an old wall, but I won't reveal what was behind it. But even as a child, I remember that very scene and it stayed in my head all these years. That one scene was the reason why I wanted to buy the movie.

I think there might have been a very small scene they cut out, but the story itself could have been better. It was a little weak. They could have showed how the family lived and what happened to them those few centuries back. They could have explained it better, or showed more flashbacks. What I did forget was that there were about three nudity/sex scenes. Just to warn you.

It's only $7 bucks, why not?",1433030400,,1608,4.141025641025641

7869675,4,6304401426,"Another one of Executive Producer Roger Corman's haunted house thrillers that he made in Ireland during the 90's (KNOCKING ON DEATH'S DOOR [1998] and THE HAUNTING OF HELL HOUSE [1999] are two others). Will South (Greg Evigan; DEEPSTAR SIX - 1989), wife Maura (Alexandra Paul; PREY OF THE CHAMELEON - 1991) and young daughter Ashley (portrayed by Evigan's real-life daughter Briana Evigan) move to Ireland when one of Maura's relatives dies and she inherits a huge mansion called Glen Abbey Manor. Will and Maura's marriage is strained due to Will having an affair back in the States, so they look at this move as a first step in repairing their relationship. What they don't know is that this house comes with a lot of supernatural baggage (In the beginning of the film, we witness a maid being attacked by rats and then killed when her car mysteriously blows up when she tries to escape the house). Almost immediately after the Souths move in, strange things begin to happen. Aubrey is drawn to one of the many bedrooms and finds a doll (which she calls Colleen) that talks to her. Will's videotape footage of their move is distorted and shows a mysterious aura surrounding Aubrey. Maura's nerves are shaken when something keeps moving the furniture in the blink of an eye. When Will and Maura are awakened by Aubrey's screams and discover a semi-transparent demon looming over Aubrey's bed, they hire parapsychologist Dr. Edward Shea (Dick Donaghue) and his assistant Amy Wolfe (Mary Kate Ryan) to come to the house and find out just what in the hell is going on. Dr. Shea discovers that a young girl named Colleen was murdered in the house and when a possessed Aubrey leads them to her body, which was hidden behind a brick wall in the basement, they give Colleen's body a proper burial in the town cemetery and believe their haunting problems are now over. Far from it. At dinner that night, all hell breaks loose. The turkey dinner takes on a life of it's own, Dr. Shea is decapitated when he runs outside and Aubrey ends up missing. Father Seamus (Eamon Draper) explains to Will and Maura the history of the house. The house is possessed by an evil force and has taken Aubrey to replace Colleen. Their only hope of getting her back is to perform an ancient religious ceremony and return an amulet to it's proper place that Will removed when they moved in. They manage to get their daughter back, but their problems are far from over. The evil now possesses Maura and it uses Maura's fears of Will's continued cheating to make her believe that Will is having an affair with Amy, which drives a wedge into an already unstable marriage. Will must find a way to snap Maura out of the supernatural hold she is under before she kills Aubrey or herself. A dead Father Seamus leaves Will the tools he needs to get the job done back at his church, but can Will make it back to the house in time?  While nothing but a low-budget rip-off of POLTERGEIST (1982) with a little bit of THE HAUNTING (1963) thrown in for good measure, SPECTRE (also known as HOUSE OF THE DAMNED) is a lot bloodier than the Tobe Hooper frightfest and even tosses in a lot of female nudity and a couple of good scares. Even though it's apparent that this was made for very little money, director Scott Levy (UNKNOWN ORIGIN - 1995; PIRANHA - 1995) manages to generate some truly suspenseful scenes and bloody set-pieces, including the opening scene of the maid perishing in her car; the dinner where the turkey being served becomes the aggressor; and the sequence where they find Colleen's body. The film does fall apart in the final third (the house fire that closes the film is as cheap and fake-looking as you'll ever see) and Brendan Broderick's screenplay does depend too much on haunted house clichs (disembodied moaning; objects flying through the air and crashing against the wall), but the beautiful Ireland location photography, nudity and bloodletting makes for a mildly diverting 83 minutes of supernatural thrills. The cast does well with what they're given to do and first-timer Briana Evigan is surprisingly good as a child under constant danger. She may have gotten the role because she was Greg Evigan's daughter, but she acquits herself nicely. Also starring Columba Heneghan, Helena Walsh, Marie Stafford and Adife O'Grady as Colleen. Not to be confused with Gene Roddenberry's SPECTRE (1977), one of his many failed 70's TV pilots, which, nevertheless was an entertaining film starring Robert Culp and Gig Young as occult investigators. Available on VHS & DVD from New Horizons Home Video. Rated R.",1430265600,,4587,4.7625628140703515

7869678,2,6304401426,Mediocre horror film.  Had potential to be a much better movie but fell short.  It's worth watching once but I doubt you will find yourself wanting to see it over and over.,1363564800,,172,4.34375
7869679,5,6304401426,"For those who have not seen this movie here is the plot. An American family moves into an old manor in Ireland. The home is haunted by the spirit of a young girl and other more malevolent ghosts. The films story itself is not entirely original. Without giving too much of the plot away, I will say there is a lot of disjointed pieces to the puzzle. With my reviews I try to focus on the release itself, rather than the overall merit of the film. The film is presented in full screen with a clear picture. The colors are a tad dark. This is a haunted house movie, so this is entirely forgivable. For bonus features the release offers very little: an original trailer.
The reason why I rated this film so high is its re-watchable value. I rented this film on VHS more than few times in my youth. I did not really like it then, but found myself returning to it. The same goes with it as a part of my DVD collection. I am happy I have it and watch it every now and then. There is something great about it which I can't really put my finger on.
Most folks I meet who have seen this movie know it by the title, House Of The Damned. It stars Alexandra Paul, who is always fun to see on screen (Check out John Carpenter's Christine, Love Thy Neighbor and Baywatch). I have also read that this films story bears a striking resemblance to the King Diamond record Abigail. I agree with that to a certain degree. As to what is in the cellar of the manor. Overall; A fun movie, cheap in cost and produced by Roger Corman. I put the trailer up on youtube under House Of The Damned/ Spectre if want to check it out. I bought the release here on Amazon and received it super fast from New Horizons. Thanks for reading.",1300147200,5,1702,4.192073170731708
