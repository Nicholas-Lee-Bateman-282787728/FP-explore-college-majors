2989112,2,B000WPJSX8,"This set of cartoons is billed as ""Bizarre"" , and while they probably can be thought of as bizarre, that doesn't make them ""Good"". I was not impressed.  I like cartoons of all kinds, old, new, feature films and short cartoons, you name it..., but this was barely average. I enjoyed one ( The Pincushion Man) out of the fifteen cartoons on this DVD. This set may be entertaining for young kids , but if you are looking for something creative and quirky from the past, there are better offerings than this.

2989125,3,B000WPJSX8,"Okay, I didn't pay eight bucks for this, I found it in a clearance bin for 3.99 and at that price it's a good buy if you just want these in your collection. On our big screen TV the images are frequently pixelated. It's clear that little to no effort was put into image restoration. I bought this for myself but to my surprise the kids are enjoying it too.

I don't know if these are all bizarre cartoons but the five year old keeps saying thoughtfully, ""That's weird..."". There's a general atmosphere across many cartoons from this era of a vague surrealism. Assembly lines throb, character movement is invariably rhythmic, and you can see where cartoonist R. Crumb got some of his inspiration. If you're used to the dreary predictability of Road Runner cartoons or the plot-oriented Scooby Doo stories, these may not be for you. Plot doesn't necessarily exist in this cartoon world and that means the animators can surprise you by going in almost any direction on a moment's notice.

Check it out on YouTube, it is indeed a very strange cartoon where the balloon people defeat the Pincushionman by pushing him off the edge of the flat earth. I have a strange suspicion that after one viewing you'll be ordering either this set or the Ub Iwerks DVD.
