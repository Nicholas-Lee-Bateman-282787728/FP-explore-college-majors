8163921,5,B000LSA8R6,Great information on how to not only treat ear infections but how to stimulate the immune system.,1429574400,,97,4.764705882352941
8163922,3,B000LSA8R6,I agree with the book's premise about antibiotics but the techniques mentioned in the book did not work for me.  It felt good mind yu but still no results.,1382659200,,155,4.344827586206897
8163923,5,B000LSA8R6,"There is a lot of good info on this dvd. As an adult I think the cause my earaches are related more to TMJ pain that is affecting my ears and that once that is resolved I will be feeling a lot better. Still it is very interesting to learn how conventional treatment of childhood earaches and/or infections has failed in many respects. I learned about the immune system, antibiotics, the lymphatic system and also there is some nutritional info that is valuable.",1304380800,3,461,4.566265060240964
8163924,4,B000LSA8R6,"I purchased the dvd after reading the book ""No More Amoxicilli by the same author.  The dvd help me administer the manipulations properly.  The diagrams in the book were not very good.  The book, however, was better at providing the information about using gentle manipulation rather than administering antibiotics for ear infections.  We have 20 month old twin boys.  One of the twins was on the second level antibiotics after three ear infections in less than two months.  He had several ear infections the previous year too.  We were also speaking to an ENT about putting tubes in his ears.  We use the techniques daily on our twin boys and they have not had another ear infection.  We also made other changes as recommended in the book such as adding supplements and probiotics to their diets, and we reduced dairy and wheat products.  The cost of the dvd is well worth it for our family.",1239580800,9,892,4.696774193548387
