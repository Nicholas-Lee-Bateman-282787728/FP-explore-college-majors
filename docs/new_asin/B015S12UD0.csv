8734408,3,B015S12UD0,"this is a decent horror film that was actually shown in u.s. theaters with english subtitles.  the geeks in charge of this release , chose not to release  this with english subtitles thereby taking away a huge worldwide audience.  I saw this in Denver , co and it  was a spooky film shot in native 3d.  We have four young ladies staying in a haunted house and the spirit of a dead woman is after them.  WILL SOMEONE PLEASE RELEASE THIS WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES?",1457827200,,459,4.404761904761905
