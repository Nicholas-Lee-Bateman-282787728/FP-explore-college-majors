I had no problem on my laptop, but the disk skipped and shuttered severly on three different relatively new DVD players. Amazon replaced what I thought was a defective disk only to be presented with the identical issues. So buyer beware on that possibility. Overall it was enjoyable if somewhat short IMO.

It traces the co-development of the Les Paul and the Stratocaster, with plenty of examples of the differing sounds and techniques available to players. Vintage guitar footage and photography combine with shots of players using instruments from the 50's on up.

3169256,5,B001795G3E,"""Solidbodies: The 50 Year Guitar War"" is an interesting documentary comparing the history and origins of two American icons, the Les Paul and the Stratocaster.  Without becoming extremely detailed, it gives the origins, background and philosophy of both the Fender and Gibson companies and how the Stratocaster and Les Paul came into being and the impact of both guitars on the history of rock music.  The documentary even touched on mistakes both companies made.  It also touched on the 80's when the ""hair bands"" were choosing other brands and Fender and Gibson lost a lot of market share. They mentioned, ""Kramer"" guitars which became number one in the 80's and then disappeared, only to have Gibson and Fender make a big resurgence.

The soundtrack features hot guitar playing that vividly illustrates the differences in the sounds of two rock music icons.  Even non-players will learn how many of the songs featuring guitar solos have been played on Stratocasters and Les Pauls.
