Then sit and laugh yourself silly.

Simply put: South Korea meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

This is one of the darkest black comedies to come along in a while.  It has the accidental disaster nature of Pulp Fiction, peppered with discord between two enforcers, which leads to a very funny scene where the pecking order between them is reestablished.

Add Lee Ji-hyeon (of La Belle or Korean title, Mi in), the absolute best actress in the world when it comes to droll deadpan, and it gets better and better

I will NOT put in spoilers here.  So you don't get a synopsis out of me.

You either like insane Korean humor, AND have a strong stomach for gore (not as gory as American gore BTW), which makes you a category one, or you're squeamish and don't find whacked out Korean humor funny.  If you're in category one, jump in and have a laugh or ten.  Category two?  Watch something else.

The ending is typically Korean in a delicious way, and fits the crime.

I absolutely refuse to put a morality tale spin on this commentary.

I love the flick, have watched it a lot of times, and will close by saying it is just plain bloody funny.",1198713600,,1236,4.479820627802691
