4338222,4,B004EPYZOY,"Drive Angry is a good Grindhouse flavored time that would have been great on a double bill with Dwayne Johnson's Faster back in the day. Machete could even be added for a classic Wood's, McVickers, or original Oriental Theatre in Chicago triple bill. Remakes of Pirahna, I Spit On Your Grave and others along with a ton of direct to dvd flicks have added to this trend. In other words, Hollywood is finally getting it several years after Rodriguez & Tarantino's Grindhouse opus. There's nothing wrong with silly, trashy, forgettable (unless you watch them repeatedly like me), over the top films that help you escape life's daily issues. Here, we have Nicholas Cage as an escapee from Hell who goes on a rampage in order to save his grandchild from a psychotic cult led by Billy Burke. With help from a feisty young woman with nothing to lose (Amber Heard), an old friend (David Morse), and ultimately, the mysterious Accountant (William Fichtner), our anti-hero mows down everything in his way with a variety of guns and other weapons. Wait until you see The God Killer in action. Drive Angry is a ridiculously violent and vulgar road trip that will leave you exhausted when it's over. I saw it in 3D and can't wait to own the dvd. If you're looking for fun, this is the rollercoaster ride for you. Ignore the prudes and others who knock this type of film. Sometimes, it's all about a good time with good refreshments. The Grindhouse experience is alive and well again and I hope it never goes away.",1298764800,,1500,4.664150943396226
4338223,4,B004EPYZOY,"Out of the last 3-4 movies Cage has made, this one is at the top! This is the type of movie that he is good at!
The movie has plenty of action... including, a couple of awesome muscle cars, some chill guns & some very, very good looking girls. Oh, not to mention, some fantastic/VERY COOL 3D effects!!!
This movie is one of the better 3D movies I have seen so far!

This movie reminds me of Dusk till Dawn in some ways, except Cage lacks the Coolness! that Clooney had in Dusk till Dawn.
It is FRESH, EXCITING, and appeals to all audiences(with the exception of children)...

It is not a Top Grade movie or Top Grade effort from Cage, but the totally HOT girl makes up for a lot of his lacking in performance...

Overall, I will give this movie a B, but recommend that you go & see it in 3D & in the theaters...
thanks...",1298678400,3,821,4.150943396226415
4338224,4,B004EPYZOY,"It seems as if ""film buffs"" are getting dumber and dumber nowadays. What are you guys wanting out of a movie called ""Drive Angry 3D"" and with Nic Cage??? Bergman??? I myself like a good, well written movie as much as anyone. But I like to pop a top and kick back and watch fun movies, and that's where Drive Angry 3D comes in. Definitely what I needed after a long day at work. This film has tonnes of cliches, is impossibly stupid and is over the top and trashy, but that was the point. I must say there was not a dull moment!!! There's tonnes of gore too- including Nic Cage walking around with a nasty looking shot eye for a good portion of the movie too. As for the 3D... well, if you've seen My Bloody Valentine 3D, Patrick Lussier's previous movie, you know what to expect- 3D gore, weapons flying in your face and this is no exception. There's crowbars, explosions, bullets, Cage pointing guns in your face, etc. This movie pulls a ton of punches, and you will just love it. As for the acting... let's face it, Nic was born for the action, tough guy roles. He is a total badass and it's just awesome to watch. William Fichter is class too, he is total suave and stylish fun to watch. Heard is sexy and is a great actress too.

Overall, if you can go in expecting total cheese, you will love this movie, and make no mistake, this is a total must see. I had a total blast, and I predict you will too!",1298678400,,1405,4.203703703703703
4338225,3,B004EPYZOY,"While one might think that B-grade grindhouse films may be all but extinct in this modern day and age, ""Drive Angry""  is a movie that unashamedly continues the tradition of parading gunfire, sex, explosions, fast cars, and satanic cults, and manages to do so in a way that makes it very entertaining for those who go in expecting such a spectacle.

""Drive Angry"" follows John Milton, a man who is going after a satanic cult, in order to rescue his granddaughter from their foul clutches, and prevent Hell from being unleashed on earth.  But it won't be easy, for despite all the firepower at his command, and the fast cars he drives, John is being followed by something evil...and not of this earth, that will stop at nothing to catch up with him.

""Drive Angry"" is a film content to relish it's violent, over the top heritage with lots of action and nudity (complete with naked, satanic hookers with machine guns).  While it won't win any awards, the film is a fun romp for B movie fans, especially with regards to Nicholas Cage and William Fichtner.  While Cage doesn't deviate too much from his usual subdued happy go lucky persona, he is fun to watch (especially when he seems to be doing his best, ""Terminator"" impression).  Alongside him, Fichtner is an absolute delight as the supernatural accountant, clearly having a blast every minute he's on screen, and bringing a wonderful, demonic delight to his part, perhaps making him the most enjoyable part of the film.

Overall, ""Drive Angry"" is much like 2007's, ""Grindhouse"" in that it will very likely cater to a very specific group of cinema fans, and will not appeal to many others.  But those who enjoy 70's style exploitation will find a lot to like here.",1298678400,,1715,4.709030100334449
4338226,3,B004EPYZOY,"Drive Angry has trashy B movie goodness all over it. You have your excessive gore, nudity, foul language and one laughable plot, but it all adds up to a pretty enjoyable flick. The story is beyond simplistic. A guy breaks out of hell and has to evade capture while searching for someone very important to him.

Nicolas Cage sure has had way more misses than hits in recent years (Bad Lieutenant and Kick-Ass being the standouts), but I liked his mellow approach to this character. You would think of all movies, this would be the one he would go overboard, but he wisely tones it down a few notches. Amber Heard plays the sidekick role, which she tries to inject with toughness. It didn't always work, but she adds a dose of energy and is quite the babe. Did I say she is hot? The standout by far is William Fichtner as hell's accountant. Basically he is the dude Satan sends out when someone manages to escape. You can tell he is having a great time and like Cage, he doesn't stray into the overacting category.

The 3-D was okay, but for a film that claims to be ""Shot in 3-D"" I wasn't that impressed. The CGI ranged from good to average, but for a movie like this, I didn't expect it to be polished.

If you liked Planet Terror, Death Proof or Piranha 3-D, you should have a blast with this one. It's cinemas equivalent to greasy fast food among the current Oscar nominated fillet minions.",1298592000,57,1392,4.408560311284047
4338227,4,B004EPYZOY,"Writer Todd Farmer and director Patrick Lussier really seemed to make the most of their partnership once they started working together. On their own, they brought us films like Jason X, Dracula 2000 and its sequels, and White Noise 2. Other than Jason X getting a pass from loyal horror and Friday the 13th fans, you don't really hear much about those other films. Drive Angry is technically only the second time Farmer and Lussier have collaborated with one another, but their first outing together was My Bloody Valentine which was actually a hell of a lot of fun. Not to mention the two horror buffs are currently attached to two projects that seem to have been in the works for ages; Halloween III and the Hellraiser reboot. So how would Drive Angry measure up to My Bloody Valentine? Would it be just as fun and would the 3D be utilized properly? How terrible would Nicolas Cage be? Turns out that if you're a fan of the previous work Farmer and Lussier have become associated with, you have nothing to worry about with Drive Angry.

How is it that every character in the main cast is a total badass? It's because of that that it's hard to dislike anyone in the film including Nicolas Cage. Cage seems a little dull at first. When he mutters the line, ""Tell him...I'm comin'!"" it sounds a bit stiff and it isn't clear what type of performance Cage is going to give. Milton is actually Cage's most entertaining role since Big Daddy. He makes it seem so natural to be so angry while also being this unstoppable vigilante that just broke out of hell. Amber Heard's Piper comes off like she has a bigger pair of balls than any man she comes in contact with. She isn't afraid to go toe-to-toe with anyone and she usually comes out on top. William Fichtner may be the most entertaining part of the cast. He's been sent by the big man downstairs to retrieve Milton and bring him back to hell. His quick wit combined with the tricks he pulls off with that coin he carries around and his practically endless arsenal of superhuman abilities cause all eyes to be glued to him whenever he walks on screen. Then there's Billy Burke whose Jonah King character is a satanic cult leader convinced that he can't be harmed by anything from this earth. Jonah is such a despicable character that you're practically rooting for his character to bite it by the time his wicked plan is about to come to fruition.

In addition to the film's cast, the writing is fairly entertaining as well. If you're familiar with anything Farmer or Lussier have done, you can pretty much expect events in the film to get a little outrageous or extremely outlandish at times. To tell the truth, that's half the charm of their films and what makes them so much fun. Does anyone else remember how people were saying that films like Crank or The Expendables were just kind of fun action films that you didn't have to think hard about? While that statement failed to register with me about those two films since I disliked both immensely, it fits extremely well with films by Farmer and Lussier except their films have a little more of a horror twist to them. The dialogue stood out at times, as well. There's a line Jonah spits out to Piper that went something like, ""I could shoot you in the throat right now and watch you gurgle while I eat my morning grapefruit..."" Some may consider that terrible, but the way Burke says it and the context it resides in really hit home with me. Cage also delivers a rather standout speech about how he had to watch his daughter suffer in hell while staring into a barrel of fire that is pretty memorable.

The humor in the film slides into the storyline fairly smoothly. Everything from sarcastic one-liners to a rather obese man taking a picture of a naked woman lying on the sidewalk with his cell phone will be sure to get a fair amount of laughs. The coffee scene with Nicolas Cage is just really hilarious. All of that over black coffee and sugar. Todd Farmer's Frank may get the most laughs and audience reaction though, especially once Fichtner's The Accountant shows up. Drive Angry is just able to effectively blend action, comedy, and horror into this exceptionally entertaining film that engrosses your attention from beginning to end.

Drive Angry is just ridiculous fun. It has an incredibly solid cast, an excessive amount of explosions and high octane car chases, and there's enough blood and T&A to satisfy the most deprived R-rated film enthusiasts. The 3D deserves to be mentioned, as well. Having shotgun shells, severed limbs, various amounts of debris, and a countless amount of bullets practically fall into your lap should be a good enough reason to see this film in theaters. Drive Angry actually being an extremely satisfying and extraordinary action film is just a bonus.",1298592000,52,4797,4.63337250293772

Nicolas Cage stars as the only man to escape hell, he does this to save his grandchild.  And to get the ""man"" that killed his daughter and her husband.  He'll stop at nothing.

He does meet a waitress and enlists her help and they start after the thugs that have his granddaughter.

4338325,3,B004EPYZOY,"The reviewer (Charles K. Orron November 5, 2016) who said ""Too bad to be good, or too good to be bad?"", said it best.  That was my exact thought about the movie when it wrapped up.

It's not my kind of movie, yet I watched it three times before returning it to the rental store.  (I'm the kind of person who usually only ever watches a movie once or twice ever with very few exceptions.)

The plot was actually quite compelling and drew me in.

William Fichtner's performance was stellar and his parts were a complete joy to watch.  The household agreed he deserved a Most Valuable Actor award for it.  (I'm not particularly a fan of his in general, but I'm not not a fan either.  I never really pay him much mind one way or another in his other work.)

Amber Heard's performance was also really good.

This was neither Nicholas Cage's worst performance, or his best.  Fans of his shouldn't be too disappointed, but it isn't one most would go bragging to their friends about either.  (Still, a vague reference of ""You gotta see this!"" may be uttered... just leaving out the part that he stars in it.)

This is an absolute MUST see for Billy Burke fans!  I had been beginning to think his performances were getting to be a bit one dimensional (not that I didn't still love watching him in them,) but now I'm seeing that when one is cast in the same exact cookie cutter roles, that's what you're going to get.  Billy's role as Jonah shows his range as an actor.  It was an amazing deviation from what I've been seeing in recent years.  (Mind you, I'm a bit late to the scene, as I've only recently become a fan of his.  He had never previously been in anything I had been interested in watching.  Now I'm sort of working my way backwards.)  He brought so much to this character and his dedication really shines through.

If you didn't absolutely hate the movie, watching it again with the bonus material on is worth a look.  Lots of neat info I didn't find in most of the interviews online.  The commentary is a must see,  the Pop Up Video type stuff is mostly car facts, and I found Milton's Mayhem utterly annoying - it was just a tally of his kills and injuries with annoying sound effects.  So, if you are a car buff I suggest play all, otherwise select just the commentary.",1501718400,,2276,4.3619047619047615

Overall, the special effects are really fun and the action is basically non-stop.

But one night I decided to check it out, as there wasn't much else on (not that I watch a lot of TV anyway.)  Keeping in mind that I have a ""strange"" sense of humor, this became my favorite movie.  If you're looking for some plausible drama like The DaVinci Code, this isn't for you.  If you can appreciate the humor of a guy escaping from Hell in a 1964 Buick Riviera, then this is the movie for you.  William Fichtner turns in a memorable performance as ""The Accountant,"" and in several parts of the movie reprises his role as an FBI agent from the series ""Prison Break.""

4339404,5,B004EPYZOY,"I love Drive Angry. Action movies aren't usually much my thing, much less ones that seem to sell themselves on the idea of cars being given title status, but this movie embodies everything I love in a popcorn flick: it's fun, it's over the top, and it plays with beloved tropes in new and inventive ways.
Drive Angry is no piece of high art, but that doesn't mean it is by any means artless. How many other films will let you watch an undead Nicolas Cage drink a beer out of his sworn enemy's skullcap while s*** talking an infernal accountant by comparing him to other pyschopomps? Drive Angry is lovingly constructed to be the best dumb supernatural car chase action movie it can be. And did I mention the lack of a forced romance subplot? Drive Angry's female lead has her own motivations and doesn't need to be turned into Cage's wilting arm candy to have a stake in the plot.
This is the kind of ""bad movie"" you dream of seeing, lovingly made by people who knew exactly what they were doing. If Drive Angry is trashy, then I am the raccoon greedily gobbling up that trash because it's just so good.",1440633600,8,1103,4.411764705882353

4339568,5,B004EPYZOY,"IF you are looking for action, attitude, and non stop blow s*** up.  This is the flick for you.  Yeah it lacks subtlety and reserve, but this movie runs like a bat out of hell.  Lots of gore, Lots of language, lots of CGI.  Great acting from great actors.  Sure its a bit slanted and offensive, but its a movie about a guy who escapes hell to rescue his baby granddaughter from being a satanic sacrifice.  Nuff said.  If you want violence, action, tits and ass. Smothered in foul language, explosions and muscle cars. This is the one. Drive Angry - Bad Ass!",1431043200,3,557,4.349514563106796

Milton meets up with a gal named Piper who is really pretty but can kick your ass, and the 2 take off in a Dodge Charger to rescue the baby girl from Satanists who are going to sacrifice the baby. The Accountant is not far behind. Milton drives angry, the Satanists drive crazy, the cops drive everywhere, & The Accountant is having a great time.

Have you ever seen a bad Nicolas Cage movie?  No imagine that movie in 3D!
This movie is filmed on par with Avatar to take advantage of 3D technologies and subtly deliver 3D movie goodness to viewers.
It's really a masterpiece.
There is gore but only ugly or overweight or ugly and overweight people die.
Lots of nuggets of greatness in this movie, like a beautiful pastry with some incredible filling.
If you are Marv Albert you will love this movie--see church scene. If you are into old cars or old chevy's, this movie will delight. The car scence are expertly shot in 3D.  If you love black coffee you will love this movie.  If you overbleached your hair and have dry split ends you will love this movie.  If you like guns, you will love this movie.  I And it has Amber Heard, who is not only the prettiest actress out there, she is actually really good.
The movie actually has a great script and is very well written.
Great actor performances and then there is Nicolas Cage.  I don't think there is no modern movie star more watchable on the big screen than Nicolas Cage, even if he obviously doesn't want to be there.
In all serious, this is a great movie and the writer,director, and Amber Heard should be doing more projects.

Also if you are Supreme Court Justice Anthony Scalia, you will not like this movie.",1423094400,5,1379,4.3843137254901965

It has some rather funny scenes and is enjoyable.  Two other actors made it in the movie.  I forget their names, but the ""bad guy"" in this movie plays Bella Swan's father in the Twilight series.  Very interesting seeing him be the villain after watching him in Forks, Washington.  Also, the captain of the NASA shuttle in Armageddon with Bruce Willis is in it.  At times he seems to be another villain, and at other times he seems to be helping our hero.  He flip-flops to his needs and he is too hilarious!  His character is one I really enjoyed watching.",1419984000,,728,4.2101449275362315
4339907,5,B004EPYZOY,"Ive never seen Nicolas Cage do a movie such as this! This is a peddle to the metal movie, pretty much from start to finish. Should young children who have seen R rated movies before see this move, the answer is, no way. The language, music, pictures, and settings, of which the move is shown, are in no way suitable for young children. This is my definition of a true rated R film. Was it a kick butt flick, oh yes! A hot chick, some cool cars, and revenge coursing through the main characters veins, seems to make for an interesting, if not highly amusing and entertaining film. Tuck your kids in, grab onto your popcorn, and make sure you fasten the seatbelt on your couch. Get ready for a movie ride you haven't had in quite some time.
  How can I sum up the move, see it. Would this have been cool to see in 3D in the movie theaters, yes it would! Am I happy to just own it on Blu-Ray in 2D, heck yeah.",1419292800,3,906,4.112994350282486

The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because: there is some mildly decent action, Amber Heard is hot, and there are lots of scenes with a sweet Dodge Challenger. Also Amber Heard's southern accent is horrible and not believable, but she is attractive so she gets a couple bonus points. This is how bad the movie is... I'm awarding points for the way an actress looks. Ugh.",1417651200,,550,4.622448979591836

Of course the devil doesn't like the idea of his escape from hell and sends one of his minion to fetch him back.

4340590,4,B004EPYZOY,"Drive Angry is the least successful 3D movie of all time as of its creation, and its gimmicky special effects combined with a puzzling narrative are the reasons why. The movie opens with Nicolas Cage escaping from Hell in a souped up car, with no explanation as to where he got the car. He emerges pretty much instantly into a gun battle in Colorado, because why not.

The movie is set in a universe that seems to have an impressively rich backstory, with a bureaucratic Hell with super-powered accountants and ""God guns,"" but it is a backstory that we are left in the dark about almost entirely. It's written like something based on a deep source material, like how a Star Wars movie assumes the audience knows a lot about jedi, lightsabers, etc, but the source material in Drive Angry doesn't actually exist anywhere outside of the movie itself.

While this makes the storyline in between the straight-forward (but 3d gimmick-heavy) action scenes incomprehensible at times, it also makes the movie very re-watchable, if only to try to puzzle out what exactly was going on. Between that, the spectacle of Nick Cage getting into a drunken, mid-sex gun fight with a bunch of marauders, and William Fichtner's almost impossibly cool portrayal of The Accountant, the movie is definitely worth seeing. The end also hints at a sequel, which sadly because of the movie's disastrous performance will undoubtedly never happen.",1397347200,2,1418,4.928870292887029

4340592,4,B004EPYZOY,"The thing about ""Drive Angry"" is that you cannot go in expecting a lot. This is not a masterpiece, this is a dirty, silly, campy little movie that celebrates Grindhouse and other B movies. If you happen to love that style of movies (I grew up on that genre) it's a fun movie. Sure it's kind of a bummer to watch Nicolas Cage scrapping the bottom of the barrel given the fact that he was once on of the finest actors of his generation but at least with ""Drive Angry"" you get the sense that he's at least in on the joke. Amber Heard, well she kind of serves her purpose as the pretty and snarky sidekick. She's serviceable but if this was a better movie she'd leave a lot to be desired. She's not the world's most gifted actress- let's put it that way.  Billy Burke is quiet a lot of fun as one of the baddies and William Fichtner as usual steals most of his scenes.

4340771,4,B004EPYZOY,"""Drive Angry"" (2011) is a cartoony thriller with supernatural elements
about a guy named Milton (Nicholas Cage) who escapes the underworld in
order to save his infant granddaughter who's been taken captive by a
band of satanists headed by Jonah King (Billy Burke). On Milton's trail
is a mysterious man called The Accountant (William Fichtner) and it's
unclear if he's friend or foe. Milton hooks up with an energetic young
woman, Piper (Amber Heard), and the chase is on.

This is an over-the-top action thriller to the max -- a comic book come
to life. It's meant to entertain and not to be taken seriously. It's
also really funny, like the fat slob who immediately takes out his cell
phone to take a picture of the half-naked brunette beaten-up by Piper.

Speaking of Heard, she's a little thin for my tastes but appealing
nevertheless and the filmmakers definitely take advantage of her
beauty, yet not in a crude way (although there are a couple of smutty
scenes featuring other women).

The characters are of the redneck trash variety, including the two
protagonists. I point this out because some might be turned off by
their unwholesomeness. Despite their gruff exterior, however, you start
to see their humanity, particularly as the story progresses. Milton's a
literal lost soul, but he goes all-out to save his baby granddaughter,
which is certainly Christ-like. Piper's not quite as lost, but she's
just a product of her spiritually-bereft environment. She's also
dynamic and bold, albeit foul. As the yarn unfolds these characters
connect in a father-daughter fashion and their love and respect near
the end is almost moving.

At the end of the day ""Drive Angry"" is about as forgettable as most
Syfy flicks, except that it has a much bigger budget and therefore a
slicker look. Regardless, it does its job; it entertains. It's similar
to the Ghost Rider movies, but without the supernatural overtness of
Ghost Rider, e.g. a flaming skeleton who rides a flame cycle, although
it has some of this, mostly at the climax.

The film was shot in Louisiana and runs 104 minutes.

4341025,2,B004EPYZOY,"DRIVE ANGRY (2011) is a hellish comic book-style movie (aimed at adolescent boys of all ages) that includes a netherworld ""hero"" named John Milton (get it?), lingering images of ghastly head wounds, totally nude women (one catfighting on the street has enormous...charms), overloud hip-hop and headbanger music, and a variety of classic muscle machines (Dodge Charger, Buick Rivera, Chevelle SS, etc.).

At times an endless car chase on back country roads and at others a lame attempt to gross out the viewer with splooshing gun and axe wounds, the story goes from one indignity to the next at a rapid pace. Dumbest moment has to be several thugs breaking in on a scowling Nick Cage while he's copulating with an unclothed blonde. They engage in a motel room shootout as a contortionate Cage never allows his coitus to be interruptus. When the enemies are all dead, Cage's ""date"" is left cringing in the corner in a state of near-dementia. Hahaha.

Upon reflection, a healthy touch of insanity (or masochism) is what's needed to sit through this thng.

To briefly describe DRIVE ANGRY's non-linear plot: after the leader of a devil-worshipping cult decapitates Cage's daughter and mounts her femur on the upper end of his walking stick, he steals the dead girl's newborn daughter. Cage, who's rotting in Hades for unspecified sins, escapes with a multi-barreled god-zapping rifle and goes on a quest to avenge his daughter's murder and get back his grandchild.

The Grim Reaper, in the form of an elegantly-suited ""Accountant,"" follows him to Earth and hunts down Cage and a young girl he's convinced to help with the rescue. Dozens of cars, a chemical truck and an RV are wrecked, explosions abound, and there's hamburger on the highway as bad music pounds like a migraine. We wade through all this to reach the grand finale at at abandoned Louisiana prison, where the cult leader plans to sacrifice the child to Satan on the next full moon, a midnight ceremony that features a fiery pentagram, grimy whirling dervishes and the requisite naked chicks, 40 followers in all. How can Nick possibly prevail against such daunting numbers? Hint: he's already... nevermind.....

Taking THAT into consideration, I noticed that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drive-Angry-Blu-Ray-Bilingual/dp/B004TN0RN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drive Angry Blu-Ray (Bilingual)</a>&nbsp;is available in 2-D; 3-D; DVD; Blu-Ray, and in
eleven (11!) different buying versions.

Reading reviews, I noted that MOST people liked the movie, but went on-and-on about ""F-bombs""; violence; and gratuitous nudity. I enjoyed the movie,
and noticed the 105-minutes flew by. The tongue-in-cheek humour entertained me just as much as the spectacularly --- impossible --- stunt driving.
Of course==========> Spoiler alert(till ""STOP!"") Nicolas Cage grows an eye back in a few minutes, and cannot die[again]==========> ""STOP!""

THIS is bargain-basement-priced entertainment. Now, lock the kids in the basement... and go to your MAN-cave and watch this popcorn-fest film!

***** My highest rating (all TEN fingers UP!) *****

I KNEW a lot of faces from movies over the years, but am hazzy about names. Here's the LISTED stars:

NICOLAS CAGE
AMBER HEARD
WILLIAM FICHTNER

Then things started to slide, the weird-er roles started popping up and had personally lost hope that his bad-assdom would fade. Drive Angry brings his gritty, ""I could give a s***"" attitude back to the silver screen.

And then you're like ""oh, I've seen this story before, but not like this, wow this is really cool.""

I was leery of the story after reading the DVD box, but it actually turned out to be an acceptable action hero flick, though a little off the established path... probably more in the 'Ghost Rider' genre than 'Con Air' type action character, but action enough and fast moving enough to keep me riveted to the screen for 2 hours!  Amber Heard is NOT your typical girly girl sidekick, she kicks a little butt on her own, and David Morse is a pleasant surprise in his typical supporting cast role here.  Another pleasant deviation from the norm is the 'not so bad' bad guy Hell's Accountant, humorously well played by William Fichtner... definitely enjoyed this one and will add it to the 'rotation' or repeat Saturday Night Movies.",1359244800,,787,4.654676258992806

Drive Angry has that kinda stuff in spades...sex and nudity (full frontal nudity in a couple of parts), language throughout, and definitely violence and gore and a bit of demonic stuff.

That being said though, if you can get past that like I can and enjoy the movie for what it is...a full throttle action thrill ride...then my friends, I encourage you to give this movie a watch.  This movie came off to me as a cross between Ghostrider and Constantine (2 movies I personally enjoy) with some Robert Rodgriguez thrown in (i.e. the language, gore, and nudity...it kind of seemed like his style).

I'm not going to go into detail about the plot or anything, because you can read that well enough for yourself on the product page, but it is an enjoyable and exciting ride...as long as, like I said, you can get around the language, gore, nudity, and demonic stuff.  If you liked Ghostrider and Constantine though and enjoy Robert Rodgriguez/Quentin Tarrentino films, then this movie should be right up your alley.

4341328,2,B004EPYZOY,"""If you kids don't shut up I am going to turn this car around and go home!""

Fine, see if we care. Drive Angry is not worth the time or money. It's just pure drivel with no idea of what direction its going in, setting up possible subplots and tangents and either killing them immediately or just abandoning them.

Nic Cage, on a career nosedive that would make Cuba Gooding Jnr. and Val Kilmer shriek, plays Milton (get it?) an outlaw on a confusing and boring quest for revenge against crazy cultists on the back roads of America's highways. A man in a suit known only as 'The Accountant' (William Fichtner, the ONLY reason for suffering this nonsense) is hot on his trail, keen to take him 'home'. Milton meets a stray girl, bangs a floozie, kills people, drives angry, and kills more. And I swear it is so boring you'll probably start reading a book before the credits end.

The car chases are so poorly done, the action so flatly staged, one has to wonder if Patrick Lussier was directing this inbetween afternoon naps. A very cheap, worthless film that is not worth keeping. If you insist on ridding yourself of your hard-earned dough...give it to the poor and needy.

The Blu-ray is in 3D 1.78:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. I was so bored-to-tears with this film I didn't even check if there were any extras.",1351728000,,1314,4.508403361344538

I work in brazil, and as there was nothing else on in english i had the privledge of watching this whole movie. ( which i would not suggest )  The effects were decent, and it did have action in it, but the dialog was nothing but horrible trash talk, and i think it was directed by a 12 year old.

Piper is a kick ass gal that cant hold her own against about anyone.  I'm glad to see that this 'new' car chase movie went back to the basics on most of the car chases, and left the CGI special effects craps to the other losers out there, yes 'Nick' I am referring to you.  I'd love to see the producers do a new twist on Vanishing Point, cause I kinda' feel like this is a new age Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, with a ton of attitude.  How could you not love a bar called 'The Bull by the Balls?'  11 out of 10 in my book.  Can't go wrong if you love car chase movies.",1350518400,,696,3.893617021276596

4341332,5,B004EPYZOY,"Nicolas Cage's best role, ever!  The normally deadpan and uneventful actor gets a chance to actually be pretty badass.
Cage plays John Milton, who broke out of Hell to rescue his baby granddaughter, who was kidnapped by the satanic cult that killed her parents.  Along the way he partners up with a jilted hottie named Piper (Amber Heard, 406 from Zombieland)and sets out on his quest with her help, as he has been in hell for a number of years and is unfamiliar with the world at large.
This movie is reminiscent of old school 70's style action movies, complete with badass cars and chase scenes.
WATCH THIS MOVIE in 3D, not 2D!! :)",1346716800,2,633,4.543859649122807
4341363,4,B004EPYZOY,"Some movies are suppose to be taken serious.  This is not one of them.  If you attend this movie, rent it, or watch it on late night T.V. do not expect a high brow film filled with human irony, Academy or Film Fest caliber acting or an ingenious plot with a star filled cast.  No, this film is simply silly fun which at times boarders on the tasteless.  It is the kind of movie you watch ""just because.""  The plot is quite simple.  Nicholas Cage plays...well, he sort of plays Nicholas Gage as a hardened and really, really bad guy who is dead but somehow escapes from Hell and steals a ""God Killer,"" which is a special gun capable of killing just about everything.  His mission is to stop and kill a crazed cult leader who has murdered his daughter and taken his grandchild in order to sacrifice the baby to meet his evil ends. He is tring to save his grand-daughter.  The `Accountant"" has been sent to bring him back.

Folks, from beginning to end there is almost not stop gratuitous and graphic violence; some shot well, others not so well. There is also almost nonstop car chases using very pretty classic muscle cars (Think Dukes of Hazard on steroids) which should fulfill the fantasy needs of the little Bubba in all of us.  There are a couple of rather vivid and remarkable sex scenes - one of which I have never seen the like before...Cage engages in a gun/saw/shovel/sledge hammer fight with about 6 or 8 guys all while having quite graphic and nonstop  sex while at the same time smoking a cigar and drinking from a bottle of whiskey.  You know, you just don't see all that many scenes like that these days.

I lost track of the body count in this film rather early on.  I lost track of how many ways Cage is able to kill off bad guys.  It was rather amazing.

The acting jobs; performances if you will, turned in by the entire cast were marginal at best with Cage included.  This film was not his shinning moment in front of the camera.  This is okay though, I really don't see how he could have done it any other way.  But as with everything, there are exceptions.  The actor William Fichtner (one of my favorite character actors) did a pretty darn good job as The Accountant.  He is Satan's minion sent back to haul Cage back.  He played his part with class and was the one person that added humor to the movie; twisted and quirky humor, I admit, but never-the-less humor.  Amber Heard did an acceptable job as the girl friend and is most certainly easy on the eyes.  The rest...well, to put it mildly....I have seen better.  Now keep in mind that unlike many, I am rather fond of Cage...I have liked most of his movies on one level or another.

Spoiler Alert:

There were a few scenes in this work that sort of stood out.  One was Cage drinking beer from the skull of the freshly killed bad guy.  I thought that added a perfect touch.  Of course there was the gun battle scene where Cage is ""making love"" while killing off quite a number of bubba-boy bad guys and never stopping once.  There is the scene where Amber beats up her abusive boy friend in a fist fight which Cage eventually finishes for her and there are a number of scenes featuring The Accountant which will give even the most jaded viewer at least a smirk or two.

Now don't let anyone feed you the line that the only reason they watched this movie was for the artistic and intellectual value involved.  Folks, there is none.  To make that claim is like the 18 year old telling you that the only reason he reads P. Boy magazine is so that he can read the intellectual articles.

No, every so often a person (anyway, I do) likes to watch show filled with mindless violence, improbably chase and fighting scenes and a hokey plot.  You really don't have to think while watching this one...only enjoy the mass destruction.

Note:  This is probably not the best first date movie a guy should choose and is not a movie you would want to take the wife, kids and grandma to see.

The plot is ridiculous, the action sequences are ridiculous, the villains are uber ridiculous, yet the extreme absurdity somehow evolved into something totally entertaining. At one point, Cage kills eight men while having sex. I thought only Chuck Noriss could pull that off. Drive Angry has all the makings of a cult classic...give it 5 to 10 years. Amber Heard stole the show as Piper; a mouthy, no-nonsense waitress blessed with a wicked right hook. Ms. Heard is a talented actress capable of tackling any character type, but a few more tough-chick roles like this could rank her as one of Hollywood's top female bad-asses. William Fichtner's role as Hell's snarky accountant is one of the more memorable and entertaining characters of the year.

4341371,4,B004EPYZOY,"I wasn't expecting much out of Drive Angry.  I expected it to be really bland to be honest.  Generic gun shooting action that I've been seeing in abundance for the last 30 years.  It's actually pretty good.

First of all *my God is Amber Heard amazingly attractive*.  I just HAD to get that off my chest!  What's more amazing is that she's the kind of woman who can radically change her appearance.  I've seen her in other movies and she looked like a very different woman.  She just has that ability to change the way she looks (and acts for that matter).

Anyway, before my hormones got sidetracked, I was going to mention what the story is about.  It's about a man with apparent invincibility powers played by Nicolas Cage and he's chasing after satanic cult members.  He's also running from another man with similar super powers hence the Matrix style slow-motion bullet blasting segments that are actually used to good effect this time.  I can't say the same concerning ALL movies.

The character of Amber Heard is that she's someone who actually has a filthy mouth so this is most certainly NOT a movie that children should be watching.  Way too many lines pertaining to sexual-related topics (especially in the beginning when we're first being introduced to the characters) and yeah, certainly not for kids.  Right from the beginning when she's working as a waitress in a diner you will quickly discover what she's like.  You won't like it.  She doesn't hold back *anything!*

The violence and suspense is really exaggerated but I honestly wouldn't want it any other way.  Whenever Nicolas Cage is cornered with a loaded gun, he blasts the bad guys apart in really creative, hard to believe blood-splashing ways.  The guy following Nicolas Cage has the same knack for extreme violence.  Watch what happens when the two clash!  You just gotta love it!

Overall, it's probably really cheesy but this is one of those examples where the cheesiness is overlooked because it features big name actors and actresses and the acting itself is really impressive and these features override the negatives by far.  I highly recommend it.  You can say it's an entertainingly violent good time!",1336694400,2,2186,4.827493261455525

I'm a HUGE Cage fan, and this is typical of what he's done the past many years now. Quirky, yet action films. He will not convert or lose any fans here. Now Amber Heard, she will be gaining many fans. Sexy is the only word that comes to mind. In this film she's a bit feisty too.

4341501,3,B004EPYZOY,"Even as I was watching this movie, I was having quite the time trying to process what I was seeing.  Without all the noisy distractions, the story is surprisingly basic, I've actually seen similar: good and bad.  The plot: a crazy cult leader kills the daughter of Milton (Nicolas Cage), kidnaps his infant granddaughter, AND plans to sacrifice the baby to herald in a new world order.  Seen it.  What makes this one a tad different is Milton is already dead and has to escape from hell in order to rescue his granddaughter.  Mayhem ensues, on a grand scale; it doesn't help that Nicolas also has to evade The Accountant (William Fichtner), sent by you-know-who, to capture and send Milton back to hell.  It's actually just a real long chase movie, a case of follow the crazy leader.  There are no real surprises along the way, a few shocks, a few bumps in the road, but nothing truly awe inspiring.  If you've seen one explosion.....really, there's only so much you can do with fire.  If you stripped the movie of all the garish violence, blood, and noise there'd be little left but a story that can be summed up in one sentence.  In other words, when things aren't exploding or people getting shot or run over, it's pretty dull: ordinary, sad, and not a little limp.  Cage obviously did it for the money and I hope he got paid up front because this was a huge box office bomb, not even the take from foreign markets could help recoup the cost.  (So don't expect a sequel.)
However, I did like some of it.  I was pleasantly surprised by William Fichtner's performance (usually a one note actor known for playing the same bad guy, repeatedly).  I thought he was hysterical.  Amber Heard was also good as Piper, someone Milton picks up along the way.  And it's always nice to see Tom Atkins in anything.  As for Nicolas Cage, it's hard to tell whether he purposely made Milton so low-key that he appeared comatose at times, or, dead, or he just wasn't trying because he felt the material was beneath him.  At any rate, I'm not sorry I watched it once, it was okay, I just can't see myself watching it again.",1328400000,,2106,4.497368421052632

4341615,5,B004EPYZOY,"I had absolutely no idea what the story line would be in this movie when I got it.  All I did know was that there were American muscle cars being driven fast and some shooting between cars going on, and since I was in the mood to be entertained, I just settled in and watched the movie.

What did I get?  One heck of a great time!  Okay, this flick earned it's R rating because there was plenty of foul language, nudity and gore, but I'm a big girl and I knew what I was expecting going in.

What I didn't expect was to laugh as much as I did, because while this movie was raunchy entertainment, it was also alot of fun.

Our angry driver, Milton, escapes from Hell when his daughter is murdered and his newborn granddaughter is kidnapped and slated for satanic sacrifice by the true villain in this movie.

Milton escaped from Hell with a very special weapon called 'the god killer' and he's determined to use it on anyone who gets between him and saving his granddaughter.  While he is trying to hunt down the jackhole who murdered his daughter and stole his granddaughter, he crosses paths with a waitress in a diner, Piper, who drives a fine car with a vanity plate that says DRVAGRY.

Now, Piper can talk trash and kick butt, a take care of herself at any cost kind of girl, the sort that are few and far between in most movies where the chicks are supposed to shed their clothes frequently and wait for the hero to rescue them at ever turn.

Not so for our Piper, who catches her boyfriend poppin' some other hoochie after having quit her gig at the greasy spoon where Milton runs into her.  After her engine conveniently craps out on the road so that Milton can help her out and beg a ride, he intervenes when Piper gets into it with her cheating old man after she lays fists on the chick her old man was bouncing on the mattress with.  Milton teaches him a few things about hitting women, even though Piper landed the first couple of punches, and they hit the road.

Hot on their heels is The Accountant, who is hilariously funny throughout the movie for his deadpan character and the way he manages to intervene on Milton's behalf while still trying to take him down and return him to Hell so that his 'balance sheet' is returned to normal.

There's brawling, F-bombs and lots of driving action that keeps this movie ripping along, and underneath all the in your face action there is a theme and some moments of poignancy that made this a far more well rounded entertainment experience than I ever expected going in.

This was a great movie for pure entertainment and diversion, with action, laughter and some basic truths about right, wrong and how it all works out in the end to balance out.

I had to say that in honor of The Accountant... ;)D",1321401600,,2755,4.383104125736739

4341619,3,B004EPYZOY,"Driving Angry is about a man names Milton who escapes hell to go hunting for a devil worshiping sect that killed his daughter and are panning to sacrifice his baby granddaughter. On his way Milton meets Piper a woman who definitely is not your average damsel in distress and get her to help in him his quest. The rest of the movie is basically insane car chases, gunfights, car chases with gunfights, sex and a race against time to save the little girl, avoid the hellish bounty hunter who are sent to take Milton back to hell and find the devil worshiping could and lay waste to it. This movie is what you get if you take Ghost Rider but make it far more edgy and violent than Marvel would ever allow.

I had allot of fun watching this movie. It is pure, mind nubbing action entertainment and nothing else, but sometimes a movie do not need to be more. The characters are all good. Milton is a typical Cage character, Piper is interesting, the leader of the devil worshiping cult is just such a jerk that you can not wait for him to get his just desert, and the Accountant, the man from hell sent to bring Milton back is mysterious and a hoot to watch. In short the characters work, you want the good guys to win and enjoy watching the bad guys get what they have coming. The special effects are all great and the car chases are inventive and fun to watch. I also loved the whole idea of hell as a prison with Satan as a warden, that is an interesting take on the whole concept of hell.

If I am going to have one complaint about this movie it would have to be the sex, there is allot of it and it at times very graphic. Now I am not a prude but this is not really necessary, it do not give me anything when the movie suddenly decides to turn into a porno. Yes I know they where going for violent and gritty, but we know what they are doing and how it works so please get done with the sex and get back to the plot, a movie do not get more dark or more gritty just because it have allot of graphic sex.

All in all Dive Angry is a decent film, is in mindless entertainment but it succeeds at that. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes supernatural action movies or just action film in general.

If you are lamenting having purchased this movie and then hating it, well that's what $1.00 rentals are for. Preview first. Secondly, if you are looking for an Oscar contender with superb acting, intense action and deep poignant script, what the heck are you doing getting a film by this director and writer?  If you know their work, you know what to expect. Once again, a little foreknowledge would have saved you the torture. If you object to the film on moral grounds, geez, the title and previews gave you no clue this might be a bit pissy? Get over it and go buy the sound of music.

This is a cheesy, schlocky, cut and paste, clich ridden, underacted, underwritten and low-bid special effects laden fun fest filled with exploitative T&A, violence, foul language and some pretty good 3D effects. And I am sorry, but William Fichtner was great in this film, funny and deadpan and very entertaining even with the bad script. And if you want to see Nick Cage at his best, look him up before he needed to make his back taxes. He was still entertaining in this film.

This film will never win any awards, not by a long shot. But it was fun to watch, entertaining in an over-the-top exploitative way.

4341681,4,B004EPYZOY,"I'll start off by saying that this movie is not for everyone. First, you need to have a tolerence for Nicholas Cage -- I don't mind the guy, but I know a lot of people can't stand him. If you're in this group, don't even bother with the movie.
This is also not a movie that you expect a reasonable plot from -- you need to be ""OK"" (and preferably enjoy) over the top movies that don't make sense at times.

If you're okay with that, you'll probably like Drive Angry.

My issue with the film itself is that it seemed to be going for a modern over-the-top exploitation/grindhouse type film (something like Planet Terror, the Crazy 88's scene in Kill Bill, or Machine Girl), but it just never reaches that level. Reading the amazon.com editorial review on the product page, it sounds like this is one of the most over-the-top films out there, filled with insane explosions, sex and violence throughout. There are parts in it that just fall flat or could have been so much better. Overall I'd give it about a 3.5/5 for the movie. If you're going to make a movie like that, you've gotta go ""all out"" as the storyline alone isn't going to win any awards. Would a ""toned down"" Planet Terror be as entertaining?

The 2-disc Blu-Ray 3D combo contains a 3D Blu-Ray (3D-only) with no extras and a Blu-Ray 2D with commentary, deleted scenes and more. Somewhat plain for a newer release, and I would have liked to see some more behind the scenes stuff than what's on it.

Both discs are in 1080p, 1.78:1 and have DTS-HD Master Audio which sounds great!

The 3D in this movie works well -- it was filmed natively in 3D (meaning it wasn't shot in 2D and converted) so it looks much more natural and shows more depth. I didn't find any ghosting in it, but I'm using a newer 3DTV (Panasonic DT30). Most of the movie uses depth - different layers seeming to go deep into the TV, but there are quite a few ""pop out"" scenes (including the usual gimmicks you're used to, like flipping a coin up towards the camera so it flies towards you). I thought these made the 3D presentation even more enjoyable, and it was nice to see them use a number of these throughout (opposed to just depth, and 1 or 2 popouts in the movie). The 2D presentation also looks very good, but if possible you'll want to watch it in 3D.",1316822400,8,2288,4.374117647058823
4341771,5,B004EPYZOY,"The last two or three movies that Cage has starred in(save Season of the Witch) have been pretty boring to me. My first thought was ""Great...another Nic Cage car movie. Woopdidoo"". Man, was I surprised when I popped this into my DVD player and watched it.

The story, itself, is about Milton. Milton breaks out of hell to rescue his infant granddaughter from a Satan-worshiping cult leader named Jonah King. Along the way, though, he encounters a woman named Piper who has a bad attitude yet has a good way about her and with a killer body. Then, there's the Accountant...this guy is out to get Milton and bring him back to Hell by any means necessary. Thing is, Milton always stays one step ahead of him. Still with me? Then, there's ton of car chases..gunfire...flying limbs...nudity...sex scenes...dry humor..alcohol..and that's not even getting it all.

My favorite scene, hate to admit, is the sex scene shootout. I cracked up seeing this woman Milton was with's reaction during and then after it all. Classic.

Needless to say, it's a high-octane film that harks back to the old B-films of the 70s. It doesn't take itself too seriously but that's what makes this movie so special. I love the movie. It's a heckuva lot of fun and, definitely, worth the ride.",1316736000,,1263,4.757990867579909
4341772,2,B004EPYZOY,"""Drive Angry"" has muscle cars, pretty 20 something aged women, a Satanic cult group, state trooper road blocks, fancy weapons, and lots of shooting guns at people with the intent to kill.  There is a lot of vulgar language, lots of gratuitous female nudity, lots of violence, and Nicolas Cage portrays a guy who comes back from the dead, well hell actually, and interacts with still living humans - in particular, the devil worshiping cult leader who killed his daughter, and intends upon sacrificing his granddaughter.  The character portrayed by Nicolas Cage doesn't seem to have much for special powers, but the agent from hell who calls himself the accountant, has all kinds of god-like powers.  The accountant is played by the actor William Fichtner.  William Fichtner has been in ""Equillibrium,"" the TV series ""The West Wing,"" ""Black Hawk Down,"" ""Switchback,"" ""Armageddon,"" and ""Crash.""  Christa Campbell, Katy Mixon, and Charlotte Ross present themselves to us wearing the pajamas God gave them during the film, and Amber Heard just demonstrates her potty mouth.  There is a lot of f-bomb talk, and some 1970's style far away camera shots of older women (of less model quality) that dance around at a campfire party in the nude, but the camera isn't kept still and focused enough to be sure they are actually real women instead of manikins from a clothing store.  Amber Heard doesn't show much skin, and seems oblivious to reality or danger.  David Morse (the dad from ""Contact"") appears as an ally late in the film and basically is just a familiar face to give the movie more star power.  The movie has some interesting parts to it, and good looking women in the buff, however, somehow, this movie falls short of staying in one track.  It doesn't really make Nicolas Cage's character un-kill-able, and the viewer is expected to be okay with waffling between the believable and the insanity-level unbelievability of supernatural elements now and then.  There are several hot women going buff, however Amber Heard seems like she is trying to convince us she has enough acting ability she doesn't need to participate in the skin fest (I'm definitely not convinced). The one hour and forty five minutes movie never gets off the ground and could have been ten times better with somebody else besides Nicolas Cage in the lead role.  The mystery and powers of William Fichtner as the accountant are a much stronger element of this film than Cage's performance.  Billy Burke gives us a 1970's documentary type performance as the cult leader, and could have had a lot more substance to his acting.  The story has potential, but needs some replacements in the casting, as well as a bit better writing to make it less cheesy and less juvenile audience geared for the small genitalia crowd who pseudo-compensate their self-image by the kind of car (or 4-wheel drive pickup) they drive.  Nicolas Cage needs to find a different career, and I wish I had his marketing agent.",1316736000,2,2967,4.894211576846307

4341780,2,B004EPYZOY,"DRIVE ANGRY (2011) is a hellish comic book-style movie (aimed at adolescent boys of all ages) that includes a netherworld ""hero""  named John Milton (get it?), lingering images of ghastly head wounds, totally nude women (one catfighting on the street has enormous...charms), overloud hip-hop and headbanger music, and a variety of classic muscle machines (Dodge Charger, Buick Rivera, Chevelle SS, etc.).

At times an endless car chase on back country roads and at others a lame attempt to gross out the viewer with splooshing gun and axe wounds, the story goes from one indignity to the next at a rapid pace. Dumbest moment has to be several thugs breaking in on a scowling Nick Cage while he's copulating with an unclothed blonde. They engage in a motel room shootout as a contortionate Cage never allows his coitus to be interruptus. When the enemies are all dead, Cage's ""date"" is left cringing in the corner in a state of near-dementia. Hahaha.

Upon reflection, a healthy touch of insanity (or masochism) is what's needed to sit through this thng.

To briefly describe DRIVE ANGRY's non-linear plot: after the leader of a devil-worshipping cult decapitates Cage's daughter and mounts her femur on the upper end of his walking stick, he steals the dead girl's newborn daughter. Cage, who's rotting in Hades for unspecified sins, escapes with a multi-barreled god-zapping rifle and goes on a quest to avenge his daughter's murder and get back his grandchild.

The Grim Reaper, in the form of an elegantly-suited ""Accountant,"" follows him to Earth and hunts down Cage and a young girl he's convinced to help with the rescue. Dozens of cars, a chemical truck and an RV are wrecked, explosions abound, and there's hamburger on the highway as bad music pounds like a migraine. We wade through all this to reach the grand finale at at abandoned Louisiana prison, where the cult leader plans to sacrifice the child to Satan on the next full moon, a midnight ceremony that features a fiery pentagram, grimy whirling dervishes and the requisite naked chicks, 40 followers in all. How can Nick possibly prevail against such daunting numbers? Hint: he's already... nevermind.....

4341824,5,B004EPYZOY,"This is a fun film where the morals are very highly delineated, and the sense of purpose is very clear. As one amazing morality play, it fits perfectly in a corrupt world, and in a world where film makers are made to adhere to an arbitrary code, Lussier and Cage, collaborate to make a film of mythic proportions. For those stuck on issues about the F bomb, please note that Milton never swears once during the entire film. He has a pure sense of purpose with a not so pure method ( now where in real life have we heard those points before ???? :-)... mmm, well, just about every war in  at least the last 20 years). The film is made to entertain however, the modern films are the worlds mythology. This realm is where in one scene Milton promises to drink out of Frank's skull, and achieves that in the end scenes. The sense of dramatic come-uppance that the bad guys get is very tangible, as is the surreal way it is delivered. After all, this is not reality, this is escapism. Watch this film without some preconceptions, and you might see the massive mythic component, and one has to do with the sacrifice of the baby ... check out what satan's minions ( Milton and the accountant) have to say about the Cult's viewpoint.

4341825,3,B004EPYZOY,"""Drive Angry"" stars Nicholas Cage as one ""Milton"" hell-bent on revenge, trying to retrieve his granddaughter from a cult religious leader Jonah King (Billy Burke), who abducted her after murdering Milton's daughter. But don't take the film's subject matter too seriously as a grindhouse-type action movie is full of tongue-in-cheek moments, like our hero's ridiculously over-the-top dialogues and borderline silly shootouts. In a motel room Milton is seen gunning down the henchmen - while having a sex with a lady.

It's a bad taste, and ""Drive Angry"" is supposed to be that way. The story doesn't make much sense - we don't exactly know how Milton (John?) escaped from the hell, or why an ""FBI"" agent (actually ""The Accountant"") played by scenery-chewing, scene-stealing William Fichtner has to chase him. It's all about guns, gores and cars, especially muscle cars. Director Patrick Lussier's use of 3D techniques is also old-fashioned. You don't get the subtlety of the visual world of ""Avatar."" In ""Drive Angry"" objects will be flying at you even when they don't need to.

Patrick Lussier (following his ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"") knows what he is doing, but compared with other recent examples of films inspired by the campy 1970s exploitation movies (like ""Machete""), the level of violence seems tame, for better or worse. Also, the film stars Amber Heard and David Morse, but Morse's role is disappointingly small. Perhaps directors like Rodriguez or Tarantino would have given him more to do.

Except that DRIVE ANGRY's outlandish premise is sure-fire bait for cats like me. Nicolas Cage plays ""John Milton"" - and how many of you caught that bit of literature? - an undead fugitive what broke out of Hell to avenge his daughter's murder and to save his captive baby grand-child from a Satanic cult. Milton tears thru mythical places such as Laughter, Colorado and Still Water Marsh, Louisiana and, uh, Oklahoma, as he relentlessly tracks the demented cult leader Jonah King (Billy Burke). Along the way Milton gains the help of the lovely, two-fisted waitress Piper (Amber Heard), and there they go, tearing off in Piper's wicked 1969 Dodge Charger 440, hellbent for justice, B-movie grindhouse style. But Milton and Piper are racing against the clock. Once the full moon hovers high, Milton's grand-child will be sacrificed in a demonic ritual intended to bring about - and this can only be said in caps - THE END OF THE WORLD (world world world...).

Meantime, the demonic Accountant (William Fichtner, all unflappable), the Devil's top repo agent, has been deployed to retrieve Milton, drag the taciturn sucker back to Tartarus, preferably kicking and screaming. The Accountant, with his quirks and that insouciant gleam in his eye, is instantly my favorite character in this film. Nicolas Cage would've done well to have generated a like gleam in his eye. He settles for a bullet hole in the eyeball. Not the same.

Thru all the over-the-top splatterfest and the gratuitous nudity and the rampant f-bombs you can almost feel director Patrick Lussier blatantly not apologizing. He set out to make a riproaring, wildly violent grindhouse flick and damnation if he didn't get away with it. Somewhere, Quentin Tarantino just stained his pants. DRIVE ANGRY is essentially one long chase scene which occasionally detours into Shootemupville and Boobytown. Amber Heard instantly makes an impression, with her hot bod and take-no-guff-from-anyone attitude. Nicolas Cage plays it cool but detached which is de rigueur for Cage when starring in most of his action flicks. But a Nick Cage who's sold out is still pretty watchable. No one else can quite be as indifferently cool. DRIVE ANGRY wrests four stars out of five from me, based some on Cage's effort, some on Fichtner's attention grabbing performance, and on Amber Heard's fight, and on the film's excesses and nutty attitude and sheer chutzpah. This is a fun movie. But, then again, I'm the kinda guy who'd rather watch DRIVE ANGRY over LEAVING LAS VEGAS any day, any time. DRIVE ANGRY doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is: a slice of awesome supernatural action-packed B-movie shlock with nice bits of nudity.

I'm a Nicholas Cage fan and despite very solid performances by Nicholas Cage, Amber Head, and William Fichtner, they could not save a bad script and horrible direction.

I think this movie is a great example of having a good idea but being unable to execute effectively.

The premise and plot are very interesting however the script was not cohesive and the direction could not quite find the right balance between being bad ass over the top and being grounded enough to connect us to the characters.

Some parts of the movie come off as cartoonish, some as if it should be on Jack Ass, some as if it should be on Airplane...  basically the movie is just a giant mess.

But even with all that, I think the actors did a phenonmenal job.  So IMO, its just not their fault, but rather a bad script and horrible direction.

This film has our main protaganist actually escaping from Hades to exact revenge against a Jim Jones wanna be who murdered his wife and is sacrificing his baby daughter at a full moon ceremony.  Introduce a hot babe into the mix who can hold her own and a satanic character labeled the 'accountant' who wants to get our hero back to hell before Satan finds out and you have the gist of Director Patrick Lussier's 'DRIVE ANGRY', an entertaining hell ride of an action movie.  Nicholas Cage persists in acting in some wild genre titles and is perfect for this role , gorgeous Amber Heard is our mortal waitress who aids Cage and Billy Burke giving the villainy a great upgrade.  William Fichtner as the 'accountant' steals the film and 80's B-movie stalwart Tom Atkins returns in a great cameo.  The usual fight / car chase / incendiary explosions titillate the senses with Michael Wandmacher's excellent electric guitar score aiding the rush.  After all the high octane action movie rushes released this year, 'DRIVE ANGRY' (its the name on the license plate of Amber's car) seems fresh and timeless. Summit Entertainment releases it in a beautiful 1.85 Dolby Digital 5.1 transfer making you not miss the lack of 3D imagery with audio commentary by Director Lussier and Screenwriter/Actor Todd Farmer and Deleted Scenes, a collage of Nicholas Cage mayhem and featurette on the making of the film.

4341880,4,B004EPYZOY,"Not intended for the timid artistic souls amongst us.

Falling into and under the ""grindhouse"" genre of filmmaking, this is the best of Saturday-Night-At-The-Drive-In homage: Naked women, extreme bloody violence and outrageous storytelling. I remember this period of movies well and have very fond memories of places that today exist only in historical images and in the hearts of wistful times long gone. These action/thrillers and ubiquitous kung-fu flicks were the dominant form of cheap entertainment from the late 1960s through the early 1980s when home video cassettes were introduced into the marketplace, thus killing the popular weekend gatherings. It's actually quite sad. I can recall families and friends who would meet up at the drive-in, bringing their potluck foodstuffs, kids all running around, having a blast as a community at the drive-in; now we're separated by byte and HD home set-ups. (apologies for the misty tangent)

It's interesting how much more enjoyable Cage can be when he actually acts, and by that I mean, when he stops acting like himself. Because his real personality is so much less enjoyable, less interesting and infinitely more lame. Pompous overbearing fool would be a step up if you've ever encountered the man. So I really enjoy the times when he's able to put aside his real-life persona in favor of a movie character. And playing Milton (obvious nod to 'Paradise Lost' author of the same moniker) has Cage at his best - his real self is completely gone and replaced by a seriously focused deceased dude on a hellbent mission.

Shotgun blast of pure adrenaline with Amber Heard portraying kick-ass temptress Piper, lending her ample assets to help Milton save his granddaughter from a demented cult. Her performance is spot-on perfect. With just enough trailer trash, just enough action, just enough hot pants, and just enough modern fully-realized hip chick to pull off her role with supreme skill. Impressed with this young actress; it'll be interesting to see what she does next.

And Hell hath no fury like The Accountant; the Devil's own bean-counter who doesn't take it well when one of the beans jumps out of the pot. Deliciously played by William Fichtner, who does the dry humorless soul cruncher with wicked fun. Been a fan of the man for many years going back to both the small and big screen. He's a consummate actor of range who always seems to be on the verge of breaking into big screen leading man roles, but unfortunately might be too gothic to pull off the all important romantic lead. Which is just as well, I'm fond of his cool calculating characters.

Loved the extreme explosions, outstanding muscle car chases and the over-the-top brutal violence. And, no, bodies hit with .45 caliber rounds do not 'fly' off their feet and out of windows. (laughing) But that's the point. Outlandish outrageousness is the theme of this grindhouse.

Strangely enough, I found the story deeper, richer and more complex than so-called ""serious"" films of today. There's a genuine energy born from movie makers like Director Patrick Lussier, an energy that eludes many cerebral arthouse productions. It seems we're stuck with an entire generation of navel-studying writers and directors who, collectively, seem to believe that having people aimlessly vomit lines from a mundane script, then shooting that screenplay with unsteady high-contrast video somehow constitutes drama. An example of this was the highly touted '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sideways/dp/B0007TKOAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sideways</a>' - which epitomizes pretentious dung heap filmmaking.

4341971,5,B004EPYZOY,"I thought this movie was a lot of fun.  The cover failed to convey what the movie was about.  A front view of a black charger with Nick and Amber in it with hell in the background would have been clearer to me but I am a graphic artist by trade so I have to put in my two cents.  Again, this was not what I expected but the concept (spoiler) of Nick Cage as an escaped damned soul stealing a magic gun from hell and escaping to save his daughter from a crazy cultist who would sacrifice his only daughter is great.  William Fichtner as the devil tracker (The Accountant) was amazing, I will never look at the song ""That's the way I like it"" by K.C. and the Sunshine band again.  Also the ""Doing it"" and ""Doing people with a gun"" scene was great, I never saw a scene like that before.  I do wish Amber's role was more integrated with the story and not in the sexist roles you see for women: the babe, the bate, the mother.  Personally I wish she was the actual mother from heaven, coming to help.  I guess that would change the story quite a bit and leave the child parentless unless David Morse's character lived and took the child but I think he would make a nice dad character.  He played a caring soul.  Of everyone I thought William Fichtner's role was the best.  Every second he was on the screen he did something funny, crazy or both.  I laughed so hard it hurt.  Personally I thought he was the star of the show and very well cast.  He did so much with the role.",1310860800,2,1469,4.126760563380282

4341979,5,B004EPYZOY,"I don't know about anyone else, but when I sit down to watch a Nic Cage film, I'm usually going to watch one of his bad movies. Why? Because they're hilarious, and this movie is no exception. The special effects are just laughable, and you can spot the green screen a lot of the time. The acting is atrociously bad. Terrifically bad, or terribad as I say.

By now you must be wondering why I rated this movie 5 stars, after dissing everything about it. All of these terrible elements of the movie come out and make the movie not an action movie, but a comedy of sorts.

The lines read by the actors are hilarious. The first time I watched this movie, my friends and I were cracking puns about something that was said every minute or so. We were laughing so hard that we couldn't breath, and tears were coming out of our eyes. Not to mention, as I said earlier, the special effects are literally laughable. These effects would have been acceptable in the 90's, but today they're just hilarious.

Seriously, if you're going into this movie expecting to get an Academy Awards level movie, you're at the wrong place, don't buy this. If you go into this movie with an open mind, and expecting it to be so bad that it's funny, then you will enjoy yourself immensely. I mean come on, he drinks beer from the guys skull at the end, and kills a room full of people while straddling a woman. From the moment he comes on screen with those ridiculous Oakley's you will be laughing.

This is Nic Cage people. What do you expect? Either you love him or you hate him. The number of good movies he's had can be counted on your fingers.

Piper (Amber Heard) is the coolest and most kick-as carecter I`ve seen in years, and becouse of that I`m a fan of Amber now, and the funny thing is that she is the most normal one of them all.
Mason (Nic Cage) is a verry bad man who have died and gone to Hell. Enough said. Now Nic, he delivers a good preformance as allways.

4342052,5,B004EPYZOY,"If you want to make a pretentious person frustrated, tell them that your favorite actor is Nic Cage.  It is very hard for people who care about what others think of them to enjoy a Nicoloas Cage movie mainly because Cage clearly is the opposite of them; it is obvious that the Oscar-winner really doesn't give a flying-flip what you or any other critic thinks.

""Drive Angry"" is the best movie I've seen so far in 2011 (I'm seeing ""Tree of Life"" tomorrow, maybe that will change).  On that point, it is the most entertained I've been at a theater since late 2007 when I watched ""No Country for Old Men"".  Now, if you're a moron that can only think in binary terms, you are probably thinking, ""How can this guy compare those two?!"" or, ""How is this guy who enjoyed this piece of junk going to enjoy 'Tree of Life'"".  Well, let me explain: my tastes are not defined by my pathetic need to be seen as ""cultured"" or ""intelligent"" by others.

""Drive Angry"" has everything good action movies should have.  Lots of explosions, car chases, terribly graphic violence, naked chicks, guns, guns, guns, and a satanic cult.  NO, I'm not comparing it to ""Terminator 2"", but alot of the leather-clad butt-rockiness of this movie gave off the same aura as that classic.  Also, the story is incredibly original, unless you can tell me about another movie where a dude escapes from hell to rescue his granddaughter from a satanic cult whilst dodging Satan's reconnaissance agent.  Cage is awesome just for being Cage, but I also enjoyed William Fichtner's role as The Accountant.

Briefly, I also want to say how grateful I am that this movie is rated R.  Too many movies today are rated PG-13, thereby leaving out the bullets to heads, f-bombs, and gratuitous nudity that keep annoying families out of theaters.

What I really don't understand is how so many people will drool all over Tarantino flick's that seek to emulate trashy cinema and then not enjoy the real deal.  Accept no substitue, ""Drive Angry"" is the real modern grindhouse flick.  It is a movie too busy being awesome to think, and it really doesn't care what your film school boyfriend thinks.

Actually, I do understand why somebody would like a Tarantino rip off of trashy cinema but not like this; because this movie doesn't have Tarantino's name on it.  And people are so dumb that somebodies name being on something will immediately make them rate it higher than it really should be.  Did people actually enjoy ""Inglorious Basterds""?  They wouldn't if it hadn't of had Tarantino's name on it.

4342053,5,B004EPYZOY,"A lot of bad reviews of this movie are coming from people saying they are big Nic Cage fans and can't believe he did a movie like this. Well first, are they fans of Nic Cage in Raising Arizona and City of Angels, or fans of Nic Cage in Kick Ass and Bangkok Dangerous. Mr. Cage is a very versatile actor, so ruling him out of making any particular style of movie is discrediting his versatility. Second, if you're not a fan of over the top action movies, why on earth would you go to see a movie called Drive Angry that clearly showed in the previews that it was an over the top action movie. Now that I've addressed the issues I have with the negative reviews, on to my positive review! This movie was awesome. It had everything a good action flick should have: Action, Sex, Nudity, Blood, Foul Language... and then to top it off, it had all 5 of those AT THE SAME TIME. The acting was good all around, and I never felt like anyone was out of place. It was an extremely fun to watch movie from start to finish, and when it was over, I felt very satisfied with the overall story. The soundtrack was also awesome, and went very well with all of the action. It didn't have 300m dollar special effects, but they were good enough to propel the story. Anyone who is a fan of Shoot Em Up, Kick Ass, Expendables, Crank or any other good extreme action flick, will definitely not be disappointed by this film.

The acting in this film is TERRIBLE. Especially the girl riding around with Nic Cage. I guess they cast her cus she was good looking cus her acting is awful. I think Nic Cage is a pretty good actor. But I don't know what he is thinking when he takes the scripts he agrees to do. For the most part most of his movies are bad. But this is beyond bad! Its easy to see why this movie flopped. Watching it on Blu ray, you could really tell how rushed and low budget this movie was. My son walked in the room and looked at the screen and asked why I didn't get the Blu-ray copy of this. I had to tell him it was the blu-ray copy. It was almost like watching a SYFY original movie in terms of video quality. I'm glad I rented from a redbox and only paid a dollar for it. Opening scene was promising, everything beyond that is awful!!!! Hilariously bad screeching rock music when Nic Cage steps out of the car.

No, Bret, it's not Dr. Zhivago.  But a lurid B-movie?  Please.  This is the second film Cage has made that involves the mythology of Hell and the Devil, the first being Ghost Rider.  You have to buy into that hypothesis at the beginning.  It has more cursing, nudity and gory violence than I've ever seen in a Cage film.  It's no family movie.  That said it gets your attention and holds it all the way through.  The acting is mostly grownup and the directing is fair.  It has no drawn-out boring parts.  It is entertainment.

The story is bare bones though, and nothing to get excited about, but the pacing and action deliver a decent experience with some neat moments. The driving, for all of Nic Cage's supposed skill behind the wheel, is only average at best thanks mostly due to its slower pace.

The 3D is the real star here, and is executed as well as one could hope. The 3D stands out, so the foreground, mid and background pop out from each other, creating a very convincing illusion of depth.

I watch 3D on a 120"" screen with an Acer H5360 projector (using an Optoma 3D-XL 3D adapter).  3D on this system is much better than your regular TV.  I thought this was very well done 3D. Most of the time it gives the movie extra depth, with just the right number of moments of shoving stuff in your face.  You can really tell the quality difference over converted movies.  One very cool 3D effect was the close up of the moon.
As a Christian I really don't have a problem with the plot.  Do bad things and you pay for it in the end. The violence was silly enough that if it hadn't been for the sex scenes I would let my teenage kids watch.  I really wouldn't have missed the sex scenes either.

4342235,3,B004EPYZOY,"Mainstream cinematic trash-fests aren't often as fun as Drive Angry, brought to us by the same crew behind the 3-D remake of My Bloody Valentine.  Nicolas Cage stars as Milton, a man who has come back from Hell to avenge the death of his daughter and save the life of her baby, who is set to be sacrificed by a Satanic cult leader (Billy Burke).  Along for the ride is a tough waitress (Amber Heard) and on their trail is the mysterious Accountant (William Fichtner), whose determined to bring Milton back where he belongs.  Though it's over the top and barely makes a lick of sense, Drive Angry succeeds thanks to the fact that the cast manages to perform so admirably that it's almost shocking.  Fichtner especially plays his role with such zeal and scene-chewing menace that his performance is worth the price of admission alone.  Well, that and the fact that Amber Heard is spectacular eye-candy, but I digress.  Though it begins to fall apart by it's final act, Drive Angry is enjoyable for the most part, as long as you leave your brain and sensibilities at the door.",1307404800,,1073,4.621052631578947
4342236,2,B004EPYZOY,"Nic Cage's career has been one heck of a roller-coaster ride. From highs so high, you'd think he was worthy of a place among Hollywood's leading men legends, to lows so low, that you wonder if his agent is out to sabotage him to never working in film again, his film credits have run the gamut. In the grand scheme of all that, ""Drive Angry,"" while not the lowest point he's ever hit, certainly is on that end of the dividing line.

Cage plays a man named Milton, who's come back from the depths of Hell, to revenge his daughter's murder and grand-daughter's kidnapping at the hands of Jonah King (played by Billy Burke) and his devil cult. All while picking up a sexy sidekick (played by Amber Heard) and dodging a hell-born truant officer (played by William Fichtner).

If that plot sounds completely preposterous, that's only because it is. The film is on the level of a low-budget grindhouse affair, but is lacking in the true grit and feeling of sleaziness that a true one would have. Cage spends the entire film with the same expression on his face, whether he's blowing people away, talking about his love for his daughter, or getting it on with a cheap floozy. Meanwhile, Billy Burke's character is simply evil incarnate, without a single redeeming factor or any complexity of any kind. He doesn't just lack depth of character, but shallowness of character. Amber Heard is simply some very sexy arm candy for Cage, as the plot shows her to be little more than the perpetual damsel in distress, even when she's trying to kick some ass herself. The only one to bring anything of value to this proceeding, is William Fichtner as the hellspawn retriever known as ""the Accountant."" His deadpan expressions and flippant remarks make up most of the humor to be found (which isn't much) in this action-paced mess.

Co-Writer/Director Patrick Lussier, who's resume includes such cinematic gems like ""Dracula 2000,"" ""The Prophecy 3"" and ""White Noise 2"" opts to leave out such unnecessary trivialities, like a coherent plot, character motivations and explanations, and emotional drama, to give more time to the much more important special effects, action sequences, and 3-D elements. Why create a mood, when you can simply blow things up?

Pretty much everything else is just explosions, car chases, and blood-letting. Some of which is fairly well done and the one sole area the film tries to excel at. We get no real insights into Cage's or Heard's characters. The script has Cage telling us how much he loved his daughter and how Heard was ""waiting for something"" in her life, but it's never really bought to life in the film. There is absolutely zero emotional investment in any of these characters. Even in the most shoot-'em-up action-fest around, you need to make folks care about what happens to the hero. Such is never the case here, because to do that would take time away from blasting people with shotguns and watching cars race down the highway. Despite it's R-rating, the film actually feels like it's aimed to appeal to boys between 12-16 years-old, which is only fitting as the film is on the same maturity level.

In the end, ""Drive Angry"" is an empty barrel, as the amount of noise made during the viewing should no doubt tell you. It hits one-note throughout its 104 minute run time and never even tries to go beyond it. I could almost believe they wanted to make a grindhouse film, except the budget for the action and special effects goes against that, as well as going after a star of Nic Cage's level (although, with films like this to his credits, that might start to change). It's too ""shiny"" to be a grindhouse film, but too poorly conceived to be a true Hollywood action blockbuster. I suppose if you had a couple hours to kill and were looking for a totally mindless experience, you could do worse than this film. But for the action junkies out there, you have many other offerings that will fill your need for carnage, and are better made films, than this one is. It's really only one to see, when you've seen most everything else this film genre has to offer.",1307404800,,4085,4.691771269177127

However, I will readily admit that he does have a knack for picking winning pictures and I've enjoyed him in a few them. After watching Drive Angry I can say, without hesitation, that I am still not a cage fan. But I must say that I did enjoy this silly little movie.

Cage plays an absolutely driven Hell Block C- (one can only assume) escapee and is simply seething with fury. His motivation in this flick is clear and compelling: avenge daughter's murder; save his grandchild and, by extension, everything else. Lots of 70's era drive-in style sex and violence keep things moving along nicely, and the unexpected appearance in this movie by William Fichtner as ""The Accountant"" was a real bonus. Limited exposition regarding Cage's escape prevents the viewer being distracted from the chase, the language, and the overall slightly guilty pleasure which I believe this movie to be.

Drive Angry has all the following characteristics of a B-Movie:

1.) Nicholas Cage is in it.
2.) A very attractive Amber Heard displays a delightful quantity of cleavage and leg on the movie poster.
3.) The title is reminiscent of Golden Age pulp fiction.
4.) The plot involves a backwoods cult, the Devil's emissary, and an escapee from Hell.

When you're awake at 2:00 in the morning and fending off sobriety, this is the kind of movie you hope to find on Cinemax or HBO.

Does Drive Angry have these same shortcomings? Sure.  Did they stop the movie from being entertaining? Hell no! Do I have too many rhetorical questions in an Amazon movie review? Of course.

Basically, this film is made and written like that of a comic book,but a very badly written one. My dislike for this film isn't because of the gratuitous violence,the poorly written script and dialog,piss poor acting,the over use of the ""F""bomb, the poorly produced CG, or its plot/contents. Pretty much, this film sucks virtually from begining to end...its all bad. Its not because this film is tasteless,the writers and director just demonstrait the lack of effort put into the writing,scenes and dialog. It could have been a great deal better. You can't really pin point anything specific,its the film in its entirety that suffers and makes all the actors look like clowns. Its a badly written script based on a decent/interesting idea. Even in the featurette the writers admitted that this film was based on a ""rough draft"".How pathetic. Also to note, it appears that Nicolas Cage's personal life is also affecting his decision making concerning his film projects. He is still a great actor(I.M.O)with a great deal more to give and offer given the right material. I only hope he cleans his personal life up and in turn...makes better choices in his future film career. So pretty much what you have here is an obnoxious film with lots of swearing,stupid cartoon action/violence with lots of T&A and some soft porn.

In spite of the lack of any real moral high ground, I give credit to those involved for being brave enough to create such a film. I find it surprising this didn't garnish an X rating. Not just for the nudity and sexual content, which is the most I've seen in a long while, but for the level of violence which defines this work.

I docked it a star on a few points. Some of the effects were pretty; well; faky, unrealistic and downright silly. Not a huge factor in light of the premise and genre, but enough.

The acting was OK. William Fichtner, as previously noted, is good as the accountant, adding his usual flare with a few twists. Cage is promisingly not annoying or arrogant. His gun fighting is top notch and cool, as is the car action.

Don't watch this if you're sensitive to graphic violence because this movie is all about violence and evil for it's own sake. There are no men in white hats here.",1306972800,2,1108,4.364077669902913

4342367,4,B004EPYZOY,"The craze for 3-D movies is still working its way to the big screen across the country. I've found it amusing at times but on the whole I could do away with the need to wear a second pair of glasses let alone the extra expense that a ticket for a 3-D film entails. Perhaps it was that expense that caused DRIVE ANGRY to not be the big hit it was expected to be. This is unfortunate because all in all it was a fun film.

The films starts off with a bang as John Milton (Nicolas Cage) revs down the road in a muscle car intent on catching three bad guys in truck. He forces them to crash, shoots one's hand off, blasts the second and then threatens the third unless he gives him information. It seems that he is chasing a group of bad guys with one purpose: to save a baby they've kidnapped.

As the story unfolds we finally discover that Cage was a very bad man in his own right who was killed and sent to Hell. He escaped when he witness his daughter's death at the hands of Jonah King (Billie Burke), a satanic cult leader who intends to sacrifice her child on the next full moon in the hopes of bringing Hell to Earth. Milton has set his sights on revenge and only the rescue of the child and death of King will suffice.

As he sets out to track down King, Milton requires a new car having crashed the last one. A chance encounter with a young waitress named Piper (Amber Heard) leads to a ride down the road. When he saves her from an abusive boyfriend after she's been knocked unconscious, the pair head south for Florida via Louisiana. FL is her destination, LA his.

Along the way the pair is being followed by two different people. The first is a man who refers to himself as ""The Accountant"" (William Fichtner). In actuality this is Hell's agent on Earth trying to track down and recollect Milton. Why he can't just pop in and out where he wants is never explained but like all Hell employed bounty hunters he just follows and kills along his way to catch the escapee.

A run in with the followers of King leads to Piper and Milton being captured. As King speeds off with Piper and the baby having just shot Milton one would think the film would end. But keep in mind that Milton is already dead and a headshot won't be the sort of thing to stop him.

The film rolls along with tons of car chases and mayhem, explosions and gunfight, until a final confrontation between Milton and King finally arrives.

This is the stuff that drive-in movies were made of back in their heyday during the seventies: cars speeding down the highway, cults that just seem downright stupid, gun battles using guns that never seem to run out of ammo and a smattering of nudity here and there. As I watched I kept thinking of past films like VANISHING POINT and RACE WITH THE DEVIL, to classics of the genre.

The film is filled with completely unbelievable items that you either accept as part of the universe it is set in or just shake your head asking how anyone could expect you to believe it at all. Perhaps the most extreme (and the raciest) is when Milton is in the middle of having sex only to leap up still attached and begin shooting bad guys left and right. Not only does this tell you how unbelievable the film is but also how it got the R rating it deserves as well.

Cage does a great job as the determined tough guy out to take down those worse than him for a noble cause. Fichtner is amazing to watch as the smooth operating collector who feels no remorse taking out various bad guys or telling people he'll seem them soon, some in years others in months. And Heard plays the young woman sucked into a world she is completely unaware of only to feel the need to help Milton in his quest.

Some will be offended by the whole sacrifice idea (used in tons of movies in the 60s and 70s before it became something to really fear), some will not be keen on the idea of a hero in the form of an escapee from Hell and others will be offended by the bloodshed and nudity. I mention these as a warning for those easily offended.

Still reading? For those who are, give this movie a chance, being a Nicholas Cage fan doesn't hurt either, enjoy!",1306713600,,922,4.80503144654088
4342369,4,B004EPYZOY,"Drive Angry has everything you could want from a trashy action film: cool muscle cars, over-the-top shoot-outs, larger than life baddies, and a cool good guy with a mission.

There is an audio commentary by director Patrick Lussier and co-screenwriter Todd Farmer. Lussier jokingly refers to Drive Angry as his ""subtle, gentle road movie,"" and battles through a bad case of laryngitis, which makes it difficult at times to understand what he's trying to say. But he soldiers on with Farmer as they talk about how the film was made. The two men tell all kinds of filming anecdotes as they talk us through filming. Lussier points out that Clint Eastwood's protagonist in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Plains-Drifter/dp/0783225725/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Plains Drifter</a>&nbsp;was the model for Nicolas Cage's character. They give shout-outs to various crew members' contributions on this solid track.

""How To: Drive Angry"" is one of the better promotional featurettes. Amazingly, the studio gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do a hard R-rated supernatural action film. They talk about shooting in 3D as opposed to converting it in post-production. The filmmakers also talk about working with a modest budget and solving certain problems creatively as opposed to throwing a lot of money at it a la Michael Bay. It's nice to see that many of the stunts in the film were done practically.

""Milton's Mayhem"" is an amusing extra that compiles all of Milton's action sequences and attributes a point system to every punch and gunshot like something out of a video game.

Finally, there are two deleted scenes with optional commentary by Lussier and Farmer. We see a little more with Piper and her boyfriend and another scene with the Accountant that were both rightly cut.",1306627200,2,1836,5.431578947368421
4342449,1,B004EPYZOY,"How far would you go for someone you love?  After the murder of his daughter and the kidnapping of his grandchild John Milton (Cage), escapes from Hell and tries to save the baby from a cult.  Before we begin I should let you know that I am not, nor have ever been a Nic Cage fan.  There are a handful of movies of his that I do like, and this one is in no way part of that group.  After watching the preview I was not looking forward to watching this and after seeing it, it was much worse then I expected. I really am speechless about this movie.  The effects were kinda cool.  William Fichtner was actually good in this, but the dialog made his character not as threatening as he could have been. This is from the same director of ""My Bloody Valentine"", so if you have seen that you know what to expect.  The fact that this movie tried to take itself seriously and not a tounge-in-cheek movie like ""Machete"" was makes it even worse.  Roger Ebert says you should not be friends with anyone that likes this.  Peter Travers says it would be better if you were stoned or at least buzzed.  I say the movie was 97% total crap, the 3% is because there was a lot of nudity.  I know many people will love this because there are a lot of Cage fans that rent from us.  That makes me sad.  A big perk of my job is getting to watch for free and not paying $12 for a 3-D theater movie. I just wish I could get the 2 hours back.  I give it a D-.

Would I watch again? - No chance in Hell (get it?)

4342450,5,B004EPYZOY,"John Milton (Nicolas Cage) has broken out of Hell to save his infant granddaughter from a satanic cult lead by Jonah King (Billy Burke). With the help of Piper (Amber Heard), a young waitress, John pursues King while being pursued himself by The Accountant (William Fichtner), whose mission is to bring John back to Hell. Shot in 3D by director Patrick Lussier, Drive Angry is an over-the-top exploitation film that never takes itself too seriously and fits the grindhouse model exactly as intended. Lussier has never been celebrated for directing quality films (his filmography includes Dracula 2000 and White Noise 2: The Light), but he proves to be capable of directing an unpretentious, balls-out action movie which still works no matter how over-the-top it gets and retains remarkable coherency, never descending into pure stupidity. The film knows what it's doing and it does it well.

Drive Angry is gleefully offensive, loaded with gratuitous violence and nudity, and even managed to impress me with its use of the 3D format. Lussier exploits 3D as the gimmick it is (blood, coins, etc. pop out of the screen whenever there's an opportunity) rather than trying to use it ""artistically"" to the extent that it might as well be seen in 2D. It's equally enjoyable in both formats, but there are shots in the 2D version that were obviously specific to the 3D format. As for the action sequences, there are many high-energy chase scenes that are remarkably comprehensible for a Hollywood film, relying on stunt work and form rather than quick cuts and hyperactive edits. Another scene, involving a gunfight while Milton and a woman are in a rather ""delicate"" position has been done before (notably in Shoot `Em Up), but it takes it even further here. It's great fun, but it's the type of scene that may alert you as to whether this film is for you or not.

Lussier and his co-writer Todd Farmer have fashioned a script of well-written exploitation that never feels too forced and pushes everything to go further than you'd imagine. This is one of those rare movies that successfully uses its dialogue for the sole purpose of fitting in one-liners and furthering the plot. More impressive is the dialogue is actually legitimately funny and clever rather than desperately trying to be memorable or hip.

The cast is made-up of talented character actors lead by master thespian Nicolas Cage. Cage is one of the most misunderstood actors of his generation, frequently accused of sleepwalking through terrible movies for a paycheck. Drive Angry may not look like an exception, but it is. Cage is a master of over-the-top theatrics and this type of film is perfect for allowing his acting instincts to run wild. Oddly enough, for such an over-the-top movie, Cage is remarkably subdued. It's not often that Cage plays a character in a movie with the least amount of quirks; he often seems to be trying to top any other actor who approaches him in the realm of ""quirkiness."" Still, John Milton is one of the few roles that Cage plays almost completely straight. He does a fine job as Milton and even those who are typically anti-Cage shouldn't be bothered much by his performance. I, however, wish he would've injected a little more style into his performance.

Piper is tough, independent, and curses like a sailor. As played by the gorgeous Amber Heard, she also happens to be...gorgeous. Believe me; the camera is fully aware of that. Heard isn't generally grouped into the ""serious, young actress"" category, but despite being a petite, model-looking woman she actually makes Piper believable and will no doubt appeal to both young women for her strong-willed attitude and young men for...Being Amber Heard. Impressively, Heard and Cage actually make a good team here and play well off of each other, while simultaneously establishing a convincing emotional bond. That type of chemistry is not required for this type of film, but it successfully adds another dimension to the work.

Billy Burke has spent the last few years playing the thankless role of Kristen Stewart's father in the Twilight series, where he usually outshines the entire cast with his subtle performance. As the suave, devilishly charming and equally evil, Jonah King, I didn't even recognize him as the same actor. Even in a role that requires the actor only to have fun, he demonstrates remarkable range.

Despite this talent involved, it is character actor William Fichtner who steals every scene as The Accountant. It's such a delightfully quirky performance that will hopefully obtain the cult status it deserves. An actor used to hanging out in the background, Fichtner pushes this character to the forefront with his fascinating interpretation of the character. His performance as the Accountant is compulsively watchable and absolutely hilarious, with his comedic timing responsible for many of the funniest moments in the movie. I would love to see a spin-off with the Accountant and Milton working together; or just the Accountant chasing someone else. Without trying to overstate it, Fichtner is so good I believe every action movie should have its own accountant.

The film also features David Morse and Jack McGee (from The Fighter). It's obvious that everyone involved was having a lot of fun making this movie and that translates well onscreen, actually increasing the overall effectiveness of the film. Drive Angry is not a great film, but it is great grindhouse fodder and just a purely fun movie. There are those who heap praise on it and those who trash it mercilessly but after two viewings, I stand by my initial assessment that this is one of the best, most entertaining, and most clever films of its kind. A lovingly crafted piece of exploitation, a fun piece of filmmaking, and probably the most fun I've had in 2011.

4342457,5,B004EPYZOY,"If you have any morals, this movie is not for you. Thankfully, I do not. Drive Angry is sure to offend some(the ones who shouldn't see it in the first place), for others, it will be an extremely satisfying affair. Packed full of F bombs, shot off limbs, and naked trailer trash, Drive Angry goes full throttle for all of its 104 minutes. As a huge Nicolas Cage fan(minus The Wicker Man and 8MM), he doesn't disappoint, but he wasn't the scene stealer. This honor would go to William Fichtner(the Accountant) for his hilarious portrayal of Satan's bounty hunter(in a way). Amber Heard also quite impresses as a strong female co-star who can hold her own in a fight.

While the plot is not incredibly complex(man escapes hell to rescue his granddaughter from a cult that plans to sacrifice her), it is enjoyable. Packed full of all the guilty pleasures and soon to be classic one liners, Drive Angry will not disappoint the sinner inside you.",1298937600,166,940,4.662650602409639
4342458,1,B004EPYZOY,"I knew this would be a shallow movie going in but I was mistaken that the 3D aspect would be able to compensate for that.  Worse, there were a lot of double lines in my Real 3D viewing of this movie and the 3D didn't pop or thrill or add anything to the movie.
As for the film, it was extremely violent but not giddily exessive enough to push this movie into the catagory of trashy pleasure.  In short, a man escapes hell to save the life of his granddaughter from a satanic cult with an ""accountant"" from hell on his tail to bring him (and a stolen God-killing gun)back.  Cage's character and everyone else was strictly comic book depth.  There was some humor in two performances -- the accountant and the heroine's fiance -- but there was a lot in this movie that made my eyes roll back in their sockets.  I'm glad some people enjoy this movie on the level it was intended but it left me annoyed and cold.  Piranha 3D was another bad movie but it went that step extra into excess that this movie didn't do, despite the many explosions and gunshot wounds.
