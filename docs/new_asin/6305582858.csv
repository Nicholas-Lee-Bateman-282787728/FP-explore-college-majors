7891930,3,6305582858,"This is another of those notoriously retitled kung fu films released as part of the ""Wu Tang Collection."" The title on the box is ""Killer Bs"" and the box art features a still from another movie (HOLY WEAPON) featuring prominent Hong Kong actresses who are not in this movie. The actual movie is THE WOMAN AVENGER (1980), aka FATAL CLAWS, DEADLY KICKS, and it features an unsung femme fighting star, the Peking Opera-trained Hsia Kwan Li, who participates in nearly all of the many fight scenes and does many of her own stunts.
Miss Hsia plays Ling Chi, a woman whose husband was murdered by bandits who then raped her and left her for dead. She's rescued by a Buddhist abbess who teaches her Dragon Fist kung fu. She then goes off to track down the men who attacked her. When she comes up against the leader of the gang, a master of Twin Style fighting, she is rescued from defeat by a second female fighter who teaches her Twin Style so she can defeat the villain.
What's significant about this film is not only that it features a solo female fighting star without a male partner, but that her two teachers in the film are both women, the first kung fu film I've seen to offer this distinction. Hsia Kwan Li may not be as intense or ferocious a female fighter as Angela Mao (STING OF THE DRAGON MASTERS) or Chia Ling (SHAOLIN INVINCIBLES), but she offers layers of feminine charm and attractive looks that go well with a showy fighting style dependent more on acrobatic and gymnastic moves than on mastery of lethal kicks and thrusts. Miss Hsia is also seen prominently in THE LEG FIGHTERS and in a smaller role in THE STOMP.
The print used for this tape is full-frame and pretty scratchy, but the transfer is sharper than many comparable Wu Tang Collection releases. The English dubbing is above average, especially on the part of the actresses who dub the three main female characters.",1057276800,3,1888,4.572271386430678
7891931,5,6305582858,"This film is very well produced and has a cast of top-notch martial artists. It is a serious film, without the slapstick comedy found in many kungfu movies, with a simple but interesting plot. The heroine of the film is played by Hsia Kwan Lee, who is a very good actress and martial artist, she definitely is as good as her more famous counterparts such as Shang Kwan (Polly Shang Kwan) and Mao Ying (Angela Mao). It is easy to see that the rest of the cast is also very proficient in martial arts, making every fight scene excellent.
The story of the film is this: The main character Lo Ling Chi (Hsia Kwan Lee) is travelling with her husband, carrying valuables, when they are attacked by bandits. She is raped by the bandits, her husband is killed, and their valuables are stolen. Lo Ling Chi is taken in by Buddhist abess Wu Chien, who teaches her Dragon style kungfu. After she has completed her kungfu training, Lo sets out to get revenge on the bandits (Mao Di, Wong Chi Sheng, Chang Kwan Lung, and Pang Gang). Near the end of the film she meets a woman (Yang Pan Pan a.k.a. Sharon Yeung) who is also seeking revenge on Pang Gang, and she teachers Lo her kungfu style; the Twin Boxing style.
The film, directed by Lee Tso Nam, is very well made. The editing and cinematography is more sophisticated than in most kungfu films, giving the film a more serious and powerful tone. The use of traditional Chinese music was also very good, adding to the emotional mood of the film. Some of the highlights of the film are the two training sequences, one near the beginning in Dragon style, and the other near the end in Twin Boxing style. Every fight in the film is very good due to the abilities of the cast, and Hsia's use of acrobatic kicks in the fights are amazing. The fights were choreographed using pure kungfu; no tricks, magic, or comedy, which fits the mood of the film. The only flaw I found in this film is that this is a fullscreen version, so sometimes things are cut out of the frame. That does not subtract from the film though. It is good to see a movie with female martial artists when some kungfu movies do not have a woman in the entire film.
*Note: The photo on the box cover is not from this film.",1047772800,2,2220,4.3647342995169085

Super fight scenes and a great main character (not to mention cute:)) a  tough ruthless villian with a very unique deadly style, and a strong story.  Go girl",965088000,2,982,4.302197802197802
