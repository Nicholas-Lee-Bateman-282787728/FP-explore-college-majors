5856715,5,B00DUQ09K2,"I was looking for something that would be a quick way  of getting familiar with the buttons of the nikon d7100, and this videos does that
and so much more. I would describe myself as an intermediate photographer who still has a lot to learn. I like the way Michael presents things with clear examples! There's definitely  a lot to learn from this DVD.  WORTH the MONEY!",1380326400,13,369,4.477611940298507
5856716,4,B00DUQ09K2,It filled the gap between the book that came with the D7100 and the knowledge I needed to start feeling comfortable with it as the new D7100 is a major up grade from my D80.,1378166400,11,173,3.9714285714285715
5856717,5,B00DUQ09K2,This was an EXCELLENT video! I can't imagine ever going back to the hard cover manual trying to figure out what it is trying to tell me. I love how I feel like this crash course video  is a personal private lesson with Michael! It's fantastic and I'm feeling much more comfortable with my camera! I love it!,1374796800,14,307,4.293103448275862

5856721,5,B00DUQ09K2,"First DVD was labeled with UPC code for the item ordered, but the video it contained was about a Canon camera, not the Nikon D7100. Replacement DVD had defective area, causing DVD player to repeatedly eject it.
UPDATE:
Despite the original problems, Kate at Michael the Maven.com responded immediately, generously and courteously, going out of her way to make things right. Every company would benefit greatly from following her example as to how to support a product and how to respond to customer feedback. The company clearly cares about customer relations, and while problems can arise in any business, this kind of response will ultimately create a happy customer.",1439424000,2,669,5.146788990825688
5856722,5,B00DUQ09K2,A very good tutorial for us beginners.  Useful & topic specific.  I like this dvd.  Worth buying!,1439337600,,97,4.588235294117647

5856725,5,B00DUQ09K2,"Great DVD!! This DVD is not only for beginners. There is so much content in these lessons for any level. Its a must for setting up your D7100. Like another reviewer I first bought a few books on the camera and found it hard to read the book, put it down, make the adjustments, and go back to the book. This is the easy way. I also found this DVD to be very entertaining at the same time. Never a dull moment. Michael quickly touches on some general photography subjects in the beginning that were great. There were some things I thought I knew as an experienced photographer but could see I really never understood totally.

One thing I liked with this DVD is the editing. There is nothing unnecessary in the lessons. Its straight rapid fire learning. Highly recommended.",1431388800,,771,4.507142857142857
5856726,5,B00DUQ09K2,"So glad I purchased this. Great course. Better than sitting in a class. Can watch in my home, pause and rewind when I need to. Love it!",1430956800,,135,4.037037037037037
5856727,5,B00DUQ09K2,"Best buy we have done in a long time, very helpful and good instructions how to use the camera have been to evening classes and did not learn as well as we have done with this training video. You can go back and stop it when there is a need. Thank you",1430870400,,251,3.8461538461538463
5856728,1,B00DUQ09K2,"I give this Maven crash course a 1 star because there is no way to give it a '0'.  My problem with this product is the impossibility of actually down loading it to my computer.  After several phone calls to a phone answering service; ""sorry sir, their phones must be down"", I sent an email asking where my download was.  Kate from customer service sent me a 'secret password' to use.  I'm still wondering why this password wasen't originally provided with the first confirmation of the order, and why the two passwords that I created didn't work. Upon finally accessing the downloads; they failed to open on my computer.  5 e-mails later I finally requested a refund; which I have yet to receive.  Michael is very slick at selling this course but fails at producing in an accessible form.  I have nothing to say about the quality of the video, because I never got to view it.",1429920000,,875,4.535031847133758
5856729,5,B00DUQ09K2,BIG help in navigating through my new camera.  Too many functions to sit and read a crumby manual.  Keep up the good work Michael!!,1429660800,,131,4.416666666666667
5856730,5,B00DUQ09K2,If you have a Nikon this is a must for any user. Very easy and sensible advice to help make those great shots. Happy shooting!,1425081600,,126,4.08
5856731,5,B00DUQ09K2,Very informative!,1420848000,,17,8.0
5856732,5,B00DUQ09K2,"Quite impressive.  I am an amateur photographer, not a pro, but I have lots of experience, have taken various photography courses and have been shooting since I was 8 (46 years).  I have always been happy with my photos but always wanted more.  I am very critical.

Upon purchasing a D7100, I thought it might be useful to purchase this video.  It was money well spent.  The D7100 overview is much better than you could get from the manual.  When you watch the video keep your camera in your hands - it will definitely clear things up.  The D7100 is a feature-rich camera and the video will help you make the most of it.  Sure, you can take your D7100 out of the box take acceptable photos, and have fun - I did prior to the arrival of my video.  Once I saw the video I began to really understand how powerful the D7100 really is. And though I have always produced well-composed photos; I also found the composition portion of the video to be quite good.  I actually learned a lot from the video.

I noticed that reviewers that gave it one star did not like the quality. In their defense, I will say that if you are expecting a super high-quality production - you will not find it here. The quality is ""YouTube-Like"".  I like the fact that Mike's hair style is not consistent through the video :-).  However, the content is great.

Mike's explains topics clearly, in easily digestible chunks.  Topics are arranged in an orderly fashion.

I highly suggest purchasing the video before deciding on which additional lenses to buy - It is worth it for this alone.  Lenses are often the largest expense when purchasing a camera.  I personally would rather not think back at how many pricy lenses I have purchased in the past and barely used.",1420502400,3,1735,4.485623003194888
5856733,5,B00DUQ09K2,Very informative since I entered the DSLR world... Michael's lessons were all great been watching the video all over again and learned  chapter by chapter. Now time to practice on the outside world. Great product every beginner should by who owns a Nikon D7100!!!,1419811200,,263,4.9772727272727275

5856735,5,B00DUQ09K2,"I thought this was an excellent, and worthwhile product, not inexpensive, but the amount of information  provided , made it good value for money...Frankly I never thought I was ever going to use my expensive camera , but this DVD sure helped to make operating the camera much easier, not to mention the mini lessons on the fundamentals of good photography...Very helpful, clear, and enjoyable to watch  Highly recommended, now I'm comfortable with, and enjoy using my camera in creative ways...",1415318400,,494,5.08641975308642

5856737,5,B00DUQ09K2,Michael does a thorough job of covering the majority of all the aspects of the D7100. His illustrations and unhurried explanations are very helpful. I refer back to the particular segment I may need for that day. Great job Michael!,1402963200,2,231,4.8
5856738,5,B00DUQ09K2,"Starting with ""Michael's Digital Photography School"" (composing, portraits, landscapes, framing basics, power points etc) to whet the appetite for using your camera well, this DVD is a real winner.  It is a personal introduction to DSLR photography in general and then the D7100 in particular.  Quickly demystifying the range of external buttons and dials and encouraging the camera owner to gravitate mostly to Aperture Priority - and understand what the camera is doing with Shutter Speed and ISO to set the exposure - is a comfortable method of getting the user feeling ""in control"" of this tool.  Thanks Mike.",1402272000,2,613,5.171717171717172
5856739,5,B00DUQ09K2,"Although the production of this video was in segments, the information, approach, clarity of delivery and assistance was outstanding.  I would recommend this to any novice or intermediate photographer.",1392940800,3,201,5.931034482758621
5856740,5,B00DUQ09K2,This crash course for beginners is just what I was looking for to help me learn my camera more quickly and tips for taking photos.  Michael gives you the information in easy to understand terms and demonstrations/pictures.,1391126400,,222,5.0
5856741,5,B00DUQ09K2,"Great training film and well organized.  Structured to watch specific areas over again as necessary.  Not a ""dry"" presentation.  Covers all the basics.  Well worth the investment.",1391040000,3,179,5.518518518518518
5856742,5,B00DUQ09K2,This DVD is great!!!  I am a beginner and he teaches the material in such a way that I easily understand. I'm only halfway through but am excited every time I go to a new chapter because I always seem to learn so much!!  Great for any beginner!,1390867200,2,244,4.0625
5856743,5,B00DUQ09K2,"I like to ""dig in"" when I get a new tech product, and for the record my photography experience goes back 40+ years. I am demanding of my cameras and do whatever I need to to get the most out of them.
The basic premise of the camera has not changed. And the hardware still pretty much has to do what it did since its invention: record an image for future use.

That said, the Nikon D7100 owners manual was a daunting thing to use to learn to use this camera. I'm sure all the information is in there, but the layout, with page referencing having one flipping back and forth was time consuming and irksome. I gave it a week. While I had what I was sure were the basics, I still felt as if a stranger to a device I needed to know intimately.

When I found this video guide, initially a single youtube ""chapter"" on focus systems, led me to the full version of the video, I was both excited and skeptical. Seemed a lot of money for what should all be in the manual... right? I bought it anyway, out of desperation to see if it would help.

It helped!

With camera in lap and remote in hand, I was able to watch through every control aspect of using this camera in just a couple evenings! Suddenly I was ""connected"" to my camera!  The menus of the DVD are easy to understand, if you need to go back for a refresh on any item, and as an added plus, there is a very good photography tutorial section to take anyone through understanding the basics of photography.

Nikon should just buy the rights from Michael and include this course in every camera box, or make them available to any purchaser online.

Highly recommended!",1390089600,21,1616,4.261437908496732
5856744,5,B00DUQ09K2,"Very simply , fantastic and easy to understand . Plan on getting more of his courses as soon as finances permit .",1389312000,,113,4.181818181818182
5856745,5,B00DUQ09K2,"I have purchased Michael Andrew's crash course tutorials in the past for myself and always loved them. My mom and dad bought a D7100 to get better pictures of family events, grandkid's sporting events, etc. My mom used to have an old 35mm Nikon and loved taking pictures. What they didn't consider is the complexity of modern DSLR's. They felt very discouraged and have been barely using the camera. As a Christmas gift I bought them this tutorial.

I sat down with my mom and watched the DVD so I could help her if needed. The tutorials come in two parts. The first part assumes you're a beginner or intermediate and will take you through all the basics such as shutter speed, aperture, ISO, etc. Just having a visual and someone who speaks plainly in a teacher/student context is invaluable. She's already grasping the concepts easily thanks to the courses. She's already moved out of fully automatic mode (with my encouragement) and making creative decisions with her settings (after one viewing).

The second part goes over all of the functions, buttons, and in's-and-out's of the specific camera. It's awesome to have an in-depth understanding of what each button and menu screen means and does. The tutorial is extremely comprehensive. As I said, the teacher (Michael Andrew) speaks plainly and clearly and breaks everything down into understandable terms.

So far, she's doing great and loves the DVD. The menu's are laid out and labeled so she can easily go back and look at specific lessons. I think she's going to find a new passion with her camera and that makes me happy. Thanks to the DVD she no longer feels overwhelmed and confused.",1388102400,11,1647,4.833333333333333
5856746,5,B00DUQ09K2,"4.5 hours! Wow, it`s a long one but a good one! Totally loved the fact he went thru the entire menu
and helped you preset your camera prior to using it. A must have for the beginner but a great training
video for anyone who wants to up their game when it comes to your photography. Well worth buying
this gem!",1387670400,7,309,4.081967213114754
5856747,1,B00DUQ09K2,Quality was very poor. It was basically a bunch of YouTube videos put together. The DVD interface looks like it was something from the early 90s. It was definitely not worth the price that were asking for it. At the most this DVD should only cost $14.95 and that's being generous.,1383696000,6,280,4.509803921568627

8597990,5,B00DUQ09K2,"Although I own a D7000 and have the basic control of the camera, this DVD was very good in covering all aspects of the basics of photography and the controls and menus of the Nikon D7100 (very similar to the D7000).
