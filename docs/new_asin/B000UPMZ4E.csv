2923854,5,B000UPMZ4E,"I love the world of Little Britain and was totally excited to find this two episode set that I had never heard of.  Hilariously irreverent, inappropriately hilarious, and insufferably British.  The two episodes contained on this DVD see our favorite characters from the original series travel abroad and wreak havoc on several continents.  This contains incredibly memorable appearances by Ronnie Corbett and Dawn French, who plays the mother of troubled teen Vicky Pollard in one of the series most memorable and hilarious skits. Highly recommended to fans of the series or British comedy such as Ab Fab, Fawlty Towers, French & Saunders, etc.",1227398400,2,644,5.233009708737864
2923855,5,B000UPMZ4E,"I keep going back to this series.  These two guys just make me laugh.  So creative, so irreverent.  Can't WAIT for the debut of their American series!",1218240000,,150,4.481481481481482
2923856,5,B000UPMZ4E,"I thought this DVD was amazing!  It had all I needed to get my Little Britain fix although, in the deleted scenes, there was one scene that should have made it to the main video and that was a scene with ""Linda"" the secretary for the ever elusive ""Martin"".  Once you see it, you will know what I mean.(I don't want to spoil it for anyone!)  If you are a Little Britain fan, you will most definately love this DVD, Little Britain Abroad.  With Andy up to his old tricks and Carol chaperoning a tour group....you'll love it!!",1199664000,8,523,4.3061224489795915
2923857,5,B000UPMZ4E,"If you have never seen this duo, get this dvd - it is ""the best of"" really.  You will laugh and laugh.  I purchased the entire set, this was included, and am watching it for the 2nd time around.  I believe this duo to be the funniest comedy I've ever watched and the best money I've ever spent on dvds.  I am sure we will watch it over and over again - just use subtitles if you aren't from the UK, so in the places where they talk really really fast (as part of the comedy), you can understand it all -- especially with ""Vicky Pollard"".  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!",1198281600,7,563,3.9910714285714284
2923858,4,B000UPMZ4E,"Fans of Little Britain appreciate any chance to revisit the world of wacky characters created by this amazing comic team. While I must say that this two-part Christmas special may not quite be as fresh and funny as the original series, much like the Ab Fab Christmas specials, there are always a few astoundingly good laughs and the comfort of the familiar.

What's more, there's the star studded Comic Relief version of Little Britain Live. Yes, many of them are stars that aren't quite huge in the U.S. but it's fun to see them try to hold their own with the immensely talented Lucas and Walliams.",1194393600,21,599,4.650943396226415
2923869,5,B000UPMZ4E,Great addition to the Little Britain series if you already have the other seasons. It's a short program but there are a lot of extras on it.,1366934400,,140,4.222222222222222
2923870,3,B000UPMZ4E,"David Williams and Matt Lucas are back as the comedy duo in LITTLE BRITAIN. This time the boys take their antics abroad. The BBC series had ended and this was a Christmas special. Unfortunately, ABROAD lacks a lot of enthusiasm and hilarity of the actual series. Williams and Lucas seem to be running on empty and trying to milk comedy out of characters that need a rest.

Some of the characters can give an uneasy feeling to some viewers. A great deal of humor revolves around the overweight, immigrants and gays. Some of the humor is just silly but some viewers may take offense to some antics. Of course, LITTLE BRITAIN is not meant to be light comedy. The duo is often compared to MONTY PYTHON but Pythom humor was normally absurd and slapstick. Their humor was silliness in a harmless way. LITTLE BRITAIN has taken it 10 steps further. In one of the bonus features, Williams gets a letter saying a viewer of a live show was traumatized by a skit. Although Williams is obviously concerned he decides that anything and anyone is fair game in comedy, so expect to be offended or to feel uneasy at times watching LITTLE BRITAIN ABROAD.

Like the Python gang, Williams and Lucas delight in dressing in drag. Lucas is constantly donning fat suits to look even larger.  That seems to be a key factor in slapstick British humor. The seriously annoying Vicki Pollard is in in a Thai jail. Lou and Andy end up as plane crash survivors on a deserted island. Severely overweight and disgustingly annoying Bubbles Devere (Matt Lucas in an antatomically correct ""fat"" suit)delights in removing her clothes. Someone brings home an overweight Thai wife named Tink Tong. I couldn't even figure out who was in the fat suit this time.

But there are hints of Monty Python in some skits. Elderly friends Maggie and Judy are on holiday together. These conservative ladies would never tolerate a hint of scandal. Unfortunatley for Judy, Maggie makes ""the moves"" on her. Here is some silly slapstick humor as Maggie is unaware that she is a lesbian. Alternative relationships continue. The British Prime Minister and the US President have a very special relationship behind closed doors that goes far beyond international politicals.
And finally there is Karen the tour representative in Spain. We've all dealt with a Karen in life whose has no interest in customer service.

Although the LITTLE BRITAIN ABROAD episodes are brief, the DVD does have a lot of bonus features that are lengthy. LITTLE BRITAIN does a tour in Australia and appears on Comic Relief. The boys meet up with Australia's Grand Dame of Drag, Dame Edna, so the humor continues.

Overall, LITTLE BRITAIN ABROAD is weaker then the series on all levels. It seems like Williams and Lucas are ready to move on to other projects so the writing and the characters suffer. If you are a fan of LITTLE BRITAIN, you'll want to see this DVD. If you are new to LITTLE BRITAIN, do yourself a favor and start with Season One of LITTLE BRITAIN.",1366156800,2,2981,4.734104046242774
2923871,4,B000UPMZ4E,Little Britain is a great Comedy show back. it is one of the best sketch comedy shows ever made. i highly recommend any British comedy fan buying this show. it is too bad this season only has 2 episodes,1351987200,,202,4.205128205128205
2923872,5,B000UPMZ4E,...you should get this.  My favorite character is Bubbles!  If you've seen any of the Little britain series then you already know this but it's funny and more entertaining then a Redbox night...,1318723200,,194,4.848484848484849
2923873,5,B000UPMZ4E,"As a die-hard Little Britain fan, I love everything Little Britain has done, but when I need a quick fix, I never tire of Little Britain Abroad. You can watch the entire DVD in an hour, and it's good for many laughs. Carol Beer leads a dreadful trip to Spain (check out her Spanish counterpart: COUGH!); Maggie takes Judy on a Mussolini-themed tour of Rome (with a surprising dnouement!); Daffvyd attempts to establish himself as ""the only gay"" on Mykonos; Vicky Pollard, on trial for drug smuggling in Thailand, wears out the court stenographer when Dawn French appears as her mum/character witness; Ting Tong snares Mr. Dudley and triumphs after a grim honeymoon in a Belgian trailer park; Lou and Andy are in ""a bit of a kerfuffle"" when they crash land en route to Disney World; much more. Also of interest is the running commentary by David Walliams and Matt Lucas revealing where the ""abroad"" segments were actually filmed. An endearing gem of a DVD; a must-see for all Little Britain fans.",1265760000,,995,4.757225433526012
