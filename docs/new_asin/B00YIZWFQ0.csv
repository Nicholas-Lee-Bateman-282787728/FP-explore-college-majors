7222183,1,B00YIZWFQ0,"This is horrid.  First it is not an exercise program set to any ones all time favorite hits.  Two songs from the 50/60 a Temptation song, whoever that is, and a bad cover of the twist. So even if I wanted to turn off the obnoxious laugh the music is bad.  Nothing different for movements, hard to hit a decent heart rate.  It was disorganized, they were all over the map during the twist no order whatsoever, and it slow pace.  If you have boobs beware a lot of bouncing not walking.  Lastly, since when does anyone want to see some 70 year old guy, on the front row, sweating and showing his long nasty armpit hair - this was through at least a third of the video.  It was so simply gross. And she kept encouraging him as well!  OMG!  So disappointed....",1438646400,6,755,4.223776223776224
7222184,5,B00YIZWFQ0,This is a very good exercise dvd. Gives you a good workout and easy to follow. I really like this workout and I do it often.,1524528000,,124,3.8076923076923075
7222185,5,B00YIZWFQ0,We exercise the one of Leslie's videos daily.,1524096000,,45,4.75
7222186,4,B00YIZWFQ0,"This is an excellent workout!  However, Im giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the time.  For a 3 mile HIIT workout, this is almost an hour long, whereas the other 2 Walk to the Hits programs are only 45 minutes long.  I don't know about you, but an extra 10-15 minutes makes a huge difference in my busy schedule.

Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this workout!  It was super fun & I loved all the new moves.  Leslie incorporated a lot of different higher impact moves such as twists, squat variations, bounces, etc.  I consider myself to be intermediate/advanced fitness level, so I really appreciate the new moves.  Keep in mind, if you're restricted to only low impact exercises, Leslie always gives you the option to modify!",1523404800,,734,4.635658914728682
7222187,3,B00YIZWFQ0,"The ""HITS music"" was only a few good songs otherwise its synthizer beats and I just don't care for that.",1522713600,,104,4.25

7222190,3,B00YIZWFQ0,I thought there would be more music with words being that it said with the hits. There was like 3 songs and one was the twist which was for like 4 mins which was way too much,1519603200,,174,3.72972972972973

7222193,5,B00YIZWFQ0,I have an abundance of Leslie's videos and DVDs I have walked to for quite a number of years and never disappointed.  Gives me quite a variety to use.  This one is enjoyable as have the hits to walk to.,1517097600,,202,4.025
7222194,1,B00YIZWFQ0,this dvd was great until I tore my calf muscle from the twisting she did...now I am laid up for 4 to 6 weeks until it heals..needless to say I will NOT be doing this workout ever again,1515715200,,184,3.8684210526315788

7222199,5,B00YIZWFQ0,I love this DVD because it is extremely motivating and lots of fun.  The workout is as challenging as you want it to be meaning Leslie gives you lots of options depending on your fitness level. I have many of Leslie's DVDs and this one did not disappoint!,1511913600,,255,4.3125
7222200,3,B00YIZWFQ0,"Out of all of the ""Walk to the Hits,"" this is probably my least favorite.  There are a few issues with the video: 1)the visual quality is a tad low, 2)the sound almost sounds like Leslie is speaking under water 3)the music is meh and 4)some of the exercises may be a tad stressful or uncomfortable.

Specifically, in regards to the visual quality, it is fuzzy, almost like one is watching a VHS.  In regards to the sound, I had to turn up the volume really loud to be able to hear Leslie, which is not that much of a big deal, but slightly annoying.  The actual ""hits"" that are in the DVD are from like the Temptations, which is perfectly fine, but the majority of the program includes generic music, which I found boring.  There were also a few new exercises in this DVD that I had not seen in her other videos and that was nice, but some of them, for me, like the twisting were slightly uncomfortable on carpet. Had I been on hardwood, it probably would have been fine. This program also has quite a bit of jumping so I had to modify those parts because my knees can't take the jumping for long periods.  I wear a Fitbit while working out and out of all of her ""Walk to the Hits"" I definitely came closer to 3 miles with this program than with the other programs and burned more calories.

Overall, I would give this DVD a B-, but I don't regret purchasing it.",1510876800,,1362,4.235521235521236
7222201,5,B00YIZWFQ0,"Good workout DVD. I own a few other Walk to the Hits dvds. This one is the longest that I have tried. The music is good, but I like the Party Hits better. Overall it is a good workout and it's nice to shake things up a bit.",1509926400,,223,3.6666666666666665

7222209,5,B00YIZWFQ0,"I have several of Leslie's walking DVDs and this one is my favorite so far.  She has the same basic steps, but throws in some new moves, and the higher intensity seems to last longer in this workout.  i burn 50 to 100 calories more when I use this DVD, and if I use my ankle weights or weighted vest, I burn more.  I was surprised how fast this workout went by because I was having fun doing it.  I hope she makes more DVDs like this one, with just the right intensity.",1503705600,,469,4.010752688172043
7222210,5,B00YIZWFQ0,"Great DVD!  If you're looking to get fit, this DVD is it.  Lesliie and her band of merry exercises take you through a warm -up, an introduction to HIIT and a brief higher paced work out.  Don't be discouraged if you're not quite there yet...when I started, I was definitely not there and it took me a few times to get the moves down, but I got it.  She tells you right in the video the moves are not what gets you fit, the pace is.  She also tells you to stay low impact if you can't do the high impact, it's just really a great motivating program and her enthusiasm is contagious.  I was doing a doctor supervised weight loss program when I started this and did this as part of my exercise and the combination helped me lose over 100 pounds.  I've now got all of her HIIT videos.",1502841600,,780,4.125827814569536

7222216,5,B00YIZWFQ0,"This video was a lot of fun! When it says ""all time favorites"" it's referring to the oldies, people who are expecting new songs maybe disappointed. The music features the Temptations and chubby Checker just to give you an idea of the song era. I Felt like I got more out of the exercise than the other two HIIT DVDs.  Everybody seemed happy and really had a good time filming this.  This DVD is a bit longer than the other two, this is a bout 50 minutes to reach your 3 miles with a few extra minutes for a cool down and stretch. If you have limitations with movement because of ankle knee or hip issues this may not be for you  because you will be modifying most of the time you are exercising. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this and look forward to doing it again tomorrow.",1499385600,,778,4.139072847682119
7222217,5,B00YIZWFQ0,"Great workout.  I like how genuinely happy everyone seems while doing the workout.  I actually do this workout in my barefeet, and I do just fine.  It's a great way to wake up in the morning.  Although I don't have quite enough room to move the full range as shown, I modify with slightly smaller steps.  I've only been working out with this DVD for a week or so, and already my legs feel stronger and more muscular.  I have trouble with the dance steps, so I have to slow the pace down there.  It's good for the brain to learn new moves, so I just keep trying.",1499126400,,561,4.138888888888889
7222218,5,B00YIZWFQ0,I have been walking to Leslie Sansone DVDs for many years and this right now is my absolute favorite!  I love HIIT training and this DVD has finally broken through my plateau.  Love the new moves and the upbeat music.,1498521600,,217,4.4

7222244,4,B00YIZWFQ0,I own several of her videos and this is my favorite.  I like the music and the pace is more suited to my fitness level.  I primarily use these videos when it is too cold outside (I live in Montana) for me to run.  One thing I do not care for is her jibber jabber during the videos.  One of hers has the ability to turn that off but still listen to the music.  Adding it to this video would earn it 5 stars.,1486166400,,406,3.7857142857142856

You feel as though you get a good workout but do not feel extremely tired at the end.  I do not normally exercise, but my doctor prescribed that I start due to some issues with arthritis.  This really helps!  Starts my day off right, and now I have that burst of energy I needed during the day.  I highly recommend this video.

This one is her best yet  It is lively and fun and a really good workout!!  I have also become a plant based dietary vegan, which has also played a HUGE part in this transformation.  I am currently not eating any animal products or bi-products (see Forks over Knives - DVD) and for the last couple weeks I have been alternating this workout with Jari Love's Get Ripped.  I feel fantastic.  I keep telling my husband (who has not yet joined me on my journey) that I plan on going out of this world kicking, not in a wheel chair or on a walker.

7222338,2,B00YIZWFQ0,"I've owned TONS of Leslie videos over the years - this is far and away the hardest one to follow.  I bought through Amazon video to play through the Roku so I don't know if I have a download issue or the sound is truly horrible but the music is way too loud.  I had to turn the volume up full blast to hear Leslie's voice and of course that made the music that much louder.

The cues in this one are horrible.  Half the time she acts like she forgot what she was going to do and when she was going to do it. I lost count of the number of times she switched her legs for no apparent reason.  She was talking so much that she got lost on what leg was on the beat then she would just switch.  Very much annoyed me the whole time.

This is a decent workout - my issues are with her and the sound quality, not the workout itself.  But I paid $10 to download this from Amazon and b/c the sound is bad and her voice so low, I won't be able to play this one again.

Overall pretty disappointed in the quality.",1465948800,2,1001,3.8916256157635467

7222396,4,B00YIZWFQ0,"The music is old-school, :-) The Temptations and such. I like it because I'm familiar with it from my much-younger days! I'm in my early-mid 40's, 5'3"", 125lbs, and do about 5-6 hrs of exercise/weight-lifting per week. It's a good aerobic workout. I'm more into weight-lifting, but I did get used to the pace of this after about a month. I intensify it by carrying 2 lb weights, doing jumping jacks and jumping scissors during some of the moves (like the forward/backward sidesteps. I don't like those; they seem to bring my heart rate down too much), and doing side-steps as more of a faster side-skip. I find the use of her group and energy as being very motivating, especially on those days I'm not much in the mood to be jumping around! LOL I sometimes use her first mile (without added intensity) as a warm-up to lifting or the more intense biking that I do. I do like her group of people; varying ages and body types. Leslie does sound a bit chicken-like with her ""walk-walk-walk-walk,"" as my family likes to tease, but I think she's fun. She's happy and it shows! Oh!

Update. ...
Ok, so I have now done this work out a few more times and I'm really beginning to like it!
Doing the twist is so fun and I love the song.
Plus the people on the dvd really seem to be having fun dancing.  I like the fact that they all switch places.

I find this workout to be okay as far as the movement and exercise but it becomes annoying because the music is very hard to hear and I find myself getting out of step. I like enthusiasm but there's also quite a bit of showboating with one or two of the participants so I try to look for people who are just working hard and keeping to the beat which helps me to stay on track and to  keep my concentration.  Next time I'll try it with music only which is a nice feature of the dvd. All in all it makes me sweat and that's what I'm after.

There aren't too many hard moves, which works for someone who is not coordinated like myself.

Both my sister and I have seen results from just 30 minutes a day doing Leslie's workout DVDs. I'm really excited to keep using them and get down to my ideal weight.

Leslie is her usual perky and motivational self, and though she does interact some with the ""cast,"" it isn't too much.  The other walkers are a combination of old and new faces, and they are all very enthusiastic and energized (Nick, as usual, amazes me with his perfect form).  I personally loved the music, and it didn't bother me that it was a combination of oldie hits and ""canned"" music.  I liked the HIIT intervals, and there were some new moves here and there that I had not done before.  I feel like I work the hardest when I'm doing this particular DVD (compared to others of Leslie's), and yet it's the one that I enjoy the most.  Also, there is more upper body work (arms, especially) on this DVD than on some of Leslie's other workouts, which is a plus for me.",1457481600,8,945,4.245810055865922

I tried this for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised how much the music got me invested in the workout, and enjoying it much more than average. The HIIT intervals were done well, so that you don't have to do the full impact version, but can still do a light jog without putting much impact on your joints, which made it something I could actually do.

7222438,5,B00YIZWFQ0,I enjoy exercising to this DVD.  It is challenging and invigorating. I've been exercising for over 10 years and needed a dvd that is more challenging. I feel great when I complete the workout. My only caution is the HIT ( high intensity) segments. I have arthritis in my knees and can not jog or jump. During these segments I do fast walking. The beauty of exercising at home is that you can make modifications as needed.,1456790400,,421,4.467532467532467

7222492,5,B00YIZWFQ0,"I have 10 Leslie Sansone WALK dvds so far and all of them are serving certain purposes for my daily exercise.  First I must give a huge thanks to Leslie for with the combination of dedicated regular use of her dvds along with a healthy diet I have lost 20 pounds in 4 months.  This one is definitely meant for the advanced walker.  It is hard to make the steps smaller to make it for a beginner or intermediate.  This one starts off strong and continues to the end.  This also has the HIIT training intervals and with the other 2 dvds where she utilizes HIIT she slows down a lot before the boosts.  Not here - you will be exercising at a real good pace and suddenly she will announce a boost.  I love it.  This dvd is perfect at combining the passion and personality of Leslie to full effect.  Who the other walkers are in each video matters to me.  I have my favorites and they certainly help boost my enthusiasm even more.  My favorite in any video is Nick.  Being a guy, it helps me a lot to have another man to follow.  He is personable, funny and the perfect person for me to use in following his form with each step.  My goal in each video is to keep up with him and his high fitness level.  The only thing I can't do is the knee lifts like him.  He loves to show off his quads in high step.  Leslie has such fun with him.  Following Nick for me is like having my own professional trainer.  This dvd is the one I use when I want an energetic all out fat burning 3 mile walk.  Her moves are infectious and I have so much fun while getting an excellent workout.

Leslie says that 2,000 steps equals I mile and each time I do this dvd I average 6,300 steps and 370 calories.  A great workout indeed.  I am 54 and when I was in my 30s did regular full on aerobic dvds.  I then had some issues with my knees.  Nothing serious but physical therapy was necessary and the regular aerobic dvds just put too much emphasis and weight on the knees.  I was so grateful to discover Leslie.  I can do all her workouts and get excellent full body action and an excellent burn without burdening my knees.  I am forever thankful to her and all her fellow walkers.  They are like family.  It's a pleasure knowing when I put in the dvd that Leslie, Nick and all the others will be there.  I highly recommend this dvd and just want to remind you it is for the advanced walker.",1450569600,24,2362,4.125274725274726
7222493,5,B00YIZWFQ0,Got me sweat and been doing her walk-exercises for many years but this one is a bit different with varieties of new moves that leave my body unexpected. Love this one.,1449964800,,167,4.419354838709677

I feel like she and I are old friends. I own and love all of the Walk to the Hits DVDs!  I rotate them along with a few others that are 4 or 5 mile DVDs each day. I think that this one is more challenging right from the start. The pace seems faster and the workout more intense over the other two Walk to the Hits DVDs. It's a fun workout. I love that Leslie includes her group of walkers in conversation and fun throughout the workout. I highly recommend this one, but if you are new to her program then I recommend starting with one of the other Walk to the Hits DVDs until you build up stamina.",1449792000,5,773,4.0855263157894735

This one is ok, but it isn't like the other HIITs in the respect that the others slow down before going into the ""boost"" moves. I understand the concept of HIIT is that you slow down your heart rate, then bring it back up, then back down etc. This DVD is pretty high energy most of the way through. It is a good workout though. Also, I don't like the music on this one. I only recognized 2 or 3 of the songs, and they aren't very good remixes (except ""The Twist"" is ok).",1446336000,2,579,4.178571428571429
7222503,5,B00YIZWFQ0,"I love when I find one of Leslie Sansone's Walk to the Hits videos. It means it is usually a higher calorie burn video. This one does not disappoint. The hint for what type of video this is is in the title. It is a HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) video. You do spurts of exercise at a normal pace and then you do spurts of exercise at a higher pace, hence the word HIIT. I have just about every HIIT video she has ever made and they are the ones I just about always turn to. The music is upbeat so you can keep pace with Leslie and her workout crew. The video will definitely keep your heart rate up so you burn more calories. There is always a warm up and a cool down with her videos. I would definitely recommend this product.",1446163200,,736,4.082758620689655

My legs were on fire but the recovery and the stretch helped. I will buy the video and add it to my other HITS video. I think there is another one so I can't wait to try that too.

7222555,3,B00YIZWFQ0,"I have all of Leslie Sansone's DVDs and enjoy this type of exercise immensely but, once again, the music here is uninspired.  Other than 4  hit songs  the rest of the DVD is filled with boring canned synthesizer beats that do little to pump you up and keep you enthused.  The first mile which lasts about 17 minutes has one recognizable song (Get Ready by the Temptations).  Mile Two also has only one recognizable song  (The Twist) while Mile Three has two recognizable songs:  Ain't Too Proud to Beg and Knock on Wood. Overall, from a time perspective, there  is way more generic music (which isn't very good at all) than hit music.  For example, at the end of mile 2, you've worked out 34 minutes but have only heard about 10 minutes of recognizable music.  The other 24 minutes have been canned boring synthesizer music.  As far as canned exercise music, the older black background workout videos had way better music and I find myself reaching for them over this newer one.

The lack of good music keeps me from reaching for this DVD more often.  Leslie Sansone's moves are easy  and doable but can quickly become boring if there isn't good background music to keep you feeling entertained.  Walk to the Hits All Time Favorites just doesn't deliver in the music department.  As far as the workout, she keeps a good pace throughout, unlike the other two Walk to the Hits which I felt slowed down way too much in between intervals.

For me, music can make or break a workout.  On this DVD it breaks it.  On Leslie's Facebook page, she posted a 1 mile workout to commemorate National Walking Day.  It's a great workout!  There are three songs:  Happy by Pharell Williams, Shake it Off by Taylor Swift, and I Feel Good by James Brown.  The mile flies by and I love every minute of it.  I so wish she would do DVDs with hit music.  I don't mind if the songs are  covers and I realize there are copyright issues with $$$ involved but I'd gladly pay more for exercise DVDs with awesome music.",1443312000,46,1990,4.4735376044568245
7222556,5,B00YIZWFQ0,"I have been working out with Leslie for a few months now. I have done several of her other DVDs and I can't get enough of the music on this one!

Leslie is great at offering a full body walking based workout. It's based on the ""HIIT"" system which is high intensity interval training. So you can expect several pops of heavy cardio with a lot of lesser intense but constant movement. It's easy to modify moves to make them either easier or more difficult. She is so much fun to walk and dance with and I love all of her fellow exercisers in the studio.

I find that this particular video, when compared with some of her others, doesn't offer quite as many arm moves. It does, however, really amp up the cardio. I would recommend a separate arm workout on the days you do this video so you can really good a well rounded workout. Throwing in some abs might be a good idea too!",1443225600,,874,4.227544910179641

I would love to see Leslie put out a video using only popular music like Richard Simson did in the 80's rather than selecting one or two well-known songs and using them so sparingly.  Most of the music is still workout music instead of the good stuff.  One other thing:  some of her video menus give the option of listening to the music only and not having to listen to the chatter she adds.

Yes I was sweaty and  today I am  sore  but it is  definitely a  keeper and I would  recommend  it  to  anyone  who  wants to kick it  up a  notch and  add something different  to there  walk at  home routine. I workout  on carpet so I may have  to modify the  twist but all in all its a calorie burning workout. Thank you Leslie .,1441670400,,670,4.016129032258065

I especially love grapevine and mambo combo.  Leslie is bubbly and upbeat which motivates me.  She has several walkers I'm familiar with and she's added a couple new walkers.  Everyone looks like they're having a great time.  This exercise DVD really makes me sweat (most of hers don't.)  When I'm done, I feel I've accomplished quite a work-out.

I've been walking consistently with Leslie's DVDs for almost 4 years now - ever since I had gastric bypass.  When I first started exercising to her DVDs I couldn't even do back kicks (hamstring curls) - in fact, I couldn't even do a full mile!  When I can get through a 3-5 mile DVD now, I'm amazed - and so thankful.  Now that the daylight hours are shorter, she's great during the fall/winter months, as I do my workouts first thing in the morning.  I love the new variety in her newer DVDs - new music, new cast, new moves.  The only thing I would like to see is some older people - I'm 50, and it would be great to see some people more my age doing these workouts.

It seemed like a time filler move and over done. Few kickbacks ..actually I think none were on this DVD. The bounce was on this DVD and again a bit over done. This had no weight training on it and that makes it less intense, less calorie burn. It was ok if you want a decent workout when you're tired after work but you will not burn a lot with this workout if you are use to harder workouts.

I just remember thinking: shouldn't there be several recognizable full songs here? I don't care, it's still a good workout.

These HIITS tapes help me enjoy my passion while getting fit.  Now that I no longer enjoy the bar and party scenes, I can dance in the privacy of my living room while getting a good workout.  These tapes are just right for me.  The transitions from lower to higher intensity work very well, the cast is really fun to watch, and the music works.

7222690,4,B00YIZWFQ0,"This is my 12th Leslie DVD, and my 3rd HIIT.  I enjoy her workouts, and I do them almost every day.  Unlike her first two HIIT workout DVDs, which include a slowed-down pace followed by a quick burst of high intensity for each HIIT cycle, this workout is at a brisk pace throughout.  The HIIT cycles here are not preceded by a ""gentle walk"" - they go from brisk to more brisk with very brief periods of ""recovery"" (8 to 20 heel digs) within each cycle. Four rounds of squats are included, as well are more arm movements than usual and a prolonged session of dancing the twist.  It's a good 55-minute workout.  My Fitbit clocked 6850 steps, 3.28 miles, and 353 calories burned.  I modified the twists and bounces to increase their intensity.  The music is disappointing.  Just 4 Motown songs, and the rest is generic workout music that has no connection to Motown or hits of any kind.",1439164800,4,883,4.475
7222691,5,B00YIZWFQ0,"THE most awesome walk to date! This HIIT walk is different from her other two, Party Songs and Radio ReMixes, the intervals are timed a bit differently. A fun and doable 3 mile walk with some new moves! Yes, some new moves! Like quadruple side steps and a squat and kick move, also some new arm moves! Just a fun workout and great music!",1439164800,5,337,4.28125
7222692,4,B00YIZWFQ0,"It's definitely different from her other Walking to the Hits videos.  The first time I put it on, I turned it off half way through because I just couldn't get into it at all.  I put it back on again a couple days later and did it all the way though, still not sure about it.  Did it for a 3rd time today and this time I really feel I got quite a bit out of it.  Actually, it did more for me than her other Hits videos do, and I really really like those.

I was able to burn 442 calories, my heart rate stayed up and my fitbit counted it at 2 miles, 4,462 steps (it always counts less mileage than the videos advertise because fitbit doesn't recognize all the moves as steps).  Compared to the other Hits videos, this was 104 calories and 894 steps more than I get with the other videos.

My least favorite part was doing the Twist.  I felt awkward doing it for the whole time the video does.  Instead, I just did some extra kicks, sidesteps and power walked. There are a couple of other parts in the video that I can see being challenging to people with some physical limitations but it is really easy to just modify the movements to something that is doable.  I have tile floor and can't always do the bouncing she does, so I do it for a few seconds then switch back to the power walking.

Overall, it's definitely good enough to add to my rotation.  I didn't like it at first, but I'm coming around.  If you are wanting a video that only does the same 4 basic steps and you power walk only the whole time, then this video is not for you.  If you are looking for something to start your fitness routine with and use it as a stepping stone for building endurance then try it.  It will be hard at first because of the added elements to the walk, but it's really worth it when you finish it.",1439078400,84,1789,4.100574712643678

At one point, it seemed as though my heart rate was very elevated.  Also, you will get very sweaty.  Leslie says this at the beginning.  I didn't really believe it, but I had to take a shower afterwards.  So, to me, this is not the type of workout that you could do if you had to leave your house in a hurry afterwards.  All in all, it was a good DVD.",1438905600,3,469,3.978494623655914

I thought this video would be just like her other two walk to the hits videos.  It was definitely different.  It was very upbeat and a lot of fun.  I definitely worked up a sweat.  There are some new twists on some of her moves so you don't feel like you are doing the same things over and over again.  The cast is very upbeat and motivating.  I really enjoyed this one more than I even thought I would.,1438819200,4,525,4.078431372549019

It is different from Radio Hits but still uses High Intensity Interval Training. Songs on this one include Knock on Wood, Ain't Too Proud to Beg, Get Ready, and The Twist.  During the Twist segment she has you Twist however you like.  I liked that as I could do my own version.  She does a lot of the basic moves, side steps, kickbacks, knee lifts etc.  Also has some variations on squats, such as squatting and kicking alternate legs of the way up, or twisting upper body on way up etc.  Mambo and Skater moves are also in this one as well as some backstroke arm movements and some bouncing.  I felt it was a fun workout and a dancier version of a workout but I think that is what made it fun.",1438732800,9,941,4.126373626373627
7222696,5,B00YIZWFQ0,"This brand new Leslie Sansone dvd was released yesterday and since I have Amazon prime, it was delivered last night! I did the entire dvd this morning so I could post my review.

5 min warm up
14 mins of mile 1
14 mins of mile 2
17 mins of mile 3
2 mins of cool down
3 mins of stretching
*55 minutes from start to finish with this dvd*

Leslie had her traditional walking moves; along with kickbacks, mambo combos, and lots of heel digs. She also had some new moves like backstrokes, squat & kick, squat & reach, squat & twist, and twisting.
The twisting could be hard on the knees so I personally would suggest just walking or jogging in place to keep it low impact.

She also does some HIIT training intervals which involved jogging up and back, and bouncing in place. Again, if you have knee problems, I would suggest jogging instead of bouncing. There are no jumping jacks in this one like some of her other HIIT interval dvds.

Leslie had a lot of cast members for this workout, including some regulars-Nick, Marvin and Carrie.

The music was fun and upbeat using classic hit songs-nothing modern.

Family friendly with no bad language in the songs or immodest clothes.

I would consider this dvd more moderate, but a beginner could certainly do it and just modify some of the twisting and bouncing movements.
Overall, I really enjoyed this dvd! The cast, music and new movements were a lot of fun.  I have been using Leslie Sansone dvds for almost 4 years now and truly enjoy them.  My heart rate typically stays in the 120s and 130s which is great for FAT BURN!

I post reviews on my healthy and fitness blog (www. EmpowerMoms.net) and love to try new fitness dvds. I purchased this dvd-all opinions are my own.",1438732800,112,1718,4.460063897763578
7222697,5,B00YIZWFQ0,"There was one worry I had with this, and it was that I feared it was just going to be a copycat of her Walk To The Hits Radio Mixes & Party Songs. It's not. This one is a little more high intensity and structured differently. Many of her original moves have been modified. So, she has you doing plenty of new things.

Menu Screen:
Play All 3 Miles (with music only option)
Play Mile 1 (with music only option)
Play Mile 2 (with music only option)
Play Mile 3 (With Music only option)

Mile 1:
Leslie is in a room with a lot of people to where you can barely see Carrie in the back left corner.  But there are only about four new faces consisting of twins on the left, and two other new women on the right. There's really no difference in people from her last DVD she released (Tone Every Zone Walk). She introduces everyone when she normally does way at the end.

Of course you have your warm-up, and then a song called Temptations comes on. There is bouncing with an arm swing, kind of like the old sixties style dance. And that was the tone I felt in this DVD, that she was trying to get us in the old fashion style of music. Yes, it's fun.

The HIT interval is different. Unlike in her other Walk To the Hits, the HIT is only of one interval. But it feels like it lasts about 2 to 3 minutes. All you do is jog up four and jog in place for four and then job back for four. In between that, she'll have you do heels as a small recovery, and then the jogging starts back up again. There's only ONE HIT interval in Miles 1 and 2.

Mile 2:
This Mile is indeed the hardest. It had my heart rate up really high then I was actually comfortable with, and my calves were burning. I did feel some midsection burning as well. She does A LOT of bouncing and twisting in this one. There's a stand-and-squat move. A sit-and-kick move as well. One thing I did like was when everybody did the freestyle twists, the people actually moved to a different spot, which was cool becuase I always have my favorites such as Marvin, Nick, and Carrie. It just gave us the chance to see some people better. I think for each mile she'll introduce one oldies song. Somebody correct me if I'm wrong becuase I hardly recognized anything.

Mile 3:
This mile was a little more pleasant, but will still have you moving about quickly. She'll have you do some mambo moves, a squat and twist move and some more bouncing. Some of her moves remind me of her Belly Blasting Walk DVD, which is REALLY good for your abs.

The Cool down was a little rushed, but that's to be expected. I burned about  434 calories through the whole thing. I REALLY enjoyed this workout. The Music was not terrible at all, and it was nicely leveled with her voice. She does get off step a little. There is no time clock. Again, this one was higher intensity. So, if you have bad knees, Just be low impact becuase it's a lot of bouncing and SOME squatting.
