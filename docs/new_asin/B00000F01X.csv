7906126,5,B00000F01X,It's a all time favorite of mine love how the two young men stick together and the beat the odds against them!!,1469923200,,111,4.090909090909091
7906127,5,B00000F01X,"I first saw this film years ago.  I liked it.  Then I saw ""The Making Of"" featurette and was impressed 10x over.  I am a filmmaker myself, and have a huge appreciation for what these people created and how they went about it.  I have been suggesting it to friends and colleagues in the independent film world ever since.  I just recently purchased this copy to enjoy it again.  Rocco is not just another boob who made just another indie.  He played the hand he was dealt, overcame barriers, thought outside the box, and took serious risks to make an indie action film on par with the big boys.",1370822400,,593,4.385321100917431

7906129,1,B00000F01X,A film of pure PC propoganda. This film deserves nothing more than ZERO stars.,1096588800,,78,4.642857142857143

OK, so the movie itself is not exactly stunning...  Fairly  predictable plot, low budget obviously showing.  Again, not a particularly stunning movie, UNTIL you watch the ""Making of"" bit.
Suddenly the movie IS stunning - in an amazing way - when you see what they ALL went through to make it happen.  This DVD is worth buying or renting if only to watch the ""Making Of.""  These guys are all things to all actors.  Film Crew members doubling as hair stylists, producer/director doubling as stunt men (and WHAT stunts they are!!), actor's first time equine experience being a high speed horse chase, pyro-techs raiding their dads christmas tree light collections.  What other movie have you seen where the film crew borrows a neighborhood horse and paints it black, shoots the cop chase scenes with a cop car chasing a guy on a bicycle through downtown and then runs like hell before the REAL cops show up, has to replace horses because after a few days on the set they learn what the word ACTION means and they start freaking out during the scene, and the stunt men crash cars with only pillows tied to their chests and the directors coat put on backwards, and oh yeah, films river rapids swim shots in JANUARY in Idaho!
The director is arrested and jailed for speeding in some small town he can't even remember, and is bailed out buy some guy who bails him in exchange for putting his son on the production crew.
These guys are an absolute RIOT!
This is definately worth a look just for the Making Of.  These guys have made a film they will ALL remember as fondly as marines do of their boot camp days.
One other comment: I'm really not sure why this movie is rated R.  It looks like it could pass for PG-13.  perhaps it is the racial tension and use of the ""n"" word.
Not at all offensive, really, and I plan to let my younger teen kids watch the movie.",1001808000,8,1899,4.446685878962536
