2858436,5,B000R5OFPO,"I watched Degrassi Junior High complete box set about six times and I just bought it this summer. I couldn't wait until the Degrassi High came out on DVD. I just received it last night and my husband gave it to me as I walked in the door from school. I'm taking an accelerated degree program and really haven't any time to watch these DVD's but I will have to steal a half an hour here and their. I was in my early 20's when I used to watch Degrassi on PBS, and was hooked by the innocence of the their problems and the horrible clothes and hair styles they had. The whole non-actor thing and the quaint cheesiness of their raw acting were just so adorable you had to keep watching it. Enjoy!!!!!",1192060800,2,696,4.201492537313433
2858437,5,B000R5OFPO,"I honestly gave up hope of seing the release of Degrassi High on dvd since it's been a few years the dvd release of Degrassi Junior High. & honestly it made me happy & preorder it,cause Degrassi High went very farther on life lessons & facts than Degrassi Junior High. & School's Out went farther than both series put together which will be included on the dvd release.
Damn i'm so glad that these tv dramas are being release & more cause I grew watching them. Buyers...you won't regret getting this dvd set!!!
I recomend it 100%",1184025600,,529,4.463917525773196

2858463,4,B000R5OFPO,"Preferable over Degrassi: The Next Generation. Neither ideal nor fatalistic like ""The Wonder Years"" and ""My So-Called Life"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"" after it. I have to admit it: Alexa annoys me with her pre-meditated drama; Wheels disappoints me with his decline (though that happens to a lot of kids in high school and over); and it seems like Kathleen hardly lightens up. However, when you're young, you go far out of your way to be better than you can. The mere thought of rejection or failure or loss shakes you up. And the only truth of youth is the grown-up consequences. They sneak up every time, leaving three choices: throw it away like Claude; slack off and curse alas like Wheels, Luke, and Dwayne (until he re-evaluates himself following his HIV diagnosis); or keep on moving like Joey, Snake, Lucy, Caitlin, Arthur, and Spike. Teachers, like Mr. Raditch and Miss Avery, stay their professional course. No sloppy, disturbing entanglements attached. (I was glad to see the former show up in the first episode, by the way). Don't bother with Next Generation; get DEGRASSI HIGH. It's more authentic.",1448496000,,1107,4.8936170212765955
2858464,5,B000R5OFPO,Intentionally bought this set because the next generation came out when I was a preteen. The older character sparked my curiousity enough to watch the originals. My fiance is from canada and I ordered another set for my mother in-law because she loves this whole series. (Not to mention she grew up on these.) it's dated and quality it pretty good depending on your player. Delivery took a week but great seller. No complaints and would buy again.  All in all I got to catch up on the whole plot and fairly enjoyed this set for being in my early 20s. :) ps. Caitlin Ryan is my favorite character because of the later show.,1448323200,,622,4.456140350877193

2858466,5,B000R5OFPO,"The gang is back and off to a high school for a whole new set of teenage dilemmas. Various topics are covered in this season ranging from abortion to inter-racial dating as well as domestic abuse and battling leukemia. There are also a lot of less intense scenarios like teenage crushes and having to take driver's education classes. I think we can all relate to the lighter topics presented, but the more serious stories are easy to identify with and are presented well.",1446336000,,471,4.686746987951807
2858467,5,B000R5OFPO,Awesome!,1445558400,,8,8.0
2858468,5,B000R5OFPO,I love this show! Its too bad that the episodes are only about half an hour long because there are so many characters but so much they can show in so little time. The shows main characters I would say are Caitlyn and Joey since most of the episodes focus on them but I must say they are the two best characters in the show. There are some other characters I really like such as Spike and Kathleens character. I felt like they could have done more episodes on them overall this show is really good I definetly recommend.,1444867200,,519,4.252525252525253
2858469,5,B000R5OFPO,"This show was ahead of its time. I cannot say enough about how wonderful I felt watching this show. Abortion, suicide, heartbreak, and death are all topics that make for great TV. Thank you Canada for this amazing contribution to society",1443139200,,237,4.804878048780488

2858473,5,B000R5OFPO,"The kids from Degrassi Junior High are back for two more seasons, this time as high school students. Most of the previous cast members are back in their respective roles, and it was nice to see these non-actors (most had no prior acting experience before they were cast in Degrassi Junior High) maturing into their roles and bringing a greater level of credibility to their roles. I grew up watching this show and it has stood the test of time: the clothes and hair may change, but the issues dealt with remain the same.

In this first season of Degrassi High, the kids are starting high school at a new school. The themes dealt with this season are varied: dating violence, (another) teen pregnancy, abortion, break-ups, divorce, teens forced to make adult decisions, and more. One of the characters, Kathleen (Rebecca Haines), is one that tugs at the heartstrings. She is generally an unsympathetic character as she is such a straight-laced, pompous person with little sympathy for others troubles, but she has so much baggage and over the course of the show, I really began to warm to her  she has an alcoholic mother, battles an eating disorder, and then gets involved with a boy who physically abuses her. This is just one of the story arcs that is explored in this engrossing series, and makes Degrassi High an evergreen show that will appeal to many, despite its age.",1439251200,2,1374,4.7447698744769875

I LOVE THIS SHOW SO MUCH AS A KID!

Watching this show sent me back to my junior high yrs.

the show had issues that are still relevant for today's kids.  Granted, what's missing is social media, cell phones, etc.  but the core, the meat of the shows are still relevant.

I think everyone should plop their kids down to watch the whole series b/c there was always good lessons in every show to be learned.",1433289600,,477,4.2555555555555555

2858493,4,B000R5OFPO,"This was my favorite show when I was a kid, and having worn out the VHS tapes of the series also purchased on Amazon some years back, I was happy to get the series on DVD, which is among other things far less expensive than the VHS set. The only issue I've had is the occasional freezing or slowing of a scene here and there, but it seems easily resolves by restarting the episode. So far I've not experienced discs or episodes that won't play, though I have encountered this with other series sets, so it appears we've dodged a bullet there and quality control was up to par here. Highly recommended  to those who grew up in the 80s. The cost of entry is worth it just to lay eyes on Spike again, who I was absolutely in love with back then...

I'm the sort of dork that loves After School Specials type shows and Degrassi is by far the best one, I've ever come across. It touches on so many issues that kids go through, even in todays day and age. Not to mention how fun it is to watch these kids grow up and some even continue on to further seasons as adults. I highly recommend it for your kids, it teaches some great values and they might just learn from them. I know, I did. It's fun for parents too.

2858522,4,B000R5OFPO,"My wife and I enjoy watching this program.  The acting is convincing for such a young cast and although the content is somewhat contrived, the issues the show tackles are handled genuinely, not simplistically.  The message is not ""preachy"" as a lot of shows geared toward youth can be.  The characters are three dimensional, each with flaws, some of which that are by choice, and frequently natural consequences follow a character's mistakes.

2858533,4,B000R5OFPO,"I have been a Degrassi fan since I used to watch the show after school as a youngster.  I recently bought all of the seasons and have been slowly savoring each episode over the last few months.  I've enjoyed almost all of them, but there was one thing about this set that really disappointed me.  That thing would be the final bonus video ""School's Out!""  Most of the film centered on Joey ""getting laid"" and was rather explicit to me.  The profanity (f***, s***...) was particularly offensive.  All of the dramatic story lines crammed into one movie also seemed really over-the-top.  What are the odds that all of those major events would happen to one graduation class over one summer?  That was just my personal reaction.

Anyway, the reason I always enjoyed this show in the past is because there was no swearing or explicit junk.  And even though the shows dealt with serious subject material, it was always handled in an even-handed, realistic manner.  That wasn't true of ""School's Out!""  It was as if the writers dumped everything that made ""Degrassi"" so popular and opted for the shock value, low road instead.

So, I absolutely hated the bonus video.  It was a massively disappointing capstone to such a great series.  Aside from that, however, all of the other episodes are great fun to watch.  I still plan to keep this set as the other episodes are worth seeing; however, I will definitely avoid ever watching the ""School's Out!"" bonus video again.",1371081600,,1461,4.738095238095238

Sure, Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High are cheesy, but I think it's a great series because it shows us 90s+ kids how junior high/high school kids back in the 80s dealt with the same issues that junior high/high school students still deal with today.",1358380800,,544,4.45

Many of the themes of this show stand the test of time and are still relevant today.  (ok minus the clothing, music, hairstyles, and cars lol).",1237680000,,352,4.0
2858551,5,B000R5OFPO,"I'll never forget how in the late '80s, I would end each day with a snack in front of the TV, while taking in another episode of the educational teenage soap opera ""Degrassi High"" on PBS. The show's school bell would ring and that endlessly addictive pop theme song would begin, meaning the start of another great show.

Each episode would look at a single problem or issue, that confronted teenagers in our modern society. This included discussions about a variety of topics including drugs, abortion, homosexuality, teen suicide, AIDS, phyiscal/sexual abuse and women's rights. The show takes place in a fictional Canadian high school and shows teens from from all walks of life, ethnicity and social groups. Each episode features an issue, while weaving together in a soap opera-ish style, the interests, problems and relationships of the large cast.

This includes the enterprising yet underachieving, Joey Jermiah (Pat Mastroianni), the caring and concerned, Caitlin (Stacie Mistysin), young teen mother, Spike (Amanda Stepto), the feminist, Lucy (Anias Gronofsky), the twins Heather & Erica (Maureen & Angela Deiseach), the troubled orphan, 'Wheels' (Neil Hope) and his best friend 'Snake' (Stephan Brogan). These are just a few among many characters in the series. The adults in their world include their strict principal, Mr. Raditch (Dan Williams) and the always caring dream of a teacher, Ms. Avery (Michelle Goodeve).

'Degrassi High' (seasons 4-5) is basically a sequel to the series known as 'Degrassi Junior High' (Seasons 1-3). The kids are now older. Their lives, social relationships and problems are much more mature and complex. Certain characters such as Joey, Caitlin, Spike, Michelle, Dwayne, Heather & Erica, Lucy, Snake and Wheels proved to be popular characters, who the writers have given a lot of the screen time and story arcs to. This includes multi-episode stories, that deal with controversial subjects and stories (WARNING SPOILERS!!) such as Erica getting an abortion, Caitlin's boyfriend, Claude, committing suicide and Dwayne (Shorty) becoming HIV positive.

I find, that the longer the 'Degrassi' Series ran, the better it got. Both the writing and the acting were vastly improved in comparison to the 'Junior High' episodes. To me this DVD box set includes some of the best episodes produced in the entire series. The thing about this show is that its' both endlessly entertaining and addictive. It's like eating a bag of potato chips. You just just can't stop! Trust me you will get hooked! Highly recommended!

(One note: This DVD set also includes as an 'Extra', the hour and a half 'Degrassi' movie, ""School's Out!"", which I think is a much more of a satisfying (and explicit!) goodbye to some of our favorite 'Degrassi' characters, than the last episode, ""One Last Dance"".)",1222992000,12,2815,5.2052980132450335

2858554,5,B000R5OFPO,"Before I purchased the complete high school collection I had all three seasons of junior high which I was more familiar with.  I had watch the junior high episodes in a ""life skills"" class when I was in junior high.  In high school I caught a few of the high school year episodes on Canadian television and have loved the show ever since.

The high school complete collection is really great to have since I got so hooked on the characters in their junior high years it is nice to see them finish high school, it gives the fans some closure.

Anyway, this show is often criticized as over the top by being too dramatic.  Also, the obvious low budget production makes the extremely dramatic story line ackward with sub par acting.  This is something that makes me love the show though.  The characters are ackward and imperfect, kind of like real people.
These ""different"" qualities of Degrassi give it a rougher, more realistic feel without being campy.  I would recommend watching Degrassi beginning in the junior high years.  Once you get invested in the characters you'll want to finish through high school with them.

Also, the bonus of ""School's Out!"" the Degrassi movie on these DVDs is great.",1201392000,4,1199,4.69377990430622

The charcters from the original series are now older and have moved on to high school, and with the characters increased age come more challenging storylines.

This box set contains the two seasons of ""Degrassi High"" along with ""Degrassi: School's Out"" the movie set after the end of these seasons. Season 1 of ""Degrassi High"" focusses primarily on Erica, who falls pregnant but, unlike Spike in ""Degrassi Jr High"", decides to have an abortion; LD, who develops leukemia; and Michelle, who, following her parents' divorce, decides to move out of home. Season 2 shifts the focus to Wheels, who becomes frustrated with his grandparents and is ultimately kicked out of home. As with ""Degrassi Jr High"", as well as dealing with major issues, the writers of ""Degrassi High"" still managed to include enough silly minor storylines to make the series fun. My particular favourite is an episode in which Lucy decides to make a feminist horror movie. The ""Zits""' music video is also a classic.

""Degrassi: School's Out"", set after the gang have graduated from high school, is more serious and less light hearted than the previous episodes. This movie focusses on Joey and Caitlin, who are contemplating marriage, and although I won't give the details, doesn't have a happy ending. At first I found it depressing, and didn't like it, but ultimately I concluded that it was the perfect ending for the series, in that the show had always been about realism and what happens in this movie is definitely realistic.

""Degrassi High"" is one of the greatest teen series of all time and is essential viewing for anyone who enjoyed ""Degrassi Jr High"".",1199750400,,1890,5.532871972318339
