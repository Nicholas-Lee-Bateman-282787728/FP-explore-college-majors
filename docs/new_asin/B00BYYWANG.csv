5683005,5,B00BYYWANG,"I like this movie because its where Lauren comes in. At first i wasn't quite sure if I would like this one or not. I thought Lauren would come in on the first episode. When she didn't, I thought she wouldn't come in at all. I WAS SO WRONG",1375488000,4,238,3.877551020408163
5683006,3,B00BYYWANG,"The artwork is beautiful, but I don't understand why they keep releasing the separate volumes when there's the complete set that's a LOT cheaper. And the special features are the same.",1371600000,5,184,4.967741935483871

8575734,3,B00BYYWANG,"This is advertised to look like a movie lasting 1.5 hours. It is actually just Power Rangers episodes. My children had already seen some of them. They really enjoyed the last episode, but where's the rest of the story!!",1407715200,3,219,4.641025641025641

8575736,5,B00BYYWANG,"Why is there no volume 5 ? Why was the last episode of volume 4the 1st one for the should have been 5th volume ? Also , why would they want us to waist our money on volume four when Lauren Shiba doesn't appear until the very last episode on the disc ? Talk about false advertising .",1399852800,2,282,3.8793103448275863
