8617567,5,B00FP8G38K,Bought this for my 4yr old son. He loves it. He picks sections of it to do and we do it together. Great exercise for the kids. Well narrated and easy to follow for my little guy.,1426636800,,178,3.8378378378378377
8617568,5,B00FP8G38K,I needed a beginner yoga dvd for myself and a fun activity for my over active 3 year old boy.  We both love this set.,1423267200,,117,3.68
8617569,4,B00FP8G38K,The dvd has some great poses but lacks music. I find there should be some background music to complement the poses.,1410912000,,115,4.523809523809524
8617570,5,B00FP8G38K,"I bought this DVD set to use in my preschool class this year. I knew I wanted to incorporate Yoga in our classroom but felt uneasy about being the one to teach it. This DVD set is perfect! I recognize many of the poses but they are presented in a way that totally makes sense to young children. My class especially loves the Once Upon a Mat video. They love taking turns choosing which Yoga adventure we will embark on. Yoga day is a much anticipated day each week and parents have commented that their children ask to do Yoga at home as well.

My preschoolers range from just barely 3 to 4.5 years of age, but my 2 year old son and almost 8 year old daughter enjoy the videos just as much as my preschool class. The videos definitely appeal to a wide variety of ages. I even enjoy doing the poses along with my kiddos!",1409184000,,819,4.1835443037974684
8617571,5,B00FP8G38K,"Each of these kids yoga videos is a full 40-minute yoga class for children, made up of several 3- to 5-minute chapters.  You can either watch the entire video with your child or choose a specific segment (ex. warm up, yoga story, or relaxation) or theme (ex. garden, tropics, or sport).  The videos each feature a different yoga instructor on her yoga mat, against a white background.  There are no distracting backgrounds or colors in these videos, making it perfect for this age group.  The blank background encourages children to use their own imaginations as they follow pretend yoga journeys.

The sequences integrate yoga postures, breathing techniques, positive affirmations (ex. I am confident. or I am adventurous.), and relaxation.  The Parent Info clip offers tips to get the most out of the videos.  The yoga instructor reminds us that kids yoga is not as formal as adult yoga and that creativity is encouraged.  Children might not follow along with the yoga poses while watching for the first time, but they will no doubt join in once they are familiar with the format.

My daughter and I enjoyed the various themes on the Once Upon a Mat video: the garden, the tropics, and the arctic.  Namaste Kid chooses topics that children are interested in and can relate to.  The third video, Sport Yoga, takes children on a journey through acting out their favorite sports.  The variety of themes across the three videos allows you to follow your childs interest on any given day.

I highly recommend Namaste Kid videos to parents or teachers looking for a kids yoga video that promotes movement and storytelling without a distracting background.  These kids yoga videos would be perfect for the winter months, during a rainy spring day, or even during a transition to dinnertime or when changing activities.  In the classroom, these videos would be excellent for short brain breaks or to introduce a new topic.

8617572,5,B00FP8G38K,The moves are simple for my grandkids. I would say 1.2 to 7 years old can enjoy this. It was difficult to see the young lady against the white backdrop but it was well made. Very professional.,1391990400,,192,4.216216216216216
8617573,5,B00FP8G38K,"I couldn't be happier to have found these DVDs for my students!  After reviewing the 3 DVDs for my students, I'm an Early Childhood Special Education Teacher, I found that they were all uniquely different and fun.  The first DVD, Yoga Motion, focuses more on learning the different yoga poses.  The second DVD, Once Upon a Mat, combines yoga poses while encouraging my students to use their imagination while doing the poses.  The third DVD, Sport Yoga, takes sports that are familiar to most of my students and incorporates yoga poses that are similar to those used in the various sports.  Although they are all different, what I enjoy the most is that they are not visually distracting.  It's an adult instructor who is showing accurate yoga poses with nothing else on the screen.  Since many of my students have a very short attention span, I also enjoyed that there is a menu on all the DVDs where you can pick which segment you want to view.  There's no guessing with which section of the DVD had the favorite part.  The other benefit from these DVDs is that it helps my students regulate.  They learn to deep breath, do movements that use both sides of their brain and body, and help to calm them yet expend some energy at the same time.",1390867200,4,1243,4.558558558558558
