4248692,1,B0042AEU6Y,"This film is an example of all that I hate in a poorly made foreign film: boring characters who endlessly talk in the existential sphere (""What is copy? What is real?), tightly filmed shots that give little sense of locale-- but which manage to always maintain a constant focus on the female character's breasts--, and a preoccupation on the act of eating.
The main characters are very serious, very educated, and very boring.
As typical of existential-type films, the female character represents Woman i.e. she who man needs, even if he doesn't know this himself. The man is just an oaf who struggles though life.
It's all a bit much.
But, if you like seeing a woman's bosom throughout a film, this is for you.
If you think the French language makes everything sound deep and enlightened, this is for you.
If you enjoy seeing actors speaking directly to the camera, this is for you.
This film is a forced and indulgent exercise producing nothing.
Thank goodness for 1.5 speed!",1319155200,10,977,4.752941176470588
4248693,4,B0042AEU6Y,"<strong>Copie Conforme</strong> (Abbas Kiarostami, 2010)

Imagine <em>Saw</em> if it had been made by Bla Tarr.

Okay, I know I'm getting even more disbelieving looks than usual here, but let's face it: <em>Copie Conforme</em> is a Big Reveal movie, just as <em>Saw</em> is. Looked at in that regard, the ambiguity that so many people talk about pretty much goes away; there's a mystery to be solved here. The only difference is that it's not the characters who are trying to solve the mystery; they know everything, and because they know everything, they have no reason to explain it to themselves. We, the audience, are trying to work out the relationships here. And Kiarostami is, for most of the film, about as interested as the characters are in helping us work that out; in many of the movie's scenes, in fact, he is consciously obfuscating things, and the way the film is shot makes that all too plain. As to where the Tarr part comes in, aside from Kiarostami's wonderful soundplay and a few shots all to reminiscent of the Hungarian master, Tarr's movies, be they his shorter crime films (e.g., <em>The Man from London</em>) or his longer meditations on the fall of the Soviet Union (e.g., <em>Stntang</em>), the structure of every Tarr film is the same: languid save one moment of unadulterated violence.

The film opens with a talk at a university. Actually, the film opens with with the audience (both in the cinema and on the screen) waiting for a talk at a university. It is to be given by James Miller (William Shimell is his first big-screen appearance), a cultural historian who has wandered into the art world, according to his own later declamations, seemingly by accident. His book, which has the same name as the film, has won some sort of obscure prize, and he's giving the thank-you speech. Or he will, if he ever gets there. (This is important.) He eventually does show up, and launches into his speech, which he gives in a mixture of English and stumbling Italian (I assume it's meant to be stumbling, but I don't have nearly enough knowledge of what Italian is supposed to sound like despite my <em>giallo</em> fetish). As he's getting started, a woman and her son slip in and find their way to the reserved seating. This, we find out later, is Elle (Juliette Binoche), a local antiques dealer. She is unable to stay for the entire lecture, so she slips James' friend, the university professor who introduced him, her number and takes her son Julian (<em>Im Schwitzkasten</em>'s Adrian Moore) for a burger. The two of them have a conversation that seems mundane, but ends up perhaps provoking more thought than anything in the film. In any case, later that morning, Elle presumably gets a call from James, who shows up in her antique shop. She promises to show him something interesting if he's got the time to spare; he replies that he has to be back in time to catch a nine o'clock train. No problem, and they depart Arezzo for Lucignano, which we are told is half an hour away or thereabouts. They see what she has come to show him, but it's after that that things get interesting, as we start to question not the nature of their relationship, but the way Kiarostami has presented their relationship to us.

Not helping the matter is that Kiarostami, who also wrote the script, is involved in constant misdirection as to what the mystery even <em>is</em> (the question I hear most asked, and the one it was easiest to answer by halfway through the film, is ""dis these people know each other before the movie started?""). Again, not that he hides this fact from us at all; this is ""mystery"" in its most existential form, and also again, there's no mystery in the film itself. Everyone there knows what's going on, even the people who have never met these folks before, including the proprietor of a local coffee shop (<em>Tea with Mussolini</em>'s Gianna Giachetti) and an older couple Elle ropes into a discussion on a statue in a little square in Lucignano (<em>La Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie</em>'s Jean-Claude Carrire and <em>Micmacs</em>' Agathe Natanson). In case you haven't noticed, this movie has one hell of a cast, which makes it even more impressive that Shimell, who previously had acted in a few made-for-TV movies, holds his own against them. (Even more impressive is Adrian Moore, whose part is small, but wonderful.) But I digress. Kiarostami is using this to slap us in the face, as it were, with how we simply don't get it. (Don't worry, there's more to this tale than anyone else gets, either.) But the slap, as it did in his wonderful <em>Ta'm e Guilass</em>, comes with a velvet glove. After all, Kiarostami is doing his best to confuse you. Take the beginning of that car ride, while the two of them are still in Arezzo. There's a long, languid conversation, some joking. All the while they're driving through the narrow streets, and you can see the buildings on either side reflected in the windshield. The buildings on either side of the street are different, but constant, colors, so the view of James is always occluded by off-white, whereas the view of Elle is always occluded with a sort of terracotta yellow. (I wish I'd been paying enough attention to be able to make some salient comment on the changes in conversation when they pass into shadow.) This sort of occlusion is present throughout, as we often see the characters through, or in, reflections, both from glass (display cases, picture windows, etc.) and in mirrors. As well, remember I talked about Tarr and soundplay? There are times when we can't hear what James and Elle are saying thanks to the soundplay. The mike will focus on a presenter at a small museum talking about a piece of art, or a traveling accordion player (how Tarr is that?) will pass between the camera and the couple, and we will hear nothing of them, or the people they're talking to.

The mirrors are especially important in a movie where every shot is blocked with importance. While Kiarostami is interested in obfuscation, there's a point where you can't obfuscate any more. Ironically (and meant as such), the two times when our main characters are most naked is a long, stationary shot in a mirror. While I can't say more without spoiling it, the placement of these two shots is perhaps the most important thing in the film for figuring out the mystery (the solution to which is there for all to see in the film's final spoken line, by the way).

The one place it falls just shy of genius is in the conversation Elle has with Julian. Taken on its own, it is an excellent scene, full of the little details that make this movie wonderful. But in the greater context, it serves only to throw confusion onto confusion. It's the one place that Kiarostami's obfuscation becomes manipulation, and the scene--and the film--suffers for it.

Is that a reason not to see it? Of course not. Even Roger Ebert, whose distaste for Kiarostami is legendary (his reaction to <em>Ta'm e Guilass</em> started a friendly rivalry between Ebert and Jonathan Rosenbaum that continues to this day, and the first sentence of his review of <em>Ten</em> is ""I am unable to grasp the greatness of Abbas Kiarostami.""), gave the film three and a half stars, though the text of the review itself strikes me as lukewarm at best (""[f]or me, it is too clever by half, creating full-bodied characters but inserting them into a story that is thin soup.""). This is another way in which Kiarostami reminds me of Tarr: even if you've no idea what's going on, the film is so beautiful, and the characters so intriguing, the movie's worth seeing. But unlike Tarr, whose movies are so often about nothing but the day-to-day life of his characters, Kiarostami does, in fact, have a Big Reveal. It's subtle enough, however, that even people who saw it and half-understood its significance often don't make the (to me obvious) final leap. Give it a shot and see if you hit the bullseye. *** ",1317168000,11,7946,4.740419378163413
4248694,5,B0042AEU6Y,"Note that this review is for the film itself, which I saw in theaters (twice); I'm waiting for the Criterion Edition to ship (May 22) before I pick up my own copy.

An author on tour to promote his book has an apparently chance meeting with a French woman (Juliette Binoche), and their encounter proves to be something far more than casual.  He proposes in his book that a copy, an imitation, is as good as the genuine article, and while he appears to confine his thesis to works of art, what follows suggests that she may be testing to see how far it extends to life itself.  The latest film by celebrated Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami is also his first to be filmed outside of his native country.  Starring Juliette Binoche (who took home the best actress award at Cannes for her stunningly enigmatic performance in this film), Certified Copy starts from a premise that promises an exotic love story, and gradually turns into a subtle and profound meditation on art, memory, truth, and identity.

To give a quick sense of the feel of this remarkable film I might suggest it combines the conversational intimacy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunset/dp/B0002YLC24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunset</a>&nbsp;and the intellectual intrigue of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Year-at-Marienbad/dp/B001WLMOLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Year at Marienbad</a>.  The problem is that comparison makes this seem like a derivative work, that merely copies elements of established works.  It's not.  Like all of the works I've seen by Abbas Kiarostami, this is a true original.  Or if its a copy, it's a genuine copy.  It's a fascinating film, that I've seen twice now, and that I look forward to watching again, since I got even more from it the second time.  It's a densely layered film, where details refer to other details, and each calls up a range of themes and ideas, but where the intellectual intrigue is balanced by an emotional tension and resonance, and that wears its layers lightly, almost as if it were all improvised.  It's both a delightful romance - that might be said to skip the romance, straight to the after of the happily ever after - and a subtle philosophical exploration of a wide range of fascinating themes.

By the way, here's what to expect when the Criterion edition ships:
-a new high-definition digital restoration, with 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition
-a new interview with director Abbas Kiarostami
-""Let's See Copia conforme,"" an Italian documentary on the making of Certified Copy, featuring interviews with Kiarostami and actors Juliette Binoche and William Shimell

4248695,5,B0042AEU6Y,"Well, The Facebook has spoken and apparently it's mating season--your local postalwomen busy heaving wedding invitations by the crateload, priests perched twiddling thumbs while brides cram hundred dollar bills under their doors. If you're married, undivorced, and out to celebrate your semicentenial, you're more or less `alternative' these days. Still, curb your cynicism, please. Is it so reckless and absurd to celebrate the impression of love-everlasting in lieu of the real thing?...and by real thing of course I mean, like, Princess Bride-type love...the stuff that comes pre-certified and guaranteed beyond the breadth of doubt.

No don't worry though, this movie's not a chick flick and that anorexic girl from The Notebook (2004) is nowhere to be seen. James, coy Englishman, is back in Tuscany promoting the new book he's written on aesthetics: Certified Copy--Forget the original... (I'm assuming that the book's subtitle refers to Radiohead's creepy new album cover art) ...and find yourself a good copy. (Yeah don't worry James, I swiped mine on BitTorrent, too) It's here he meets up with the staggeringly attractive Juliette Binoche (Elle, French ex-pat) who conveys him over a Cyprus-studded countryside toward the village of Lucignano where herds of young betrothed are squinting for their formal photos. When a barista with no ear for American, err... English mistakes their erudite flirtation for the nostalgic dialogue of a married couple retracing their young love, Elle gets James to play along. The faade continues and soon it isn't clear: is Elle's exuberance limited to that of a star-struck art history nerd or are we bearing darker witness to the couple's slow identification with some long repressed and bygone love affair?

Sound dull? It's not. I asked the woman hustling popcorn if she had seen it yet. She looked distraught, told me no, and took a little extra time with her non-trans polyunsaturated organic red palm oil-extract butter substitute popcorn condiment as if probing the air for something positive to say. ""The manager said it's not really a film, but like a dialogue?"" Uh-oh, I thought, yet the drama here is twofold. The lovers' ambiguity aside, Elle constructs their fantasy to prove a point: can the experience of celebrating love--well aged and worn--be meaningful to the same degree if re-created to a high enough degree of verisimilitude? Does art only have value in terms of our experience with art--a work's status as authentic or `fake' notwithstanding?

I must have sobered up about the time I realized the dialogue had switched to French, Italian, and back to normal-speak again. Regardless of your state of consciousness, Certified Copy delivers a high sensory-entertainment payoff upon your monetary and/or two-hour investment. Drawing on his background as a poet and portrait photographer, Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami frames lush environments in terms of his subjects--not the other way around: A room to frame the face, an alleyway askew to blend pedestrians with football dribbling kids. Kiarostami's engrossing cinematography coupled with his commitment to realism does away with the standard need for Apache helicopters and oodles of illicit sex. This makes the many trivialities of our own public lives seem much more exciting; encountering a minor traffic impediment in a well maintained yet not particularly expensive automobile, watching a woman apply a brighter shade of lipstick and slightly gaudy clip-on costume earrings, or maybe just imagining a boy and girl in love. It's not like he's the only one doing it--contemporary realism's been catching on with films like David Fincher's The Social Network (2010) and even with the more explicit Swedish filmed Millennium Trilogy: The Tatoo'd Girl Who Kicked the Flaming Hornet's Nest (2009).

So cynical or not--maybe you're feverishly scanning through your second-cousin's Target registry before the deco-inlay floral design save-the-date card even finds your mailbox? Maybe you're losing count of vodka-tonics while your freshman roommate slaps on the old gold and signs away a lifetime of endearment? Either way, whether you pay your way at the box office or stream a bootlegged screen-rip hosted from a noodle vender's hard drive in Hong Kong, this is a film which challenges itself and cannot be reduced to the sum of its vistas, tacit storyline, and obvious good-looks. It's an easy dose to bend our plastic-cast and franchised notions of originality and weighs in for a hearty night of entertainment.",1312329600,,4533,5.335664335664336
4248696,4,B0042AEU6Y,"Perhaps you remember the 1995 hit ""Before Sunrise,"" with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, where a couple of young strangers spend an evening together in Vienna, mostly talking about life and relationships?

""Certified Copy"" is a similar dialogue-driven film that takes place in a small village in Tuscany during the course of one day.  It's the story of a middle-aged art dealer (Binoche) who invites a British author on tour (Shimel) for a day in the countryside. As the two visit the various museums, churches, and trattorias, and as their conversation progresses, we find there's more to the relationship than meets the eye, and from there the plot takes some completely unexpected turns.

Despite what the trailer makes you believe, this is not a romantic movie about seduction; it's an intelligent and philosophical film about how our expectations affect our perspective, about originality and point of view. It's also a daring puzzle of a movie, and it engages you in the game without you even knowing it.

Binoche is radiant in this film, showing emotions with every raised eyebrow, telling entire stories without saying a word. She actually puts a spell on you! And shifting effortlessly between English, French, and Italian, her charismatic persona drives this minimalistic film from one scene to the next.

Like a good piece of art, ""Certified Copy"" gives you plenty of room to make your own interpretations, and like a good brain game, it will make you think, a lot.",1306972800,38,1473,4.995918367346939
4248697,5,B0042AEU6Y,"You thought you would be settling down to watch just another love story: distinguished, older English-speaking man meets younger, sexy European woman while on a trip to Italy, and romance follows predictably. Ostensibly, this is the way the movie begins; and you settle in, waiting for the first kiss, and waiting for the love story to unfold. But it does not unfold at all. Things just get strange and more complicated as the movie progresses. James Miller, a deeply cynical and emotionally cold writer, on a visit to Italy to promote his book, meets a charming French woman who wants to show him rural Tuscany, and to revisit the town where they were hastily married fifteen years ago.

There are differing opinions as to what exactly transpires in this film. Certainly it's open to more than one interpretation. One is that James and the woman (Binoche), although initially not married or even acquainted, ""take on"" the roles of estranged husband and wife. This interpretation seems very unconvincing to me, since there is no motive as to why they should do this, nor why James should treat this charming and attractive woman in such a shabby way, if they were just playing roles. If they are only playing at being husband and wife, then what is the point of the movie?

After viewing the film several times, it seemed clear to me that they had once been lovers, she had gotten pregnant, they had hastily married, then later separated from one another. The film (mostly) hangs together with this interpretation, but not entirely. There is one spot where James asks the woman ""Where (or when) did you get married?"", as if he has no idea that he is her husband. Also, James has no memory at all of their wedding night, or where they were married. Nor has he much interest in her young son. And he treats this woman like she is nothing to him. How or why does any man turn down the advances of a woman like this? This, it seems to me, is a movie about James and his deep emotional paralysis, more than about the woman or their marriage.

What we thought would be a gentle love story turns out to be a long, sad look at a disintegrating marriage. What we thought was the beginning of a love affair is really its bitter end. We never learn why there is this deep anger and cynicism in James, what devils haunt him, or what his wife has done to deserve his hateful treatment of her. All we know is that James wants nothing more than to get the hell out of Italy by 9 PM. At the end of the movie one may think or hope that James has finally come around, after his venomous outburst at the restaurant. Has he finally decided to forgive his wife, and give her his love again? It is left to the viewer to decide. Despite all its strangeness, I found the movie and the character of James deeply engaging. This is  a long look at a love torn asunder by unknown betrayal; the aching story of a man unwilling to forgive and love.",1306108800,43,2918,4.4588014981273405

4248709,5,B0042AEU6Y,"The wide range of reviews on this page tells you something right away -- reaction to this film is intense, whether positive or negative. It's one of those films that either strikes a deeply resonant chord, or doesn't connect at all. For those in the latter category, of course it'll be pretentious & boring & pointless (to use just a few common complaints). But if it does strike that resonant chord with you, as it did with me, you're in for a rich, rewarding, bittersweet experience of life & love & loss.

The plot barely exists: a woman is in the audience to hear a noted author speak about his latest book, one concerning art & copies of art & questions of authenticity. They meet afterward ... and time becomes ambiguously fluid. Are they just meeting for the first time? Are they playing at it? Are they using each other as surrogates for the actual significant others in their lives? Or is it all of that & more, in an unfolding examination of psyche & relationships? -- And ""relationships"" sounds so clinical & detached in this context, when the film is actually exploring the vast range & limitations of passion, of despair, of idealized love & the ashes of regret -- conflicted humanity, not some case study.

At this point, it's clear that  not everyone will respond well to this film. It offers very little safety or reassurance, so those viewers expecting the usual formula of most contemporary films about couples will feel lost & angry about it. And even those who break down human connections to a list of self-help pop psychology will be equally lost. ""Certified Copy"" goes far beyond comfortable social frameworks of any kind. Its territory is anguish & desire & longing for what no longer exists, and perhaps never did ... or does the interior ideal compensate for the lack of outer reality? Or can they possibly be the same thing?

In short, it's a film that not only asks the viewer questions, but encourages the viewer to pose just as many questions in return. For some, this will be sheer torture. For others, it'll be a rare opportunity. For me, it's a film I'll return to many times in the future, as it's a work of art that acquires a patina of subtle, complex feeling over time -- most highly recommended!",1447113600,,2233,4.61712846347607

4248711,4,B0042AEU6Y,"An un-named woman (so let's call her Elle) played by Juliette Binoche, who owns an antique shop went to a book-launching event to meet the author, James Miller (William Shimell) and to have six copies signed by the author.  She was distracted by her young son who's more interested in a hamburger and coke.  So she left  prematurely but not before asking the gentleman sitting beside her who happened to be the organizer of the event to give the author her phone number.

Miller dropped by her shop and so begins a man meets woman story and we expect a romantic movie.  But wait!  As the story moves along, there's more to it!  The story is purported to have happened in the course of one day, and in that time  we are led by Director Kiarostami to a roller-coaster of a ride with unexpected turn of events up to the very end.  Kiarostami left it to the viewer to determine how the story ends.  He did this to his other movie, A Taste of Cherry.

Why is the movie titled Certified Copy?  Is it  a remake of Rosellini's Journey to Italy?  Or are the main characters playing the roles of every husband and wife in the world, acting and reacting like any couple in a given situation?

Binoche is brilliant in this movie, deservedly winning the Best Actress award at Cannes. William Shimell likewise is the perfect foil to Binoche's  mercurial character with his cold intellectual Englishness, feelings well under control until that scene in the restaurant.

This movie must be watched more than once to be able to form one's own interpretation and choice of ending.  Were they husband and wife who came back to the town of Alezzo to celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary?  Maybe the scene on the coffee shop could help.

Binoche won the Best Actress award at Cannes for her performance and I can understand why. She is a shattered woman and it's hard not to get involved in her angst, which is extremely believable and complex. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone - so I can't say too much about the plot. Binoche meets a writer at a lecture and they spend the day together in Tuscany. She has a teenage son who is quite challenging (aren't they all). But the movie really becomes a character study of two people - Binoche and the writer. Who are they? What are they to each other?

It means very little) would not be able to pay enough (very-well-paid and rewarding in spiritual terms) attention to understand and appreciate the many, MANY magnificent artful subtleties of Kiarostami in this film or let's say the myriad rare and subtle achievements of Rohmer's films which ""Certified Copy"" most resembles in a bit darker fashion. I've also noticed that these kinds of artless or attention-deficit people unable to concentrate on details in a frame and wanting to be force-fed and played like a piano don't like the fertile zeitgeist of the 1960's very much and especially the early and most revolutionary films of Godard which they consider ""amateurish."" They think it was childish and they, NOW, in this ridiculously hypocritical and fake world they've built with all this silly gadgetry used in the most superficial ways, are somehow better and more advanced! lol That's the biggest laugh of all. To think that a director who is a real artist (de-sign scientist, one who creates new signs or de-signifies through sensuous imagery) and not just dancing as a hack for money and fame and who makes a serious film SHOULD decide for us what ""exactly"" it's trying to say, as if real life ever does, rather than make the best presented case, with all warts intact, to let US, the other human beings viewing these representations (and hopefully able to process it), decide our own interpretation of it, as in real life we always do, for better or worse, and only in false artifice (the intuited and then fallaciously not-true-to-objective-reality approximated fake that does not make you see the real, the lie, copy or approximation that does not make you see the closest approximation: the truth or get you closer to this most valid conception but away from it towards more lies) for the worse, by the way. ""Certified Copy"" is certainly not false or pretentious art and Kiarostami's rare and formerly thought-to-be-lost 2nd film ""The Report,"" made in 1976 during the last years of the Shah's Iran, also included on the Criterion Bluray, is even less so. That film, made close to 40 years ago, is even more masterful, one of his best. This guy is one of the very few master film-makers still left today. Most of of the overpraised others are pretenders to the throne.

 ""It might be a basic characteristic of existence that those who would know it completely would perish, in which case the strength of spirit should be measured according to how much of the 'truth' one could still barely endure--or to put it more clearly, to what degree one would require it to be thinned down, shrouded, sweetened, blunted, falsified.""  ~ FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE, Beyond Good and Evil

""The drive toward the formation of metaphors is the fundamental human drive, which one cannot for a single instant dispense with in thought, for one would thereby dispense with man himself. This drive is not truly vanquished and scarcely subdued by the fact that a regular and rigid new world is constructed as its prison from its own ephemeral products, the concepts. It seeks a new realm and another channel for its activity, and it finds this in myth and in art generally. This drive continually confuses the conceptual categories and cells by bringing forward new transferences, metaphors, and metonymies. It continually manifests an ardent desire to refashion the world which presents itself to waking man, so that it will be as colorful, irregular, lacking in results and coherence, charming, and eternally new as the world of dreams. Indeed, it is only by means of the rigid and regular web of concepts that the waking man clearly sees that he is awake; and it is precisely because of this that he sometimes thinks that he must be dreaming when this web of concepts is torn by art."" ~ Friedrich Nietzsche, ""On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense"" (1873)

Every idea that is a true idea has a form, and is capable of many forms. The variety of forms of which it is capable determines the value of the idea. So by way of ideas, and your mastery of them in relation to what you are doing, will come your value as an architect to your society and future."" - ""Idea and Essence"" September 7, 1958  Frank Lloyd Wright",1429142400,3,4496,4.840052015604681

4248721,5,B0042AEU6Y,"Immediately unique and interesting about this film is that the dialogue is in English, Italian and French. The characters move between the languages as real multi-lingual speakers often do. Another unique feature is that this film was created by Iranian writer and director Abbas Kiarostami and he selected William Shimell, a British opera singer to play the lead role, his first ever. The film takes place in Tuscany and the leading lady is the lovely Juliette Binoche whose mother is Czechoslovakian and this eclectic combination of nationalities, languages and cultures makes for a very human story.

It begins where James Miller (the writer) is speaking on his new book, ""Certified Copy"" which is about arguments in the art world about originals vs. reproductions. His argument is that issues of authenticity are completely irrelevant, because each and every reproduction is itself an original and even the original is a copy of another form. A woman comes in late, is distracted by her son, exchanges whispers with the gentleman who organized the event and leaves early because her son is unable to sit still and is hungry. The son seems to play with the mother through a series of questions and comments and the mother gets frustrated.

Juliette Binoche maintains this role between emotions throughout the film and you see her at once be cynical yet vulnerable, strong yet weak, angry yet forgiving. The author appears in her art shop and they are to spend the day together until he must catch his train promptly at 9 p.m. As the dialogue unfolds, you begin to understand that there is much more to their relationship than a woman driving around a visiting foreign author. By the end of the film you are asking yourself, are they a married couple or simply pretending to be? Why would they pretend? She seems so hurt, cynical and resentful at times and uses the people around her in such a manipulative way. Yet in a moment, she becomes childish, vulnerable and seductive. He seems so cool and aloof and his distance suddenly changes into agitated anger.

Their discussions get extremely personal, and it's unclear which, if either, is the true reality of the film - which is what makes this film so terrific (and surely a part of the Criterion Collection). The director moves the viewer between levity and drama and captures us through all of the emotions in the work. Many of the camera shots and angles are such that you feel you are in the film with the characters and emotionally invested when you see the very subtle nuances and depth which Binoche displayed brilliantly.",1421884800,,2583,4.865909090909091

That's it. But the guy is unable to do it. Rather, he is unable to do it with anything other than awkwardness and reluctance. That is why he becomes so angry in the restaurant -- he did something he didn't want to do.

4248759,4,B0042AEU6Y,"""Certified Copy"" is true to life, from first frame to last. It plays like two very real people trying to re-explore their abandoned relationship, while leisurely walking through a charming Italian villa that serves as a backdrop. I'm not sure how the film was shot, but it does seem as if non-speaking roles among the supporting cast were taken by extras who just happened to be strolling about town. Some bystanders even appear to be gawking at the camera. This gives ""Certified Copy"" the look of authenticity, for the viewer becomes a witness to the filmmaker's travelogue while also deeply caring for what happens between Elle and James (Juliette Binoche and William Shimell). I won't give away the end, but my sympathies went to Elle, a sweet single mom who is willing to invest her soul in a man she loves, while the object of her affection, James Miller, finds no one quite as interesting as himself, fascinated by his own wit and intelligence. At one critical point, he puts his arm on Elle's shoulder, and we hope that he is finally learning to open up his heart and share his emotions rather than secluding them within. But ""Certified Copy"" is never that easy. It is unpredictable and will keep you guessing. I liked this film quite a lot for its sensitive depiction of the vulnerability of love, but don't expect to see quick cuts, fancy camera work, or special effects.

The only thing I have to add that I have not seen here is that, to me, the character James Miller fits the profile for Asperger's Syndrome, or High Functioning Autism. His lack of empathy and inability to read her body language, his disdain/dislike for social mores (i.e., sentimentality toward marriage and the presentation of the wine at restaurants) are common traits.  Asperger adults think differently than neurotypical people as their brains are wired differently so they have different perspectives on life.  They cannot filter out external stimuli, so they avoid crowds and noisy places.  Intimacy, while being pleasurable to neurotypicals, may cause these people great anxiety, an overwhelming sense of being smothered.  His withdrawal from her could be for his emotional survival. I have read that the film was autobiographical.  Whether or not, it is a portrait of a man who matches the profile for AS very well.

Abbas Kiarostami is a deeply talented director who has given us the gift of his creations in film.  I look forward to seeing his other work in future.",1386892800,2,1186,5.077319587628866

Basically, it involves a meeting between an English author doing a book tour in Italy, going on an outing with an overworked French mother who is living in Italy, while awaiting his train.  The dialogue, very philosophical at times about life, marriage, et al, revolves around these two people. Incidental comments made to them by others as they tour the streets of a small Italian town, leads these two people's discussion in interesting directions.

4248774,5,B0042AEU6Y,"The multi-talented filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami is known for his films, documentaries, poetry, paintings and graphic designs.  Considered as one of the most influential filmmakers to come from the Middle East and known for his films such as the ""Koker Trilogy"", ""Taste of Cherry"", ""The Wind Will Carry Us"" and ""Close Up"", in 2010, Kiarostami would reunite with his ""Shirin"" actress, Juliette Binoche for the film ""Certified Copy"" (Copie Conforme).

Written and directed by Abbas Kiarostami and shot in Tuscany, ""Certified Copy"" would feature Juliette Binoche (""Thee Colors: Blue"", ""The English Patient"", ""Cache"") and opera singer William Shimell (""Hercules"", ""Love"").  The film would be Kiarostami's first film shot and produced outside of Iran, it would also be the first film of Kiarostami in creating European cinema.  And sure enough, the film would receive rave reviews from critics and audiences worldwide and the film would also earn Juliette Binoche the ""Best Actress Award"" at the Cannes Film Festival.

And now ""Certified Copy"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of the Criterion Collection.  Also, included with this release is Abbas Kiarostami's first feature film, ""The Report"" (1977).

VIDEO:

""Certified Copy"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio) and there is no doubt that Kiarostami's use of the Red digital camera brought a lot of detail to his latest film.  The colors are vibrant, detail and clarity look magnificent and  I detected no video-related problems, no artifacts, banding, edge enhancement...nothing.  ""Certified Copy"" looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray!

According to the Criterion Collection, the film was shot in 4K RAW using a RED digital camera and the entire production was completed in a fully digital workflow.  The color grading and digital interpositive were approved by director Abbas Kiarostami and director of photography Luca Bigazzi.  The final color corrected DPX files were output to Rec. 709 high-definition color space for BD and DVD release.

As for ""The Report"", the Criterion Collection presents the 1977 film in the best quality available to them.  While the film looks good for its age.  While there is some film damage with occasional green lines that can be seen and some other damage.  But most visible towards the beginning of the film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Certified Copy"" is presented in English, French and Italian DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (note: one audio track, with all three languages used in the film).  Dialogue is crystal clear and the film features good use of atmospheric ambiance.  From the sounds of Tuscany, the birds and vehicles and more.  The lossless track is primarily dialogue-driven through the front and center channels but the audio quality is great and I detected no audio problems.  Optional Subtitles are included.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original 5.1 lossless soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from the original digital audio master using Pro Tools HD.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Certified Copy - The Criterion Collection #612 on Blu-ray comes with the following special features:

JUDGMENT CALL:

 When it comes to films that are verbose, cerebral and dialogue-driven, more often, they can be too much for a viewer.  But when executed perfectly, you know you have something special.

May it be a film like Eric Rohmer's ""My Night at Maud's"" where characters spend a long time in discussion, but these they talk about aren't banal, these are intelligent discussions by two individuals about life, art, reproduction.  But then you get this little twist that is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Antonioni's ""L'Avventura"" or Alain Resnais ""Last Year At Marienbad"" where the characters may appear to have known each other or perhaps have been in a relationship before, because their intelligent discussion leads to an argument that couples experience.

And that is one thing that is rather fascinating about ""Certified Copy"", unlike Resnais ""Last Year at Marienbad"" which surrealism and visual filmmaking come together in a rather complex fashion, Kiarostami's ""Certified Copy"" gives us no clues that the two are a couple, a former couple or two people trying to act out an experiment of relationships.  Or perhaps it is a dream... or is it reality?

Nothing is explained but it allows the viewer to give their own interpretation.  And this is important because the film's original topic was about the concept of art and reproduction.  When we look at art, we have a response toward it. But that response can be different.  The same with this relationship, we have our own interpretation if these two characters.  In my mind, almost like painting that I spend a lot of time watching in a museum... you have these ideas of what is the intention of the artwork, what is the history and was the painting influenced by another.

With the characters of James Miller and the antique dealer, my mind was already dead set that these two individuals knew each other long ago, were in love and this visit was a way for them to escape reality and re-enact a moment of what if they were a couple.

Now I go back to the common argument of the film, art vs. reproduction and how the character of James Miller felt that reproductions were originals, as the original was also inspired or a copy of something else.  And when you start to think of the film and analyze it, what if that was the initial thought.  Using art as a symbol, but featuring cinema.  Cinema like art can be original but yet others  may feel it's a copy or inspired by another film.

And then you wonder if its life imitating art.  Abbas Kiarostami once told actress Juliette Binoche that the film was based on his life, then changed his story that it was based on his life and then tells media that it s a story that incorporates Juliette's life.  In other words, the message is that art, cinema and everything created can be original but yet can be inspired by something else.  So, what others will think of ""Certified Copy"" as original, others may point to Resnais ""Last Year at Marienbad"", Antonioni's ""L'Avventura"" or Wong Kar-Wai's ""In the Mood for Love"", and think that the film was inspired by those or other similar, dream-like type of films.

But do we need an explanation of why Kiarostami created the film?  I don't think so, and that's what makes ""Certified Copy"" so enjoyable to watch.  It's a film that YOU interpret on your own.  And if everyone comes up with a different answer, then so be it, I'm sure filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami would be pleased.

Another reason why I enjoyed ""Certified Copy"" is how Kiarostami handles relationships.  He goes into more detail about this in the special feature but it's the concept of the conflicts that are experienced between a man and woman in a relationship.  The more we understand each other, the worse things get.  And it's a concept that many married couples or those who have been in long time relationships can understand.  When things go bad, we look to others who make things look as they are going so great but are they?  We have two characters who are somewhat soul searching and through each other, may it be through this playful interaction or may they be true emotions that are coming out, it's that sense of the unpredictable that captivates us.  There is more going on with these two that is explained but yet, these conflicts can be understood, because many of us have experienced these uncertainties as well.

As for the performance, Juliette Binoche was absolutely fantastic in this film and for a first time major role for opera singer William Shimell, to have him memorize his line, including the long dialogue (which surprised Binoche who didn't memorize everything, and utilized improvisation to coincide with Shimell's performance) and literally be prepared for his role, I was impressed by his performance.  But both talents did a wonderful job.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Certified Copy"" looks amazing on Blu-ray and cineaste who are fans of Kiarostami's work should be pleased as there are no video or audio-related problems that I could find with this release.  And as far as special features go, it's one thing that you get a documentary on the making-of the film and an interview with Kiarostami but the fact that the Criterion Collection also included his first feature film ""The Report"" (1977) with this release is fantastic!

Overall, if you are a cinema fan who loves films that incorporate intelligent conversation but also a film that incorporates Abbas Kiarostami's brilliant direction and fascinating screenplay, which also further compliments the performance by Juliette Binoche and William Shimell, ""Certified Copy"" is highly recommended!",1352332800,2,9464,5.0211674150096215
4248775,5,B0042AEU6Y,"Many other reviewers have discussed plot details and the characters so I'll just cut to the chase:  The film exists as a reflection of your own views of love and relationships.  From moment to moment, you fill in the blanks of knowledge that the director purposely provides you.  You write a narrative in your head, and even as he continues to throw out conflicting information that conflicts with the story you've been building, you can't help but keep building.  For this reason, what you think about the film (if you actually enjoyed it for what it is) says far more about you than it does about the story or the characters.

For example, there were moments in the film where I wanted to text an ex and tell her ""you must watch this, it appears to be about people that dealt with a similar story to ours and are spending a day together 15 years after the break up.""  Then, 10 minutes after that, I had to toss that idea out the window because the parameters of the story seamlessly changed to something completely different.  Another example is that we don't know if the child is the product of infidelity or the actual son of the male lead.  It is a very disorienting film and requires you to go into the experience prepared for that.  The one star reviews out there are the product of people seeing that the film is critically acclaimed and then just going into it blind.  Know that it is a deconstruction of love and marriage and simultaneously a meditation on the subjectivity and true value of art.",1350691200,4,1506,4.5036764705882355

4248778,4,B0042AEU6Y,"In ""Certified Copy,"" a man and a woman who've just met go through all the rituals of courtship and marriage in a single afternoon.  Or are they an actual married couple simply pretending to be strangers as a means of seeing their relationship from a fresh perspective and perhaps giving themselves a chance to start over as a couple?

As presented to us at the start, Elle (played by the always wonderful Juliette Binoche) is an attractive middle-aged single mother who is finding it increasingly difficult to both raise her rather trying adolescent son and retain any identify of her own.  James Miller (played by British opera singer William Shimell) is a well-known cultural critic who has just written a best-seller, ""Certified Copy,"" on the subject of originals and copies in art.  After attending one of his lectures, Binoche meets up with Miller one Sunday, and together they spend a desultory afternoon touring the Italian countryside , first getting to know one another, then assuming the roles of husband and wife, whereupon they quarrel and bicker, flirt with and wound one another, and come to terms with how love and marriage change over the years.  So is this an original - i.e., actual - married couple or a copy of one?  I don't think we're supposed to know, and, frankly, I suspect that`s the way Iranian writer/director Abbas Kiarostami intended it to be.

The multi-national ""Certified Copy"" is a leisurely paced, loquacious, but often insightful look into the nature of man/woman relationships.  Binoche and Shimell do a beautiful job embodying the two characters, while Kiarostami's direction is spare and unobtrusive, often lingering for long stretches of time on his actors' faces while they articulate at great length their characters' innermost feelings and concerns.

Clearly, ""Certified Copy"" is not for all viewers, some of whom may conclude that the two of them are simply bananas and, thus, opt to move on.  But for those willing to suspend their disbelief and accept something a little different, the film is filled with many rewards. And the glorious Italian backgrounds alone should be enough to make anyone stick around.",1342051200,2,2154,5.042253521126761

4248780,3,B0042AEU6Y,"Juliette Binoche is an unnamed woman who manages to get a front row seat at a book signing in Tuscany.  The author is a British writer named James Miller (opera star William Shimell) who admits he has no training in art.  His book argues the point that a ""copy"" of a painting or piece of art that is a well made counterfeit is no less valuable than the ""original.""  The woman slips an address to the writer's translator after being hounded by her teenage son that he's hungry.  It is the address of her art shop.  Miller shows up and they begin a conversation that will last for the next 90 minutes.

The woman drives him to a remote village and along the way they have some mild disagreements.  Do they really know each other?  Once in the village, a caf owner assumes they are married after overhearing an argument.  Are they?  Were they?  The couple now behaves like a once married or now married couple.  The woman suggests they visit a room where they had their honeymoon.  Miller doesn't seem to be interested or even familiar with the town.  So what's going on? Beats me.

To complicate matter further, the woman and Miller speak fluent English, French and Italian and shift in and out of those languages often.  Sometimes they speak the same language, sometimes one is speaking one, while the other is speaking something else, all at the same time.  I'm sure Iranian director and writer Abbas Kiarostami is trying to confuse the audience and he succeeds.  For me this was pretty boring after a while.  Certainly Binoche and Shimell are a handsome couple and look like they belong together.  Their performances are very good but I'm not sure they knew what Kiarostami had in mind either.

I watched this film on a Criterion Blu ray 1080p transfer. It has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and in a word, is perfect.  The audio as well has DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is likewise pristine.

I sat through about twenty minutes and quit and came here to see what others had written about it.  From the few reviews I scanned it seemed that there was a surprise coming which would make the film interesting.  So I went back and sat through another fifteen minutes.  The acting was so bad...it seemed that Binoche was improvising and doing it very badly.  The man was just wooden.  I couldn't figure out why the Binoche character was so incredibly annoyed at her son.  She seemed terminally angry about everything and I failed to care what happened to her.  Their conversations, about the value of an original over a copy were ridiculous....was this supposed to be deep stuff?  Yikes....I don't know the work of this film maker...maybe he should have stayed back in his own culture.  This seems like wannabe French nouvelle vague that was very fashionable a half century ago...when it was stylish and well done.

Film is indeed the equal to those other artforms, but only on its own terms, never by trying to be something that its not. Which brings us to the film in question, Certified Copy. It takes some very timeworn post-modern theories about art and reality and applies them to a rather pedestrian story about a relationship between a man and a woman. What results might one expect from this? Something that's all over the place and never completely decides what it's saying? I would say so. Godard got away with this sort of thing in the 60's because it was the 60's and he was Godard. What's Kiarostami's alibi for here in 2000's? I would say it was a semi-noble attempt to make an art film like this in this day and age...but on the other hand, it just feels like wishful thinking, that somehow there's something new to be said. Anyway, the film gets upped from one star to two because Juliette Binoche was good and the film was at least watchable (barely).

Filmed in Lucignano, Italy it follows what starts out as a book signing encounter between a woman (with teen son) and an author. Yet, something odd immediately strikes you as you sense there is more to this encounter than just a random book signing especially when the son mentions, with his wry smile, the lack of a surname in some of the signings. The age of the son and future conversations involving events from 5 and 15 years ago and discourse about the nature of being authentic and taking responsibility and relationships are suggestive of one interpretation. But, also are the abstract discussions on original art vs. copies as applied to people's relationships. She not only leads while walking but controls the discussion throughout the movie. The female as the foundation of family and relationships? The author's exit with a downward solemn gaze at the end perhaps does not bode well for male commitment in relationships.

The conceit of the film may be unique, and who doesn't love Juliette Binoche?, but what a slog this film was-and I like slow movies.

The professor keeps his distance from real life (everything is evidence of one thesis or another to him even though there is plenty of evidence that he doesn't really believe his own thesis) but the gallery owner with her earthy charms and common sense appeals nonetheless tries to seduce him away from his intellectual formulations. Kiarostami, in true art film fashion, weaves plenty of ambiguity into his tale. Although the self-satisified professor is something of a cliche/copy of other self-satisfied professors, he is intrigued by the gallery owners more natural way of connecting to art which to her is an extension of life. And while the gallery owner is something of a cliche/single mother with 11 yr old child, she is intrigued by the professors devotion to his work. Each seems to draw the other out of his or her usual channels/frequencies, at least in those rare moments when they are not arguing. One could say that the professor and the gallery owner are both grown tired of their roles and their meeting or meetings (it is unclear throughout how long and in what capacity these two know each other) afford them the opportunity to see themselves (the cliched roles they play and views they hold) more clearly. One of Kiarostami's earlier films, Close-Up (1990), is about a man who poses as a famous fim director and while playing this assumed role he has the power to affect other's lives (until his ""true"" identity is revealed). In Certified Copy, the director again allows us to consider the power of illusion and play.

4248793,5,B0042AEU6Y,"Certified Copy is Iranian film-maker Abbas Kiarostami's first European film, and he has certainly succeeded in continuing a legacy of fascinating, intellectual cinema despite delving into foreign territory. In researching Kiarostami, I stumbled across the observation that his films tend to be insular and self-referential. Given my previous experiences with his work, namely the minimalist yet profoundly philosophical and formally unique Taste of Cherry (1997), I'm not surprised to find that Certified Copy lives up to this alleged attribute of the director. I can't say that I've seen a film quite like this, which appears at first to be influenced by the likes of Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. But it expands and contracts and shifts as it moves along, ending on such a unique and somewhat perplexing (yet remarkably euphoric) note that all attempts at fitting Certified Copy into the history of cinema quickly become futile, that is unless you consider Kiarostami's oeuvre. It is then immediately surmisable that this lovely, confounding essay could only emerge from this decidedly singular artist.

The film opens in Italy, where British writer James Miller (William Shimell) is giving a lecture on his latest book, an exploration of the concepts of originality and authenticity in works of art. An unnamed admirer, played by Juliette Binoche, sits restless in the front row, distracted by the nagging of her son who is more interested in satiating his hunger than listening to Miller's theories. She is forced to leave early, passing along her number so that she might meet Miller at her antique shop where he will sign copies of his book. Once the two unite, we are swept into the sometimes uncomfortable cadence that characterizes the intersection of strangers. Eventually, it is suggested that they are actually estranged lovers of some kind, perhaps playing the role of a pair of people who have never known each other.

What we ultimately discover is not a romance but a sudden, perhaps jarring transformation within the confines of an incredibly specific discussion of whether or not there is such a thing as replication. Everything in life is a matter of perspective, and this idea plays directly into how the film is constructed and how it unfolds. The film making itself reveals early on that we are not to settle into anything or become familiar with anyone. As the antique dealer and the academic drive through town soon after connecting, we notice and are taken by the picturesque windshield reflections of a Tuscan town superimposed on unfamiliar faces, only to feel suddenly cheated somehow. Kiarostami places a slowly changing, physically beautiful wall between us and the protagonists, obfuscating our standard opportunity to visually engage with the main characters.

This is but one example of the ways in which the cinematic medium is uniquely employed to keep the audience on its toes, conjuring a curiosity as to which perspective is most important or most accurate. The curiosity does not cease, and that is Kiarostami's master stroke. Juliette Binoche in particular manages to occupy a multiplicity of emotional states that serve to underline Kiarostami's intentions with Certified Copy. Binoche performs this role like an actress at the peak of her talents, fully inhabiting each moment so that our suspicion that this narrative is absolutely real does not dissipate.

Kiarostami continues to suggest and hint until he finally pushes us into the perspective that we suspect must be true, an end result that hardly provides answers. Miller's ideas always populate their discussion, generating debates and drawing out emotions, but the expansion into the personal begins to add gravity. Through all of the playfulness and reconsideration, Kiarostami, his cast, and his crew achieve a deep sense of truth, a kind of emotional realism that only rings more clearly because it defies you to settle on a conclusion. Rarely do I come across a film that feels as much like a challenge as it does like a fresh idea, a quiet revelation that I very suddenly hoped would disappear behind the screen of intellectualism.",1327276800,7,4161,5.1875

4248796,5,B0042AEU6Y,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet despite the fact that I have a lot to say about this film; namely because the beauty this film possesses is almost entirely corroded by the spoiling of its unfolding plot.  To say that this film is pure magic would be an understatement, for it is probably one of the most honest and poignant looks at relationships I've ever had the pleasure of watching.  Taking a seeming chance meeting between an author and an art gallery owner and using it as a medium to enrich the audience with a breathtaking point of view regarding love, life and marriage; `Certified Copy' is simply flawless.

That gallery owner is Elle, played with natural charm and ease by the stunning Juliette Binoche (in possibly the finest performance of 2011).  That author is James.  James and Elle meet at a conference and come together for a day of sightseeing in beautiful Tuscany.  They share a love of art, yet mixed feelings regarding the purity of said art.  As the day unfolds, the contrast between authenticated art pieces and mere copies bleeds into life in general, as truths about Elle and James become manifest in slight yet overwhelming details.  The concept of art imitating life is taking rather literally here, but not in the sense that one might initially expect.  Instead, the film is filled with subtle comparisons that help highlight the true intentions of writer/director Abbas Kiarostami.  With a deft hand (oh my, those soft directorial flourishes are magnificent), Kiarostami coaxes a beautifully delicate relationship between two very dynamic souls.

I don't want to give anything away!

I'll end by noting Juliette Binoche, because her performance is one of the best I've seen in years.  The way that she completely bares her soul with such soft undertones is flawless.  I love the way she is always reacting to what is going on around her.  Her eyes are constantly reflecting her inner mood, even when her face remains stagnant.  The `coffee shop scene' alone is a work of genius and she OWNS that scene with such heartbreaking realism.  I love her naturalness.  Binoche reminds me of my love for Kristen Scott-Thomas, another actress who just breathes such infectious charm into her performances.  The way that Binoche can play with her character is compelling.  I love how she shifts her moods with ease, never feeling out of place but always feeling genuine in tone.  The final scene is a flawless depiction of her character's need to feel something nostalgic in order to justify her affections.  She just wants to hold on with dear life.

I'll say no more; just watch this movie.  It is so deeply effective and it sneaks up on you in more ways than one.  It is a very fresh and original spin on the `relationship movie', and it certainly will remain one of the best films of 2011.",1326153600,5,2819,4.774793388429752

A female character called ""Her"" in the credits (Juliette Binoche) finagles a meeting with James Miller (William Shimell), a British author who has written a book arguing that one's subjective response to art is what gives it value. It doesn't matter if the art is a forgery or an original or a Coca-Cola sign: if you respond to it, it's art. (I am doing a fair amount of damage to his theory for the sake of brevity.)

Binoche and the author go for a drive in Tuscany, having a sort of ""first date"" conversation. When they arrive at a cafe, Miller excuses himself to take a phone call outside. The waitress addresses Binoche, saying she can tell Miller is a ""good husband."" Instead of correcting her, Binoche plays along, inventing an elaborate history for her and her ""husband."" When Miller returns, Binoche fills him in on the details of their sham marriage. There seems to be a period when they both play at being married.

Then, the marriage becomes very real, indeed. Binoche becomes emotional at Miller's extended absences from her and their son. He defends himself, not very successfully. The remainder of the film is a domestic drama between two characters with an actual shared history.

It may be the most daring narrative pivot since Bill Pullman woke up as Balthazar Getty in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Highway/dp/B001152TL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Highway</a>.

Back to the original point: is CERTIFIED COPY a masterpiece or a hoax? Well. It's a movie about art, and whether a forgery can have as much subjective value as an original. The film, then, is both original and forged. Which part is which? Does it matter?

(Well-played cameo by Jean-Claude Carrire, best known as the co-screenwriter of Bunuel's four final films. He's the chap at the fountain who gives marital advice to Miller.)",1325462400,3,2152,4.9972067039106145
4248801,5,B0042AEU6Y,"So the theme is change through time and there are at least three stories in the plot, if not more. The director lashes out the magic of languages to change the lanscape of a love story. But because the actors haven't changed their look and age, I was first baffled, dazzled, too, by the illusion of time standing still for 15 years. After the movie, I realized, time changes here as well. In a nutshell, English tells the first story, how a man and woman get together. Then, Italian tells the second story where and when a married couple drifts apart, with a newly-wed couple in contrast and an older couple in comparison. Lastly, the third story, in French, tells the inevitable disillusion of all relationships. Men are inconstant and women fragile, or vice versa. That's how good this movie is. That's how rare and baffled this movie could be. Its scope is large and its audience preselected. Certified Copy is not for wiser viewers, nor for the inexperienced. I feel it is a movie for me, for middle-aged men and women who suffer their lives with attachment and detachment of love at the moment.",1325289600,19,1099,4.641025641025641

4248805,5,B0042AEU6Y,Marriage is a complicated thing and this movie does a good job of looking at a marriage that has fallen apart.  Bad relationships make sad movies but such movies give thought to why relationships come apart.  The movie is beautifully filmed in Tusacany.  The acting was very well done.  The script was well written.  I think that you will enjoy this film and I hope that Amazon finds other wonderful movies that are as wonderful as this for their customers.,1324684800,2,457,4.6625
4248806,5,B0042AEU6Y,"An author on tour to promote his book has an apparently chance meeting with a French woman (Juliette Binoche), and their encounter proves to be something far more than casual.  The latest film by celebrated Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami is also his first to be filmed outside of his native country.  Starring Juliette Binoche (who took home the best actress award at Cannes for her stunningly enigmatic performance in this film), Certified Copy starts from a premise that promises an exotic love story, and gradually turns into a subtle and profound meditation on art, memory, truth, and identity.

To give a quick sense of the feel of this remarkable film I might suggest it combines the conversational intimacy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunset/dp/B0002YLC24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunset</a>&nbsp;and the intellectual intrigue of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Year-at-Marienbad/dp/B001WLMOLO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Year at Marienbad</a>.  The problem is that comparison makes this seem like a derivative work, that merely copies elements of established works.  It's not.  Like all of the works I've seen by Abbas Kiarostami, this is a true original.  Or if its a copy, it's a genuine copy.  It's a fascinating film, that I've seen twice now, and that I look forward to watching again, since I got even more from it the second time.  It's a densely layered film, where details refer to other details, and each calls up a range of themes and ideas, but where the intellectual intrigue is balanced by an emotional tension and resonance, and that wears its layers lightly, almost as if it were all improvised.  It's both a delightful romance - that might be said to skip the romance, straight to the after of the happily ever after - and a subtle philosophical exploration of a wide range of fascinating themes.

(Note that this review is for the film itself, which I saw in theaters, and not for this particular Blu-Ray edition, which I don't have.)",1323475200,3,2082,5.619808306709265

My wife kept prodding me to keep watching in hopes that something might actually happen.  It didn't.  They start out as strangers and then we learn near the end of the film that they were married for 15 years and yet their son has no clue who the man is!  Go figure.  They stop for a morning coffee, walk around a corner into a plaza, argue some more about a statue in the middle of the plaza and then boom, it's late afternoon and time for dinner.  Huh?

8413389,5,B0042AEU6Y,"Kiarostami's film is an astoundingly wise inquiry into art, creativity, authenticity, and the nature of the archetypal masculine and feminine. Elle and James seemingly have just met as the film commences, and James is an author, and art critic. It's his philosophy concerning the nature of ""real"" art v.s copies that drives a lot of the conversation between the two. It's a theme that's meant to educate on the nature of the authentic self that's usually covered up by our conditioning by the time we reach adulthood. Elle's son, her sister Marie, and Marie's husband who stutters her name out to express his love are examples of authenticity, as well.
As the film progresses, Elle and James enter into increasing levels of intimacy, surprising the audience over and over. Of course most of us have been on this ride from meeting with attractive stranger to entangled attachment, to the frustration of expecting others to fulfill our wishes, to the suffering and arguments and finally to some measure of detachment. In the ride Kiarostami takes us on, we get to watch the process from the observer standpoint. We get to observe the ways that masculine and feminine magnetize; attract and then repel.
There is a wealth of symbolism here, from the statuary in Elle's antiques shop, to telephone conversations, to weddings and costume jewelry earrings and, indeed, a certified copy. I published a symbolic review of this film in my e book Poetry in Motion: 19 Symbolic Reviews of Transformational Film, here on Amazon (software for linking is not working right now).",1487548800,,1563,4.992337164750958

Looking forward to watch more films of the master.",1480291200,,385,5.416666666666667
