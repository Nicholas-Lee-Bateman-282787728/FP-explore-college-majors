5711043,4,B00CB7SRG4,"I like the movies. but has a lot of love scene in it. I love that on the dices in bonus features there fashion close up. you see all the fashion from wick dice you put in dvd player. but not on the movie (When In Rome). There must be to much fashion in the movie.

I gust because they work for fashion designers.

5711047,4,B00CB7SRG4,My girls really love these movies. I have twins as well so they relate to some of the silliness that twins endure. This was a very good deal however the movies were poorly packages. All four discs set on the same clasp (one circle for all four discs). It would have been ideal to separate them because I am worried they are going to get scratched up easily. I might just have to buy some empty cases and label them.,1376438400,9,415,4.2

I asked for this because I wanted to revisit my childhood. I didn't open the case to watch any of the videos for over a month after receiving them. When I finally did, they were stacked on top of one another rather than in individual slots. Also, the DVD ""Winning London"" was not included in this supposed ""Set Of 4"". I popped each disc in to check if perhaps there were two videos on any one disc, but that was not so. I'm sure I'd be much better pleased if the complete product had been received.",1490572800,2,637,4.145161290322581

5711106,5,B00CB7SRG4,EXCELLENT PRICE! TOTALLY worth it. Even though they come stacked in case on top of each other. I am not sure why they did that. With packaging it. It doesn't bother me because my DVDs are in a DVD case anyway. They won't stay in the box they came in. Each had the name of the movie labeled on it. Doesn't look super cheap. Nice quality. I give 5 stars!

5711112,3,B00CB7SRG4,"My younger sister and I had a tradition of watching the Olsen Twin's movies growing up, so I thought this would be a good Christmas gift idea. My sister was very excited to receive these movies and we had a throw back movie marathon shortly after Christmas.

Upon opening the movie packaging seemed homemade as all 4 discs were stacked in one disc compartment and only one of the discs had the disc applique that said the movie title and depicted the cover, the other 3 were stacked directly on top of the main disc and were all blank discs with no applique. I believe someone took the movie cover out of the plastic and replaced it with a homemade cover depicting all 4 movies. Typically when you purchase multi disc packs the package has a separate compartment for a 4 discs and they are all separately labeled not home burned movies.

The movies all play properly and we had a blast watching them, so I will still give 3 stars on my review. If the movies had been better packaged they would have received 5 stars.",1452643200,,1016,4.427807486631016

Gotta give these girls credit, the youngest self-made millionaires ever, and worked their butts off to get there. They still do. Not too many positive role model movies for girls this age, so these are a great addition to a tween video library, to be re-discovered for future generations to enjoy seeing girls who are smart, witty, and dress in clothes that are cute and not revealing.

Holiday in the Sun was beautiful too
but the picture was all fuzzy and grainy

thought i'd be better off buying the original
but the picture was grainy on that one too

sad they made such a beautiful movie
and the quality didn't make it to the dvd

does anyone have the original film?

five stars for the beautiful movies

8579620,4,B00CB7SRG4,"Ill be honestthe only reason I bought this is because I wanted Passport To Paris. I couldn't find it anywhere online to buy (Amazon Video and iTunes only have the movie available to rent). I bought this DVD collection because Passport To Paris was very expensive to buy on its own (and the DVD was used, and I try to avoid buying used electronics whenever possible). Ive never seen When In Rome or Winning London; I have seen Holiday In The Sun and fortunately I like that movie. I have not played all four DVDs yet, but I only have two complaints. One is the packaging. I was so eager to find the Paris movie that I didn't read how it was packaged (otherwise I wouldnt be mentioning this because if Id read the details, I wouldve known). All four DVDs are connected to the disc clasp (theyre stacked on top of each other). I wouldnt recommend keeping the DVDs together like that because I can see them getting scratched easily. Id recommend keeping one of the DVDs in the box and getting empty CD cases for the other three. Another complaint is that Holiday In The Sun doesnt have English subtitles. This probably doesnt matter to most people, but I like having the option of subtitles. Despite those two complaints, Im definitely glad I bought this.",1527379200,,1251,4.515418502202643
