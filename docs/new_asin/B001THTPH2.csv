8341457,1,B001THTPH2,This might be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not pleased.,1444953600,,68,3.9285714285714284
8341458,4,B001THTPH2,"Saw this while recovering from an injury, and since I teach golf, thought I'd give it a try.  Pretty funny and if you love golf and laughing, for the price, it's a good deal.",1381449600,,174,4.117647058823529
8341459,3,B001THTPH2,"Video on this movie was terrible.  Looks like a 10th generation copy.  Not up to modern standards.  Immature portrait of 4 pals, none of which has anything resembling a golf swing.  Can only compare it to a movie starring Davy Jones and ""The Monkeys"".  Was difficult to watch the first 20 minutes but it picked up after awhile.  Pretty much had to force myself to watch the entire film.  Only reason I did was because there is some substance relating back to my early days of golf with goofy friends.  That was the only meaning this film had for me.  No historic value and no golfing value.  Kind of a VERY poorly done ""Animal House"".  If you golfed with old high school or college friends you might enjoy watching it with them but only the goofiest of friends would say, ""that was great"".  Not really a ""KEEPER"" for my video library.",1370476800,,834,4.450331125827814
8341460,4,B001THTPH2,"Rented this fun independent film because it was an exclusive to my local ""Mr. Movies"" franchise. Really ended up enjoying the movie and it had some really unique points. My girl and I still occasionally celebrate ""white trash day!""",1240185600,,231,4.948717948717949
8341461,4,B001THTPH2,"Full of memorable characters and quotable one-liners! Pop this in the next time your buddies get together for some beers. Great fun with a great cast!

""Dude, I'm so pumped up to chill out!""",1239753600,,190,4.588235294117647
8341462,5,B001THTPH2,One of the wackiest golf stories I've ever seen. This surprising and entertaining melange of film styles points out that it takes much more than a good swing to rack up a good score.,1239667200,,182,4.382352941176471

Says Who?  The Director's Mom?!

For that matter who could possibly have given the positive reviews?  An objective movie viewer-I think not.

Where to Begin?  What was with that golf swing from the lead character?  He had to have been mentally retarded.  I thought he was at first.  And when he opened his mouth to speak it was indeed confirmed.  I have never wanted to kill a character more than that wacky fellow, Langer.  And what was with that 'hot' beverage cart girl? She looked like a dropout from the Special Olympics of Beauty. Good god. Please write my wife a letter explaining to her why her husband will never again achieve an erection.

Hopefully they will make a sequel where the main characters all die in a fiery accident five minutes into it.  Actually I'd like to hope the actors all die in a fiery accident.",1111536000,3,855,4.62
8341464,1,B001THTPH2,"Possibly the single worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life...wait, not possibly. Hacky, Tacky, and Terrible. They couldn't even attribute the lame quote on the cover to a real person. The only redeeming quality about it is that you can mock it mercilessly and get a small amount of joy out of it. Never have I seen its equal. In fact, not only did I hate this movie, but it was so bad as to make me a bit gun-shy about other movies. I don't even feel comfortable in my own skin anymore. Terrible. Terrible. It's like I'm covered in dirt that just won't come off.

Not only have I lost faith in independent movies, but, indeed, mankind altogether. Thanks Mulligan!",1111536000,5,669,4.439024390243903
