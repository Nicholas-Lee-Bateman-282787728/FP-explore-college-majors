8348548,5,B0020MUFK6,I couldn't be happier with this dvd.  The instruction is perfectly suitable for all levels and at 40ish minutes its easy to find time to tackle at home.  I'd suggest it for anyone looking to explore yoga for the first time or for any yogi looking to enhance their practice outside the studio.  FIVE STARS!,1239840000,,305,4.509090909090909
8348549,5,B0020MUFK6,"Of my many Yoga DVDs, this is my favorite.  I love Deborah's approach to Yoga. As I have gone from a complete beginner to more intermediate, this practice has accommodated me from the beginning and still does.  There are still areas I need to modify and she provides great guidance in each case.  I practice with this DVD at least once a week and always look forward to it, even if it sometimes means waking up at 5am to fit it in!",1239840000,,431,4.2317073170731705
8348550,5,B0020MUFK6,"I've been a yoga student of Deborah Burkman's for six years and have even followed her travel class all the way to Bali.  She's a fantastic teacher, imparting just the right balance of physical coaching and philosophic guidance.  Her knowledge of yoga is deep, having studied in India, yet she finds ways of making it accessible to all.  This DVD is a great way to experience her teaching when you're not lucky enough to be in the yoga studio with her!",1239753600,,452,4.555555555555555
