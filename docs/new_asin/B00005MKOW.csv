1625657,3,B00005MKOW,"There is a serious side to Cosi Fan Tutte (after all, the guys play a pretty nasty trick on their fiances), but this production is too solemn and dark, detracting from Mozart's music, some of which is wonderfully comic and much of which is sweet and heavenly. The slow tempo adds to the somber mood. The players seem to be either angry or gloomy most of the time, even the comic character of the maid, Despina.

And then in one of the few scenes that shouldn't be comic, Ferrando and Guglielmo inexplicably engage in silly stage business with their teacups and silverware while Ferrando sings one of Mozart's most beautiful and tender arias, ""Un' aura amorosa."" The production is saved by the powerful voice of Cecilia Bartoli as Fiordiligi and I do appreciate the director's choice to present us with a (literally) chilling final chorus that highlights the characters' disillusionment. If you're looking to buy a DVD of Cosi, I recommend the Theatre du Chatelet production from 1992, John Eliot Gardiner conducting.",1145318400,4,1016,4.906976744186046
1625658,2,B00005MKOW,"I didn't like this version of Cosi Fan Tutte. I love Cecilia Bartoli, but I felt her voice didn't go together well with Nikiteanu's. Maybe it's because they are both mezzo sopranos, I don't know. Also, I didn't think Widmer and Sacca sang their parts well. Agnes Baltsa was excellent as Despina. I think Carlos Chausson did ok for his part, but I had a hard time getting past those devilish eyebrows. It was just weird to me how the Zurich opera house changed the story around. They made Don Alfonso a much darker character and the whole setting (a school) and the weird staging and everything just totally did not work for me. I had a very hard time getting into this production. Thankgoodness I got it from the library first. If you are looking for an excellent Cosi, I suggest the Gardiner version with Amanda Roocroft, Rose Mannion, Rodney Gilfry and Rainer Trost. It is the most beautiful Cosi I know of today.",1144281600,7,915,4.551515151515152
1625659,3,B00005MKOW,"De 'Cos fan tutte' se cuentan a da de hoy unas 7 versiones en dvd, y esta no es la ms interesante de todas. La produccin de J. Flimm sita la accin en tiempos modernos, en 'La escuela de amantes' que sirve de subttulo a la pera mozartiana, con algunas ventajas y algunos inconvenientes en la narracin. El elenco vocal es desigual, destacando el magnfico Don Alfonso de Carlos Chausson, por actuacin y medios vocales, y la muy interesante Fiordiligi que delinea Cecilia Bartoli, con momentos puramente mozartianos y un personaje muy bien construdo. Suficientes la Dorabella de Liliana Nikiteanu (que adems de una voz interesante, tiene a su favor un sex-appeal que la produccin explota) y Roberto Sacc, que, pese a cantar con correccin, no le saca todo el jugo posible a su personaje.

Muy discretos Agnes Baltsa, totalmente fuera de papel como Despina (voz gastada y actuacin por momentos grotesca) y Oliver Widmer como Guiglielmo, que vocalmente est muy flojo.

La direccin de Nikolaus Hartnoncourt es, como casi siempre pasa con l, renovadora e interesante, aunque pueda presentar algn tempo discutible (el 'Per piet' de Fiordiligi es exasperadamente lento).

Para una buena versin de esta pera en dvd es recomendable la de Gardiner en Pars editada por Archiv, aunque esta tenga sus puntos de inters.",1143849600,2,1301,4.986175115207374
1625660,4,B00005MKOW,"Although this title is less wellknown than Mozart's La Nozze de Figaro and Don Giovanni, it is not less melodious and beautiful than the other two operas.
The beauty of the music is emphasized by excellent performance of the singers, especially Cecilia Bartoli with her soft soprano voice as the firm Fiordiligi, the matter of fact and simple maid Despina, performed by Agnes Baltsa with her clear soprano voice and also the clear light tenor voice of Roberto Sacca. The others also contributed much to the performance which made the music so beautiful and enjoyable to watch and listen.
Like all Mozart's music we are enchanted to the really melodious nuance and the excellent singing add to the beauty of it.
We love the divine duets of two sopranos, tenor and baritone which were so harmoniously sang to reflect the magnificent music of Mozart.
One small flaw is only the background scenery which was a bit too constant and simple although it changes now and then.
Nevertheless this performance is really enchanting and made us want to watch and listen until the end.",1061769600,6,1070,4.852459016393443
1625661,2,B00005MKOW,"I must admit that haven't bought this DVD, but this performance was some time back broadcasted twice on Norwegian TV. I thought it would be interesting to watch Bartoli sing one of the sisters. What I found out was that it was a disappointment.
First of all was the conducting tediously slow. And when I saw the first scene with the three men, I started to wonder if it was just me or did the one that played Guglielmo looked and sounded extremely bored. The Ferrando too wasn't too good. He could produce very beautiful tones, but could just hold them for a second and then a hideous vibrator would kick in. I normally love a vibrator under control, but he was truly awful to listen to. The only male performer that was very good, was the Don Alfonso. He acted and sounded the part very well.
But something I just don't understand, was why on earth would the producer or conductor cast two mezzo sopranos as the sisters. As much as I love Cecila Bartoli's Rosina and Cenerentola, she is no Fiordiligi. She was much too low range for her, although her coloratura is gorgous. The one that played Dorabella sang well, but she seemed to have an even lower range than Baroli. It just didn't seem right to me. They were very pleasant to hear, but definatly not good for the dramatic effect. Agnes Baltsa's Despina was pure joy see both see and listen to.
It is strange that the conductor would choose such an extremely slow tempo. It made the drama go with incrediblely short steps. It seemed to go on forever. And it made the opera almost boring to see, interupted by occational comic touches here and there. Neither Mozart's nor Da Ponte's humor made it through for me. I lated bought the Gardiner version on DVD and that was something else. All six singers were exceptional, the conducting was crisp, well timed and made the opera a joy to see. This one was very boring by comparsion.",1036022400,14,1882,4.505847953216374
1625662,5,B00005MKOW,"DVD was made for opera and none more so than this gem.  With any Mozart opera it is important that an ensemble sings together rather like a rich tapestry, and so the delight of this production was how wonderfully these voices entertwined.  The production was imaginative, and the intimacy of this small Zurich opera house also made this seem like a more personal event.  Cecilia has never been better!  And that is saying something!",1005523200,6,432,4.797297297297297
1625663,2,B00005MKOW,"I am truly disappointed purchasing this DVD.  Although the cast is excellent, especially Baltsa as Despina, the conducting is truly disappointed.  Too slow, stretching this work way way too long, and have unusual musical pause.  If you love the Ostman version, you would be bore to death with this one.  This is Mozart a la Hannoncourt, unusual.  I am thinking of donating my DVD to the local library.....",1000771200,13,405,4.897058823529412
1625664,5,B00005MKOW,"Mozart's Cos&igrave; fan tutte contains some of his sweetest and most beautiful melodies. Such gorgeous music combined with an excellent libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte make it hard to believe that this opera was largely neglected by the public until the twentieth century. Viewing this DVD is a true delight from beginning to end, as Harnoncourt conducts Mozart's gem just right. The cast is outstanding, made up of a mixture of world-famous singers like Bartoli and Baltsa and others that, while not as well known, bring their characters to life. Even the recitatives are expertly done, thus adding to the humor and the drama of the opera. This production brilliantly conveys the humor on the surface, while at the same time illustrating that just below is a darker world with real tears and pathos as the four lovers discover that true love isn't necessarily forever. The sound and picture quality are excellent, and no fan of Mozart will want to be without this superb DVD. I know this opera well, and this production was enlightening to me on a musical, intellectual, and emotional level that stayed with me long after viewing it.",998524800,26,1132,4.901041666666667
1625665,5,B00005MKOW,"Aaah...DVD for opera is a fantastic medium since it offers action besides music. And here Harnoncourt is at his best here, offers a rendition really complete, musically and theatrically. Recitatives fresh and interesting for once, here we get the whole picture with all the colours of Mozart`s paint-box. A laugh and a cry at the same time, this performance offers a picture of LIFE, with basically normal people with the same drams, hopes, envies and jealousies that we all have. The result is confrontational, but, then again, isn`t Harncourt allways.... Nikiteanu/Bartoli superb, Widmer excellent. A must for opera lovers.",997747200,8,625,5.3232323232323235
1625666,5,B00005MKOW,"Mozart's <Cosi fan tutte> has had a spotted career on video, but I believe that the ArtHaus edition (100 013) is the best of the lot if considered in the light of Opera as Theatre. For once, the dry recites are done with imagination, using something never heard in opera houses: silence. The scene in which the two sisters and their disguised wooers are seated awkwardly at a table and one of them breaks the ice with ""Nice day, isn't it?"" gets a bigger laugh than all the silliness in other productions.
 We have here the moralistic tale of two young men, Ferrando (Roberto Sacca) and Guilelmo (Oliver Widmer), betting the older and cynical Don Alfonso (Carlos Chausson) that their lovers, Fiordiligi (Cecilia Bartoli) and Dorabella (Liliana Nikiteanu), are constant. With the aid of the clever maid Despina (Agnes Baltsa), each woos the other's beloved--and both succeed! All around, some unpleasant truths are learned about themselves and only Don Alfonso emerges unscathed.
 Since the subtitle of this work is ""The School for Lovers,"" we have in this production Don Alfonso actually running a classroom for young men; and several scenes take place in front of the blackboard, which is a prop put to very good use throughout. Never mind that the disguises on the men would fool no one and that at least two pieces on the stage are anachronistically modern. The acting is good, with Bartoli overdoing the facial expressions a little as usual, and the singing of some of the six participants perhaps less than spectacular but always within character. I am recommending this highly as an excellent piece of Theatre and a very good introduction to an opera that lives in the shadow of ""Figaro"" and ""Don Giovanni.""
 The work is on two DVDs in the 16:9 screen ratio. The jacket lists a running time of 275 minutes, which includes a 22-minute ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette. No libretto but a good synopsis.",995587200,35,1903,4.849230769230769
7945619,5,B00005MKOW,"The staging is a bit bizarre at points, and Agnes Baltsa isn't my first choice for Despina, however--this production of Cosi is worth owning simply to hear some of Bartoli's best singing. Yes, it is darker and more solemn than a typical Cosi, but I feel like it heightened the beauty of the score. The quintet ""Di scrivermi ogni giorno"" was at about half tempo to what I'm used to, and I'm hard pressed to think of a more stunning moment in an opera production. Harnoncourt makes smart musical choices, while also not trying to reinvent the wheel. I hated what they did to ""un aura"", but otherwise the staging was subtle and visually appealing.",1492214400,,644,4.608695652173913
7945620,4,B00005MKOW,The Zurich production of this opera is not quite perfect. The stage setting is too dark for a buffa. The production is not as tight and funny as the one by Glyndebourne or as charming and pleasing as the one by VOH. Baltsa is a miscast as Despina. She doesn't have any sense of humor. The handling of the ending with Despina leaving is not appropriate for a buffa that ends in happiness for all.,1469232000,,395,4.28
7945621,5,B00005MKOW,"I loved it because of Cecilia Bartoli.  But, like lots of operas, be prepared for a ridiculous plot.
Back then (has anything changed...I hope so!) they assumed that women would be unfaithful.  Pushed to the limits, these gals finally respond to the absurdities presented.  Dumb...but I loved Bartoli anyhow.

7945622,5,B00005MKOW,I thoroughly enjoyed this vibrant and different interpretation of this Mozart opera. Cecilia Bartoli has never been better than she is here as Fiordiligi.  The Zurich Opera may be small but it performs this opera very well.,1346371200,,223,5.027027027027027
7945623,3,B00005MKOW,"I am very careful about how to put it. I bought this production for two reasons; 1)I was exposed to some scene of this opera of MET production where Bartoli played Despina, and having never seen this opera, I loved it. And 2) I adore Bartoli. Personally (just a personal feeling) I was a little disappointed. Probably the first reason is that it's not a big scale production like MET. Then after seeing Bartoli's perfect comic performance of Despina and Susanna of Figaro, Baltsa is not funny or vivacious enough. Generally it was not as funny as the MET production. But Don Alfonso has a beautiful voice and is funny too. The tenor voice was very beautiful also. Bartoli is a great singer and performer but she's much better as Despina. Another weird thing, in the first song of Act 2, some part is missing and I don't know why, because it's a funny part.

Well, it's just me. But you might like it. It's a small and friendly set and generally they are good singers, but I feel that they didn't have enough space or fancy sets where they can really spread their wings and act comedy.",1271376000,,1084,4.474747474747475
7945624,5,B00005MKOW,"This is a great performance, better sung and almost as good theatrically as the Peter Sellars Cosi which is one of the great performances of ANY opera.  The direction is intelligent, sensitive and funny; the directoral concept (the use of classroom objects - a whiteboard - to mirror the ""school"" for lovers) admirable.  The singers carry out the concept beautifully; all are comically talented,  with especial praise to Carlos Chausson and Liliana Nikitenau, whose ability to sing very well while moving her body robotically to great comic purpose while using her eyes to comment on the robotic use of her body is a wonder.  And as one of the other reviewers noted, the director and singers make especially good use of the recitative; here, it is genuinely funny.  And then there is Cecilia Bartoli, who sings extraordinarily well (except for her very top notes) and is especially lovely, tender, and moving in her softer passages.  But most interesting, are the several great moments, when Harnoncourt and Bartoli allow her to slow the music down (out of tempo) to create what Julius Katchen called ""magical moments"" in which we are outside of time and all the beauty that is in Mozart's conception is embodied in the body, voice, and soul that is Bartoli. In our current understanding of period practice, these moments are wrong.  If so, our concepts are wrong, for these are visions of beauty and glory and we are fortunate to have them.",1247961600,,1441,4.881147540983607
7945625,5,B00005MKOW,"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was the greatest composer of all time. Among his 626 extraordinary compositions his operas and piano concerti stand out as his  best work, and are also the key to understand Mozart's musical language. Among his operas the three da Ponte operas stand out as the best ever written. All three are about Mozart's favorite subject, also the favorite subject of every great artist, and everyone with a heart: love. Among the three great Mozart - Da Ponte  collaborations, Cosi Fan Tutte is the funniest, most extraordinary Opera. It is an ensemble Opera -- there are few solo arias. Instead we have a succession of duets, trios, quartets, quintets, sextets, and each is in itself an extraordinary masterpiece.

Mozart is unique among all great Opera composers in one particular Mozartian aspect: He is able to weave into a harmonious whole any combination of completely disparate emotions, each perfectly expressed in the music. One character may feel joy, while another may feel angry, another  about to burst into laughter, another  anguished, it does not matter -- Mozart will put all of them in the same piece of music, and all of them will be expressed in the music perfectly. This extraordinary ability to put into music every human emotion and combine it into one harmonious whole is unique to Mozart. No one ever came even close to be able to do the same.

Harnoncourt's reading with a cast of superb singer-actors of Cosi Fan Tutte is thoroughly enjoyable. There are other available versions of this magnificent Opera, some arguably even better. Yet if you love music and love Mozart, I think that you will not be disappointed in this particular reading. The acting and staging is excellent. The singing and playing first rate. The tempos -- well it is Harnoncourt! A little idiosynchratic, but it works. More on this later.

Whenever I rate a Cosi Fan Tutte I always go to the two most beautiful pieces of music in the  whole Opera repertoire. The wonderful magical Quintet, ""Mi Scriva Ogni Giorno"" (Write to me every day) followed a few minutes later by the extraordinary Trio ""Soave sia il vento"" (Let the winds be gentle).

The quintet happens dramatically after the men bet with Don Alfonso on the outcome of a test of the women's constancy, promising to  follow his directions for one day. Don Alfonso brings the terrible (fake) news, that the king ordered the men into battle and they must leave immediately to the women. The Quintet is the goodbye of the four lovers combined with interjections of Don Alfonso that he will burst into laughter if this goes on any longer. It is an example of what I wrote above of Mozart combining perfectly disparate emotions into a harmonious whole.  Harnoncourt takes this a little bit too slow - I think that it would be even  more beautiful, and would work dramatically better, if his tempo was a little faster. But Mozart's music works no matter what tempo, and in fact the acting is so good that it works dramatically as well.

This little piece of music is so extraordinary that it is worth taking it apart second by second. Fiordiligi starts while  loving caresses are expressed in the violins with magical pizzicato accompaniment and chords. She sings: Write me every day ... twice if you can, but she sings it haltingly, syllable by syllable, because she is meant to be unable to sing it normally, she is supposed to be crying. Her lover answers the same way, Don't doubt it... Then she sings in a most extraordinary musical line: Be constant to me alone... to which Dorabella adds : Be faithful... to which the men sing  in sequence Addio (Goodbye) Addio (Goodbye) to which the women respond in an inverted melody A... ddiio, signifying a stab in the heart, it's all just magical, breathtakingly beautiful music, expressing the loving sentiments of the departing lovers. It could be said that the men of course know that this is all fake, but Mozart tells us in the music that they are caught up in the moment, for their emotions are of genuine love, just like the women's. But Don Alfonso, on the other hand, observes all of this, and finds it irresistibly funny. He too knows that it is fake, so he sings ""Io creppo si non rido"" (I will burst if I don't laugh). Cresson's acting while he sings the line is superb.

A few minutes later the men have embarked and the three (Don Alfonso, Fiordiligi and Dorabella) wish them good journey in another extraordinarily beautiful pieca of music: Soave sia il vento. The words are almost banal: Let the winds be gentle, let the waves be tranquil, and let all elements  cooperate for  a safe journey, that is our desire. But what an extraordinary piece of music Mozart makes out of it! As always, the orchestra paints the big picture and sets the moood: The waves are expressed in the violins the singing starts magical, almost like a prayer. The lines succeed each other in heavenly music of infinite beauty, until we come to ""desir..."" (desire). When this word is reached, Mozart adds a marvelously beautiful dissonant chord, which expresses a tugging on the heart -- expressing perhaps the pain of separation, and perhaps simultaneously also sexual desire -- which is then resolved in release of tension.

Harnoncourt's tempo is now a bit too fast -- the waves in the violins seem rushed rather than tranquil -- but once again the music is so extraordinarily beautiful that it works at any tempo.

The rest of the opera follows more or less the same patterns. As I said, this may not be the very best available version of Cosi Fan Tutte, clearly that is also a matter of preference and taste, but it is thoroughly enjoyable, and therefore I recommend it.",1238889600,3,5677,4.744162436548224
7945626,5,B00005MKOW,"`Cosi fan tutte' is as rich as life itself and this production does it justice. Production really is the word, because the performance offers much more than excellent singers and fine orchestra. The stage direction, sets, and costumes deserve as much praise as the musicians. From the first minutes of the overture--when the rippling deep blue seems the perfect color for this opera--to the stunning finale, sets and lighting work in unison with the music. It is refreshing to see a production that abandons the `girls in pink lace' kinds of conventions that sometimes plague Mozart performances. The darker, more abstract and more intense color palette is far more appealing. It creates an atmosphere that is at once vibrant and alluringly intimate. The sets are never needlessly complicated, although it certainly took a great deal of thought and expense to create them. The visual language of the stage always follows the musical language of the opera. The final scene is absolutely brilliant. Watch it; you will learn from it. Nikolaus Harnoncourt's conducting is wondrously perceptive. The orchestra is present just as much as it needs to be without ever overpowering the singers. The performance flows with beguiling natural elegance. Among the very strong cast, I took especially to Roberto Sacca as Ferrando, Cecilia Bartoli as Fiordiligi, and, most of all, Liliana Nikiteanu as Dorabella. Nikiteanu is a riot! Dorabella's roving eye, her lust for life, and her stiffening disillusionment at the end--all are executed perfectly.  Nikiteanu's acting is worthy of a Chekhov play and her husky voice suits the role marvellously. All in all, a thoughtful and achingly beautiful performance.",1205712000,2,1694,5.274074074074074
7945627,5,B00005MKOW,"To hear Cecilia Bartoli sing ""Come scoglio"" and ""Per pieta, ben mio, perdona"" was a sufficient reason for me to purchase this DVD.  She was truly outstanding.",1193702400,,158,4.851851851851852
7945628,3,B00005MKOW,"I did not think it would be possible to be disappointed in an opera which starred the superb Cecilia Bartoli in the role of Fiordiligi, but so it was. I felt that much of the direction here was off-kilter, and the staging somehow failed to convey that this is not a big dramatic opera. Yes, there are intended to be very moving moments, but in essence Cos fan tutte is intended to be a comic opera.

Somehow the directing didn't portray this. And as good as Cecilia Bartoli was in singing this role, I felt she was forced into too serious a mould as Fiordiligi.

This performance has one of the worst Dorabellas I've ever seen. I literally had to stop this DVD about a third of the way through because I could not tolerate Liliana Nikiteanu's incessant over-acting any more. The panting, the grimaces, the melodrama without grace... it lacked the bite and subtlety of the really good Dorabellas. I kept thinking how wonderful Bartoli herself would be in this plum of a role. And Nikiteanu simply hasn't the voice to cope. What a dreadful shame - it really was Ms Nikiteanu who made much of this opera DVD intolerable.

Agnes Baltsa is mostly delightful as Despina, except when close-ups show that she is perhaps not quite young enough to portray this sort of role. Had the camera-work been cleverer, this would not have been a problem.

The men... well, they were quite reasonable, but not outstanding.

The trouble is this: no one else in the cast comes close to Bartoli's vocal prowess, except for Baltsa. This simply makes the performance seem very lopsided. Add to this a very silly cast choice for the Dorabella (a PIVOTAL role!) and a director who has clearly gone in for gloom and doom, and this performance simply does not work on several levels.

I would recommend in preference to this DVD the utterly beautiful version with Gruberova, or the Gardiner version with Roocroft etc. Both of these are charming, delightful, delicious and wonderfully sung.",1152489600,10,1960,4.716374269005848
