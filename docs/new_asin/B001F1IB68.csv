For anyone who cares about about seeing films in their proper aspect ratio, DO NOT RENT THIS VERSION.  Stopped watching after 5 minutes.",1526256000,,248,5.024390243902439
8300584,2,B001F1IB68,"This is a typical low-cost shoot-em-up of its time -- much better films of this sort exist.
Which may have been intended as a satire. Sadly, it's not satirical /enough/ to carry that out.
Which leaves it looking like a potpourri of ideas stolen from other movies, in which they may have made a bit more sense, but probably not very much, as they weren't all that good to begin with.
Still, it's not as bad as, say, /Reindeer Games/ by the same director.",1520812800,,453,4.404761904761905

8300589,3,B001F1IB68,"Basically, the film is the age-old theme of a struggle for power between two rival gangs, one led by Uncle Frank (Edmond O'Brien) and the other by Big Eddie (Bradford Dillman). Uncle Frank hires professional killer Harry Crown (Richard Harris), while Big Eddie sends for Marvin ""Claw"" Zuckerman (Chuck Connors).

People get shot, dynamited, beaten up and blown sky-high... There's a whole bordello full of beautiful gir1s called ""Dolly's Incorporated"" and plenty of fighting between Harris and Connors...

The mixture as before? Well, yes, except that Frankenheimer has tended to film this as a satire on gangsters...

The gangster film has changed, because gangsters themselves have changed... Al Capone is long dead... The Godfather, Scarface, The Last Don, The Untouchables have taken his place... Edward G. Robinson has gone and Cagney too...

But the gangster film will continue. ""Get this, pal - it'll kill you."" It sure will...",1232755200,,934,5.29054054054054
