8612340,3,B00F4YS7WU,"I like the content, as I read through the list of movies, of this set, but unfortunately, three of the four movies on the first disc I played had virtually no sound output.  I could hear the sound on the fourth movie just fine and could hear the loop soundtrack on the DVD's home (select movie) screen just fine.  I spot checked the four movies on Disc 2 and found audible sound on all four.
As has been mentioned elsewhere, these are not restored movies and as such, video and audio quality varies.  However, not having any sound on three of the first features was a deal-breaker for me.  Contacting the seller (fulfilled by Amazon) was no help.  I'd hoped to learn if anyone else had mentioned these low or no audio output issues but was simply told to contact Amazon for a refund  I returned this set to Amazon - no problem with the return for full refund.",1490227200,3,859,4.371069182389937
