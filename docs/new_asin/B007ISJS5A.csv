5089719,1,B007ISJS5A,"There was little information on the ""Heroes"" etc.  This was mainly just a video of reenactors marching around with a person giving a VERY skimpy overview of the historic facts.  It wasn't worth even the low price which it was sold for. VERY boring!",1372550400,2,248,4.613636363636363
5089720,4,B007ISJS5A,"I found this disk to entertaining.  As a reenactor myself, was able to find many familiar faces in the footage.  But as a history lesson, the disk is lacking a lot of the usual talking we are all accustomed to in videos of this sort.  Instead this video uses the imagery of the reenactors engaged in ""battle"" to tell the story.  Unfortunately, if you do not know the battle well, you are left with many questions.  It's not uncommon during the four episodes to listen to narration for 15 seconds and then watch reenactors for 3-4 minutes with no dialogue at all.  It feels disjointed at times, but then again the actual imagery is a lot of fun to watch.  This makes it a tough call for me.  Video is fun, but the dialogue, the ""history lesson"" is lacking.  For the price I paid and the fun footage, I give it 4 stars.",1364601600,,817,4.287581699346405
5089721,2,B007ISJS5A,This did not hold the kids attention. It was very redondent for the battles. I showed a few minutes of the segments we were working on.,1364428800,,135,4.230769230769231
5089722,3,B007ISJS5A,"Video is repetitive and slow.  Would have been better with better narration and some maps.
""The Revolution"" is far better.",1364256000,,122,5.1

If you are interested in only the uniforms and the weapondry of the Revolutionary War, this might be worth its $4.49 price to you. However, if you want to know something about the ""Heroes and Battles"" of that war, this will be a great disappointment. I just finished suffering through all four parts, and while the last part (The First American Army"" has some educational value, it's just not worth watching. While watching the video, I kept thinking of nasty things I would say in my review, but I finally realized that it's not worth the trouble. It's just a lot of nothing, tedious and boring nothing. Basically, except for the last part, the video can be summed up as scenes of scenes of soldiers and their weapons standing, drilling, walking, running, attacking and retreating, and when I say ""attacking and retreating"" don't get the idea that you'll be seeing exciting battle scenes. Quite the contrary; in fact, it almost looks like they used the same scenes to accompany and illustrate all  of the different battles. They seem interchangeable. They add nothing to an understanding of what actually happened. Well, it's only $4.49, so I've already said too much. If it had just come out, and it were selling for $29.95, it would deserve a full-blown demolition job, but it's only $4.95, and it proves again that you get what you pay for. In closing, I can only add that the thought ""My DVD must be missing the narrative track"" kept occurring to me. True, the sounds of muskets firing were always present, but it was hard to believe that the director, editor, etc. could have allowed such long stretches of repetitious nothingness without any comment or explanation.  How, and why, was such a film made?

In a film purporting to be about battles, there were no battle maps and no diagrams of any kind. You learn nothing from this video. Don't waste your money, even if it is only $4.49.",1338508800,13,2076,5.117994100294985
5089724,5,B007ISJS5A,"I am biased, but great care was taken to portray the battles and events of the American Revolution, covered in these documentaries, as accurately and with as much historical fact as possible.  These films were shot at large-scale and authentic re-enactments and feature thousands of re-enactors.  A great value at this price and an ideal product for all educators, museums and teachers and for all ages.",1328140800,,403,5.090909090909091
5089725,1,B007ISJS5A,"What a waste of time. The four videos consist of war re-enactments with a tiny amount of voice-over explanation of the battle. We see endless shots of re-enactors firing their weapons. Over and over.

I rate this five stars for the handful of re-enactors who are featured; they get a well-made home movie. One star for the rest of us who want to learn something about American Revolutionary War battles.

A total waste of time and money.",1326758400,12,437,4.662337662337662
5089726,1,B007ISJS5A,"The DVD case for ""The Revolutionary War: Heroes and Battles"" has a nice portrait of George Washington on the cover. And that about sums up the good points of this production.  Said case is sized to fit four DVDs (""4 documentary set""), but contains only one DVD which holds all four presentations.  The productions themselves consist of amateur quality video shot at Revolutionary War re-enactments, haphazardly edited, with intermittent and uninspired narration.

Many excellent Revolutionary War documentaries exist, my own favorite being ""Liberty!""  Save your money on ""Heroes and Battles"" and apply it toward a better product.",1314403200,24,629,5.453608247422681

8517769,1,B007ISJS5A,This was not what I expected it to be.  I thought it would be more of a movie instead of just a bunch of re-enactments of those battles.  There was no dialogue explaining what was happening.  Very disappointing.,1392595200,3,211,4.5
8517770,4,B007ISJS5A,I was not sure what this was about but the first 3 episodes on the battles are actual footage of the reenactments. I got lost on what was happening because it had very little narration so the viewer got lost on the battle progressions. The fourth part Von Stuebens Army was narrated very well and I learned a lot form that episode. It is worth the money but the first 3 episodes are short on history and you will not learn much from them. But the uniforms and the weapons were fun to watch.,1391385600,,490,4.223404255319149
