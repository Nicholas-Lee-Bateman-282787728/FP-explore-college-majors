7927650,1,B00004YS7S,"Seth - The Hard Way. (The hard way to what?)
Why did I only give this DVD a One Star? - Because there is No Zero Star.
I have a small collection of Freestyle Motocross DVDs and this one I got rid of.
As someone said to Seth - he has ""issues to work out"".
It shows him trying some crazy - long distance jump - the bike breaks in two.
He like splits his head too - and requires like life saving surgery.
I guess he is proud of this?? This is where I don't see any point to watching him.
I like Pastrana - he is amazing. He has spectacular jumps and crashes - but Seth Enslow just seems to be a cross between a semi-talented free-styler and Johnny Knoxsville on a a death wish - and I guess he wants us to cheer him on??
I think it's just tragic - and I hope he does get some help.
Either way - there are better DVDs out there.

7927651,5,B00004YS7S,"If you like freestyle motocross and long jumps, this is definitely a DVD for you.  Not only is the footage from his world record attempt (and resulting injury) on here, but a tonne of footage of his crashes too.  I also loved how they included some quick clips of his fun in various other sports (flipping a truck, snowmobiling, snowboarding, etc)
Lots of extras, some medical info/clips (on various serious injuries), and more!
A great DVD, but it's too bad it's out of print...grab a copy while you can!",1075161600,,505,4.662921348314606
7927652,5,B00004YS7S,"Seth rocks, this video is awesome, the best, and those who think that not showing it to their kids is a good thing, I mean please who are they kidding, would they rather them be watching Seth on a bike or big arnie shooting someone up or some homeboy selling drugs in half of the hollywood flicks today, I hate to shock them but kids have seen it all, a motocross video will do nothing to them, this one will however amaze them",1063929600,,427,4.156626506024097
7927653,1,B00004YS7S,"If I could give zero stars I would.  I agree with the review by Ken L.
If you have kids DO NOT buy this video.  Seth Enslow is  reckless & irresponsible. Not the guy to be your kids hero.
McGrath, Carmichael, Pastrana etc., are guys you can look up to.  Great riders, professional, responsible......",1027382400,5,299,4.481481481481482
7927654,1,B00004YS7S,"THIS FILM HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH MOTORCYCLING AND MORE TO DO ABOUT SETH AND HIS WANABEE GANGSTER FRIENDS. SETH BEHAVES LIKE A PUNK IN THIS VIDEO, KIDS LOOK UP TO HIM, AND HE HAS LET THEM DOWN, HE HAS SHOWN THAT HE IS NOT WORTH LOOKING UP TO. IN ONE SCENE HIM AND HIS ""POSSE"" ARE WALKING DOWN THE STREET HOLDING ASSAULT RIFLES, WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH MOTORCYCLING?? I ADVISE AGAINST BUYING HIS VIDEO, GIVE YOUR MONEY TO TRAVIS OR MCGRATH",1007164800,12,448,4.22093023255814
7927655,5,B00004YS7S,"I've never seen a viedo where someone jibs so much.  Seth is a god.  If you have seen any of the crusty videos then your going to love ""The hard way"".  He just hucks it so much bigger then anyone ever has.  There is just something awsome about going for the record jump on a motorbike and getting crushed.  Check out slednecks if your into people huckin it huge.  It was cool,  big truck.",1006214400,2,388,4.162162162162162
7927656,3,B00004YS7S,"Seth rules, but it could've had more.  But.....  Gotta get the video just because it's all of the coolest jumps from the other videos all in one.  If you collect the Crusty's, you'll get to see all the jumps you said ""SON OF A!!!!"" to, all in one.  The one downfall is that.. if you collect Crusty's, you've seen most of it already...... but not in a row!!!",996105600,5,357,4.205882352941177
7927657,5,B00004YS7S,If you are a dirt biker its a most see. From when he started to when he was simply amazing. See him jump his death difiing  249 foot jump witch leaves him with 50 stapls in his head. I strongly recomend this dirt biking biography.,978652800,2,230,4.111111111111111
7927658,5,B00004YS7S,"I have both the DVD and the VHS of this video.  The VHS is good for the footage, but the DVD rocks.  The DVD provides extra info, segments and insights to Seth and his wild motorcycle jumps.  You get the info on the big crash, how Seth sees himself and a host of other goodies (Including an interactive segment on what he has broken.)
This DVD includes interviews with the makers of Crusty Demons of Dirt (1-4, 2000 & 6).  Comments from other professional riders (which is not positive, but really funny) give other peoples feelings on Seth and the rider he is.  Finally see the crash out in Antelope Valley, CA in '99 that put a big hole in his head.
If you like motorcycle movies, and enjoy the ""Free Riding"" crusty types, the video is not going to fully please.  But if you want to see the inside to Seth and how this guy has no self preservation skills, then you got to have it.
Long live the freaks....",976147200,6,907,4.2748538011695905
