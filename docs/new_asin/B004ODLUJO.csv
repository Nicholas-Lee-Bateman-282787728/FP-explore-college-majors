8437126,5,B004ODLUJO,"Nakamura Kinnosuke was one of the best actors in Japan while I was living there from 1956 to 1971. When he was in a movie, you could depend on it being good. ""Revenge"" (Adauchi in Japanese) is an excellent movie. If you like Japanese swordplay movies (chambara), you will find ""Revenge"" very satisfying.",1416787200,5,303,4.735849056603773
8437127,5,B004ODLUJO,"A great store of samurai honor and duels gone awry. Honor that demands vengeance quickly goes to far and everything gets out of hand destroying the lives of two samurai houses. By the end all are in shock and desperately trying to put an end to the insanity, as they can not believe the level it has reached they find themselves helpless to stop it. Increasingly horrifying and heinous events take place that culminate in the shame of all those whom finally end it rather than a restoration of honor. Don't worry I didn't spoil it, this review ... I just can't do it justice even if I told you the entire movie scene by scene. Excellent classic samurai drama.",1414886400,5,659,4.5
8437128,3,B004ODLUJO,Good film. Shows that a family member can destroy a whole family by not having self control. Reminds me of my own brother.,1414368000,,122,4.3478260869565215

8437131,4,B004ODLUJO,"In the low quality Samurai movies there is to much chop chop. A real Samurai hero spends most of the film worrying about all sorts of stuff. Only at the very end will he burst into action.

The plot in this movie rings true. Our protagonist stumbles into a duel which leads him to another duel which he tries desparately to avoid. All of this lands him in an official ""Revenge"" duel which he is ordered to lose. He's totally innocent but he obeys. He grinds off the edge of his Katana. He plans to enter the dueling grounds and be murdered. There is a long slow build up to this final scene. It's very powerful and effective. This film compares favorably with ""The Twilight Samurai"" of a few years ago.

I helps to understand a little of the history of the Tokogawa Shogunate.",1339200000,9,776,4.381944444444445
