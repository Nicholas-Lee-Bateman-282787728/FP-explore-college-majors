2139944,5,B0002Y4SJS,"I would have to say that the American Teenage population has completely misjudged the series. We all thought Yu-Gi-Oh was another version of Pokemon-stupid, pathetic, and a first class merchandise distributor. I was like them, for a time. That was, until I got my hands on the `original' series of Yu-Gi-Oh. The un-cut version is completely different from the Four Kids edited version. While the other one was designed to fit younger viewers, the un-cut version will surely inspire anyone who is beyond the age of twelve. This product is rated 13 and up for mild language, blood and gore, religious implications, death, some scary moments and human sacrifice. Of course, the version I currently own is the Anime Video ""AV"" series-, which has poorly manufactured subtitles and some cut-off episodes. These professional episodes are well done-however, I know very little regarding the English track. I have little faith that the English track will be any good (after seeing the actor's most recent job-the Yu-Gi-Oh Movie 2004)-but I have some hope. I am willing to give them a shot at it.

It is very different from the USA Yu-Gi-Oh; a key point being that the so-called ""SHADOW REALM"" doesn't even EXIST in this series. In addition-- Pegasus never wanted the Millennium Puzzle/Sen-Nen Puzzle from Yuugi-- he just wanted Kaiba Corporation.

It is kind of a relief, because even if the English Track is a failure, you don't have to worry about Weevil/Inspector Haga's creaky voice and Joey/Jounouchi's New York accent. On the other hand, you have Pegasus's high-pitched voice to deal with (despite how weird it sounds-- it is actually quite funny-- Coodos to Takusugi J Jirou) and trust me--it'll scare your pets away and (if you play it several times such as I did) annoy your older sister until no end. ^__^

If you like Yu-Gi-Oh and every aspect of it, then by all means, purchase the DVD (and the Shadow Games along with it).  Trust me-- it will be worth more than any American Yu-Gi-Oh merchandise you've got.",1095984000,18,2011,4.905882352941177
2139945,5,B0002Y4SJS,"This is the second of the two DVDs that will be out on October 19th. I have been waiting for these DVDs, refusing to get the dubbed DVDs that are out now, and it has finally paid off. The episodes on this DVD by description are the two Inscector Haga vs. Mou Hitori no Yugi duels, and the Kajuka Mai vs. Katsuya Jonouchi duel. These are episodes 4-6. They also include a edited dub-track which is similar to the original Japanese script, and, as everyone who loves anime wants, a Japanese audio track. This DVD also contains things never seen in the aired version, such as brief nudity, violence, and many other things. But also, it has the changed dialouge, which is a plus in some cases. This DVD also (hopefully) has the original opening and ending themes, Voice by cloud, and Genki no SHAWAA(Energy Shower) by Aki Maeda, both great themes for this first season of Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters.

Warning: Ages 13 and up for violence, brief nudity, religious themes, and mild language.",1095811200,5,982,4.64367816091954
2139946,5,B0002Y4SJS,"For the first time in the United States, 4Kids will be releasing Uncut Yu-Gi-Oh! DVDs. These include the ORIGINAL JAPANESE VERSION, so those who don't like the English voices can listen to the Japanese voices. This DVD contains three episodes: ""The Insector Combo"", ""The Perfectly Ultimate Combo"", and ""Mai's Beautiful Harpies"". The episode titles are different from the previous DVDs to match with the Japanese version. By the way, these DVDs are UNCUT, with no changes made. This DVD will be released alongside ""The Shadow Games"". I reccomend both to any Yu-Gi-Oh! fan.

Note to Parents: These DVDs are completely Uncut, which means that violence, swearing, and some mild nudity (but don't worry, not much is ever showing... most of the time, the nudity will be covered up by the said monster's wings).",1093478400,7,804,5.045112781954887
2139947,5,B0002Y4SJS,"The japanese version was much more gruesome and I'd love a chance to see how it was.  The bonus here is, I don't have to lose my favorite voice actors, there will be a COMPLETE ENGLISH dub track that more closely follows the japanese script.

Warning, this DVD is not for everybody, it involves the following:

Blood, Death, Hideous decapitation of monsters as well as other gruesome imagery, Nudity ( some yugioh cards originally came with nude female monsters, but clothes were drawn on them for the english audiences and standards of practices.) and even fowl language.

Despite that, this DVD will be very unlike the episodes you've seen on TV, every die hard fan of yugioh will enjoy this DVD, but remember it's only recommended for ages 14 and up, maybe even 18 and up ... it depends if your children are mature enough to understand what they're seeing.

I'm personally going to buy every single battle city episode once they come out, but the duelist kingdom episodes just aren't my thing.",1093478400,8,996,4.734104046242774
8034455,4,B0002Y4SJS,"You only get 3 episodes but there good and uncut the way yugioh was suppose to be. 3 of the only 9 episodes you will ever see of dubed uncut yugioh. This is due to Konami reviving 4k media to make edited Yugioh so they can promote there children's trading cards to kids. The problem is Censorship laws is more regulated in the US. So, 4kids/4k media/Konami has to pretty much destroy almost all aspects of the original Japanese version.",1521936000,,436,4.4625

8034458,5,B0002Y4SJS,Great DVD Glad to see the original story and intent of Yu-Gi-Oh with the voice actors I grew up to love. I just wish they were able to continue making all these as they would have made a great collection.,1409011200,,204,4.125
8034459,3,B0002Y4SJS,"While I give it 4 stars for what this release represents, a chance to own an uncut version of a beloved anime, I have to give it 3 stars based on my own personal enjoyment. I'll just come out and say it.

I don't think the cut dub is as bad as people make it out to be.

In truth,this release proves to me there is such a thing as being too close to the original script. The dialogue doesn't flow as naturally as it did in the 4kids cut dub and often feels a little stiff. I'm sure I heard Weevil say 'Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth' 3 times in the same 10 seconds of dialogue. Also because it sticks religiously close to the Japanese script, the mouth flaps don't match up to the dialogue as well and at times it feels like the voice actors were stretching out what they're saying leading to a feeling of disconnection between the voice and character.

Still, I am proud to have this release on my shelf. It's the first time the original Japanese track has been officially released in the west and that alone makes this release worthwhile. I also like how the technical details of the Duelist Kingdom competition were explained better in the uncut dub and emotional moments, specifically when Joey talks about his sister, come accross as especially heartfelt.

So still a great buy!",1388880000,,1282,4.4425531914893615
8034460,5,B0002Y4SJS,Wish they had kepted it going  with the uncut eps.  But its ok. At less we got 3 Vol's  4 if you could the limited Vol 4 that was pulled less then a week after released,1360368000,,168,3.611111111111111
8034461,5,B0002Y4SJS,"Finally, I got to see the first few episode of Yugioh in their original design and language. I still prefer the dubbing they used in the U.S., but the Japanese audio was cool, too. Weevil (Haga) was a little different in this volume than in the edited version. In the U.S., they described him as like a total cheater; that was sort of half true in this version.
 There was going to be a 4th volume released, but they cancelled it so it wouldn't compete with the selling of the edited DVDs. Maybe if we try hard, we can convince 4Kids to release the other episodes. The wife of Dan Green gave birth to twins last year, so I'm sure he needs to look after them for a while before going back to the studio for dubbing.",1339804800,,714,4.211678832116788
8034462,4,B0002Y4SJS,"I'm not the greatest fan of Yu-Gi-Oh! -- or at least not of what I've seen on television. I am, however, a great lover of anime, so when I saw that there was now an uncut version of Yu-Gi-Oh! availible, I knew I needed to give it a chance. Personally, I find that the series thus far is not quite as great as others (Rurouni Kenshin, Escaflowne, ect.), but I expect future episodes will improve as the plot thickens. As far as DVDs go, the audio and subtitles are good, and I enjoy the full Japanese opening and ending themes. If only there were more than three episodes on the disc, I would give a perfect score.",1108425600,4,613,4.247863247863248
8034463,5,B0002Y4SJS,"I love the original version better then the US version, and they didn't edit anything out. The sub are kind of off, I know few Japanese, that's why I know, but it's correct by what they are talking about, and the DVD only contains 3 episodes, But overall I love the DVD. I hope they make more DVD coming Out! ^_^",1098835200,3,312,4.131147540983607
