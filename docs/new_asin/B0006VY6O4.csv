8043708,1,B0006VY6O4,I am not going to slam this guy but he really needs to work on his skill level. I am truly embarrassed to own this.,1360454400,,115,3.64
8043709,1,B0006VY6O4,"If you're looking for a DVD on Miyamoto Musashi's fighting style, Heiho Niten Ichi Ryu as of this posting you shall not find one. In these DVDs, Alexander is selling you something that he created and has no connection with Musashi's style. I'm well aware that if you look around online you'll find other alledged Musashi DVDs, but trust me when I tell you there are none. The closest you'll get to knowing about the Ryu is through Musashi's Book of Five Rings, after that Japan is probably your next best bet, well unless you can find one of the students of the style. Anyways, if you haven't caught drift of what I'm saying by now, I'll make it simple...""DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD."" - Thank you.",1171584000,,695,4.480314960629921
8043710,1,B0006VY6O4,"If you're honestly interested in ""Samurai Swordsmanship"" as the previous reviewer stated, this DVD is not for you. To be honest, you'll actually learn more authentic ""Samurai Swordsmanship"" if you went to YouTube and searched for ""kenjutsu"". I'm starting to feel like a broken record, but as I feel I've stated many times before, George Alexander knows nothing of Miyamoto Musashi's style. The style on this DVD is a style of his own creation. Now, if you'd like you can go spend that $40 on something you won't be cursing yourself about later. =)",1171584000,3,547,4.829787234042553
