8212938,5,6301182022,"Honestly, the only reason I'm giving this movie 5 stars is because my dad has an extra spot in it. He passed away 9 years ago, and it's nice to have even 20 seconds of him on screen to look back on. The film itself isn't a favorite.",1514246400,,232,3.8541666666666665
8212939,2,6301182022,"In today's climate, it's good to see that Washington D.C. has remained pretty much the same! In THE HAPPY HOOKER GOES TO WASHINGTON (1977), the title character, Xaviera Hollander (Joey Heatherton!) is going about her daily work. Oh no! Senate hearings are convened to look into ""sexual excesses in America"". Meanwhile, photographer, Rip Taylor wears his best fiberglass wig, and takes pictures of high-priced call girls. Then, we're off to an orgy! Oh no! That guy's not a john! He's a process server! Ms. Hollander has been called to testify before Congress! Enter lawyer, George Hamilton, who warns Xaviera of the ""new puritanism"" sweeping the country. Much 70's-style, somewhat creaky, politically incorrect humor follows. Ms. Hollander struts onto capital hill, where Darren Stevens' boss, Sen. Larry Tate is meeting w/ Sen. Frank Defazio from LAVERNE AND SHIRLEY and Sen. Uncle Martin from MY FAVORITE MARTIAN for an elevator singalong! Wait, there's the principal from Carrie White's high school, giving testimony! Xaviera finds herself up against several self-righteous, hypocritical, perverts (aka: congress), where she recalls events from her -very silly- past. Cue the naked flashbacks. Check out the strategically-placed items, covering up various naughty bits! Yes, in the 1970's, every man was indeed a slobbering, leering idiot, while every young, giggling woman wanted only to do their bidding! Larry Storch as a tennis pro? Wow! Billy Barty?? Ah-ha! I always knew he had to be a CIA operative! He's too tall for the FBI! Not that this movie has to have an actual point, but just what the hell is going on?! Watching this, is like being slipped a drug that causes sensuality to be insufferably dull! The diner / harem scenes make my skull splinter outward! Do we really have to watch this man eat a pastrami sandwich? Who's the bleached eunuch? FACTS ABOUT THIS FILM: #1- Joey Heatherton is hot enough to power a steam locomotive! #2- The disco decade must have been far less fun than it's purported to have been! #3- The senate hearings in this movie are every bit as mind-mulching as the real ones! What the... ?? Harold ""Odd Job"" Sakata vs. Uncle Martin as Superman? Jack Carter, wearing nothing but boxers and a bib? That's it, I'm outta here...",1512345600,,2264,5.04
8212940,5,6301182022,"This movie is pure camp. I love it! John Waters fans where you at?! Am I right?! There's nothing better than a sex worker that enjoys what she does. It's enough to make a femme daddy proud of being a PRO. Now, there's a comment below that mentions how little conservative politics have changed since this movie was made. So true! With that said, I enjoy immensely a satirical portrayal of how basic and petty the elite white male legislative cult truly is. I don't think I can ever get sick of white men being made fun of honestly...they're so basic tho! So, I hope every pro-hoe gets a chance to appreciate the hilarity of this masterpiece. 5 STARS.",1500336000,,650,4.470588235294118

8212942,4,6301182022,"The Happy Hooker goes to Washington is most everything one would want from a Cannon film: bizarre performances, terrible cringe-worthy dialogue, lots of nudity, and a plot that makes next to no sense.

The film follows the titular Happy Hooker, as she is called before congress to testify about her lascivious acts, as a pretext to...ban sex? The film isn't super clear about what the antagonists are specifically trying to accomplish, and it serves mostly as a framing device for a series of goofy vignettes involving comical displays of T&A.

If you are looking for a film to laugh at with some friends, and perhaps a few adult beverages, The Happy Hooker goes to Washington is the film for you.",1495324800,,697,4.8

8212945,3,6301182022,"outrageously funny moo bee which nonetheless raised the antihetero issues which elected the slave mongering felony religionist Ronny Raygun in 1980, three years after the movie was made under Gimmee Cartier's regime.  From this showing nearly 40 years later, understanding the humor requires knowledge of its timeline context.  It followed by nearly a decade the ""let's pretend this is free love"" poisoning of American society with Marriage You Wanna and Lysergic Acid Dimethylamide.  It preceeded by nearly a decade the neoNazi ""final solution to the hetero problem"" implemented by the homosexist goofermint of Worsingdone District of Corruption.  That subsequent ""solution"" involved terrorizing and shutting down places of worship of hetero religion with object rape con dumbs following from the vote of national homosexual gangs to ""make AIDS everybody's problem"" and the perennial insistence of slave mongering ""religion"" gangs that hetero relations are ""permissible"" only in the divorce racketeering industry which destroys the lives and fortunes of 57% of all males ever snookered into it.  It was created near the beginnings under appointed President Gerry Ford of a brief respite in criminal gang absolute control of human hetero relations going so far in recent years as the prosecution of WikiLeaks messenger Julian Assange for *refusing* to be object raped by Swedish lesbians at the request of the current antihetero
