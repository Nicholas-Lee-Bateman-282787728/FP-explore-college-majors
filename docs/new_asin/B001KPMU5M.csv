3668235,4,B001KPMU5M,"She Creature is very good. I love it. Candy Stripers on the other hand is mediocre at best. I took off a star for that. Still, she creature by itself new on Amazon is $25, this double feature is $7. It could've been she creature/M. Night Shyamalan's the last air bender (which to me is THE worst movie) and I probably still would've bought it.",1423094400,,343,4.292307692307692
3668236,4,B001KPMU5M,"I just got this for She Creature, it's an original and obscure sort of storyline that you don't usually see in movies and it's made rather well. The other one I will not waste my time watching. Uck.",1422662400,,198,4.2368421052631575

The special effects are just so  good that the mermaid looks real. eerie and yet she's beautiful,  this movie was well done.

8315770,3,B001KPMU5M,"This review is for the Deadtime Stories released of 'Candy Stripers' and 'She Creature' released by Sony Pictures Entertainment.

Of the two movies, 'She Creature' is by far the better movie.

'Candy Stripers' is a terrible movie. It doesn't do anything right. It's a horror movie that isn't that scary with a dumb plot. Even if you are watching this for the naked girls, you will be quite disappointed. There isn't a whole lot of nudity in the movie. It really is a horror movie disguised as a girly  movie. Pretty much the whole movie takes place in a hospital and it has a ridiculous plot. Of course, if you are watching this movie then you are probably not expecting an academy award winning plot.

'She Creature' is a movie inspired by the 1950's. This movie has nothing to do with 'She Creature' from the 50's. It uses the name only. It is about a mermaid who is captured by an old English sailor. A carnival sideshow manipulate there way into taking the mermaid with them. Once on board the ship and heading for America, the mermaid escapes and she is much worse than she appears to be. This is a pretty good movie for the budget.

I'm giving this 3 stars. 4 stars for 'She Creature' and 1 1/2 stars for 'Candy Stripers.' At the time of this review, Amazon was selling this standard DVD for $9.99. It's a decent value for the money.",1510272000,,1339,4.448979591836735
8315771,5,B001KPMU5M,Have not watched Candy Stripers however really enjoy She Creature.,1497657600,,66,5.7
8315772,3,B001KPMU5M,"I would have given She Creature 5 stars but the sound quality was horrible. The volume would go down then back up after a couple of minutes, this made enjoying the movie very difficult!! I will be contacting customer service and posting an update later.",1486857600,,253,4.644444444444445
8315773,5,B001KPMU5M,i loved she creature real creepy.candy stripers was not my taste.,1475712000,,65,5.0
8315774,4,B001KPMU5M,Two movies for the price of one. I thought it was a good deal. The she creature was what I was after and was not disappointed.,1439251200,,126,3.8846153846153846
8315775,4,B001KPMU5M,"She Creature was a well made and entertaining film In my opinion.  I did not care much for Candy Stripers, but was the only way I could purchase the other film!",1438300800,,160,4.161290322580645
8315776,3,B001KPMU5M,"they are both good movies, but 'Candy Stripes' has sort of a glitch but its only for a little while, other than that its great!",1423872000,,127,4.12
