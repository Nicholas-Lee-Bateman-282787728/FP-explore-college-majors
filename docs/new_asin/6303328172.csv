627203,2,6303328172,I would have rated it three stars if it would have had all three girls from the Original but since it didn't two stars. The plot drags and while Deanna gives a good performance it was hard to see Helen Parrish as Kay Craig. Kay grew up all right she grew up into an entirely different person! Nan Grey's presence is nostalgic as was Charles Winninger reprising his role but it lacks what Three Smart Girls had-fun! The songs however are very good. An uneven sequel that proves that even during Hollywood's Golden Age sequels have never really worked.,1144800000,,550,4.565656565656566
627204,4,6303328172,"Three Smart Girls Grow Up is a delighful movie about a young girl playing matchmaker to her two sisters. Deanna Durbin has long been one of my favorites and in this film she proves why. She's a natural actress, her voice is beautiful, and the plot of Three Smart Girls Grow Up though slight takes us back to another time. The clothes in the movie are beautiful (in particular an outfit that Nan Grey, playing Deanna's sister, wears early in the movie) and the sets are excellent as well. I'd love to more of Deanna Durbin's films.",1076112000,10,530,4.474226804123711

627446,5,6303328172,"Yet another marvelous release from the library of films made by the charming Deanna Durbin. ""Three Smart Girls Grow Up"" is the popular sequel to Universal Pictures' ""Three Smart Girls,"" the tale of the Craig Sisters and how they manage to reunite their divorced parents. One of the greatest female movie stars ever, at her youthful loveliness.",1372291200,,343,5.035087719298246
627447,5,6303328172,"I became acquainted with the movies of Deanna Durbin just a few months ago but I believe they are all a delight.  With almost all the movies at 90 mins. in length and ending happily, I have heard them described as ""confections,"" and that is probably an accurate analogy.  I would go further by saying they are like a very fine confection, perhaps a Sacher torte.  Miss Durbin's voice has a wonderful tonal quality and her singing technique is highly refined.  She is an excellent actress and it of course never hurts to be beautiful.  The plots to the stories are often trite, however, making the story line so improbable as to be comical in itself.  It is a credit to the actress that she refused to stay in an industry that was so limiting in professional styles.  The reason for watching these movies is strictly to observe raw talent at work. Miss Durbin can take a common everyday song and make it memorable or sing a popular operatic aria with emotion and style that would cause a modern diva to groan with envy.",1364428800,,1018,4.5
627448,5,6303328172,"I would have preferred if they had kept the same actors and actresses from ""Three Smart Girls"" but unfortunately they didn't, nevertheless the movie was very well done and the singing and acting was very good.",1361404800,,209,4.833333333333333
627449,5,6303328172,"I first saw Miss Durbin in a film where she sang in a church and it was set during Christmas.  She had an incredible voice and was an excellent actress, too.",1354924800,,157,4.064516129032258
627450,4,6303328172,"In 1936, Universal Studios took a chance on a young girl singer named Deanna Durbin, first showcasing her in the beloved ""Three Smart Girls"", a movie which reversed the studio's flagging fortunes and established Deanna Durbin as the reigning juvenile box office star.  Playing Penny, the youngest of the Craig sisters, she stole moviegoers hearts with her charming performance and soaring soprano voice.  Three years later, Durbin returned for the first of two sequels - THREE SMART GIRLS GROW UP (1939).

The story opens during Penny's very first society party, where eldest sister Joan (Nan Grey) announces her engagement to long-time beau Richard (William Lundigan).  Everyone greets the news with delight, except middle sister Kay (Helen Parrish) who, Penny later discovers, harbours a strong infatuation for her prospective brother-in-law.  Resolving to find a husband for lovesick Kay, Penny recruits one of her musician friends, Harry (Bob Cummings); but the plan backfires when Joan starts taking an interest instead!

This adorable romantic comedy delivers more ""Three Smart Girls"" magic, complete with most of the original cast (Nan Grey as Joan, Charles Winninger and Nella Walker as the Craig parents).  The only major replacement is Helen Parrish--one of Durbin's close friends of the time--who took over the role of middle sister Kay from original actress Barbara Read.

Musical-wise, the film gets off to a cracking start with Durbin singing ""Invitation to the Dance"" during Penny's first society ball; the other songs include ""La Capinera (The Wren)"", and ""The Last Rose of Summer"".

The Craig family saga would come to a fitting end in 1943 with ""Hers to Hold"".  THREE SMART GIRLS GROW UP is a heartwarming family comedy everyone is sure to love.",1214870400,4,1763,5.241992882562277
627451,5,6303328172,"Once a young Deanna Durbin burst onto movie screens across America in ""Three Smart Girls,"" saving Universal from bankruptcy, there was never any doubt that producer Joe Pasternak and director Henry Koster would bring the wonderful cast back for another go. In some ways, ""Three Smart Girls Grow Up"" is even more enjoyable than the original. The story is still innocent and fun-filled, but a bit less juvenile. And the three girls, Durbin, Nan Grey, and Helen Parrish, while still retaining the innocence of the time in which this film was made, have some fine moments opposite a great cast.

Part of the reason for this film's success is Charles Winninger. He is simply delightful as the father of three young women of assorted ages a bit too caught up providing a lavish lifestyle for them to see all the romantic drama going on right under his nose. At Penny's (Deanna Durbin) coming out party, her oldest sister Joan gets engaged to Richard (William Lundigan). Penny senses something wrong, however, and when she discovers her sister Kay (Helen Parrish) in tears, burning a diary that confesses her love for Richard, she takes Binn's (Ernest Cossart) advice and attempts to play matchmaker.

Tall, dark and handsome in this case turns out to be the flute player from her singing class, Harry (Robert Cummings). Cummings, as usual, especially opposite Deanna Durbin, is fuuny and fabulous. Everything goes wrong, of course, and the more complicated and confusing it gets, the more Durbin and Cummings shine. Harry immediately hits it off with the already engaged Joan, rather than Kay, then everyone believes it's Penny who is in love with him!

Penny can't scheme fast enough to get all the matchmaking right for the sisters she loves, and only on the eve of Joan's wedding to Richard does a busy father finally realize something is terribly wrong and listens to the distraught apple of his eye. But with Harry on his way to Australia and Joan about to walk down the isle with the young man Kay secretly loves, will it be too late?

It's a ton of fun getting there and the viewer is rewarded with an ending that's a sheer delight. Along the way a blooming Deanna Durbin gets to sing ""Because"" and the beautiful ""Last Rose of Summer."" Durbin fans don't want to miss this one!",1174262400,9,2277,4.771573604060913

I live near Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and fairly recently I attended a performance at the historic Carlisle Theater on High Street.  In the lobby is a display case where they commemorated the theater's opening in May of 1939.
