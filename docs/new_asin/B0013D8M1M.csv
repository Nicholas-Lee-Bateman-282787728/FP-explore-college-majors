8250056,5,B0013D8M1M,Perhaps it was me but I have been unsuccessful in watching this movie completely. I found it drawn out and boring.,1241827200,4,114,4.476190476190476
8250057,2,B0013D8M1M,I guess it had a moral/plot. It was just a little predictable and too twisted which made it boring at times. Not worth $17.99 maybe should be priced at about $9.99.,1237420800,4,164,4.32258064516129
