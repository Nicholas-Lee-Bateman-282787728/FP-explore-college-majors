7818533,5,6301928636,"Comedy of Terrors is one of the funniest movies to come out of the 60s. My entire family just fell apart on the couch watching it. You've Vincent Price as the nasty undertaker. You have Peter Lorre as the picked on humble assistant, you've Boris Karloff as the sleepy and near deaf father in law. Oh and add Basil Rathbone as the Shakespeare loving landlord who won't stay dead and you've  an incredible piece of black comedy.",1101340800,3,426,4.532467532467533
7818534,5,6301928636,"This movie is a great.
Vincent Price, Peter Lorre, Boris KArloff, and last but not least, BASIL RATHBONE star in this hilarious black comedy about two aspiring undertakers who are having trouble getting customers, so they kill people just so they can give them a funeral. This movie had me laughin so hard I was crying, especially the part where Basil Rathbone chases Peter Lorre out of his house, quoting lines from Macbeth all the while. And who could forget the utter disgust on Vincent Price's face as he cries in absolute horror ""What did you STEP in?!?""Absolutely hilarious.",1071619200,2,580,4.8686868686868685
7818535,4,6301928636,"This is a great movie if you like to see the classic horror stars letting their hair down.
There's nothing serious in this film but the fun.
Vincent Price and Peter Lorre are the center of attention with Boris Karloff and Basil Rathbone playing the comedy role you never expected to see.
The sets are 1960's B movie stuff, but it just adds to the atmosphere.
If you're looking for something entertaining to watch on movie night this is one to put in the lineup.
I got this and ""The Raven"" at the same time.  Both are funny!",1071100800,,523,4.336734693877551
7818536,5,6301928636,"I LOVE this film!!  Vincent Price is just hysterical as the undertaker who needs to drum up some business, Peter Lorre is great as the assistant, Basil Rathbone is the landlord who wants his year's rent, and Boris Karloff just can't hear a thing.  ""What? Sugar??  There ya go!""  Basil just keeps on coming back to life, quoting from ""Hamlet"" as he goes along, and Peter Lorre laments about his dear Annabel.  Joyce Jamison is Annabel, who is Felix Gillie's love interest.  Annabel is married to Waldo (Vincent Price) and Boris Karloff is her father.  The funeral speech by Karloff is just priceless.  Needless to say, as soon as Rathbone's character is buried we hear: ""What place is this??""  Great.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, YOU HAVE TO!!  And I agree with the comment: ""Where is the DVD??""  Get with it MGM, we still need this one and The Raven, and The Tomb of Ligeia....I have to finish my Vincent Price DVD collection!",1033257600,3,934,4.593939393939394
7818537,5,6301928636,"This is a hilarious movie! I love it. Vincent Price plays an undertaker, as he has taken over his father-in-law's business. Peter Lorre plays his assistant, Boris Karloff plays the hard of hearing father-in-law, & Basil Rathbone wants the rent money. And of course there is Rhubarb (the cat) playing the role of Cleopatra! Oh, & you may want to wear ear plugs during the singing! Yikes! And just when you think everyone is dead, well you thought wrong! You have to see it to know what I'm getting at.",1032739200,,500,4.566666666666666
7818538,4,6301928636,"People forget how good of an actor Vincent Price was. In this film they made for the lone purpouse of poking fun at horror,and it worked. At no point does this movie ever take itself seriously and it works just fantastic. A great laugh.",1016841600,,236,4.386363636363637
7818539,4,6301928636,"C'mon MGM, get on the ball and release this on widescreen DVD!  Having said that, this film has a great cast.  Price, Karloff, Lorre and Rathbone all play off each other extremely well, and Richard Matheson's script is pretty amusing at times.  Another winner from AIP.  I can't wait until MGM finally gets around to releasing the rest of Price's AIP films (especially ""The Raven"") and the rest of the beach films with Annette Funicello.  The DVD's currently available in MGM's Midnight Movie series are a definite improvement over the pan and scan prints that have been available on video over the last several years.  Thanks for that, but keep them coming!",983664000,4,658,4.830357142857143
