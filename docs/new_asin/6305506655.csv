1058522,4,6305506655,"Read Amazon.com's editorial review of this movie for a good overview of its setting.  I can only add that the movie is a look at how good intentions can backfire, in this case that of the European view of progress mixing with African tradition like oil with water.
  The outcome is tragic, yet the principal characters have nothing but fine motives for what they are about.  Culture and other impersonal forces have the final say, and one is left to wonder if progress, or may I say ""progress,"" should be forced on a reluctant people.
  Director Bruce Beresford has been rather unfairly criticized for lop-sided portrayals of virtuous native cultures versus corruptive western civilization, but as with his superb ""Black Robe"" movie ""Mister Johnson"" shows some of the less flattering sides of primitive societies.  Indeed, ""Black Robe"" set off a minor spate of protest for its unblinkingly frank portrayal of Indian tribes in North America several centuries ago.
  Ultimately it's probably safe to say that ""Mister Johnson"" gives a fairly sympathetic showing of the Africans suddenly entangled in the road project headed up by Pierce Brosnan's character, but does so without truckling.  This movie also shows that Brosnan has a broader range than just playing Bond, James Bond.",1085616000,22,1277,5.096153846153846

The acting was superlative by all, but the actor who played Mr. Johnson, Maynard Eziashi, created a complete 3 dimensional character that I will never forget.

7892853,1,6305506655,"Mr. Johnson  is a great movie; it's one of the best movies I ever worked on, a Bruce Beresford classic. Unfortunately this DVD is a basement dub of such shamefully low quality  that it upsets me to watch it. What makes is worse is  that they guys who created this ripoff had the nerve to put their own names on as producers, while the real producers, Michael Fitzgerald and Bill Benenson, never made a penny from it.

These guys need to be prosecuted for piracy, but, in the meantime, don't give them any money.",1335744000,14,511,4.404255319148936
7892854,2,6305506655,"I thought I had lucked out when I spotted this for sale on Amazon.  But upon viewing my new DVD copy of ""Mister Johnson"", I was thoroughly disappointed.  The picture is blurry and it ruins the viewing experience.  Only buy this DVD if you are hard-pressed to see the film, like I was.",1301702400,3,284,4.320754716981132
7892855,5,6305506655,"This film has some of the most authentic depiction of village life in Northern Nigeria I have ever seen. I spent four years in Nigeria (1962-1966} and I have never seen better footage. Many Nigerian intellectuals detested the novel by Joyce Carey upon which this film is based. However the work is an honest account of the clash of cultures and the human tragedy which often transires.
I was disappointed that the jacket description says the film was set in South Africa. South Africa is as different from Nigeria as Portugal is from Finland.",1254268800,9,542,4.776595744680851
