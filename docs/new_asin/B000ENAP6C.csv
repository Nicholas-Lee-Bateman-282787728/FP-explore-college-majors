8111542,4,B000ENAP6C,"The DVD covers the function, disassembly and assembly of the Winchester 1892 in great detail. However the 1886 model is mentioned only in passing. While the 1886 resembles the 1892 in principle, it is much more complicated internally, and requires special techniques for tuning and re-assembly. The accompanying literature purports to offer part diagrams, however a diagram is provided only for the 1886. Thank goodness for YouTube.",1389744000,,432,5.462686567164179
