I felt that way before viewing the film, and still do",1404086400,,132,4.541666666666667

8430294,3,B004I8WN32,"I got this because I'm interested in and approve of Wikileaks, and thought that I should find out more about it.  This DVD was disappointing: it was just a pasted-together collection of about 8 of his lectures, without any commentary....  He comes across as a bit wet behind the ears but well-intentioned.",1330300800,,305,4.846153846153846
8430295,5,B004I8WN32,"The answer to the title of this film, ""Julian Assange: A Modern Day Hero?,"" is still a work in progress. There is no doubt that Assange and his WikiLeaks website have profoundly affected the world, and I think that apparently for the good. But the use of the information provided by the website still hasn't reached its potential. ""Julian Assange: A Modern Day Hero?"" is an incredibly informative and engaging documentary that will give the viewer enough information about Assange and his purpose in life.

The film is divided into eight chapters, each one opening with the line ""courage is contagious."" In part one, Assange gives a brief description of what WikiLeaks is all about: support transparency and produce positive political reform, a message that we will hear, in different ways, during the entirety of the film. The second part begins one month after Bradley Manning, a United States Army soldier (some say intelligence analyst), was sent to prison for passing restricted information to WikiLeaks, and putting Assange on the run for the potential publishing of the leaked documents on his website. There is footage of Assange meeting with representatives of The Guardian, The New York Times, and Der Spiegel, the three newspapers that agreed to publish the documents. It also shows Assange giving conferences and interviews before the material was published and the world knew about it. Part Three deals with the anticipated moment, when 92,000 were released by WikiLeaks and the three chosen newspapers. These documents covered a 6-year period of the war in Afghanistan, and Assange talks about them. Part four, of course, focus on the impact of the release on the press and the world. Inevitable comparisons about this leakage are made with that of the Pentagon papers by Daniel Ellsberg in 1971. On the other hand, in Part five we witness the consequences of the release, and Ellsberg is interviewed. There is also a concise history of Assange and his adventures in hacking in Australia, his life in Iceland, and an analysis in detail about the famous Iraq video, in which we witness civilians being massacred by US soldiers. This video put WikiLeaks and Assange in the radar. Finally, Parts Six, Seven, and Eight feature many interviews of and conferences by Julian Assange, in which every aspect of WikiLeaks and its archive is examined, and where we learn that ""WikiLeaks is an uncensorable website run by the Sunshine Press... which publishes first release documentary leaks or censored materials.""

As I indicated earlier, you may already have an opinion about Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. Before watching this amazing documentary, I supported WikiLeaks and its mission, which is far from finished. After watching ""Julian Assange: A Modern Day Hero?,"" not only has my support of the website increased, but I truly admire Julian Assange. This is one incredibly smart, articulate fellow, who was born to do what he does - so well, I may add. He truly understands the world and the forces that rule it. (2011, color, 180 mins).

8430296,5,B004I8WN32,"The most valuable aspect of this documentary, or rather series of documents, is that it provides a perspective on Assange and Wikileaks that you will most likely NOT be hearing through the mainstream media anytime soon. And that is quite a service. And I suppose that is the whole point of the Wikileaks website. While we are awash in information, data, bytes and whatnot, it's frightening how desperate people are for this canned information we call news. Having worked in news myself to a minor degree, I understand the pressures and temptations. I'm not sure I would  back 100% of what Julian Assange has done. But I would certainly want to live in a world of with Assange than in one without him. For the other side of the story I recommend this.

I'm giving it five stars for what it is doing in allowing Assange to speak for himself. If I was rating purely on film quality I would knock it done to at least four stars. Obviously this hasn't been assembled by big time professionals. The image isn't always crisp. Many sources have been cobbled together. But the value of the material outweighs it's production defects. Besides the 90 minutes of documentary, there are also two entire in context speeches. This is primary source material on an important development in 21st Century communications and events.",1307836800,11,1313,4.779735682819383
