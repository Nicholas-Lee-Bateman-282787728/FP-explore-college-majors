8568306,5,B00BGRZB7S,"The book came with a DVD, and although I haven't watched the DVD yet, I can say the book is great! I bought it because I wanted a marathon-specific strength training plan for my 3rd marathon. I had almost identical times in my first two (3:54:00) and am hoping to PR in my next.  I did speed work to train for my first, but none for my second, so I think the thing that could make the difference now is strength training.  I had done some for both, but not runner-specific, and only once a week.

There are other books that describe running-specific strength training exercises, but this was the only one I saw that offered different plans depending on the race distance. I flipped through the plans for the other race distances, and see that they really do vary.  For example, the shorter distances (5k, 10k) have more emphasis on plyometric exercises, which makes sense.

I had a couple questions, so I e-mailed the author on his website. Jeff Gaudette personally replied within a few hours and gave me access to the strength training material online so I could download a couple extra routines that had been added. Super impressed by that! The book is pretty complete, but the site does have an advanced routine for hips and a new routine for cramping, as well as a routine for hamstrings/glutes that is referenced in the book but was not included in the printed version.

Also, the book came in just 3 days.",1464912000,,1411,4.557312252964427
8568307,1,B00BGRZB7S,"I purchase the strength training program via the Runners Connect webpage.  According to the website ""If you're not happy with your Strength Training for Runners Guide - for any reason or at any time - I will refund your payment 100%. No questions asked, no fine print."" I had several email exchanges with Jeff early on as I implemented the program.  After several weeks, it became clear to me the program was not working and actually making things worse.  Within a few weeks of visiting a physical therapist all my problems seemed to resolve but when I started the program again the pains returned.  I realized it was not a good fit for me but still thought it was a wonderful program.  I contacted Jeff for a refund and received no response.  It has been almost two months and I have attempted to contact Jeff and others at Runners Connect several times.  I am yet to receive a response.  While I once thoughts the pains were just due to a misfit or even me performing the exercises wrong, the poor consumer service and lack of integrity offered by this company has led my to believe that the whole this was a scam to begin with.  Since there was so little information out about this program and runners connect in general I am hoping sharing my story with help others from falling prey to this scam.",1441065600,11,1301,4.502127659574468
8568308,5,B00BGRZB7S,"Like many, I decided to start running without considering the proper weight and strength conditioning and subsequently I suffered a TFL injury that I had to heal.  I bought this program and it's fantastic!  The video shorts are easy to follow.  It really shows where the hidden weaknesses and vulnerable areas are and gives specific instruction for isolating and building strength and flexibility.  I'm looking forward to being able to start my running routine again!  One thing to note is the production quality of the video isn't super high quality (wind noise on the mic and some shots with lighting issues) - but I think it's something self-produced and probably is helping to keep the cost lower.  It doesn't compromise the experience to see the exercises and get the knowledge from the training sessions.  It's totally worth the cost and I'm recommending to all of my friends that run (whether they have experienced injuries or not). You have to buy this!",1410480000,4,961,4.931677018633541
8568309,5,B00BGRZB7S,"This book and DVD are pretty much equivalent to gold for a runner whether it be a new runner or advanced. I recently sustained some running injuries while completing my first half marathon. A big reason was that I didn't have strong enough quads and calves. Not only does this book have the most up to date information about injuries, it lists conservative/aggressive treatments and strength training workouts to build up those muscles that need to need to be  to prevent these. The strength training program is very well thought out and organized. It takes you through the specific muscles you use for running and also works on general body strength. The program is gradual and very efficient. Im pretty sure I haven't been able to find so much accurate information to keep runners healthy, get stronger and in turn run faster. I would easily recommend to any runner I know!",1396137600,4,875,4.7947019867549665
