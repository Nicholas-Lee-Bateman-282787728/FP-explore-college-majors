8725702,5,B0128XM4R8,"Cuba is being spoken about in the Media almost every day and will remain in the spotlight for a long time as the US administration works out the details of a recently renewed diplomatic relationship after 54 years of being political enemies. This documentary is the perfect introduction to Cuba and also a wonderful testimony of the intellectual and personal growth that results from a Study Abroad experience. Through the eyes and the lens of six American students in a photojournalism class, the viewer can live, learn, and transform in Havana. The use of a meta-cinematic technique provides the perfect aesthetics entryway for this project while the off-screen narration builds a solid contextual framework that guides and gives meaning to what is being seen and experienced.  Esther and Bill Gentiles work present the students of Latin America and Cuba with a range of pedagogical possibilities.",1440374400,,899,5.2
8725703,5,B0128XM4R8,"Through their eyes is a compelling character driven documentary about self-exploration, cultural immersion and challenge of beliefs, set in what used to be forbidden for most Americans, the mesmerizing country of Cuba. Through the lens of director and Professor Bill Gentile, we witness the journey of six American University students as they partake on an exciting four-month semester program in 2011 that will prove to be a life changing experience.
Both in the classroom and in the field, this very diverse group of individuals become exposed to the knowledge of historians, professors and photographers in Havana and around the country- that bring them to challenge their own preconceptions. Politics, revolution, society and family structures, race and religion, are fully decoded only to be left with an understanding -as Chelsea Crandall, one of the students in the documentary puts it herself- that everything is layered and complex and it must be approached from that perspective. Theres something simply magical about witnessing this cultural and learning process, not only between the students and their Cuban counterparts but within themselves.
The cameras, as main tool of their backpack video journalism class, become the medium or instrument that allows them to not only capture but really connect with the humanity of their suspects and find common ground. From tattoo artists, hip hop movements, personal initiatives and sustainable development; Chelsea, Efrain, Paul, Cristina, Dara and Emmalee, brings us with them into an adventure through the streets of old Havana, the history of the Bay of Pigs, beautiful sunsets, beaches and streams.
In a time when the Obama administration has announced the historic reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, Through their Eyes becomes an informative and important guide into the challenging of political preconceptions in a time of dialogue, progress and change.",1439424000,,1956,5.523333333333333
8725704,5,B0128XM4R8,"Given the current crossroads in US/Cuban relations-this documentary sharing personal experiences of US students coming in contact with Cuba for the first time is more pertinent than ever. In an hour-long documentary filmmakers Bill and Esther Gentile accompany the journey of six American University students as they explore Cuba in a unique study-abroad experience dedicated to photojournalism. By the end of the semester each of the students produce their own photo essay on Cuba from underground rappers to the solidarity among Cubans in an exceptionally resilient neighborhood. Throughout the film the students grapple with the complex realities of Cuba in terms of race, religion, the US Embargo, official histories and prejudices while also working to capture it all through the lens of a camera. I loved it and will use it in the classroom!",1438560000,,847,5.3283582089552235
