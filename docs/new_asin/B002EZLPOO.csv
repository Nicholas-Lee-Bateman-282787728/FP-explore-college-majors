3920676,4,B002EZLPOO,My heart broke to see what immigrants go through trying to come to America for a better life. This was an eye opener and a must see for those who don't know what others go through trying to find a better life.,1290124800,3,209,4.0
3920677,5,B002EZLPOO,"This Story couldn't be more realisticly made, about what happens when someone tries to cross the boarder illegaly to have a better life and who want to help their family members back home by risking their own lives. A MUST SEE!",1288310400,,227,4.560975609756097

thank you",1284768000,,133,3.925925925925926
3920679,4,B002EZLPOO,"I think it a great film but it could have been done a little differently... I am sure there is more pain and suffering involved with crossing the border but the story revolved around the ""coyotes"" and the ending was a happy one",1283817600,,227,4.3023255813953485
3920680,3,B002EZLPOO,"First off I just want to say This was not a bad movie. I liked the very graphic realism and scenery of the film, I liked the way it was shot and how you can really feel these people's pain agony and thirst. You see many people die even some of those you think were going to survive die but that goes along with the reality of the film although it almost feels like the message is: people always die in the desert so keep your ass in Mexico.

Apart from that I expected this movie to be sad and in its best moments it really is a touching story, but my main problems were with the storytelling; the acting was not all that great and something that really bothered me was the movie's main character/villain. Some actors can really make you cheer for a character you would normally hate but poor Parra was just given a bad role, in one scene he stabs a guy for standing up to him then rapes a woman for asking for water and in the next he's a sweet guy who cares about Evangelina's character and her kids and just wants to do one last trip so he can get away from this life. Oh I get it, he's not a perverted rapist or degenerate psycopath he's just misunderstood you know, he's an orphan or something. Bulls#!t.

Then we have the little girl who spends most of the film drawing on rocks, now i understand she's just a child but there's children out there who can act like they're sad when all these people around them die. I really don't want to ruin the rest of the movie for anyone so im just going to stop, like i said its not a bad movie i just could not sympathize for the murdering rapist as badly as Pedro Ultrearas wanted me to.",1278806400,3,1634,4.135220125786163
3920681,3,B002EZLPOO,"I bought this DVD based on the good reviews here and also for the lead actor, Gustavo Sanchez Parra, who has been a mainstay of the New Mexican Cinema movement for the last decade.  While 7 Soles was interesting and definitely had some bright spots, overall it's a far cry short of the many great Mexican films of the 2000s.  In fact, it feels more like a well-produced television movie.

First the positives: Sanchez Parra gives a good performance, in this his first leading actor credit that I have seen.  Some of the camerawork is also excellent: for example there is a still scene of a truck driving past a border fence, which is a marvelous exercise in artistic simplicity (it feels just like Gabriel Figueroa in color).  There are several shots like that.  Also, the off-angle aerial shots of Chicago do a great job of capturing the awe of life in a bustling American metropolis, especially when contrasted with the slow-moving pace of life in the Mexican village.  The effect is to dizzy you at the wonder, much as a rural immigrant might see it upon their own arrival.  Finally, the details of the Mexican village are spot-on accurate, down to the tablecloth in the kitchen and the mesquite tree in the yard.  The process of migration with the coyotes is in many cases also very accurately portrayed.

While the negatives never really ruined my enjoyment of the film, they almost immediately disqualify 7 Soles from consideration as a serious piece of filmmaking.  First of all are the performances: many of the actors here don't shine past daytime soap opera quality.  The father in Chicago (what a fake country accent), the father-in-law in Mexico (pretend to grieve), and even Evangelina Sosa in her village (she looks noticeably out of place there), all really sunk my opinion of the film in the first 10 minutes.  And the film production has scarce any of the color distortion, movement, or special handling which so exemplified the Novo Mexican Cinema movement.  It looks like it was filmed with videotape, evoking a sitcom-like quality more characteristic of the lowbrow Mexican cinema movement.  And the film's realism, however accurate in many regards, is sunk by a heavy-handed moral message.  In that sense it is all too reminiscent of the epoca dorada Mexican film Espaldas Mojadas (1953), which I think may have actually been funded by the US Border Patrol as a blatant act of propaganda.

Those points aside, I still enjoyed 7 Soles and don't regret buying it.  I will pass it around for my Mexican friends to watch and they will probably think higher of it than I did.  But for me, sadder than its story is the fact that 7 Soles stands as a testament to the end of Mexico's decade as the premier foreign language film-producing nation.  In fact, there were very few Mexican films worth mentioning after 2006.  While a drop-off in line with the 1960s-80s is unlikely, Mexican filmmaking may now be on a course for years of mediocrity and anonymity, with only occasional bursts of excellence or interest.

The DVD is in a fairly-letterboxed format with English-only subtitles, which accurately portray the Spanish dialogue.",1273536000,25,3144,4.837383177570094
3920682,5,B002EZLPOO,"This movie is very well written and acted and gives a vivid image of what many people go through trying to cross the border in order to seek a better life for themselves and their children.  All crossings are difficult and dangerous, some more than others. And unfortunately, a lot of people die.  Is it really worth it?  Evidently a lot of people think it's worth the risk.  Very touching movie.  I had to just sit and think for a while after it was over.",1260230400,8,456,4.317647058823529

8368591,3,B002EZLPOO,"Illegal immigration across Arizona is very real.  I watched this movie because of the location in my state.  The Devil's Highway west of Nogales, basically a dry wash, is a notorious smuggling route and not everyone makes it.  This movie is based on a compilation of many real events along this route, much like Luis Urrea's book by the same name.  (That book is still Urrea's best work.)

This story is ultimately a tragic, sad story. The migrants face violence from each other, the smugglers, the US Border Patrol and Americans. But what takes away from the message is the amateurish acting.  I have seen better movies concerning this very real human tragedy.",1514073600,,661,4.8053097345132745
