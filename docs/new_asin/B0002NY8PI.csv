2107505,5,B0002NY8PI,"What a wonderful surprise to discover that one of the best series ever to grace television is finally being released, complete, and (hopefully) season by season.  I have no doubt that these sets will become collector's items, treasured possessions among people like me who saw the show when it originally aired back in the early '60's. There was a simplicity and unique quality that endeared the town of Mayberry, with all its special inhabitants, to any person desiring to return to a place where life was just a little slower and easier.  Like everyone else, I truly hope these discs will be complete shows and not the abbreviated versions so often shown over the years on television.  For the true fan (and there must be mulitple thousands of us), nothing else will suffice.  Whatever, I sincerely thank Paramount for releasing this series. You've made a lot of people very happy!",1093478400,8,883,4.866666666666666
2107506,5,B0002NY8PI,"I rarely pre order any dvds but this I could not resist.  Finally they are putting THE show out in a complete season..I am tired of searching the cut out bins for the few espisodes of ""TAGS"" on dvd, and they really aren't worth having but to a starving man its a buffett.  I can say this is one show that should have been out sooner but its better late than never.",1093392000,6,364,4.041666666666667
2107507,5,B0002NY8PI,"I've been waiting a long time for this show to finally be released, and I can't wait to get it -- I've already pre-ordered.  I'm confident the quality of this collection will be high since it's an official release from Paramount, who owns the rights to the series, and not just a no-name repackaging of public-domain episodes.  Also, according to [...] the running time is 15 hours and 15 minutes.  If they're right, and since there are 32 episodes, that works out to a little over 28 minutes and 30 seconds per episode, so it sounds like they will indeed be complete and uncut!  Time will tell.  Speaking of time, tagsdvdreview.iwarp.com reports that the release date has been delayed until November 12th.  Don't know where he got that info, and I hope he's wrong, but thought I'd post it just in case.  Even if it is delayed, it's well worth the wait!",1093219200,9,853,4.572368421052632
2107508,5,B0002NY8PI,"A previous reviewer raised some very good and pertinent questions about the content of this DVD package, such as will the episodes be complete/unedited, will they include the original music, will the DVD's contain any extras, etc.

  To be sure, these are valid concerns, the most important of which is the question of whether the episodes are truly Complete (if so, each should run about 25 and  minutes, so check the times when you play the DVD to find out whether or not you've been ripped off).  However, in order to be Truly Complete, they should also include the original CAST COMMERCIALS that were produced and included in each episode.

  Each episode of the Andy Griffith show (particularly in the first season) included a one minute commercial for the shows sponsor (Sanka coffee, Post cereals, etc) in which members of the regular cast (Andy, Barney, etc), as well as non recurring guest cast members, worked a plug for the sponsors product into the STORYLINE of that weeks episode.  These are very creative and funny, and are very much a part of each episode (ordinarily I loathe, despise, and cannot stand commercials; however, these are of a different stripe altogether).  I have been fortunate enough to view a few of these, and they are truly delightful, like discovering a whole other part of the show you never knew existed (cast commercials for later seasons of the show morphed into more generic scenario's which were not necessarily episode specific; while perhaps not as uniquely creative as the earlier ones woven into each weeks storyline, they are nonetheless valuable and enjoyable to watch).  This practice (of including cast commercials in a weekly series) was also done in some other shows as well (Dennis The Menace, Gomer Pyle, Mister Ed, Beverly Hillbillies, The Flintstones, etc).

  For myself, I already expect the DVD producer to include the Complete episodes, with original music and credits, in a Non-colorized, technically remastered/restored version with clean audio and video quality (anything less and they can forget about getting my money).  This much they automatically owe to us already, since we are paying their bills and lining their pockets.  To give value for value is the least they must do if they want to be known as honorable businessmen.

  But if they really want to prove themselves loyal to their customers (we who give them our hard earned money), and show themselves to be respectable American entrepreneurs worthy of our continued support and respect at the same time, then do the right thing and give us the Cast Commercials!!  I for one would gladly pay generously for the inclusion of these gems into the DVD package (something that could genuinely be called an ""Extra""), and I'm sure all true Andy Griffith fans would as well.  C'mon, Paramount, give us the Cast Commercials!!",1093132800,18,2842,4.978813559322034
2107509,5,B0002NY8PI,"Can't wait to get this.  Thanks, Mart, for cluing me in on this.  Now I just need to go out and buy a DVD player, but it will be well worth it.  The best television show EVER!",1092960000,4,175,3.675675675675676
2107510,5,B0002NY8PI,I just want to  say that it is about time. I am already pre-ordering my box set now. If Paramount wants to continue to make a profit they will quickly start releasing the next seasons back to back. I know they will get my money for them. I am tired of watching those crappy best of dvds that aren't even in the original format. Thank you paramount,1092787200,10,347,4.17910447761194
2107511,5,B0002NY8PI,"It is about time! That's all I can say about a show that changed the way american televison was viewed. PARAMONT finally got the message. If you look on the net right now there are 20 to 50 different Andy Griffith fan clubs just looking for itmes like these! I, among hundereds of thousands fans need these shows since they are so few and far between on todays televison programming. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!

P.S.- Bring out the next four seasons of black and white episodes really soon!!!!",1092182400,14,485,4.6395348837209305
2107512,5,B0002NY8PI,"Out of all of the seasons of the Andy Griffith Show, I feel for one that the first season was the best! This dvd set is a great buy including that it was a 32 episode season. What I don't understand is how they can sell Happy Days that has 16 episodes for the same price! Well, anyway no matter what show Paramount puts on the market is a great price and a great selection for any classic tv fans. Andy Griffith Show is a true classic amongst itself!",1091750400,12,450,4.067415730337078
2107513,5,B0002NY8PI,"After the hodgepod of Andy Griffith releases over the years, some good, some not so good (such as those without the original theme), it's about time they started releasing Andy Griffith season by season, with the first season released Oct 12 (which may have been delayed to November 16). If done well, this should be a hit. Thanks Paramount.",1090540800,10,341,4.796610169491525

2107519,5,B0002NY8PI,This is a true classic of the 60's when times were simpler and folks are more laid back just like in Mayberry. This is one of those shows you would probably enjoy when there is not much going on but to stay home and chill out for a lazy afternoon or late night tv time and or rainy days. Just jump in the couch and get some popcorn and soda and this is the flick that you can pig out!,1515801600,,384,3.8125

2107524,5,B0002NY8PI,This show is often rated as one of the best shows ever made. I agree and think it's still #1. The cast is perfect together and the show is still funny today.

Good characters, good comedy, good people.  And it's particularly fun to see those episodes I missed.",1505779200,,366,4.185714285714286
2107528,5,B0002NY8PI,"The Andy Griffith Show is unique in a sense that it started out fun and has all the standard encounters and stories that most TV programs had but it has never deteriorated or got so left field, as to lose its appeal. Every show is entertaining and usually carries a message.

A lot of other programs spun off from the characters that played in this series. And you always think that Opie Taylor (Ronny Howard) is always young. Everyone knows that they issued Deputy Barney fife ""1960-1965"" (Don Knotts) one bullet that has seen a lot of action in his pocket. Too many people to name here.

This series will bring back old memories or can also create some new ones.",1504483200,,664,4.479338842975206

The show mostly contained gentle life lessons, but had a surprising amount of character conflict. Most of the issues were solved by the gentle country wisdom of Sheriff Taylor, but he had his own issues at time. No one on the show was ""too perfect"".

Show range from amusing, to laugh out loud funny, to tear jerkers. It had it all.

Wonderful writing, fun characters, and a positive message with every episode.  Andy, as Sheriff Taylor, manages to resolve conflicts with the wisdom of Solomon sometimes, though I'm sure he would claim it's just ""common sense.""  It's so nice to be able to relax and enjoy good storytelling, without worrying about anything nasty jumping in to spoil it.  Whew!  So glad this is available.

Good for stress relief and a change of pace from the cynical tone and cheap laughs from overtly sexual comedy. Just watch this and enjoy a simpler time. I'm not old enough to remember this in first run, but everyone remembers the reruns over the decades that followed. It's nice to be able to watch from the beginning of the series and see how Andy toned down the heavy dose of country bumpkin. Still very funny first season, but the series gets better later.",1482019200,,572,4.355140186915888

After this season was over, Andy realized it should be the other way, and the show improved dramatically - or should I say comedically!  Features Eleanor Donahue as Andy's love-interest, Eleanor Walker.

2108017,5,B0002NY8PI,Good,1479600000,,4,4.0
2108018,5,B0002NY8PI,"As one who grew up watching Andy Griffith, I thoroughly enjoy watching the first five season again ... and again.  It just never seems to get old.  I never really cared for the series after Don Knotts.  The magic in the show seemed to be a chemistry between Andy Griffith and Don Knotts that is quite rare.  Watching these episodes brings much laughter - it is no wonder that Don Knotts won several Emmys during his time on the series.  But the episodes also bring several tender moments.

There are many life lessons taught through these episodes, including the ever present theme of ""believe in others.""  In a world of TV today that seeks to tear down, destroy, ridicule and rule over others, a show where the main character spends time defending and protecting his bumbling sidekick, sometimes laying his own reputation on the line, is amazing.  And when Andy saved Barney's bacon and solved the problem, Andy would almost always give the credit publicly to Barney.  Not sure you'd see that in too many sitcoms today.  You can watch this show and feel good when its done.

The lessons for raising children should not go unnoticed. In one episode Andy gets upset with Opie who gets very mad at others because Opie did not win a race and is a ""sore loser.""  Andy teaches Opie that it's not about losing, but how you react that is more important.  Contrast that to what we teach kids today - everyone is a winner, everyone gets a trophy - there are no winners.  In today's world of finding someone else to take the blame or helping others find a way not to take responsibility, this series stands in stark contrast.  It teaches us to own our mistakes and failings while understanding it's not the end of the world and moving forward with the support of others.

It's amazing how much my young grand daughter enjoys watching Andy Griffith.  She enjoys the sophisticated kids shows of today, but she will ask if she can watch Andy Griffith, and then sit entranced by the show.

As great as it was to watch these shows over and over, they became more enjoyable after reading more about the special bond of friendship between Andy Griffith and Don Knotts!

The quality of these DVDs is great, especially considering the technology that was used to originally record them.",1479600000,,2267,4.6225

The simple down home life of Mayberry with Sheriff Andy Tailor, his son Opie, Aunt Bee and Deputy Barney Fife is silly, feel good TV. These are well written shows that all members of the family can watch; no in your face sex, foul language or social/political  agenda being pushed. Makes me wish I could live there. (I would miss my smartphone and internet) Barney only carries one bullet for his gun and keeps it in his shirt pocket...Violence is not an issue. The town drunk puts himself in jail...way more integrity than any of our politicians. Within the time of an episode, life's trials are worked out and everything is good again.

On a serious note, I think Andy Griffith should be required watching for all police officers as a learning tool on empathy and low-key-ness.",1470787200,,388,4.923076923076923

2108448,5,B0002NY8PI,"The Andy Griffith Show (TAGS) is an absolute classic that is just as enjoyable today as it was in the 1960s.  The first five seasons in black and white are the best of the series with excellent writing and out loud laughs.  Those five seasons focus primarily on the relationships between Andy and his son, Opie, and Andy with his deputy, Barney Fife.  Aunt Bee, Floyd the barber, Otis the drunk, Mayor Pike, Mayor Stoner, Thelma Lou, Ellen Crump, Gomer Pyle, Earnest T. Bass, the Darlings, Clara Edwards fill out an exceptional cast of characters.  The storytelling of those first five years centers on Andys sheriff duties with Barney and Andys simple home life with Opie and Aunt Bee.  Music is also a central theme in many episodes taking advantage of Griffiths musical talents.  In the first season, Griffith realized Knotts was the comic star and settled in to play the courageous, selfless, hero of the show to offset Barneys troublemaking.  There are also some very heartfelt and emotional father/son episodes that will melt the hardest hearts.

Once Don Knotts, aka Barney Fife, left (except for five fun guest starring episodes) for a movie contract after season five, the series changed directions and the focused more on the town of Mayberry and its citizens.  These are easily distinguishable because they are the start of the colored episodes.  While they tried to introduce a Barney replacement, Deputy Warren Ferguson, for eleven episodes in Season 6, the character didn't take and the show shifted toward Andys relationship with Goober Pyle, Howard Sprague, Floyd Lawson, and eventually Emmett Clark, who replaced Floyds position on the show.  The colored episodes are actually more Mayberry RFD than TAGS.  While it was still fun to be in Mayberry, the last three seasons just are not as good as the first five.",1470700800,2,1828,4.9573770491803275

2108639,4,B0002NY8PI,"The Andy Griffith Show is definitely one of the greatest TV shows of all time because it didn't waste its time with jokes but rather on creating interesting characters, and this season shows both of what well and didn't as it developed. One, you have Opie at the right impressionable age for being a precocious kid, and he's perfect as he delivers lines perfectly and barely struggles to tell the truth. Aunt Bee was more of a secondary character this season as it focused more on Don Knotts, but the best thing about it is the season to star Elinor Donahue as Ellie Walker, possibly the most liked female character in the series. Smart and beautiful, she was the best character to support Andy even as she collides with him on issues. She should never have left the series because it was a huge mistake for the embarrassingly difficult to watch string of lady friends to come later. The worst part of this season is has too many episodes with Andy as the dumb rube, a far cry from the clever and rational figure he becomes later on. Watching this season definitely gives you an idea of everything the writers attempted, what worked and what didn't. Still, I like the idea that worked, Ellie and Opie, and react judgmentally the stuff that didn't, making Andy look foolish and I move on from there.",1467331200,3,1298,4.575107296137339

Watching that old black and white, (let's be honest, there never was true black, nor white, on a CRT television), in the olden days, never looked this good.

I know it has to be pretty expensive to restore the old TV shows, but this was certainly a good choice.  Shows that had long runs, such as Gunsmoke, Little House On The  Prairie and others may also be worth the expense.  I hope so.

2109637,4,B0002NY8PI,"I had never seen this classic sitcom--the first of the ""rural"" subgenre--when it was actually on TV, and had my doubts about it at first.  But it grows on you, perhaps because, despite its occasional slapsticky feel, it's most often a warm, gentle, truly down-home series that just happens to take place in a community (Mayberry, NC) inhabited by a large cast of very individual people.  Andy Taylor (Griffith) has served as sheriff and justice of the peace for five years while trying to bring up his motherless six-year-old son Opie (Ronny Howard)--the two love nothing better than to take the afternoon off and go fishing together--and keep his dithery cousin and deputy, Barney Fife (Don Knotts), out of trouble.  (Barney's so incompetent that he's issued only one bullet at a time for his service handgun--and keeps it in the breast pocket of his shirt; but he's also very much a by-the-book type, and several of the conflicts in the series arise from this, since Andy, whom he admires, is much more laid back and easygoing.)  Andy's Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) provides a mother-figure for father, son, and cousin alike, lady druggist Ellie (Elinor Donahue of ""Father Knows Best"" fame) appears as Andy's underplayed romantic interest, and such local folks as barber Floyd Lawson (Howard McNear), town drunk and frequent resident of Andy's two-cell jail Otis Campbell (Hal Smith), Barney's girlfriend Thelma Lou (Betty Lynn), and pompous Mayor Pike (Dick Elliott) provide foils for both lawmen.  Yet Andy also has a lot of down-home wisdom and insight into human character, and he's not without his share of cleverness, as we see in one episode in which he helps the State Police to capture an escaped convict without a drop of blood being spilled.  Apart from this, there is, as many people have observed, almost no crime at all in Mayberry, except for Otis's regular toots, and that gives Andy plenty of time to hang out at Miss Ellie's drugstore, play with his country band (he's not bad on the guitar), go fishing with Opie, and impart assorted wise saws to the people around him.  Occasionally I found the humor a little overdone--watching it made me squirm--but that's true of most sitcoms.",1451692800,,2199,4.9110512129380055

2109656,5,B0002NY8PI,"If people think Seinfeld was the first show about nothing, they are mistaken. Back in the days when you couldn't even show a toilet on TV, the plots were pretty simple. No show was probably better at taking a plot about Barney throwing away Aunt Bee's new linen napkins and making it into 24 minutes of entertainment. And that's about how simple the plots were. The plots were contrived and often corny, but this is a show that holds up for people who grew up with it. Not sure how it plays with 7-year-olds today, but this was some fairly clever work. Also, knowing now that Francis Bavier is said to have been a malcontent makes it fun to watch the interplay between her and Griffith, to whom it is said she apologized in retirement for being such a lousy co-worker.",1449014400,,768,4.453900709219858

I enjoy looking at the items of the past and of a time when people worked hard to get what they wanted, had more compassion towards others-giving when they could and not Expecting something in return. A time when our Elders were respected, and kept at home as they aged to be taken care of by the next generation (not put into a home somewhere alone and forgotten). Yep, Great TV for sure.

My parents tell me that people actually dressed  that way (women with dresses, jewelry, and hair nicely styled; men with shirts and khaki type pants) in the 1950's and 60's.  Society as a whole was more civil and well-mannered.  Vulgar language was not used in public and never in the presence of women or children.  Nowadays it's difficult to find a  program that doesn't have swearing or sex scenes or violence throughout.  I've resorted to looking at TV Land and Disney not just for my children, but for me.

2110185,5,B0002NY8PI,"The Andy Griffith Show is a time capsule of a simpler, more innocent period of our nation's history. Ron Howard, Andy, and all the other cast members are people I grew up with. Part of the enjoyment of the show is to see if you can remember some of the actor's names because there are so many that were successful on a different venue. Also, the dialogue is clever, the repartee exquisite. I never get tired of watching Barney Fife struggling to get his one bullet out and injecting it in his gun and then shooting himself in the foot or Andy calming him down when he gets overwrought. And dear, sweet Opie, the cutest kid since Shirley Temple, he was a childhood genius. The Andy Griffith Show is a timeless masterpiece of television comedy. Adults today can sit their children down to watch the show confident that there is nothing the kids shouldn't hear or see.",1440633600,,865,4.515923566878981

We often hear concerns voiced amongst all generations, about the degradation of our society and the plummeting of family values. Just take a quick look at the subject matter and content offered on today's network television lineup and compare the story-lines to what was used in the Andy Griffith show.

2110289,5,B0002NY8PI,"Always a classic! For me, one of the top ten TV shows of all time (not just comedy). The way they integrated down home spun humor, comedic insights into ordinary lives of small town and country folks of a bygone era, with solid lessons in morality, priorities and child rearing (for the child, the parent, and outside influences) it spoke of things that most, if any other shows then didn't and none do today; but values we need back so bad!
It is a pure escape from what our world has become.
The Don Knots seasons  (1-5) are the penultimate episodes. The show suffered a great loss when he left (much the same way MASH did when Larry Linville left) which reflected the crucial changes in America at that time. There was never again that ribald, physical humor that his character shined a light (with such animated hyperbole and comedic genius) on the tiny, irrational, hidden parts of the human psyche!
It is both nostalgic and refreshing to watch.",1439078400,,950,4.621301775147929

2110489,5,B0002NY8PI,"Let me start with a little bragging:  I scored this for $39.96, shipping included.  Now, on to the review, which I will try to keep short yet informative.

Picture quality is just what you'd expect from a good HD transfer: grainy and awesome.  Clarity and detail are more present than ever before, which is most noticeable in clothing, badges, nature scenes, and... well, just about anything with detail to be seen.  It really is a thrill to see a show this old looking this nice.

Besides pristine HD transfers, there's something else this blu-ray offers that the previous DVD release lacked entirely:  special features.  Included are the original sponsor spots as well as the original end credits scene (with Andy and Opie walking away from the lake).  Having been born in 1985, I had never seen those before, so that was pretty neat.  Also included is the 1986 TV movie, Return To Mayberry, and an episode of The Danny Thomas Show titled ""Danny Meets Andy Griffith"" (both also remastered in 1080p).  Finally, there are some home movies taken on the set of the show (in color, surprisingly), and an interview with Andy Griffith and his wife on CBS' Person To Person nicely caps off the special features.

That concludes my review.  I already owned this season on DVD, but as soon as I saw a good deal, I upgraded to the blu-rays and gave the DVDs to my Mom.  I'm very glad I did.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go watch this while I wait for CBS to announce a Gilligan's Island blu-ray release.  (Wouldn't that show look amazing in HD?  I think so.)

NOTE TO CBS:  I wanted this and would have bought it MONTHS ago, but had to wait 'til I found a better deal on a used copy as your original price of over $70 was just too ridiculous.  $45-50 would still have been expensive, but much more reasonable.  I want and am patiently waiting for season 2, but if it's not more reasonably priced than season 1 was, I will pass on it, too, until somebody sells one used for under $40.",1420329600,7,1985,4.4735376044568245

One of the Classic shows in Television history along with Dick Van Dyke and others. I like the black and white episodes personally. I probably will only get the first 3 seasond but I am still deciding.  Elinor Donahue plays Ellie who is Andys girl. I read recently where she left the show after the first season. It would have been a much better show if she had stayed.  If you like Andy Griffith I would recommend at least the first 3 seasons.,1412899200,,557,4.186915887850467

I would definitely recommend you buy it now while it is so cheap. It was close to $25 when I purchased it. It also includes the Christmas episode (the only Christmas episode from The Andy Griffith Show). I got to meet Miss Margaret Kerry, who plays Helen Scobie, in that episode and she said she really enjoyed it. Also later into this season you'll see the addition of Betty Lynn to the cast. I've met Miss Lynn several times and she is a nice woman. I really enjoy her performances as Thelma Lou on The Andy Griffith Show.",1410220800,,681,4.3700787401574805

2.) IF you can get this for less that $60, buy it.
3.) Why? Filmed on 35mm film, the ""reunion movie""
AND the individual episodes have NEVER looked better!
4.) Just a few examples:
a. =>) In the ""pilot"" there are no windows, heck, no GLASS in the two cars.
b. =>) Danny Thomas's scar is quite obvious.
c. =>) In the color movie, you can clearly see a scab with make up inside Andy's ear.
d. =>) In one episode a long scar is visible on a tomboy-ish woman's face.

2110523,5,B0002NY8PI,I am an avid fan of Andy Griffith. I've been watching it since a child. But not it has been taken off Amazon Prime. I am very disappointed!!! In my opinion it was one of the better choices of television shows to watch. There isn't much to offer tv wise with the Amazon Prime. Now that it's been taken off I'm considering to discontinue it. I haven't decided yet.,1408320000,2,362,4.260869565217392

2110525,5,B0002NY8PI,"Not bad enough that Prime has the world's lamest video collection.  No, they wait until you sift through all the junk and finally manage to find something worth watching and THEN they pull a bait-and-switch on you.  Can't you imagine the moment of inspiration at Amazon?  ""I know!  Lots of Prime members are watching the Andy Griffith Show - we'll get them hooked, then pull it off Prime and make them pay $1.99 an episode for their Mayberry fix!  BWAAAA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!!!""

Well, this addict isn't going for it.  I just ordered the next AGS disc from Netflix.  If the series goes onto ""long wait"" there, I can borrow the DVD's from the library.  Worst comes to worst, I'll buy the whole eight year series on Ebay for around $75, shipping included.  There were 249 episodes, so that comes to thirty cents each.  Trust me when I say that I would do that in a Big Apple minute before I'd pay a single extortionate $1.99 to watch a no-longer-free episode on Prime.

Another reviewer said the withdrawal of this show has put him two steps closer to not renewing his Prime membership, and I'm certainly in agreement there.  This has made me think - do I need Prime in the first place, especially now that it's a dollar short of a hundred for membership each and every year?  That's $500 in five years - more, because they'll undoubtedly increase the fee again.

As far as the streaming video goes, I end up watching things on Prime that I don't enjoy that much and wouldn't watch, except for the fact that they're ""free"".  I could go up a few dollars on my Netflix subscription instead, and watch things I actually want to see.

The famous Prime two-day delivery is almost never just two days, either; if you order things on the weekend, it adds a day or two - and anyway, how often is it that important to get something that fast?  In a way, it's better to have time to anticipate the arrival of something new.  Also, I spend more with Prime.  Before I had it, I'd wait until I had $25 worth of things to order so I could get free shipping, and by then, often I'd have changed my mind about buying them.  That factor, plus the $99 membership, much more than offsets the few times that I did end up paying shipping.

While Amazon has the right to pull video off Prime whenever it wants to, I do think it's manipulative for them to do so with TV series.  For those, unlimited streaming should BE unlimited.",1408233600,3,2398,4.437070938215103
2110526,5,B0002NY8PI,Very disappointed that this show is no longer on prime. We were in the middle of season 2 and started to watch the next episode when we noticed it is now $1.99 per episode! We really enjoy the show but will no longer be watching it.,1408233600,3,232,4.065217391304348

For some reason these credits were lost to blank gray background end credits in syndication, and the previous DVD!
Now this Blu-ray restores these original end credits, along with the original episode specific ""Cast Commercial"" at the end of the episode.
The commercial ties in to the storyline of that episode.

Also included are bonus materials:
The original Pilot show that aired in the DANNY THOMAS SHOW
HOME MOVIES with the Howards on the set (basically a silent behind-the-scenes of the filming of the opening titles & some episodes).
PERSON TO PERSON interview with Andy Griffith
The 1980's re-union special ""RETURN TO MAYBERRY"".

As far as the HD Blu-ray picture quality, it is very good but not enough of an improvement over the previous very good DVD release to re-invest just for the HD image.  BUT it is worth it to me to buy this (and I did for $49.99 at Target) to see the original end commercial & end credits as well as all of the bonus material.  Remember that the original DVD release had no bonuses!

The inclusion of the reunion special makes me worry that CBS Home Video is not confident that the other seasons will be released.  And at the horribly high list price that CBS Home Video is asking, I would not be surprised it doesn't sell well.  Right now the best price is at Target for $49.99.

2110630,5,B0002NY8PI,"I've had a chance to screen the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andy-Griffith-Show-Complete-First-Season-Blu-ray/dp/B00H5NY6E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andy Griffith Show: Complete First Season [Blu-ray</a>], and I'm impressed.  The quality of the images, as anticipated, is stunning.  The high definition remasters reveal all sorts of visual details in the 35mm film elements that were previously obscured: the delicate play of sunlight shimmering on the surface of Meyer's Lake is now on full display, the edifices of the buildings along Mayberry's Main Street, and even the shop windows, are sharp and clear--and, perhaps it was just my imagination, but I'd swear I was able to spot the outline of a single bullet tucked inside Deputy Fife's shirt pocket.

Beyond the visual dazzle of the 32 digitally remastered episodes that make up the bulk of this collection, this set includes a number of extras that should cause even the most jaded fan to take notice. For starters, the show's origins are revealed in a gleaming print of ""Danny Meets Andy,"" the 1960 ""Danny Thomas Show"" episode that first introduced Sheriff Andy Taylor to the world.  The print used here, which appears to be an uncut high definition remaster, even includes the original animated ""Danny Thomas Show"" opening credits as well as the closing commercial, wherein Danny and Andy discuss, at some length, the virtues of Maxwell House coffee.

Speaking of in-house commercials, this set also includes a number of the commercials that ran in the closing moments of most first season ""Andy Griffith Show"" episodes when they were originally broadcast. These in-house ads, which feature the show's actors pitching various General Foods products, are quite a rare treat for fans of the series, especially since most of the spots are episode-specific, and thus provide an added coda to the episodes in which they appear.  In a nice touch, the set's menu layout gives you the choice of watching the episodes with or without the original sponsor credits and closing commercial.  While it's fun to enjoy the episodes as they originally appeared, viewers should keep in mind that the added sponsor materials are not in high definition, so it can be a little jarring jumping back and forth between the crystal-clear high definition image of the episodes and the relatively less-distinct visuals on display in the sponsor credits and commercials, which appear to have been sourced from lesser-quality 16mm elements.

Other highlights among this set's bonus materials include a 1957 Andy Griffith interview from ""Person to Person""; a high definition remaster of the 1986 reunion show, ""Return to Mayberry""; and a striking collection of gorgeous color home movies depicting life on the set of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" circa 1963, as filmed by Ron Howard's parents in the show's fourth season. These color images are hard to resist: here, in long, steady takes, we see Andy Griffith and his TV son walking along the path next to Meyer's Lake; we spy Ron Howard gliding past the Taylor home on a skateboard; and we get nice glimpses of fellow cast members Don Knotts, Jim Nabors, and Betty Lynn hanging out on the set, mugging for the camera, and just being themselves. I can't imagine any fan of the show viewing these images of backstage life on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and not being drawn in to its depiction of that happy, if long gone, time and place.

Whether the enhanced visuals of the episodes and the inclusion of these extras is enough to justify upgrading to the more expensive Blu-ray format is something each viewer has to decide for him or herself. But for a certain kind of fan, the opportunity to spend a few dollars to move even one step closer to these beloved characters and their charming world might seem a small price to pay.",1400112000,14,3852,5.1504

2110632,5,B0002NY8PI,"Comedy just doesn't get much better than this.  The acting is top notch, and the scripts are great.  Also, there are some wonderful moral lessons tucked in there, primarily between Andy and his son.  There are Biblical references, Shakespeare, and other time-tested literary mentions contained within the stories in a manner which make the episodes not only wonderful entertainment but also morally informative.",1399939200,,411,5.492063492063492
2110633,5,B0002NY8PI,"First things first: the price of this season was way out of line compared to the regular DVD seasons. Having said that, the home movies shot by the Howard family are utterly fantastic. It runs about 8.5 minutes & shows some rare behind d the scenes footage of a young Ron Howard riding a skateboard in front of the Taylor house. There are scenes of a 3 or 4 year old Clint Howard (blonde headed - the whole thing is in color) as well as a young Rance Howard hanging around the set.

The footage appears to be from the 2nd and 3rd seasons. One episode being filmed is Barneys 1st car (Hubcaps Lesh) and what appear to be some promo pieces (one which was for a TV guide cover). The footage also shows several of the crew members and it gives a peek into the real world of television production. Along with all this are scenes of Andy and Opie playing baseball alongside Don Knotts. Thelma Lou and Gomer are here as well. Truly a wonderful additional feature.

In addition, the set includes the 1986 reunion movie, the pilot from the Danny Thomas show, and an interview from 1957 with Andy Griffith and his wife.

Finally, the picture quality is stupendous, especially on a big screen TV. There are details on the actors faces that are amazing. Background details (drugstore prices, storefront signs) reveal things so much more clearly.

Bottom line: price bad, everything else outstanding. Lots of luck to you and yours.",1399852800,8,1418,4.570866141732283

These videos do not have scenes the hint that sex just happened, drug use, swearing etc. They are simply full of family values, good morals, and good lessons. The videos in this series are well done. In addition they tackle issues that many children face in their daily lives (lying, cheating on tests etc) and they do it with much humor.

There is no cussing, sex or serious violence.  The 1960's were an era when the average citizen appreciated honor, kindness and decorum and this show reflects those values.  Modern television often grieves my spirit because American values have become more lustful, violent and selfish.

2110645,5,B0002NY8PI,I watched this series in the 60s when my children were growing up.  I did not have to worry about content or conduct of the show.  There is not a show now that comes anywhere close to these moral values.,1398729600,,203,4.05
2110646,4,B0002NY8PI,"Rating this release is very difficult. For the show itself especially the first season it is no doubt 5-stars. My dvd collection of the series I noticed looks pretty good as I did a comparison of the Blu-ray release to it. The overall look of the video is a slight darker than the dvd collection which helps with outside scenes which the brightness seems to washout the scene a bit on the dvd. Another words I found the outdoors scenes to be easier on the eyes. I watched the same episode from both formats a few times trying to notice an improvement in focus, i.e. posters, calendars on the walls, wood grain, cement, etc and could not detect a difference.
  The biggest improvement is with the audio quality. Even compared to the Blu-ray itself there is a noticeable difference. Almost every episode gives you the choice to see the episode as released or with the TAGS sponsored spot at the end of the show and most times into the plot of that episode. During the opening scene the announcer's voice is more pronounced and you can clearly hear the instruments better. The announcer saying who stars in the show is different as well.
  I can not give this a 5 star due to price most people who want to own this show already have it on dvd. and it looks fine. At least the ones I own do. This release is close to being a 3. Digital copies would have made it a solid 4.
  I'll try to refrain from buying anymore until the entire series is sold as a set but I'm no good at doing that.",1398643200,,1482,4.31294964028777
2110647,4,B0002NY8PI,"Kids today are turned off by black-and-white movies and television shows, but there are exceptionslike ""I Love Lucy,"" ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" and ""The Andy Griffith Show."" Say what you will about kids, without being able to articulate why, they can sense quality. Season 1 of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" features some classic episodes (like the capture of an escaped convict via a leaky rowboat, a moonshine operation traceable to two sweet little old ladies, and a stranger who makes everyone in Mayberry uncomfortable because he knows so gosh darn much about them) and the 33 episodes are great to watch one or two at a time on the front end of Family Movie Night, like a warm-up feature. Overall the Blu-ray quality is good, with nice depth and detail, but it's not as consistently good as the CBS Home Entertainment release of ""I Love Lucy"" on Blu-ray. Some of the scenes are a little too dark and have way too much grain and noise. Fortunately those are occasional speed bumps on an otherwise smooth, nostalgic ride.

I stand firm on the rating I gave this show, and will raise my children in a way that is old fashion and far away from all the electronic craziness that kids are raised today. They stick to themselves. All communication is done through facebook email or texting. Nobody talks on the phone or comes over to peoples homes just to visit like they used to, and i WILL NOT allow my kids to be raised that way.",1394323200,,521,4.117647058823529
2110709,5,B0002NY8PI,"Growing up watching the Andy Griffith Show, I can't imagine any kid would understand the true joy of watching this show. We liked it for the story lines. It was a way of life that many of us could relate to, even if you grew up in a large city, being part of a tight neighborhood where everyone knew each other and looked after each other.
The real treasure in this show is the acting talents. Sure, Andy Griffith was excellent as a small town sheriff with the common sense to handle any situation and the personality to deal with all sorts of other personalities. But, for me, watching this show again as an adult, every second Don Knotts is on the screen, I'm in awe of his performance! What struck me as annoying as a kid, I now find amazing. He clearly is one of the great comedic legends of television. With each episode I watch, I become disappointed when he isn't featured.

Happy Days was in its prime when I was a kid. So, I certainly have been aware of Ron Howard's great success moving from actor to successful director and producer. Sure, we all knew he played ""Opie"". But now, watching him as a 6 year old actor, I've become even more appreciative of his talent. He wasn't just so darned cute (I just wanna reach thru the screen and kiss his cheeks), he already surpassed the talents of many adult actors before he knew how to sign his own autograph.

I could go on. Each character/actor helped create a masterpiece of American art. I mean...who wouldn't love their own ""Aunt Bee"". ""Floyd"" the barber - what a hoot!  I can't wait to continue the next episodes and rediscover all the characters.",1394236800,,1607,4.440677966101695
2110710,5,B0002NY8PI,This TV Show is considered a classic. This is one of the best TV shows ever on TV. I loved the lessons Andy always taught Opie.,1394150400,,127,3.923076923076923

2110715,5,B0002NY8PI,"I recommend this to all Baby Boomers born between 1945 - 1960.  Besides Don Knotts being a a primary reason for purchasing the earliest seasons of Andy Griffith, I found season 1 to include Ron Howard's (Opie""s) earliest years on television.  For those who enjoyed Ron Howard's earliest years on television, I also recomment purchasing Season 1 of Dennis the Menace.  I had forgotten that Ron Howard was one of Dennis' younger friends and in several Season 1 episodes.  It looked like Ron Howard was around the same ago and without checking, Season 1 of Andy Griffith may have been released the same year as Season 1 of Dennis the Menace.",1393632000,,638,4.7207207207207205

2110780,5,B0002NY8PI,"One of the best sitcoms ever on television, The Andy Griffith Show. Well, I liked it and I know there are many other fans of the show out there including at least two national organizations of rerun watchers who also like it. If you are a true fan of the show, this series of season sets is definitely a must for you. I have purchased seasons 1 through 5. For me, and for many hard core fans like me, the TAGS shows that were in black and white were the best, that is seasons 1 to 5. These programs had the show's icons Andy, Aunt Bee, Opie, Floyd, Gomer and the others. They also had Helen and Otis and Barney's girlfriend Thelma Lou and even Ernest T Bass, and yes, the ""fun girls."" All these characters seemed true to form and fit into the atmosphere and community that was Mayberry. With the departure of Don Knotts from the show, the chemistry that was Mayberry seemed to be diluted if not lost all together. New characters like Warren (the guy who took Barney's place as sheriff), Sam Jones, and Howard Sprague were hollow and at times rather annoying. So this first season is a gem and contains such great episodes as The New Housekeeper, in which we are first introduced to Aunt Bee and find out about Andy's home situation and the fact that he and Barney are not only best friends, but cousins.  There is also Opie's Charity (a lesson in giving) and the great Christmas Story (heartwarming episode about the true meaning of the season). In short, this first season set, indeed all of the first five season sets, are the best and most worthy of any TAGS collection.",1390262400,,1573,4.424137931034482

2110782,5,B0002NY8PI,"Season #1 deserves five stars simply because it set the scene for all series to follow.  Andy was very much a country bumpkin in this first year, which was toned down in the second year.  However, he did a marvelous job of introducing all of the Mayberry characters to a turbulent America in the 60's.",1390089600,,301,4.454545454545454

2110843,5,B0002NY8PI,"Believe me, I was not an Andy Griffith fan. When I watched it as a kid, I would roll my eyes every time Andy and Barney sat in a rocker and did nothing!  Well a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then. Three wars, undisguised hate between political parties, serial murders, terrorists, etc. I have seen enough of horror in this lifetime.

Now I am ready to go home to see Andy.  Just sitting quietly on the porch with Andy and Barney is the highlight of my day.
Country folk like the people of Mayberry were simple but had a lifetime of wisdom that allowed that simplicity.
The Andy Griffith show laughs with country folk. They are open hearted, generous, polite, and fun. They are the people
you would like to have as neighbors. Far from being stupid, they are genuinely good people.  I admire them greatly.

We are working our way forward with Andy, Opie, and Aunt Bee.  The first shows are very different.  They started with Andy as the comedian but quickly changed to having Andy become a young Abraham Lincoln character.  He lets the other stars all showcase their talent.  Opie is a wonderful little boy.  Aunt Bee is humorous and kind to a fault.  And Barney deserves his own category.
 It is no wonder that some of Andy's shows are highlighted as some of the best television shows ever broadcast.",1383091200,,1316,4.506329113924051

I still enjoy them although I must confess that the black & white episodes are the best.  Once it changed in color, Andy seemed to change his character and it wears on me.  These days, when I watch Andy Griffith, I watch the black and white episodes.  Barney is still the BEST.

2110924,1,B0002NY8PI,"The Andy Griffith Show Season One is amazing!!  I just wouldn't attempt to download on a Kindle......my experience was a disaster.
Yours however..may be just fine.

Ordered this digital version through ""One click"" on my Kindle.  On my Prime acct.
That was a smooth transaction. (as always) No issue there.  Never has been.
The trouble began when i attempted to ""download this series onto my Kindle for offline viewing
in my Library.  It took FOREVER to download anything at ALL.  and when it FINALLY registered it was finished..
I found out there was NOTHING on my machine.
The two shows that did eventually make it on there..had to be deleted.  They kept reloading every 3 seconds.
They simply were not watchable this way.

I will ""now"" have to order the DVDs of this first season, since so far I have ""nothing"".
Newer shows will download.....yet they STILL take forever.  (35 minutes to download a 27 minute program)  I will not try to download any more older or classic ones.

Andy Grittith takes you back to a time that never really existed but one we like to think did and where the folks are nice, every day is summer, and no one is in a hurry.

Of course the real draw is the everyman humor Andy Griffith does so well and of course Barney Fife (Don Knotts) plays off of him perfectly.

Great ""down-home"" humor from the original master of it.  And the series lunched the careers of both Don Knotts and Ron Howard.  Yes, little Ronnie Howard is the one and same big time movie director that brought you The DaVinci Code, Apollo 13 and best Picture and Director Oscar winner A Beautiful Mind.  But that all comes decades later.  The Andy Griffith Show is just plain fun.  Also on the disks, are commercials and promos that were made as part of the show, things that I never remember seeing.

By the way, for the trivia fans among you Andy Griffith Show fans, did you ever wonder who was whistling that famous theme?  it wasn't Andy Griffith, and wasn't some famous professional whistler.  It was the series composer himself, Earle Hagan!",1371427200,,901,4.651898734177215

2110993,3,B0002NY8PI,"Will get some flak for this but I put the first season of 'Andy' in the middle of the pack, so to speak:  not as good as seasons 2-5, but superior to seasons 6-8.  A couple of my favorite series episodes are here:

(10) Stranger in Town
(17) Alcohol and Old Lace
(22) Cyrano Andy
(30) Barney Gets His Man

There are also some beloved classic episodes in season one which include (1) The New Housekeeper, and (11) Christmas Story.  However, there are a couple of `clinkers' too.  Both the writing and acting would be refined over the next couple of seasons.

If you're going to collect them, I recommend seasons of `Andy' in this order: 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 7, 8 and 6.  There's a noticeable drop off in overall quality after season 5.  The colorized episodes of the last three seasons after Don Knotts left the show are more hit and miss.",1368748800,2,832,4.316129032258065

I still do my imatation of Aunt Bea, when I am going into my best friends house... or when I was teaching, I would do it, right B 4 I would go into the classroom...

2111012,5,B0002NY8PI,"The airing of the Andy Griffith Show each week was eagerly followed in my family when I was a boy. Although we came from a very different geography and ethnic make-up, the wit of such greats as Andy Griffith and Don Knox were irresistible and gave us insights into the traditions of American humor even if we were very young at the time. It helped that a very young Ron Howard was part of the action too, and kept our interest (as my brothers and I were closer in age to the boy than to the sheriff at the time).

In watching the show today, 50 years later, I realize that Andy Griffith took on important issues in terms of child-rearing, parenting, community service, neighborliness in difficult situations, integrity, simplicity of heart, compassion. All was done with a gentle smile and sincere efforts to bring the most diverse people together at a time when Americans were becoming aware that the world was changing. All in all, Andy Griffith, his producers and cast, covered a lot of issues in the mere 30-minutes allotted them each week. The viewers were better for it -- at least the viewers in my family where my brothers and I were still just learning how to whistle (see the opening credits for the whistled tune).

The show is sure to bring smiles to the faces of those who remember the original seasons; I hope it attracts the interest of those of younger generations who would like to see a slice of the USA in the simpler times of early 1960s.",1365984000,,1458,4.518939393939394

What is required is iWatch one stop go through the process of clicking all the buttons don't find episode to watch it go back, Go through the options again find episode three watch it, just time consuming.  A little change in the online software functionality design would be very good for watching TV shows in a series.

2111039,5,B0002NY8PI,"I love these...  Andy comes across as a a real ""country boy"", but has people smarts in dealing with what seems like innocuous life circumstances.  I think some of these early b&w episodes of 50's and 60's TV viewing have given American viewers correct behavior exposure re:  sensitizing toward family, toward friends, and toward behavior such as honoring ""the golden rule""...  sound old fashioned?  Maybe we need some of that in 21st century living.

Andy's country boy affectation is a bit much, but it works all right here.  Have you seen him in the film, ""A Face In The Crowd"", with Patricia Neal, Tony Franciosa, and Walter Mathau?  This first season seems to be a transfer of the character Andy played called, ""Lonesome Roads"" in that film, but carries far less sting of worldliness.  Go see it or rent it if you haven't.  You'll see what I mean.

Buy this season if you love Andy and Barney.  Yes!  You CAN watch it with your family...  No need to check for a film rating..... Funny stuff!  AND It's always in season.",1362700800,,1023,4.605555555555555

But I have (like nearly everyone else) always loved the show and these gifted actors. Entire cast is always first rate...the regulars, but also the ""guests"". The Guitar Player episode with James Best is on DVD number one, and that episode alone is worth the purchase price. You will easily breeze though disc 1 ...without commercials...8 great episodes...and you are on your way! There's something really nice about the brevity of these shows. You can watch as many as you like conveniently to fill any ""TV time"" interval with excellence. The packaging is nifty...4 discs, each tucked in their own slimline plastic box...clever illustrations on each box too. Terrific set! Has the CBS TV Logo after each episode....cool. Highest Recommendation!

2111069,5,B0002NY8PI,"I was born and raised in Germany and still live there. But in 2007 I got the chance to go to the U.S. for four years to work there for my company.

One day I was zapping through the channels (gosh your television is even worse than in Germany, we only have commercials every 30 minutes during a movie) and suddenly I stopped zapping because I thought I had just seen Matlock as a young man. There he was, I saw Andy Griffith in black and white and sooooo young. I wondered because in Germany he is only known as Matlock, who is grey-haired and old already. The Andy Griffith Show has never been published (aired) in Germany or anywhere in Europe as far as I know. I did't know that Andy Griffith had a career before Matlock.

So I stopped zapping and watched The Andy Griffith Show for a while and I kinda liked it. Soon I set up my VCR to record all episodes. I was simply hooked! Of couse I bought all my favorite 5 seasons over Amazon already, I really don' t like the colored ones and I also miss Barney there. I wonder if Don Knotts ever regret to part from the show?

I find it amazing that I became such a huge fan, I mean I diddn't grow up in the States, I don't know anything about the sixties and the American lifestyle and mentality back then, but to me it is the most wonderful tv series for the whole family, a treasure, just timeless!

My stay in the U.S. was in the South so I got used to the accent very well, however I cannot share this tv - show with anyone of my friends or familyhere in Germany because the Southern accent is just too difficult to understand for them and there is no German language (synchronisation) available and never will be. I understand like 90 % of what they are saying and I wish there would be subtitles available since we don't have CC in Germany. At least then I would be able to read the words that I don't understand and then get the meaning or look them up.

So you guys here are the only ones who understand my passion!

Unfortunately, Andy Griffith died last week, so I guess only Ron Howard is left.

and thanks for hours and hours of your everlasting and never dying work that (now thanks to Paramount) will be in our living rooms as long as we live!

2111070,5,B0002NY8PI,The Andy Griffith shows are a glimpse back in time.  You can enjoy them over again if you order the DVDs.  The order came promptly and in good shape.  The quality was excellent.  Each DVD gives the ending of the progam which TV doesn't always give.,1331251200,,248,4.326086956521739
2111071,5,B0002NY8PI,"Was very happy with the movie's, was exactly what i ordered and I have got my 9 month old son hooked on the andy griffith show. One thing taht you can learn from these series is respect. honesty, helping your neighbors,one thing that alot of parents does bot teach there kid's in this generation. So when me and my 9 month old son is relaxing in the recliner and watching these show's then I know when he get's older it will be a show that he can sit down on his own and watch these show's that I grew up on and learn the same thing my parent's taught me. That's the reason I am three season's away from having the complete series.",1322697600,,631,4.138211382113822

2111073,5,B0002NY8PI,"Kinda waste of time to make a review on The Andy Griffith Show.  What can you say to everyone who has watched it for years on TV, VHS & DVD'S.  The Andy Griffith show ran for years & still is because it's clean good.....humor. I'd copied a lot of the episodes from TV but the kicker at the end of the show is not there so starting the complete collection on DVD'S.  No better place than to start at the first of the show. I don't think I'll like it, I know we will as will any company we have while showing a DVD & visiting & don't have to worry if they like it or not as everyone enjoys ANDY.",1313798400,,593,3.884297520661157
2111074,5,B0002NY8PI,"Wow, so many good things about this First Season DVD set I hardly know where to start.  First, the show itself.  Andy's character in Season One is noticeably different from every other season.  He plays Andy Taylor as a constantly cheerful, at times silly, exaggeratedly down-home country bumpkin, but the kind with more ""smarts"" than city types.  All of his rural characteristics are more prominent in this season; his accent and grammar, the Southern expressions he uses, the music he plays.  Because of this, Season One is fun in a more zany way than the seasons after it.

Next, the characters.  Besides introducing some of the show's longstanding characters like Barney, Aunt Bea, Opie, Floyd, Otis, Thelma Lou, and Clara Edwards, the first season includes several great characters that didn't have as long a stay.  These include Ellie Walker, Jim Lindsey, and Emma Watson, who don't return after Season One, as well as Mayor Pike and the original Ben Weaver, who only appear in two seasons.  All five of these characters are featured in some of the show's best episodes, and it's a shame they weren't around longer.  (Side note:  Floyd is played by a different actor in his first appearance only, and Clara's last name is Johnson in hers; also, the character of Ben Weaver shows up in later seasons, but it's just not the same as the original).

Finally, the packaging and extras.  The box has a fantastic picture of Andy and Opie fishing on the front (surely at Myers Lake), and all four of the disc cases are packed with great photos, episode summaries, original air dates, trivia...just incredible for any fan of the show.  The episodes also include the endings that were clipped from TV re-runs for years, which I was happy about since TV Land used to be the only place I could see those endings.  If you're a fan of the show, you just can't go wrong with the Season One set.  Five stars, no question.",1312070400,4,1911,4.710843373493976
2111075,5,B0002NY8PI,"Good way to beat the blues; return to a simpler time.  We have watched them again and again.

Separately from Season Two on, they make you watch several long ads -- really not okay.  Not one, not two, at least three -- and long ads for other dvd's.  I have to watch them, I can't get out, so there we sit watching shows i don't want.  They won't let you go to DVD menu.",1295654400,2,369,3.9324324324324325

2111081,5,B0002NY8PI,"This is what I call the ""learning curve"" season. Watch as the characters of Andy and Barney change once Andy Griffith realises that Don Knotts should be the comedian and he the straight man.  It isn't until about the end of the season that Andy's character stops grinning after every sentence and turns from Sherrif Will Stockdale (No Time For Seargeants)into Sherriff Andy Taylor.  At the same time Barney also becomes less nervous and more like the Barney we remember. I liked Ellie as the town Pharmacist and Andy's girlfriend, so I never understood why she disappeared after season 1. The stories are mostly very good and the entertainment factor is high. ""Manhunt"", Quiet Sam"", ""Barney Gets His Man"" and ""Ellie Saves a Female"" are memorable.",1273708800,4,746,4.912698412698413
2111082,5,B0002NY8PI,"I have Seasons 1-5 of Andy, and it is quite hard to pick a best or worst one. In the first several episodes, they try to establish Andy as a dumb, dopey Sheriff who marvels at a map with magnets for markers instead of pins. They also try to make Barney out to be a hick, when really that's not his personality at all. Rather, Andy is just as sheriff in his own friendly way. Barney slowly ""evolves"" after a few episodes into the strict, zealous deputy that he is. I really don't like the fact that they eliminated Ellie Walker (Elinor Donahue), the ""lady druggist"" after this season, as she is Andy's best, and least annoying, girlfriend ever on the show. What really makes this season a winner is the part of Opie, Andy's son. He is in the first grade in this season, and he is so funny! He is actually himself, whereas in the later seasons he tries to act like a little kid when he's not. Overall, I highly reccomend this 4 DVD set to start your Any Griffith collection.",1270080000,3,972,4.288043478260869

2111084,5,B0002NY8PI,"What better way is there to learn about being a parent and friend then by watching Andy treat life like it matters. Even when he is wrong and makes poor judgement calls, he is able to say he is sorry. Oh how I wish he had been my father and then my friend. Greatest show that ever aired, sorry, but once Barney left, sob, I grieved he allowed us to see Andy at his kindest. It was Andy that taught us to care more others before we care about ourselves. Hummmmm...sounds familiar?",1266883200,,479,4.217391304347826
2111085,5,B0002NY8PI,"The Andy Griffith show is timeless television.  With near zero references to then modern plight, TAGS simply entertains us with the basics of comedy long before the era of shock, social statements, and the shortened attention span.  TAGS is about when the world wasn't spinning fast and we lived in black and white.

The New Housekeeper: Aunt Bee joins to live with the family to help take care of Opie.  Ungrateful, Opie literally prays to the Almighty she leaves.  However, Opie learns fast Aunt Bee can't take of herself and needs to stay.

The Manhunt: Aunt Bee interrupts a manhunt with fried chicken.  After the State Police pleads Andy and Barney to stay out, Barney gives the killer fugitive a firearm.  More dangerous than ever, this forces Andy to reach deep into his pocket full of tricks.

The Guitar Player: The Elvis of Mayberry needs a break to get into the business.  Andy leverages his influences as a law enforcement officer to give a jerk with a guitar an audience.  Watchable episode, annoying character.

Runaway Kid: Opie withholds an awful truth from Andy as he takes in a little boy looking for shelter.

Opie's Charity: For years, the truth of a man's death is buried.  Until, he rises from his grave and walks the streets of Mayberry!  Meanwhile, Andy frowns on Opie's pursuit to buy a coat for one of the town's poorest.

Ellie Comes to Town: Young, pretty, and smart, Ellie is a stickler to rules and pharmacy law.  This irks the townsfolk.  One of them needing pills to live.  Unmoved, Ellie watches an old woman lie in her death bed.

Irresistible Andy: Newcomer Ellie discovers the town has chosen her to marry the high sheriff, Andy.  Angry, she decides to fight off the Wicker Man.

A Feud is a Feud: Andy refuses to marry a young couple in love until their respective families continues feuding.  Considering himself a modern Shakespeare, Andy rewrites Romeo & Juliet.

Andy the Matchmaker: Andy runs an elaborate plot involving crime and deception to give Barney the courage to ask a demure, spinster for a date.  We will never see her again.

Stranger in Town: He comes to Mayberry with a smile and knowledge of all who lives there.  This shadowy stranger threatens to corner the market of gasoline in Mayberry and take one of the women. Andy decides to step in but not before an angry mob gathers.  A disturbing episode.

Christmas Story: Ben Weaver, the man in black, is Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Using ""old-school"" politicking, he has a moonshiner nemesis locked up on Christmas Eve.  Hilarity ensues.

Ellie for Council: A woman running for office?  Oh the humanity!  Maybe the one episode that is certainly dated.  ""We want Ellie!  We want Ellie!""

Mayberry Goes Hollywood: A filmmaker sets his camera for the genuine charm of Mayberry.  The mayor and townsfolk, drunk with glee and self-congratulation, decide to chop down the town's oldest tree in an offering of tribute.  Andy, sober, steps in and brings reality to the world of fantasy.

The Horse Trader: Deriding his son for unethical behavior, Andy picks up Opie's business practices to offload the town's rusty canon on an unsuspected visitor.

Those Gossipin Men: A quiet, humble man with a stack of shoe boxes takes up a room at the Mayberry Hotel during a time of rampant rumor mongering infesting the town and its folk.  His business routine is interrupted with inane proposals for show business.

Andy Saves Barney's Morale: Power hungry and ignorant, Barney arrests Mayberry's prominent citizens.  When none of his charges stick, its time to consider a new deputy.  Or is it?

Alcohol and Old Lace: In the dog house with his teacher, Opie searches for the legendary ""flower-making machine"" to win favors from the gods.  Meanwhile, Andy and Barney discover a moon shining operation they can't seem to break.

Andy and the Marriage Counselor: Making light on the social ills of domestic violence, Andy tries his best on lecturing communication skills.  He fails.

Mayberry on Record: Like Moses from the mountaintop, a well-dressed man bewilders Mayberry with his tape recorder the size of a baby elephant.  Recording blabber and milk jug bands, he convinces the town folk to ask him to invest their savings.  When he skips town, an all out manhunt begins.

The Beauty Pageant: Hand-picked to be sole judge of a hastened produced beauty pageant, Andy learns the world of vote-buying.  He keeps looking at Ellie, but she is unimpressed with frivolous celebration of physical beauty.

Andy and the Gentleman Crook: The renown villain, Gentleman Dan, is captured and imprisoned in Mayberry.  His powers of persuasion and illusion wins him freedom until Andy arrives just in time.

Cyrano Andy: Barney tries again for a steady in Thelma Lou.  However, he needs Andy's help in delivering the lines.  Thelma Lou, expects more effort from her men, teaches the boys a lesson.

Andy and Opie, Housekeepers: Aunt Bee goes on a trip.  Clara cleans Andy's house. Aunt Bee insults Clara.

The New Doctor: A new doctor moves into Mayberry and talks about an engagement with Ellie.  Seems no likes the new doctor and is never seen again after this episode.

A Plaque for Mayberry: A mysterious search for the last living descendant of famed Nathan Tibbs leads to Otis the town drunk.  He celebrates with a speech and new shoes.

The Inspector: A state bureaucrat is appalled at the law enforcement practices he discovers at the Mayberry courthouse.  Even witnessing Barney lock himself behind bars isn't enough to write up a reprimand.  The inspector is later whisked away.

Ellie Saves a Female: Cosmetics, perfume, and a pair of white gloves buys a farmer a son-in-law and steals handwork from his competition with talents only a woman can offer. A very dry episode, not my favorite.

Andy Forecloses: A show mirroring our economic times, Andy begrudgingly fulfills his duty by kicking a family out of Ben Weaver's house because they stop paying their legally obligated debts.  Since no one likes Ben Weaver, Andy comes up with ways to skirt the law.

Quiet Sam: A decorated Korean War veteran stocks up on supplies and holes up at his home as law enforcement posse waits for him outside.

Barney Gets His Man: Running from the law, a fugitive is body chopped by martial arts expert, Barney Fife.  Obsessed with vengeance, the convict escapes and pursues Barney.  A one-on-one confrontation is destined.

The Guitar Player Returns: Loss of fame and fortune, hack guitar player Jim Lindsey returns to Mayberry.  He soaks the town with his debts and plots a way to escape.  Watch the 1960's interpretation of the repo-man.

Bringing Up Opie: Aunt Bee, never married and no children, shoves parenting advice onto Andy.  Opie becomes despondent as his future involves turnip farming.  It takes a near-death experience of Opie before Bee swallows her pride.",1263859200,,6836,4.895287958115183
2111086,5,B0002NY8PI,"What can I say? This show was without question, a 60s sitcom classic. It's at least in the same league as other superb sitcoms of it's era, such as Gilligan's Island, The Beverly Hillbillies, or The Dick Van Dyke Show.

Some say that the earlier episodes of the show, were the very best. These were the episodes that featured Deputy Barney Fife, Earnest T. Bass, Gomer Pyle, Otis the drunk, Floyd the barber, etc. Those characters were wonderfully hilarious, to say the least. I thought that the last few seasons of the show, were also excellent. These were broadcast during the late 60s.

By the time the newer episodes in the late 60s appeared, the characters in the early episodes of the show were long gone. At that time, a new menagerie of supporting cast members joined the show. These new characters were different, but just as funny as the ones on the older episodes. My favorites from the newer episodes, were county clerk Howard Sprague, grease-monkey (and Gomer's cousin) Goober Pyle, and Emmett the appliance dealer. I thought that the later shows, also showed more depth and maturity in the plot-lines, than the earlier shows did.

The chemistry between the cast members, was what made this show so good. Don Knotts as Barney Fife, was a very talented comedian. His high-strung comedic mannerisms, were priceless. Andy Griffith's laid-back character Sheriff Taylor, was a perfect contrast against Barney's jumpy persona. Though the other characters were certainly very entertaining, the scenes between Andy and Barney, were the most enjoyable to watch on this show.

The Andy Griffith show, was among the best of the 60s family sitcoms. It was very-well written, and each episode had a moral lesson to it, without being too preachy. It was always a show of stellar quality, and I highly recommend it.",1262044800,,1813,4.915032679738562

2111091,4,B0002NY8PI,"I will not try to discribe the characters, I doubt there is anyone in the country that has not seen the show at least a few times.
The best comedy is simply exaggerated real life. And that is exactly what this is, the stories that you would find in any small
town blown out of proportion just enough to make them funny.
The series is charming and funny. And gets better as it goes along. I`m giving the 1st season 4 stars instead of 5 because in
the 1st season they struggled a bit to find their footing. But by the 2nd season they had hit their stride, knew exactly where
they were going with the show, and went full steam ahead and into classic tv history.

Andy is more hillbilly-ish  than in any other season but he still does a pretty good job in this season.  Barney is absolutely hilarious in ""Barney Gets His Man""  This is probably one of my favorite episodes on this season.  Andy's first girlfriend is on this season.  Her name is Ellie.  Although funny at times I don't really like her that well overall.  One thing that is weird is that there are two different Floyd the Barber's.  In the first two episodes with Floyd in them he is a really old guy but, after that it's the Floyd that we've all come to know and love.

2111103,5,B0002NY8PI,"ABSOLUTE CLASSIC!!! There might not be a better show in the history of television than the Andy Griffith Show. The entire cast was phenomenal, the writing outstanding, the directing impeccable. It's simply amazing the perfection the show attained; sure, there were some glitches, there was an occasional lapse in continuity, yet the show is timeless. It captured its time perfectly & we can't help but to look back at it nostalgically wishing things were still this simple & problems so easily solved. Sheriff Andy Taylor seemed to be able to solve almost any problem & yet he was human also, making mistakes & sometimes even being taught a valuable lesson by his own young son, Opie.

The show's cast was one of the most capable ever assembled, in particular the casting of Don Knotts who would win five Emmy Awards in five seasons for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Ron Howard & Frances Bavier were excellent also. Other famous supporting characters included Otis Campbell, the town drunk (portrayed by Hal Smith, appeared in a total of 32 episodes), the only one who appeared in the first season; Gomer Pyle (portrayed by Jim Nabors, appeared in only 23 episodes); & Ernest T. Bass (portrayed by Hal Morris, appeared in only 8 episodes). Hal Morris would also direct several episodes. There were many more characters that had semi-regular roles but these were the most famous & popular. In particular, the character Ernest T. Bass's fame goes way beyond his eight appearances.

The first season of The Andy Griffith Show has 32 episodes, MANY of them are classics of the series, in fact, the first eleven episodes are highlights of the entire series. It's not until ""Stranger in Town"" that the individual episodes dip below the five star level. The episode ""Opie's Charity"" is one of the absolute best. There are way too many outstanding episodes to mention, there's not a bad one in the bunch.

There aren't any bonus features which is a shame considering the historical importance of the series. There are four discs in the set each stored in its own slim case. Each case has an episode listing on the disc with a synopsis. Good family entertainment doesn't come any better than this.",1220745600,3,2200,4.845744680851064
2111104,5,B0002NY8PI,"Many mainstream television critics assert that ""Seinfeld"" is the best comedy program ever produced. While ""Seinfeld"" had its funny moments, it featured a cast of some of the most unlikeable and least redeemable characters in television history. Celebrating a program about four utter narcissists who look upon other people as mere objects to be used and discarded is more than passing strange, no matter how popular it was (and still is).

No, the greatest television comedy ever produced is ""The Andy Griffith Show."" Even though it is set in a rural, Southern small town in the early 1960's, the writing is so good that it is essentially timeless. In addition, rather than laughing at the characters, one laughs and even empathizes with them. We recognize our own failures, foibles and follies in the cavalcade of characters -- Sheriff Andy Taylor, Aunt Bea, Floyd Lawson, Gomer Pyle, and all of the rest. Even the egocentric blowhard Barney Fife earns our grudging love, because -- deep down -- he is a basically decent and good human being.

There is a reason why ""The Andy Griffith Show"" remains so enormously popular long after its original exhibition, and other comedies before and since have been forgotten. The producers of the program respected the audience and put together a quality product that appealed to the better angels of our nature. Even when ""Seinfeld"" has become painfully outdated and unfunny, new audiences will appreciate and enjoy ""The Andy Griffith Show.""",1216339200,6,1481,5.065573770491803

2111109,5,B0002NY8PI,"Being an Andy Griffith fan, there is no way I could not get this season.  Actually, this was the last of all 8 that I got.

Not my favorite season, because I found Andy and a few others a bit too ""folksy and friendly"".  By Season 3, Andy gets more irritated with Barney's and Gomer's antics - I guess that is more my thing. But to each his own. Barney hits the ground running in this first season and is as good as in any other. And there are a few of my favorites in this season, particularly the show with Mr. Finch and the gossiping men - the first time I saw that one I nearly fell on the floor laughing.

So if I were only going to buy only one season, I probably wouldn't get this season.  But who am I kidding?  I don't think it is humanly possible to not get all 8 seasons.  So you might as well save some money and buy the whole set.

This season, like all the rest, gets a 5 from me.",1199923200,,893,3.8950276243093924

2111112,5,B0002NY8PI,"I'm resorting to this forum to briefly review three super Andy Griffith TV movies, especially for Andy Griffith fans. These movies are NOT yet available on either VHS or DVD as far as I can discover.... but you might catch them on TV if you're lucky. They are: ""The Girl in the Empty Grave"" (1977); ""Deadly Game"" (a.k.a., ""It's Deadly,"" 1977), and; ""Winter Kill"" (1974).

All three of these films are ""cosy murders"" where Andy Griffith plays a small-town California police chief/sheriff -- they all sort of manifest the general flavor of his TV series but are just a little more serious. In the first two films, he plays police chief Abel Marsh and in the latter he plays Sheriff Sam McNeill.

The supporting cast includes timeless characters, (some are just a little goofy), reminiscent of the TV series. The locations are spectacular in a little resort town in the mountains of Northern California. The sets are also very good.

In ""The Girl in the Empty Grave,"" police chief Abel Marsh tries to track down a girl who was supposedly killed in a car wreck but who has been seen driving through his tiny resort town once her parents have been murdered.

In ""Deadly Game,"" the U.S. Military creates a chemical spill when one of their trucks overturns... murder ensues and police chief Abel Marsh ATTEMPTS to investigate but runs into problems. It's a nice folksy mystery for a rainy Saturday afternoon.

In ""Winter Kill"" Sheriff Sam McNeill works to solve the mystery of a sniper in his little ski resort town. A young Nick Nolte appears in the supporting cast!

If you enjoyed The Andy Griffith Show don't miss these three fun films. Hopefully, the copyright owners will reduce them to DVD very soon but there's a chance that if you scan the TV Guide, you can catch them on television.

Please comment if this information was helpful to you -- I'd like to enter more posts like this one on films not yet available if it helps out viewers and fans.",1198886400,4,1947,4.658892128279883

What surprises me most is how well scripted the show is (of course the writers were lucky to have the perfect cast to work with) and the comedy doesn't feel dated even if the situations perhaps are.

The story is set in the fictitious little town of Mayberry, North Carolina during the early 1960s. Sheriff Andy Taylor (played by Andy Griffith) is a widower with a small son. He asks his Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) to move in with him and Opie (Ron Howard) as housekeeper and surrogate mother.

Many of the storylines center upon Opie's childhood dilemmas and coming-of-age situations. While Andy is quick to discipline his son, he is also understanding of the gray areas a child might encounter, and no matter the outcome of a situation, he strives to enforce in Opie the need for kindness and truth.

Other storylines focus upon Barney Fife (played by Don Knotts) as Andy's cousin and the town's deputy sheriff. Thanks to Barney's false pride and need to appear all-knowing, Andy spends much of his time trying to straighten out various situations that might otherwise have never occurred. Still, it's apparent that Barney has a good heart, and his sense of humor more than make up for the trouble he often stirs up.

Mayberry also includes a number of unique residents, such as Floyd, the kindhearted but vague barber; Otis, the town drunk who is trusted to let himself into his cell as needed; Barney's ever-patient girlfriend, Thelma Lou; and Andy's girlfriend Ellie, a Northerner who recently moved to town to run her ailing uncle's drugstore.

It was almost as if part of my own family had died also. I'll always remember the funny antics of Don Knotts and all of the Andy Griffith shows.",1142380800,6,606,4.100840336134453

All in glorious B/W. I recomended season 2, and I allready got season 3 on order. The all time favorite in our family.",1122508800,2,292,4.425925925925926
2111157,5,B0002NY8PI,"Whether you're a casual fan or a devotee who has attempted to collect all 249 episodes of the show, you'll probably enjoy the DVD ""Andy Griffith Show"" collections.

Strengths:  DVD convenience; picture/sound quality; all episodes uncut (no editing for time slots or political correctness).  You can watch all the episodes from each season of the show in their entirety and in any order you want.  If you've ever taken on the challenge of video taping the reruns (let alone succeeded in doing so), it's easy to appreciate the user-friendliness of DVD.  For the most part, the picture and sound quality is excellent.  It should be remembered that the originals were shot on film that is now roughly 40 years old.  I don't know anything about how this collection was transferred to DVD, but it's not of great concern as even the shots that show some age are an enormous improvement over anything you've seen before on TV.  The clarity is great -- if you've seen the show so many times you know it by heart, the DVD picture quality will give you the added fun of playing with the ""Zoom"" and ""Pause"" buttons to zoom in on that framed newspaper article, or that license plate, or anything else in-frame that you feel like investigating!

Weaknesses:  This is definitely a ""no-frills"" DVD set.  The season 1 collection is just that.  Just the episodes and abolutely nothing else.  Season 2 does contain the original Sanka and Post cereals ads (and presumably Season 3 will as well).  That's the only bonus material you'll find, but they are quite entertaining -- since I wasn't around when the show originally aired, I've never seen these before and they are a treat to watch.  Some are amusing; some are delightful.  The only quibble I have with their inclusion is that, while they are on the disc, they're separated from their corresponding episodes.  In the original broadcast format, each ad was somewhat tied in to the storyline of the episode it went with, and you don't quite get the same continuity here.  I don't have a fancy DVD player, so I can either watch all the episodes and then watch all the ads, or I can watch the episodes one by one and then go hunting for the ad that went with it.  I'd rather they were more seamlessly included -- but as I said, that's a very minor issue.

It's a little disappointing, but not particularly surprising, that the sponsor spots are the ONLY special feature you'll find.  No ""behind-the-scenes"" or ""cast interviews"" or anything.  On the other hand, although I'd really like to see such material included on future season releases, shallow or poorly made special features are worse than none at all, in my opinion.  I'm just happy to have the show on DVD (finally!).  Diehard fans will not miss bonus features anyway if they pick up a copy of ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" by Richard Kelly.  First published in 1981, it's a little bit dated now but still arguably the best companion to have if you're a serious TAGS fan.",1122249600,4,2960,4.678916827852998
2111158,5,B0002NY8PI,"A ""pilot"" episode was done on an episode of The Danny Thomas Show.  I saw it once, years ago.  It's very interesting, and it's a shame it wasn't included as a bonus feature on this DVD set.  I wish the people who put these DVD sets together, would care enough to include things like this.  [Similarly, episodes of Homicide: Life on the Streets that were crossover episodes with Law and Order, only have the Homicide episodes on their DVD season box sets.  Rather frustrating.]",1121299200,,476,4.619047619047619

So we have to go back 40-some odd years and we're STILL in love with all these characters.

The quality is of course, excellent with the sound crisp and clear. Its packaging is also reminescent of symbols from the 60's, the show, and the South. You will absolutely not go wrong, and your dollar will be well-spent.

It is the beginning of a life that many yearn for in certain ways. So sit a spell, and enjoy how life used to be, courtesy of the folks in Mayberry.",1120953600,,887,4.6075949367088604

Other reviewers refer to some of the following seasons as the best, but there are some really good things to like about the first season.  For one thing, it's so fresh and new.  I also think Opie is great.  After seeing him so young it's hard to picture him as a 10-year-old!  I laugh every episode, and since I bought the show for the episodes I do not mind that there aren't any extras.  My favorite episodes are ""Opie's Charity,"" ""Ellie for Council,"" and ""Ellie Saves a Female""--although all of them are great.  What a fantastic show!!",1120262400,,630,4.417391304347826

As a matter of fact I canceled my cable subscription and with the money I save each month I buy DVD's. No more searching endlessly through hundreds of channels to try and find something good to watch. I get to watch all of the shows I like without those annoying commercials.

2111164,5,B0002NY8PI,"The first season of the legendary Andy Griffith Show includes a few elements that would change as the series developed.  The main change is the character Andy Taylor.  In these early episodes, Andy is shown as a goofy hick.  Later, Andy would develop into the wise, small-town sheriff and straight man to the comedic genius of Don Knotts.  Certain details also reveal that the writers weren't exactly sure where to go with the characters.  Barney Fife is introduced as Andy's cousin, for example.  Still, the greatness of the series was there from the start. I am surprised that the Make Room for Daddy (Danny Thomas Show) episode that introduced the world to Andy is not included but, still, this set is ""really big; Big, Big.""  Here are the 32 (wow!) episodes from the first season which originally aired in 1960-1:

The New Housekeeper: It's hard to believe that Opie did not like Aunt Bee when she first arrived to replace a beloved housekeeper.  Here, Barney is introduced as Andy's cousin.  It would not remain that way, of course.

The Manhunt: The state police search for an escaped convict in Mayberry and do not want the local small-town force involved.

The Guitar Player: Andy schemes to get local guitar phenom Jim Lindsey (played by James Best, best known for his role as Rosco Coletrane in The Dukes of Hazzard) in a traveling jazz band Bobby Fleet and his Band with a Beat (once referred to as ""Freddie Fleet..."").

Runaway Kid: Andy's ""Golden Rule"" lesson to Opie about never ratting out a friend backfires when Opie brings home an 8-year-old runaway.

Opie's Charity: Andy is furious when Opie donates a ""measly three cents"" to a children's charity drive.  No Barney in this one.

Ellie Comes to Town: Ellie Walker (played by Elinor Donahue formerly of Father Knows Best fame) is introduced as the new ""lady druggist"" who is unaware how things work in Mayberry, especially concerning Emma Watson's pills.  Ellie was my favorite of Andy's girlfriends.  She was much more cute and bubbly than the woman Andy ended up with (sour Helen Crump).

Irresistible Andy: Andy thinks Ellie has plans of matrimony for him so he decides to put her ""on the scent of other game.""

A Feud is a Feud: Andy becomes Fryer Lawrence in his attempt to end an 87-year feud between the Wakefield and Carter families that is interfering with a young couple's wedding plans.

Andy the Matchmaker: Barney shy?!  In the beginning he was.  Andy tries to get him set up with a librarian-looking old maid known only as Miss Rosemary who refers to her potential suitor as ""Mr. Fife.""  I am glad they did not carry on with this pathetic storyline.

Christmas Story:  Ben Weaver is a modern-day Scrooge [perfect casting for this role].

Stranger in Town: A stranger comes to Mayberry who knows everything about the town and its residents and the townspeople are freaked out by it.

Ellie for Council: The men of Mayberry are up-in-arms when they find out Ellie Walker is running for town council.

Mayberry Goes to Hollywood: A movie producer wants to use Mayberry as the back drop for a film.  His plans for a small-town setting are dashed when the town guzzies itself up for the occasion.  One of my favorites.

The Horse Trader: Ignoring his own advice to Opie, Andy plays fast and loose with the facts when trying to sell the old town cannon.

The Gosspin' Men: Do men gossip?  Aunt Bee thinks so when she starts a rumor about a salesman in town.

Andy Saves Barney's Morale: So what else is new?  Here, Barney is sheriff for a day--and arrests the whole town.

Alcohol & Old Lace: One of my favorites.  Two old ladies (not unlike ""the recipe"" ladies on The Waltons) knock out their competition by leading Andy and Barney on a still-smashing spree.  It's OK to sell the good stuff on special occasions, of course.

Andy & the Marriage Counselor: Andy tries to get the bickering Boones in the habit of getting along.  Now the townspeople must be recipients of their pent-up wrath.  A favorite of mine.

Mayberry on Record: The folks of Mayberry invest their money in a folk album of local talent.  Andy suspects the promoter to be a con artist.  Could Andy be wrong about this one?  Features bluegrass musicians who would become the Kentucky Colonels.

The Beauty Contest: Another favorite of mine.  Andy is sole judge of a beauty contest for Founder's Day and finds out it is a bad position to be in, especially with Floyd's niece and Mayor Pike's homely daughter among the contestants.

Andy & the Gentlman Crook: Con man Dan Caldwell is incarcerated in the Mayberry jail and nearly makes a clean get-away on his ""word as a gentleman.""

Cyrano Andy: Barney is having trouble with his love life?  How can that be?

Andy & Opie, Housekeepers: Andy may be wrong when he thinks Aunt Bee wants to see a clean house when she returns from visiting a relative.

The New Doctor: A handsome young doctor arrives in Mayberry and Barney gets Andy worried that he may have his sites on Ellie.

A Plaque for Mayberry: The townspeople can't await to honor the last descendant of a Revolutionary War hero, until they find out it is the town drunk, Otis.

The Inspector:  Another favorite of mine.  A by-the-book courthouse inspector does not like what he sees in the Mayberry jail from the frilly doilies in the cells to Andy's way of handling a violent moonshiner.  Andy walking right in the line of fire of the armed and scared moonshiner  is classic. Andy rules!

Ellie Saves a Female:  A female farmhand has never used ""female war paint"" and perfume to show off her femininity and Ellie wants to change this despite the protest of the farmhand's father.

Andy Forecloses: Ben Weaver insists Andy evict a financially-troubled young couple from their home.  Andy decides to open Ben's eyes by being even more cruel than the gruff department store owner.

Quiet Sam: Barney is suspicious of a mysterious farmer until he finds out the reason for the farmer's preoccupation.

Barney Gets His Man: Barney captures an escaped con who vows revenge.

The Guitar Player Returns: Jim Lindsey returns to Mayberry to a hero's welcome after leaving Bobby Fleet to set out on his own.  His decision to go solo is not a good one.

Bringing Up Opie: Aunt Bee forbids Opie to spend time at the courthouse because she believes it is a bad influence.",1114041600,21,6306,4.697716894977169
2111165,5,B0002NY8PI,"One of the most beloved shows in television history, The Andy Griffith Show takes its viewers back to a simpler time of small town America, apple pie, and black and white television... The trademark whistling theme song is one of the most recognizable in history, and the duration of the show in syndicated reruns is unrivaled by its peers.

The Andy Griffith Show follows the exploits of the small town of Mayberry and its family values, no nonsense sheriff Andy. Widowed, and father to a small boy named Opie, Andy is joined in Mayberry by his sidekick Deputy Barney Fife, his relative and housekeeper Aunt Bee, and a host of other eccentric characters.

But the show stealer is Barney Fife (Don Knotts) who plays the role of a sometimes incompetent, kooky deputy always in over his head. The onscreen dynamic between Griffith and Knotts is truly magical. Both men would go on to heralded careers in show business with Knotts starring in numerous roles, such as Mr. Furley on Three's Company, and Griffith as the title star of Matlock. Ron Howard (Opie) would go on to establish himself as one of Hollywood's most well-known directors...

This Season 1 DVD of The Andy Griffith Show is packed with some of the best episodes in the show's history. Episodes 3 and 31 feature the talented guitar playing of actor James Best, better known as Rosco P. Coltrane on The Dukes Of Hazzard, a hit television show of the late 1970's and early 1980's. Various other famous faces crop up in season 1, and if you look closely enough, you might even see the Maytag repairman...

2111166,5,B0002NY8PI,"As a child I grew up watching reruns of TAGS and MAYBERRY R.F.D. and believe it or not I was a young teenager before I realized that Mayberry was not a real town.  I had actually hoped to visit and maybe even move to Mayberry.  Oh well, the  innocence of youth, how I miss it. Well I may not be able to vist Mayberry in person but this DVD set of Season One is the next best thing.

Season One is so very good for so many reasons.  It introduces us to Andy & company, and Mayberry.  It's like watching a Norman Rockwell painting put to film, albeit a black & white Norman Rockwell painting.  The first season has many of the problems that most first season shows do as it struggles to define characters.  For example in episode 2, ""The Manhunt"", Emma Brand lives in the country.  In episode 4, ""Ellie Comes to Town"", Emma Brand lives in what appears to be downtown Mayberry.  Is the town barbershop owned by Colby or Floyd?  It's little discrepancies like these that stand out to the fans of TAGS, and are kind of fun to point out.

Perhaps the best thing about Season One is Andy himself.  In Season One Andy is not quite as sage as he would become in later seasons.  He puts his foot in his mouth quite a few times and learns from his mistakes. Andy is also a lot more jovial than he is in later seasons.  As the series advanced Andy became more serious and characters like Barney, Gomer and Goober took on the more humorous roles.

Lastly, extra features would have been nice and or the addition of the MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY episode that actually introduced Andy, Aunt Bee and Opie. However, considering the first season has 32 episodes that are uncut and an excellent image I'm not going to complain.",1111708800,6,1702,4.321766561514195

2111169,5,B0002NY8PI,"That's right, they're on the way! May 25th, 2005 is the ""official"" release date of The Andy Griffith Show: Season #2. Once again, thank you Paramount!",1110067200,6,150,4.8076923076923075
2111170,5,B0002NY8PI,"Those who complain about the lack of extras (cast/crew interviews & voice-overs, etc) should bear in mind that the DVD version has 2-3+ extra minutes of the actual SHOW that haven't been seen for over 40 years! For instance, the scene in ""Quiet Sam"" where Barney makes a marijuana-growing reference- that's right, Marijuna! This scene has never been shown in the chopped up, money-grubbing syndicated version. Many other great scenes have been hacked off over the years to cram in more commericals- the average sitcom in the 1960s was twenty-six minutes long!

  I am a purist and would love to see the original closing credits with the product pictures, but the legal issues involved in this are probably a logistical nightmare, and that version of the credits may be lost or destroyed anyway- after all, this show aired almost fifty years ago! The original opening credits, if I recall, also had a ""Brought to You By General Electric"" credit that appeared on screen just after Opie tosses the stone across the pond, which is why in syndication the ""cut"" that ends the opening credits often seems jagged (sometimes it cuts off the ""rock toss"" scene altogether; other times the cut occurs a second or two after the toss). Just a boring bit of TAGS trivia. BTW, many shows of this era had special little sequenes in the credits that highlighted a major sponsor- ""Alfred Hitchock Presents"" has a Bristol-Meyers Squibb ad after Hitch's opening monolouge- I've noticed on re-runs they often crudely chop off Hitch's last sentence because the camera starts to pan towards the ad before he's done talking.

  Lastly, those who clamor for extras should know that its not a simple matter of just finding the tape of an old promo, commerical, or pilot episode and slapping it on DVD. The primary purpose of ALL television programming is to extract as much money as possible from the content, and thus any piece of film that airs on commerical TV carries with it a vast tangle of complex, contractual legal issues. Resolving these issues takes time and lawyers, which are obviously very expensive. I'd rather pay less and get the shows themselves released faster than have the studio spend 2 years and $200,000 trying to get the rights to some obscure old ads or promos, etc. Just my two cents.",1109548800,20,2284,4.828644501278772

2111172,3,B0002NY8PI,"Barney Fife has three different middle names: P., Milton, and Oliver. Clara Edwards is also known as Clara Johnson. Goober Pyle was once Goober Beasley. Dozens of other inconsistencies abound. I'm saying that with all the digitilization on DVD today they should be able to edit so many of these innacuarcies out. Including the innacuaracy in the first ep or two when it's mentioned that Barney and Andy are cousins (a fact forgotten for nearly the rest of the show).",1109116800,4,466,4.8375

After being suckered by every unauthorized, bootleg, projector-quality, substitute-theme-song, ""best-of"", etc... collection, many with different names for the same episodes to mask the fact that you're getting the same ""oops, we forgot to renew the copyright"" ones over and over again (""dogs, dogs, dogs"" - I must have 5 copies in different sets), Paramount has seen the light and released the 1st season.

Most episodes were properly copyrighted and so haven't been released before in any other sets.  They are in their original broadcast edits with no cuts for more commercial time.  And the quality of the images is great - the best I've ever seen, as if Paramount either got ahold of the original prints or did a really good restoration job (or both).  There are a few strange digital effects (Andy's striped tie in ""The Inspector"" seems to be lit from within, for example) but thankfully nothing more serious.

Some cast/crew/writer interviews might have been a nice addition, but I understand how the TAGS family may have grown tired of it all in recent years, what with multiple specials and books.  They are a humble, retiring bunch.

Please, please Paramount - don't stop with Season 1!!!",1108944000,11,1238,4.975728155339806
2111174,5,B0002NY8PI,"The Andy Griffith Show is loved from coast to coast, but it's especially important to a fellow like me who has spent all of his life in the great state of North Carolina.  Around these parts, The Andy Griffith Show is more than just a TV show.  Just about everybody under the age of 50 has grown up with Andy, Barney, Aunt Bee, Opie, Floyd, Otis, and the whole Mayberry gang.  And, no matter how many times I see a particular episode, I never get tired of watching it.  I've seen the 32 shows from Season One more times than I can remember, but watching them again on these DVDs was even better than seeing them for the first time on television.  As time goes by, this show actually grows in importance.  Mayberry is more than a place; it's a paradise on earth, a way of life many of us yearn for.  Heck, I live in a small town now, but it doesn't feel like a small town anymore.  I'm all for progress, but no life is as satisfying as the simple life in a calm, lazy town where you not only know everybody, you actually like everybody.  Folks is just folks in Mayberry, and I would move there in a heartbeat if I could.  Maybe a criminal wanders into town once every blue moon, but old reliable Barney Fife is always there to nip criminal activity in the bud (and Andy is there to see that Barney succeeds despite himself).  About the worst thing that ever happens in Mayberry is Aunt Bee deciding to make a run of pickles.  This is truly the life, and The Andy Griffith Show The Complete First Season lands a spot smack dab on top of my stack of favorite DVDs.

The first season doesn't have some of the big-name episodes (e.g., the Fun Girls or Citizen's Arrest), but it's my favorite season of them all.  It takes a few episodes to settle in, though; in the first few episodes, Andy comes across as a real local yokel, and the comedy sometimes comes at the expense of the South that I love so dearly.  Pretty soon, though, the comedy refines itself into good old country humor.  The show was never just about making people laugh, though.  It's instructive in the way sit-coms used to be.  It's not easy for a widower to raise a precocious young'un like Opie, but this father and son learn life's lessons together.

I don't even have to describe Barney Fife, as I can't imagine there is anyone who is unfamiliar with one of TV's greatest characters.  Barney wasn't in every episode early on, but it didn't take long for the local deputy sheriff to start stealing the show week in and week out.  And just imagine this - week in and week out, a new episode of the show aired.  No mid-season reruns here.  I don't think we'll ever again see the day when a show airs 32 episodes in a single season.  Not only did this show deliver up a new show every week, every single episode was a classic.

I won't try to describe every individual episode; you've probably seem all of them already at some point, anyway.  I will, however, emphasize the point that these are the complete, uncut episodes.  I had never seen a good many of the short epilogues because those are invariably cut out of syndication - in a number of cases, the story truly isn't complete without the epilogues.  And sakes alive, the audio and video quality of these episodes is nothing short of glorious.  Gone are the days when you have to buy little DVD collections of random episodes, many of them of questionable quality.  The Andy Griffith Show's first 32 episodes look, sound, and play better now than they ever have before.

This is the epitome of good, wholesome, hilarious family entertainment.  As far as I'm concerned, The Andy Griffith Show ought to have a place in every household.  TV (and now DVD) just doesn't get any better than this.",1108512000,16,3712,4.411764705882353

2111176,4,B0002NY8PI,"The Andy Griffith Show-DVD Box Set 2004 Edition

The Complete First Season (1960-1961)

Starring Andy Griffith, Don Knotts, and Ronny Howard

This DVD box set contains the 32 black and white episodes of The Andy Griffith Show in its first season that aired on the American television network, CBS, in the 1960's and was filmed at Desilu Studios in Los Angeles, California.

This DVD set includes 4 discs and individual display cases with pictures and information snippets about the cast from the show.  Each disk in their display case list the title, description, and the original U.S. airing date of each individual episode.  The DVD's are one sided which allows easy recognition of what side of the disc to play in a DVD unit.  There is a selection menu on each individual DVD disk for each episode.  However, there is no selection menu for individual scenes for an episode.  So, if you stop for a break and come back to view the disk where you left off, it may take you awhile to find a particular scene that you were viewing earlier.

The down--home humor of The Andy Griffith Show  which presents home town U.S.A. at its best, is a wonderful series for the family to enjoy in any generation.  The episodes in the DVD set are of great quality and are highly recommended both artistically and technically.  However, there are no special features segments such as The Andy Griffith Show sponsor's promos and interviews with the cast and crew from the show that have been available to the public on other DVD/VHS products for years.  I believe the distributors have missed out by not doing special features for sound business reasons to promote their products for now and in the future. Most of all, it would have been beneficial and respectful to have taken the time to add some special features to this classic series as a special tribute to the cast, crew, and producers of The Andy Griffith Show.

I give this DVD Box Set 2004 Edition of The Andy Griffith Show--The Complete First Season distributed by Paramount Studios/Viacom International, Inc., 4 Out of 5 Stars.",1107302400,11,2071,4.745810055865922

For years, I've seen small, random sets of Andy Griffith Show episodes, and I've dreamed of the time when I could collect my all-time favorite show by season.  To my delight, the time is now.  The season one four-disc set consists of four slimline cases in a collection box -- a nice touch.  Each disc contains eight episodes, and there are absolute classics on each disc.  The ""Play All"" feature allows you to view them all at once.  In complete fairness, I wish the set included the pilot featured on ""Make Room for Daddy.""  Additional features/commentaries would be welcomed too.  The chapter marks are a little too far apart for my taste, but that is a minor issue.

The very best part of having the whole first season on clear crisp dvd format is getting to see them uncut.  Some of the best scenes in the show are often cut to fit more commercials in to broadcast syndication.  Scenes at the beginning or end of a show that are not essential to the plot are usually the first to be cut.  These scenes are often the funniest ones in the show when Andy and Barney simply ""take off"" on each other.  It is so good to see the shows as they originally aired on CBS in the sixties.

My only disappointment is that there are no real extras on these dvds.  It would have been nice to get some interviews from the cast or some ""behind the scenes"" stuff or even some commentary

The original shows of the first season, including the epilogues, without any additional features. There has been a lot said about how this set lacks additional features such as interviews and the like, but I for one don't care for them. I don't want to hear conversation about the show, I just want to see the show. The work is more powerful than any anecdote that someone could provide. It might have been good seeing some original commercials but not necessary. If the remaining seasons come out in this format, and I hope they do, I'll be the first in line to buy them.

I believe this to be the finest sit-com that has ever appeared on television and no matter how many episodes I see of Seinfeld I still believe it. I would whole heartily recommend this first season DVD to anyone who is interested in seeing a quality show with honest, believable, complete characters instead of one-sided stereotypes.

Gone are the violated prints that have suffered various forms of butchering over the years.  Fellow ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW lovers know exactly what I mean.  These classics have at various times been sped up to allow for more commercial time; they've also been edited and had their epilogues cut off for the same reason.

Watching Andy play straightman to Barney is priceless, but Andy also has his very funny moments, as do most members of the cast.

2111195,5,B0002NY8PI,"Andy, Barney, Opie, Aunt Bee, Thelma Lou, Otis, Floyd, and the rest of the Mayberry gang have arrived on DVD in style, and with very vivid picture quality, in this first-season boxed set. The 4-Disc set contains all 32 episodes of the rookie season of one of the most beloved programs in television history: ""The Andy Griffith Show"".

Beginning with the pilot episode, ""The New Housekeeper"" (which originally aired on CBS-TV on Monday night, October 3, 1960), ""The Andy Griffith Show"" settled into a comfortable eight-year run, encompassing a total of 249 episodes.

I can just about guarantee this -- The debut season of ""Andy"" has never, ever looked better than on the video we find encoded on these 4 DVDs. Some episodes do have quite a bit of grain ""noise"" dancing around the screen, but overall these black-and-white shows look very sharp and clear. In fact, even during the ""grainier"" programs, the underlying filmed image still looks sharp and undistorted (to my eyes at any rate). My hat is off to whoever was responsible for cleaning up these shows for this DVD release.

An example of the outstanding video quality that I found here --- In several close-up scenes, you can literally read the tiny print on Andy Taylor's sheriff's badge. ""Sheriff -- Mayberry"" can be seen right on his badge in many shots; and the little ""star"" in the middle of the badge is clearly discernible as well. Plus, each individual CRACK in the Mayberry sidewalks can be seen with ease. Stunning quality, especially for a show of this age. The audio sounds excellent as well, via the 2-channel Dolby Mono tracks. And the audio is elevated to a good (decent) level, too. It's not too ""low"". Very nice.

The initial season of this sitcom has always been one of my favorite years during the show's 1960-1968 lifespan. We're introduced to the Taylors in the very funny debut episode, which features an incredibly-cute, 6-year-old Ronny Howard (as Opie Taylor) stealing every scene he's in. Ronny's tearful appeal to his father at the end of the show is hilarious .... ""But, pa, if she [Aunt Bee] leaves, what'll happen to her? She doesn't know how to do anything -- play ball, catch fish, or hunt frogs!  She'll be helpless!!""  :)

Following the pilot episode, many more merry Mayberry escapades from the first season await us.  Such as some of my personal faves: ""A Feud Is A Feud"", ""Stranger In Town"", ""Andy And Opie, Housekeepers"", ""Quiet Sam"", ""The New Doctor"", ""The Manhunt"", ""Opie's Charity"", ""The Inspector"", ""Barney Gets His Man"", ""Bringing Up Opie"", and perhaps the single best (and most touching) Christmas episode ever made for any TV show before or since, entitled simply ""Christmas Story"" -- in which crusty old town curmudgeon Ben Weaver (ideally played by 66-year-old veteran character actor Will Wright) surprises everyone by desperately wanting to be included in the gang's Christmas party at the Courthouse.  That episode demands to be viewed each and every December.

There are no chopped-up, edited episodes here. These programs have been fully restored to their original length, approximately 25-and-a-half minutes each (with some eps. running closer to a full 26 minutes), including the complete ""epilogue"" scenes at the end of each show. These epilogues are rarely included on syndicated prints shown on commercial television.

The original ""whistling"" theme music is also included here during the opening credits. (However, it does sound to me as if the closing credits have been ""dubbed"" (for some reason), using a slightly-different-sounding variation of the theme music; but it's mighty close to the original though.)

The voice-overs at the beginning of the shows are also intact here. Even the original CBS-TV ""opening and closing eye"" logo is included at the end of each of these episodes.

These 32 episodes are arranged on the DVDs in ""Air Date"" order. There are exactly eight episodes on each of the discs.

There are no bonus features included in this set, which is a bit disappointing, but not overly so. Just getting all the full-length episodes from Season One in this kind of jaw-dropping superb quality is the most important thing here, to be sure.

The Packaging ..... This four-disc compilation from Paramount Studios features very nice packaging, including individual ThinPak plastic cases for each of the set's 4 discs. A relatively-strong and substantial outer slipcase box houses the four separate plastic slim cases (which are just half the thickness of a normal keepcase). I very much like this kind of packaging for TV-on-DVD products, where each disc is packed in its own slim plastic case, versus the fold-out ""Digipak"" type of cases. Some of the ""Digipak"" cases practically require a table a mile wide to fully extend the various DVD panels. (Just a wee joke there -- ""Digis"" are OK; but this type of individual-case packaging is much preferred by this writer.)

Each of the slimline cases sports different ""T.A.G.S."" cover art, along with essential episode information located on the inside of the clear, see-through cases (including episode titles, program descriptions, and original air dates). The disc art is equally impressive. When any disc is removed from its tray, a ""Mayberry Fun Fact"" is revealed (printed on the case insert underneath each disc).

There are no separate paper enclosures or inserts. But no such added items are really needed here, since all of the info about the shows is available to view right on the clear cases themselves.

The back side of each of the 4 individual cases displays (in a rather clever fashion) the episode titles of the 8 programs that are included on that disc. These titles are listed on what is meant to represent ""Official Mayberry Courthouse"" stationery -- complete with simulated handwritten memos to Andy and Barney, coffee stains, and dried-on ""drink rings"". A unique ""down home"" kind of a touch here, I think.

I really like this good-looking packaging very much. The color photo used for the front of the outer slipcase, depicting Andy and Opie fishing, captures the homespun feeling and spirit of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" just perfectly.

""The Andy Griffith Show"" has been loved by millions of people for many decades since it first entered American living rooms in the Fall of 1960.  Between its first-run airings and being shown in syndication, it's been said that the show has never been off the air since its inception.  And now, thanks to Paramount's deluxe set of the show's complete first season, it's bound to find even more new fans and gain still more ""air time"", via the DVD format.

Any long-time fan of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" will want a copy of this sparkling DVD set. You'll then be able to see Barney's debut-episode ""jaywalking"" tirade as many times as you please, in full Digital splendor, and in pristine clarity. ...............

""Now why did ya do that, Andy?! You know she was guilty. I seen her do it! Now she's gonna go and tell all her friends how she got away with it, and the next thing you know people are gonna be jaywalking all over the place and disregarding 'keep-off-the-grass' signs and everything!!

The ""trying too hard, Gone-With-the-Wind imitation"" Southern accent is used by all the non-southern actors and actresses. Not that it is bothersome. They just all seem to think that the South has one dialect.

As the seasons go by, you can tell Andy ""refines"" his accent, unfortunately. He should have kept his accent intact. That was part of his charm and wit.",1101772800,,507,4.816091954022989

By the title you may wonder why no 5 stars? Well, this first season, with the thick over-done accents, the absence of Ms. Crump (That's C-R-U-M-P!), and a few shoddy guest stars, takes this down a notch. Don't get me wrong this WILL BE a 5 star show, in fact, this is ONE OF THE all  time 5 star shows, right up there with All in the Family, but not quite yet. Some shows find themselves right away in season one (like All in the Family), others need some retooling (like Seinfeld), Andy just happens to be in second category. I must say though, they really nailed the packaging, truly 5 stars. -Barn.

I'm still in shock that this is out, not so much for Season One (though it DOES have its moments:), but this is a prelude of great things to come... Bring on Barneys First Car!! And for gosh-sakes... take that gun out of your mouth! :)

Note, I've reviewing the FIRST SEASON of Andy Griffith, NOT the entire series with ONE review... if you give every season of every show 5 stars it takes away greatly from the ones that truly DESERVE it!))",1101600000,20,1433,4.355805243445693

2111200,5,B0002NY8PI,"Just viewed disk one and saw scenes I'd never before viewed, no doubt sliced out for 'commercial time'.  It's a true pleasure to visit Mayberry anytime I like.  There's a reason this show has not and will not ever completely depart the Television landscape.  It's a true viewing pleasure rarely found in these jaded days of reality TV and the like.  The performances are flawless, the writing unmatched.  Its truly like spending time with good friends.

My personal favorites of season one are 'Alcohol and Old Lace', 'Quiet Sam', 'Andy forecloses', and 'Christmas Story'.

Although I truly appreciate TVLand's (and TBS before them) loyalty to the show, to be able to view completely uncut episodes is a joy.

Can't wait for season two.  My personal opinion is that season four is the best of all.  Heck, I even enjoy many of the color episodes.... If they decide to release all eight seasons, I'll no doubt own them all.  As Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C was want to say...'Good luck to you and yours...""",1101427200,6,994,4.754385964912281

  No extras, of course -- though frustratingly enough the pilot episode ""Danny Meets Andy Griffith"" from Make Room For Daddy is included on the Danny Thomas box set.  Go figure.  That would be a great extra for the next set, as would the original cast commercials.  (For those that don't know there were ads in the 1st run of the show featuring the cast, in character, extolling the virtues of Grape Nuts, etc).

It doesn't matter that there are no extras, commercials, etc. Us life long fans of the show pretty much know all the extra stuff from books, interviews, articles etc. What matters most is that these are the complete shows in the best uncut quality that we have ever seen and they are our's to enjoy for life. I've probably seen each episode more than a couple dozen times each and this is like seeing them for the first time.

No subtitles, no commentary, no inclusion of the Danny Thomas Show that launched the Andy Griffith character, no discussion or information about the show, no special features, no nothing. This show is a treasure of Americana, and Paramount goes the laziest, greedy route (the V.P.'s at Paramount and Universal home entertainment divisions must continually compete to see who can do the worst job and still turn a buck) and simply slaps their celluloid onto a DVD and send it down to Mexico to get mass reproduced.

We FINALLY get the AGS on quality DVDs from the studio - and they are less than $1 per episode!  Can someone get a clue here?  I guess you'd like to spend $60 just to get some original commercials?  Why nitpick?

""MB"" is right on about the quality.  The picture is so clear and the sound is great!  You can see many things (such as shadows from ceiling mikes) you have never noticed before.  Man, it is so much different than watching on TV reruns or the bargain-bin public domain episode DVDs or VHS tapes.

All of each show is here - minus I guess those commercials.  Who cares?  They are NOT part of the actual show anyway!

Overall I say 5 stars are NOT ENOUGH!  This is a dream come true.  I cannot wait until they release all the B&W years (first 5 seasons).  You can have the color years and characters such as Howard and that new deputy who wouldn't win a talent contest with kindergardener's!  Long live Barney Fife!",1100649600,196,1094,4.358208955223881

2111211,5,B0002NY8PI,"The new DVD release of the Andy Griffith Show looks great!!! Wow!!! Crystal clear, very low noise (only an occasional faint vertical line, very thin and very fast or a small white speck here and there). The picture is so clean and sharp you can see Opie's smallest freckles and Aunt Bee's moles (neck area) and liver spots (hands). In the first three episodes the Mayberry police cruiser looks very used and the paint is badly faded, I never noticed that before but it is clearly evident now. Lots and lots of details that I have never noticed now pop out of the screen. If these aren't the best prints of these shows they have be near the top. I personally haven't seen any other prints that come close, even on TV. All of the original scenes are restored and the fade ins and outs are smooth and silent.

The show's sound is as good or better. Background noise and hiss are nonexistent. The dialog is up front and in your face. I heard birds chirping in the outdoor scenes and at one point in the first or second episode the sound of a plane flying overhead was clearly an unintentional goof. I was at first very disappointed with the opening and ending song tracks. The opening was a little thin and the ending track was definitely different from the one everyone remembers (same song, different version). I thought that they had changed the credit soundtracks for the DVD release. But, by the third episode the opening track was better and the ending track was restored to it's familiar version. I don't know why this is but maybe it's true to the shows original form. I don't know. I was just relieved that the third episode was the right (familiar) version.

During the shows original run the ending credits included pictures of products from the shows sponsors. They do appear in some releases (retail VHS versions in my collection) of the shows. They are not here. To be true to the original (1960's run) format (purist's quibble) they should be included (they are probably removed for copyright/trademark reasons). They may have been superimposed over the ending credits which could mean they were never printed onto the masters. I don't know. It's a very minor point anyway and does not affect the DVD's in any way.

All in all I give it a solid A. The Andy Griffith show has never looked or sounded better.",1100649600,20,2317,4.591787439613527

If it wasn't for Barney this show would have never lasted as long as it did.  I really wish that future editions have extras with the cast. It would add an historical perspective as to why the show is so universally loved.  I think that TV land; the network that currently plays this show, could teach today's executives a thing or two.  We need more positive shows like this one.  Values aren't something to be laughed at.  This show had a moral to each episode.

The picture quality of the episodes is very good. The price is very reasonable. However, a show of this quality deserves a set that includes interviews with the stars and audio commentary with certain episodes. And would it have killed Paramount to include the Danny Thomas episode in which Andy Griffith first appears?!!!

There have been countless specials and reunions over the years that the studio could have included in this set. I can't believe they couldn't get Andy Griffith or Ron Howard to do some commentary.

The release of the Dick Van Dyke show set the standard that all shows should strive for in quality and content. I'm greatful that all the episodes of the Andy Griffith Show are now being released.

On top of that, they say that these will be the complete episodes, despite a lack of frills or any extras, but just getting the show itself as it was first aired is reason enough to buy them.

2111219,5,B0002NY8PI,"I am glad to finally see Andy Griffith released on DVD. I hope they release all 9 seasons eventually. I also want all the Brady Bunch Episodes as well as I Love Lucy on DVD as well. Paramount has the rights to these three.

I do have a couple DVDs of the show. Most of the ones on these low budget discs have the original beginnings but afew do not. All are uncut becasue they all run about 25 minutes. The reason there are so many low budget DVDs available with the same 25 episodes are because they are Public Domain. Paramount renewed copyright for most of the episodes but they did leave about 2 dozen in public domain allowing thse same 20 some episodes to be released time and time again. The Beverly Hillbillies also has about 2 dozen puiblic domain episodes as well. Fortunately all the Public domain epsiodes have Don Knotts which was a positive.

Its nice to see Paramount now releasing entire seasons that now have the copyrighted episodes available. In the first season there are a few public domain episodes but all are in excellent quality. Also these episodes will be uncut as well. I plan on getting a copy when it gets released.

Also for years I noticed in syndication TV stations aired mostly the color episodes of shows like shows like Bewitched, Gilligan, Beverly Hillbillies, Jeannie. They would often skip the black and white episodes. They sometimes would show a black and white episode once for every three times they aired a color episode. Many local stations by the late 70's did not like showing the bl;ack and white episodes. Andy Griffith was an exception and for a while I wondered why. In fact WTBS and other stations showed almost exclusively the black and white episodes. Don Knotts was the main reason. Don was most of the show. When he left the later episodes were not as good. It was also coincidental that at the very first post Don Knotts episode was in color. But color did not help this show.

Still I will get this DVD when it becomes available",1099353600,21,1986,4.539106145251397

Andy's friends Goober(George Lindsey) and Gomer Pyle(Jim Nabors) frequently hung around Andy's police station.

The first season WAS good. The second and thrid were probably the best.

The departure of Barney was a blow to the show but, the decline of the WRITING was what really killed it. The last few seasons were just not very good.

The woman who played Helen is not a good actor and the WRITING for her was just awful. I cannot think of ONE humorouse scene that where she is a contributor. She was not slated to be a regular but, becamse one becuase Andy was so at ease with her(unlike he had been with Ellie and Peg)
