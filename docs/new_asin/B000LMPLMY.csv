8162270,1,B000LMPLMY,1 Star because the DVD has NO SOUND except for the Soundtrack. Their is NO DIALOGUE audible. Unless you can read lips don't bother with it.,1458518400,,139,4.384615384615385
8162271,1,B000LMPLMY,"The quality of the DVD was horrible.  I know it was an old movie, but I have other movies much older with better quality.",1407283200,,121,4.041666666666667
8162272,1,B000LMPLMY,"but unfortunately, it didn't have sound of the actor's speaking. you could hear background sounds and music but not the actor's voices. Amazon replaced it with another, same problem. Amazon said they will have to check their stock, as they all may have bought bad stock from their supplier. They refunded my money, but I was really bummed because this is a very entertaining movie and I've always wanted to own it.",1382918400,,414,4.763888888888889
8162273,5,B000LMPLMY,"A long-awaited appearance on DVD for this late-eighties made-for-tv gem!  Duffy and Manoff are hilarious, touching and compelling all at the same time, not to mention dripping with sex appeal.  Storyline keeps your interest but it's all about the ladies and their crackerjack performances, especially Manoff (who's at her best).  Treat yourself!",1245715200,,345,5.596153846153846
8162274,5,B000LMPLMY,"The movie has violence in it, but it is more on the light side.  Julia Duffy does a part that reminds us of Stephanie in Newhart.  We really enjoyed it.",1233705600,,152,4.033333333333333
8162275,4,B000LMPLMY,I really enjoyed this movie. It's funny to see how the cop and cover girl interact to become better balanced people. It's definitely for fun and campy. A light comedy. I wish that there was a way to obtain this movie.,1226534400,4,217,4.317073170731708
