8577366,5,B00C51RHE4,I truly enjoy Eddie Torres's 2 DVD Set.  I previously owned it but somehow missed placed it over the years.  Having it in a on box set is a major plus.  The lesson's are clear and the performers demonstrating them are very easy to follow.  This is a must have for all Salsa enthusiast.,1403395200,,285,4.222222222222222
8577367,5,B00C51RHE4,"I had the original VHS version long before it came out on DVD, so I feel I am qualified to attest as to how terrific and complete this two disk set is. It makes complex moves seem simple. Each segment is offers a breakdown of both the men's and woman's parts separately, and then they perform each lesson together as partners. And there are a *lot* of segments. Plus, each lesson offers closeups of the dancers foot positions, as well as full body views. Another thing going for this set is that it has percussionist Eddie Montalvo (from the Hector Lavoe orchestra, Fania All Stars etc...) laying down the rhythm. It doesn't get much more authentic than that!  I have seen nearly every available salsa video, and the Eddie Torres production is by far the most thoughtful and well taught.  My dance teacher recommended this video set to her entire salsa class, and she is very highly regarded here in NY.  Don't be fooled by ""reviewers"" who pretend to know salsa  or are most likely  trying to promote their own product. This one, with the clave on ""two"", is the real deal. New York salsa style. I can't rate this one highly enough. Get it, practice, then go out and DANCE! *****Five Stars (Catdancer)",1377043200,2,1200,4.588785046728972
