3053033,3,B0010X5UGU,"My girls like this movie and the only complaint I have about it is in the one song there is a circus theme and it shows a lady that has a rope around her neck and the rope is attached to the ceiling or something and the lade is twirling in circles really fast. Its probably a common circus trick but it looked like a good way to give little children bad ideas. Also, in the song where it was a circus theme, I thought some of the woman could have been more modest. But for the most part I would say this is a cute little movie. It definitely is dated though... it looks like the 90s.",1382140800,4,583,3.9491525423728815
