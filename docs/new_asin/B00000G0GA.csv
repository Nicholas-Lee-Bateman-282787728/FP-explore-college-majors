7908766,5,B00000G0GA,"Have you ever been in a social situation in which everyone isjust as intelligent and intellectual as you? Whether you're a man or awoman, have you ever felt sexually scrutinized by someone so bold and intelligent as to make you feel ill at ease? Think of your wildest sexual fantasy...now think about whether or not you would/could go through with it if the opportunity arose.
Paris-France was written by Tom Walmsley and it is based on his novel. The entire movie is about what happens to four people during Easter weekend. Lucy (played by Leslie Hope) and Michael Quick are a married couple who are in business with William, the three run a small literary company. On the evening of Good Friday William is bringing over Randall Sloan (played by Peter Outerbridge). Sloan, as he prefers to be called, has a manuscript for a book he is writing called ""Under my Skin."" He is an ex-boxer turned writer.
Now, a personal note about this film.  This is one of my top ten favorite films of all time. It is so outrageous, the first time I saw it I was gasping for air long before the end. I first saw it at one of those arthouse cinemas, and as with many of the films I consider extraordinary, a few `men' in the audience couldn't deal with it, got up, and left. When a film can elicit that kind of reaction, I know I'm onto something worth experiencing. This is not a film you can watch while you're cooking or vacuuming the floors. It is laced with subtleties in the tone of the voices, and expressions that you must not miss. It is a study in frustration - sexual frustration. It is a study of some of the strangest fantasies the human psyche can concoct. It is as sexually explicit as you can get without crossing into porno.
The rest of the film will explore everyone's desires and emotions. Michael will wrestle with his homosexuality and the guilt he feels, while Sloan and Lucy explore how frustrating their sexual encounters really are. Also Sloan and William explore their share of sexual frustration. At one point, after having sex, Sloan says to William ""I have found out in the last two years that when a guy is staring at me he's not always looking for trouble. Sometimes it's sex. I find that very bold.  I don't know if could be bold enough to be gay.""
PARIS FRANCE will creep you out, make you uncomfortable, frustrate you, and ultimately show you what awaits you in your path to self-discovery. I'm a better man for having traveled similar roads as the people in this movie. What about you?  END",957657600,38,2506,4.515418502202643
