3171536,4,B0017H3UOS,"If you like light-hearted romantic comedies, this is one to see. The cross-cultural differences in business, family, social, and romantic relationships provide a number of funny moments and an enjoyable story.

Josh Hamilton and Ayesha Dharker find that working together in India to improve productivity in a mediocre call center not only stirs the passions of these 2 stellar producers but also gets the attention of the corporate execs back in the States.

3171537,5,B0017H3UOS,"Funny, sweet and also really cool to see the REAL India on film....without having to take a 20 hour flight.  I'm giving this movie to friends who travel; not sure how I missed it in theaters.  Would certainly like to see more of the beautiful and talented Ms. Dharker.",1222041600,5,268,4.448979591836735
3171538,4,B0017H3UOS,"This is an entertaining, light-hearted, and honest look at India from an American perspective.

I visited India (New Delhi) three times this summer (and counting..) for business projects, and I was able to watch this movie twice during the course of my flights. With each viewing I smiled and laughed at the way the American characters adapted after their first few ""transition"" days in India, and how the Indian characters earnestly tried to make them feel welcome.

As a previous reviewer mentioned, the movie doesn't mention the grittier side of India, such as the huge slum bordering the Mumbai (Bombay) airport, or the muddy, pot-holed, trash-filled streets and sidewalks of every town. However, it does shows the predominantly sweet nature of the Indian people which IMO is one of an India traveler's best rewards.

Aside, if you are planning to travel to India for the first time, take anti-malaria pills with you, a couple rolls of your favorite toilet paper, a phone that works in the 091 country code, and an openness of different cultures. Also, sit in the back seat of your hired car, because the view out the front will be like a widescreen viewing of the craziest ""close-but-no-contact demolition derby"" you've ever seen. Most, but not all, of these points are implied in the movie.

I recommend watching this movie after your trip, you will probably appreciate the movie more than if you watch it before. If you watch it before your trip, make sure you watch it again when you get back!",1220400000,64,1501,4.8515625
3171539,4,B0017H3UOS,"I had the pleasure of watching this movie on one of my flights from California to Bangalore. As an expat who has spent more than a year in India I really enjoyed watching someone else ""suffer"" through India. The film presents the hardships of life for a foreigner in India brilliantly and though it may have left out some of my favorite hardships it still presents many in a fun and humorous way. I highly recommend this to anyone considering a long term stay in India or that has already been through one.",1217116800,3,506,4.451612903225806
3171540,4,B0017H3UOS,"I have just returned from India on a business trip.  My company has recently opened an engineering department in India and I am on a project using 1/2 American and 1/2 Indian engineers.

I saw the movie on a Luthansa flight on the way home.

This was a wonderful presentation on what it means to do business in India!  It's intelligent, well written and entertaining.  And, true!

I heard and saw so much in the movie that was part of my own experience.  The incomplete buildings, the ramshackle wiring, the cultural divice between east and west.

And, let me not forget to mention, the wonderful people of India!  Charming, intelligent, hard working and polite.

See it before you travel!

My only criticism, and not a sharp one, is that no comments were made on the litter and trash on every street or on the thickly polluted air in the big cities.",1215475200,9,850,4.562913907284768
3171541,3,B0017H3UOS,"When an American company outsources the telephone boiler room to
India, it makes for some culture clash.
And an unexpected love affair as well.
The Toad, ah, Todd as a manager innovates new employee
incentives and with the help of a very intelligent
girl begins to meet his company's expected call turn around time.
The Americans on one end of the phone are not totally
happy ordering catalog goods from the Indians with nearly British accents,
so language lessons in American English are necessary.
It is a very good thing for the Indians at a 12 for one
pay ratio, but just plain nasty for all the Americans who lose their jobs?
Somehow making light of it as a romantic comedy seems
a little  insensitive? Some bright Indian will probably get the idea
of cutting out the greedy American company middleman...",1214352000,3,809,4.73758865248227
3171542,5,B0017H3UOS,"This film is not your typical Bollywood although it is set in India.  A sweet and insightful film, it looks at the impact of outsourcing, not just on Americans but others also as we continue our ""race to the bottom"" economically speaking. In addition the ethnic differences are dealt with humorously but make a point about how much we in the U.S. don't understand other cultures and how enriching it can be to open ourselves up.  Throw in a love story (not a chick flick, though), a ""hero"" that is just an ordinary guy, along with the great location - both beautiful and painful to see at times (the conditions of the ""lower"" castes)- and the movie is very compelling.  I just loved it.  Not a ""great"" as in a ""big"" movie, but great in the way that a small, quiet yet powerful film is.",1212451200,43,785,4.393103448275862

3171606,4,B0017H3UOS,"Unlike The Other End of the Line, OUTSOURCED does not take the typical route of a ""border-crossing"" romantic comedy. In fact, it is bigger than a romantic comedy.

Todd Anderson (Josh Hamilton) is an average man who has been in the comfort zone too long. (Comfort being watching or listening from a distance, through the nightly or 24/7 news). He was in need of an upfront reality check that the U.S.A. is not the center of the universe. Puro (Asif Basra) and Asha (Ayesha Dharker) do not hesitate to make that clear, and in a civilized, non-arrogant manner. Plus, they show that we all want big and better in our lives. At the same time, Puro and Asha demonstrate appreciation of the simple things and do not deny that primitive does not mean idiotic or neurotic. Josh shows how easy it is when we listen and look very closely to who and what is near and far from us. From a first-hand point-of-view.

The film could have shown more of Todd's life prior to his journey to and through India, rather than just relying on word of mouth. Same with Asha and Puro's stories. Maybe even add in some the other workers at the call center; expand on their parts.

But all in all OUTSOURCED is recommended for viewers who are done with stereotypes and media defamation. It's not all SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE you know. Neither is any other place outside the States. Plus, the romantic aspect of OUTSOURCED is an added bonus. Not the whole 100%. A good thing too.",1397692800,3,1446,4.553846153846154

3171609,2,B0017H3UOS,"Ashok and Asha are about to consummate their marriage.  They were engaged when she was only four years old, arranged by their parents, and the pending marriage had been the focus of Ashoks life ever since.  He took a less than glamorous job, with the sole intention of supporting who would soon be the love of his life, not a love at first sight as he had seen in more recent Bollywood movies, but a deeper love that would soon develop as they spent their years together.  And he had remained celibate, difficult, as Western culture infiltrates India. As he looked at her, about to give her her first kiss, he sensed that her mind was somewhere else.  Is this the way it should be? he thought.  He had been thinking and dreaming of this moment for years, and yet she did not seem all that excited about it.  As they began to make love, she seemed deftly comfortable with it, practiced, as though she had done this before.  Yet, she did not seem passionate about it.  She appeared to be going through the motions, but her heart wasn't in it.

Are you alright, he asked.  You seem as though something is wrong.

No, she flatly replied.  Im fine.

He, of course, had to accept that at face value.  He had not much experience with women, in that their words alone don't always convey exactly what they mean.  But continuing felt as though performing with an uninspired doll, beautiful to look at but dreadfully inactive.  He stopped and looked at her.  She looked back, but not with the depth of one truly in love, but rather like someone who desperately wanted to be in love, almost as if she was trying but couldn't make it happen.  As she continued to look, a tear fell from here eye, and then another, and then another.

I cant do this, she cried.  She turned onto her belly and began weeping.

Feeling that it was somehow his fault, he began to console her, until the guilt was overwhelming and she needed to unload.  She was in love with another man, an American named Todd, whom she affectionately called Toad.  She had made love to him, twice, as part of her Goan Vacation about which she had planned not to tell a soul.  But she had to tell him.  She could not go through the lovemaking with him when she loved someone else.

Ashok was devastated and furious.  He had waited his entire life for this moment, had saved himself, and had expected the same of her.  After all, her parents had presented her to his parents as a virgin with every intent on staying that way.  Therefore, he had taken not his dream job but one that would provide his wife a comfortable living for the rest of her life.  And so began their marriage.

Wait a minute! you say.  This wasn't part of the movie!  I don't remember these scenes.  Outsourced was a happy romantic comedy that took place when a young manager of a call center has to travel to India to bring a call center up to speed and has to deal with daily life in rural India as he falls in love with one of his employees.  Its cute and funny.

But indeed it was, an essential part of the story.  It was the part of the story you didn't see, but that would surely have taken place as a result of Todd and Ashas dalliance.

Asha did not grow up in modern American society, where premarital sex is so prevalent high school students often learn to perform oral sex prior to learning how to shake hands.  She grew up in culture where girls have their marriages arranged at age four and it is improper for a man and woman to touch each other in public other than a business handshake.  How do we know this?  Asha herself says so.  In such a culture, premarital sex is regarded somewhere between grand larceny and murder.  Sure, that presentation of India is a bit twisted.  We know that men and women in large cities date and have sex before marriage, but Asha is not from that culture.  Again, she says so.  She is from a culture where a man takes a stable job just so he can marry, which is exactly what her work colleague did.

This is what ultimately killed the movie for me.  The overall story itself started out perfect.  An American call center is being outsourced to India and the call center manager has being made to go to India to set up the center there and train the staff.  In doing so, he realizes that things don't work quite the way they do in the US and that presents numerous humorous situation as he takes a train, rides a cab, gets pickpocketed, patronizes a street vendor, and deals with a stray cow that has wandered into his office building.  But as he does so, he also realizes that he must learn about India as well and that success is not merely imposing American ways on India but also understanding Indian ways as well.  It is a predictable but wonderfully positive message to put forth.

Yet, somehow, that was not enough.  It is almost as though the producers decided that they need to shove sex down our throats just to show how hip and un-prude they were, hoping someone would criticize them on it, thus allowing them to choose one of a series of previously canned retorts alluding to Mormonism, Puritanism or Ozzie and Harriet.  And what made it so obvious is how cheesily it was done.  Todd and Asha were stranded on a remote island and the only hotel had only one room available: the Kama Sutra Suite, complete with a heart-shaped bed, which they were forced to share.  I mean, seriously?  After trying for two-thirds of the movie to present a somewhat accurate picture of India, they come up with this?

It is unfortunate that the producers had to do this because the movie could have been really top notch.

3171611,5,B0017H3UOS,"I just looked on Amazon to purchase this movie because I live in an ashram full of Americans who have been to India, and Indian Americans. This is the PERFECT audience for this movie, which I absolutely loved!

My husband and I saw this in the theater in Seattle when it came out, and literally rolled on the floor laughing throughout.  The next day, we dragged some friends, 3 Indian American couples, to go see it again with us again.  They liked it, and laughed a lot, but didn't roll on the floor laughing like we did...

We realized something very important in this.  This movie is absolutely HYSTERICAL for Americans with lots of Indian friends. (Us.) It is second most funny for Indian Americans. (Our friends.)  It might not be funny at all to someone who knows nothing about India or who could care less.

If you live in a major metropolitan area, gather some of your Indian American friends, or if you are Indian American, gather some of your American friends that are familiar with you, and please watch this movie!  You will all enjoy it heartily.

But, I must say, I'm surprised by some of the jaded reviews? And even more surprised that people found those reviews helpful! Don't believe them! This movie is fabulous.  Get it and get it now.  It's hard to believe anyone would think this movie is predictable.  I think it's fresh, original, and did I mention hysterical?

Watch it and enjoy!  If you don't enjoy it, I'm sorry to put it bluntly but you are probably bored with a lot in life including yourself and I feel sorry for you.  Wake up and enjoy the fresh breeze! (or the smelly breeze if you are walking by a garbage pile in India...but hey, that's interesting anyway!)

Either way, this story is about a lonely guy (who has been focused only on his career) find something more to life.  I enjoyed the story and related to his stumbles.

As his understanding grows, his employees grow to like and respect him, including Asha (Ayesha Dharker), a strong, independent woman who quickly puts him in his place...but also wins his heart.

3171659,4,B0017H3UOS,"""Outsourced,"" (2006) is a brisk 103 minutes, a romantic, feelgood PG-13, in full color, of course.  The script was written by, and directed by the young John Jeffcoat, and is a cross-cultural comedy, clearly made by, for, and about the young.  But, for a wonder, this independently-made, tiny budget dramatic comedy is not about young louts, nor a gross-out picture, and, while it's somewhat sentimental, should offend no one.  The picture is set in that youthful West Coast city Seattle, and in an India that's growing exponentially overnight, as more and more jobs are exported there from the Western world.

When his department is sent to India, customer call center manager Todd Anderson (Josh Hamilton -<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Identity-Widescreen-Extended-Edition/dp/B00023B1LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition)</a>) must head to Mumbai to train his successor Purohit N. Virajnarianan (Asif Basra).  Amusing culture clashes ensue as Anderson tries to explain American business practices to his willing, but befuddled new employees, and they try to explain India to him.  The chief explainer-of-India to Anderson proves to be his employee and love interest, Asha, played by the alluring Ayesha Dharker, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-II-Attack-of-the-Clones-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B00006HBUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones (Full Screen Edition)</a>).  Mind you, Dharker is not in the same category of sheer knockout beauty as is Freida Pinto (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slumdog-Millionaire/dp/B001P9KR8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slumdog Millionaire</a>), but she's charming, and easy on the eyes.  However, these actors are all unknown to me, though the Indians may be known in Bollywood cinema, with which I have no familiarity.  Nevertheless they do a nice job.

The scenery, filmed in India, is affectionate, spicy, and eye-opening.  Anderson's call center has supposedly been located in Guaripur, a dusty backwater town in the state of Bihar, in the vicinity of the city of Bombay, now Mumbai  -- the very small town that "" call me Angie,"" Anjali Bose, the heroine of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-New-India/dp/0618646531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss New India</a>, the most recent book by American-Indian author Bharati Mukherjee, is so eager to leave.  Nevertheless, even Angie does mention that call centers-- and jobs - are finally coming to Guaripur, as the bigger cities on the subcontinent are packed out.  And Purohit does mention to Anderson that, as every suitable building, even in Guaripur, is fully occupied, the company has been forced to build a new one.  It's plopped down in the middle of farmland; it looks like an above-ground bunker, and its address is simply ""Fulfilment Centre.""

Moreover, the film clearly pictures that everybody faces problems in life, nonetheless of different kind and magnitude, according to the cultural background and local circumstances. Additionally, I think that it is useful for this review to point out that I live in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), where I am a business consultant at Probatus and I also lecture on ""International Finance"" and ""Strategic Financial Management with Globalisation"" as a part-time Professor at Ibmec-RJ Business School.

3171666,4,B0017H3UOS,"This 2006 lightweight romantic comedy is about a Seattle-based novelty company being outsourced to India and the manager, played by Josh Hamilton, who is charged with the job of training the Indian crew in American ways and in bringing the time of each call down from 12 minutes to 6 minutes.  Along the way, he falls in love with the lovely Asif Basra, one of the call center employees.  Everything about this film is predictable but I did laugh out loud at one of the training sessions for the employees when the manager was trying to teach the Indian employees how to sound more American.

I'm not really into romantic comedies.  The plotline is always predictable.  But sometimes I just don't want to think too much, just relax and let a humorous little story unfold in front of me. The acting was good in this film but the story just a bit too lightweight for me.  However, I must say that I really loved the setting.

""Outsourced"" is a genial and charming fish-out-of-water tale about a young American telemarketer who learns that his job is being shipped overseas. To add insult to injury, the novelty company he works for has decided to send him to India to train his own replacement.  The movie is a bit predictable and unoriginal at times, but only a complete curmudgeon could be totally immune to its spell.

Josh Hamilton is immensely likable as the nice-guy protagonist, and Ayesha Dharker is lovely and radiant as the freethinking co-worker with whom he has a clandestine dalliance.  Indeed, all the actors are first-rate, and the striking settings and iridescent colors add to the movie's appeal.

Moreover, the culture clash aspects of the story are dealt with in droll and subtle terms, as the initially ""superior"" foreigner begins to loosen up and immerse himself in all that this strange and exotic world has to offer.

It's a dicey business trying to make a feel-good comedy out of a subject as controversial and serious as outsourcing, but writer/director John Jeffcoat somehow manages to pull it off.",1294444800,8,1106,5.049450549450549

None of the actors in this film were used in the series, but that is not to imply they are better or worse than those chosen by the network. The story is simple: Todd, an American head of a call center is sent to India to train his replacement. While there, he experiences significant culture shock, but instead of turning into the ""Ugly American"", he come to appreciate many of the finer points of Indian culture. There is also a romantic interest between Todd and Asha, one of his workers. She is smart, attractive, and there is clearly a degree of mutual interest, however she is already engaged to another through an arrangement between her parents and her fiance's parents. The viewer is left wondering how this will be resolved until literally the very last scene, and still it's subject to interpretation.

I felt that that Indian culture was treated in a sensitive manner, although Todd's reaction was sometimes one of confusion. As he gradually loosens up and becomes more comfortable, he begins to fit in better and things go more smoothly. The humor is a little subtle at times.

The brief amount of behind-the-scenes footage makes it clear that the director/co-writer seems to be a rather engaging person himself, and I would bet this was a very pleasant project to work on.

The lead actress in the film is a very cute girl named Ayesha Dharker, and she has a freakishly large and wide smile (This is not meant to be a criticism.) Each time she smiled in the movie I thought to myself that she could have given Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger a run for their ""Joker"" money.

Some arrogance, cultural differences, humor, and romance on the part of the characters. Best of all this film allowed us to explore a different world without constantly including some sterotype. The producers were quite sensitive to this. I found myself liking the three main characters involved.  The film is about an American who works for a company which is outsourcing its customer service division to India.  So, Todd (played by Josh Hamilton) heads out to train the Indian staff how to speak American (i.e learn not to pronounce every letter in the average word and learn not to speak in whole sentences).  While there he learns about the culture of the people he wants to train.  He gets involved in their local festivals and develops feelings for an empployee named Asha.  Asha would inform Todd that he had much to learn about Indian culture.
This was a colorful film with some funny scenes. It was cute how Asha tried to understand the slang that westerners use.  The character played by Josh wanted to learn about the culture also. He stayed at a home with customs he didn't always understand. There is a funny scene involving food also.

3171697,3,B0017H3UOS,"While I enjoyed this film, I have to say that it did not make the most of either its characters, who were mercilessly bland, or the setting. The premise was wonderful: A young marketing executive finds that his entire department has been outsourced to India. In order to keep his job (and his stock options), he needs to fly to India to train his replacement. With this kind of set-up, the opportunity for inter-cultural gags and misunderstandings was enormous.

So, why wasn't this movie funnier, more poignant, more touching, more quirky, more everything? For one thing, the acting was thoroughly uninspired. Although the Indian cast did its best, the Americans sounded bored with their lines. I can't say that I blame them. The lackluster writing contributed quite a bit to the general lack of flavor in this film, but so did the directing. Scenes which might have generated some tension sounded like read-throughs rather than performances. The unrelenting predictability of the plot certainly didn't help. How difficult could it have been to come up with ONE original plot point? The scene in which the young couple was forced to share a pink, heart-shaped bed at the Kamasutra Hotel actually made me groan.

On the bright side, the film was nicely shot. India is a cameraman's paradise. You simply can't get enough of the colors, the activity, the vitality of the place. India, glorious India, was only thing that kept me watching.",1254614400,7,1436,4.954356846473029

The acting is extremely convincing and the casting was excellent. The cinematography is very good and the choreography shines, too. The musical score enhances the film; and this film held my full attention every step of the way.

When the action starts, we meet Todd Anderson (Josh Hamilton) who manages a customer service/order entry call center in Seattle and his boss Dave (Matt Smith). Things start to get complicated real fast when Dave tells Todd that the company is outsourcing all the jobs in their department to a call center in India; and Dave insists that Todd go there to train his successor who will be making much less money than the company ever paid Todd. Todd initially refuses but when Dave intimidates him, Todd goes to India and the story really gets going.

Todd has quite a hard time adjusting to India and its people with their customs; and of course we see that Indians have difficulty understanding American customs, too. Todd also begins working with his successor Purohit N. Virajnarianan (Asif Basra) and he stays at the home of ""Aunti Ji"" (Sudha Shivpuri). Tensions start almost immediately when Aunti Ji questions Todd from the very word go about his love life and how much he makes a year at his job; these are not typical questions when you meet somebody for the first time if you are used to American social norms and mores.

Todd is under quite some pressure to get the call center up and running fast so that he can get back home to Seattle. Todd realizes he has to learn about India in order to get the most out of his employees; and then he cleverly designs an incentive program to motivate the Indian employees to handle their calls faster. Meanwhile, Todd's affection is slowly but surely increasing for Asha (Ayesha Dharker); a beautiful young woman who returns Todd's affections for her.

Look for some excellent scenes throughout this movie that offer us fantastic insights about the Indian way of life and the customs of the Indian people.

In addition, the plot can certainly go anywhere from here. What happens when Dave unexpectedly turns up in India to see for himself just how the call center is doing? Do Todd and Asha enter into a committed relationship? No spoilers here--watch and find out!

In addition, the DVD comes with some nice bonus features. There is a ""behind-the-scenes"" featurette; a discussion with cinematographer Teodoro Maniaci and director John Jeffcoat; another interview with director John Jeffcoat; a music video and more!

Outsourced is a fine motion picture for people who want a view of how people in foreign countries deal with the influx of new jobs that have been outsourced to their country; and the light comedy and romance spice it up a bit as well.

3171702,5,B0017H3UOS,"This was recommended to me by several people who typically hate Indie films, all of whom gushed about how well made it is in terms of writing, pacing, comedy, etc. And I have to agree it's one of the funniest offbeat films I've seen in a long time, managing to keep the pace and making sure that all the setups in the beginning result in a payoff at the end.

The plot revolves around an American call center supervisor whose team gets fired and he gets sent to India to train a group of cheap replacements. This is essentially a cultural comparison movie that helps the main character discover himself, and it shows a side of Indian life that most of us are probably not aware of. There's a cute romantic subplot, and a spattering of local color that reminds me of my trip to Thailand, and will make most viewers want to book the next plane to Mumbai.

The film doesn't dwell on the awkward political issues of outsourcing except to poke fun at everyone involved: the consumers are moaning about outsourcing but refuse to pay higher domestic prices; the Indian workers don't understand why they have to fake American accents and love all the ""tacky"" junk the company sells; and the American managers are bad-tempered, cynical and soulless. It's all presented in the best possible light, and steers clear of stereotyping and obvious gags.

Overall this is a charming little film that would have been a massive hit if it had starred Brad Pitt and been distributed by a major studio. It ranks with Pretty Woman and Four Weddings and A Funeral in terms of knowing which buttons to push, and how to rope the audience along for the ride.

3171703,4,B0017H3UOS,"Okay, it was bound to happen, right? After all the gnashing of teeth about the lost of American jobs to other countries, after all the India-China bashing as the symbol of those loses and after all the strident, if fruitless, lambasting of those facts by every yahoo politician and cretin-like labor bureaucrat we were bound to get out of Hollywood (or Bollywood, for that matter) a comedic take on this phenomenon. And, given the political ethos of these times, a little `lesson' in multi-culturalism to boot.

It may be unfair to lay the vagaries of the world labor market and the current phase of capitalist ""globalization"" on a simple film, and I won't, at least not much because this was actually an entertaining film on its own terms, but its subtext (nice weasel word, right?) does fit in rather nicely about the state of the still fervent ""outsourcing"" strategy that virtually every large corporation in America (and elsewhere) has hit upon in order tot reduce (and reduce significantly) their wage bills, particularly administrative costs and the price of unskilled and semi-skilled labor.

A quick sketch of the plot is in order. An American telemarketing corporation in order to cut those high administrative costs fires it's American-centered order-taking staff and out sources to the highly skilled but cheap wage Indian labor market. A middle level executive, the star of the film, Josh Hamilton, is called upon to bring the Indians up to speed and the twists and turns of the plot turn around the struggle to get the Indians to conform to the Taylor productivity speed up system well-known in American business circles. The faults and follies of this transformation drive the, sometimes understated, comedy of the film. Along the way, naturally, said executive gets an up close and personal lesson in multiculturalism from a very fetching Indian love interest.

But here is the point for our purposes-in the end, and I am really giving nothing away here, the Indian employees in their turn are fired so that the corporation can set up shop in the even cheaper Chinese labor market. In short, the race to the bottom continues on its merry way unabated. It is that unabated condition that I will finish up with. I've mentioned those cretin-like labor bureaucrats above who have ""belly-ached"" about the flight of jobs to other countries without lifting finger one to organize labor internationally to drive wages up and make the flight of jobs out much less attractive . Hell, they haven't, at least since the great wave of industrial unionism led by the CIO drives of the 1930's, done anything to organize labor in the cheap-labor American south or, and here is the real crime, Wal-mart. This is hardly the end of the discussion. Let's leave it at this for now- organize globally and think locally.

At first Todd is overwhelmed and a bit put off by Indian culture. But he eventually learns to embrace the differences and, by doing so, increase productivity.

This is not a great movie by any means. Cliches abound and certain aspects of the story seem highly unlikely. But it does have it's charms and I think anyone who has spent time in India will be able to relate to what Todd goes through with ""cultural shock"".

To me the smart and beautiful Asha (Ayesha Dharker) was the highlight of the movie. I can definitely see why Todd would fall for her. But what made her risk cultural humiliation for a guy like him I'm not really sure. Still this film is able to effectively make the point that ""Asha can do anything"" and if this helps to provide confidence and inspiration to women in India and elsewhere then I would say this movie has been a success.",1245801600,,989,4.458563535911602

So where does it fall? Somewhere in the almost tepid middle. Its lighthearted, whimsical, touching and dumbed down. Don't get me wrong though- the last one may even be a good thing- many people feel alienated by the kinetic swirl of outlandish colors and images that call India home, and this hand held foray into the madness is just gentle enough.
So watch it, but try to refrain from drawing on it to define your impressions of my country :)

PROS:
+ Good soundtrack- yes, you can get a little 'Slumdog Millionaire' fix here
+ Adorable (albeit slightly forgettable) characters
+ Happy- resuscitate yourself from that bummed out depression. Its basically the movie version of Paul Evan's 'Happy Go Lucky Me'
+ Gives character and idiosyncrasy to that 'Andrew' or 'Larry' you just spoke to from the 800 number

CONS:
- Not every Indian is as sweet, or bumpkinny, or traditional as the characters in the movie, so hold on to that pinch of salt
- A rather predictable storyline

This is a funny film while also being sweet and charming, but not overly so.  It's a typical fish out of water tale, but with a nice modern twist.  Take a customer service manager that is comfortable with his existence in a call center in the United States and force him to go run the companies new call center that has been Outsourced to India.  Seems simple enough, take a few days, go check out the center and make the required improvements and then climb on the plane and go back home.  If only it was that simple.

U.S. citizens tend to think of the world revolving around them and the United States, but that is far from the truth.  If you've seen any episodes of the reality TV series Amazing Race you may have learned a bit about the rest of the world and also may have learned about how bad U.S. citizens can behave while visiting the rest of the world.  Many times we (U.S. citizens) assume that the rest of the world should automatically understand and speak U.S. English.  We also assume that the U.S. dollar should be good everywhere, and that we can find our choices of food items everywhere we go.  Such is really not the case, as is evidenced by the realism that shines through this film with comedic flare.

This is a great film to watch whether or not you ever had the priviledge of traveling outside the U.S. or not. If you are lucky, you might have friends and co-workers that are immigrants.  I have had just that experience, with a former co-worker that is from India.  Having seen this film streamed from the by-mail/internet disc rental company on my gaming console with the green X on the controller, I was very happy to be able to show them that co-worker and her family the movie while visiting one afternoon.  She and her husband (also from India) both thoroughly enjoyed telling myself and my family about how realistic things were in the film.

I would dearly love to have this film on Blu-ray or the now defunct HD DVD format.  It's a very good film, and for some it might even hit the status of great.  It is certainly well worth viewing, and would be a definite buy on Blu-ray (if it was available) if that was possible.  On DVD, well, I'm holding out for now in the hopes it eventually comes out on Blu-ray, but at the right price it would be a nice addition to anyone's collection.",1230595200,6,2689,4.344

Look, I get that this is supposed to be a lighthearted romantic comedy but it was utterly predictable and dull, with a cliched ""fish out of water"" plot right out of Scriptwriting 101.  Sample scene: man tells his boss there is no way he is traveling to India.  Want to guess what the next scene will be?  The whole film is like this, moving from one predictable plot point to another with obvious jokes so blunt that they could be punctuated with a rimshot on the soundtrack.  Josh Hamilton in the lead role doesn't help much as he is too bland to conjure any believable chemistry with Asif Basra.

The story is delightful and paints the working population of India as practical, competitive, polite and hard working. It also pulls no punches about the many problems of India.  The opening scenes are charming showing an American businessman traveling through India to his new assignment and his encounters with colorful local people.

One scene which typifies the film illustrates his travels on a crowded Indian train where a small boy offers him his seat. Then, as if it were the most natural thing, the boy climbs into his lap and resumes his fidgeting. A little later when the businessman offers another small boy some money as charity the child hugs the man out of gratitude.

Initially angry he finds in India both love and appreciation for the good things at home in the USA that he had neglected for years. India is grimy, poor and incredibly lively.

Shot on location in India and the USA this is a movie of contrasts from a land where people have so much money that they can spend it on the junk that is sold from the Indian call centre to a country where people are so poor that they quite literally wash and live on the streets.  I enjoyed this movie - it doesn't try to whitewash the grimy portions of India, but it also shows you the warmth of the people which in my experience rings true.

I visited India (New Delhi) three times this summer (and counting..) for business projects, and I was able to watch this movie twice during the course of my flights. With each viewing I smiled and laughed at the way the American characters adapted after their first few ""transition"" days in India, and how the Indian characters earnestly tried to make them feel welcome.

As a previous reviewer mentioned, the movie doesn't mention the grittier side of India, such as the huge slum bordering the Mumbai (Bombay) airport, or the muddy, pot-holed, trash-filled streets and sidewalks of every town. However, it does shows the predominantly sweet nature of the Indian people which IMO is one of an India traveler's best rewards.

Aside, if you are planning to travel to India for the first time, take anti-malaria pills with you, a couple rolls of your favorite toilet paper, a phone that works in the 091 country code, and an openness of different cultures. Also, sit in the back seat of your hired car, because the view out the front will be like a widescreen viewing of the craziest ""close-but-no-contact demolition derby"" you've ever seen. Most, but not all, of these points are implied in the movie.

3406103,4,B0017H3UOS,"Unlike The Other End of the Line, OUTSOURCED does not take the typical route of a ""border-crossing"" romantic comedy. In fact, it is bigger than a romantic comedy.

Todd Anderson (Josh Hamilton) is an average man who has been in the comfort zone too long. (Comfort being watching or listening from a distance, through the nightly or 24/7 news). He was in need of an upfront reality check that the U.S.A. is not the center of the universe. Puro (Asif Basra) and Asha (Ayesha Dharker) do not hesitate to make that clear, and in a civilized, non-arrogant manner. Plus, they show that we all want big and better in our lives. At the same time, Puro and Asha demonstrate appreciation of the simple things and do not deny that primitive does not mean idiotic or neurotic. Josh shows how easy it is when we listen and look very closely to who and what is near and far from us. From a first-hand point-of-view.

The film could have shown more of Todd's life prior to his journey to and through India, rather than just relying on word of mouth. Same with Asha and Puro's stories. Maybe even add in some the other workers at the call center; expand on their parts.

But all in all OUTSOURCED is recommended for viewers who are done with stereotypes and media defamation. It's not all SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE you know. Neither is any other place outside the States. Plus, the romantic aspect of OUTSOURCED is an added bonus. Not the whole 100%. A good thing too.",1397692800,3,1446,4.553846153846154

3406106,2,B0017H3UOS,"Ashok and Asha are about to consummate their marriage.  They were engaged when she was only four years old, arranged by their parents, and the pending marriage had been the focus of Ashoks life ever since.  He took a less than glamorous job, with the sole intention of supporting who would soon be the love of his life, not a love at first sight as he had seen in more recent Bollywood movies, but a deeper love that would soon develop as they spent their years together.  And he had remained celibate, difficult, as Western culture infiltrates India. As he looked at her, about to give her her first kiss, he sensed that her mind was somewhere else.  Is this the way it should be? he thought.  He had been thinking and dreaming of this moment for years, and yet she did not seem all that excited about it.  As they began to make love, she seemed deftly comfortable with it, practiced, as though she had done this before.  Yet, she did not seem passionate about it.  She appeared to be going through the motions, but her heart wasn't in it.

Are you alright, he asked.  You seem as though something is wrong.

No, she flatly replied.  Im fine.

He, of course, had to accept that at face value.  He had not much experience with women, in that their words alone don't always convey exactly what they mean.  But continuing felt as though performing with an uninspired doll, beautiful to look at but dreadfully inactive.  He stopped and looked at her.  She looked back, but not with the depth of one truly in love, but rather like someone who desperately wanted to be in love, almost as if she was trying but couldn't make it happen.  As she continued to look, a tear fell from here eye, and then another, and then another.

I cant do this, she cried.  She turned onto her belly and began weeping.

Feeling that it was somehow his fault, he began to console her, until the guilt was overwhelming and she needed to unload.  She was in love with another man, an American named Todd, whom she affectionately called Toad.  She had made love to him, twice, as part of her Goan Vacation about which she had planned not to tell a soul.  But she had to tell him.  She could not go through the lovemaking with him when she loved someone else.

Ashok was devastated and furious.  He had waited his entire life for this moment, had saved himself, and had expected the same of her.  After all, her parents had presented her to his parents as a virgin with every intent on staying that way.  Therefore, he had taken not his dream job but one that would provide his wife a comfortable living for the rest of her life.  And so began their marriage.

Wait a minute! you say.  This wasn't part of the movie!  I don't remember these scenes.  Outsourced was a happy romantic comedy that took place when a young manager of a call center has to travel to India to bring a call center up to speed and has to deal with daily life in rural India as he falls in love with one of his employees.  Its cute and funny.

But indeed it was, an essential part of the story.  It was the part of the story you didn't see, but that would surely have taken place as a result of Todd and Ashas dalliance.

Asha did not grow up in modern American society, where premarital sex is so prevalent high school students often learn to perform oral sex prior to learning how to shake hands.  She grew up in culture where girls have their marriages arranged at age four and it is improper for a man and woman to touch each other in public other than a business handshake.  How do we know this?  Asha herself says so.  In such a culture, premarital sex is regarded somewhere between grand larceny and murder.  Sure, that presentation of India is a bit twisted.  We know that men and women in large cities date and have sex before marriage, but Asha is not from that culture.  Again, she says so.  She is from a culture where a man takes a stable job just so he can marry, which is exactly what her work colleague did.

This is what ultimately killed the movie for me.  The overall story itself started out perfect.  An American call center is being outsourced to India and the call center manager has being made to go to India to set up the center there and train the staff.  In doing so, he realizes that things don't work quite the way they do in the US and that presents numerous humorous situation as he takes a train, rides a cab, gets pickpocketed, patronizes a street vendor, and deals with a stray cow that has wandered into his office building.  But as he does so, he also realizes that he must learn about India as well and that success is not merely imposing American ways on India but also understanding Indian ways as well.  It is a predictable but wonderfully positive message to put forth.

Yet, somehow, that was not enough.  It is almost as though the producers decided that they need to shove sex down our throats just to show how hip and un-prude they were, hoping someone would criticize them on it, thus allowing them to choose one of a series of previously canned retorts alluding to Mormonism, Puritanism or Ozzie and Harriet.  And what made it so obvious is how cheesily it was done.  Todd and Asha were stranded on a remote island and the only hotel had only one room available: the Kama Sutra Suite, complete with a heart-shaped bed, which they were forced to share.  I mean, seriously?  After trying for two-thirds of the movie to present a somewhat accurate picture of India, they come up with this?

It is unfortunate that the producers had to do this because the movie could have been really top notch.  The concept was funny, the characters were likable, cinematography was pleasant and interesting, and many of the episodes were humorous as well as touching.  But instead, it just felt unclean after having seen it, as though I was part of an effort to corrupt a culture that a lot of people consider truly sacred.",1395446400,,5895,4.417827298050139

3406108,5,B0017H3UOS,"I just looked on Amazon to purchase this movie because I live in an ashram full of Americans who have been to India, and Indian Americans. This is the PERFECT audience for this movie, which I absolutely loved!

My husband and I saw this in the theater in Seattle when it came out, and literally rolled on the floor laughing throughout.  The next day, we dragged some friends, 3 Indian American couples, to go see it again with us again.  They liked it, and laughed a lot, but didn't roll on the floor laughing like we did...

We realized something very important in this.  This movie is absolutely HYSTERICAL for Americans with lots of Indian friends. (Us.) It is second most funny for Indian Americans. (Our friends.)  It might not be funny at all to someone who knows nothing about India or who could care less.

If you live in a major metropolitan area, gather some of your Indian American friends, or if you are Indian American, gather some of your American friends that are familiar with you, and please watch this movie!  You will all enjoy it heartily.

But, I must say, I'm surprised by some of the jaded reviews? And even more surprised that people found those reviews helpful! Don't believe them! This movie is fabulous.  Get it and get it now.  It's hard to believe anyone would think this movie is predictable.  I think it's fresh, original, and did I mention hysterical?

Watch it and enjoy!  If you don't enjoy it, I'm sorry to put it bluntly but you are probably bored with a lot in life including yourself and I feel sorry for you.  Wake up and enjoy the fresh breeze! (or the smelly breeze if you are walking by a garbage pile in India...but hey, that's interesting anyway!)

If you've never been to India, you'll be able to get a taste of the country (though I don't think they quite captured the truly zany and frightening traffic of the country).  You either laugh hysterically as Todd, an obviously unseasoned traveler, makes many cultural mistakes or you'll emphasize and learn with him.  Either way, this story is about a lonely guy (who has been focused only on his career) find something more to life.  I enjoyed the story and related to his stumbles.

From a bad choice of food right off the plane to trying to run a business like Americans do in a country halfway around the world, Todd feels lost.

As his understanding grows, his employees grow to like and respect him, including Asha (Ayesha Dharker), a strong, independent woman who quickly puts him in his place...but also wins his heart. Through many twists and turns and less-traveled paths, Todd discovers himself in a place he never thought he would, half a world away from the life he thought he wanted.

The script was written by, and directed by the young John Jeffcoat, and is a cross-cultural comedy, clearly made by, for, and about the young.  But, for a wonder, this independently-made, tiny budget dramatic comedy is not about young louts, nor a gross-out picture, and, while it's somewhat sentimental, should offend no one.  The picture is set in that youthful West Coast city Seattle, and in an India that's growing exponentially overnight, as more and more jobs are exported there from the Western world.

When his department is sent to India, customer call center manager Todd Anderson (Josh Hamilton -<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Identity-Widescreen-Extended-Edition/dp/B00023B1LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Identity (Widescreen Extended Edition)</a>) must head to Mumbai to train his successor Purohit N. Virajnarianan (Asif Basra).  Amusing culture clashes ensue as Anderson tries to explain American business practices to his willing, but befuddled new employees, and they try to explain India to him.  The chief explainer-of-India to Anderson proves to be his employee and love interest, Asha, played by the alluring Ayesha Dharker, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-II-Attack-of-the-Clones-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B00006HBUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones (Full Screen Edition)</a>).  Mind you, Dharker is not in the same category of sheer knockout beauty as is Freida Pinto (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slumdog-Millionaire/dp/B001P9KR8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slumdog Millionaire</a>), but she's charming, and easy on the eyes.  However, these actors are all unknown to me, though the Indians may be known in Bollywood cinema, with which I have no familiarity.  Nevertheless they do a nice job.

The scenery, filmed in India, is affectionate, spicy, and eye-opening.  Anderson's call center has supposedly been located in Guaripur, a dusty backwater town in the state of Bihar, in the vicinity of the city of Bombay, now Mumbai  -- the very small town that "" call me Angie,"" Anjali Bose, the heroine of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-New-India/dp/0618646531/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss New India</a>, the most recent book by American-Indian author Bharati Mukherjee, is so eager to leave.  Nevertheless, even Angie does mention that call centers-- and jobs - are finally coming to Guaripur, as the bigger cities on the subcontinent are packed out.  And Purohit does mention to Anderson that, as every suitable building, even in Guaripur, is fully occupied, the company has been forced to build a new one.  It's plopped down in the middle of farmland; it looks like an above-ground bunker, and its address is simply ""Fulfilment Centre.""

Along the way, he falls in love with the lovely Asif Basra, one of the call center employees.

""Outsourced"" is a genial and charming fish-out-of-water tale about a young American telemarketer who learns that his job is being shipped overseas. To add insult to injury, the novelty company he works for has decided to send him to India to train his own replacement.  The movie is a bit predictable and unoriginal at times, but only a complete curmudgeon could be totally immune to its spell.

Josh Hamilton is immensely likable as the nice-guy protagonist, and Ayesha Dharker is lovely and radiant as the freethinking co-worker with whom he has a clandestine dalliance.  Indeed, all the actors are first-rate, and the striking settings and iridescent colors add to the movie's appeal.

Moreover, the culture clash aspects of the story are dealt with in droll and subtle terms, as the initially ""superior"" foreigner begins to loosen up and immerse himself in all that this strange and exotic world has to offer.

It's a dicey business trying to make a feel-good comedy out of a subject as controversial and serious as outsourcing, but writer/director John Jeffcoat somehow manages to pull it off.",1294444800,8,1106,5.049450549450549

The story is simple: Todd, an American head of a call center is sent to India to train his replacement. While there, he experiences significant culture shock, but instead of turning into the ""Ugly American"", he come to appreciate many of the finer points of Indian culture. There is also a romantic interest between Todd and Asha, one of his workers. She is smart, attractive, and there is clearly a degree of mutual interest, however she is already engaged to another through an arrangement between her parents and her fiance's parents. The viewer is left wondering how this will be resolved until literally the very last scene, and still it's subject to interpretation.

I felt that that Indian culture was treated in a sensitive manner, although Todd's reaction was sometimes one of confusion. As he gradually loosens up and becomes more comfortable, he begins to fit in better and things go more smoothly. The humor is a little subtle at times.

The brief amount of behind-the-scenes footage makes it clear that the director/co-writer seems to be a rather engaging person himself, and I would bet this was a very pleasant project to work on.

The lead actress in the film is a very cute girl named Ayesha Dharker, and she has a freakishly large and wide smile (This is not meant to be a criticism.) Each time she smiled in the movie I thought to myself that she could have given Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger a run for their ""Joker"" money.

""Outsourced"" starts a bit slowly, but the setup of the characters and the culture makes for a rewarding, memorable, and slightly sappy second half.

Convincing acting and excellent filming. Very enjoyable. Left me with an altered viewpoint of global corporate business and foreign culture.

The soundtrack was well done. Really sets the feel of the movie. Some of the instrumental tracks are quite haunting and moving.

Two thumbs way up for this movie.

He faces the inevitable culture shock of adjusting to a shockingly poor and over-crowded country, but gradually finds good friends among his co-workers.

The movie may be completely predictable, but it is also entirely enjoyable thanks to an engaging cast and a good script.  Hamilton makes a likeable, unassuming fish-out-of-water.  Filmed on location in India, one feels Todd's confusion and frustration with the strangeness of his surroundings, which makes the friendships he makes even sweeter.

Some arrogance, cultural differences, humor, and romance on the part of the characters. Best of all this film allowed us to explore a different world without constantly including some sterotype. The producers were quite sensitive to this. I found myself liking the three main characters involved.  The film is about an American who works for a company which is outsourcing its customer service division to India.  So, Todd (played by Josh Hamilton) heads out to train the Indian staff how to speak American (i.e learn not to pronounce every letter in the average word and learn not to speak in whole sentences).  While there he learns about the culture of the people he wants to train.  He gets involved in their local festivals and develops feelings for an empployee named Asha.  Asha would inform Todd that he had much to learn about Indian culture.
This was a colorful film with some funny scenes. It was cute how Asha tried to understand the slang that westerners use.  The character played by Josh wanted to learn about the culture also. He stayed at a home with customs he didn't always understand. There is a funny scene involving food also.  At the end, I saw how most of us who complain about outsourcing really don't do much to support local industries.  The film ended a postive but surprising note.

But if instead it's one of those days for a warm, funny, feel-good film, then ""Outsourced"" fills the bill. For that reason, I would say it makes a good ""starter"" film for Americans completely ignorant of India other than being annoyed by call center interactions or riled by the reports of job loss (which is therefore most of us).

3406194,3,B0017H3UOS,"While I enjoyed this film, I have to say that it did not make the most of either its characters, who were mercilessly bland, or the setting. The premise was wonderful: A young marketing executive finds that his entire department has been outsourced to India. In order to keep his job (and his stock options), he needs to fly to India to train his replacement. With this kind of set-up, the opportunity for inter-cultural gags and misunderstandings was enormous.

So, why wasn't this movie funnier, more poignant, more touching, more quirky, more everything? For one thing, the acting was thoroughly uninspired. Although the Indian cast did its best, the Americans sounded bored with their lines. I can't say that I blame them. The lackluster writing contributed quite a bit to the general lack of flavor in this film, but so did the directing. Scenes which might have generated some tension sounded like read-throughs rather than performances. The unrelenting predictability of the plot certainly didn't help. How difficult could it have been to come up with ONE original plot point? The scene in which the young couple was forced to share a pink, heart-shaped bed at the Kamasutra Hotel actually made me groan.

On the bright side, the film was nicely shot. India is a cameraman's paradise. You simply can't get enough of the colors, the activity, the vitality of the place. India, glorious India, was only thing that kept me watching.",1254614400,7,1436,4.954356846473029

3406196,5,B0017H3UOS,"Outsourced is a very entertaining film with comedy, a bit of drama and a healthy side dish of romance that avoids being syrupy sweet. The acting is extremely convincing and the casting was excellent. The cinematography is very good and the choreography shines, too. The musical score enhances the film; and this film held my full attention every step of the way.

When the action starts, we meet Todd Anderson (Josh Hamilton) who manages a customer service/order entry call center in Seattle and his boss Dave (Matt Smith). Things start to get complicated real fast when Dave tells Todd that the company is outsourcing all the jobs in their department to a call center in India; and Dave insists that Todd go there to train his successor who will be making much less money than the company ever paid Todd. Todd initially refuses but when Dave intimidates him, Todd goes to India and the story really gets going.

Todd has quite a hard time adjusting to India and its people with their customs; and of course we see that Indians have difficulty understanding American customs, too. Todd also begins working with his successor Purohit N. Virajnarianan (Asif Basra) and he stays at the home of ""Aunti Ji"" (Sudha Shivpuri). Tensions start almost immediately when Aunti Ji questions Todd from the very word go about his love life and how much he makes a year at his job; these are not typical questions when you meet somebody for the first time if you are used to American social norms and mores.

Todd is under quite some pressure to get the call center up and running fast so that he can get back home to Seattle. Todd realizes he has to learn about India in order to get the most out of his employees; and then he cleverly designs an incentive program to motivate the Indian employees to handle their calls faster. Meanwhile, Todd's affection is slowly but surely increasing for Asha (Ayesha Dharker); a beautiful young woman who returns Todd's affections for her.

Look for some excellent scenes throughout this movie that offer us fantastic insights about the Indian way of life and the customs of the Indian people.

In addition, the plot can certainly go anywhere from here. What happens when Dave unexpectedly turns up in India to see for himself just how the call center is doing? Do Todd and Asha enter into a committed relationship? No spoilers here--watch and find out!

In addition, the DVD comes with some nice bonus features. There is a ""behind-the-scenes"" featurette; a discussion with cinematographer Teodoro Maniaci and director John Jeffcoat; another interview with director John Jeffcoat; a music video and more!

Outsourced is a fine motion picture for people who want a view of how people in foreign countries deal with the influx of new jobs that have been outsourced to their country; and the light comedy and romance spice it up a bit as well.

3406199,5,B0017H3UOS,"This was recommended to me by several people who typically hate Indie films, all of whom gushed about how well made it is in terms of writing, pacing, comedy, etc. And I have to agree it's one of the funniest offbeat films I've seen in a long time, managing to keep the pace and making sure that all the setups in the beginning result in a payoff at the end.

The plot revolves around an American call center supervisor whose team gets fired and he gets sent to India to train a group of cheap replacements. This is essentially a cultural comparison movie that helps the main character discover himself, and it shows a side of Indian life that most of us are probably not aware of. There's a cute romantic subplot, and a spattering of local color that reminds me of my trip to Thailand, and will make most viewers want to book the next plane to Mumbai.

The film doesn't dwell on the awkward political issues of outsourcing except to poke fun at everyone involved: the consumers are moaning about outsourcing but refuse to pay higher domestic prices; the Indian workers don't understand why they have to fake American accents and love all the ""tacky"" junk the company sells; and the American managers are bad-tempered, cynical and soulless. It's all presented in the best possible light, and steers clear of stereotyping and obvious gags.

Overall this is a charming little film that would have been a massive hit if it had starred Brad Pitt and been distributed by a major studio. It ranks with Pretty Woman and Four Weddings and A Funeral in terms of knowing which buttons to push, and how to rope the audience along for the ride.

3406200,4,B0017H3UOS,"Okay, it was bound to happen, right? After all the gnashing of teeth about the lost of American jobs to other countries, after all the India-China bashing as the symbol of those loses and after all the strident, if fruitless, lambasting of those facts by every yahoo politician and cretin-like labor bureaucrat we were bound to get out of Hollywood (or Bollywood, for that matter) a comedic take on this phenomenon. And, given the political ethos of these times, a little `lesson' in multi-culturalism to boot.

It may be unfair to lay the vagaries of the world labor market and the current phase of capitalist ""globalization"" on a simple film, and I won't, at least not much because this was actually an entertaining film on its own terms, but its subtext (nice weasel word, right?) does fit in rather nicely about the state of the still fervent ""outsourcing"" strategy that virtually every large corporation in America (and elsewhere) has hit upon in order tot reduce (and reduce significantly) their wage bills, particularly administrative costs and the price of unskilled and semi-skilled labor.

A quick sketch of the plot is in order. An American telemarketing corporation in order to cut those high administrative costs fires it's American-centered order-taking staff and out sources to the highly skilled but cheap wage Indian labor market. A middle level executive, the star of the film, Josh Hamilton, is called upon to bring the Indians up to speed and the twists and turns of the plot turn around the struggle to get the Indians to conform to the Taylor productivity speed up system well-known in American business circles. The faults and follies of this transformation drive the, sometimes understated, comedy of the film. Along the way, naturally, said executive gets an up close and personal lesson in multiculturalism from a very fetching Indian love interest.

But here is the point for our purposes-in the end, and I am really giving nothing away here, the Indian employees in their turn are fired so that the corporation can set up shop in the even cheaper Chinese labor market. In short, the race to the bottom continues on its merry way unabated. It is that unabated condition that I will finish up with. I've mentioned those cretin-like labor bureaucrats above who have ""belly-ached"" about the flight of jobs to other countries without lifting finger one to organize labor internationally to drive wages up and make the flight of jobs out much less attractive . Hell, they haven't, at least since the great wave of industrial unionism led by the CIO drives of the 1930's, done anything to organize labor in the cheap-labor American south or, and here is the real crime, Wal-mart. This is hardly the end of the discussion. Let's leave it at this for now- organize globally and think locally.

To me the smart and beautiful Asha (Ayesha Dharker) was the highlight of the movie. I can definitely see why Todd would fall for her. But what made her risk cultural humiliation for a guy like him I'm not really sure.

So where does it fall? Somewhere in the almost tepid middle. Its lighthearted, whimsical, touching and dumbed down. Don't get me wrong though- the last one may even be a good thing- many people feel alienated by the kinetic swirl of outlandish colors and images that call India home, and this hand held foray into the madness is just gentle enough.

PROS:
+ Good soundtrack- yes, you can get a little 'Slumdog Millionaire' fix here
+ Adorable (albeit slightly forgettable) characters
+ Happy- resuscitate yourself from that bummed out depression. Its basically the movie version of Paul Evan's 'Happy Go Lucky Me'
+ Gives character and idiosyncrasy to that 'Andrew' or 'Larry' you just spoke to from the 800 number

The movie was fun and entertaining. I liked it a lot, and I guess one of the reasons why I liked it was that I actually visited Mumbai before and kind of related to the movie. I was watching it on the airplane and had quite good laughs.",1234396800,2,573,4.209090909090909
3406226,5,B0017H3UOS,"It's rare to find a film that feels as real as this one. The story is as predictable as life is.  Cliches, by definition, lack imagination and heart, and this film has both in spades. Excellent film for discussions of multiculturalism, globalism, and what it means to be human these days.",1233446400,9,288,4.647058823529412
3406227,4,B0017H3UOS,There are quite a few reviews up on this one. I just want to add weight and say this is a little charmer of a movie that makes you feel good about India and the call centres. I know 2 other families that have seen this DVD who also rated it around where I did.,1233100800,,260,3.7454545454545456
3406228,5,B0017H3UOS,"For anyone who's travelled abroad and experienced other cultures or have worked with Indians, this movie is for you!  This cross-culture comedy is eye-opening and hilarious.  Excellent independent film that beats most of the dribble that comes out of Hollywood these days.",1232755200,2,272,5.4523809523809526
3406229,4,B0017H3UOS,"I'm really glad this finally came out on DVD.  No big American stars in it, and none needed.  A delightful and gentle comedy playing on the theme of a stranger in a strange land.  It's one of those movies that you don't want to end.  And Ayesha Dharker is ravishing !",1230768000,6,267,4.176470588235294
3406230,4,B0017H3UOS,"A few others have said that this is a charming and/or delightful film, and I really don't want to use the same words, but being a bit short on a theasarus at the moment (yeah, yeah, I could fire up the word processor, use the theasarus function there, etc., but why do that when I'd rather have a nice Hindi word to use instead? ;-) ) I think I'll stick with those words.

This is a funny film while also being sweet and charming, but not overly so.  It's a typical fish out of water tale, but with a nice modern twist.  Take a customer service manager that is comfortable with his existence in a call center in the United States and force him to go run the companies new call center that has been Outsourced to India.  Seems simple enough, take a few days, go check out the center and make the required improvements and then climb on the plane and go back home.  If only it was that simple.

U.S. citizens tend to think of the world revolving around them and the United States, but that is far from the truth.  If you've seen any episodes of the reality TV series Amazing Race you may have learned a bit about the rest of the world and also may have learned about how bad U.S. citizens can behave while visiting the rest of the world.  Many times we (U.S. citizens) assume that the rest of the world should automatically understand and speak U.S. English.  We also assume that the U.S. dollar should be good everywhere, and that we can find our choices of food items everywhere we go.  Such is really not the case, as is evidenced by the realism that shines through this film with comedic flare.

This is a great film to watch whether or not you ever had the priviledge of traveling outside the U.S. or not. If you are lucky, you might have friends and co-workers that are immigrants.  I have had just that experience, with a former co-worker that is from India.  Having seen this film streamed from the by-mail/internet disc rental company on my gaming console with the green X on the controller, I was very happy to be able to show them that co-worker and her family the movie while visiting one afternoon.  She and her husband (also from India) both thoroughly enjoyed telling myself and my family about how realistic things were in the film.

I would dearly love to have this film on Blu-ray or the now defunct HD DVD format.  It's a very good film, and for some it might even hit the status of great.  It is certainly well worth viewing, and would be a definite buy on Blu-ray (if it was available) if that was possible.  On DVD, well, I'm holding out for now in the hopes it eventually comes out on Blu-ray, but at the right price it would be a nice addition to anyone's collection.",1230595200,6,2689,4.344
3406231,5,B0017H3UOS,"I rented it based on all the reviews here and it was a terrific movie. Definitely like ""Office Space"" but more substantive and timely. Funny, good script, well acted and set in India which creates a setting for the humor and timeliness. Rent it!",1229817600,3,245,4.590909090909091
3406232,2,B0017H3UOS,"5 Stars? Really?  So this is up there with 'The Godfather' and 'Citizen Kane'?  Look, I get that this is supposed to be a lighthearted romantic comedy but it was utterly predictable and dull, with a cliched ""fish out of water"" plot right out of Scriptwriting 101.  Sample scene: man tells his boss there is no way he is traveling to India.  Want to guess what the next scene will be?  The whole film is like this, moving from one predictable plot point to another with obvious jokes so blunt that they could be punctuated with a rimshot on the soundtrack.  Josh Hamilton in the lead role doesn't help much as he is too bland to conjure any believable chemistry with Asif Basra.

Yes, a lot of the events in the film are the types of things an expat would experience traveling and working in India.  But a film needs more than veracity to achieve greatness -- and this film is not great - or even good.",1228608000,3,901,4.3532934131736525
3406233,4,B0017H3UOS,"Outsourced was an entertaining and very funny film which I rate at four stars along with the majority of Amazon reviewers.  The film obviously is about outsourcing and presents this as a source of wealth, but also a potential problem even for India when competing with China in the world market.

The story is delightful and paints the working population of India as practical, competitive, polite and hard working. It also pulls no punches about the many problems of India.  The opening scenes are charming showing an American businessman traveling through India to his new assignment and his encounters with colorful local people.

One scene which typifies the film illustrates his travels on a crowded Indian train where a small boy offers him his seat. Then, as if it were the most natural thing, the boy climbs into his lap and resumes his fidgeting. A little later when the businessman offers another small boy some money as charity the child hugs the man out of gratitude. Then, just as we start to think ""how nice"", the child lifts his wallet.",1225238400,4,1051,4.822222222222222

3406235,4,B0017H3UOS,"Outsourced is one of those quiet movies that are nevertheless an enjoyable watch.  When Josh finds his job outsourced to India, to add insult to injury he is asked to go over there and train his replacement. Initially angry he finds in India both love and appreciation for the good things at home in the USA that he had neglected for years. India is grimy, poor and incredibly lively.

Shot on location in India and the USA this is a movie of contrasts from a land where people have so much money that they can spend it on the junk that is sold from the Indian call centre to a country where people are so poor that they quite literally wash and live on the streets.  I enjoyed this movie - it doesn't try to whitewash the grimy portions of India, but it also shows you the warmth of the people which in my experience rings true. This is not a love-conquers-all movie, but its one which you come away with a good feeling about.",1224979200,,927,4.285714285714286
3406236,5,B0017H3UOS,What a great find!  This is a charming comedy that mixes cross-cultural faux pas with romance.  India offers a rich canvas for this original plot.  Some scenes were so funny and memorable that we replayed them after watching the film. They were still funny the second time around.  I highly recommend this film that will please both men and women.,1224979200,23,347,4.733333333333333
