8102564,4,B000DN6LUM,"I enjoyed this film.  It was wonderful to watch Sen'ei Ikenobo and others make arrangements, which is what the film is.  The only issue I have with it is that it is not a very specific ""How to"".  Although the arrangers speak a little bit about what style they are doing and why they chose a particular bit of nature, there was no specific discussion of Shin, Soe or Tai lines, nagashi lines, etc. (The guts of Ikenobo Ikebana)

I've studied Ikenobo Ikebana, so this didn't bother me, but if you're new to Ikebana and wanting specifics, this isn't the film for you.  However, it is quite an enjoyable film anyway.  Sen'ei has a good sense of humor!",1174262400,8,647,4.440677966101695
