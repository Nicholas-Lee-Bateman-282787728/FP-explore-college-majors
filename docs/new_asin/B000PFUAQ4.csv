2818048,4,B000PFUAQ4,"A nerdy college outcast , Bickford Shmeckler (Patrick Fugit of Almost Famous fame) has written a book of ideas about the nature of existence that would make the average persons head spin. While pondering an ending to his book, a sorority girl, Sarah (Olivia Wilde) ""borrows"" the book and is blown away by it's insights. She gives the book to a friend, who gives to another person and another until Bickford's writings are being passed all around campus.

As he hunts down his prized possession he has the joy of being introduced to a few strange characters that have come into contact with the book. Matthew Lillard is a crazy homeless guy who believes in extra-terrestrial beings who control his thoughts and thinks Bickford can get them to leave. John Cho leads an AD&D group that drops everything to spread the gospel of the book (a la Mao's little red book). It turns out everyone who reads the book either has a mental orgasm or feels enlightened by the thoughts on life, the universe and everything. Bickford has become a reluctant star, messiah and object of desire.

Casting Patrick Fugit in the lead role was an interesting choice, but good one. He's a brooding emo kid with issues who also happens to be a philosophical genius. Bickford has a troubled past and a high-anxiety present, but Fugit plays him with enough of a light touch that he comes as across as more funny than sad. Early on, Bickford seems pretentious and anti-social; simply obsessed with getting the book back. Slowly he learns that there are more important things than pondering the meaning of the universe. As he openes up to the world, we see more of what makes this guy tick.

In all, this isn't your typical college comedy filled with drinking and nudity. It's offbeat, and that's what makes it interesting from your run of the mill American Pie formula of comedies. It's worth checking out for a different take on the same old thing.",1199750400,11,1918,4.7023809523809526
2818049,4,B000PFUAQ4,its a really good movie if you like comedys with i guess some meaning to them. i thought it was pretty interseting and funny. the kid pretty much has this mental break down and starts writing these really advanced philosifies about life untile a girl steels it and it gets through to a book store selling coppies of it because its so amazing. the story follows him trying to find it.,1188518400,2,383,4.408450704225352
2818050,5,B000PFUAQ4,"Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas was the best movie I have ever seen. Everything about it was awesome, fundamentally, of course. The cast was put together extremely well. The storyline is so original, yet still relative. More films should be made in this style. Not only was it a superb piece of cinematic excellence, but I wouldn't be too hard-pressed to say it was quite life-altering. I look forward to viewing the documentary about the director, Scott Lew, whose story is remarkable, and gives the film even more meaning. My gratitude and praise to Scott for making such a wonderful movie with such an inspiring message. If only there could be hundreds more.",1188432000,3,661,4.910714285714286
2818051,3,B000PFUAQ4,"Bickford Shmeckler is one smart nerd, with a philosophical insight into the universe which is not only mind-blowing but hugely sexy, too.  What's more, he's written down all his cool ideas in a book he keeps in his room.

But is he happy?  Of course not... He's a tormented loner genius, barely able to keep it together at college.

And he's not going to be happy soon.

During a party at his house, a woman stumbles into his room, reads a bit of the book, gets turned on -- and then steals it.

The rest of the film follows Bickford trying to get the book back.  The book turns out to be irresistable as it's handed around, copied, and even spawns a small cult.  There are a lot of familiar B movie situations and eccentric characters -- and of course there's a love interest for Bickford.

The film tries to straddle the worlds of 1980's teen sex comedies and an off-kilter indie sensibility.  It's more of the former than the latter, but it's reasonably entertaining and smarter than the sex comedy comparison might make it sound.

After all, when was the last time you saw a teen sex comedy where smart is the ultimate sexy and the teen hero's main problem is regaining control over his intellectual property?",1187481600,4,1213,4.518348623853211

2818069,4,B000PFUAQ4,"In some ways, this is sort of a Romantic comedy in reverse.  Instead of the shy, mousey nerd going after the gorgeous co-ed, in this case it is the beauty (Sarah, played by Olivia Wilde) pursuing the nerd (Bickford /  Pat Fugit).  Say what????  It all starts when the nerd has a party @ his house.  Or, more specifically, his roommates hold a party while Bickford is disinterested in the ordeal as he's not a particularly gregarious person.  He bumps into Sarah, and she impulsively ends up stealing his diary out of his room (she is not even aware that he's the author).  Of course, this is no ordinary diary.  Rather, it mixes philosophy with theoretical physics with metaphysics.

The book goes missing and ends up being passed around.  It then becomes a sort of ""cult classic"" on campus.  Bickford just wants it back as he only wrote it for himself.  Sarah wants him to forgive him for pilfering the book, but the nerd doesn't seem to notice that he has  a babe who is WAY out of his league who is actually(!) interested in him.

The result is an unconventional Romantic Comedy that defies the usual formula for Romantic Comedies.  I will admit that the #1 reason I bought this movie was to see Olivia Wilde.  She gives a terrific performance as a curious nympho who is beginning to see that there is more to relationships than acrobats in the bedroom..  Beyond that, Sarah ends up being infinitely likeable in spite of her cleptomaniac tendencies.  All in all, a very fun movie!!",1466640000,3,1484,4.577946768060836

2818097,5,B000PFUAQ4,"In world full of college comedies about half naked sorority girls running around in teeny tiny dresses and lewd jokes, this is more than a breath of fresh air. It's standing on a mountaintop, letting the wind whip through your hair as you fill your lungs.

Bickford Shmeckler is the epitome of an introvert. He lives secluded from his housemates in a basement bedroom and devotes all his time to The Book, where he pours out all of his genius ideas. During a fateful toga party, a seductive blonde artist named Sarah finds The Book, and upon being mentally blown away by Bick's wonderings, steals it to finish reading. She then passes it on to a friend, and it is continually passed on until the entire campus is reading it, experiencing pleasurable ""braingasms"" while reading. Bickford doesn't take too kindly to his Book going missing, and even less kindly when he finds that The Book is being distributed campus wide. He ropes Sarah into helping him get it back as she was the one who stole it, and along the way he encounters several colorful characters who have also been affected by The Book, whether for the better or worse.

I may be biased as a fan of Patrick Fugit's acting, but personally I'd love to hand out a copy of this to absolutely everyone in my life. I had a braingasm of my own the first time I saw it!",1370304000,5,1323,4.485477178423237

If you are expecting a run-away-hit, multi-million dollar blockbuster, this movie is not for you.  But for a film with an extremely small budget (just $1 million) and a cast of up-and-coming actors, this movie is really top-notch!  Look for Scott's cameo in the last half of the movie, where he beeps his wheelchair horn at Bickford!  If you like this movie, you will also enjoy the documentary ""Living With Lew,"" which is all about Scott Lew's battle with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) and contains lots of great behind-the-scenes footage of the making of ""Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas.""  If nothing else, the documentary will give you an even greater appreciation of the awesome accomplishment of making this movie and awareness of what it is like to live with ALS.",1330905600,,890,4.939597315436242
2818099,3,B000PFUAQ4,Straight up I bought this movie because I have taken an interest in Olivia Wilde. She is a good actress but hopefully some of her forth coming movies will be better vehicles for her talents. The movie itself was worth a laugh or two.,1319068800,,233,4.318181818181818

That alone got me through the film, because if I'd actually expected this film to be funny or good, I'd have turned it off halfway through. This flick tries really, really hard to be a lot of things & in the end it got bogged down under it's own weight.

The plot is incredibly simple. Boy writes book. Boy looses book via a klepto nymphomaniac. Book becomes popular. Boy meets nympho. Really & truthfully, I can't put my finger on any one thing that really made this movie into a 3 star rating for me. The plot was ok. The acting was ok enough. It's just that when you get down to it, the movie really wasn't all that funny & when you're trying to pass yourself off as a cutesy college sex comedy, the laughs are important.

It's interesting to see how many stars of teen comedies were in this film, though. I guess in the end, the movie's big flaw was that it just tried too hard. It had the potential to be better than what it was, but the film was just lackluster. It's not an abomination, but I wouldn't see making this into anything other than a movie rental or something to watch if it's on tv.",1264291200,,1144,4.219178082191781

2818104,4,B000PFUAQ4,"I didn't expect much from this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Some classify it as a sex comedy, but at its heart it really isn't any such thing.  Yes, there are a couple of semi-nude scenes, but they really aren't central to the story.  Instead, this is a story about the anxiety of losing one's diary.  In this case, it isn't a social life diary, but an intellectual life diary.  All kinds of comical situations arise when Bickford's precious book is stolen by a young vixen, then lost by her boyfriend.  It is a pleasant surprise to watch a movie where one's intellect, as expressed in 'the book,' is admired by all who come into contact with this unusual diary.  There is a bit of coarse language, but not as much as is usual in these type of comedies.  Also, the laughs do not arise out of slapstick drivel, but out of the unexpected logical outcome of its setup.",1224720000,5,876,4.43125
2818105,5,B000PFUAQ4,"The thing about Patrick Fugit is that since his role in Almost Famous we haven't seen him much. Mostly he has been in television programs and movies like Saved, which received far more press than this film, but did not have him as the main character.  Although this film will not be filed away in the archives of fabulous film-making, I feel that it has some merit and is worth watching.  I first saw it on Comedy Central, and I knew that I would like the story, which is a ""boy-meets-girl"" type, but with an added twist, as the film involves a brilliant but stressed out college kid with mysterious problems--the attractive blonde fills in the rest.  Not an excellent plot, but funny and a ""feel good"" movie. If you have the time to spare, check it out.",1218844800,2,754,4.449275362318841

Since he lives in the basement of a noisy frat house he doesn't have many quiet moments of solitude. Rarely does Bickford go upstairs and talk to anybody. He thinks they are all inferior to him anyhow. One night his curiosity gets the better of him and he ventures upstairs. Bickford meets Sarah (Wilde) an extremely hot sorority sister. She is stoned and flirtatious and Bickford grows bored with her quickly. After he leaves she goes down to his room and discovers the book. She starts paging through it and experiences some kind of orgasm. She steals the book since it had that kind of effect on her. When Bickford discovers this he tells anyone who will listen that he has been raped. Emotionally raped that is. He tries to track Sarah down only to discover that she no longer has the book. She shared it with her musician boyfriend who threw it in the trash. A homeless schizophrenic (Matthew Lillard) who hears aliens is the next to pick it up. After he reads a few pages he comes to the conclusion that Bickford can help him.  He won't give Bickford the book until he helps him defeat the aliens. The book winds up in the hands of a Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast (John Cho). He quits the game so he can make photocopies and distribute it on campus. One of Bickford's professors (Cheryl Hines) is the last person to whom the book passes. She's so impressed that one of her students could write something like this she contacts a publisher (Clark Gregg) who offers Bickford a large amount of money for his Cool Ideas. While Bickford grapples with the notion of selling out we learn the causes of what made him this way. It's all a bit like ""Garden State"". Bickford had a sick mom, is severely depressed and removed, and all it takes is a good looking gal to snap him out of it and get him to start living again.  The film is too quick at eighty odd minutes to leave any lasting impressions but Patrick Fugit is the ideal leading man and Olivia Wilde is so damn hot that you don't doubt for a second that she could get Bickford excited.

Olivia Wilde is the beautiful (and smart) girl who throws his world into a tailspin by stealing it from his room. When further mischief gets his book published and distributed around campus, Bickford must come to terms with his own behavior, and decide whether to live his ideas or keep them locked away in his book.

Of course, the hot chick and nerd hook up.  He won't stop acting like an emo kid and she dumps him.  They get back together, kiss kiss, make-up garbage.  And to think, all he had to do was write a ""sex poem"".

This film is for the most part, funny and light-hearted. Director Scott Lew packs a lot of typical college humor in (party mishaps, D&D geeks who hang out in a comic shop - one of which is John Cho from Harold & Kumar!, etc.), but it all works -- I even found the bits with Matthew Lillard as a campus misfit named ""Spaceman"" enjoyable. Where it goes slightly awry is when it tries to introduce some seriousness in the form of why Bickford is so socially-challenged. Adding in emotional conflicts seemed to halt the story and put too dark a slant on the intent. The director was suffering from ALS when the movie was being made.

I did like the made up word ""braingasm""....the dorky D&D kids in this sadly reminded me of some of my AP classes in high school.

Still, Fugit pulls it all off with his sideways smile and adorable quirkiness (although, I am starting to wonder if he falls down in every movie on purpose, or if he's just clumsy). So, if you're in the mood for something cute, funny, and light, Bickford is good for a once-over. It will make you laugh, and it's worth watching just to see Fugit do what he does best.

What I found amusing most of all was the legion of followers he gains from just being crazy and writing random things down in ""The Book"".
