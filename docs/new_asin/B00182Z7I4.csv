3411403,5,B00182Z7I4,"We had finished watching the US series Leverage and was looking for another series along a similar line. We found Hustle, a delightful British series.  I think that this series is even better than Leverage which we really like.  Each episode involves a complicated long con which is often financed by a series of short cons. The short con parts of the story are very educational as they train the viewer to be on the lookout for the type of cons that they might encounter.  It is a given that each victim of the long con really deserves to be cheated. At the  end of each episode there is a brief recap to show the viewer what happened.  Especially in series 1-3, there is usually a twist that he  viewer did not see coming and it is very helpful to see how the twist was pulled off.  The cast is very good and the stories are great. Enjoyable entertainment.",1260316800,,858,4.3584905660377355
3411404,5,B00182Z7I4,"HUSTLE is a delicious series featuring a company of cohorts who make it their business to ""get the bad guys"" by performing ""Hustles"" on them!

It becomes extremely fascinating to watch the tight knit collaborations of the gang go after people who have taken advantage of others.  Their plans are elaborate and complex but always highly entertaining.

The series star's are each able to bring their particular expertise to the fold.  A gorgeous girl, a clever orchestrator, a brilliant thinker, a young hotheaded newcomer and a wise mentor.  Robert Vaughn of American Television and films is juxtaposed with the British cast.

The production values are first-rate and each episode features a different venue and setting for the fun and games.  Sometimes the story is bittersweet and other times it is completely hilarious but one is never bored.  Quick paced and underscored with great music, it was at the time, a cutting edge production.  It still give enormous pleasure to watch.

3411405,5,B00182Z7I4,"Back in the early 1960's, there was a television series called ""The Rouges,' starring Charles Boyer, Gig Young, Robert Coote, and Gladys Cooper (does anyone remember them?).  This gang of international thieves regularly bilked the rich and wanton and powerful out of some of their gain, ill-gotten or otherwise, with style and panache.  HU$TLE recaptures all the charm of that earlier series with a new group of accomplished cons headed by the inimitable Robert Vaughn and the oh-so-smooth Adrian Lester.  Over four seasons, this team of scammers takes advantage of the deserving greedy with some of the most elaborate stings and swindles you are ever likely to see.  Smartly written, well acted, and cleverly constructed, HU$TLE is so refined that you won't see the hoax happen until well after it's over.  So pop in a disc, settle back, and prepare to enjoy some of the best laid schemes ever devised come together with seamless skill and witty finesse.  Then watch it again to see if you can spot how they pull it all off.  Take my word for it: watching the bad guys getting a well-deserved come-uppance never looked so good.  These Brits are so good, they make it look easy!",1255132800,,1178,4.825870646766169
3411406,5,B00182Z7I4,"As I watched this series I have discovered a whole new world I didn't even know existed.  I don't know if I marveled more at the ability of the writer who wrote the script for the series or the super talented actors who breathed life into that script.

The characters, while they may not possess super-human abilities, nevertheless have abilities and skills that make them practically supermen.  They have brilliant minds and array of skills and abilities that would make them super successful in any area of life. They gave a whole new meaning to a word ""mastermind"".  With each new episode, the characters, like chameleons, take on new personalities - they become whoever is most suitable for the game they play.  They can think on their feet, speak with different accents, always seem to say the right thing to get them what they want, and for that they also possess an super knowledge of psychology and human nature.  They have a wide range of skills from alarms to slapping professionally designed websites overnight to getting and working any props they can possibly need to play the game and bring it to desired conclusion.  Each one seems to have an encyclopedic knowledge on any topic - or at least enough of it to bluff his way through any situation.

And of course, in spite of all the skills they have, we wouldn't love them so much if it weren't that they are indulging in con games not just for fun and profit, but also to teach really bad guys lessons.  Their marks are well screened, people who have used and abused others and made money from others for a very long time, and if it happens that the mark has a change of heart and develops a conscience during the game, they let the mark go free.  These are con artists with a conscience who never play games upon those who are open hearted, generous and who live honorable lives.  And now and then, the con artists fall pray to other con artists, as they say ""win some and lose some"".

While each episode portrays one big con, within those big cons, sometimes they play short cons - cons that most average people may fall for, but even those average people only fall for those cons if they are governed by greed, by desire to get something for nothing.  Among the other short cons they play precious dog in a bar routine, pigeon drop, jamaican switch, three card monte, and a number of others.",1248998400,20,2359,4.535377358490566

3411413,4,B00182Z7I4,"[Sept. 4, 2015 - After seeing all 8 seasons, I frankly can't decide which of the two casts is superior.  As vibrant and therapeutically  sexy as Jaime Murray (Stacy) is, Kelly Adams (Emma) brings to the show an innocence that resonates with the protective father, mother, or sibling in the audience.  And the lovable bad boy Danny (Marc Warren), was, especially in his capacity as a surrogate leader of the gang, threatening to disrupt the balance of power in world's most cohesivel (and ethical) band of con operatives.

The show loses momentum in the final 2 seasons--whether due to inferior scripts or the audience's unavoidable familiarity with the ""rules"" governing each scenario and narrative--it's difficult to say.  But I found myself losing patience with scripts (along with camera work and editing) that predictably and slickly portrayed the implementation of each con like ""clockwork""--anything close to authentic drama or suspense be damned!  (I sense that Hitchcock would have loved the premise of the show but quickly rejected the weekly episodes).

Just one flagrant example of what  was wrong with each of the shows in an otherwise wonderful series: week after week, we witness that same self-congratulatory winking at the camera by any one of our favorite con artists.  (We already KNOW they're consummate players at the game you play.  But why rub it in?  Give the audience the freedom to consider the possibility, at least, of failure and, once averted, to applaud our heroes' gamesmanship without our Robin Hoods cueing us with those smug smirks at the camera.  We're NOT as obtuse as Eddie (one of my favorite characters, since we can readily relate to him--even experience a fleeting sense of superiority.]

Original 5-star review: ""Hustle"" has provided this non-habitual television viewer with considerable consolation since the conclusion of ""Mad Men"" (the best defense of the boob tube that I could offer--if only someone would get the show's protagonist, Jon Hamm, into a James Bond flick, the sooner the better).  ""Hustle"" offers the viewer similar pay-offs--from the ageless (but well-seasoned) Robert Vaughan to the consummate Shakespearean actor Adrian Lester (whatever happened to Kenneth Branagh?).  And we mustn't overlook the first four seasons' curmudgeonly, talented and lovable (in equal amounts) two ""wild childs""--Danny (Marc Warren) and Stacie (Jaime Murray--the best cure for anyone having difficulty getting over Christina Hendricks).

The second quartet of the 8-season show dispenses with both of the latter two characters, but it makes up for their omission by tighter scripts along with camera work and editing that has, by this time in the series, learned how to serve the story rather than compete with it.  At its worst, the show delivers confidence games that are all style and no substance, each hoax and heist accomplished by our recurring characters with overly predictable confidence, competence and ease (The show based on ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" Is such an episode.  What should be a con job full of humor through the mocking of sartorial excess by, in effect, disrobing the pretentious ""marks"" (the targets of the con operators) is instead a humorless and unsuspenseful dud: the show is ALL clothes, a ""pig pile"" that suffocates story, tone and character.

When the show puts character and story first, it's unbeatable.  The main characters' con game is also the viewer's: we enjoy playing it with them every week (actually every day, which is as close as I dare get to ""binge"" watching).  Admittedly, much of the show's attraction derives from the acting and the collaboration we witness (and admire) among the five characters.  Only one recommendation, were the series to continue: make the characters occasionally ""scr*w up.""  When every con is pulled off flawlessly--like ""clock-work""--the viewer is soon ""on to the con"": the scripts become predictable, leaving us with ONLY character and style to focus on.

Of course, there are happy exceptions.  At this precise moment I'm viewing the pyrotechnical, virtuoso camera work of Episode 3 of Season 5 (about a stolen diamond).  If you chooose to ""role-play"" the camera operator instead of one of the characters, the reward will be a textbook lesson in using advanced editing techniques not to ""dazzle"" the viewer but to place him in the consciousness of each of the characters, whose motives and moves are neither obvious nor predictable. Only when we share the characters' ""apparent"" uncertainties and fears does the show aspire to the Hitchockian levels that only the master himself attained--even without benefit of digital software programs.",1436745600,,4658,5.235531628532974

The cast has changed slightly in the years but for the most part--and with the exception of the season when Michael Stone (Micky Bricks) was supposedly in Australia selling some willing dupe the Sydney Opera House--the work is a fine meshed and well acted performance of very good stories.  The American series ""Leverage"" is sort of based on Hustle but it has nowhere near the panache, or silkiness of Hustle.  It's fun to attempt to figure out how the con will work and to see how the crew anticipates and meets any unplanned hiccups that arise.  Oh that there were more series like this one.

You can find summaries of the series in other reviews so I won't do that here.  I will suggest that you spend some money on a region free DVD player (less than $50) and save more money by buying the individual series from the UK.  The series has ended with Season 8 available on DVD from the UK.  You can buy all of the first four seasons--and the DVD player--for what you'll pay for this four series set.

The soundtrack is very cool too, but that might be subjective. The cast is well rounded, and the cons plausible and fun. Generally, only the ""bad guy"" gets conned, so it's usually a happy ending each episode.

Suitable for the whole family, with some light parental guidance (due to gun-play and occasional suggestive situation).

3411439,5,B00182Z7I4,"There's a right proper glow to this 'un. Odds are, you won't run into a more charming bunch of scamming scamps. Catch one episode of HUSTLE and see if this assembly of Brits (and one Yank), with their twinkle of the eye and those roguish grins, don't rapidly get you rooting for them. More engaging than LEVERAGE and with a more sympathetic cast - and with LEVERAGE a terrific show - I am hooked on HUSTLE and I'm only cheesed that I found this show years after it first came out.

Mickey Stone - a.k.a. Mickey Bricks - is a posh gent, an elegant crook. Mickey is the master of the long con, meaning that he'll patiently spend weeks to set up a mark and, often times, the mark won't even know afterwards that he'd been fleeced. That's how slick and meticulous Mickey Bricks is. And when he gathers a crew of likeminded grifters, they rapidly become the scourge of London. Viewers with an eye towards a life of crime would be well served by taking notes. The art of the con has never been more stylish, and these quick-witted instructors breezily impart tricks of the trade and bromides to live by, such as ""You can't con an honest man"" and ""Find someone who wants something for nothing - which shouldn't be hard - and then give nothing for something.""

Mickey is the inside man, a manipulator of the psyche, and he'll smoothly steer a sucker along the map he'd drawn out. Albert Stroller - or Albie - is the distinguished old Yank. Albie (Robert Vaughn) is the roper - that is, one who ropes in the marks. Albie is also an unrepentant card cheat. Ashley Morgan is the peerless scrounger and fixer extraordinaire, and he's not too shabby at bouncing himself off cars (when there's a need for such a short con). The exquisite Stacie Monroe, her of the stunning set of pins (we call them legs on this side of the pond), makes for the ideal lure. Not that that's all she does. As the series begins, Mickey has just served a two year stint in stir and he wants nothing more than to quit the conning game. As such, he recruits these nogoodniks for one last hurrah, one final big score. Never mind that Mickey Stone is under constant police surveillance.

Con men have to roll with the punches, have to adapt to unforeseen shifts of events. In the middle of their big sting, Mickey's crew is startled by the appearance of the edgy Danny Blue, a short con expert looking to shoehorn in on the deal, looking like a young Malcolm Mcdowell. Danny Blue aims to learn from the master, and, in the London underworld, Mickey Bricks' name is legend. Danny Blue, though brash and coarse and ambitious, can still muster a measure of the clever and charm, and he worms his way into the crew's good graces, despite reservations from Mickey. And, for the next few series, Danny and Mickey's rivalry would be a recurring thread.

It's a bit baffling how HUSTLE can continually work off that same template and yet make it seem fresh. Goes like this: the con is set up - the mark is roped in - a plot swerve surfaces which has us thinking, uh oh, the con's gone off the rails - but, psyched, once again Mickey Bricks' precision masterminding has accounted for every contingency. Even Danny Blue admits that Mickey is brilliant with ""all the la-de-da-de complicated haven't got a clue what's goin' on 'til the very end stuff."" HUSTLE has churned out so many surprising twist endings that M. Night Shyamalan is resentful. And I guess it never gets old when our likable grifters pull one over on them avaricious moppets.

I'm lying, though. Sometimes the show veers off formula. There are a few episodes in which our crew gets the tables turned on them. Another bromide in the con game: ""Don't let a mark get under your skin."" Our grifters aren't infallible all the time. It simply makes them even more likable.

What really sells it, though, is a cast that can knock the socks off the script. HUSTLE trots out graceful actors who can create magic with their chemistry and craft. Even Robert Glenister (""Ashley Morgan"") - whom I initially assumed would be the most to the background delegated character - has since proven to be an accomplished and engaging performer. It helps that they sometimes directly communicate with the viewing audience. There hasn't been such a shameless streak of breaking of the fourth wall since in KUFFS or FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF. Me, I loved it whenever the characters - and each of the crew does it - bestow sly looks and knowing smiles at the camera. As well, they aren't shy about freezing the action so as to relate certain intricacies of the con to you and to each other.

This DVD set brings the first four series, thus equating to 24 solid episodes - and, yeah, it's steeply priced but so worth it. See these affable cool customers wield their brand of crooked justice on them deserving greedy wankers. See them trick the constabulary silly. Also see them time and again wiggle out of paying Eddie the befuddled bartender for drinks as they plot their latest capers at his bar.

I've quite a few favorite episodes. ""Cops & Robbers"" pits our crew against the con man's bogeyman, a savvy retired cop what's already nicked a gallery of the world's most notorious grifters. ""The Lesson"" - involving a fake rare American $1000 bill - results in one of the show's most unexpected cons. ""Missions"" has a similar flavor to ""Cops & Robbers"" in that there's a corrupt cop thinking she could manipulate Mickey and his crew. This one centers around a forged rare comic book, and, yeah, the cop gets what's coming to her. The Series 2 finale - ""Eye of the Beholder"" - features the gang's most ambitious heist yet: the theft of the Royal Jewels. As an extra wrinkle, the C.I.D. is onto them. In ""Ties That Bind Us"" Richard Chamberlain guest stars as a fellow con man who's out to get the bank that ruined his great grandfather. We also get a brilliant turn by Adrian Lester (""Mickey Bricks"") as he pays homage to Charlie Chaplin in the episode's flashback segments styled after a silent film. ""The Hustler's News of Today"" has the gang messing about with a seedy tabloid rag and foisting a fabricated scandal about the Queen Mum on the paper's unprincipled publisher and lead reporter.

But hands down the most fun episode of the show is the second episode from Series 3, as Mickey and Danny's rivalry comes to a head and they're forced to compete for the crew's leadership in ""The Henderson Challenge."" The rules of engagement dictate that the two dueling grifters are dropped naked in the middle of London and left to see who can amass the most swag in six hours' time. One of the most intriguing elements of this episode is that we see Danny and Mickey's warring philosophies on the con collide, the headspinning virtuosity of the short con versus the fruitful expansiveness of the long con. And the best part: Just when you think all the cons were over, there's one more yet.

Series 4 finds Mickey Bricks going on sabbatical, leaving Danny Blue to step up as the crew's temp leader, not that his reign begins all that smooth. ""As One Flew Out, One Flew In"" is a caper that lands our Brits in Hollywood and has them stealing the Hollywood sign, and you note right away that Danny's improvisional methods come off rough around the edges when compared to Mickey's more thorough, never-leave-it-to-chance planning. Still, Danny formulates his most accomplished con in ""Getting Even"" as a ruthless businesswoman is bamboozled by way of her yen for wine collecting. Danny Blue is rather brilliant in this ep.

If I have one nag, it's that the romantic in me isn't well compensated. Implications aren't played out; that romantic triangle of Stacie, Mickey, and Danny isn't at all resolved. So I do feel a bit cheated, especially since Marc Warren and Jaime Murray (""Danny Blue"" and ""Stacie"") leave the show after Series 4. But at least Series 5 - which isn't collected here - has Mickey Bricks returning to the fold and assembling a new tricky crew. HUSTLE, with its panache and whimsy and great acting and clever misdirections, is wildly entertaining. It's got me so invested that I decided I had to get my hands on an all-regions free DVD player just so I can buy the Series 5-7 DVDs, which aren't yet available on Region 1. And to demonstrate how well I've learned this show's lessons, I cleverly hinted to my friend that an all-regions free DVD player would make the ideal birthday present. That's right, I'm tricky too. ""Give nothing for something,"" indeed. Because when my friend's birthday rolls around, I don't plan on giving him jack sh--.",1311465600,2,8544,4.6181698485845954

It's smart and innovative and keeps you guessing unlike a lot of the ""who done it?"" shows in the U.S. I highly reccommend this show. I do have to mention that this series didn't end after the fourth season. It's still on tv in the U.K. and I believe they are now on the sixth, maybe seventh, season. I just wish they would release seasons 5 and 6 on DVD here in the U.S.",1303862400,,466,4.021505376344086

In the few weeks that I was outside the U.S. I watched several episodes and found them to be  quite entertaining.  So far i've watched all four seasons included, and can't wait until seasons 5 and 6 get released in the U.S.  The story lines aren't really connected from episode to episode, but each episode has so many twists and turns that I found myself completely enthralled.  I highly recommend this item, it's definitely worthwhile.",1278374400,,559,4.842105263157895

It has to be said that Marc Warren doesn't do as well as the lead (in season 4) as he did as the supporting comic act (in seasons 1-3), and the intelligence of the plots suffers from the need for Danny to stay in character.  Even so, season 4 is still a lot of fun.  But Adrian Lester is back in Season 5.  Can't wait.

I suppose I could start again from episode 1.",1267660800,,513,3.980392156862745
3411447,3,B00182Z7I4,"Hello,

being from Germany I am always looking for an ""original"" DVD on which the episodes were not cut. The German edition is cut and the British is said to have been in the beginning at least, too. Furthermore there are no subtitles at all on the British edition. Hopefully I ordered the uncut version here but the so called subtitles are ""closed captions"" only which are not common in Europe.
So from my point of view shame on all publishers and also on Amazon which claimed that there are subtitles not ""closed captions"". At the moment I am looking for a codefree DVD-Player with ""closed captions"" feature but I fear that this will be very difficult here in Germany. The only solution so far is to watch the DVDs on the PC with PowerDVD that is able to resolve ""closed captions"".

8268354,3,B00182Z7I4,"My husband & I enjoyed the first 3 seasons of Hustle. The Mickey character & actor were replaced in the 4th Season - it was not a good move. The higher end type of cons weren't possible with the new mix of characters & the series lost its appeal for us.

The overall premise is comparable to Leverage - a series we enjoyed quite a bit. However, the 'morality' & principles of this group (as compared to the Leverage teams) are not as high as we like our heros / anti-heroes to be in the US. The action scenes were not as dramatic; the character interactions & side plots not as humorous. So if you're looking for a Leverage clone, this is not a good choice.

There was a charm to this show that kept us watching but we agreed we were unlikely to watch them again in a year or so.",1469750400,2,779,4.118421052631579
