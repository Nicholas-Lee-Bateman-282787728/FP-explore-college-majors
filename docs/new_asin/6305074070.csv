It was quite disappointing.
This is just another VHS-to-DVD transfer!
Albeit slightly better than the other DVDs being sold on Amazon:-

Still there is no other alternative, if it's a DVD you want.
That is until or unless a true DVD-quality release comes out.
Hopefully sooner rather than later!

For those who do, or wish to taste a small glimpse, by all means see what this fantasy movie has to offer. It is about the biopic of Greig, a composer from Norway played by Troaly Maurstad and  supporting actors from Florence Henderson as Rigg, his wife, Harry Secombe, Edward G. Robinson and Christins Skelin.

This film has two breathe-taking reasons for watching it (the scenery of Norway and the 45 musical numbers and 25 songs), and one bad point (you have to keep adjusting the audio as the voices are soft and the music is loud, on my TV at least). Don't let this turn you away from an experience that is well worth the disruption.

Whether you like it or not will rest with you, but I thoroughly loved watching it this time as I did many years ago. Because of this film I became interested in classical music and mainly one, Beethoven's music.

If I could I would give it five stars for the scenery and five for the rest, but I can't. It will take an open heart, and mind, to watch for the first time, but you never know, you may enjoy the experience.",1391731200,,1134,4.330188679245283

The actual history is not quite correct. I give it two stars as the photography, the scenery and the buildings were beautiful. It seems to me of a lost gone by age which will never come back.
If the sound had been perfect it would have been given top marks even if the history is not quite correct.

972265,2,6305074070,"I give this film 2 stars because the photography is breathtaking! It made me want to go to Norway! The opening scenes when the title and credits are introduced, the photography backed by Griegs Piano Concerto leads you to believe there will be magic coming. Unfortunately the movie doesnt stop there. The movie takes you to an unusual place, experientially wise. This movie in some circles could be considered a comedy. The actors and singers are obviously all good (with the exception of the actor who plays Grieg) at what they do and the music of Edvard Grieg is extraordinary.  It is the idea of putting silly lyrics to Griegs music. I could hardly watch the 'trio' singing ""Hill of Dreams"". If not for the beautiful fiord sunset cinematography, I would've collapsed with laughter. And yet I love the film as bad as it is. Take the scene when the norwegian folk dancers are dancing behind the wagon carrying Grieg and his girl as they progress along a beautiful fiord singing Freddie and his Fiddle. The dancers are in folk outfits with a fiddler hopping and twisting in the lead. It is so corny you can't but break a giggle. To watch it makes it hard to keep from falling to the floor laughing. But the child in me loves the beauty of it. Its a storybook scene.  If only I would've viewed this as a child I would've given the film three stars! And when the actor who plays Grieg sings I can imagine on first run of the movie people getting up and leaving. You can tell hes a dancer because with a voice like that, he would go hungry singing.

The Cine Capri had what was then one of the largest movie screens in Arizona.  I believe it was 70mm (something-or-other) process. Scenery was gorgeous, Florence Henderson (be still, my heart!) as gorgeous as ever, and the story was great fun, although as with most film ""biographies"" of great composers, had little resemblance to Grieg's real life.  Andrew and Virginia Stone made several musical biographies, some better than others, and this film did Not get good reviews.  I loved it -for whatever that says about my taste!  I have wanted a good VHS or DVD of it for years, and finally got one from a collector - probably taken from a TV showing.  I have just a small TV set, anyhow, and I think the film is great fun.

972330,5,6305074070,"Andrew and Virginia Stone (Julie, Cry Terror) are no ordinary movie realists. In 1960, when they decided to make a movie about the sinking of an ocean liner, (The Last Voyage), they hired the aged Ile de France, hauled her out into the Pacific Ocean, and then effectively scuttled her, in the interests of their art and their commerce. In an industry where big is par, the Stones think colossal.

In 1970, their newest project opened at the Cinerama Theater, on a screen almost as wide as the Scandinavian peninsula. SONG OF NORWAY is a film resurrection of the 1944 Broadway operetta about Edvard Grieg, set to the Grieg music as edited and rearranged by Robert Wright and George Forrest, who also wrote those lyrics that Mr. Grieg somehow happened to overlook.

A saccharine fantasy with 45 musical numbers, 25 songs, international uvulas, and a production line of fjords, SONG OF NORWAY is no ordinary movie kitsch, but a display to turn Guy Lombardo livid with envy. The film, conceived as a kind of living postcard, is so full of waterfalls, blossoms, lambs, glaciers, folk dancers, mountains, children, suns, and churches, that, it raises kitsch to the status of art. Writer/director Andrew Stone composes every schlocky musical turn by cutting away to landscapes -- so that it becomes a visual ode to the Norwegian soul as defined by the Norwegian Tourist Office. If he sees a summit, you may rest assured that someone is romping up it, a sun is sinking behind it, or an airplane, carrying a camera, is buzzing it, while the movie's six-track stereo system pounds out still another reprise of the piano concerto. It quickly becomes exhausting as people keep breaking into impassioned warbling and frenetic hoofing every few minutes. No location is safe: a hayride, a ferry ride, a snowball fight, and a chase down winding village streets inevitably turn into cause for belting out a tune.

And the music is among the worst ever put on a soundtrack. Grieg didn't write show tunes, nor did he ever imagine people would be singing hackneyed versions of his classical compositions while throwing snowballs at each other. With tunes like ""Freddie and His Fiddle,"" ""The Life of a Wife of a Sailor,"" ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" and the appropriately titled ""Strange Music,"" the film simultaneously brings joy to the eyes as the lyrics lay waste to the ears!

The cast includes Toralv Maurstad, a blond Norwegian actor too elderly to play the young Grieg, Frank Porretta, a young American singer, as his best friend, and Florence Henderson, who is sometimes photographed through what looks like gauze, as his wife. If you ever paused to ask yourself: ""How come we've never seen any movies starring Florence Henderson?"" Well, the answer to that Zen-worthy riddle can be summarized in just three words: ""Song of Norway."" Yes, she can sing - but whatever charm and pleasantness she could offer for the sale of cooking oil and denture cream was nowhere to be found here.

Robert Morley, Edward G. Robinson and Oscar Homolka also appear - mostly as scenic obstructions.

SONG OF NORWAY was cruelly attacked by the critics. Pauline Kael's New Yorker barbecue was the most articulate: ""The movie is of an unbelievable badness; it brings back clichs you didn't know you knew - they're practically from the unconscious of moviegoers"" Life magazine raved: 'Godawful'. The New Yorker wondered whether it had been made by trolls. The Medved Brothers dubbed Florence Henderson, 'the female Peter Frampton for the Geritol generation'.

The film's failure was swift but its leading actors suffered the most: Maurstad never made another American movie, Porretta never made another film, and Florence Henderson was never trusted to appear in a movie until her cameo role in 1992's SHAKES THE CLOWN.

But SONG OF NORWAY does have some small rewards -- for critics (who can quote its inane dialogue), and for general audiences (who can feel superior to it).

Will there ever be an official dvd release? We can only pray.",1208044800,5,4007,4.915680473372781
972331,1,6305074070,"Song of Norway is a musical based on the life of Edvard Grieg. The film version has more camp quality than anything else, but this is not about the movie itself. Whatever one may think of it as a movie, it looked and sounded wonderful when it was new and in the movie houses. This DVD does not give justice to that. At all!!

If you manage to get hold of this British DVD edition, do not buy it. It is a terribly bad transfer of a VHS edition that was bad enough in itself. The picture is so blurry it is almost impossible even to read the opening credits. The presentation is not widescreen. The sound is so lousy that you cannot hear what they are saying and the music is way out of key. There are no subtitles to help you along the way. It is also shorter than the original movie. I do not know how much shorter, since it claims to be the original running time on the cover. But it is not. Several songs included on the soundtrack LP are missing, and I do remember seeing them performed in the original release. One musical number is even cut brutally in the middle, with a strange sound, and then nothing. This is the worst DVD presentation I have seen of any movie.",1191542400,9,1170,4.176991150442478
972332,5,6305074070,"Does anyone know who currently holds the rights to release SONG OF NORWAY in Super Panavision and 6-track stereo sound on DVD? I propose a letter-writing campaign! What is taking so long? Anchor Bay Entertainment had the rights and did, in fact, announce it for summer 2003. Sadly, they lost the rights before it could happen.

SONG OF NORWAY is my holy grail for a widescreen DVD (dare I ask, blu ray?). It has been a glaring omission on the list of properly released movie musicals and is ever more so today with HD advances.  Mr. Rightsholder, please read all these many reviews by the world community, from Bombay to Bellmore, who are positively CLAMORING for it. (Andrew Stone's follow up, THE GREAT WALTZ, has already seen the light of day of a decent widescreen stereo presentation on Turner Classic movies, though it too deserves a soundtrack CD and a first-rate DVD / blu ray!)

Many beloved films have their flubs and imperfections, and I admit SONG OF NORWAY has some curious editing anomalies. The most glaring one comes at the end of the picture, when Grieg is running through the streets to reunite with Nina, and is seen to callously knock a little girl playing hopscotch to the ground! I hereby give you, Mr. Rightsholder, my blessing to snip these 3 or 4 offending frames in the restoration process. Though the cinematography is breathtaking, I was never happy with Virginia Stone's editing choices on this picture.

A complete roadshow print with commentary by Florence Henderson, a making of documentary, interviews with surviving cast members, trailers, radio spots and more would be nice touches, as would a long overdue CD soundtrack with longer music cues and underscoring not included on the original vinyl release. How about it, Turner Rhino?

UPDATE -- September 30, 2011:  Great news! LOST HORIZON 1973 is finally remastered and on Columbia VOD, with extras to boot. One more film musical finally given its due on DVD. It is obviously somebody's pet project, having even seen an official laser disc release. But what about SONG OF NORWAY, ever so much more worthy and, arguably to some but not to me, DEFINITELY A BETTER FILM, which has languished unresolved these many decades on laser disc let alone on DVD or blu ray. How can I make this MY pet project? It's nearly one year past its 40th Anniversary -- can anyone please tell me if it is on somebody's radar for a release sometime soon?  Or, if you know the correct party to write to, would you kindly let me know? Does whoever makes decisions about what gets released read these many reviews on Amazon.com imploring its release? Although ever youthful and gorgeous, Florence Henderson is not getting any younger with regard to a possible commentary track.

972333,4,6305074070,"This was certainly an odd movie and very unusual. Whoever did this certainly had their own vision and did not follow too many footsteps of other musicals in it's day. I myself, at the time, was a movie soundtrack buff with many movies, not all musicals. Since I have not seen this particular movie in some time, I can say for a fact that the original soundtrack was more of an asset than the movie itself. I agree that the natural scenery was nothing short of awesome, but the storyline involving the movie itself is forgotten. What stuck was the cinemagic and the music. Being I had the original vinyl album release, and still have it, I found the album cover and vinyl soundtrack outrated the movie. Even the cover graphic, complete with piano outline with insets of movie scenes surrounded by blossoming daisies was exhilarting. I think I purchased the soundtrack before I saw the movie. My favorite cuts were ""Strange Music"", ""Three there were"", and ""At Christmastime."" The opening piano intro is totally unforgettable. I think Florence Henderson did a superb job with her long golden hair and wonderful voice. As an added note, I think the most memorable scene was towards the final song where there was a tense awkward moment in which a woman was forced to sing an anthem song at a dining room table in front of the fabled pianist.

The same theater used to have re-runs of great films in ""morning shows"" and this movie returned at least twice. I made it a point to see it again....and again.

I can understand why some people find it cloying or corny. It demands an innocence, a surrender to sentiment that is alien to the ""modern"" psyche; and would thus engender much pooh-poohing from people uncomfortable with (their own?) childlike emotions.

However, NOBODY could ever deny the sheer gorgeousness of it all --- the marriage of Grieg's music with STUNNING visuals and sound, underscoring the strong relationships in his life; making for a whole much greater and more moving than any of its parts.

I cant BELIEVE how this masterpiece has been allowed to languish without a decent DVD release --- the last one I'm told was woefully inadequate and is, in any case, unavailable.

972376,4,6305074070,"I first watched this movie just after its release at a movie theater in Boston in 1970 and saw it again aboard an SAS flight from Copenhagen to New York in January 1972. I was impressed with the scenery of the old country. Many of these places I have visited as a youth and as an adult. Edvard Grieg's music describes the love and adoration he had for his country. Listening to his music I can picture in my mind the beauty of Norway's picturesque, breathtaking landscape; i.e. fjords, forests, waterfalls and mountains.

Toralv Maurstad plays the famous Norwegian composer, struggling to gain fame and fortune through his music. While many of his countrymen thought of him as a failure, he gained the respect of the famous Norwegian poet, playwright and dramatist Henrik Ibsen who, his home was in the town of Grimstad where my paternal family came from, asks Grieg to compose music for his play ""Peer Gynt"" that has become one of the best known musical scores in the world today: ""Peer Gynt Suite I"" Op. 46, and ""Peer Gynt Suite II"" Op. 55, each with four movements. The opening theme ""Morning Mood"" and the third movement ""Anitra's Dance"" are the most popular themes.

Another Norwegian, Richard Nordraak, who wrote Norway's national anthem ""Ja Vi Elsker Dette Landet"" (Yes We Love This Land), becomes a close friend of Grieg by exposing his music and pulling a few strings with well-known people such as Hans Christian Andersen. Florence Henderson certainly was the perfect choice as Grieg's cousin and wife, Nina, with her beautiful singing voice and talent.

While many still criticize Grieg's works, there are many more who admire this great composer's love for Norway reflected through his numerous Small Piano Pieces, his famous ""Piano Concerto in A minor"" Op. 16, and ""In Autumn"" Op. 11.

  But most of all, this is a glorious musical.  The scenery is  breathtaking, filmed in many of the original locations where the events  took place.

Frank Poretta is charismatic as Richard Nordraak,  Grieg's long time friend and gives us a rich, powerful voice to boot.  Torav Maurstad is Norwegian and portrays Grieg with meaning and affection.  He is not a professional singer but his voice suffices as a composer  singing his own songs.
  The other supporting players add depth to  the story line and the choreography is spectacular.  The sound track, not  available as yet on CD, is beautifully transferred from the film and is a  colector's item in itself.
  There is a marvelous Christmas sequence  filmed high in a snow-packed retreat and an animated troll number set to  Peer Gynt's Suite that is delightful at any age.
