8745169,5,B019H7S7WE,"Give your home a touch of luxury by choosing one of five real fires to burn warmly in the corner of your living room.
With gentle piano music playing, the feel is reminiscent of relaxing in front of a log fire in a posh hotel with a professional pianist playing softly in the background.
The 'romantic fire' option invokes memories of eating a candlelit meal with a loved one whilst a musician plays just for the two of you.
Different tempos of music complement the lovely selection of fires.
This DVD also has the option of realistic fire sounds which combined with gently burning logs creates a relaxing ambiance for a warm and cosy feel.
In some scenes you see just the burning logs, in others the interior of the actual fireplace can be seen as well. Seeing the setting of some of the fires adds to the interest and realism.
The variety of fires and sound effects in this DVD make a lovely feature out of your television and this is a dvd which will be played again and again.

The free download is a wonderful crackling fire in a warm brick hearth. The same fire is seen throughout as it  progresses naturally from a roaring log fire down to glowing embers and gently flickering flames.",1452643200,,1191,4.483870967741935
8745170,3,B019H7S7WE,"Just OK. The fire videos were filmed in a dark room and so the only light is coming from the fires. As a result the images are kind of dark and get even darker as the fire burns down. I ordered a DVD of George Ford's Fireplace for your Home to replace this one, as to my eye it is much more realistic and the lighting makes it look like a real fireplace. If you are a Prime member, you can also stream Ford's fireplace for free. I ordered the DVD so we can watch it when not connected to the internet also.",1452643200,2,506,3.9223300970873787

I grew up with a fireplace in our living room and loved the warmth and cosines, but hated to clean up in the morning. This DVD provides all the benefits without the burdens. The vivid colours and sounds of a crackling fires complete the realistic experience.

We have often played this DVD this winter during relaxing evenings on the couch and are looking forward to more cosy evenings to come. Its nice to be able to choose out of five different fireplaces to create the right atmosphere.

Its great that the DVD comes with a free download. This enables me to take the warming fire with me wherever I go so I can always add some warmth and relaxation to my environment, in a hotel or to a friends house.
