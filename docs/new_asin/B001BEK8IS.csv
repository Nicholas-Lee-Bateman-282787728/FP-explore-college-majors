8282955,4,B001BEK8IS,"A Big Help does have some nice Clifford stories, in which Clifford helps various Birdwell Islanders, and T-Bone and Cleo think they're being helpful. The thing is, this DVD is only 30 minutes long, whereas the other collections are all 60-90 minutes, so even though it's a nice collection, it's shorter, and you can get more bang for your buck with some of the other DVDs.",1283126400,3,372,4.651515151515151
