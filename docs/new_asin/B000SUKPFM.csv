2890867,5,B000SUKPFM,This is a really nice DVD on challenging yourself to incorporate rhythmic subdivisions into your soloing.  It is not the easiest thing to sing groups of 5 [as an example] but it does become familiar enough so you can use it with your melodic approach.  I wish there was a bit more of McLaughlin's playing the examples but Selva is truly amazing in his vocalization of the rhythms.,1206835200,3,380,4.573529411764706
2890868,5,B000SUKPFM,"whew - I've been waiting years for something like this to come out...purchased John McLaughlin's 3 dvd set ""This is how I do it"" in the hopes that he would cover (or at least touch upon ) the topic covered in depth here. If you would like to know about the fundamentals of rhythm and the simplest method of breaking it down then this is certainly for you. Players of any instrument will benefit from spending time counting along and working through the progressively more difficult lessons. Very Highly Recommended Indeed! Be certain to check out the bonus footage!",1201651200,8,565,4.717171717171717
2890869,5,B000SUKPFM,"This is a very clear, well-thought-out video course on konokol: a tradional Indian system of singing a rhythm, sometimes a very complicated rhythm, against the ""metronome"" of your own clapping. (When we studied this system in college with musicians from southern India, it was called solkattu.) Konokol allows the musician to superimpose one tempo and time signature (in the singing) against another (in the clapping), and hear the two together. You can also use it to sing drum solos -- if your tongue is as fast as Selva's is in this DVD!!!

Unlike a lot of instructional DVDs, this really is a TEACHING video. The six lessons lead you progressively from the simplest concepts to complete tongue twisters, subdivisions of 5, 6, and 7, and odd time signatures. All the exercises and vocal ""solos"" appear in Western notation on screen as they are sung, so if you read music you have an additional teaching aid.

As a bonus, John McLaughlin gives a few brief examples of Mahavishnu Orchestra riffs that grew out of Konokol patterns. The camera is mostly on his left hand on the neck; I don't know if this will be frustrating to guitarists. In any case, this really isn't a guitar video. McLaughlin is more the MC, introducing Selva's performances of the exercises and solos.

This is a really well-made DVD. It drew me into learning Konokol even more than I expected. The nice thing is, you can practice without an instrument. It also helps timekeeping and understanding difficult rhythms.

A real pleasure!",1199750400,24,1506,4.87109375

8206894,3,B000SUKPFM,"I picked this up just after Christmas. I wanted so much more than I got out of this video. It is an okay overview of what is possible, but they gloss over the foundation and go straight to improv. How can one break the rules if they don't know the rules? Like another viewer conveyed- their hands are blocked a good portion of the time. It's surprising to think they didn't think that they didn't think this would be of concern. As for the hand motions, I ended-up finding some Youtube videos that, in my opinion, gave a better way to help keep track over 8 beats (instead of repeating the sequence twice like in this video). I also opted to use the 3 beat counting from the Youtube video I found instead of the one presented. Everyone learns different, so I'm just saying I found ones which works better for me. All in all, this video is an ok introduction, but doesn't really dig in deep.

Update: 8/16/13: I haven't used the video since January, but the ideas are still very much working in my head. Very often I find myself disecting phrases using ""Ta-Ka-Di-Mi"" and ""Ta-Ki-Ta"" instead of the old ""1-E-AN-A"" and so forth. Also, when I am learning a new rhythm, I've been working on Bossa Nova rhythms for example, I'll read and use the hand motions with my left hand and clap the rhythm I'm learning with my right. It has really helped my time keeping and sense of timimg. For that alone I'm glad I purchase the video. I still stand behind what I wrote above...",1364688000,5,1464,4.402214022140221
8206895,4,B000SUKPFM,"This is a great introduction to South Indian rhythmic concepts. It takes a lot of time and study and dedication and then you will have mastered the fundamentals. If you want something more comprehensive after finishing the DVD i recommend finding a teacher. Through using the exercises on this DVD (which really should be practiced DAILY, as is said in the beginning)i have become a better musician. My playing on the drum kit has improved, my guitar playing has improved, and most importantly, Konnakol is FUN! I have fun doing the exercises and improvising whenever the mood strikes me. I really enjoy this DVD and for me it was a smart purchase. The DVD isn't perfect, but these minor details don't ruin anything for me, and i'm sure other reviews have stated them so i have no need to here. If you think you could benefit from this DVD or have fun with it then i would recommend taking the risk and buying it. The choice is all yours.",1309564800,2,938,4.556213017751479
8206896,5,B000SUKPFM,"A very interesting approach to learning the Indian system of rhythm taught by two of its masters. John McLaughlin possess that rare combination of being an amazing musician as well as being a very wonderful teacher. This is a DVD that can be taken out 6 months later and reviewed; it does not get stale.
Unfortunately I lent this to a friend who lost it, or gave it away. Someday I'll order another copy. However; this is a MUST for any serious musician who'd like to expand their musical horizons.",1297728000,,498,4.544444444444444
8206897,3,B000SUKPFM,"My only complaint is that they never really explain the hand counting and you can never watch it because in all the demos they hide the view of the hands by popping up the ""sheet music"" over the top.",1239408000,3,199,4.128205128205129
8206898,5,B000SUKPFM,"In a world overflowing with guitar instrucionals and hot licks videos, here comes an educational DVD from The Master - the way it is supposed to be. This DVD deals with the South Indian(Carnatic) system of recitation called 'konokol'. In John's words, it is the simplest and most effective method of mastering rhythm in the world.(coming from a man of John's stature, you better believe that!) Konokol requires absolutely no playing ability as it is all about counting, division and mathematics- the building blocks of rhythm. the DVD starts from square one, teaching syllables and the basic language and moving on to more challenging aspects like odd time signatures - John's pet love for many years. As with John's previous educational DVD 'This Is The Way I Do It', there is a continuous scroll of notation moving along the bottom of the screen, which greatly enhances the impact of the lessons. The DVD contains six chapters, each chapter ending with a demonstration of the material by Selvaganesh Vinayakram (who plays south indian percussion along side John in Remember Shakti) followed by John's demo of the application of konokol on the guitar. Watch out for the Finale in Chapter 6, where they get together to create a beautiful guitar-konokol conversation.
Learning this system helps build a bridge between percussionists and melodic instrumentalists. An ensemble or a band conversant with konolol can articulate musical ideas very precisely to each other. Someone who has been in a band will immediately appreciate how difficult it is to get the bloody drummer to play what you want him(her) to! It is not an exaggeration to say Shakti would not have been what it is hadn't it been for konokol. The level of the music they came up with in a very short span of time would not have been possible without konokol.
Finally, please remember this is not only for drummers and percussionists. This is not only for students who play indian instruments, or wish to learn indian music on their western instruments. This truly is for everybody. Infact, it will be of value even if you do not play any instrument and want to become a knowledgable audience of Indian Classical Music. That John McLaughlin went ahead and made this DVD reveals how strongly he feels about it, and how important he thinks konokol is to save the world!",1224201600,13,2329,4.89873417721519
