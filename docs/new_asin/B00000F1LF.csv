7906591,5,B00000F1LF,"This video has a nice mixture of all the ""steel"" workouts. I used it many years ago and had great results from it, if used consistently. Tamilee Webb is easy to follow and gives great instructions for doing the exercises properly so you can really feel the muscle working properly. It's made in the early 1990's so the outfits and hairstyles are pretty humorous, but her workout is timeless. From what I can tell from her website she is still making lots of workouts videos. However, I couldn't find anything that incorporated a variety of areas (buns, legs, abs....) into one dvd. Obviously, she makes more money if she sells more videos... Possibly the reason this one has never been remade onto a DVD? So if you want to save some money and get a great workout-order this one.",1409356800,,778,4.60431654676259
7906592,5,B00000F1LF,"This is a great collection - it seems to be composed of other Tamilee Webb tapes. It is great for me, because I can use this, as well as add the original tapes if I decide too. Occasionally the transition between segments is a bit abrupt, giving me the feeling that something had been left out, but on the whole, this is a great exercise tape. I might mention that it is A tape, not several as the picture shows, I believe.",1367625600,,423,4.170731707317073
7906593,5,B00000F1LF,"I had this tape in the 90s and it worked miracles for me.  I have been looking for it for years, as it never came out on DVD.  I was so happy to find it, and it was shipped promptly and well packaged.  Def would buy from this seller again.",1349308800,,239,3.74
7906594,5,B00000F1LF,"I have lots of workout tapes,but this is one of my favorites. Its a no nonsense,[...]-kicking workout that targets all areas. I use the warm-up segment even if Im doing a different workout. Tami gives very good instructions and teaches good form.",1181433600,2,246,4.880952380952381
7906595,5,B00000F1LF,"This is The Best video that I own today...
I have the new firm video with the fanny firmer....but this flows better and not so jumpy as the firm.
This is 88 minutes long because its a combination of all 4 tapes of the classic..bun,abs,arms,and legs. I have done half segments if time is an issue, and I have done all 4 segments to get that overall workout. I like this because it uses low aerobics with weights. I'm 44 yrs. old as of tomorrow,,,I work out on a regular basis. I try to add variety to my workout and in my opinion...this is my favorite and the favorite of my cohorts that I work out with. Try it..you'll like it:)if not...pass it on to someone that likes a low aerobic impact with weights workout.",1039824000,7,712,4.281481481481482
