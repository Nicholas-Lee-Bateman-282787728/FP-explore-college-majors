8516928,1,B007HZ96F6,"Not what I wanted.  I was looking for a DVD of the BALLET ""Cipollino"" with music by Karen Khachaturian.  This turned out to be an animated cartoon of somethign that possibly resembled the story (not 100% certain as I speak no Italian, which was the language on the DVD), but not a note of music by Khachaturian, and certainly no ballet.  Very disappointed, but since it would cost more to return it it's worth I won't bother.  If anyone knows of any DVD that is the actual BALLET I'd love to know.",1425772800,,497,4.369565217391305
