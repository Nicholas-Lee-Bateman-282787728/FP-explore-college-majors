2830968,3,B000Q66QCE,"This is not a horror flick.  So don't get caught with your pants down.  I expected more, don't ask me why.  If you've not much to do sit back and watch it's got some twist that may just keep your attention.",1410220800,,206,3.975609756097561

2830972,3,B000Q66QCE,"Depicting a woman in a French maid outfit carrying a weapon, the poster promoting THE CHAMBERMAID makes this 2004 film appear to be a horror flick.  However, THE CHAMBERMAID, the story of a love triangle of bad choices and even worse choices, is not HAZEL GOES PSYCHO.  It would be stretching it to call THE CHAMBERMAID a horror film although at times it is alarming, seeing how two individuals behave with respect to their hearts' desires. A chambermaid/bartender can't help herself but to stay with her money-squandering, substance-addicted, violent boyfriend.  Her hotel manager can't help himself but to pursue her, even when it becomes clear drugging the young woman is the only way to have her in his arms.

The things we do for love.

Not surprisingly, THE CHAMBERMAID is known by an appropriate alternate title, LOVESICK: SICK LOVE.  Lead actor Fiona Horsey, playing title character Julia, seems familiar to me but reviewing her credits on the I.M.D.B. web site, THE CHAMBERMAID is my first audience with her.  She's a commanding presence, fleshing out an individual you will root for or root against - if not both -  as she does what she feels is necessary.

Despite a few too many weak plot devices, THE CHAMBERMAID will hold your attention on its strength of presenting people who refuse to accept reality as they continue chasing love when they should know it's time to cut their losses.  Perhaps we can all relate, even though we may not wish to admit it, let alone go as far as Julia and her boss do.",1370217600,3,1514,4.766283524904215
2830973,4,B000Q66QCE,"Also released under the title ""Lovesick: Sick Love."" This is the same crew that did ""Penetration Angst."" Julia (Fiona Horsey) has two jobs (chambermaid, barmaid) to support her lazy musician boyfriend, Istvan (William Rowsey). He owes some guys with a combination British-Russian accents drug money, as he also has a cocaine problem. He imposes on Julia for the cash.

The hotel that Julia works for is managed by the creepy, peeping Michael O'Ryan (Paul Conway). He has to care for an invalid unlikable mother (Jessica Barnes).

The movie turns ugly quickly as Fiona has to leave her job as a chambermaid. She gives a guest who is also a politician a hand favor in exchange for cash, which he then turns around and accuses her of stealing. However, Julia gets back at them in a way that causes her to break up with Istvan and winds up in the arms of the perverted Michael...er sort of as she constantly has her period and doesn't consummate the relationship. Of course if you have ever watched a Wolfgang Bld film before you know this is far from the last twist. Terrible band dubbing.

Sex, full frontal nudity, sleep rape (Fiona Horsey) If you enjoy Fiona Horsey films there is a 12 pack called Blood Bath which features 3 of her movies.",1324598400,,1240,4.65296803652968
2830974,5,B000Q66QCE,"Great.  Even my MOTHER liked this, in fact she wanted to watch it AGAIN!  Fiona Horsey is SO HOT...and the storyline and the ending were things of sheer genius.  I kinda am interested in what other things Wolfgang Buld has directed.",1251763200,,232,4.609756097560975
2830975,4,B000Q66QCE,"We all know how modern women treat us, men, and this movie proves it all the way to the end. Luckily its only movies where we pay ultimate price for thinking with... ehhh / I wonder if word dick is ok / but anyway the movie is plain perfect. My only complain is we do not see  female's actress main private parts but I am sure it will happen sooner or later.",1215820800,,358,3.9722222222222223

8194300,3,B000Q66QCE,It was ok. Almost comical without intending to be....,1463270400,,53,5.0
8194301,5,B000Q66QCE,An independent British film and horror movie without the blood and gore of American movies. Interesting characters and original story plot made this a suspenseful movie with plenty of twists and turns. Fiona Horsey was amazing. Sorry she hasn't made more than a handful of films. I was thoroughly entertained by this movie and will no doubt watch it again or buy it on DVD.,1456531200,,373,4.753846153846154
8194302,1,B000Q66QCE,"Completely baffled by all of the high ratings for this movie.  I thought from the first few minutes it was going to be 'cheesy,' but because of the reviews I stuck with it.  I can usually find Some redeeming qualities in most anything, but am having a hard time with this movie.  Do Not let the cover pic make you think that it is any indication of what the movie is about.  It is Not.",1454630400,,385,4.093333333333334

8194306,1,B000Q66QCE,It was not a Horror movie just a crappy B movie filled with soft porn a waste of time !,1420070400,,87,3.4
8194307,5,B000Q66QCE,"This is a foreign language film that doesn't need subtitles. It has British youth in trouble, driving on the wrong side of the road and an interesting story line. It is at times creepy and suspenseful, has a body count but does not have exceedingly graphic displays of violence as a majority of American made drama and suspense films have today. Violence in the movie is similar to that in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho except that this movie is in color. Despite the lack of violence you may not want to watch with the kids as while there is a lack of graphic violence this films makers did not have the same aversion to nudity. This film has several scenes with Fiona Horsey topless and a few shots of total nudity. Language may be an issue too but how can you tell, the cute British accent and their reserved nature it is hard to tell when anyone is really mad.",1417219200,2,860,4.415094339622642
8194308,5,B000Q66QCE,"When I realize that ""all's fair in love & war"" transcends the status of clich and is a genuine law observed by most folks in our society, a lot of things became quite clear to me, including how it is that NO members of the previous presidential administration are behind bars, but I digress.
It's the love half of the equation I'm addressing here. Because this movie is all about the evil stuff we do with each other when we're in love, and I'm maki no nice distinctions here between love & list. Because it's a mix of both that drives the ugly events of this movie (yes, that IS what I'm talking about) from the soliciting of quickie sex from a chambermaid, a lie about robbery, a lie about rape, faked sex, faked love, actual rape, faked pregnancy. Makes you feel like there's bugs in your GI tract, and that feeling is an ewy-icky-awesome reason to watch a GREAT revenge film!",1414195200,,879,4.432098765432099
