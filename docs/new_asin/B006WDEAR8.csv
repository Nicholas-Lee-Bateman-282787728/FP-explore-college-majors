8505540,5,B006WDEAR8,"In October, 2010, a worker bulldozing a reservoir outside of Snowmass, Colorado finds some large bones that turn out to be those of a mammoth. A team headed by experts from the Denver Museum of Nature & Science unearth more mammoth bones, as well as many more of mastodon, some representatives of an extinct species of bison, and specimens of other varieties of Ice Age megafauna, dating from 45,000 to 150,000 years ago. The find is a mixed blessing, as the researchers are put in the odd situation of having to rush the excavation of the find of a lifetime.

From the scientists involved (and with the help of some adequate CGI), the viewer receives a crash course in the ecology of Pleistocene North America, the science behind ice ages in general, and the evolution of this particular site over tens of thousands of years--from lake, to bog, to meadow. The team (which includes experts in geology, paleontology, paleobotany, and evolutionary biology) examines several lines of evidence, concluding that the mass grave is probably the result of ""liquefaction"" from earthquakes sucking heavy beasts into the lake bed. But for all they learn about the site, new questions arise. Why are all the bones those of herbivores, without even any signs of scavenging on the bodies? Where are the predators and scavengers? Where are the saber-toothed cats, short-faced bears, and dire wolves?

And what of the 40,000-year-old mammoth covered in seemingly out-of-place boulders? It reminds at least one of the scientists involved of a known method ancient hunters used to cache large kills at the bottoms of lakes. Additionally, one of these bones has marks on it that don't seem consistent with gnawing or contact with rocks. Could humans have been there, thousands of years before our species is supposed to have discovered this continent? Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence... and, frankly, I'm unconvinced. But the hypothesis is intriguing, nonetheless.

NOVA's ""Ice Age Death Trap"" is yet another quality presentation from PBS.",1377648000,,2040,5.157099697885196
8505541,3,B006WDEAR8,"""Ice Age Death Trap"" is a very respectable PBS-National Geographic documentary and part of the NOVA science series. It follows a group of excavators at Snowmass in Colorado, as they are unearthing ancient mammal fossils from the bottom of an old lake. Most of the stuff shown is pretty conventional. If you're first love is mastodon bones, brace yourself for a treat.

The program is topped off by a sensational find: a mammoth carcass which seems to have been anchored to the bottom of the lake by boulders. This was standard practice among Paleo-Indians, but there is one problem: the mammoth remains are believed to be over 40,000 years old. However, according to conventional wisdom, humans didn't reach the Americas until about 15,000 years ago. Weirdly, this find is not discussed at the official site of the dig, the Snowmastodon Project. Too hot?

Since mastodons frankly aren't my cup of tea (or first love), I found ""Ice Age Death Trap"" pretty boring, until the pre-Clovis discovery. Fortean honey traps can show up in the most unexpected of places. Even at Snowmass, Colorado.",1375920000,,1087,4.967032967032967
8505542,5,B006WDEAR8,"I live near Snowmass Village Co. Went to see the dig and asked about a CD, the office recommended this CD and it's wonderful. I can't believe that I found it on Amazon! Thanks.",1363478400,,176,4.205882352941177
8505543,5,B006WDEAR8,"A fantastic dvd on the snowmass site, I felt like I was participating on the excavation! an absolute must have for anyone
with an interest in the american mastodon or the ice age period.",1361232000,,186,4.5
8505544,5,B006WDEAR8,"The DVD was an excellent program about an archaeological dig done in Snowmas , colorado , where many prehistoric animal bones were unearthed in an ancient lake bed. The program , Ice Age Death Trap , was very interesting and infomative. I really enjoyed it!",1361145600,,257,4.733333333333333
8505545,5,B006WDEAR8,"A construction crew building a small dam near Snowmass, CO. unearths two large mammoth bones, and experts are called in. Fortunately they are given a period of time to dig through the area. They find several layers of prehistoric bones, including mammoths, giant buffalo and bears, and giant sloths. Strangely, there were no predator bones found. The bones date back 150,000 years - the experts theorize that the large animals sank into the sand during earthquakes and then could not extract themselves, starving to death. Over 4,000 bones were collected in a six-week period. Most surprising was finding cut marks on some bones - suggesting the existence of humans using cutting stones to utilize the meat in the top layer where the bones were also found with stones seemingly used to kill the animals. That top layer was dated back to about 40,000 years ago - about 20,000 years prior to prior earliest evidence of man in North America.",1339027200,3,938,4.90566037735849
