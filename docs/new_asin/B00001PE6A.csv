7914661,3,B00001PE6A,"OK so first off these videos even on dvd are very old. Meaning that they transfered to dvd as best it could. NOT bad. The films shake a little at times. But the girls or models are very attractive and bring back a good sense of nostalgia. The price isn't bad. Also the scenes are not really explicit, you must remember that this was filmed like 50 plus years ago and what was considered raunchy and sleezy back then would now be labled pg-13. I had fun watching these films, and the models do their share of teasing and baring all at times but greatest feeling I got was what the good old days used to be like and I liked them even for a guy like me who is 30 years old.",1327017600,4,670,4.045112781954887
7914662,2,B00001PE6A,"'The Napoleonic Wars' is appropriately concise at under an hour, but as such it fails to cover its topic thoroughly enough. While it contains fairly detailed information with respect to the most famous battles of the Napoleonic Era, Austerlitz and Waterloo, other equally important periods in Napoleon's military career are mentioned only briefly, such as his conquest of Egypt in 1798. Other events are left out entirely, including his Italian campaign in 1796 (I realize that this campaign was not actually a part of those traditionally considered the Napoleonic Wars, but it is nonetheless relevant to the subject).
Also, much of the information in the video is presented in such a way that it seems those who made it assumed the viewer already had some knowledge of the Napoleonic Wars. As a result, this video would make a poor choice as introductory material; at the same time, it's too basic to successfully contribute much knowledge to someone who already has a decent knowledge of the Napoleonic Wars. Its usefulness to me was limited to merely refreshing my memory of a few names, dates, and places.
""Caveat emptor.""  For a comprehensive look at the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere.",984960000,4,1192,5.050761421319797
