8520191,5,B007P6IW1G,"The appropriately titled, Visions, provides a retrospective and present day glimpse into the life and work of Catherine Andrews, a gifted visionary artist. There are two sections to the DVD, which was co-produced by Catherine and Christopher Toussaint. The first is a nearly hour long documentary and the second is a 36 minute ""music art gallery.""  The first part of the documentary was filmed at showings of her paintings at various galleries in the Los Angeles area. In the opening scene, Catherine is actually working on a painting while people are observing and viewing her art show. This is interspersed with interviews of attendees who share their perspectives on Catherine's work. There are also times when Catherine takes the microphone and discusses particular paintings, relating what they mean to her and what the inspiration was. One thing that I was not aware of is the fact that Catherine is also a stained glass artist and her work in this medium is stunning.

The subject matter of Catherine's paintings covers a wide spectrum, yet there is always an aura of spirituality that pervades. One facet of her work reflects elements of romanticism. Mythology and fantasy also play a part and include knights and maidens, fairies, nature spirits, magical gardens, mythical creatures such as Pegasus and more. Providing glimpses into other dimensions is central to Catherine's work and continuing along the thematic spectrum are mystical visions of heavenly realms and ethereal planes of existence, angels, Goddesses, enlightened beings, and more. The second part of the DVD, the ""music art gallery"" provides a continuous flow of Catherine's artwork, some of which is animated by special effects and set to a soundtrack of her own celestial music from an album she recorded called ""Initiation."" I've long been a fan of Catherine Andrews and I enjoyed gaining a deeper perspective about her as the talented artist and beautiful person that she is.",1345680000,,1954,5.160883280757098
