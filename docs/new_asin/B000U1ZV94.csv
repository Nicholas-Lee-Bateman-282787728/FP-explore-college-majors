2915316,4,B000U1ZV94,"The movies are from an era when I was frist became awear martial arts.  The movies brought me to time of youth pass time.  There was two excellent movie that I have been look for and I found them on this disc ""prodigal boxer and moonlight sword.""  The martial art (flight scene) was excellent, but the english subtitle needs more word by the film company.",1389571200,,355,4.430769230769231

2915319,4,B000U1ZV94,"If you're a fan like me of martial arts films this is a good little collection.  I wanted it for the Brandon Lee film and for ""Bloodsport"" but was happy to get the other two with it.  It's a bit odd that the DVDs aren't marked well so it took me a while to figure out where the freaking movie was.  But I did and they were all great.",1373068800,,333,3.7971014492753623
2915320,3,B000U1ZV94,"These movies are great but the specs on the back of the dvd case is wrong. It claims to have wide-screen versions of Rumble In The Bronx and The Corruptor, and that there are extras such as biographies, trailers, commentaries, and music video. That is wrong. I have listed the correct specs below:

Rumble In The Bronx...
picture format: Full-Screen
soundtracks: English 5.1, English 2.0
subtitles: English, Spanish
extras: none

The Corruptor...
picture format: Full-Screen
soundtracks: English 5.1, English 2.0
subtitles: English, Spanish
extras: none

Showdown In Little Tokyo...
picture format: Full-Screen
soundtracks: English 2.0
subtitles: English
extras: none

Bloodsport...
picture format: Wide-Screen
soundtracks: English 2.0, French 1.0
subtitles: English, French, Japanese
extras: Cast & Crew Filmography, Theatrical Trailer

This set is a combination of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rumble-In-The-Bronx-The-Corruptor/dp/B0009UZFZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rumble In The Bronx/The Corruptor</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Showdown-in-Little-Tokyo-Bloodsport/dp/B000E8QVCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Showdown in Little Tokyo/Bloodsport</a>&nbsp;since Rumble In The Bronx and The Corruptor are on a one-sided disc while Bloodsport and Showdown In Little Tokyo is on a double-sided flipper disc. If you can get this set cheap, it's not bad for the wide-screen Bloodsport and if you don't care about having Rumble In The Bronx and The Corruptor in full-screen and without any extras. Otherwise, stick to stand-alone releases.",1295136000,16,1638,7.089108910891089
2915321,2,B000U1ZV94,"The back of the dvd box clear states that 3 of the movies are presented in widescreen format yet when I played those movies all of them are in fullscreen with no option that I can find to play the movies in widescreen, which I prefer, so don't buy this item unless your ok with fullscreen format. Just wish I knew this before I bought the set.",1278115200,12,343,4.134328358208955
2915322,4,B000U1ZV94,"These are not classics in my opinion but they are good solid martial arts films.  The two discs in the set I received were labeled WIDESCREEN on the discs and played nicely on my dvd player and HDTV once I selected a good screen format.  You can get this at a great price through Amazon sellers.

Here are summarized descriptions based on the back cover of the dvd:

MILITANT EAGLE: A soldier returning home joins forces with villagers seeking justice after their families are brutally slain.

THE PRODIGAL BOXER: Fei Meng plays Fong Sai-Yuk, beloved hero of Chinese lore.

MOONLIGHT SWORD AND JADE LION: Mao Yin (Angela Mao) is a woman on a heroic quest to find her teacher's missing brother.

THE BLOODY FISTS: Yuen Wo Peng stages the tale of a fugitive loner defending a village against marauders.

These are English language versions so no subtitles or original language unfortunately.",1264723200,8,889,4.841059602649007
