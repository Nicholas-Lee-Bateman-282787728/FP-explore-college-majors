7863217,5,6304140959,"After seeing some clips from Roots of Country on YouTube I wanted to see the whole series. This six-hour series greatly exceeded my expectations. I produce live music shows and am always doing research into the history of different music styles. The content of the Roots of Country was rich with historical information supplemented with scores of interviews and performance footage. The series covers country music from its early rural beginnings through the modern country of the mid 1990s. None of the video was the least bit boring. In fact, it kept my interest during the entire series and I will certainly watch it again.

With the eventual disappearance of available VHS players, I hope the producers release the series on DVD so that more people will be able to enjoy it.",1300924800,5,778,4.893939393939394
