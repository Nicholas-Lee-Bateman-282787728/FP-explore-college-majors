1779280,1,B00006JDQN,"It really missed the mark and I was very disappointed and that's a shame because I so looked foreward to it. The serious problem was that they seemed to miss the idea of the book (LeGuin did not consult on the production) and made Dr Haber a power hungry guy which is true but in the book, despite his becomining more powerful and bigger, he does want to create a better world. Lisa Bonet is really not mature enough as an actress to play Heather Lalashe, I'm sorry she just can't pull it off. Plot wise, they skipped what a good 2/3 of the book! I really think they should have had a few of the changed worlds, they totally missed the plague that wiped out 5 billion people, the dropped the aliens, everyone turning gray. THe whole concept that if you change one thing everything changes. Get the 1980 PBS version, much better, more fun. Though, I did like Manny in this version, I have to admit. But they aliens never exist so he nevetr gets called Jor Jor (George Orr).....",1031616000,5,976,4.368131868131868

If you are a true fan of the book, buy the pbs version instead of this one.",1031616000,6,479,4.053191489361702
1779282,1,B00006JDQN,"This new version of the legendary PBS movie is a total waste of time. It's awefull. It's boring, slow, dull, and worse of all: NO ALIENS!!!! How could they leave out the aliens?

1779283,2,B00006JDQN,"One of my all time memories from my teen-age years was my sister sitting me down to watch the 1980 version of The Lathe of Heaven. She was a huge Ursula K. LeGuin fan and was always trying to engage my brain with something cool. So I watched and was totally blown away by it all. I always carried a torch for that particular production, because it broke the cool barrier. Yes, the special effects sucked, but I forgave it because the story was just so damned good. It left such an indelible impression on my brain that I later bought a first edition of the book and bought the 1980 version DVD when it was finally released a few years ago.

So, I was absolutely excited when A&E announced that they were going to do their own version of The Lathe of Heaven. And, to add to my excitement, James Caan (Sonny Corleone Himself!) was going to play the part of Haber. It just had to be great, good actors, excellent source material, and updated special effects.

Not so much. . . . Not in practice, anyway. The special effects are great and most of the individual actors (Lukas Haas and the absolutely babelicious Lisa Bonet) are quite good in their roles. (Surprisingly, James Caan definitely sucked in his role). However, the ensemble just totally lacked a spark. It was very flat. Also, the story strayed greatly from the original source material, making all kinds of changes to character arcs that were entirely unncessary. (Why was it necessary to make Heather LeLache have a husband in some of the alternate worlds?)

I just got the feeling that the producers took great liberties with an almost perfect story (the 1980 version stays almost Chapter and Verse to the original), just for the sake of being different. And therein lies the problem. I don't have a problem with making changes to a story in order to make it work within a particular medium. For example, The Hunt for Red October was simplified considerably to make the movie. That makes sense, because the story is byzantine enough to be difficult to follow in the visual medium. It wasn't necessary in this instance.

So, in a nutshell, don't buy this version of the movie. You'll be disappointed. Buy the 1980 version that was made for PBS, and I guarantee you'll be much happier. Yes, the effects suck, but it has heart. I just showed it to a friend of mine last week, and they absolutely loved it. Or better yet, read the book. It's LeGuin's best.",1031616000,4,2412,4.563510392609699
1779284,1,B00006JDQN,"If you want to see a movie about a strange man having a love affair with his lawyer while his Evil doctor attempts to have him locked up, this is the story for you.
...There is nothing good about this A&E version, except perhaps the fact that it ends.",1031616000,5,251,4.142857142857143
1779285,1,B00006JDQN,"Up front, I gotta say that 1) the original was one of my fav SF movies, 2) I have not seen the DVD, but I did attempt to watch this movie on its A&E debut last night (Sept. 8th), and it was so bad I turned it off after the first hour.
This movie fails on many levels.  It's horribly slow moving.  Deathly dull, in fact.  Some of the actors are terribly annoying.  Lisa Bonet is fine to look at, but she's one level: a sexy whispered voice at all times, and so carries no authority whatsoever.  She doesn't seem smart enough to be a lawyer.  She was so badly cast and is such a worthless actress that I wanted to shout at the TV every time she came onscreen.  Lukas Haas is okay, as are James Caan and David Straithairn, but the doctor's secretary is annoyingly shrill.  Except for the badly cast Lisa Bonet, though, I blame the director whenever good actors are less-than-good in a movie.
Even the music is bad.  The composer is a big-name guy who did music for Twin Peaks (among many other fine credits), but his music seemed very out of place.  It seemed like the director attempted to inject some life into deadly-dull scenes through the energy of the music, but it seemed mismatched entirely.
My expectations were low, to be honest.  Rarely does a re-make do justice, I thought coming into this.  But even my low expectations were not met.  Oh, the sets and costuming were good, but overall this was a waste of a good SF idea and some decent actors.  Don't bother with this one - get the original!",1031529600,9,1501,4.333333333333333

PBS version from the early 80's. While the first version was
a wonderfully crafted adaptaion of the original story, this
is a maudline love story that never rises above the mundane.
I saw a special preview of this movie at the recent World
SF convention. I went to see it thinking it was the same
""Lathe of Heaven"" that I had seen on PBS 20 years ago. A movie
so powerful that although I saw it only the once I still remember
it well. I was thrilled at the chance to see it again. I was
so very disappointed.

1779297,2,B00006JDQN,"I am a fan of the original 1980 version and also read the book.  I knew this was going to be different, which meant I went into this with an open mind.  Even with an open mind I was pretty disappointed in this version.

First off, it started off fairly slowly. I would have had no idea of what was going on if I wasn't familiar with the story line.

This is another one of those remakes where they miss the point of the original.

In fact, they should have totally gone away from the Lathe of Heaven story for this and turned it more into a type of Twilight Zone episode as another reviewer said.

My final reaction to this was ""hunh?""  I have no real idea of what happened, unlike the original.  Thinking of that I will give this 2 stars instead of 3.

1779300,5,B00006JDQN,"I am pretty appalled at the incredible amount of reviews here that give this movie one star out of five and decries it as ultimately execrable. That's not true at all. Saying that it omits a lot of things from the book is not a valid criticism; there is no book ever filmed that contained all of the book's substance. Saying that the 2002 film is inferior to the 1980 is a matter of personal preference; I actually prefer the new one.

What matters in science fiction is the grandness of the central idea, and the one in Lathe of Heaven is not only grand but also deeply artistic. It's a great classic, and the core essence of the book is entirely preserved in this great and straightforward production which knows what it's doing. I hope posterity will see reason and not listen to the legion of hateful naysayers.",1307836800,3,815,4.469798657718121
1779301,3,B00006JDQN,"Other reviewers have put this film through the thresher, but I wished to add a couple of points:
 1) Lukas Haas's understated performance is perfect for the character; anyone in that position would have learned to be subdued, or else. Most of the other actors follow suit, which makes for a smarter film.
 2) This DVD is a great example of why WIDESCREEN is not the same as ANAMORPHIC. This widescreen disc shows up both letter-boxed and pillar-boxed. If you zoom in on the central image, definition collapses to something like standard def (awful). Hardly a great film, but an enjoyable enough experience if you take it on its own terms, and deserving of a better DVD than this dreadful thing.",1263427200,,694,4.7272727272727275

I tried all the visible links on this screen, none of them had anything to do with closed captioning. There is no relevant link anywhere you can click on at all with the remote (the iMac comes with a DVD/movie remote) that has anything to do with closed captioning. I have watched many movie DVDs with closed captioning on my iMac and know how to easily turn on this feature using the remote. I find the ""CC"" icon marking on the rear jacket of this DVD to be mystifying and extremely misleading.

1779304,1,B00006JDQN,"This movie has very little in common with the novel.  It's like the adapters read the summary on the back of the LeGuin novel book jacket and decided that was all they needed to do to write the screenplay.  I bought this for $3.99 as a previously viewed DVD at Blockbuster and I can definitely see why they were removing it from their stock.  Do not waste your money on this piece of s**t.

1779305,1,B00006JDQN,"If you want to see, enjoy and appreciate the marvelous story Lathe of Heaven by Ursula K. Lequin then either read the book or watch the 1980 film production.  Either option will give you the inestimable advantage of a presentation of the story, its underlying ideas and its characters.  The film version also treats you to excellent performances that present actual characters from the novel, in character and all the essential details and concepts of the author's excellent novel with a no worse than merely adequate visual realization that belies the budget constraints of the production.

The version reviewed here dispenses with most of that annoying and pedantic fidelity to the author's work and in return gives you ... James Caan.  That is about it.  There is a stray mention of effective dreams and other coincidental relationships to the original work, but that is about it.  What I believe to be the ultimate discovery that breaks Dr. Haber in the end is completely absent as are most of the key episodes and consequences of Dr. Haber's study of George Orr and his effective dreams.

If this were the ONLY version on film it would still be a dismal failure.  Poor adaptations of novels, especially novels with highly intellectual content, are a commonplace.  But there is another film version that is excellent in writing and acting, and looks good despite its budget.

Re-imagining? De-imagining is more accurate.  A handful of favorable reviews (there IS a reason for the paucity of them) seek to justify this misshapen effort's existence on ""its own merits"".  A movie that uses the title and reputation of a well known work, especially one that has been produced in the same medium before, does not get the luxury of being only evaluated in a vacuum by the ignorant.  It must either present a worthy rendering of that work, or present a ""re-visioning"" (1) of such merit that the changes made are well justified.  This production does neither and the effects are no great shakes either.  This thing compares to the real thing about like a new production of Hamlet, still using Shakespeare's name, set in a gay bathhouse using maybe three lines of the original script compares to a production of Shakespeare's Hamlet.

You have been warned, this thing is for completists only.

==================
(1) ""re-visioning"" n. Euphemism for a director's ego in place of good writing combined with a big, big CGI budget and a usually a huge promotion before release aimed at a public that does not give a rodential back end about anything but action, effects and hot boys or babes in (or out) of tight costumes.",1215561600,8,2613,4.875565610859729

What is worth keeping?

I agree with other reviewers who say this movie appeals to the thinkers.  This is the kind of film that stamps an archetype in one's mind; one finds oneself comparing other plots to the Lathe of Heaven.

If you want ninety minutes fistfights, car chases, cursin', and killin', you'll be dissappointed by this film.  If you enjoy films that play with your concept of reality (e.g. Matrix, The Visitors), you may enjoy this film.",1161907200,7,796,4.628571428571429

This version of ""The Lathe of Heaven"" stands alone from the book (you don't need to read the book to understand the movie). The characters and plot are deep and moving.

Granted, since it's an A&E production, I wasn't expecting it to be first rate, and it certainly isn't.  In terms of production quality, the movie is quite good.  The story, on the other hand, although an interesting concept, really was somewhat dry and predictable.  The dialogue was kind of lame at times, too.

1779322,1,B00006JDQN,"It would be easy to dismiss Le Guin's novel as unfilmable, except for the fact that it has already been done and done well, managing to capture the subtleties of shifting histories and universes without having to rely on adding melodramatic subplots or spelling out blatantly what was handled with style and grace in the text.
All of which is a roundabout way to say that you can't watch this movie without comparing it with either the 1980 film or with the original novel and that this version is extremely disappointing.  Nuance is replaced with blatant acting and a heavy handed score, slow discoveries replaced by melodrama and all humanity reduced to the emotions of a soap opera.
While it's obvious that many changes would have to be made in order to turn a fairly cerebral novel into an accessible movie, the changes made to this are extremely disappointing and I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone on any level.

1779323,3,B00006JDQN,"The Lathe of Heaven refers to the dreams of George Orr, a seemingly ordinary young man whose dreams shape the waking reality of the world.  In fact, his dreams change the entire past, present and future history in such a way that only he and his puzzling friend Manny seem to have any memory of an alternate past after he awakens.  Afraid that he may dream some horrible fate upon the world, George turns to drugs for dream suppression --- only to overdose and earn himself court-ordered therapy with appointed psychiatrist Dr. Haber.
Haber starts out with the best intentions, but as their dream therapy sessions progress he finds himself believing Orr's fantastic claims, and temptation leads him to manipulate George's dreams for his own advancement.  George soon catches on to what his doctor is doing, confronts him, and sets in motion a race not only for his own freedom but the future of humanity.
TLOH works on the level of a psychological thriller rather than action-based science fiction.  A somewhat surrealistic atmosphere underlies every scene, leading us to question whether or not each incarnation of reality after Geoorge wakes may be yet another extension of his dreaming.  The philosophical questions provoked by George's unique situation (Is all reality but a dream? Is Manny even a  real person? Is George the defacto God of his universe?) have an unmistakable existentialist slant.
I admit to never having read the novel by Ursula K. LeGuin upon which TLOH is based.  Therefore, I approached this made for cable TV adaptation with no particular expectations.  I thought it was well done for what it was, although by no means could it compete with a high-budget feature film production.  Still, the small cast of main actors were exceptionally well chosen for their roles:  James Caan was comfortable as Dr. Haber and convinced me that he may well have been a psychologist in another life; Lukas Haas was the perfect innocent; Lisa Bonet, while playing the same character type as always, really seemed suited to the role of coolly mysterious attorney/ dream girl Heather LaLache.  In all, the cheerless gray future of @ 30 years from now is realized very plausibly, mainly through set and wardrobe design, with little attempt at ""sci-fi-isms"" such as robot servants or aliens (which I understand made an appearance in the original version).
If you can suspend your disbelief and appreciate toned-down, philosophical science fiction, you will be able to enjoy the Lathe of Heaven.

1779324,5,B00006JDQN,"Having never read the novel this story is based on or seen the 1980s version, I was really surprised with the depth of story and the well-crafted presentation of this psychological film. (I give it my highest compliment... it really does seem like a story Philip K. Dick would have written.)
When he dreams, George Orr's dreams alter reality.  Controlling reality is harder than you'd expect.  George blames himself for all the evils of the world and his attempts to rectify things always have unforeseen consequences.
Obviously for the film much thought was given to creating just the right atmosphere for several unique versions of our future society.  (Multiple viewings will reveal how well the costumes, characters and set design evolve together throughout the story.  The bonus material also adds some new spins.)
I love the ending here, it's open to much interpretation, however finding anyone who has seen the film to discuss it with is hard to do.
Keep your eyes on Manny!  His every line is rich with meaning.  My favorite is this one, ""Believing what you know to be true and nobody else does doesn't make you crazy.  Looney maybe.""",1045958400,8,1142,4.8860103626943
1779325,3,B00006JDQN,"The Arts and Entertainment channel decided to revisit Ursula K. Le Guin's science fiction classic, and their version premiered on television in 2002. The tendency is to want to compare this movie to the 1980 version or to the book, which ultimately casts it in an unfavorable light. Judged on its own merits, however, it is actually not too bad.
This movie still contains the basic premise of George Orr attempting to find a cure for his dreams that effective reality. The first half of the A&E version actually follows the book fairly closely. However, this movie almost completely dispenses with Dr. Haber's attempts to use George's power to bring the greatest good to the greatest number. In fact, Dr. Haber manipulates Georges power mostly for his own gain. Several aspects of the book and the original movie are completely left out, such as the alien invasion and their subsequent interaction with the characters. Instead, this movie focuses more on the relationship with George Orr and Heather Lelache. George continues to dream new realities in which he meets Heather again and again in a seemingly never-ending unfulfilled romance.
In this respect A&E's version of The Lathe of Heaven is like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits. And in this respect, it is a decent, though not spectacular, movie. It disappoints, however, when compared to the original movie and the book. Though James Caan does a good Dr. Haber, Lukas Haas adds nothing to the character of George Orr, and Lisa Bonet, as Heather Lelache, seems to fade into the background in most scenes. In addition, much of the original story's observation on the use and misuse of power is lost in what is essentially a quaint love story.",1044403200,20,1725,4.890784982935154

This adaptation is also about a man who changes reality with his dreams, but beyond that any semblance to the original story is purely coincidental. The acting is somnambulistic and insipid.

The writer ignores the philosophical and religious undertones of the novel -- captured beautifully in the earlier PBS production -- and prefers a monolithic, one-dimensional telling of a completely different story with entirely different characters, motives and consequences.

The acting, if you can call it that, is likewise monolithic and uninspired.  Particularly disappointing were Cann and Haas, the main protagonists.  Lisa Bonet attempts to rescue some scenes, but the wooden acting by Haas spoils her efforts.  The one inspired element of the production, the scenes with David Strathairn's Mannie, is left useless by a lack of reason or context for the character's apparent knowledge.  It doesn't help that in the original book and movie this role was filled by one of the space aliens, dreamed up by main character.  In the A&E production Mannie is left hanging on a vine unattached to any other of the story's branches.  The whole effect is one of confusion instead of focussing on the thought provoking ideas presented in both the original novel and PBS's far superior production.

My advice is to ignore this turkey.  Buy the book and read it, or if you must view a video production, go with the inspired 1980
PBS production.  This A&E production is shallow, uninspired and totally without merit when compared with the other sources.

Point blank: a BIG disappointment.  It makes the original TV movie look phenomenal.  Here's why:

In 1980, PBS funded its first made for TV movie: The Lathe of Heaven.  It probably didn't have a big budget, but the acting was very good and the production quite thoughtful.  They really did a lot with little.  Sure, the special effects are primitive compared with today's computer generated effects, but they did work.  Ursula Le Guin came up with a great story that deserves a decent movie incarnation.  But somehow, the folks at A&E really blew it with this updated version.

The acting is shockingly below average.  James Caan, an award winning actor, seems to have done this piece as a half-hearted favor to Haas and didn't put his talent into it.  Most of the time you expect him to fall asleep, given his mumbly, low monotone conversations.  Lukas Haas unjustly portrays Orr as a severely weak pushover, with no spark of life in him.  He is ""humdrum"" about everything (a Haas trademark?), and you find it difficult to identify with him unless your life is confined to a cardboard box.  Lisa Bonet also has this ""sedated"" personna in Heather, but that might be because she realizes that her character is completely unbelievable and she has so little to work with.

The script is too far off the mark.  The writer completely missed the driving points of the Lathe of Heaven novel by Ursula K. LeGuin.  The whole concept of ""The Greatest Good for the Greatest Number"", striving to play God for humanity, is completely lost.  Only George Orr remains true to the agenda portrayed in the book, to stop himself from having dreams that change reality.  Dr. Haber tries to use George for his own benefit, but in this remake he shows no lofty goals for humanity, trying to ""make the world RIGHT"".  Heather Lelache just drifts through the story aimlessly, as if on drugs.

There is a painful lack of special effects too.  You see some nice examples of special effects scattered about, but in places where they are sorely needed there is nothing.  Also, key aspects of the book are completely ignored, perhaps because they didn't want to risk trying to imitate the effects (5 billion people die from the plague, aliens attack, etc.).

In short, there is no good reason to see this movie, UNLESS you are a Lathe of Heaven fanatic and want to see this for comparison purposes.  Even still, it is PAINFUL to watch.  The only benefit is that it makes you appreciate that charming low budget original TV movie--The Lathe of Heaven is a great story and I'm so glad it is finally available on DVD (it was not available on any commercial media for many, many years--you just had to be fortunate enough to have taped the original PBS broadcast or obtained a copy of that from a friend).

If you search the Internet for ""James Caan"" and ""Lathe of Heaven"", you'll find a few reviews posted on various websites, most of which are kind to the film with no real basis, so don't be quick to believe them.

1779358,1,B00006JDQN,"I am not someone who insists that a movie adhere strictly to the book on which it is based.  Moreover, I recognize that a teleplay must omit some parts of the book in order to fit in an 80-minute timeframe.  However, I expect the essential theme of the book to be maintained.  This adaptation fails miserably in that respect.
Rather than paint a picture of the futility of playing God, director Philip Haas chose to give us a one-dimensional clich&eacute; of the self-aggrandizing scientist (James Caan's Dr. Haber) and us a shallow love story.  Haber's desire to mold a better world through George Orr's power, his attempt to convince George to join him in the effort rather than resist, and his inability to see that the consequences of meddling with reality are unpredictable -- all of this is lost in Haas' adaptation.  Instead, we see Haber using George to obtain successively more magnificent office space and a progressively more fashionable secretary. George's love interest, Heather, is reduced to an odd obsession; Heather's own attempt (and failure) in LeGuin's novel to use George's power for public good never appears in Haas' film.
Perhaps the pettiest departure from the book was Haas' choice to have Dr. Haber say ""New York"" (instead of ""Antwerp"") as the phrase that induces George Orr's dreams under hypnosis in their first session.  Interestingly, Haber never uses the phrase again in any of the subsequent dream scenes.  Maybe Haas was embarrassed by his own pettiness.
Even as a standalone movie, this film is a poor one.  Lisa Bonet's character, Heather, was completely unbelievable.  Are we really supposed to accept that a successful and self-assertive lawyer will drive out to a remote location and jump into bed with a psychiatric patient about whom she knows very little and that she will remain there with him for days in the face of his increasingly obsessive behavior - simply because he says he feels he knew her from a previous life?  In another scene, we are given hints that George's friend, Manny, may be more than he seems.  He appears in each of George's realities, and he seems to recall all of them.  Yet Haas does nothing with this.  The final scenes are rushed and confusing, leaving the viewer with the sense that Haas simply ended the show in order to fit into the time he had available.
Philip Haas has not made a decent movie since his 1995 ""Angels and Insects.""  This version of ""The Lathe of Heaven"" continues his streak of losers. If you want to see a good film adaptation of LeGuin's book, buy the 1980 PBS version instead.",1032134400,10,2571,4.800453514739229

1779360,1,B00006JDQN,"Having loved the acclaimed PBS production, I was intrigued to see a new adaptation - but, sadly, this one elicits big yawns, not dreams.  First, this is a radically different telling of the story - so which is the faithful adaptation?  I understand that would be the 1980 version.  Secondly, not expecting this to mimic the original, I still expect it to sustain my interest and tell a satisfying, coherent story - yet James Caan and Lisa Bonet genuinely appear to sleepwalk through their performances.  (Doubt that was intended as an homage to the ""dream"" theme.)  Third, David Straithairn is always capable, but expanding his role does little to help the story.  Fourth, Angelo Baladamenti is a gifted composer but I felt his musical score actually bickered with the story mood in some scenes.  Fifth, unlike the 1980 PBS adaptation - which compels the viewer's attention, is tightly constructed, and progressively and logically draws to an inevitable and novel resolution - this new story line seems to meander.  Sixth, in the closing scene, Lisa Bonet's and Lukas Haas' eloqution was so languid and sloppy, I actually had to turn on subtitles to understand their spoken dialogue.  Thus, I actively denounce this ""Lathe"" as anything but ""heavenly.""  Another reviewer mentioned having to rewatch the 1980 version to ""get over it""; interestingly, I, too, felt that need - and was thrilled to see how beautifully it held up - far and away, the version to see and treasure.",1031875200,6,1472,4.9471544715447155
1779361,1,B00006JDQN,"In 1980 PBS broadcast an adaptation of Ursula Le Guin's novel ""The Lathe of Heaven"", made with the close cooperation of Le Guin herself. The movie was an instant cult classic, and its subsequent 20-year disappearance from the airwaves only heightened its legend.
In 2002 A&E broadcast a new version called ""Lathe of Heaven"". The director boasted that he hadn't read the book nor watched the movie. And Ms. Le Guin was not consulted at any time in the process of making the movie.
The result? A brainless, gutless, pointless waste of time. So much of the plot from the book and PBS movie were discarded that no real plot remains. The aliens? Gone. The twisting effect of manipulated dreaming? Gone. The conflict between passive and active world-views, between Tao and technology? Gone. The tragedy of good intentions gone hopelessly awry? Gone. Well-written dialog, good acting, a coherent storyline? Gone, gone, and - yes, you guessed it - gone.
The novel and original PBS film were brilliant reflections on the nature of reality and existence, with plot twists that packed an emotional as well as an intellectual wallop and with involving, three-dimensional characters that you could care about. The A&E version replaces all that with a bit of hot tongue action between Lisa Bonet and Lucas Haas.
And it's not even GOOD hot tongue action.
Look, if you're looking for hot tongue action, go buy or rent some honest-to-goodness p0rn. It'll have more integrity than this A&E abomination.

I love the 1980 version, but it isn't flawless.  It's low budget, and the nuclear war stuff they threw in is pretty confusing.
The climax of the book can only truly be transposed to film through very, very, expensive special effects.  The 1980 film does an admirable job, but I'd love to see Spielberg or Lucas take a crack at the special effects.
As great as the 1980 version is, I feel that the definitive movie adaptation of the book has yet to be made.
The 2002 version is an embarrasment.  They did a very good job with the costumes and the hair.  James Caan does a good job, with what little he has to work with.  Lisa Bonet and the guy who plays George Orr are ok.
But the teleplay - what the hell were they thinking?  Just how big was the committee that cooked this one up - 10, 20 people?
If your budget can't handle the aliens, don't even bother.  I think they blew the budget on costumes - the ""futuristic"" car George drives in the end is just a VW Beatle with some plastic over it.
I think I figured it out.  The original screenplay had aliens, but half-way through the film they ran out of money, so they rewrote the ending, filmed a jellyfish for 20 minutes, and called it a movie.  I defy anyone to come up with a better explanation.",1031788800,8,1399,4.2218045112781954

7969939,3,B00006JDQN,"Dare I say it? This movie is unfairly maligned by Le Guin purists like myself.

Yes, the dialogue and script are considerably dumbed-down from the source material, and the requisite happy ending is neither deserved nor properly explained, which results in Solaris-remake levels of confusion. This is the skeleton of Le Guin's book, little more than a visual trailer for the novel stitched together with beautiful images and a tense, surprisingly thrilling score.

Fantasia 2001: Lathe of Heaven? I'll take it.

As an adaptation, it mostly fails. But it's better than both Earthsea movies combined--yes, that includes Miyazaki Junior's disaster. As a cerebral science fiction piece, Lathe of Heaven is effective in its own right. Particularly noteworthy for me were the beautiful costumes and set pieces, along with the aforementioned music by Angelo Badalamenti.

I'm of two minds on the acting. It's solid, but the characters' personalities didn't match their literary counterparts, so I found it jarring.

Lukas Haas as George Orr...what can I say? Anemic hottie. But he plays the part like a depressed Yagami Light, and captures none of the nuance of George Orr's character in the book.

Lisa Bonet as Heather Lelache is likewise gorgeous, but lacks the strength and delightful attitude of Le Guin's character. Her soft-spoken portrayal didn't convince me that I'm watching the same character from the book.

James Caan gives a riveting performance as psychiatrist Dr. Haber. Whatever problems I encountered were on a script level. He manages to stay in character even when the dialogue dips into the ludicrous or outright villainous. Well played, Mr. Caan. Well played.

David Strathairn is also solid as Mannie. Why the filmmakers decided to replace Le Guin's aliens with this minor character is beyond me, but in the context of this film, he fits the role of mentor to George Orr.

That's right: this film has NO aliens. It's clear the filmmakers don't understand the material. Without the aliens we don't have a satisfying resolution to George's problem. We don't know why his dreams have the power to change reality or how he learns to control them. I'll just pretend Mannie's an alien.

All in all, more appealing and rewarding to my other senses, because the average filmgoer doesn't need the intellect anyway, right? (I jest, of course.) A visual and auditory delight, though I understand why Le Guin hates it. Onward to the 1980 production, which I've heard is superior to this adaptation.",1468368000,4,2501,5.107843137254902
