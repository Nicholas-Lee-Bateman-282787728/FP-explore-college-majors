1858371,4,B00008QSBA,"Taking place in our modern world. A group of four young men live and work together as florists during the day. The local women love their good looks and charm. The men also have a HQ underneath the flower shop, where they gather to receive orders for their secret missions. Orders given by a mysterious figure known only as Persia and Manx. The Weiss Kruez team are very skilled assassins that go after criminals and murderes that the police can't put away.  At the end of every episode, the criminals always get killed by the WK team. This is one of my favorite anime titles. It has the right balance of storytelling and action sequences. The characters are all very likable, and get fully developed, the team works well together and avoids the stereotypical bickering that many team/buddy stories have. The artwork and animation looks very out-dated but this show is more about the story. The sound fx were good as was the music- tense and action packed. This anime feels a lot like a police drama; but adds to it with an air of creepiness because of the sadistic criminals commiting crimes. Crimes you hear about on the 11 o'clock news.  The biggest factor in making this anime great is the sense of satisfaction it gives you when the bad guys feel terrified and get assassinated in a brutal fashion. Justice and retribution is the underlying theme that makes this anime worth watching. Throw in some intrigue and you've got Weiss Kreuz. Many of the episodes are self contianed, others continue. Contains blood, gore and light nudity. Good for adults only. Ends on Episode 24, but there are two OVAS.",1091923200,4,1603,4.701067615658363
1858372,4,B00008QSBA,"The idea of Weiss Kreuz is rather better than its execution. The series doesn't make the most of its material, either in plot or in character development, and between that and the distinctly lackluster animation it gives the impression of not quite living up to its potential.
That said, it's still worth watching, and I give it four stars for a good try and a great idea. Although they could have been explored more fully, the characters are intriguing, in part because although they are assassins who hunt and kill evildoers, they do not consider themselves particularly righteous men - they call themselves a necessary evil and expect to be held accountable for the lives they've taken. Each of the four main characters has his own reason for being in Weiss; each one suffers over the course of the series, and each one at least considers the possibility of quitting and has to choose whether or not to stay.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it... doesn't quite. Yoji's first spotlight episode leaves one with the impression that he's not nearly as competent as the Weiss boys are supposed to be - but in a much later episode, he dishes up one of the most gutwrenching moments of the series in his final encounter with villainess Neu. And any episode featuring Aya is bound to be fascinating.
Where the series fails to plumb the full depths of its main characters, it makes up for the lack by doing surprisingly well by its supporting characters. In particular, Weiss handlers Manx and Birman and the mysterious Persia acquit themselves better then you might expect from this kind of series.
With a few exceptions, Weiss always get their man - or woman - but the series largely refrains from being repetetive. Plot points crop up for a few episodes, subside, and then pop up again to be developed a little further. The series is also, as will be made clear by the opening of the first episode, not afraid to kill people. Sometimes the heroes arrive in time to save the day, but just as often they can only enact bloody vengeance after the damage has been done. Even supporting characters who've appeared in several previous episodes are not sacred.
The first season, aside from the episodes dealing directly with Schreient and their leader Masafumi Takatori, is mostly superior to the second; the Takatori clan makes for a more effective source of antagonists and evil plots than the second season's villain organization, which has a more supernatural bent.
The DVDs include outtakes from the English dubbing sessions. The dub itself is typically bad and should be skipped if possible, but the outtakes are hysterical and nearly worth the price of the collection on their own.
Then there's Gluhen. Weiss Kreuz: Gluhen is either the third season or the second series of Weiss Kreuz, depending on how you want to look at it. It isn't currently available in the US, but it looks as though it will be released starting in July as Knight Hunters: Eternity File. The animation is greatly improved from the original; however, because of legal issues, the designs of the four main characters were changed. Aya and Ken fared all right, but Yoji looks as though he had a fight with a weedwhacker and lost, and wears an awful hat to boot. Gluhen also introduces two new members of Weiss, who take up a lot of the focus of the series, to the point that Ken and Yoji don't even appear for about seven episodes.
The story is also improved - sort of. In the first two seasons, the main villains have various operations which Weiss foil, so there's something of a sense of progress and there are distinct character arcs. In Gluhen, there are simply events which occur and which Weiss must face, and which frequently pass without much resolution. It's a better depiction of the covert-ops sort of organization Weiss is supposed to be - in the earlier seasons, the team was usually just given a target and sent out to kill them, with the intelligence work already done - but can give viewers the impression that they're missing a big chunk of the story, particularly when the other two members of Weiss finally show up and are just finishing a related mission. The first two seasons sometimes seem a bit rushed - Gluhen is the opposite.
All told, Weiss Kreuz is worth watching. Don't go into it with high expectations; it's not perfect. But if you can accept it for what it is, it's solid entertainment.",1086912000,14,4385,4.718383311603651
1858373,4,B00008QSBA,"Besides the non-direct translation of Wei Kreuz (white cross) I totally recommend the DVDs. The storyline is angsty in some aspects and having mainly bishounen's as the main characters are a plus. 4 guys: Aya (Ran), Ken, Omi (Mamoru Takatori), and Yohji  who work in a flower shop in the day and are assassins at night, each with a sad past and reason for being Wei. Toss in their wicked rivals: Schwarz (male group of assasins with powers: Brad, Schuldig, Farfarello, and Nagi) and Shrient (group of female baddies:Hell, Schoen, Neu, and Tot) makes this anime a must watch.
Having watched the series before it's release on DVD in the US. And watching the U.S. DVDs myself, the translations and conversion is great. Now if only they brought over the OVAs and Glhen. The manga is also a must get, with details on how Aya joined the Wei group.",1084752000,3,841,4.644295302013423
1858374,5,B00008QSBA,"I don't know where all those reviewers have been coming up with the notion that Cheesiness, Angst, & Extreme High Melodrama are *surprising*-- or *unwanted*-- in a shojo anime. Come on! Really. This is for us. We want our angst and family tragedies and long-lost siblings and haunted pasts and Good Vs. Evil and unrequited love and knee-weakeningly beautiful boys... we want it all, and we want it bloody.
That said, the Weiss Kreuz collection is one of the best things that you could possibly take home & watch on the sofa with your box of chocolates & your pink tissues. Four pretty young things, each one with a worse revenge-complex than the next, all with clashing personalities; an expansion on the buddy-cop concept, only better... four pretty young vicious bloodthirsty international assassin boys who run a flower-shop. And of course they're all straight. If you don't love an idea like that right away, then you shouldn't be renting this in the first place. But if you have to keep hitting Rewind because you drown out the dialogue with your own squeals, then you're one of us, and you should buy this DVD set.
The DVD edition is fabulous, easy to navigate, crammed with features, sketches, interviews, you name it. I was especially (pleasantly) surprised by the outtakes. Recording all that drama had to be taxing-- so it must've been a great release to make that mutant-monster croon ""Till There Was You"" at Aya while smashing him repeatedly against a piano.
I personally like the animation well enough; it's not groundbreaking, but it does not look like 1987, either. The dubs and subs are equally good here, in my opinion. They put a nice amount of effort into the setup. I think the English translation was pretty great, very natural-sounding; people's opinions on these tend to run hot & cold, but I can say that at least the English doesn't sound stilted, and the subtitles at least follow pretty much what the dub says. Bold yellow subtitles were easy to read, for when you're in the mood to follow in Japanese for awhile.
The voice actors were often lackluster, I agree with everyone on that point. I privately think Aya could be even b*tchier, Omi even squeakier, and Farfarello even crazier... in both languages. Schuldig's erotically snide baritone is definitely the brightest point of the English dub, however. You may find yourself listening to him purr ""ruined lives taste like honey"" repeatedly until your Rewind button sticks.
You can watch many of these stories independently of each other without worrying about the overarching plot, which is nice for those who don't want the full collection. The boys get a mission, they go out and find the bad guys, and much fighting & bickering ensues. Most episodes have at least some brokenhearted weeping, and they all have bloodshed (although the pedestrian fight-sequence style in this anime doesn't do much for me). If you're lucky, you'll get to see the gang of psychic/psychotic villain boys, who are even more interesting than the heroes. You can start watching to just absorb the cheesy missions, but soon be hooked on the tangled interpersonal relationships and vendettas. Which is, after all, the point in a bishonen anime. So addictive!",1082937600,56,3216,4.913602941176471
1858375,5,B00008QSBA,"Alright, I don't usually review, but...Weiss is one of the best series out there. The plot and characters are good. Sure, the animation makes Aya-kun a little cross-eyed sometimes, and no one ever bleeds until the OVA, but it's still great. ^__^.
If you watch it (And I highly recommend it. I waited 4 years for it to come over to the US so I could buy it and am now converting all my friends to loving it.), you might also want to grab the OVA and Gluhen, the second series. Both are on animeart.com. Just check out the ""shop"" choice. Sure, the subs are a little off, but that's part of the fun!",1066089600,2,596,4.2368421052631575
1858376,5,B00008QSBA,"Ok, first of all, in response to Casi, I have to say--don't pick at the subtitles until you think you can do better! Have you ever actually seen the people translate? Well, I have to tell you, they go mostly by the people's actions! I've seen it done! So don't pick at the subtitles! The animation was pretty good, except for the fact that there should have been more blood in places--but a lot of anime are like that. The storyline was sweet and the characters were awesome. The ending could've been a little more interesting, but how Weiss got out of the factory? That's for the watchers to imagine on their own. All in all, I loved all 8 hours (plus the outtakes) of this DVD and greatly anticipate the OVA.",1056326400,,710,4.386363636363637
1858377,5,B00008QSBA,"Although the dubbing leaves something to be desired, the storyline of Weiss is extremely intriguing. There are a lot of loose ends that could be tied up, but the characters more than make up for it. The subbing is very well done, with only a few errors every now and then. The animation style, though it does not look as modern as some space or sci-fi anime, is very well done, especially for the characters themselves. If you like hot anime boys, this is the show for you. Also the interviews with the seiyuus, some of Japan's finest, are very amusing. Overall, an excellent anime with a great open ending for the Gluhen series as well as your own speculation.",1053907200,3,661,4.516666666666667
1858378,4,B00008QSBA,"The dubbing is horrible, and the subbing is so-so.. the animation is not that great either. But that wasn't the point of this 24 episode anime. Mostly it was for the voice actors. I already have all of the DVDs and I'm waiting for someone to bring the OVA movie to the USA along with the manga. Recommended for those who like sappy, angsty, bishie drama.",1052092800,2,354,4.378787878787879

7986381,4,B00008QSBA,"I watched all the Knight Hunters DVDs and yes while some were atrocious I was mesmerized.  Like watching a train wreck but funnier.  You have to take these guys for what they are cute and with a bad script.  However Weiss Kreuz is a classic and for all its cheesiness I love it. Im still totally in love with little boy Omi and that squeak as he pretends not to understand sexual inuendo.

A great bonus is the reel of voice actors mistakes and deliberates flubs.  They are hysterical!  I was ROTFL",1245283200,,498,4.358695652173913

7986383,5,B00008QSBA,"Weiss Kruez, amusingly enough the title in english being Knight Hunters, is most likely one of the greatest animes from 1990s, coming from the era of hand-painted cels and made with not all the the great technology we enjoy today, I give the animation for Weiss Kruez a massive 9 or 10 out of 10 for the sheer beauty of its animation not being computer generated graphics.  This is hand painted animation at its best.  I've heard a few comments in the past, not all here on Amazon, about the animation not being the greatest and I felt there was a need to post a review defending that.  Hand-painted animation and computer animation need to be considered in separate categories, not one lump, or you lose all sense of appreciation for either branch of animation.

Also I have heard that the plot for Weiss Kruez is not among the greatest, again, I sharply disagree.  True, this is a shojo series and there are a few moments of sitting there doubting some of the plot devices, but to quote a article I read called ""Synergy Between Sociopaths"" Weiss Kruez was described as a confusing soap opera, and it fits that description very well.  This is a drama series and its meant to be watched with a box of kleenexs and if you are a detail freak like I am, Weiss Kruez delivers on those little pieces of plot and subplot that keep your eyes and ears glued to the TV screen.  There are many details to this series that require the viewer to watch and rewatch to catch all details and how they later crop up, such as Crawford's appearance during the Human Chess episode without the rest of Schwarz, even though his name is not given during the episode, his appearance marks another huge portion of the plot, Schwarz and their role in concerns to Takatori, Eszett and the Weiss boys.  However, paying attention to all these details is what makes the series pure love, the more you watch it, the more you realize what you missed in your first sitting of it and the more you are drawn into the series.  A series that cannot charm you again in the second sitting/viewing all over again, is not truly a anime.  The animation is gorgeous, the plot is very well written, and whether you watch it in english or japanese, you will fall in love with the series again and again with its charm.",1181952000,2,2274,4.471014492753623
7986384,5,B00008QSBA,"I absolutly love this series, this is going on my wish list! A friend of mine got me started by lending me ""dead ringer"" and I became pretty obsessed with it. I must have watched it 100 times before giving it back. My dad doesn't like anime very much, but I even got my uber-religious mom into it. It's that good.",1147392000,4,313,4.147540983606557
7986385,5,B00008QSBA,"What is it about this series?  Once you watch it you are hooked.  People complain that the art is not great yet everyone that watches falls in love with the beautiful bishonen.  Yes, the story seems far-fetched at times (the experiments performed--combining people with animals) and there seem to be some details that are not completely fleshed out...but we get just enough to let our minds fill in the rest.  If you like angst (a young assassin finally finds a girl only to later discover she's his sister!)  The four all have tragic pasts that are connected by one person: Takatori!  Though the focus of much of the anime is on Aya's craving revenge for his family--watch it to see why he wants revenge--there is eventually a little light shed on the others.  If you have the time you really should check this series out.  If nothing else you will get to look at some really yummy guys.",1146873600,3,888,4.575949367088608
