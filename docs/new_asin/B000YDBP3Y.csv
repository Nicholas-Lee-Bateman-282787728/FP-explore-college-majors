8345522,4,B000YDBP3Y,"This new dvd is the second season 10 dvd and the final season 9 dvd so as you can probably tell this is a combination of season 10 and season 9

Thomas and the Treasure(season 10)- It's about when Salty tells Thomas James and Emily a story about Pirate Treasure Thomas Sets off to find it It is okay can be boring at times but great for little kids if they like stories about pirate treasure

Duncan's Bluff (Season 10)- James and Duncan have to deliver coal and they have a contest to find out who can deliver coal the fastest and Duncan decides to hide his coal cars but after he makes James work so hard that he runs out of coal Duncan thought badly about what he had done
pretty good the moral is that its not good to lie and anyone can be really useful in their own way

Skarloey the Brave (Season 9)- After an incident with some coal cars skarloey tries to prove that he is the bravest so he tries to go up the winch but it breaks skarloey feels bad cause now the villigars won't be warm so he decides to deliver the coal himself
So-so the moral of the story is that be responsible is much better than being brave

Big Strong Henry (Season 10)- Gordon says the henry is not strong after being chosen to deliver supplies for farmer mc coll but everyone tries to cheer Henry up by calling him Big Strong henry but they make Henry get carried away and cause some hay trucks to get smashed but when henry is clearing them away Gordon looses the cows so henry decides to help out by getting them to follow the hay to their new shed so henry is very helpful and clever Henry
the moral of the story is don't get carried away about what people call you just be yourself nice episode and nice moral

Thomas Day Off (Season 9)- When Thomas has a day off he meets Dennis the new diesel and Dennis tricks by doing most of his work by lying but when Dennis does get into trouble no one is there to help
Introduces Dennis the lazy Diesel
the moral of the story is that is better if you do your work and not make lies to get someone to do it for you

Seeing the Sights (Season 10)- Thomas has to take some visitors to show them around the island he gets impatient when Gordon tells him he can show them more place than Thomas can. Thomas gets so impatient he leaves all of visitors behind at each place.
The moral of the story is be patient with people don't rush them

If your kid likes Thomas and you want them to learn about being responsible and patiences and enjoy hearing a story about treasure then i guess this would be the dvd for you!",1201132800,10,2535,4.1507128309572305
