8495382,3,B000BLRPOW,"The film is a rare jewel because it is the only documentary film on Aaron Siskind, a legend in abstract photography. It shows him working in south america and on location in Martha's vineyard. The problem with this dvd is that it is only twenty minutes long! I do not think it is worth 45 dollars or anything close to that! I would recommend it for school library acquisitions to have in their permanent collection.",1140652800,5,415,4.546666666666667
