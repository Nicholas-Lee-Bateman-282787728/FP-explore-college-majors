8266292,5,B0017KVV7S,"I learned through this purchase that not all DVD players will play all DVDs. I had to buy a new player, which I could find only on line, to play this DVD because the DVD has some sort of regional code that makes it incompatible with most players sold in the US. I had to buy a player labelled ""region free"" and ""code free"".",1466553600,,323,4.0625

8266294,5,B0017KVV7S,"It was getting tiresome and frustrating waiting for good quality and good Laurel and Hardy films to be released.  Especially the talkies.  At least here in the states. I finally found the best of the best.  I then realized that the best is region 2-4 PAL.. I said it can't be too hard to find a multi-region dvd player... and it wasn't.  I ordered the discs and have enjoyed every one of them.  Way Out West is definitely one of the three best L@H movies around.  And this disc has a color (coloured) version along with a clean restored black/white version. It also contains two shorts, One Good Turn and Thicker Than Water.  Both have color and B/W versions.  Back in the late 80's and early 90's some company's were colorizing black and white movies and I hated to see them that way.  But after watching these and other L@H movies and shorts on this collection I find myself watching them mostly in color.  Our Relations in Vol #5 and A Chump at Oxford in Vol #1 look great in color.  I have noticed in the feature ""Pack Up Your Troubles"" the color version has been edited a minute or two.  Off hand I can't remember exactly where but it's around the time the father ""Eddie"" walks by the cell Stan and Ollie are in. This short scene is completely cut in the color version, but not in the black and white one. Anyway, this is a must have for any Laurel and Hardy fan.  Multi region disc players can be had for as little as $40.  Though I paid $80 for a Toshiba.  This way people can stop waiting for Hallmark releases and start watching some good comedy.",1223769600,6,1555,4.3321799307958475
