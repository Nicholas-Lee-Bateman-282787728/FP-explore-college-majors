8135030,3,B000GY73UA,This purchase was for a Christmas present so I haven't viewed it. I liked the price compared to other DVDs of this type.,1324512000,,120,4.260869565217392
8135031,4,B000GY73UA,"I laughed when I saw it at the store then said - hey what the heck...its $5.  After it plays for about 3 minutes the sound and visuals are almost as soothing as the real thing.  The DVD does ""loop"" so there is a slight pause sometimes, but again, its $5.  Lot cheaper than installing a real fire place.  And it beats most of the crap thats on TV today.",1239926400,,352,3.9857142857142858
