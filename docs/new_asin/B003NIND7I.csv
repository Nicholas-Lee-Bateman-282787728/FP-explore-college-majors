8401221,5,B003NIND7I,"Such a lovely film of thecUK Labour politician, Mo Mowlam. She wasvth3 vital person in the Northern Ireland negotiations for peace. She worked with Tony Blair, Bill Cinton and the Sein Finn.

We meet Mo as she is being presented as the best candidate to lead the negotiations between the UK and Northern Ireland. She was so persuasive and so excellent she was made Secretary Of State. During this time she wa# a very busy woman, but so persuasive. She would use whatever tricks up her sleeve.

And, at the same time, she had symptoms which turned out to be a frontal brain tumor. She underwent radiation therapy, and had a successful recovery. She tried to hide it from the public, but finally it all came out, and she was applauded for her bravery. She had a husband, Tony,  who came with his own ready made family. Quite a life, and she has had world renowned fame for her work for Northern Irelands peace.

8401223,5,B003NIND7I,"Many of the younger generations may not know the name, but Mo Mowlam was an important political figure in 1990s Britain, and was instrumental in getting the Good Friday talks and agreements (with the different Northern Irish political factions) going. Her story is presented by the wonderful Julie Walters, playing her with great gusto and sensitivity. The script is excellent and so are all the actors -- there's not a false note in the casting. The film doesn't just depict the political scene of the time, though; it also deals -- intelligently and sensitively -- with Dr Mowlam's illness, and the way she and all those around her responded to it. The icing on the cake is the music -- one of the best soundtracks for a television film that I've ever heard. There's plenty of humour, but it's not a film whose subjects can be take lightly. Highly recommended.",1357344000,6,862,4.753333333333333
