8457019,5,B0054S6VQU,Best wrestler ever.  Tom Brandi shoots on everyone in this hidden gem.  If you want to hear about all the exclusive Tom Brandi info this is the DVD for you.  This DVD was part of Vampiro's luggage when he was abducted in Mexico along with his prized laptop and wrestling gear.  Highly recommended.,1438992000,,297,4.547169811320755
