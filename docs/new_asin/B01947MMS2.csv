7562626,5,B01947MMS2,"A killer doc on the first man of Rock N' Roll....amazing footage with songs allowed t o play from beginning to end..not just a few seconds like in other music documentaries..  the film and director Joe Lauro give Fats the credit he ALWAYS deserved but has been to shy to claim!
And FINALLY someone has given the equal credit to the legendary DAVE BARTHOLOMEW who, from the beginning was Fats' arranger, band leader ( in the early years), composing partner and trumpet man..still alive and well in New Orleans at age 95",1456704000,8,518,4.630434782608695

7562628,4,B01947MMS2,"The Big Beat includes all the typical elements of a documentary: a history of Fats childhood, the beginning of his career, and highlights of his adult career.  At a mere 53 minutes (broadcast version), what is missing is details about Fats the person such as his thoughts and opinions, and information about his personal life. For example, transpiring during a time of racial segregation we get no inkling of what Fats thought of this, or how it may have affected him. Or, how did his success impact his family. Perhaps that was the intention of the producers, as the documentary is very informative about the development of Fats music and the success of his songs.

A documentary of Fats is certainly deserved and there is no denying his achievements. He played a major part as a musical bridge from rhythm & blues to rock & roll. He provided a transition that made the music more palatable and accessible to mainstream (white) America.  However, his style was eclipsed by more controversial and kinetic performers and once the British Invasion hit his genteel and rolling music eventually  as with most pop genres  fell out of favor. Furthermore, in pop music its often not enough to rely on the music to stay popular, it often takes a certain amount of drama, which he had none. It probably didn't help that he was viewed as a harmless rock & roller.  Even so, for several decades he was able to maintain successful publishing and touring endeavors.

The documentary includes several quality performance clips. It also includes good interviews with members of Fats band and other musicians, including Professor Longhair, Allen Toussaint, Earl Palmer, Herb Hardestry, as well as former record man, Eddie Ray. Fats co-writer and producer Dave Bartholomew receives a lot of face time. His importance in Fats career cannot be understated and he deserves his own documentary.

As it happens to many things, trends change, fads come and go, and whats popular can change on a dime. During his heyday, Fats music was the best of its kind. Now it seems simplistic and quaint. That doesnt mean its not quality, it just means its from a different time and space. The documentary does a good job reminding us why this music was so popular.

7562629,5,B01947MMS2,"Fats Domino's contributions to the birth of rock and roll have been long underrated. A reclusive personality, Domino seldom gave interviews and preferred to let his music speak for itself. Fortunately, we now have this video of Joe Lauro's documentary and Rick Coleman's biography to document the life and career of this seminal artist. We get most of the usual biographical trappings: Fats' early life and influences, television and movie clips, interviews with friends and collaborators, but no face-to-face interview with Domino himself. That gap is mostly filled by audio excerpts from interviews with Coleman done for the book, although the lack of captioning and Domino's thick Creole accent often make him difficult to understand. The musical highlights come from a recently discovered 44-minute film of Domino's performance at the 1962 Festival de Jazz d'Antibes, which include solos from Dave Bartholomew and most of the band. The disc includes the 87-minute director's cut, the edited version broadcast on US PBS, and clips from the French film as extras (complete film is also on YouTube). By the way, this disc was released the same day as the premiere broadcast on Domino's 88th birthday.",1463788800,5,1201,5.260416666666667
