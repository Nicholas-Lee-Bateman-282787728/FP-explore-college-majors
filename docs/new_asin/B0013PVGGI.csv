3118819,5,B0013PVGGI,"VCI Entertainment presents ""BURKE'S LAW-SEASON 1 - VOLUME I"" (20 September 1963) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- 1964 Golden Globe Winner best TV Show & Best Male TV Stars --- Capt. Amos Burke (Gene Barry) was a Los Angeles chief of detectives who was also a millionaire with a chauffeur driven Rolls Royce, a mansion, and a high wheeling lifestyle --- The hallmarks of this series were glamorous, sophisticated settings, unusual twists on formula homicide plot lines, and big name guest stars --- After a couple of seasons, its format was radically revamped. Burke left the police force and became an agent for US Intelligence --- At that point, the show's name changed to ""Amos Burke--Secret Agent"". Burke's adventures were briefly revived in 1994, under the original title.

Burke's Law is a detective series which ran on ABC from 1963 to 1966 and was revived on CBS in the 1990s --- The show starred Gene Barry as Amos Burke, millionaire Los Angeles Chief of Detectives, who was chauffeured around to solve crimes in his Rolls-Royce --- The best of the Cary Grant clones was Gene Barry --- In his career Barry was a male model, had good breeding and seductive whiskey voice --- Barry was also TV's greatest reactors --- With a multitude of comic takes that was perfect for Amos Burke, who had to confront an unending series of eccentric subjects --- Yet he could turn around and romance the ladies or get tough with the tough guys. And he was a good enough actor to hold up his end when the heavy dramatics intervened.

In the original series, other characters were Detective Tim Tilson (Gary Conway), Detective Les Hart (Regis Toomey), and Sergeant Ames (Eileen O'Neill). In several episodes Anne Francis appeared as female detective Honey West, which led to a short-lived spin-off series --- The musical score for Burke's Law was largely the work of Herschel Burke Gilbert, whose middle name was coincidentally the same as the character of the series --- The role of Amos Burke actually predated Barry's series, having been played by Dick Powell on an episode of The Dick Powell Show in 1961 --- The first incarnation of the series was produced by Powell's company, Four Star Television --- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Under the production staff of:
Don Weis - Director (13 episodes, 1963-1965)
Jerry Hopper - Director (11 episodes, 1964-1965)

3118820,5,B0013PVGGI,"How many of LA's Chief of Detectives, have been chauffeured to work in a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow, live in a palatial mansion, and are the toast of society?  Enter one, Amos Burke, played expertly by Gene Barry, whose only real distinction in the cinema was a starring role in George Pal's ""War of the Worlds,"" (1953).

Barry, not unlike the character depicted in ""Burke's Law,"" was well-suited to the role.  Born into a family with musical credentials, (his father was a violinst; his mother a singer) Barry had a sense of effortless style, grace, charm and an attractive baritone voice and, at one time, entertained the idea of an operatic career for the stage.

After appearing in several forgettable films, save ""War of the Worlds,"" Barry embarked on a successful acting career throughout the 50's and 60's.  He even had the distinctive honor to be the first villain in the pilot for ""Columbo"" entitled ""Prescription Murder"" (1968), as what else? An eminent psychiatrist suspected of killing his wife.  In the 70's Barry starred in the short-lived series, ""The Adventurer"" with Barry Morse and the lovely Catherine von Schell (Maya from Space 1999), as a globetrotting, ultra wealthy, bachelor (although a little too old for the role)solving international capers.  The european locales added a bit of flair to this otherwise pedestrian series.

Nonetheless, this first set of Burke's Law comes highly recommended. VCA has done a superb job of remastering the episodes and has even included vintage commercials from LARK and L&M cigarettes, Crest toothpaste, and other interesting spots from VCA's vaults--all accessible from the menu screen. The only downside to this set is that VCA has opted to only release the first 16 epsidoes of Season 1, rather than the whole season. Taking the economically expedient and profitable route, it seems VCA's practice has become all too familiar with these popular vintage series' cherished by classic television fans like me.

The show also stars a pre-""Land of the Giants"" Gary Conway as Burke's indispensable assistant.  The show has a bevy of recognizable guest stars that reads like recitation from Hollywood's Walk of Fame--even silent star Zazu Pitts and Anne Francis in the pilot episode, ""Who Killed Honey West?""

If you like classic crime dramas as I do, here is yet another collection you will add to your DVD library.",1210118400,18,2371,5.053846153846154
3118821,5,B0013PVGGI,"Again another great set. I first saw this show a few years back when TV Land was showing it. The show does feature some last apperances by alot of great stars:
William Bendix- 9-30-64, Rhonda Fleming 12-9-64, Buster Keaton 5-8-64
Jayne Mansfield (last dramatic appearance 3-27-64) In 1965 Anne Francis
pops up as Honey West and eventually gets her own series which the same company is going to release on dvd! Cant wait to get the rest of these!",1210118400,2,445,4.6455696202531644
3118822,5,B0013PVGGI,"A decade before Aaron Spelling gave us a long list of big-name celeb guests on shows like ""The Love Boat"" and ""Fantasy Island"" he was serving them up on this great 1963-65 detective show ""Burke's Law"", which starred Gene Barry as the suave millionaire playboy police captain solving a murder from which a half dozen big named guest stars were among the suspects.

VCI's release of the first half of Season 1 (16 hour long episodes) is first-rate, especially since they've never handled a TV series before for release.  The episodes clearly come from the original 35 mm masters, and while not as sharp as the prints we see on CBS/Paramount DVDs, they look very good.  Original commercials from the film prints have been presented as a supplement, similar to Image's later releases of ""Naked City"" while the end of each episode retains the preview for the following week's show narrated by Barry.

VCI is committed to doing the entire run of the show (including its reimagined ""Amos Burke"" version) as well as the spin-off ""Honey West"" and they are to be commended for bringing back these B/W gems of mid-60s TV to us!",1210032000,32,1116,4.737113402061856
3118823,5,B0013PVGGI,"Gene Barry Starred in Burkes Law playing Amos Burke from 1963 until 1965. Many Famous Guest Stars were in episodes. Some would guest star in more than one episode and each time playing a different guest role. Actress Barbara Eden Guest Starred in 4 episodes of ""Burke's Law"" playing 4 different roles. Frankie Avalon Guest Starred in 3 episodes. Other Guest Stars Lisa Gaye,and Annette Funicello. The show would mix mystery,with comedy and drama. It is mentioned Marj Dusay is the lady announcing its Burkes Law when the opening credits begin each episode. If you watch soap operas then you will know Marj Dusay was in the soap operas Santa Barbara The Guiding Light and Capital. Aaron Spelling produced Burke's law and his wife Carolyn Jones was in a episode playing sisters. Interestingly Marj Dusay who did the announcing It's Burke's Law at the beginning of every episode replaced Carolyn Jones in the role of Myrna Clegg in the soap opera Capital. If you like Perry Mason you will like Burkes Law.",1209340800,5,1002,4.8313953488372094
3118824,4,B0013PVGGI,"I loved this show as a kid and will(may)purchase this set. The question is, WHY the volume one etc"" crap?  This was done to The Big Valley, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea etc: and this splitting up seasons to charge more really frosts me!!  All it accomplishes is to slow sales which eventually leads to(is it Fox?) never releasing the whole series(refer again to examples above). RELEASE THE WHOLE SEASON in one box,dammit!  Then follow through with the remaining sets...you greedy bast...s!
PS And I bet you don't even have to pay royalties...not even to Gene Barry!",1208995200,18,569,4.7272727272727275
3118825,4,B0013PVGGI,"Without Burke's Law, there would be no Mod Squad, Charlie's Angels, Dynasty, etc.

Aaron Spelling had had a career as an actor, writer and director in some very early programs during the early days of television, but Burke's Law helped put Mr. Spelling's career and legacy in motion.",1204588800,4,283,4.895833333333333
3118826,4,B0013PVGGI,"The 64 black and white hour-long episodes of ""Burke's Law"" were originally broadcast from 1963-65 on ABC.  The show then morphed into ""Amos Burke, Secret Agent"" for another 17 episodes during the 1965-66 season.  And one episode ""Who Killed the Jackpot"" served as the introduction of the ""Honey West"" characters played by Anne Francis and John Ericson.

Gene Barry played police captain Amos Burke, who headed up homicide while maintaining a lavish lifestyle; not because he was on the take but because he was already extremely rich and was just working for whatever intrinsic value the job provided.  This was the main hook or novelty of the show, which was a weekly showcase of his lavish lifestyle (chauffeured limo with fully stocked bar, mansion, and a host of gorgeous women clamoring for his affections). Although technically a mystery-adventure series there was a significant comedy element generated by the reactions of his detectives and his superior to Burke's displays of wealth and indulgence.

Barry was perfectly cast as the suave and sophisticated working playboy.  Unfortunately the supporting cast was quite marginal and the writers never developed these secondary characters beyond the most superficial level.  But this did allow room to showcase a multitude of guest stars and like ""The Wild Wild West"" many of these were Hollywood's hottest starlets.  Especially memorable was former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley whose unexpected chemistry with Barry led to multiple appearances during the course of the series.

Unlike ""Columbo"", the series withheld the identity of the killer from viewers until the end although it was not disclosed in the standard ""Murder She Wrote"" moment of revelation.

The huge popularity of ""James Bond"" and ""The Man From UNCLE"" caused producer Aaron Spelling to introduce a secret agent formula into the final season.  Unfortunately what had been a unique cop show became just another silly spy series and it expired after just half a season.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1203897600,64,2037,5.173780487804878

3118840,5,B0013PVGGI,"Briefly, if you have fond memories of ""Burke's Law"" as a child and you have a significant other who did not have the opportunity to previously review the series, I strongly recommend that you watch the series by yourself.

When I was seven (7) years old, I vividly remember watching the noted series.  More importantly, I also remember where and how I was commonly positioned (laying on the carpet), in front of our black and white television set, how our living room was arranged, the lasting aroma from dinner still lingering in the air, and even how my hair was styled (in long braids).

During the noted period, I lived in a small town located in the ""Bay Area"" and everything in my life was pretty routine and predictable.  Conversely, I was @ an age where I was beginning to formulate some ideas about what I liked and disliked about my life (do you get the picture??).

In any event, one evening, ""Burke's Law"" popped on our T.V. set and I suddenly learned about a smooth, sophiscated, rich, and sauve LAPD cop being chauffeured by a limo driver. How exciting!!

Amos Burke's life seemed so glamourous, tantalizing, a litte dangerous, and all I knew is that I wanted more.  While investigating and solving crime, he also did alot of kissing, which made me curious about how to kiss a boy?? (I am still questioning whether I am doing it right??).

Specifically, last night, besides all of the expected smooching, I watched the third (3rd) episode of the first (1st) series, which featured among many stars, ""Mary Astor"" (famous for her role in ""The Maltese Falcon"" w/Humphrey Bogart).

To summarize my viewing, I watched the noted episode with great wonder as well as disappointment.  I watched with wonder because ""Astor"" still possessed her acting chops. You can always count on ""Mary"" to add a certain degree of suspense to any role and she delivered in ""Burke's Law.""  She was marvelously entertaining!! Oh, the drama....

However, I was rather disappointed in how she appeared in the series.  Although, she was advanced in age (not an issue), I could not get over how she was poorly dressed (very drabbed), which was contrary to my memories of her (usually a well dressed woman). How simply unfortunate to see ""Astor"" in that manner.  Clearly, Astor's appearance had everything to do with casting and playing the specific role (i.e. a rundown and rejected woman).

Nevertheless, if you enjoy watching detective shows especially from the 60's, featuring a host of great stars (some you may actually miss seeing) such as Paul Lynde, John Saxon, Elizabeth Montgomery, Lizbeth Scott, Zsa Zsa Gabor, etc., than ""Burke's Law"" is worth some of your T.V. viewing time.",1392422400,6,2671,4.826754385964913
3118841,5,B0013PVGGI,"A collection of 1963 episodes from this filmed celebrity round-up starring debonair Gene Barry as ultra-rich Detective Captain Amos Burke, assisted by an older detective nearing retirement and Gary Conway as a young, super-efficient detective.  Each episode features a nice murder mystery and the suspects are all Hollywood stars.  Some are upward-bound, others over the hill and heading for retirement, with a sprinkling of always-busy character actors like Keenan Wynn and the occasional hot star like Sammy Davis Jr.  Generally, offering twists and turns and more substance than you'd expect, you won't figure out the mystery's ending ahead of time ...although I won't say never.  Mostly it's just great to enjoy briefly seeing these stars of yesteryear one more time.  Producer Aaron Spelling did it again with much less susbstance in The Love Boat.",1391731200,2,853,5.335820895522388

3118849,4,B0013PVGGI,"I've had a lot of fun recently getting bargains on DVD sets of TV series that were favorites of mine as a kid. Burke's Law was one of those (and they recently had it priced at nine dollars less than the 25 dollar price shown as I write this review.

Gene Barry as Amos Burke, the millionaire police captain, homicide investigator, and swinging bachelor was as cool as it got. Each week had an all-star cast of suspects, and a LOT of witty banter between Burke and witnesses, suspects, his fellow detectives, his chauffer, and his always eye-popping dates.

The theme music was one of the many excellent jazz numbers which graced TV shows in the 60s. It is punctuated with a throaty-voiced lady purring at it's climax: ""It's Buuuurkes Law"". As we started up an episode last night, I remarked to my wife that whatever the actress who did that voiceover got paid, it certainly wasn't enough by a LARGE margin! LOL That voice will still send a thrill through a guy 50 years later. :-)

The picture on this DVD presentation is adequate for dated B&W TV material. Be sure to set your equipment to show it at 4:3 rather than widescreen though. These low-res 60s TV shows just don't look very good when you stretch the picture out on a widescreen, high definition set.

Voices are fine, but the music has some distortion, again not uncommon for material with aged sources. I'm a bit sad that the spicy theme music isn't a really clean presentation, but that is a minor complaint. If I only wanted the theme music, I'd have looked elsewhere than buying the entire season (I got both volumes) of TV shows.

The writing in these shows compares very favorably to most of what you get in today's TV series. While some of the plots may be a bit simplistic or forced at times, the dialogue more than makes up for it in clever and amusing bits that keep us smiling through the shows.

Occasionally these older movies and series, when released by smaller 3rd party outfits, are disasters. You can purchase this series confidently, however. It will almost certainly look and sound as good as it did when originally broadcast for viewing on 15 to 19 inch TVs with one relatively cheap mono speaker.

Highly recommended.",1370736000,2,2200,4.596938775510204

3118858,5,B0013PVGGI,"TV was so much better in the earlier days; not just the plot and stories, which were far more imaginative and fun to watch, but also in how the approach to creating a show was done. Burke's Law is a really great example of this.  Today's shows usually feature a prime time star (and I use the term 'star' with great reluctance) and a host of actors (this too is questionable). In contrast, each episode of Burke's Law features a list of many of the major film stars of the period.  Although some of their spots limited to a few minutes, it's incredible to think that a producer could gather all of them together for a one hour TV show, since each of them were as big or bigger than Gene Barry. One of the shows had Lola Albright, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Ruth Roman, Barbara Eden and Don Rickles in a single episode. Amazing....and they were great.  I have not seen the later seasons, but it is my understanding that this piling on of stars style was discontinued after the second season.  If that is true, it is a shame, but I will have to wait and see before I could comment on that.  As far as this season goes, I could not be more pleased.  I highly recommend the purchase of Burke's Law.  I am confident you will enjoy it.",1270857600,,1217,4.242424242424242
3118859,5,B0013PVGGI,"VCI hits all the high notes with this, the first volume (first 16 episodes) of the wonderful police dramedy Burke's Law!

The series is based on an episode of The Dick Powell Theater entitled ""Who Killed Julie Greer?"" (BTW, VCI, wouldn't this have made a GREAT DVD extra?), in which Powell himself played millionaire police Captain Burke and Dean Jones played his eager assistant, Tim Tilson. The intent may have been for Powell to star in any series spun off from this, but Powell's tragic death from cancer in early 1963 killed any hopes of that, so the production company, Four Star Television, screened a number of Dick Powell Theater episodes to find a suitable replacement, settling on the urbane Gene Barry, who played a character not unlike Burke, albeit in a Wild West setting, when he played Bat Masterson a few years prior. Jones didn't land the role of Tilson for the series--that went to rising star Gary Conway--but he did guest-star in an episode or two. For the series, three characters were added: crusty Sergeant Les Hart (Regis Toomey), wisecracking chauffeur Henry (Leon Lontoc) and sexy policewoman Sgt. Ames (Eileen O'Neill).

Viewed in current times, these 16 episodes are a hoot, a virtual snapshot of early '60's L.A., with Burke investigating an array of quirky murder cases: a big-game hunter shot to death with an elephant gun and mounted on a wall, a model found shot to death in a pile of tires (but wait...she wasn't shot, she was DROWNED!), a sorceress dying a gruesome death from thrown acid...those are just some of the entertaining tales found here.

Naturally, the producers, as well-connected as they were, found a virtual 'who's who' of Hollywood folk for Barry to play off of. By one count, a whopping total of 63 stars appear in the first eight episodes alone! Those stars range from Annette Funicello to Jane Darwell, from Sir Cedric Hardwicke to Carl Reiner...a host of big names give these episodes a big bang for the buck! And it's nice to see that some folks have enough of a sense of humor to allow their images to be skewered: one episode features perennial tough-guy Broderick Crawford as a wrestling star who's getting a manicure and pedicure while being questioned by Burke's men! (Crawford obviously enjoyed the lampooning, as he would appear a few more times in similar situations).

Some of the better episodes here include ""Who Killed Alex Debbs?"", centering on the murder of a Hugh Hefner-styled girlie mag publisher (Hefner himself would appear in a second-season episode), with a high-energy Sammy Davis Jr. tapdancing on Burke's desk and telling corny jokes and a catfight between model Suzy Parker and British bombshell Diana Dors; ""Who Killed Beau Sparrow?"", in which Burke is a witness to a murder at a high-society party...but he can't seem to figure out just what killed the victim; ""Who Killed Purity Mather?"", in which a sorceress who told Burke that she was in danger is done in with acid to the face; and ""Who Killed Eleanora Davis?"", about a model/photographer who's body is found in a phony electric chair on a Wild West museum (Barry has a great moment in this episode when he does a doubletake upon reading a tombstone reading 'He called Bat Masterson a liar'!).

Extras include previews for the next week's episodes (with Barry doing narration) and some vintage commercials. There's also an informative booklet with an interview with Gary Conway in which he reminisces about the series). Highly recommended!",1268611200,,3479,4.909863945578231
3118860,5,B0013PVGGI,"Two great shows premiered on ABC in 1963: ""The Fugitive"" and this one.  I loved this show from the first episode.  The pilot was actually done on ""The Dick Powell Show"" with Powell playing Burke.  I remember seeing it and enjoying it.  When the series sold, Gene Barry, coming off of ""Bat Masterson,"" was Burke.  The premise was the same every week.  Millionaire Police Captain Amos Burke would be making-out with some bimbo when he would get the call concerning some person being murdered in a bizarre manner.  It was then off to the crime scene in his chauffeuered-drive Rolls Royce.  During the course of the show he would interview many strange and eccentric suspects before figuring out the real killer.  It was then back to the girl.
The suspects were played by numerous old-Hollywood types on their way down or others on their way up: Zsa Zsa Gabor, Nick Adams, Barbara Eden, Don Rickles, Bill Shatner, Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, etc.  They and dozens of others appeared in the two seasons of ""Burkes Law.""  Carolyn Jones, one year away from ""The Addams Family,"" appeared in 3 roles in one very good episode.  Anne Francis appeared twice, one appearance the pilot for ""Honey West.""  Co-starring with Barry was Gary Conway, who would go on to star in Irwin Allen's ""Land of the Giants.""
The first season this show was on Fridays at 8:30. I loved this timeslot since it was nice to start the weekend with this fun series.  The second season ABC stupidly moved it to Wednesday at 9:30, a timeslot I hated.  The series started getting a little stale at this point since basically every episode ran the same way.
With Bond-mania sweeping the world, for its 3rd season ABC dumped the entire supporting cast and turned Burke into ""Amos Burke, Secret Agent.""  However up against a new color series filmed all over the world called ""I Spy,"" the still black and white Burke (filmed in Hollywood,) tumbled in the ratings and was quickly cancelled.  (I greatly enjoyed ""Amos Burke, Secret Agent,"" much preferring it to ""I Spy."")
If you have not seen this series before or want to relive old memories, you should grab this set and part 2.  (The first season of this series is far preferable to the second.)  The episodes are nicely remastered and the extras include vintage commercials from that period.  Some of them alone are worth the price of the set.",1268352000,2,2357,4.71638141809291

3118867,5,B0013PVGGI,"There were stylistic similarities to Barry's previous series, Bat Masterson, in which he had played the debonair dandy Bat Masterson in the Old West. During the opening credits, as the title flashed onscreen, a woman's voice was heard seductively pronouncing the words ""It's Burke's Law!"" The title also reflected the character Burke's habit of dispensing wisdom to his underlings in a professorial manner, e.g. ""Never ask a question unless you already know the answer. Burke's Law.""

The title of each episode started with the words ""Who Killed..."" with the name or description of the victim (who died in the show's opening minutes) completing it.

In the original series, other characters were Detective Tim Tilson (Gary Conway), Detective Les Hart (Regis Toomey), Sergeant Ames (Eileen O'Neill), and Henry, Burke's Asian chauffeur Leon Lontoc. The character of Tilson was that of a go-getting young man whose ability to find clues and trace references didn't result in his solving the murders, being always outflanked by Burke's cool intuition.

In several episodes Anne Francis appeared as female detective Honey West, which led to a short-lived spin-off series. This was a gem of a show and another hit for Gene Barry, Television's Cary Grant.",1231891200,,1248,5.261306532663316

The program was soon withdrawn and I have been searching for it since. When it came up on a search here on Amazon I decided I had waited long enough and bought it on the spot!

After its arrival, I was very impressed by the quality of the video transfer and clarity of the picture.

This Product is well worth the cost and those of us who still enjoy the Television Classic's will not be disappointed!

3118870,4,B0013PVGGI,"This is one of those cop shows that my mom DIDN'T tell me about, actually, my Dad got me hooked on this one, even at the tender age of nine, I watched this show with interest of ""who killed......"" this one and ""who killed........."" that one and I never got tired of it and my prayers were answered when I stumbled on this while accidently roaming through the DVD section one day on Amazon a few weeks back and instantly purchased it. The episodes still hold up very well and are still as entertaining today as they were back in the 60's and what's even better for me is I do not remember alot of the ones I just saw on this first set so I will be looking forward to the second set toward the end of the year I was told so..............

THE GOOD: The quality of the transfer is good, there were a hiccup here and there in the later episodes of this set that I noticed. Another terrific plus is the inclusion of the vintage commercials from that time period, I was laughing watching Arnold Palmer smoking while playing golf, it boggles the mind (nowadays anyway) how much they pushed smoking back in those days.  There is also a special feature on the restoration process of the episodes.

THE BAD: VCI Entertainment dropped the ball on the Marketing strategy, not so much the fact that they decided to put the seasons out in Volumes but instead of putting 16 episodes on 4 discs in one DVD package, they put 4 Episodes on 1 DVD in 4 DVD packages so it is somewhat a bulky package and I think after they are done releasing Season 1, I am going to write to them ( I already did and thanked them for putting this series out, they told me they appreciated ANY feedback from customers ---HINT HINT ) and suggest they slim down the rest of the seasons because it takes up way too much space on my DVD rack and I'm running out of space as it is.

3118872,4,B0013PVGGI,"""Burke's Law"" may seem more than a bit implausible to today's jaded TV viewers (a swinging millionaire choosing to be a homicide cop is, honestly, a BIT of a stretch!), but for those of us who grew up in front of the TV in the 60s, the show was fabulous...and I am thrilled it is finally on DVD!

The series had (in it's heyday) a kind of Politically Incorrect, 'Rat Pack'-style chic, with star Gene Barry (""Amos Burke"") sipping martinis, seducing nubile and oh-so-willing women (the opening theme song even featured a breathy, seductive female voice moaning, ""It's Burke's Law!""), and arriving at crime scenes in a Rolls Royce (chauffeured by funny Leon Lontoc), often attired in a tuxedo. Once on duty, however, Burke was all business, offering sage advice (the actual ""Burke's Laws"") to young detective Gary Conway and veteran cop Regis Toomey.

What really set each episode (always entitled ""Who Killed...?"") apart were the quirky nature of each homicide, and the guest stars, virtually a ""Who's Who"" of the Golden Age of Hollywood, often in off-beat roles. It became great fun just to see who would appear in each episode! With effortless ease, Burke would sift through the suspects, and always prove the less-likely one was the culprit, much to the chagrin of his partners...then it would be back to the boudoir and more ""ring-a-ding-ding""...

Until the series made the disastrous decision to capitalize on the spy craze (by revamping the format, completely), ""Burke's Law"" was one of the most stylish shows on TV, and certainly deserves to be on DVD. While I dislike splitting the seasons into 'volumes' (which is why I only give this collection 4 stars), it does also offer some terrific vintage commercials, as un-PC as the series, itself.

Great fun!",1217635200,5,1760,4.915824915824916
3118873,4,B0013PVGGI,"In the early 1960s, television was just starting to get over the variety show genre' and began looking for new horizons due to competition from other networks. With the introduction of certain ""Teen"" idol ""Surfside 6"" and ""Route 66"" success, you could say that ""Burke's Law"" appealed to the young people of the Jet set.
It is highly unlikely that a millionaire would continue to work as a Captain in Homicide, given the hours and the constant requirement to answer to superiors. Yet, Gene Barry uses a small staff in conducting personal interviews and significant risk taking, dodging bullets here and there and having his  young rookie constantly get hit over the head every other episode, to solve Hollywood crimes, usually among the more affluent members of Los Angeles society.
So very improbable, yet very successful. Each episode is loaded with Hollywood stars. Either they had the budget or they all owed something to Spelling and Co. or even Gene Barry to ensure the popularity of this series.
When you have stars like Anne Francis, The Gabor Sisters, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Don Rickles, etc. among them playing small roles in a larger plot that should tell you something.
Anyway, I had never seen the old series. I was familiar with a few episodes from the 94 revival and based this purchase on that experience.
It is certainly entertaining. A constant reminder of technological life of the 1960s, most of which have disappeared (typewriters, adding machines, slide rules) and the show has style and a decent theme music introduction.
No doubt it was meant to be ""Hip"".
Burke has an Asian driver and there are several actors who appear such as Sammy Davis Jr. among other minority actors here and there in small roles in what I would call an ""advanced"" show for showing minorities in so early a period.
This is one of the better efforts. Of course, you can't take the situations too seriously and I believe they were not meant to be that way and certain intentional humor and camp are evident.
I look forward to more episodes and clearly this is the progenitor of future 70s and 80s Golden age Detective Fiction shows that dominated the networks for nearly a quarter of a century to follow. Even Gene Barry himself, launched Columbo and as Mr. Howard in ""the Name of the Game"" helped to bring about this era. Worth watching!",1215907200,,2332,4.786600496277916
3118874,4,B0013PVGGI,"It is with some trepidation that one revisits a 1963 television series that has all but faded in memory. However, this one is a real winner. Starring the ever-so-suave Gene Barry, the best of the oh-so-cool leading man school of television, and supported by the pushy-but-fun Gary Conway, this series has aged particularly well. It's one of the first Aaron Spelling super spectaculars, to be followed, of course, by The Love Boat and Dynasty, but Burke's Law sets the general style and substance for the glamorous future Spelling was to have as the glossiest of television producers. Amos Burke (Barry), multi-millionaire Chief of Detectives for Los Angeles who's chauffeured in a Silver Cloud II Rolls Royce, solves crimes with a charm and devil-may-care attitude unimaginable today. The plots are outlandish, the setting outrageous, the casts absolutely out of this world. Where else could you get such guest stars as William Bendix, Zasu Pitts, Elizabeth Montgomery, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Paul Lynde, Mary Astor, Lizabeth Scott, Joan Blondell and Juliet Prowse? This list, believe it or not, is only from the first four of 16 episodes on this four-disc collection!

3118876,2,B0013PVGGI,"Sorry to differ from the other reviewers, but my wife and I just watched a few episodes of Season 1, Part 1, and were quite disappointed. I'm referring to both the quality of the DVD - and ""Burke's Law"" itself. Prior to getting the DVD set from Amazon, my wife fondly recalled the show and as such, I bought it for her as a gift.

It seemed that her memories of the show had been kind, and upon viewing the first few episodes, we were left shaking our heads: what was the appeal? Yes, the guest stars are fun to spot (e.g., a pre ""Bewitched"" Elizabeth Montgomery plays a flaky floozy who even twitches her nose - Samantha Stevens style - well before her bewitching TV sitcom aired).

But the stories are slow-moving, the characters are too wacky and unbelievable, and, well, the regulars are just plain dull. The Zucker Brothers ""Police Squad!"" would have had a field day with ""Burke's Law"".

Also, we noticed that the dialogue doesn't keep pace with the lip movements, at least in the second episode. That suggests poor workmanship in putting the DVD together.

(We did enjoy the only DVD extra - the old commercials, including one with Arnold Palmer pushing L&M cigarettes - even littering by tossing a lit cigarette onto the golf green!)

Finally, we compared ""Burke's Law"" to its contemporary, ""Perry Mason"", and found that there really is no comparison. ""Mason"" was generally full of well-developed characters - both the regulars and guests - and, despite repetition over the years - had interesting stories that allowed Raymond Burr & co. to shine. ""Burke's Law"" is at best, two-dimensional.

""You need interesting characters and stories in order to make a good TV show"" - that's MY law.",1211068800,27,1693,4.722033898305085

Amos Burke (Gene Barry) was a Los Angeles chief of detectives who was also a millionaire with a chauffeur driven Rolls Royce, a mansion, and a high wheeling lifestyle --- The hallmarks of this series were glamorous, sophisticated settings, unusual twists on formula homicide plot lines, and big name guest stars --- After a couple of seasons, its format was radically revamped. Burke left the police force and became an agent for US Intelligence --- At that point, the show's name changed to ""Amos Burke--Secret Agent"". Burke's adventures were briefly revived in 1994, under the original title.

Burke's Law is a detective series which ran on ABC from 1963 to 1966 and was revived on CBS in the 1990s --- The show starred Gene Barry as Amos Burke, millionaire Los Angeles Chief of Detectives, who was chauffeured around to solve crimes in his Rolls-Royce --- The best of the Cary Grant clones was Gene Barry --- In his career Barry was a male model, had good breeding and seductive whiskey voice --- Barry was also TV's greatest reactors --- With a multitude of comic takes that was perfect for Amos Burke, who had to confront an unending series of eccentric subjects --- Yet he could turn around and romance the ladies or get tough with the tough guys. And he was a good enough actor to hold up his end when the heavy dramatics intervened.

In the original series, other characters were Detective Tim Tilson (Gary Conway), Detective Les Hart (Regis Toomey), and Sergeant Ames (Eileen O'Neill). In several episodes Anne Francis appeared as female detective Honey West, which led to a short-lived spin-off series --- The musical score for Burke's Law was largely the work of Herschel Burke Gilbert, whose middle name was coincidentally the same as the character of the series --- The role of Amos Burke actually predated Barry's series, having been played by Dick Powell on an episode of The Dick Powell Show in 1961 --- The first incarnation of the series was produced by Powell's company, Four Star Television --- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Under the production staff of:
Don Weis - Director (13 episodes, 1963-1965)
Jerry Hopper - Director (11 episodes, 1964-1965)

3353317,5,B0013PVGGI,"How many of LA's Chief of Detectives, have been chauffeured to work in a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow, live in a palatial mansion, and are the toast of society?  Enter one, Amos Burke, played expertly by Gene Barry, whose only real distinction in the cinema was a starring role in George Pal's ""War of the Worlds,"" (1953).

Barry, not unlike the character depicted in ""Burke's Law,"" was well-suited to the role.  Born into a family with musical credentials, (his father was a violinst; his mother a singer) Barry had a sense of effortless style, grace, charm and an attractive baritone voice and, at one time, entertained the idea of an operatic career for the stage.

After appearing in several forgettable films, save ""War of the Worlds,"" Barry embarked on a successful acting career throughout the 50's and 60's.  He even had the distinctive honor to be the first villain in the pilot for ""Columbo"" entitled ""Prescription Murder"" (1968), as what else? An eminent psychiatrist suspected of killing his wife.  In the 70's Barry starred in the short-lived series, ""The Adventurer"" with Barry Morse and the lovely Catherine von Schell (Maya from Space 1999), as a globetrotting, ultra wealthy, bachelor (although a little too old for the role)solving international capers.  The european locales added a bit of flair to this otherwise pedestrian series.

Nonetheless, this first set of Burke's Law comes highly recommended. VCA has done a superb job of remastering the episodes and has even included vintage commercials from LARK and L&M cigarettes, Crest toothpaste, and other interesting spots from VCA's vaults--all accessible from the menu screen. The only downside to this set is that VCA has opted to only release the first 16 epsidoes of Season 1, rather than the whole season. Taking the economically expedient and profitable route, it seems VCA's practice has become all too familiar with these popular vintage series' cherished by classic television fans like me.

The show also stars a pre-""Land of the Giants"" Gary Conway as Burke's indispensable assistant.  The show has a bevy of recognizable guest stars that reads like recitation from Hollywood's Walk of Fame--even silent star Zazu Pitts and Anne Francis in the pilot episode, ""Who Killed Honey West?""

VCI's release of the first half of Season 1 (16 hour long episodes) is first-rate, especially since they've never handled a TV series before for release.

Original commercials from the film prints have been presented as a supplement, similar to Image's later releases of ""Naked City"" while the end of each episode retains the preview for the following week's show narrated by Barry.

3353323,4,B0013PVGGI,"The 64 black and white hour-long episodes of ""Burke's Law"" were originally broadcast from 1963-65 on ABC.  The show then morphed into ""Amos Burke, Secret Agent"" for another 17 episodes during the 1965-66 season.  And one episode ""Who Killed the Jackpot"" served as the introduction of the ""Honey West"" characters played by Anne Francis and John Ericson.

Gene Barry played police captain Amos Burke, who headed up homicide while maintaining a lavish lifestyle; not because he was on the take but because he was already extremely rich and was just working for whatever intrinsic value the job provided.  This was the main hook or novelty of the show, which was a weekly showcase of his lavish lifestyle (chauffeured limo with fully stocked bar, mansion, and a host of gorgeous women clamoring for his affections). Although technically a mystery-adventure series there was a significant comedy element generated by the reactions of his detectives and his superior to Burke's displays of wealth and indulgence.

Barry was perfectly cast as the suave and sophisticated working playboy.  Unfortunately the supporting cast was quite marginal and the writers never developed these secondary characters beyond the most superficial level.  But this did allow room to showcase a multitude of guest stars and like ""The Wild Wild West"" many of these were Hollywood's hottest starlets.  Especially memorable was former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley whose unexpected chemistry with Barry led to multiple appearances during the course of the series.

Unlike ""Columbo"", the series withheld the identity of the killer from viewers until the end although it was not disclosed in the standard ""Murder She Wrote"" moment of revelation.

The huge popularity of ""James Bond"" and ""The Man From UNCLE"" caused producer Aaron Spelling to introduce a secret agent formula into the final season.  Unfortunately what had been a unique cop show became just another silly spy series and it expired after just half a season.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1203897600,64,2037,5.173780487804878

3353337,5,B0013PVGGI,"Briefly, if you have fond memories of ""Burke's Law"" as a child and you have a significant other who did not have the opportunity to previously review the series, I strongly recommend that you watch the series by yourself.

When I was seven (7) years old, I vividly remember watching the noted series.  More importantly, I also remember where and how I was commonly positioned (laying on the carpet), in front of our black and white television set, how our living room was arranged, the lasting aroma from dinner still lingering in the air, and even how my hair was styled (in long braids).

During the noted period, I lived in a small town located in the ""Bay Area"" and everything in my life was pretty routine and predictable.  Conversely, I was @ an age where I was beginning to formulate some ideas about what I liked and disliked about my life (do you get the picture??).

In any event, one evening, ""Burke's Law"" popped on our T.V. set and I suddenly learned about a smooth, sophiscated, rich, and sauve LAPD cop being chauffeured by a limo driver. How exciting!!

Amos Burke's life seemed so glamourous, tantalizing, a litte dangerous, and all I knew is that I wanted more.  While investigating and solving crime, he also did alot of kissing, which made me curious about how to kiss a boy?? (I am still questioning whether I am doing it right??).

Specifically, last night, besides all of the expected smooching, I watched the third (3rd) episode of the first (1st) series, which featured among many stars, ""Mary Astor"" (famous for her role in ""The Maltese Falcon"" w/Humphrey Bogart).

To summarize my viewing, I watched the noted episode with great wonder as well as disappointment.  I watched with wonder because ""Astor"" still possessed her acting chops. You can always count on ""Mary"" to add a certain degree of suspense to any role and she delivered in ""Burke's Law.""  She was marvelously entertaining!! Oh, the drama....

However, I was rather disappointed in how she appeared in the series.  Although, she was advanced in age (not an issue), I could not get over how she was poorly dressed (very drabbed), which was contrary to my memories of her (usually a well dressed woman). How simply unfortunate to see ""Astor"" in that manner.  Clearly, Astor's appearance had everything to do with casting and playing the specific role (i.e. a rundown and rejected woman).

Nevertheless, if you enjoy watching detective shows especially from the 60's, featuring a host of great stars (some you may actually miss seeing) such as Paul Lynde, John Saxon, Elizabeth Montgomery, Lizbeth Scott, Zsa Zsa Gabor, etc., than ""Burke's Law"" is worth some of your T.V. viewing time.",1392422400,6,2671,4.826754385964913

Each episode features a nice murder mystery and the suspects are all Hollywood stars.  Some are upward-bound, others over the hill and heading for retirement, with a sprinkling of always-busy character actors like Keenan Wynn and the occasional hot star like Sammy Davis Jr.  Generally, offering twists and turns and more substance than you'd expect, you won't figure out the mystery's ending ahead of time ...although I won't say never.  Mostly it's just great to enjoy briefly seeing these stars of yesteryear one more time.

3353346,4,B0013PVGGI,"I've had a lot of fun recently getting bargains on DVD sets of TV series that were favorites of mine as a kid. Burke's Law was one of those (and they recently had it priced at nine dollars less than the 25 dollar price shown as I write this review.

Gene Barry as Amos Burke, the millionaire police captain, homicide investigator, and swinging bachelor was as cool as it got. Each week had an all-star cast of suspects, and a LOT of witty banter between Burke and witnesses, suspects, his fellow detectives, his chauffer, and his always eye-popping dates.

The theme music was one of the many excellent jazz numbers which graced TV shows in the 60s. It is punctuated with a throaty-voiced lady purring at it's climax: ""It's Buuuurkes Law"". As we started up an episode last night, I remarked to my wife that whatever the actress who did that voiceover got paid, it certainly wasn't enough by a LARGE margin! LOL That voice will still send a thrill through a guy 50 years later. :-)

The picture on this DVD presentation is adequate for dated B&W TV material. Be sure to set your equipment to show it at 4:3 rather than widescreen though. These low-res 60s TV shows just don't look very good when you stretch the picture out on a widescreen, high definition set.

Voices are fine, but the music has some distortion, again not uncommon for material with aged sources. I'm a bit sad that the spicy theme music isn't a really clean presentation, but that is a minor complaint. If I only wanted the theme music, I'd have looked elsewhere than buying the entire season (I got both volumes) of TV shows.

The writing in these shows compares very favorably to most of what you get in today's TV series. While some of the plots may be a bit simplistic or forced at times, the dialogue more than makes up for it in clever and amusing bits that keep us smiling through the shows.

Occasionally these older movies and series, when released by smaller 3rd party outfits, are disasters. You can purchase this series confidently, however. It will almost certainly look and sound as good as it did when originally broadcast for viewing on 15 to 19 inch TVs with one relatively cheap mono speaker.

Highly recommended.",1370736000,2,2200,4.596938775510204

3353355,5,B0013PVGGI,"TV was so much better in the earlier days; not just the plot and stories, which were far more imaginative and fun to watch, but also in how the approach to creating a show was done. Burke's Law is a really great example of this.  Today's shows usually feature a prime time star (and I use the term 'star' with great reluctance) and a host of actors (this too is questionable). In contrast, each episode of Burke's Law features a list of many of the major film stars of the period.  Although some of their spots limited to a few minutes, it's incredible to think that a producer could gather all of them together for a one hour TV show, since each of them were as big or bigger than Gene Barry. One of the shows had Lola Albright, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Ruth Roman, Barbara Eden and Don Rickles in a single episode. Amazing....and they were great.  I have not seen the later seasons, but it is my understanding that this piling on of stars style was discontinued after the second season.  If that is true, it is a shame, but I will have to wait and see before I could comment on that.  As far as this season goes, I could not be more pleased.  I highly recommend the purchase of Burke's Law.  I am confident you will enjoy it.",1270857600,,1217,4.242424242424242
3353356,5,B0013PVGGI,"VCI hits all the high notes with this, the first volume (first 16 episodes) of the wonderful police dramedy Burke's Law!

The series is based on an episode of The Dick Powell Theater entitled ""Who Killed Julie Greer?"" (BTW, VCI, wouldn't this have made a GREAT DVD extra?), in which Powell himself played millionaire police Captain Burke and Dean Jones played his eager assistant, Tim Tilson. The intent may have been for Powell to star in any series spun off from this, but Powell's tragic death from cancer in early 1963 killed any hopes of that, so the production company, Four Star Television, screened a number of Dick Powell Theater episodes to find a suitable replacement, settling on the urbane Gene Barry, who played a character not unlike Burke, albeit in a Wild West setting, when he played Bat Masterson a few years prior. Jones didn't land the role of Tilson for the series--that went to rising star Gary Conway--but he did guest-star in an episode or two. For the series, three characters were added: crusty Sergeant Les Hart (Regis Toomey), wisecracking chauffeur Henry (Leon Lontoc) and sexy policewoman Sgt. Ames (Eileen O'Neill).

Viewed in current times, these 16 episodes are a hoot, a virtual snapshot of early '60's L.A., with Burke investigating an array of quirky murder cases: a big-game hunter shot to death with an elephant gun and mounted on a wall, a model found shot to death in a pile of tires (but wait...she wasn't shot, she was DROWNED!), a sorceress dying a gruesome death from thrown acid...those are just some of the entertaining tales found here.

Naturally, the producers, as well-connected as they were, found a virtual 'who's who' of Hollywood folk for Barry to play off of. By one count, a whopping total of 63 stars appear in the first eight episodes alone! Those stars range from Annette Funicello to Jane Darwell, from Sir Cedric Hardwicke to Carl Reiner...a host of big names give these episodes a big bang for the buck! And it's nice to see that some folks have enough of a sense of humor to allow their images to be skewered: one episode features perennial tough-guy Broderick Crawford as a wrestling star who's getting a manicure and pedicure while being questioned by Burke's men! (Crawford obviously enjoyed the lampooning, as he would appear a few more times in similar situations).

Some of the better episodes here include ""Who Killed Alex Debbs?"", centering on the murder of a Hugh Hefner-styled girlie mag publisher (Hefner himself would appear in a second-season episode), with a high-energy Sammy Davis Jr. tapdancing on Burke's desk and telling corny jokes and a catfight between model Suzy Parker and British bombshell Diana Dors; ""Who Killed Beau Sparrow?"", in which Burke is a witness to a murder at a high-society party...but he can't seem to figure out just what killed the victim; ""Who Killed Purity Mather?"", in which a sorceress who told Burke that she was in danger is done in with acid to the face; and ""Who Killed Eleanora Davis?"", about a model/photographer who's body is found in a phony electric chair on a Wild West museum (Barry has a great moment in this episode when he does a doubletake upon reading a tombstone reading 'He called Bat Masterson a liar'!).

Extras include previews for the next week's episodes (with Barry doing narration) and some vintage commercials. There's also an informative booklet with an interview with Gary Conway in which he reminisces about the series). Highly recommended!",1268611200,,3479,4.909863945578231
3353357,5,B0013PVGGI,"Two great shows premiered on ABC in 1963: ""The Fugitive"" and this one.  I loved this show from the first episode.  The pilot was actually done on ""The Dick Powell Show"" with Powell playing Burke.  I remember seeing it and enjoying it.  When the series sold, Gene Barry, coming off of ""Bat Masterson,"" was Burke.  The premise was the same every week.  Millionaire Police Captain Amos Burke would be making-out with some bimbo when he would get the call concerning some person being murdered in a bizarre manner.  It was then off to the crime scene in his chauffeuered-drive Rolls Royce.  During the course of the show he would interview many strange and eccentric suspects before figuring out the real killer.  It was then back to the girl.
The suspects were played by numerous old-Hollywood types on their way down or others on their way up: Zsa Zsa Gabor, Nick Adams, Barbara Eden, Don Rickles, Bill Shatner, Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, etc.  They and dozens of others appeared in the two seasons of ""Burkes Law.""  Carolyn Jones, one year away from ""The Addams Family,"" appeared in 3 roles in one very good episode.  Anne Francis appeared twice, one appearance the pilot for ""Honey West.""  Co-starring with Barry was Gary Conway, who would go on to star in Irwin Allen's ""Land of the Giants.""
The first season this show was on Fridays at 8:30. I loved this timeslot since it was nice to start the weekend with this fun series.  The second season ABC stupidly moved it to Wednesday at 9:30, a timeslot I hated.  The series started getting a little stale at this point since basically every episode ran the same way.
With Bond-mania sweeping the world, for its 3rd season ABC dumped the entire supporting cast and turned Burke into ""Amos Burke, Secret Agent.""  However up against a new color series filmed all over the world called ""I Spy,"" the still black and white Burke (filmed in Hollywood,) tumbled in the ratings and was quickly cancelled.  (I greatly enjoyed ""Amos Burke, Secret Agent,"" much preferring it to ""I Spy."")
If you have not seen this series before or want to relive old memories, you should grab this set and part 2.  (The first season of this series is far preferable to the second.)  The episodes are nicely remastered and the extras include vintage commercials from that period.  Some of them alone are worth the price of the set.",1268352000,2,2357,4.71638141809291

3353364,5,B0013PVGGI,"There were stylistic similarities to Barry's previous series, Bat Masterson, in which he had played the debonair dandy Bat Masterson in the Old West. During the opening credits, as the title flashed onscreen, a woman's voice was heard seductively pronouncing the words ""It's Burke's Law!"" The title also reflected the character Burke's habit of dispensing wisdom to his underlings in a professorial manner, e.g. ""Never ask a question unless you already know the answer. Burke's Law.""

The title of each episode started with the words ""Who Killed..."" with the name or description of the victim (who died in the show's opening minutes) completing it.

In the original series, other characters were Detective Tim Tilson (Gary Conway), Detective Les Hart (Regis Toomey), Sergeant Ames (Eileen O'Neill), and Henry, Burke's Asian chauffeur Leon Lontoc. The character of Tilson was that of a go-getting young man whose ability to find clues and trace references didn't result in his solving the murders, being always outflanked by Burke's cool intuition.

In several episodes Anne Francis appeared as female detective Honey West, which led to a short-lived spin-off series. This was a gem of a show and another hit for Gene Barry, Television's Cary Grant.",1231891200,,1248,5.261306532663316

3353367,4,B0013PVGGI,"This is one of those cop shows that my mom DIDN'T tell me about, actually, my Dad got me hooked on this one, even at the tender age of nine, I watched this show with interest of ""who killed......"" this one and ""who killed........."" that one and I never got tired of it and my prayers were answered when I stumbled on this while accidently roaming through the DVD section one day on Amazon a few weeks back and instantly purchased it. The episodes still hold up very well and are still as entertaining today as they were back in the 60's and what's even better for me is I do not remember alot of the ones I just saw on this first set so I will be looking forward to the second set toward the end of the year I was told so..............

THE GOOD: The quality of the transfer is good, there were a hiccup here and there in the later episodes of this set that I noticed. Another terrific plus is the inclusion of the vintage commercials from that time period, I was laughing watching Arnold Palmer smoking while playing golf, it boggles the mind (nowadays anyway) how much they pushed smoking back in those days.  There is also a special feature on the restoration process of the episodes.

THE BAD: VCI Entertainment dropped the ball on the Marketing strategy, not so much the fact that they decided to put the seasons out in Volumes but instead of putting 16 episodes on 4 discs in one DVD package, they put 4 Episodes on 1 DVD in 4 DVD packages so it is somewhat a bulky package and I think after they are done releasing Season 1, I am going to write to them ( I already did and thanked them for putting this series out, they told me they appreciated ANY feedback from customers ---HINT HINT ) and suggest they slim down the rest of the seasons because it takes up way too much space on my DVD rack and I'm running out of space as it is.

So in the end, do I reccomend this TV series?, Absolutely, it definitely holds up better than I thought it would.",1220140800,7,1953,4.241935483870968

I only wish they would release the show in complete seasons rather than Volume 1 and Volume 2 per season. Releasing in volumes rather than complete seasons seems like just another way to get more money out of the fans.",1219622400,3,317,4.981132075471698
3353369,4,B0013PVGGI,"""Burke's Law"" may seem more than a bit implausible to today's jaded TV viewers (a swinging millionaire choosing to be a homicide cop is, honestly, a BIT of a stretch!), but for those of us who grew up in front of the TV in the 60s, the show was fabulous...and I am thrilled it is finally on DVD!

The series had (in it's heyday) a kind of Politically Incorrect, 'Rat Pack'-style chic, with star Gene Barry (""Amos Burke"") sipping martinis, seducing nubile and oh-so-willing women (the opening theme song even featured a breathy, seductive female voice moaning, ""It's Burke's Law!""), and arriving at crime scenes in a Rolls Royce (chauffeured by funny Leon Lontoc), often attired in a tuxedo. Once on duty, however, Burke was all business, offering sage advice (the actual ""Burke's Laws"") to young detective Gary Conway and veteran cop Regis Toomey.

What really set each episode (always entitled ""Who Killed...?"") apart were the quirky nature of each homicide, and the guest stars, virtually a ""Who's Who"" of the Golden Age of Hollywood, often in off-beat roles. It became great fun just to see who would appear in each episode! With effortless ease, Burke would sift through the suspects, and always prove the less-likely one was the culprit, much to the chagrin of his partners...then it would be back to the boudoir and more ""ring-a-ding-ding""...

Until the series made the disastrous decision to capitalize on the spy craze (by revamping the format, completely), ""Burke's Law"" was one of the most stylish shows on TV, and certainly deserves to be on DVD. While I dislike splitting the seasons into 'volumes' (which is why I only give this collection 4 stars), it does also offer some terrific vintage commercials, as un-PC as the series, itself.

Great fun!",1217635200,5,1760,4.915824915824916
3353370,4,B0013PVGGI,"In the early 1960s, television was just starting to get over the variety show genre' and began looking for new horizons due to competition from other networks. With the introduction of certain ""Teen"" idol ""Surfside 6"" and ""Route 66"" success, you could say that ""Burke's Law"" appealed to the young people of the Jet set.
It is highly unlikely that a millionaire would continue to work as a Captain in Homicide, given the hours and the constant requirement to answer to superiors. Yet, Gene Barry uses a small staff in conducting personal interviews and significant risk taking, dodging bullets here and there and having his  young rookie constantly get hit over the head every other episode, to solve Hollywood crimes, usually among the more affluent members of Los Angeles society.
So very improbable, yet very successful. Each episode is loaded with Hollywood stars. Either they had the budget or they all owed something to Spelling and Co. or even Gene Barry to ensure the popularity of this series.
When you have stars like Anne Francis, The Gabor Sisters, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Don Rickles, etc. among them playing small roles in a larger plot that should tell you something.
Anyway, I had never seen the old series. I was familiar with a few episodes from the 94 revival and based this purchase on that experience.
It is certainly entertaining. A constant reminder of technological life of the 1960s, most of which have disappeared (typewriters, adding machines, slide rules) and the show has style and a decent theme music introduction.
No doubt it was meant to be ""Hip"".
Burke has an Asian driver and there are several actors who appear such as Sammy Davis Jr. among other minority actors here and there in small roles in what I would call an ""advanced"" show for showing minorities in so early a period.
This is one of the better efforts. Of course, you can't take the situations too seriously and I believe they were not meant to be that way and certain intentional humor and camp are evident.
I look forward to more episodes and clearly this is the progenitor of future 70s and 80s Golden age Detective Fiction shows that dominated the networks for nearly a quarter of a century to follow. Even Gene Barry himself, launched Columbo and as Mr. Howard in ""the Name of the Game"" helped to bring about this era. Worth watching!",1215907200,,2332,4.786600496277916
3353371,4,B0013PVGGI,"It is with some trepidation that one revisits a 1963 television series that has all but faded in memory. However, this one is a real winner. Starring the ever-so-suave Gene Barry, the best of the oh-so-cool leading man school of television, and supported by the pushy-but-fun Gary Conway, this series has aged particularly well. It's one of the first Aaron Spelling super spectaculars, to be followed, of course, by The Love Boat and Dynasty, but Burke's Law sets the general style and substance for the glamorous future Spelling was to have as the glossiest of television producers. Amos Burke (Barry), multi-millionaire Chief of Detectives for Los Angeles who's chauffeured in a Silver Cloud II Rolls Royce, solves crimes with a charm and devil-may-care attitude unimaginable today. The plots are outlandish, the setting outrageous, the casts absolutely out of this world. Where else could you get such guest stars as William Bendix, Zasu Pitts, Elizabeth Montgomery, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Paul Lynde, Mary Astor, Lizabeth Scott, Joan Blondell and Juliet Prowse? This list, believe it or not, is only from the first four of 16 episodes on this four-disc collection! It ain't Shakespeare, and, frankly not wildly realistic, but for a return to the glamorous Los Angeles of the mid-'60s, where Pop and Op and Mod and all that silliness reigned supreme, check out this gassy and groovy throwback to a more innocent era.",1214784000,5,1411,5.086206896551724

3353373,2,B0013PVGGI,"Sorry to differ from the other reviewers, but my wife and I just watched a few episodes of Season 1, Part 1, and were quite disappointed. I'm referring to both the quality of the DVD - and ""Burke's Law"" itself. Prior to getting the DVD set from Amazon, my wife fondly recalled the show and as such, I bought it for her as a gift.

It seemed that her memories of the show had been kind, and upon viewing the first few episodes, we were left shaking our heads: what was the appeal? Yes, the guest stars are fun to spot (e.g., a pre ""Bewitched"" Elizabeth Montgomery plays a flaky floozy who even twitches her nose - Samantha Stevens style - well before her bewitching TV sitcom aired).

But the stories are slow-moving, the characters are too wacky and unbelievable, and, well, the regulars are just plain dull. The Zucker Brothers ""Police Squad!"" would have had a field day with ""Burke's Law"".

Also, we noticed that the dialogue doesn't keep pace with the lip movements, at least in the second episode. That suggests poor workmanship in putting the DVD together.

(We did enjoy the only DVD extra - the old commercials, including one with Arnold Palmer pushing L&M cigarettes - even littering by tossing a lit cigarette onto the golf green!)

Finally, we compared ""Burke's Law"" to its contemporary, ""Perry Mason"", and found that there really is no comparison. ""Mason"" was generally full of well-developed characters - both the regulars and guests - and, despite repetition over the years - had interesting stories that allowed Raymond Burr & co. to shine. ""Burke's Law"" is at best, two-dimensional.

""You need interesting characters and stories in order to make a good TV show"" - that's MY law.",1211068800,27,1693,4.722033898305085

I would have preferred the commercials, which are included as extra, at least be an option to have in the original spots during the shows. That would make the watching the shows even more fun.
