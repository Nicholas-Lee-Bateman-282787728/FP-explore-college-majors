7986977,3,B00008UAO2,"This short (59 minutes) collection of four XPW matches is OK, but nothing really special.  It's just matches; no silly ""filler"" skits or interviews to slow down the pace.  The matches featured (with their running times) are as follows:

Chris Chetti vs. Shark Boy (12:07)
3-Way King of the Death Match Title Bout - Supreme vs. Angel vs. Altar Boy Luke (10:07)
World Television Title Match - Danny Doring vs. Kaos (10:54)
World Heavyweight Title Match - Vic Grimes vs. Shane Douglas (17:43)

Also includes a segment where Sandman in the ring with his kids, set to announce his retirement from wrestling, and Pogo the Clown interrupts the proceedings.  (8:20)

Bonus features are a Photo Gallery (2:03), and two extra matches: Juventud Guerrera vs. Jerry Lynn (12:23), and Youthanazia vs. Southern Comfort vs. Danny Doring & Christian York (20:47).

In addition to the violence (for one thing, Sandman brings out his trusty cane), there is a lot of profanity--so it's not recommended for the kiddies!",1457568000,,998,5.012121212121212

Spoilers

1. CHRIS CHETTI VS SHARK BOY-the opening match would pit Chetti against the Indy super fav Shark Boy. This was a great opening match between the two with some good back and forth action. The fans were really into this one and exploded when Sharky was coming out on top. He eventually does and get sthe win in a great opener.

2. [KODM TITLE 3 WAY MATCH]ALTAR BOY LUKE VS ANGEL VS SUPREME-this match starts off a little wrong with some missteps happening and the fans are not that into it. That turns soon though as all three guys put forth a great effort. The action is fast paced with all three getting in their own spots. But it is the ending that most will remember here. In one of the most dangerous things I think I have seen in wrestling the end Altar Boy Luke retains the title after getting the pin thanks to another mans efforts, great ending.

3. [TV TITLE]KAOS VS DANNY DORING-another good match that had a few missteps from time to time. The fans in particular get into this one but then turn on Doring for a soft slam, youll see. Good action with a cool twist in the ref getting blinded yet still making counts. I enjoyed this match like I did the others, Kaos gets the win here in another entertaining bout.

After this match we get to see The Sandmans retirement interrupted by Pogo the Clown. There are some cool little twists here, this reminds me of ECW like crazy.

4. [XPW TITLE 3 WAY MATCH]SHANE DOUGLAS VS CHRIS CANDIDO VS VIC GRIMES-Vic had injured Chris earlier so it starts out as a one on one match. While it is these two Grimes really takes control, someone even gets choked by a chicken. When Candido finally does get involved things go crazy. There are some really good spots between the three. Things get really interesting when the women get involved. Much like ECW the women have to take bumps here. In fact after a big one Shane retains the belt in a very fun match.

BONUS

1. JUVENTUD GUERRERA VS JERRY LYNN-this was a great match as I was expecting, these are two of my favorites to watch. These two go back and forth the entire time with a misstep or two, but still great. I would have thought the fans would have been more into than they were. Of course they warm up more as the match goes on.  In the end Jerry picks up the win in a very fun match.

2.[TAG TITLES]YOUTHANAZIA VS SOUTHERN COMFORT VS DORING YORK-this was an excellent match and I am glad that they decided to put it on here. These three teams did an excellent job even after what happened. There is a moment in which two guys have the top rope break on them when trying to perform a move, it is crazy. Afterwards the teams continue even without being able to use the ropes really. The champs Youthanazia retain the belts in a great match. After the match we have a moment where while watching what happens the commentator channels his inner Joey Styles.",1428710400,,2885,4.365671641791045

7986980,3,B00008UAO2,"Since nobody else will write a review, then I'll write one. This DVD is fair. The regular matches take place in Viking Hall, Philadephia. The first match is between Sharkboy and Chris Chetti. Chris Chetti is a snobby heel in this match, and Sharkboy is extremely popular with the fans. The next match is a three man free for all for the King of the Death-Match title between Supreme and Angel and Alter Boy Luke. The match ends shortly after all three plummet down a workmens scaffold along a wall in Viking Hall. The next match is for the TV Title between Danny Doring and the champion Kaos. It does seem that Danny Doring would have won if G.Q. Money didn't interfere. But maybe nobody can tell. The next feature was Sandman announcing his retirement. Pogo derided Sandman and Sandman whipped him to the mat with his bamboo cane. Sandman's daughter hit Sandman in the testicles from behind and Pogo top turn-buckle big splashed Sandman and they left him writhing in pain. On another XPW DVD, Fallout I think, Pogo and Sandman had a match and Pogo beat Sandman resoundingly. The next match was for the Heavyweight Title. It began between Shane Douglas and Vic Grimes. But Chris Candido ran in and it was a three way free for all, because it was scheduled to be between him and Shane. Shane Douglas gets out of the match with his title intact a cheap hustler, while Vic Grimes looked to be clearly the mightiest fighter. While Vic Grimes was being a complete pig by table slamming Lizzy Borden and Tammy Sytch, Shane Douglas snuck a pin on Chris Candido and ran out with the belt. The next two matches are bonuses. One between Jerry Lynn and Juventude Guererro. It goes back and forth and takes place in Los Angeles. The last match takes place in Pittsburgh. Youthanasia vs. Southern Comfort vs. Danny Doring and Christian York. Youthanasia wins after even being concentrated on, and Southern Comfort attack them afterward.",1123027200,,1923,4.6923076923076925
