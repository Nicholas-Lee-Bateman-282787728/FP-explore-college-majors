2399412,1,B000B41HCK,"But Fox keeps dreaming up new and inventive ways to hurt fans of this classic (1970-1977) series.

First it was the ridiculously expensive Season One set. We were led to believe ONE season set had to have nearly every extra known. And this, coupled with the still-newness of the DVD season set as a medium, ultimately jacked the price up.

Then it was the release date themselves. We've gotten Seasons Two, Three and Four FINALLY. They were even originally released at a comparatively affordable price. The price change is what helps another generation discover the enduring magic which is Mary. Her charm is timeless irrespective of era.

Fox now has the 'genius' idea to make the rest of the series only available through the purchase of a complete series set.  They aren't going to consider the wishes of fans and/or fans-in-the-making who want to continue purchasing the season sets.

Who on earth possibly approved this concept in the marketing department?",1234310400,34,961,4.98125

I'm not about to spend $125 to get the last 3 seasons of this series.  Seasons 1-4 cost me less than $25 each.  Why not release both - the entire box set and the last 3 seasons?

Here's an idea:  Put your previous seasons on your local Craigslist or give them to a friend and buy the complete series.

So- yeah- kinda sucks because the ones who would buy this must already have the other ones- but as I have long said about seasons 5-7, ""I'll take them however I can get them!!!""

2399417,5,B000B41HCK,"I am a big fan of the Mary Tyler Moore Show. In fact, it is my favorite of all television shows.  I loved everything about the show; the cast (clearly the best ever assembled on one sitcom), the storylines, and the theme song. I not only liked the opening credits, but I also loved the closing credits. I thought it was a very unique way to end the show, by showing episode clips of each cast member along with an instrumental reprisal of the theme song. My favorite characters are Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and Lou Grant (Edward Asner). I have always admired Mary's beauty, sophistication, grace, and charm.  She was also very funny. I believe Mary Tyler Moore's association with Dick Van Dyke on her previous series naturally helped her grow into a great comedic actress on her series. Ed Asner is a wonderful actor. I liked Lou's rough and readiness. A real no holds-barred, meat and potatoes kind of guy. The two of them together (Mary's sweetness and Lou's jagged approach) produced some of the most memorable scenes in television history. Lastly, my favorite show was from season 5, The episode was entitled, ""The System."" This was the episode where Lou, Murray, and Ted were betting on (and winning) NFL games by using Ted's betting system.  However, their fortunes would come to an abrupt end on Super Sunday.

Maybe FOX could have handled all releases of MTM better. I was one of the consumers who wrote to FOX originally after they pulled the plug on the MTM after the season 1 release.  But today, I have to praise FOX for now releasing the entire MTM series because for a long time I thought this day would not come. I was one of those MTM fans who bought seasons 1-4 and then waited impatiently for the last three seasons to be released. However, when the announcement was made that FOX was releasing the final three seasons together in a complete series package along with the previously released seasons 1-4, frustration turned into jubilation. Season 1 was released in September 2002. Thus, I am more than willing to spend the extra money to get the complete series in May 2009 and be done with it.  At this time, I would like to take what's available. I don't want to wait around to see if FOX plans to release seasons 5, 6, and 7 individually. I may not outlive that. Sure, FOX's decision to release the complete series now is a money making ploy, but at the same time, I see it as a recognition by them that MTM was indeed one of the greatest TV series ever created and produced.

Congratulations Mary Richards!!! Go ahead, toss your hat in the middle of a busy Minneapolis street. Love is all around no need to waste it. You made it after all and May 5, 2009 is graduation day.  Thanks again FOX...Tom",1233964800,4,2728,4.541751527494909
2399418,5,B000B41HCK,While I agree that FOX has really screwed people around on this show I am just happy to have the complete series on DVD and to not have to wait for any more seasons.  At the rate FOX was releasing them it would have been 20 years before they finished.,1233878400,8,251,4.02

2399423,1,B000B41HCK,"The Mary Tyler Moore Show is (beyond arguably) the finest half hour comedy format show ever produced. The prospect of owning and enjoying the entire series makes me giddy, quite frankly - at an age when very little does.
That the studio releasing this package found it necessary to take financial advantage of us all by abruptly changing the releasing schedule of each season with the expectation of selling us there wares again is very disappointing and somewhat reprehensible.
I hope the powers that be will read our legitimate concerns and act accordingly.  The many fans of The Mary Tyler Moore Show deserve to have the remaining seasons of the show released in a timely manner.  The entire series package is no doubt what we all wanted to begin with, and those who don't already own prior seasons will be thrilled to have the option of owning it all at once.  But what we need now is the remaining seasons to complete our collection.
 And studio people, don't even think about including special material in the full series set that isn't available in the individual season discs. Never a classy move.",1242345600,7,1105,4.769633507853404

I'm not sure what I'll do - I own the separate seasons but some of the discs don't play well anymore; some don't play at all. If the complete series was available right now I would buy it, but I think there ought to be a choice - buy the whole series for a fair price or buy each remaining season separately. Why can't the studio do both?
It would be fairer to have an option.

2399428,5,B000B41HCK,"The five-star rating is solely for the first-rate content and quality of the series itself; I won't be able to rate the actual DVD box set until it is made available.

To be honest, I don't really understand all the frustration over the coming box set of the full series of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. To me, it is very welcome news, indeed, as the only way I would buy any TV series on DVD is by purchasing the big single box of the complete show. At its most basic, any complete series box set should contain all the episodes over a number of discs organized and identified by season, a series guide that lists each episode by season, name/number, along with a brief synopsis of that episode and bonus features like audio commentaries for selected episodes and more. I'm willing to bet that the MTM show will be given a high-quality set worthy of the show itself.

For those of you interested in buying this or any other show on disc, you may wish to make it a basic gound rule to always wait for the box of the complete series to be made available first before you seriously consider buying it. It may take a few years but, trust me, if the show is popular (especially if it was made more recently) it will eventually be made available in its entirety in a single, comprehensive package. This is standard practice.

Of course, for those of you who do not want to wait for the single big box, it's fine for you to prefer to buy the seasons individually as they arrive. But always keep in mind that the complete series package will likely make its way to fans at some point, usually within a year after the final season of a show is released on disc. This is why, currently, I still don't have any discs at all in my collection of shows I love, like Heroes, Bewitched, 24, The Bob Newhart Show, True Blood, Hill Street Blues, The Tudors and, yes, The Mary Tyler Moore Show. They each have single-season packages available but no box of the full series yet (and some of them won't for years). Aside from being comprehensive and, in my mind, easier to organize and find specific episodes, the big boxes also tend to be somewhat less expensive on an episode-by-episode basis, and even on a seasonal basis.

In the age of Blu-ray, I also strongly prefer, and even require, certain TV series (mainly those originally broadcast in high-definition) to be available on high-definition Blu-ray discs. This on top of the requirement that they be in a single package that contains the complete series. If you're concerned about hi-def, you should make sure the show is on Blu-ray. (This doesn't apply to the MTM show because it was never in high-def.)

Finally, I expect all the episodes to be edited and presented the exact way they were originally broadcast, with all the scenes, music, diaglogue, etc., intact. This also means that if an episode was originally made in black & white, it must be in black & white on the disc, not colorized. If this is important to you, you should check the critical and customer reviews here and elsewhere on the web to make sure that's the case before you buy any TV series.

You should also read reviews to see if there are any defects discovered in the set (poor packaging that falls apart; discs that freeze or skip in playback; discs that are routinely scratched, etc.) Some persistent issues may be a dealbreaker for you.

To me, it's a pleasant surprise that the full series is finally being made available in one box, even though the single-season volumes haven't all been realized yet. For those who had been purchasing those single-season volumes, you shouldn't despair, as I'm sure the remaining seasons will become available in the same format you bought the earlier seasons in, probably soon after the full-series box comes out. In fact, I imagine that, due to the existence of the full-series box, the remaining single-season volumes will be published much faster than the ones prior.

In short, this should really be good news for everyone so, unless there are actual problems with the full-series box set, after it's made available to the public, or your comments concern the content of that box or the series itself, please stop underrating this item and box sets similar to it.",1241308800,4,4220,4.609853528628495

2399430,1,B000B41HCK,"I was already on the fence concerning seasons 5-7 and Fox made my decision much easier in selling them only in a complete series set. I am a HUGE fan of Seasons 1-4. The first 4 seasons balance Mary's work and home life beautifully. Once Rhoda left after Season 4 and Phyllis after Season 5, the show focused on her work life almost exclusively. Sure there were attempts to give her new friends in characters played by Penny Marshall and Mary Kay Place but they didn't last. Penny went to ""Laverne and Shirley"" and Mary Kay went to ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"". With some exceptions like ""Chuckles Bites the Dust"" I wasn't as happy with the rest of the series run. I know I'm in the minority opinion here but without Rhoda and Phyllis the show became another workplace comedy ,albeit a good one, and there is only so much Ted Baxter I can take.",1240617600,7,844,4.451612903225806

2399432,5,B000B41HCK,"I had a feeling that this would happen. I had already gone through it once. I purchased all 5 seasons of The Dick Van Dyke Show separately. The day after I bought season 5, I saw a notice that they would be releasing them as a Complete Series Set. I vowed right then and there to make myself wait before buying any more of my favorites on DVD. I admit that I bought MTM seasons 1 & 2, but after an insane DELAY on the release the subsequent seasons, I decided to wait on this complete set. HERE IS WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE..... TimeLife packaged GET SMART as a complete series release FIRST. After a couple of months, they released season 1 and are gradually releasing the following seasons. By doing it this way, it allows the consumer to purchase the complete set (somewhat expensive) or they can go the economic route and buy them one at a time. Nevertheless, I am grateful that the release is in the works. I've been watching some interviews of Mary on the daytime talk shows (promoting her new book) and she speaks very candidly about her health. It's a blessing that we can see her in her prime on the MTM Show. Still, it would have been nice if FOX would have given us a choice.

I was amazed that I actually got a human being to answer, and I asked about the status of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Bob Newhart Show and The Big Valley (If you think MTM fans are frustrated, you should talk to some Big Valley fans who were treated to Fox releasing the first complete season in a boxed set then only HALF of season 2 in another boxed set for the same price as season 1!!!). The polite young gentleman said that there was no one in the office who could answer that question at the moment, however he gave me this e-mail address for Foxdrop, foxdrop@4icc.com, and assured me that they have all the information on upcoming Fox DVD releases and were very quick in responding to customers questions. I sent the e-mail on 4/13/09 and received this response on 4/15/09:

I own the first four seasons of MTM and refuse to pay for a box set with the same material. Please understand that Columbia is trying the SAME GREEDY SCHEME with the NORMAN LEAR TV COLLECTION! They have put together most of Lear's shows from the '70s, rehashing the Season Ones of great shows like All in the Family, Maude, The Jeffersons, One Day at a Time, and Mary Hartman Mary Hartman.

Here's the money-grubbing twist: each show has special features including the two unaired pilots for All in the Family, episodes 129 and 130 of Mary Hartman and lots of interview materials. I have two problems here: Sony released ALL of these first seasons individually a while ago and, to the fan, everything here was already bought and collected except for the special features. And rather than release additional season sets of these series, they are giving us this regurgitation instead. WHY ARE WE EXPECTED TO PAY TWICE FOR REPACKAGED SEASONS OF GREAT SHOWS? Show the studios you have a choice as a consumer and do not buy these scam sets. If they are really that eager for fan money they'll come around to releasing the later seasons, and they'll sell just fine. After all, they think the consumer base is broad enough to offer up multi-disc sets priced over $100. Come on Sony/MGM/Columbia: wise up and keep releasing future seasons of these series.

Seasons one through four are now selling new in the $15 per season range (a far cry from the original $49 MSR) and the failure to issue seasons 5, 6 & 7 as individual sets is an slap in the face to those of us who have already supported the company with our previous purchases.",1238284800,6,576,4.548076923076923

2399492,1,B000B41HCK,"Clearly everyone posting reviews here are MTM fans; some more avid than others. I liked the show when I was a kid, but I wasn't drooling over the initial release of Season 1 nine years ago. I bought the DVDs a couple of years ago mostly for value reasons--saw the price dip from $30 to $20 to even less in a matter of a few months. No way a half-hour sitcom is worth 30+ bucks; I feel bad for folks who shelled out $40 in 2002 for Season 1, just to get strung along for 4 years until other seasons were released.

Then Fox went in the tank after Season 4. I was kind of confident that they'd release the rest of the seasons (by the way there are a bunch of good forum posts on IMDB about MTM, check that out--you'll see the same opinion most have here). I can't see why it was delayed for years, and it's absolutely unfathomable that there isn't a Season 5-7 package to go along with the full series package.

NEVER have I seen anything so botched, poorly marketed, and contrived like this plan. NEVER have I witnessed a company dripping releases out over 7 years, not releasing all seasons during that time, and THEN releasing a final package BEFORE releasing season sets. It's a total slap in the face to disregard the loyal fans who provided whatever marginal market there was for the DVD release by rewarding casual fans who didn't buy any of the season sets. This is going to backfire on Fox in a serious way. They won't get many purchases at all for this. $130 or whatever the current pre-release price is, that's too much for casual folks in a horrible economy. And most loyal enthusiasts who purchased the season 1-4 sets will balk at buying this set. I can't recommend buying it--this will set a HORRIBLE precedent to Anchor Bay, Universal, Paramount, Fox, CBS, Disney et al.

Just wait until Seasons 5-7 are sold separately or in a set (at a reasonable price, of course, no reason why a half hour sitcom should cost more than $20 a season). It will happen. If there is very little demand for this fiasco of a set, Fox will have to break up the sets and eat the overruns of Seasons 1-4; no way am I going to buy two copies. Rent the later season disks from Netflix, or borrow them from a somewhat gullible friend who wasn't savvy enough to wait and had to bite on this ripoff. I guess I'll just have to wait a bit to see Ted Baxter's football betting acumen.

Oh BTW very rarely would I buy a full set package for a show I like. Generally I buy season sets soon after they are released, but only if they are priced reasonably. The only full set packages I've got are Seinfeld and Star Trek TNG. I didn't bite on STTNG because they were ridiculously priced when released as season sets. In the end I bought a $270 set because I really liked the show and I thought $40 a season was reasonable for that sort of hour-long show. Seinfeld was a different story, I bought the Best Buy refrigerator set, that got to be priced at a little less than $20 a season, and it came with the coffee table book. I already had the individual seasons, but I thought the full set was worth it, it may actually increase in value in time. Besides Seinfeld has the best extras of any TV DVD set--nothing else comes close. A consumer has to walk a fine line between indifference to DVD releases and jumping at whatever the studios and distributors are producing. Nobody buys the first release, you don't get the rest of the seasons released. So I contribute by buying the seasons to encourage the following seasons to get made. That's what I THOUGHT I was doing with MTM. Fox is really sticking it to the wrong people here. Just wait them out.",1236470400,11,3627,4.345132743362832

Why not go all the way?  If Fox really wants to maximize profits they can individually release Season 5, then Season 6, AND THEN release the full series, forcing us to buy Seasons 1-6 all over again just to get the last season!

It's funny how the mind can change so fully when one is royally shafted - for the past few years I have desperately waited for the final seasons of this great show to be released.  But the only way I'd buy this farcical package is if it goes to the 75% off bargain bin.

I bet many of the reviewers are folks who taped the show off TV when available.  Or traded tapes with others to get stuff that wasn't shown anymore.  How spoiled are we?  We now complain when stuff isn't available, when that used to be the norm.

Yeah, if you have the first 4 seasons (as I do), getting them again is a shame to get the final seasons.  I'm hoping the complete series packaging takes up less spae than a bunch of single season sets.  If so, to me, it's well worth it.  If not, it's still worth it to get the other seasons, and I'll sell off the duplicates.

Sad, that the review so far has focused on the release legistics, and not the show.  As have many others.  So give the studio 1 star, but the show is classic.  That's why we have the other seasons already.  Be happy to get a chance at the whole run, for what a run it was.  I'll leave documenting the series to others with more knowledge and time, but I grew up on this show, Saturday night with my family, whatching MTM, and Bob Newhart, and sometimes, Carol Burnett.  What memories.  What a show.  Enjoy it.  It's selling for around $1 per show and what a bargain.

Don't downgrade the release; I'm thrilled to be able to see it.  As long as it does get released.  Think about that, those who slag the studio.  Too much negativety could result in nothing, as opposed to the hoped for single season releases.  Are we better off for that?  I think not.

Another one of my favorites was ""Newhart"" I bought the entire series two years ago from [..], thinking that series would never see the light of day on DVD. Well,Season 1 did surface last year, but how long until the entire series is released? I have no qualms buying these bootleg DVDs. Usually the quality is acceptable and the price is far below the commercially released material..and if the show you want is not going to be released or the studio hasstopped releasing seasons of the show, I go that route.

Well, they're coming all right, but those of us who've spent $100 or more on the first 4 seasons will now be asked to re-purchase them in order to get the rest.  This is a disgrace, and I won't be buying them.  You shouldn't either.

Well, just want to say that I agree with everybody else and refuse to buy the whole set of DVD's because I already bought 4 and refuse to buy them again.  Besides I taped them when they were on TV to videos, and though they have commercials and they aren't picture perfect, at least I saved them, because at the time I didn't even know about DVD's.  Naturally I'd buy the DVD 5,6,7 if they were for sale, but since they're pulling this nasty deal on us, I'll not do it.

The same thing happened with Bob Newhart, They only released one of Murphy Brown, Paper Chase, Fame  and a few others.  I don't believe a season should be started unless they plan to release the whole thing.  I'm tired of buying one or two and then nothing else ever comes of it.

Shame on FOX.

It appears that Season 7 is never going to be released.  Too bad.  Not surpising.

Well, 5 & 6 finally came out.  I bought them, but imo, it was better left to the first 4.  To begin with 5&6 should have been renamed the Ted Baxter show, because he was in every scene, and most stories were about him. He really got on my nerves.  Ted makes Lou look like an idiot, and Lou is supposed to be smart and tough.  Yet, a man like Ted would have been fired by a man like Lou in a minute in a real situation. 5&6 was too much Ted, no Rhoda for Mary to play off of, very little of Phillis, who though she got on my nerves, did it with class, and was such a great actress, she pulled it off.  Besides that, she wasn't in every single show, and sometimes when she was in a show, had a small part.  Crazy Ted took over the next 2 shows, 5 & 6 and he really got on my nerves.  So did the Happy Homemaker, whose only claim to script fame in 5&6 was hugging men. I don't know who wrote their scripts, but I could only stand to watched a few of them.  As to Mary's boy friend.  Give me a break.  He was a weirdo, and not the type Mary would have gone for.  She was better partnered with Dan. As I recall, Mary didn't end up with anyone.  Also, her scenes with Lou Grant were much better in the earlier scenes than in 5 & 6.  I never got the last DVD.  I don't even know if it's out.",1234483200,5,2187,3.956422018348624

It sounds the execs at Fox are just as greedy, corrupt,and disdainful of average Americans as the other captains of industry and finance who have bankrupted our country.  Ironically, I liked the Mary Tyler Moore show because the Mary Richards character is a bedrock of integrity and someone who always takes the moral highground.

I'm sure a lot of Mary Tyler Moore fans would (like me) have gladly considered buying the season sets for $35-40 each, especially since Fox has made it clear that part of the holdup on the remaining seasons stemmed from low sales.  A price increase wouldn't have bothered me. It's the idea of having to pay so much for what I already have that makes me sick.

I really hope the company does an interview with TV Shows on DVD to explain their thinking, as they did when they faced a backlash over WKRP. Like so many others who've already vented their frustrations, I'm just lost as to why they would screw their customers this way. At this point, they can kiss potential buyers of Bob Newhart, WKRP, etc. goodbye.

And like others, I have to wonder what the packaging for this ""complete series"" set will look like.

Original (protest) review:

Just wanted to add my disdain to the multitude of voices expressing their disappointment.  We've been waiting, like everyone, for a very long time to finally be able to complete our set.  Some my wife's and my fondest memories involve cozying up to a good Mary Tyler Moore show each night after we got the kids to bed.

Unfortunately, as excited as we were to hear that the remaining seasons would be released, that excitement quickly fizzled once we saw that it would only be available as a part of a complete set.  Why would anyone want to re-purchase what they had already paid for?  Only to have to dispose of the previous purchases.  Ridiculous!  Of course, no one in their right mind is going to buy them from us ""early adopters"".  Why penalize the people who supported the show through their actual monetary investment?  Brilliant marketing plan!  This is one for the text books.

If Fox does not intend to release seasons 5-7 individually, the only fair thing to do is to, at least, offer rebates to those who have purchased previous volumes.  Maybe a tiered rebate offering that would take into account the number of volumes that had been previously purchased.

Truly sad... we had really been looking forward to these coming out.  Oh well, we'll live.  But we definitely won't plan on holding out any hope for the rest of Bob Newhart.  Unfortunate...",1234396800,2,1651,4.800711743772242

I even want ""Rhoda"" (""Phylis"", too!).  BUT if they continue to release in this manner NO MORE!  You can get ""Soap"", ""Good Times"" & ""Sanford & Son"" COMPLETE FULL SERIES (even though some are edited) for Fifty bucks or LESS and they are the COMPLETE SERIES!

2399566,3,B000B41HCK,"I have to agree with all the reviewers here about the HUGE outcry for Fox not selling seasons 5, 6 and 7 as seasons sets and ending up having to purchase the complete series (including season 1-4 that most of us have already bought!!) in order to get the remaining seasons.  And YES, it does boil down to Fox's bottom line....corporate greed or whatever disgust you feel towards Fox Studios (I am in total agreement with all of you on this).

However, despite all that.....are we shooting ourselves in the foot though?  Afterall, we do want these seasons 5-7. This show is a classic and is something we all enjoy (it's also a show that doesn't air to often on current t.v.). We complained for months and years that Fox was taking too long to come out with the remaining seasons.  And now were complaining that their coming out with the complete series (with the missing seasons) and knowing we may or may not see the remaining seasons in season sets?  We don't know yet really....the complete series is a definite....but will Fox eventually or for that fact, release at the same time, seasons 5,6 and 7 in individual season sets??? We really don't know that for sure yet.  The fact that they don't even have a detail description of extras, etc. or package art yet on Amazon is an indication that Fox maybe just testing us out to see what are reactions are?  I don't know....but I hate to jump on the bandwagon just yet.  Don't forget, T.V. on DVD, like most DVD products change release dates, specs often.  I am afraid if we crab about this too much....we won't get them at all.

In speaking of the specs, another plus side of this is, another reviewer mentioned on here earlier, that he/she would be willing to consider buying the complete series if season 1 and season 2 episodes had a ""PLAY ALL"" feature on the DVD's.  The individual seasons sets of these 2 seasons currently do not offer a ""Play All"" feature....that is a very good point!!! I would love to see this feature on the complete series and I wouldn't mind shelling out for a ""Better Product"" in that sense.

Another point I would like to relay to everyone, I wrote to Tvshowsondvd.com to tell them about the backlash towards Fox based on the Amazon reviews issued today alone.  I did get a response back, and I have to tell you they made a very good point.  We are getting a complete set of a series we all really enjoy.  We can not say that about alot of series that are still in limbo (a few that come to mind, All In The Family (still no sign of the last 3 seasons), Knots Landing (which is releasing a 2nd season in April....but it's been 3 years since the 1st season release and who knows if they (Warner Brothers in this case) will release seasons 3-14 in my lifetime) and the 1960's BATMAN....which may never be released to due ""rights issues"").  We should be at least thankful, we have the option to choose to buy or not buy something that we want. We can donate/sell on ebay/give to family or friends as gifts the duplicate seasons we all currently have. And its very possible, later on, if or when the complete series do not sell well....Fox may later break them out into individual seasons sets. We do have options.

I am not disagreeing with any of you about Fox and the corporate practice they are unjustly doing to this DVD release (let alone to this wonder T.V. show classic). I am even surprised that Fox may continue to just release the complete series as we know of yet, knowing the economy is literally in the toliet right now. I just hope we are not speaking to fast before we get the full detail.  And BTW....this is not an Amazon issue....they are just relaying information that is provided by the product provider (in this case, Fox home video department).  I am sure Amazon would like the sales, but Amazon is just relaying the information....they are not the villians on how the DVD is being produced.

I am just trying to make sense of it all madness!!! Whatever you decide, this type of product is more of a ""want"" than a ""need"". And in the state of economy environment we are in right now....it's your choice on how you want to spend your money.",1234396800,2,4138,4.462864721485412

I don't get Fox. As others have pointed out, their strategy of releasing some of the series, stopping and then releasing the complete set teaches us to not buy individual season sets from Fox. Nobody buys individual seasons and your sales are going to be down, Fox. With lousy individual season sales you are then gonna release a whole series?! Seems like a risky business strategy to me. All in the name of greed.
If you never release another one of the individual seasons I'll just have to wait until the whole series set is in the bargain bin many years down the road.

2399624,1,B000B41HCK,"I woke up this morning and went directly to the computer, as I do every day, to read my emails...Then my heart started to pound as I read in the subject line of an Amazon email ""Mary Tyler Moore""...I didn't read the rest, I just went directly to Amazon.com and was ready to order Season 5..

But wait...where is Season 5? All I could find that was new was the complete series now on DVD.  I went back to read the promo email and my heart just sank when I finally read ""the Complete Series""...including the ones I already owned 1 through 4.

I can't afford to buy the whole series when I already bought Seasons 1 - 4.  What am I to do? I have waited so long for the remaining three seasons.

Then I decided to read all the comments here and was a bit relieved to see that I was not the only one thinking the same way.  I cannot understand why a studio such as Fox would do something like this.

I bought every season of Dr. Quinn, Medecine Woman, one season at a time..Then and only then, when all the seasons were out,  did the company put out a dvd set of the whole series of Dr. Quinn.  I thought it was very smart on their part. Something for everyone.

Now I am wondering if it will be the same thing with All in the Family. I have been waiting for the last season to come out and am still waiting. Will they do the same thing and release the whole series in a box set?  I will not buy the whole series just to have the remaining season(s).

I hate greed....and this is the perfect example of a company that takes advantage of its clientele.  I will follow suit and will do like most people here and NOT BUY THIS BOX SET.  I will also wait for seasons 5 to 7 as a package or individually.

I still can't believe this is happening. I really feel cheated. This is so wrong on their part.

I do hope all these reviews will help bring the seasons 5-7 seperately or as a 3 dvd set package.

And because I am from Canada, all dvds here are a lot more expensive than in the States..When you buy a dvd set at 30$, you can always add 12 to 15$ more to buy the same product in Canada.

So, please FOX, release seasons 5-7 as a package or individually. Don't worry, it will sell.",1234396800,7,2172,4.05868544600939

I suppose they're going to do the same thing with the Bob Newhart Show (which I've been waiting for as well).  What is wrong with these executives - they're obviously driven exclusively by greed.

If sales of this utter rip off to those of us who have purchased the first four season are high, Fox will be encouraged to release a Bob Newhart Show complete box set along with the other shows that have several remaining seasons in limbo.

This display of greed is just another nail in their own coffin.  They complain of their losses to internet piracy and yet fail to realize the underlying cause of such is actions just like this one.

2399628,1,B000B41HCK,"OCTOBER UPDATE: Now that I've read other reviews about Seasons 5-7 being produced by Fox separately on the cheap, I'm in the mood to change my mind about a new The Complete Series package of the Mary Tyler Moore Show.  Fox's response to virtual blackmail by us MTM ""fans"" is to make cheesy separates of 5-7 -- inconsistent packaging and not even an episode list enclosed.  That stinks.  But I think the virtual blackmail backfired.  We didn't really get what we wanted.  We wanted Seasons 5-7 to line up in our DVD racks, completing a set of separates with Seasons 1-4.  And not to pay for 1-4 twice.  Seven ""Play All"" options and consistent sleeves would be great.  What I wanted is a package that looks like Mary Tyler Moore put it together herself -- something spiffy and colorful like her patchwork maxi skirt in the first season episode ""Today I Am a Ma'am.""  But I'm not on staff at Fox.  I think the best way I can get the most delightful set of MTM memories is to bring new fans to the series.  I don't think the negative ""reviews"" helped.  I doubt they made Mary Tyler Moore's day, either. I would add stars if the system would let me.

FIRST THOUGHTS: It's too bad that Fox has decided to force a double-buy of seasons One through Four by only offering seasons Five through Seven as part of a new The Complete Series package of the Mary Tyler Moore Show.  Mary Tyler Moore's biggest fans already own seasons One through Four, and paid through the nose to purchase them separately.  Unfortunately, a forced double-buy such as this reflects badly not just on Fox, but on Mary Tyler Moore herself by default.  The only reason I would consider such a duplication is because the ""Play All"" option is not available on the original seasons One and Two. And some of the Special Features won't play.  But these are not my mistakes.  Apparently my mistake was supporting the series in the first place, for all the thanks I get.  As much as I wanted to complete my series set, as big a fan as I've been over the years, I pass on The Complete Series as it is being offered now.  Zero stars if that was an option.",1234396800,6,2110,4.417098445595855

I'm going to hold off and see if I can get them any cheaper and if I can, I will probably cave but any more expensive and Fox can take their ""Complete Series"", along with their greed and do with it what everyone knows they should.",1234396800,4,523,4.381443298969073

If enough of us squawk, it is possible Fox will reverse its decision and sell the other seasons separately.  Perhaps they are testing consumer reaction.  It has been such a long time since Season Four was released, I've found I can actually live without the rest of it.  It'd be nice to have, but this is a marketing scam, and nothing more.  The world is broken, the economy is going to get even worse, and some genius came up with this goofy scheme.  It has to be racism.

2399633,1,B000B41HCK,"How interesting, a pre-order. Is the studio sending out feelers to see what kind of a reaction they will get from the fans. Well, well,  I guess the people at Fox think we are idiots. That we have waited so long for the release of the last three seasons of this terrific series that we would pay any price. THEY ARE WRONG!!! Don't buy it. And, the final insult is the price for the box set, just to get the remainder of this series and they are still selling the first four seasons(box set) at $59.00. How they can justify the price of $125.00 (an additional $66.00 for the last three seasons), shows they are greedy. At least give us a choice. Those of us who have already bought the first four season, either release the last three individually or as a box set of three.  Everyone else, who has not purchase any of the seasons, they can buy the entire new box set.
ADDENDUM: Hey Fox, you're going the wrong way. The price should be going down, not up. Originally, offered at $125.00 increased to $161.00. I definitely will buy it now. Has the studio heard, we are in a recession. I guess I will have to wait for my stimulus check.",1234396800,5,1132,4.309859154929577

I would have loved to buy the full series for this price at the outset, but now I have to double-buy, with little hope of getting anything back on the $100 I already spent on seasons 1-4?

MTM is the best comedy of all time and a staple

one season in the top ten and failed when it went

a small but discriminating audience.

In closing I rate THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW a '5'; I'm rating FOX a '-4', thus making the rating a '1'.",1234310400,,960,4.2228260869565215
8081336,5,B000B41HCK,"Even though I have the whole series on DVD, I bought this cassette when I heard that part of the small scene cut from the season 1 DVD version from ""Christmas and the Hard Luck Kid II"" -- where Mary sings White Christmas at the office while spending Christmas Eve night alone in the newsroom -- was intact on this old VHS release. And lo and behold, it is! On the DVD, that part of the scene is finished after she sings ""May your days be merry and bright...."" but on this VHS, she finishes the last lyric of the song and there's a bit more dialogue before the Nutcracker Suite starts and she talks with the guy at the transmitter. It's actually a very small scene, I'm surprised it was cut on the otherwise flawless first season DVD set. I'd recommend this tape at this stage in the game with advancing technology if you're a hardcore MTM fan like myself.",1489363200,,855,4.316770186335404

8081338,5,B000B41HCK,"Luv the show.  Who doesn't!  I want the boxed set as a collectable.  I have purchased other TV series by installments, but still want the boxed sets.",1339372800,,149,4.444444444444445
8081339,5,B000B41HCK,"After 2 1/2 years, I gave up hope that this was ever coming out.  I found the first 4 seasons cheap at Costco and bought the final 3 seasons from Amazon.  It would have been nice to have a box set, but it was beginning to look as if it would never happen and I didn't want to miss the chance to own the entire series.",1306540800,,317,3.787878787878788
8081340,5,B000B41HCK,It's time for the malcontents to let the rest of the world get their hands on this eagerly awaited complete series box set.  Claim to love the show?? Stop killing it with one and two stars before it's even released!!!!!!!!!!!,1301356800,4,225,4.625
8081341,5,B000B41HCK,"When are you going to release the whole series? I have been  waiting for years! I did not want to buy all the individual
DVDs. I love mary and need to know when you will release. SH",1296864000,5,181,3.891891891891892
8081342,5,B000B41HCK,FYI for anyone who's interested....I checked out the first 6 seasons from the library.  I'm sure they'll eventually have season 7 when it's released.  This is for those who want to watch these great shows but don't necessarily have to own them.,1278547200,3,244,4.785714285714286
8081343,4,B000B41HCK,"The video tape was rated as ""Acceptable"" and that's exactly what I got. And I have no qualms about that.  I needed to see this episode for a project that was coming up, and I'm glad that I purchased it.",1252713600,,202,4.05
8081344,1,B000B41HCK,"I can't imagine what could possibly be holding this up.  Is it FOX?  Is it that they can't get permission  to use Johnny Carson's ""voice"" in the seventh season episode, Mary's Big Party""?  Is it that they can't get music clearance for the song, ""Steam Heat"", featured in ""Murray Can't Lose""?

I didn't think anything could make me lose interest in owning the MTM Show on DVD, but this is it.",1245888000,4,391,4.450704225352113
8081345,5,B000B41HCK,"I know it's a drag for us all to have to buy the first four seasons again, but the price isn't TOO bad and we'd easily pay the same amount for three more seasons -- PLEASE release the complete series as planned!!!!

I'm happy to pay this price, it's worth it!!
