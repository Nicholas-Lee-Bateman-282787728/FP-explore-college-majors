6365758,5,B00JK7QWEM,"Delicate three generational reflection on fatherhood of a six year old son, Japanese with English subtitles, Jury Prize Cannes Film Festival 2013. Directed by Kore Eda Hirokazu whose [ASIN:B00004U1F9 After Life] is equally engaging. Compare Like Father, Like Son with Arlyck's DVD [ASIN:B000KJU1H8 Following Sean] documentary of 4yo Sean in America, his father and grandfather follow up over 30 years.

Spoiler Alert. The delicate visual music of this film speaks for itself and stands alone as father love for a child and the loving admiration of a son in return. The following is a synopsis of the film content. Like other Kore Eda Hirokazu films the described storyline is less powerful than the emotional impact of the viewing experience.

Six year old Keita Nonomiya tries desperately to please his Drill Sergeant salaryman father Ryota (Masaharu Fukuyama). Busy career oriented Ryota largely ignores Keita other than greeting or giving orders. Keita plays piano by his father's choice, as his grandfather chose for his father Ryota before him. Keita constantly photographs his father sleeping, a visual meditation on an overworked dad and hopefulness for affection.

Keita, not aggressively competitive nor confrontative, has a gentle generous heart. Midori Nonomiya (Machiko Ono), Keita's mom is a Helicopter Parent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helicopters-Drill-Sergeants-and-Consultants-Book-CD-Set-Parenting-Styles-the-Messages-They-Send/dp/B003LHNSS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helicopters, Drill Sergeants, and Consultants Book & CD Set: Parenting Styles & the Messages They Send</a>&nbsp;hovering over her only child.

Keita is sent to cram school to prepare for preschool entrance exams at the elite institution his father entered at age 6. Keita replies to interviewer questions sharing that his father Ryota and he go camping and fly kites together, answers dutifully memorized from a cram school coach but untrue.

Keita was born in the rural hospital where his mother and aunts and uncles were born, near his grandmother's home. Midori wanted to be close to her mother during birth since Ryota was too busy at work to be available for support&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/National-Geographic-Stress-Portrait-of-a-Killer/dp/B001D7T460/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">National Geographic: Stress - Portrait of a Killer</a>&nbsp;documentary of illness and death from stress.

The hospital director where Keita was born phones requesting a meeting with the family. Another boy Ryusai born the same day as Keita had a physical exam for entrance to public school, his blood test results do not match the blood of his parents. Ryusai Saiki is not the biological son of appliance store owner Yukari (Riri Furanki) and waitress Yudai Saiki (Yoko Maki). The hospital arranges to DNA test Ryota, Midori and Keita Nonomiya.

Relatives and friends in both Nonomiya and Saiki families mention repeatedly that the boys do not resemble their fathers. Midori's mother (Kirin Kiki) and Ryota's father (Isao Natsuyagi) feel bloodline is more important than loving and raising a child for six years from birth and recommend that the children be switched back to their biological parents.

Ryota's father divorced his mother when he was 6yo and married a younger woman who raised Ryota and his younger brother. Ryota never allowed himself to bond with, nor even acknowledge his stepmother, instead he ran away trying to find his biological mother. Ryota's father retrieved him and forced him to return home. Grandfather Nonomiya is a gambler, his younger wife is his caregiver after three major medical episodes. Ryota refuses to lend his father any more money, yet listens to his father's advice to switch the boys back to their biological families now, and then cut off all further contact with the Saiki family.

Six year old Keita asks why he needs to move to the Saiki home ""does he love me more than you?"" Ryota replies ""yes.""

Midori's loneliness and heartbreak at losing Keita causes her to reach out and bond with the Saiki family, especially Yukari who offers friendship and support. Ryota has an opportunity to advance at work, but the pressure of personal issues leads his boss to recommend Ryota step down to grant him more time to spend with his family.

Months of the boys Keita and Ryusai visiting one another's homes culminates in the transfer of the children to their biological parents. The moving emotional growth of Ryota with the guidance of Yudori Saiki the other father is delicately followed through a visual rhythm of advance, retreat, assess, retry then proceed through a new temporary balance and realization.

The Nonomiya and the Saiki families join to sue the hospital to discover how the baby switch occurred and hopefully to prevent its repeat in the future. Trial testimony by medical staff about how the infants were misidentified at birth is a shocking revelation. Ryota reconsiders his attitude toward his stepmother and tries to apologize for his resistance to her mothering book [ASIN:0786886161 The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce: A 25 Year Landmark Study] Judith Wallerstein follows 100 families of divorce and reports the outcomes 25 years after parental divorce.

The understated harmony of Like Father, Like Son about growing up is visually compelling. Ryota finally acknowledges that family may be chosen as well as biological, as Midori reminds him that marriage is a chosen love, and a marriage is a family [ASIN:B007I1Q59E My Afternoons With Margueritte] Giselle Casadesus 94 years of age, Gerard Depardieu.

Love is an intricate, constantly evolving process, apparently fragile yet resilient like the silk of a spiderweb bonding human beings to one another.

Ryota grows beyond his childhood role model of fathering under the mentorship of Yudai, learns about making time for family and apology, and accepts forgiveness. Then moves forward into the present with a chosen surrogate family.

6365760,5,B00JK7QWEM,"This review is for: Like Father, Like Son [DVD] (DVD)

This wonderful Japanese film deservedly won the 2013 Jury Prize at Cannes. It is the most natural and touching film I've seen this year.
Two boys are placed with the wrong parents just after birth and we join the two families when the boys are six and lawyers are trying to unscramble the mix-up.
Wealthy and ambitious Ryota and Midori have been rearing the biological son of easy-going and biophilous Yudai and Yukari who have themselves raised the hard-driven couple's young boy in a more loving and laissez-faire atmosphere.
Hirokazu Kooreda's direction teases superb acting from the whole cast, including the children. We become so enmeshed with the families that we don't so much 'watch' them as live with them through their dilemma.
This stunning naturalistic film explores so much more than the well-worn nature/nurture debate. It details the personal cost of arch ambition, the meaning of love, duty, attachment and separation.
For me the film turns, not on the axis of the fathers (who tend to dominate screen time) but on the quite extraordinary skill of the two women who must resolve an almost impossible puzzle. In these roles Yoko Maki and Machiko Ono both deserve Oscars.
Peter Bradshaw (film critic) described the film as ""undemanding"". I completely disagree, it is compelling viewing. My vote goes with the Jury.",1399420800,,1384,5.017391304347826

6365762,4,B00JK7QWEM,"Two baby boys are switched at birth.  Two sets of parents are informed of this when the boys are about to start school, after one has medical tests.  The parents of one boy have much more money than the parents of the other.  The son they have raised has had a rigid type of upbringing.  While his mother is warm and nurturing, his father spends more time at work than with his only child. The other parents struggle financially, but the father spends a lot of time playing with their three children.  What should they do?  Apparently, switched babies in Japan were not rare.  Most of the time the children were switched back and told to forget their other life and other parents.  Is that the best way?  Might it be better to stay with the wrong parents?  Might it be better for one set of parents to raise both boys?  These are the questions that come up in this movie.  I wondered what other watchers of this movie thought about the situation, as they watched it unfold.  I discovered I found myself thinking the child who was most like the parents should be with those parents, regardless of blood ties.  What happens at the end of the movie wasn't as clear as I thought it should have been.  Thus, four stars instead of five.

Rating = ***
Director:  Hirokazu Koreeda
Producers:  Tatsuro Hatanaka et al.
Streaming
2013

Film = barely three (3) stars; subtitles/translations = five (5) stars.  Director Hirokazu Koreeda (who is also credited as the sole screen writer and editor) treads much too lightly on a tale filled with dramatic possibilities.  Perhaps the Director feared his story could easy degenerate into an overly melodramatic morass, since he frequently steers his film in the opposite direction resulting in trivia and wooden acting.  The plot involves the revelation (after the criminal statue of limitations has expired) that male babies were deliberately switched immediately after birth.  This apparently is not unusual at the local hospital that lacks basic controls to prevent these crimes.  However, it does employ a lawyer who seems to specialize in such matters.  The photoplay deals with the discovery of, family reactions to, and ""final"" remediation of the issue.  (Maintaining  the status quo [and minimizing the trauma] via quick reciprocal adoptions would seem like a straight-forward approach, but it is never seriously perused.  Perhaps this is because it would abruptly end the story and turn the movie into a short subject!)  Impact of vastly different family socio-economic conditions (one with a rising-salaryman-star father; the other with a small-shopkeeper father) becomes a major plot point often eclipsing the baby-switching factor (a more accurate movie title might be: ""Like Family [Fortunes], Like Son""!).  Koreeda seems to have focused his energy on directing his child actors (understandably, as they are usually a major challenge), and, in the process, neglected the performances of his adult actors.  Further, those playing the parents in the salaryman family are miscast.  The ""score"" mostly consists of fragmented piano playing (the salaryman's ""son"" is learning to play this instrument) which is overly done.  But not completely to the point of boring irritation.  Subtitles are excellent with opening and closing credits completely translated.  All closing credits can be viewed just in English!  An extreme rarity in Japanese films. Doumoarigatou goziamashita!  Worth watching, but don't expect too much.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1456185600,,2343,5.628571428571429

Building Like Father Like Son up in my mind, I (and I know it's my fault) thought that this movie would be even better and more emotionally hard to deal with.  I made the assumption that like Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction would be better (and I was right).  This was not the case with Like Father Like Son.  My wife and I braced ourselves in anticipation for what would ultimately be an emotionally difficult movie; imagine this happening to your family or even the death of your child.

 I don't remember how I came to hear about this movie but I am glad I did. Some movies are just so good that they have to be written about and recommended.
Like Father, Like Son is about life, parenting, class differences and the ultimate question- the debate of nature versus nature.
The movie opens with Ryota Nonomiya and his wife Midori are prosperous young couple and they have planned their life for their son Keita as well. However they get a call from the hospital where Keita was born that reveals that he is not their child. Soon they get to meet the parents of their son: Yudai and Yukari Saiki. The Saikis are a starkly different from them, they are struggling middle class people - the husband sells light bulbs and the wife works in an fast food restaurant. The rest of the movie chronicles the  two families attempt at trying to not only come to terms with the tragedy but also trying to swap the real babies once for all.
As I mentioned this is a movie about parenting, nature versus nurture, the rigid Japanese society and their style of parenting. There are so many subtle messages here and the music is mesmerizing ( Thanks to Bach)
Great direction from Koreeda, another great film a bit more happier than his Nobody Knows in 2004. This movie has great direction, acting with a beautiful score.

6365783,5,B00JK7QWEM,"Some films hit you in unexpected ways.  Sometimes you watch a film, and its the unexpected aspect of it, that moment that takes you by surprise, that you walk away with and carry with you and hold tightly, so tightly that it becomes a part of you.  While watching Like Father, Like Son, I found myself taking it in, deep.

Im partial to heartbreaking family dramas.  Ive said this many times.  I like films that feature families in situations that cause conflict or conundrums of emotions and wind up leaving me a sobbing mess.  I feel like I need that, because it is in those moments where we see the darker aspects of our own lives, beings, thoughts, desires and we can better ourselves.  I know that many people seek out films as a form of escape, but I steadily look for films that feature parts of me, that explain parts of me.

I just want to say that if anything happened to my wife and I like that of which happens to the characters in this film, there would be bodies.

Like Father, Like Son tells the tale of two families caught in the wake of a dire realization; their sons, who they have nurtured and loved for years, were switched at birth.  The weight of this realization is enough to cause any warm blooded human to basically lose it.  I mean, the very idea, right now, that one of my three LOVED children is actually not mine, and that a child that I made but have not been able to actually father is living in another family, with people that I do not knowI think I may need more anxiety medication just thinking about this.  Its not a subject that any parent ever wants to find themselves in, but here we see how this realization affects these four parents in different ways.  We are mostly focusing on Ryota (go figure, the man gets the bulk of the character development) as he tries to think everything out clinically and logically.  Hes a very hard working businessman who has spent minimal time with the boy he has at home, and so for him the decision feels almost simple; give me my blood son.  His wife, Midori, reacts much differently.  She has bonded with their child and so to her, it is not blood but the emotional connection that creates a family.  Still, Ryota continues to dwell on the matters from a purely selfish standpoint, even offering (as if it were a kind gesture), to take both boys, since the other family already have two children of their own.  As the film progresses, Ryotas backstory is unveiled, his family life is broached, his emotional reservations dissected, his coldness melted and his final conversation with the boy he once believed was his son is just heartbreaking.

TORE ME APART.

Hirokazu Koreeda is very delicate with the direction of this film, never pushing any agenda or political or even social viewpoint, but allowing Ryotas story to evolve naturally and compassionately, flaws exposed and yet his humanity is so richly obvious.  The cast is also exceptional, with Masaharu Fukuyama delivering a stunning portrait of a man conflicted between his heart and his head.  Its a beautifully sincere and evolving performance, and the scene with the camera, on the couch, the realization that this boy LOVES youMY GOD!  Machiko Ono is also remarkable as his wife, caught in the wake of his careless self-regard.  Yoko Maki and Riri Furanki have limited screen time, as the other couple, but they make so much of what they are given.

The scene by the lake, the picture, the momentIll never forget that.

Like Father, Like Son is a tender look at what it means to be a family, what it means to be a father.  As Ryota tackles this heavy subject, his viewpoint and intentions change as he dissects his own stance as a father.  A man who was closed off to his childs world, consumed by his own agenda and the outward appearance of a happy and well-off family took over what should have been the most important aspects of his life, but as the film progresses and Ryota learns what it means to be a father, all the pieces fall into place in a natural and heart-soaring climax.",1421020800,9,4026,4.538781163434903

I really don't want to say anything because I saw it without any idea of the premise or story.

At the core of the story is human connection. That no matter how much you may want the best for your loved ones, your friends, your co-workers, or your children, if you have no real emotional connection with them then your life will reflect it. You may have all the discipline and financial success and it would not matter. Consequently if you have a deep love and connection with your loved ones then your status or position in life will be secondary to your full and rich interaction with others.

That no matter if they are blood related or not. You decide who your family is, or more importantly and sadly, who is not your family.

It is quite interesting to compare the two families and how they behave, and cope with the problem, as well as the subtle changes in Fukuyama.

6365800,5,B00JK7QWEM,"This movie is bound to become a classic. The whole movie is about two boys who were switched at birth. That is what the first part of the movie is about. The rest of the movie is about decisions, emotions, child psychology. Forgetting about the issue of switched at birth. I don't think there is a scene in the movie that every parent had to deal with at one point. Of course there is diversity in this movie. There is the one family where the father is an architect who lives in a fancy high rise apartment. Then the other family were the father is an appliance repairman and their business is also their home. So naturally there is potential for a clash from both sides. The mothers in this movie are just that. They are concerned for both of the boys, and the emotional toll this will take on their lives. Of course you hear the feedback from the grandparents, and relatives, who have to throw in their two cents, and also the boss who always offers a ridiculous suggestion. This movie is a great one from beginning to end. Get a box of tissues out and get ready for good cry. I hope someone in Hollywood is watching this movie. This is what we need more of at the theatre, and not movies that are all special effects, blood and gore, and loaded with filthy language. Another great part of this movie is if you have never been to Japan you will see everything in this movie. Country, city, shopping malls, parks, schools, mass transit, and lots of culture.",1412035200,16,1459,4.387453874538745

6365805,5,B00JK7QWEM,"Two reasonably conventional Japanese spouses live their lives unknown to each other. Each pair has a six year old son born on the same day in the same hospital. One day, the unthinkable happens; the hospital calls to inform them that their babies had been switched at birth. Each family had been raising the other's child for six years. Up to that moment of revelation, the normal bonding of parent to child had proceeded. Director Kore Eda Hirokazu introduces the dilemma in two scenes. In the first, Midori (Machiko Ono) the wife of Ryota (Masaharu Fukuyama) tells her husband the hospital in which she gave birth wishes a meeting. In the second, the opening words spoken by her are ""Switched babies?"" A number of very troubling issues present themselves. What should be done? How should it be done? Should love of one's raised child take preference over one's biological child? What if Midori and Ryota cannot agree over any proposed solution? Further complicating an already muddy water is the other set of spouses. The questions just posed by the one pair will surely be raised by the other. What about the boys themselves? All they know of Mommy and Daddy is that the latter have always been there and presumably will always be. The key word that director Hirokazu dissects is ""presumably.""

In the cinematic universe of LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON, nothing is taken for granted. The inner meaning of the title accrues a growing resonance when the viewer gradually learns that the father-son relation of the twin spouses is not limited to the switched boys. Ryota himself is a son to his father, who raised the former as a stern martinet, a drill master who imprinted his own unbending mindset on Ryota. Ryota's son is Keita, a sweet and loving son who wants only to please a father who refuses to be pleased. Ryota insists that Keita play the piano, an ordeal for which Keita has no talent. Ryota demands that Keita cram for a special kindergarten school that might place him on the fast track for success in a socially conscious status society like Japan. Keita tries mightily but is a source of continuous frustration for his father who has little time to interact with his son except to issue orders. Keita compromises with his reduced time with Ryota by taking pictures of him sleeping, thus allowing him some measure of visual contact.

Ryota and Midori meet the parents of their biological son. Yukari (Riri Furanaki) is a low-income appliance store owner and his wife Yudai Saiki (Yoko Maki) is a waitress, both of whom are looked down upon by the upper class Ryota. Yukari is an easy-going man who raises his three children with unending love, patience, and kindness. Ryota is soon convinced that Yukari is an unfit parent and even briefly contemplates raising Yukari's switched son Ryusai and his own Keita together under his own roof as semi-bonded brothers. What becomes evident in a comparison of Ryota and Yukari is that money and status are far less important than family cohesion. Ryota's wife Midori often complains to him that he is overly strict with Keita.

The two couples agree to let the biological son remain with his biological parents for one weekend per month. This only postpones a final decision, a body blow that stuns Midori. Ryota decides to make this temporary decision a permanent one. The viewer is forced to feel the same pain as Keita, who is told to refer to Riri as Father and Yudai as Mother.  LIKE FATHER LIKE SON builds its power through frequent cut away scenes that unveil the helplessness that the switched boys obviously feel and the inner torment that Ryota slowly comes to acknowledge. Midori, in one excruciating scene cries that she is starting to love Ryusai even as she feels that this love is a betrayal of Keita. The child actors are totally believable as they go about their business of being children and almost as if an afterthought they might act probing questions. Keita asks Ryota who loves him more: Ryota or Yukari. Without hesitation, Ryota replies that Yukari does. It is these small scenes of understated crisis and muffled emotion that make LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON a treasure never to be forgotten.",1406937600,18,4162,4.800557880055788
