8516248,4,B007GA1FW4,"No frills video, but gets the fundamentals across quite well. My 12-month-old pays attention for most of the film, whereas she rarely turns her head to the screen to watch anything.",1433808000,,181,4.870967741935484
8516249,5,B007GA1FW4,This was a good video. I'm trying to learn german and this had the English translation with the german speaker. Easy to follow along. I'm starting out slow. Usually the immersion thing doesn't work for me and I need to hear what the words are in English or else I'm lost in translation. But this was ok.,1415232000,,303,4.333333333333333
8516250,5,B007GA1FW4,"I think it is the best DVD for native speakers! it is only for up to maximum I would say about 4 years old, because it is really the way how only native speakers learn. And the age is not fixed so it could be over before 3 even, so if your child does not like it he cannot absorb the language anymore. I only wish there will be be DVDs as soon as possible.

There you can have not only words such as other near-cartoon DVDs would give, but also real situations and sentences. It has German words and very small English for parents or lucky kids who can read also. SO this will provide not only speaking level but also readying and spelling.

I hope there will be more volumes with longer time soon. This one is 25mins but is enough for the start.",1395273600,,746,4.102739726027397
8516251,5,B007GA1FW4,"My two year old enjoys watching this video because he recognizes the common objects and vocabulary.  I was surprised how fast he repeated the words (I guess I expected him to watch TV more passively, without immediate interaction).  The objects and phrases are all named and spelled out in subtitles in German (with small English translation subtitle), so this would also make it suitable for a beginning German class (class room or home schooling kids or groups).  My bilingually raised two year old (German/ English) relates to the vocabulary words pictured and will repeat the German and on subsequent viewings even translate and say the English word as well.  He will retain the words and repeat them in play or when prompted.  He doesn't mind watching it over and over again and it keeps his attention longer than Elmo or other TV shows.  Because it reinforces language development and learning you don't have to feel guilty for sitting little one in front of the TV for 30 min while you get a shower or take care of things that require no interruptions.  Kids who I babysit occasionally typically interact by blurting out the English word as they see it and seem to absorb the German.  I would expect them to have multiple viewings before they would repeat the German word.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to expose their little one to a foreign language, and German in particular.  The same content is also available in Russian, Chinese and Spanish.",1333324800,,1477,4.825396825396825
8516252,5,B007GA1FW4,"This video is a super teaching tool and grandparent/child learning activity.  I'm learning along with my grandchildren.  We're doing German and Spanish.  It holds their attention and they use the words during the day after viewing it a few times.  When we had a family gathering they prided themselves in greeting family members (some who were German) with ""Guten Tag"" and ""Hola""",1332028800,,379,5.064516129032258
