4602166,4,B0058YPI5K,"Dana Delaney is still carrying the whole show, which she also did last season.  She is a terrific actress so that keeps me watching. I had hoped that she would have a foil in place for this season.  That is all this show needs.  The writers are trying out various characters as foils but no one has clicked yet. The biggest one tried was her blonde woman boss who is now dating the ex husband.  But that has run out of steam as a bone of contention.  So although the other characters are ok, Delaney as the medical examiner in Philadelphia is the whole show.

On an earlier episode this season there was a male investigator with the FBI who was the best foil used to date.  However, how many times can the Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office have a common case with the Philadelphia branch of the FBI?

This time out there is an arson case and we see the many things an medical examiner's arson forensic team can discover from an arson victim's corpse.  It is surprisingly a lot. The other victim is in the hospital and the team is waiting for her to regain consciousness to also give them clues. The forensic team also clashes with the main arson investigation team from the fire department.  These two team members don't even want any other department on the scene.",1319241600,,1270,4.482608695652174

4602212,5,B0058YPI5K,"I found this entire series - starring Dana Delaney as a childishly rebellious while extremely talented (a somewhat standardized female character - which I find unfortunate) medical examiner in her confrontations with the traditionally unimaginative, politically motivated authorities - greatly amusing/entertaining.  Formulaic, but rescued by the talents of Ms. Delaney and by the surprisingly cast Jeri Ryan - a much better actor than I had realized.  I suggest you watch at least one episode to see how you like it, you just might.",1476403200,,533,5.409638554216867

It is nice to see Jerri on NCIS these days and hopefully Dana Delany will be back soon with anew series.  The rest of the cast work with the stars.  There is a nice love interest going on between Delany and her investigator.  Also with Jerri Ryan hooking up with Delany's ex-husband is great T.V.,1430265600,,382,4.277777777777778

4603028,4,B0058YPI5K,"Though the actual DVD package of Season 2 of this highly-rated ABC series was not released until September 18th (2012), there are already plenty of reviews of the series itself - including a nice ""Episode Summary"" by my fellow reviewer Matahari Knows, so there is no reason to repeat that info. But I hope I can add a bit more info on the Home DVD package (I got the DVD, not the Bluray for this title.)

I've never actually watched the series on TV but, rather, discovered it by getting the DVD of Season One. I like Dana Delaney (the rest of the cast were all new to me) and, knowing that the show is set in Philadelphia (where I reside) was an extra incentive. As I pointed out in my review of Season One, there are some establishing shots which were filmed in Philadelphia, but I didn't recognize a lot of the scenes and later learned they were filmed in Rhode Island! I was told that, because Delaney wanted to be back in California, Season Two was filmed there. This becomes obvious in the first episode where the wealthy cul-de-sac where the action takes place looks almost exactly like Wisteria Lane from ""Desperate Housewives"", Delaney's previous series. It goes in further in  that - the first of 20 episodes - when Delaney's character says she ""knows a lot about desperate housewives"". So, yes, I'll admit that my mind did wander when ""continuity issues"" revolving about Philly occurred, but that shouldn't affect others.

The First Season was a mid-season replacement and ran just nine episodes on two discs. This time there are 20 episodes on four DVDS. The bonuses include featurettes on the ""bodies"" used in the show (the show uses a few medical consultants and there's lots of medical talk), a three-part feature on the stunts, the special effects team and how they work, the fashions and costumes, a few ""webisodes"" and the now-requisite "" Blooper Reel"".

As noted by other reviewers, the relationships of the characters are examined in more depth in the scripts this time, while they still try to solve a murder each week in under 43 minutes! (Yes, there are that many minutes of commercials in TV show these days.

Each person who watches the show seems to identify with a different character in the cast and so you'll have your favorite.

I'm glad I found it. I'll wait till Season Three to see if any of the ""cast changes"" mentioned by others in the comments, change the enjoyment of watching the show.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4603032,4,B0058YPI5K,"First of all, I have completely missed season 1, am currently watching season 2 (on Hulu.com, and they don't have season 1 available).  I typically enjoy legal and medical type shows (as long as they don't get too soap opera-y or too unrealistic)

CONS:
Dana Delaney always seems to be the same character in whatever role she's given, which is good if you liked her in everything else she's done (unless, like me, it's starting to wear on you).  In this role she's supposed to have been a neuro-surgeon but now she's a medical examiner (how/why would someone make that career change? maybe that was explained in first season?)  And the city she works for must be rich rich rich because the office space they're all in looks extremely spacious and high budget (completely unrealistic).  She also dresses totally inappropriately for her role, in tight fitting fashionable garb which one would wear for a hot date - complete with insanely high heels (occasionally she does don scrubs while doing autopsies, but not often). Also - there only seems to be 1 case to work on at a time.

PROS:
Pretty good and likable cast. Interesting writing and interesting cases (as you would expect from this type of show).

If you can accept the things I mention in the CONS section, you will probably enjoy this show.  I intend to watch all the episodes I can, in spite of the cons - though I really hope as this show goes on they get a little more realistic with some things.  If my current budget wasn't so tight, I would probably watch season 1 on amazon.com",1341619200,,1543,4.602189781021898

4603084,4,B0058YPI5K,"I am reviewing Body of Proof specifically, but my remarks apply to all Amazon Instant Videos. This production is really five-star, but I have to take off a star because I am hearing-impaired and missed about 20% of the dialog. As far as I know, Amazon does not offer closed captions on any of its Instant Videos, even though the original production for cable TV may have had them. Hearing impairments are going to become far more common as the US population ages (not to mention those induced by MP3 players!). I would probably triple my purchases of Insyant Videos if they included closed captions. Incidentally, closed captions can also be useful to American viewers who are not accustomed to British, Australian or Indian accents.",1336780800,,733,4.872

3. Delaney is a deep character actress and Jerry ( Seven of Nine - cut her teeth in this role and did a great job!!! ) just right for her part. ( JR is so under rated as well )

4603089,5,B0058YPI5K,This was a radical departure from anything this show has done to date.  What looks like a date rape drug related murder instead heralds a rash of hospital admissions of patients frothing blood from the mouth who quickly die.  There is nothing these patients have in common other than being the first victims of what looks like a massively contagious and fatal virus. Then a terrorist steps forth taking credit for the outbreak but Megan notices that his eyes show the same tell tale signs as the other victims and predicts he too will soon be dead.  All of this brings in the CDC and FBI so that all three are trying to figure out what is going on together.  This involves petty squabbles of course over turf.  They have made some discoveries at the close of this first episode but have a long way to go to solve the case in the next episode.,1333065600,,842,4.406451612903226

4603092,4,B0058YPI5K,"The number one thing to rejoice about is that the worst story arc has been deep sixed.  Megan's boss is no longer dating her ex husband.  Meghan's daughter now lives with her and they are just experiencing the usual conflicts, not the former ones with the husband's having sole custody. The ex appears to have moved to the west coast for a teaching post.

On the opposite pole, the supporting characters with potential are becoming more three dimensional.  Her co-workers at the Morgue are developing more facets to their characters.  This episode has all of them working on deaths in the hospital due to a staph infection which must be tracked down.

Meghan is also trying to solve a possible murder case of a lottery winner. The two detectives are by her side and the big guy detective is getting more lovable by the minute.  Tonight he did a little jig at the end!",1323302400,,867,4.590909090909091
4603093,4,B0058YPI5K,"Meghan has to figure out why her young dead pharmaceutical rep lost all of the blood in her body in the space of twenty minutes.  She was found in the water but clearly did not lose all of her blood there.  There are two men she was seeing, a married middle-aged cardiologist and a young oyster shucker bartender.  She dumped the later and was still seeing the former at the time she died.

The usual cast of characters has to figure this out.  The older male detective has an expectant wife so is driving everyone crazy finding the derivation of names for babies.  The younger detective, assigned to Meghan's office, is admired by a new forensics tech who is in turn admired by the young nerdy doctor working for Meghan.  His big (literally) buddy and he, when out on the job, are the funniest part of the show.

There is continual unraveling of the personal lives as well which reaches a conclusion as to one facet...and I was very glad to see that story arc come to an end.",1321488000,,976,4.41340782122905
