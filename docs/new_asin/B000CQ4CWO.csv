8100200,5,B000CQ4CWO,"As teen driving DVDs go, I've seen most of them. And most of them lack substance. This one is head and shoulders above the rest. Used as suggested by the publishers, it may save your child's life one day. There is now an updated version of it called ""The Driving Zone 2"".
Andy Pilgrim does a wonderful job of presenting the real world of driving to the teen in your family. Watch this video with him or her, and you will learn something as well. And look up the Andy Pilgrim Foundation devoted to this cause. It's the best there is.",1335484800,,532,4.2772277227722775
8100201,3,B000CQ4CWO,"The entire DVD was entertaining. Don't get me wrong-it wasn't exciting, but it was entertaining. Most of what they say is ""Don't get distracted"" and ""Don't drink/use drugs and drive"". I personally wouldn't spend $8 dollars for it,because I only think it's worth about $2.",1246320000,5,271,5.044444444444444
8100202,1,B000CQ4CWO,"Bull, and nothing but bull.
Out of the 30 minutes of playing time, about 20 are spent on irrelevant small talk; the rest covers basic advice that is readily available in any driver's manual available for free at your local DMV office.
When I purchased the disk I figured that since it was compiled by ""Driving Professionals"" that it would provide driving insights such as accident avoidance maneuvers and other techniques. I don't need to pay $15 for someone to tell my kids not to drink and drive or not to use cellphones while driving. All that I can tell them myself (and have told them repeatedly), for free!
Adding insult to injury, the footage is poorly produced, most of it looks like made with a budget home video camera.
Don't make rich people richer, don't let these chiselers get your money for nothing. Above all, don't get your kids bored and pis...d at you for making them watch this nonsense, it may prove to be extremely counter productive.",1215561600,6,956,4.662721893491124
