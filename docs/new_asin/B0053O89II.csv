4543229,1,B0053O89II,"I'm so sick of these cheapskates that don't want to put things out on bluray. I've been writing complaining about this trend for a while now, and it looks as tho I'll have to continue to complain bc nobody's listening. GIVE US THE BLURAY DISCS OR GO WITHOUT MY MONEY FOR YOUR SHOWS! I will never download HD versions of tv shows! I can watch them for free on the internet if necessary so please, keep begging to be broke.

So to end my review, the show gets 5 stars. The manufacturers who refuse to release blurays of Suits get 1 star.",1363219200,5,535,4.245098039215686
4543230,5,B0053O89II,"SUITS is smart, sassy, clever, sophisticated, timely and immensely entertaining!  The new series debuted with a full 60 minute story that establishes the characters very solidly, opens pathways for many story lines, and boasts an exceptional cast of fine actors.  Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama!  Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately.

SUITS is a lawyer show.  Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht).  There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector.  This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact.

The dialogue (Aaron Korsh  and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclich&eacute;d, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters.  The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive  development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera.  It will be interesting to watch how Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht grow into our psyches: both are exceptionally fine and provide a spectrum of the lawyer personality we haven't seen on  a series before.  This should be a major hit!  Note: Episode 2 is just as excellent as episode on. Dealing with some fine issues here with a very smart  script and excellent actors.  7/1/11 Grady Harp, June 11",1309305600,8,2486,4.9375

4543292,4,B0053O89II,"Very affordable, quality set.  My only recommendation is that the discs should be labeled by season. The menu on the discs do not note the season either, so I advise to label the discs yourself as you view, otherwise if put back in case out of order, will be difficult to tell which disc is which.",1468540800,,297,4.303571428571429

4543295,2,B0053O89II,Great series. The DVD set just had no option to goto the top menu that allowed to pick different episodes. That made the watching experience very Annoying DVD set for a great series. Buy the seasons individually.,1464134400,3,212,4.756756756756757

4543311,3,B0053O89II,This is a good deal on a 3 season blu-ray....BUT the reasoning is because whoever put this together was on something. The seasons are only indicated by the pictures on the DVD's. NO episodes on any disc. Sooooo ridiculous. Why they put it together like this is beyond my capacity. I'm going to have to use a sharpie to write the seasons on each DVD. The disc's play beautifully on my blu-ray so I gave it 3 stars.,1449100800,5,413,4.3076923076923075

4543317,2,B0053O89II,"Now in it's 5th season, it is still my FAVORITE SHOW!!! I must buy the best set I can, as both my daughters missed first four seasons. I absolutely love this series. I used to like Scandal and Homeland and then they got too weird and some brutal incidents. I love Suits!!!
9/1/15 I DID purchase this 3 season set on AMZ. HOW could they possibly produce a 3 season set with NO season # on any disc. AND NO episode listing to select any particular episode. Unbelievable! Sorry I assumed discs would at the least have a Season ID. So you get this box set of DVDs in order, but do not get them out of order. And when I loan it out!!! What will happen to that ""order""!!",1439942400,9,664,4.115384615384615

-2 stars for the quality of the menus.  White text on a bright white background.  You get the idea.  I hate to give a bad review for Suits because the show is great, but I'm just targeting the quality of the blu ray menus and presentation.  The discs don't list seasons or episodes, you just kinda have to pop one in and hope to land on the episode you're looking for.  Seems cheap, something thrown together in an hour.

Still a great show, and very convenient to watch three seasons straight.",1480204800,3,522,4.319587628865979
