2154366,5,B000305ZYI,"Bonanza is more than a 1960's TV program, it is a national treasure; a snapshot of the history of American pop culture. Bonanza is truly iconic cinema and a reflection of the mindset of that era. The good guys and the bad guys were easily defined in those days, and there were noticeable distinctions between the two. It was also perfectly okay for the good guys to wallop the bad guys as needed, and nobody got sent to anger management class for doing so.

If you are old enough to recall the family sitting around the TV on a weekend night to watch the show, you should enjoy this collection. A blast from the past and a strong link to the golden age of television.",1396656000,,667,4.336

2154368,2,B000305ZYI,First of all I would say I like Bonanza it is one of my favorite old westerns. Second I wouldn't buy this particular dvd of Bonanza again if I had it all to do over. It doesn't have the original music of the Bonanza theme song. Third the dvd it's self doesn't have that clear of a picture. I have dvd's of some Bonanza episodes that I bought at Family Dollar store for a dollar that have the original theme song and a crystal clear picture. I was disappointed in this dvd collection.

2154369,2,B000305ZYI,"This set covers probably the second half of the Season One, and the first episodes of Season Two, which have fallen into the public domain. Paramount didn't renew copyright. The reason for the music isn't the original, is that Paramount keeps its rights over this music. These episodes have been released by many different companies in different configurations and sometimes with substandard picture and sound quality, and by legal necessity with the copyright protected theme song replaced with generic western music. I'd rather buy ""Bonanza The Complete First Season/Second Season"" Value Pack, I have all seasons until Sixth, Best available picture and sound, with the original Bonanza Song.",1393372800,,693,5.425925925925926

2154371,3,B000305ZYI,"Ok, so I wasn't really duped but I was a bit surprised. I was surprised that the episodes looked as if they had been copied onto vhs tape using a vcr and then transferred to dvd. But that wouldn't really be acurate for some editing did tape place. The editing took place as the awesome Bonanza theme song was omitted, to avoid copyright issues, while some lame western sort of song was used in it's place. So the thrilling theme song was absent but the men of the Ponderosa were in fine form as was much of the writing for the episodes, even if at times the episodes were a bit blurry or fuzzy looking. Some of the episodes are quite good in this collection and there are many famous guest stars: Stella Stevens, Claude Akins, Ricardo Montalban, Vic Morrow, David White--(Larry Tate of Bewitched), and many more stars whose names I'd have to look up. I don't fault this collection for what it is NOT because I got the collection for only five dollars. This cheapo collection has whet my appetite to now buy the real thing which will cost much more money.",1388448000,,1054,4.438144329896907

2154374,3,B000305ZYI,"To add to another detailed commentary, I'd like to set a few facts straight to all of those who are now crying 'foul' and 'bootleg' because of their dissatisfaction with the Bonanza collection from Mill Creek.

First of all, the 31 episodes in question, along with the three Wagon Train episodes are in the public domain because copyright registration was not renewed.

One central clearing house has bought up thousands of hours of material that is now within the public domain and sells copies of those prints to resellers such as Mill Creek and many others.

They are forced to use material from old television work prints, vintage movie prints (sometimes 35mm, sometimes 16mm) and even kinescopes (films shot off of a television monitor before videotape) to make transfers... originally to a master tape [in the VHS days] and then to digital data.

They cannot legally purchase truly restored copies from any major studio and simply copy those discs, because those digitally restored copies CAN be re-copyrighted under certain specifics set down by law.

Additionally, there is very little profit in the over-saturated public domain market, so companies try to find new ways of offering more for less, hence video compression... but now many of these sets are double-sided DVDs [which I personally don't care for because of damage risk in handling].

Now about the theme music... and here's the Catch-22...

The thirty-one episodes of Bonanza that are in public domain are actually the STORIES themselves.  However, the theme music is still under active copyright (administered by either BMI or ASCAP) and songwriters, publishers, owners of the music masters and BMI/ASCAP (as representatives of those parties) protect the music against unauthorized duplication and distribution.

They have a legitimate right to request a license (royalties) for the music if reproduced for the consumer market.  In fact, if they wanted to, they could actually PREVENT the issuance of these DVDs, because the incidental music (music used as thematic pieces within the shows) are all under copyright as well!

What it really comes down to is a bunch of whiners who want everything for nothing.  You don't want to shell out for the 'legit' copies (as you call them), but you bitch about the cheapie ones.

Consider this a REFERENCE set of episodes, and when your piggy banks are full, then go buy the 'good versions'.

As for defective copies... unfortunately, that happens at times because of a problem with mastering of the disc used for pressing.  I used to work in the music industry and these things can and often do happen.

Lastly, Mill Creek has been busting their butts to become one of the better budget-line distributors.

They licensed, yes LICENSED the entire syndicated Steve McQueen series ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" and the prints are SUPERB and contain original theme music as well!  They have offered many other packages like this.

Yes, I also have had issues with earlier products of theirs that has either questionable quality or the incessant logo showing up... but in speaking with one of the main players at Mill Creek, the logo issue does not exist on newer releases and the picture quality is both a product of the source material available and the customer demand of more for their money; hence the compression.

There WAS a time when we couldn't even legally own a movie or TV show... so remember, ""you get what you pay for""... If you want higher quality, you gotta PAY for it!",1370649600,,3488,4.970740103270224
2154375,3,B000305ZYI,"The theme music,if it could be called ""music"" at all is grainy and static-y and annoying. They should have just eliminated music all together if the problem is copyright and licensing. There aren't any closed captions; maybe that's the fault of my equipment.

The good thing about this set is that after a very brief FBI page and a quick Mill Creek distribution logo screen, it jumps right into the menu (with the lame two bars of grainy chords playing) and you choose your episode. By now, everyone knows that it's the same 31 episodes that are out of copyright and are in general circulation being repackaged by everyone. For the price, it's the best one.  All other collections are going to feature the same 31 episodes, but the DVD features will differ. No closed caption options on the root menu.

Anyone purchasing this item will get these 31 episodes that everyone else is repackaging; this one seems to be the most straightforward one. None of these 31-episode collections is going to feature the original Bonanza intro music during the beginning and ending credits.",1369785600,,1074,4.826086956521739
2154376,1,B000305ZYI,When I reviewed the Amazon web site it said that the episode I wanted was on this DVD box set. IT WASN'T. I'm very disappointed with the advertising of the product.,1368748800,,164,4.32258064516129

2154384,1,B000305ZYI,"The DVD was POOR quality!!! It was so bad that the Player couldn't play two disc. Do not waste your money, I'm returning mine as soon as I can get to the post office. JUNK,TRASH,WAST of MONEY and TIME !!!",1353888000,,204,4.125
2154385,4,B000305ZYI,"I chose 4 stars rather than 5 because the video image quality of this set wasn't as sharp as the CBS/Paramount re-releases of this series. But those re-releases are 15 to 20 times costlier than Mill Creek Entertainment's ""The Best of Bonanza""!

I've had this 4 DVD set of ""all"" the ""public domain"" episodes of Bonanza for neigh onto 10 years now and can find little or no fault with it. I'll get into the 3 biggest bitches that all of the most negative reviews have to say about this set in a moment. But first I've got to say that everyone who wrote each of these negative reviews has to be a ""still wet behind the ears kid"" of 30 years or less!

Biggest Bitch Number 1; The image quality:

Having had my 54'th birthday a little more than three months ago, I have very crystal clear cognoscente memories of what it was like to rent a movie or a block of TV episodes between the very early 1980's through the mid to late 1990's. During this approximate 15 to 18 year block of time (before DVDs became the ""only game in town""), the only way one could rent anything was on a VHS video cassette. I can easily say that during this same time I paid at least two thousand plus dollars on movie and TV episode rentals.

And of all those VHS rentals I could also say that I had probably got a 100+ tapes whose image quality wasn't up to snuff. Either a previous renter played that movie through a deck with filthy playback heads or the tape had somehow became wrinkled. In any event the image quality of all of Mill Creek Entertainment's ""The Best of Bonanza"" episodes was equal to or exceeded 85 to 90 percent of any of the VHS tape rentals that I've made in the past.

The above statement is just not an ""apples and oranges"" comparison of VHS to DVDs. When one considers the cost, quality, and quantity ratios of this set of discs, their image quality should only be compared to the original broadcasts of this series and not their totally digitally re-mastered counterparts. Counterparts that as I said before cost 15 to 20 times more than this set of Bonanza episodes do.

But to give the devil his due, I haven't quite joined the 21'st century yet either. I watch all my video through a 12+ year old 27 inch standard TV tube analog RCA television set. If I had a large flat screen HD TV it might have made a difference.

As to the much carped about video compression rates found on each of the 4 DVDs in this set. Your getting between 8 and 9 48+ minute episodes of classic western TV shows on each of these discs. You just can't get that much video on a single DVD without ""mashing"" it several times. And you have to remember that this 50+ year old TV series was made back in the good/bad old days when everything was filmed, edited and broadcast via a purely ""analog"" technology! And although the image quality isn't as sharp as the completely digitally re-mastered episodes of a contemporary TV series, I'd bet they're as clear or clearer than when Bonanza was originally broadcast back in the late 1950's. Remember HD TV wasn't even a pipe dream in some of the most forward thinking science fiction writers of the time. 3D TV maybe, but no one that I know of wrote a single syllable as to how clear the resolution of 3D TV might've been!

Biggest Bitches Numbers 2 & 3; Poor audio quality & lousy theme music during the opening/closing credits:

It truly makes me weary to hear someone gripe and bitch about the audio quality of this set. Bonanza's last broadcast episode of the series (1973) was almost a decade away from hearing ""any TV show"" broadcast with a stereo audio track. Granted the audio portion of this DVD set isn't as sharp or clear as any contemporary TV series with all their Dolby or THX enhanced multiple channel stereo. But it is certainly as clear as the clearest amplitude modulated (AM) radio broadcast that you've ever listened to. And consider this. A lot of Amazon's qualified resellers out there are selling this set for well under $10.00. I bought 8 to 10 copies of this set from the $5.00 bargain DVD movie bin at my local Wal-Mart. At these deep discounted prices (it's ""original"" MSRP was $14.95), it begs the questions: ""What in the old ""Billy Hell"" do want for nothing? A couple of free eggs in your suds?!""

Back when ""the powers that be"" let these 31 episodes of Bonanza slip through their ""copyright fingers"", they still managed to hold onto the original ""Bonanza Theme"". So anyone who wanted to republish and distribute any of these now public domain Bonanza episodes, had to come up with something other than the original ""Bonanza Theme"" to resell them . Over the years preceding Mill Creek Entertainment's release of ""The Best of Bonanza"", I've probably bought most of these Bonanza episodes 2 to 3 times. Through as many as 3 to 4 different video publishers. And each of these public domain publishers used the cheapest, tackiest, goofiest and lamest public domain music they could find to ""hawk their wares"".

For a perfect example of the ""cheap and cheesy"", just go to (email me for the URL) and give the video player a click. These boobs actually have the gall to try and sell you all of nine of the very same episodes found in ""The Best of Bonanza"" on 3 DVDs for $29.95!

Everyone would prefer to hear the original Bonanza theme with all their Bonanza episodes. But when it comes to all the public domain Bonanza venders out there, Mill Creek's opening and closing theme music for these Bonanza episodes is the only one fit to listen to. I'd even go as far to say that compared to all the rest of the public domain Bonanza venders, Mill Creek's acoustical base guitar strumming that opens and closes each of these episodes is more than palatable!

A note on Mill Creek Entertainment's customer service:

Of all the copies of this set that I purchased from Wal-Mart, 3 of them turned out to be defective. In each case a single DVD within the set could not be played. Since only one out of the four discs was defective I decided to contact Mill Creek themselves and ask them to replace that single bad disc rather than take them all back to Wal-Mart. Each time I contacted Mill Creek's customer service department, they politely took down my name and address and told me my replacement disc would go out in that same day's mail. I also told these fine folk that I'd gladly return the defective disc along with my Wal-Mart receipt if need be. They assured me that it wasn't necessary.

In a week or less I received a small cardboard cartoon in my post office box. In this cartoon I didn't just get my one bum Bonanza disc replaced, they sent me an entire new ""Best of Bonanza"" set. The depth of this cartoon was deep enough as to have required at least a quart or more of ""Styrofoam Peanuts"" to secure my ""Best of Bonanza"" set. But what did they use instead of any them there ""Styrofoam Peanuts""? Two brand new 3 to 4 DVD video collections! And they did this on all three of those defective Bonanza disc replacements! With no repeats in all those bonus DVD collections! Within all those DVDs I received wonderful collections of The Lone Ranger, The Sisco Kid, The Roy Rogers Show, Zorro, Rin Tin Tin, plus a 4 disc 57 western TV episode collection from 7 or 8 different series. And a 4 disc DVD collection containing the entire first season of the British TV show Robin Hood!

But alas I'm afraid Mill Creek is no longer doing this. The last time I acquired a defective Mill Creek DVD they only replaced the single disc. But in the beginning, when this new company was establishing itself, it was a grand and glorious time to have a defective purchase ""fixed""!",1328400000,,7602,4.474025974025974

2154408,1,B000305ZYI,"I should have been suspicious when I saw how many episodes were contained in this collection on only four discs.  I really began to wonder when I opened the plastic case to find first of all that the four ONE-SIDED discs are put into paper envelopes that fit into a square recess and are not secured at all.  While this is bad enough, what is even worse is what I found when I began to watch ""The Gunman"" on Disc 1.  First of all, the Bonanza theme is nowhere to be found and is replaced by some crummy irrelevent music.  Why I asked myself would they do that?  I had a suspicion.  As I watched ""The Gunmen"", especially as I neared the end of the episode, I realized why the original theme wasn't used and why the episode seemed off.  The episode had been cut for time!  The ""Romeo and Juliet"" part of the episode where the son or daughter of one family secretly meets with the son or daughter of the other family they are feuding against is gone.  The scene where the two fathers go into the saloon to drink to their reconciliation is split into wipes to meld it all together so that it runs shorter.  At this point I turned the DVD off before it had a chance to further turn my stomach.  What the heck?  I have watched another collection of Bonanza episodes that was lent to me in the past and none of this foolishness took place.  The theme was there in its glory.  All of the episodes were in their entirety.  How in the heck do you cut a show that had no nudity, no swearing and only network-approved violence?  Easy, you're an idiot!  I don't care what anyone else says, if the package advertises a certain tv show or a certain movie, I want the original content in its entirety as I remember it.  Period.  I will accept nothing less.  By the way, I e-mailed the company that produces this garbage and they did not respond to me.  What a surprise!  Maybe they are too busy dismembering and destroying another cherished piece of classic television.

2154412,5,B000305ZYI,"Like many people have said, the Bonanza episodes in this set are all available for free online, and the opening theme music is much different than the original. But so what? It's not the manufacturer's fault that the music is different, and the same will be the case with every episode of Bonanza you watch or buy (unless it's being aired on TV). Even online and even on other DVDs the opening music is not what Bonanza fans have come to expect, but the issue there is with copyright. People complaining only about the music shouldn't rate this product with one or two stars, since every version of Bonanza in the public domain has the same music. And as for the episodes being available for free: Why not just pay $10 to have all 34 episodes at your disposal instead of wasting time loading each episode, waiting for it to buffer, getting interrupted by ads, and viewing it in piss-poor quality with a screen several times smaller?

What you see here is what you get: There's no fancy booklet or behind-the-scenes features, but 34 solid episodes from a great show is worth every penny. The DVDs are great and play well, and the quality is what you would expect if you were watching it on TV. The packaging protects each disc and they're easy to take out and replace. An episode guide on the back of the case tells you exactly what disc has which episodes, and simple menus make navigating easy.  I will mention that subtitles are not available, and while this doesn't bother me, I know it will make or break the deal for others.

After playing the discs, however, we saw new scratches in certain areas only and consistently, that indicated the discs were warped and were dragging in the player in the same spots each time around. This has not happened with any of our other DVDs. After one viewing that was the end of them, as the discs were too scratched to play again.

2154421,5,B000305ZYI,"THIS CLASSIC SHOW IS VERY SATISFYING. The show chronicled the weekly adventures of the Cartwright family, headed by wise, thrice-widowed patriarch Ben Cartwright (played by Lorne Greene). He had three sons, each by a different wife: the oldest was the urbane architect Adam Cartwright (played by Pernell Roberts) who built the ranch house; the second was the warm and lovable giant Eric, better known by his nickname: ""Hoss"" (played by Dan Blocker); and the youngest was the hotheaded and impetuous Joseph or ""Little Joe"" (played by Michael Landon). The family's cook was the Chinese immigrant Hop Sing (played by Victor Sen Yung). ""Bonanza"" was considered an atypical western for its time, as the core of the storylines dealt with Ben and his three dissimilar sons, how they cared for one another, their neighbors and their land.

The family lived on a thousand-square-mile ranch called ""The Ponderosa,"" on the shore of Lake Tahoe in Nevada; the name refers to the Ponderosa Pine, common in the West. The nearest town to the Ponderosa was Virginia City, where the Cartwrights would go to converse with Sheriff Roy Coffee (played by veteran actor Ray Teal), or his deputy Clem Foster (Bing Russell). Greene, Roberts, Blocker, and Landon were equal stars. The opening credits would rotate the order among the four stars. As the series advanced, writers began to showcase one or two Cartwrights in each episode, while the others would be seen briefly in the prologue and epilogue. Not only did this provide for more thorough character development, it also gave all four actors more free time.

Originally, the Cartwrights tended to be depicted as put-off by outsiders. Lorne Greene pointed out to the producers that as one of the region's most affluent timber and livestock producers, they had better moderate their clannishness. The producers agreed with this observation and changed the Cartwrights to be more amiable.

Early in the show's history, the thrice widowed Ben Cartwright, recalls each wife in flashback episodes. A recurring situation (which also occurs in the TV western The Big Valley), was that every time one of the Cartwrights became seriously involved with a woman, she died from a malady, was slain, or left with someone else. As with all hit programs, disturbing a successful formula could be a major blunder.

In a few 1964 episodes, Ben has a nephew named Will (Guy Williams aka Zorro), who visits the Ponderosa ranch.[1] He was the son of Ben's deceased brother.",1227484800,,2485,5.053658536585366
2154422,4,B000305ZYI,"This is a 4-Disc compilation of Bonanza TV shows.  The original theme music is not present in the opening credits, for any of the episodes contained therein.  Presumably this is because the music is still under copyright, and perhaps the video company that put this together did not want to pay royalty for the music, as it presumably must.  But of course if they did pay the music royalty, then you probably would not find this gem in the discount-bin at walmart.  As a side note however, if you really miss the theme music (which I missed too), if you pay close attention, you hear it at least once in the background of one of the episodes.  An alternative might be to record the music and play it on your ghetto-blaster every time an episode starts and keep the TV on mute.

I am a fairly new fan to Bonanza.  The TV show was a decade or two before my time, and I did not even know about it before watching it on Saturday mornings last year on ""My Michiana"" TV.  (A local TV station around South Bend IN.)  Although, I was very familiar with lil' Joe from his later work with ""Prairie"" and ""Angel"" and somewhat familiar with Pernell Roberts from his ""Trapper John"" TV show.  Also I remember Lorne Greene from some commercials.

Most of the episodes on these discs are good and I would watch them again.  Some are a little silly, e.g. there is one concerning gypsies which I found hard to believe.  Not only that, lil' Joe falls in love with a bewitched gypsy girl.  This girl, who thinks she's a tree, kills a chicken in Pa's house and does other strange things.  Not only that, but when Joe tells Pa he wants to marry her, Pa does not object.  I found that even more difficult to believe.  Admittedly, she had some good genes, so I guess Pa was looking at the situation from a Cattleman's prespective.

But as it is always in the end, a steady relationship never ensues and so we start fresh with the next episode.  I don't know if this is true for every Bonanza episode (I am new fan) but it seems like you can't go thru an entire epsode where one of the Cartwrights does not shoot somebody.  I have looked at 3 of the 4 discs so far, and in every episode, a Cartwright shoots someone.  Always plenty of action.  And always, the difference between good and evil is crystal clear and the good always triumphs over the bad (and ugly).

Well, there is an episode or two where someone who initially seems all right is really a crook.  In one episode in this set, Claude Akins (another 70's TV star) plays a belligerant US Marshall and cruelly hauls a Ponderosa farmhand back to Los Angeles to face trial.  (This is before the city became known as the ""People's Republic"" of L.A. and although there was lawlessness then, generally there was not lawlessness in the courts as it is now.)  Claude Akins plays in atleast two episodes in the set.  In the other role, he plays a creep.

Lots of violence, but I would recommend it for younger viewers anyway.  No one ever went to a high school and shot it up because they watched too much Bonanza.  That's my guess anyway.  If you want your boy to see some decent role models (tough, individualistic) then there is no harm in exposing him to this.

2154434,5,B000305ZYI,"I picked this up at Wal-Mart in the 2 for $10 DVD bin, and this 4-DVD Bonanza set is the best $5 bucks I've ever spent in my life.  It's now worth $50,000 to me.  I am 35, so I don't remember much about this series growing up, but it really is the best TV show I've ever seen now.  Pick this DVD up today and enjoy the adventures of Ben, Adam, Hoss and Little Joe on your TV.  Oh yeah, Hop Sing too.",1202256000,,399,3.7142857142857144
2154435,4,B000305ZYI,"I really enjoyed the episodes that are on these dvds, however, it does not have the origional theme song. Also, sometimes the picture quality was not that great.",1202169600,,161,4.785714285714286
2154436,1,B000305ZYI,"I was really looking forward to watching this with my sons..  But the problems with the disks, poorly synchronized audio, and lack of original soundtrack and opening score/scenes make this DVD a waste of time and money..  Fortunately more a waste of time as the cost was low..  The opening and soundtrack is an essential  part of the ""Bonanza experience""..",1198540800,,356,4.883333333333334
2154437,5,B000305ZYI,"So let me get this straight - the two previous reviewers would have given this item 5 stars if it had the theme song?  Are you serious?  I understand.  The theme song is famous.  It's a major part of the show.  I get it.  But seriously, it's only maybe 2 minutes of an hour long program.  It's not like the theme song played continuously throughout each episode.  If you turn on the t.v. today to watch one of your favorite shows and you missed the opening theme song are you going to turn it off and say - ""It's just not the same without the theme song.  I can't watch this show tonight.""  If so, you have a serious problem.  Give me a break people.  If the choice is 34 great episodes without the theme song or no DVD at all, I'll take it without the theme song.  Hey, here's an idea.  Go out and buy one of those TV theme song CD's and pop it in your CD player during the opening and closing credits.  Problem solved.  :)  I actually only paid $5 for this DVD (actually it was in a bin labled 2 for $10), so I wasn't expecting a slick, glossy, well put together package.  I wasn't surprised by no theme song, some scratches and some low volume quality.  Basically I got what I paid for - you know?  But for the money, it's a great deal.  I've enjoyed watching these episodes again.  I haven't watched Bonanza in a really long time.  I was surprised by how many of the episodes I actually remembered watching with my grandparents when I was very young.  The price on Amazon is actually a great price for what you are getting.  If it were perfect in every way, you would be paying $70-$80 for it - at least!",1194998400,,1608,4.159609120521172
2154438,2,B000305ZYI,"While I was thrilled at the prospect of having so many Bonanza episodes at one time, the sound quality is poor on one of the discs despite turning the volume up all the way on the television, and there is much freezing and skipping. This is a poor tribute to a great series. The great Westerns like Bonanza and Big Valley (to name but 2), need to be available in high quality DVDs - by season. Big Valley has made a start in this direction and Bonanza needs to be available as well.",1194566400,,482,4.193548387096774
2154439,1,B000305ZYI,"The picture quality of this DvD is ok at best---ive seen better.
The lure of 34 episodes is pretty tempting---however, is it really possible to watch Bonanza without the original music??? I think not.",1184889600,,200,4.911764705882353
2154440,2,B000305ZYI,The sound and picture quality is really good on these DVD's but doesn't have original theme song.,1184803200,,97,4.764705882352941
2154441,4,B000305ZYI,"BONANZA, one of the earliest series filmed in color, was a Sunday night tradition for fourteen seasons on the NBC-TV network. Even when being bounced around the weekly schedule (the show aired on Saturdays, Sundays and Tuesdays over the years), this family-style oater always got good ratings. The stars were Lorne Greene, Pernell Roberts, Michael Landon and Dan Blocker (although Roberts chose to leave less than halfway through the show's 14 season run).

The BEST OF BONANZA DVD box set is a terrific package of classic TV westerns. You get 25 hours of programming for one great low price. This MILL CREEK collection consists of four single-sided dual layer DVDs. There's 31 BONANZA episodes here and three WAGON TRAIN shows. The list of prominent actors who appeared in these (primarily) 1960 programs is quite extensive (see below).

The BEST OF BONANZA is most definitely for all fans of early television and especially TV westerns.

2154442,4,B000305ZYI,"You get your your money's worth on this CD (about 74 minutes of music). It cleverly blends two early Dietrich LPs--

(1)LIVE IN RIO, recorded in 1959 with Bert Bacharach; and

(2)A German-language LP recorded for Columbia Records in November, 1951. Eight of these tracks are on the Sony CD, THE COSMOPOLITAN MARLENE DIETRICH.
