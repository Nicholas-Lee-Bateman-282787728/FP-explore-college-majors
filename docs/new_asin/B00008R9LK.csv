Both videos are perfect quality, and the behind the scenes feature of the ""Nothing At All"" video is great.  Lastly, the picture album included is a nice set of still shots of Santana.  My only complaint, which wasn't enough to knock off a star, was that the videos were letter boxed, not full-screen.",1058832000,8,404,4.506849315068493
7986649,5,B00008R9LK,"Sad to see that the only other reviewer gave this video 1 star because he or she was under the mistaken impression that Avril Lavigne was Santana's guest artist.  Here, Santana teams up with Michelle Branch, perhaps the most talented of the new uber-rock teen queens.  Branch's interpretation of the lyrics belies her young age, and as usual, Santana is in a class by himself.",1057968000,7,376,4.769230769230769
