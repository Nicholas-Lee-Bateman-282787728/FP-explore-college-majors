1033853,4,6305478902,"I was pleasantly surprised by this low-key story of a young gay man facing adult choices for the first time in 1990s New York. The script is literate and nicely avoids the obvious cliches that affect a lot of gay-themed works. With its upbeat ending, it makes a good, conversation provoking stay-at-home date movie. Besides, it's enjoyable to see stars such as Camryn Mannheim and Anthony Rapp before they became famous in ""Law & Order"" and ""Rent."" If you enjoyed Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss or Latter Days, you'll probably like this.",1115856000,13,536,4.9010989010989015
1033854,1,6305478902,"I just finished watching this seemingly endless and pointless film about a young gay documentary filmmaker's pursuit of love.  I found the writing somewhat pedestrian, the camerawork and sound less than adequate and the acting acceptable.  This is an extremely low budget work in severe need of additional editing, both in terms of its verbose script and lengthy scenes.  I'm surprised I stuck with this terribly dull and annoyingly obvious film.",1115510400,13,446,5.253521126760563
1033855,4,6305478902,"I am amazed.  This film was brillaint.  So incredibly well made and beautiful.  I thorougly enjoyed it.  Honestly though, it could have been better, for instance I did not think that Camryn Manheim was all that wondeful in it, but it was still fabulous.  The best thing about this movie though was it's thrilling cast!  All of my favorite people are in it!  We have Anthony Rapp (Mark Cohen in Rent), Michael Rupert (Marvin in Falsettos), John Cameron Mitchell (Writer, director, and title role in Hedwig And The Angry Inch), and Stephen Spinella (Prior Walter from Angels In America).  Wow.  What a fabulous cast!  Any Broadway fan should see this film just for the amazingly talented cast of Broadway actors in it.  Wonderful film.
Peace,

1033856,4,6305478902,"It starts out bumpy, and the low-budget feeling doesn't help, but stay with this ultimately charming film.  Anthony Rapp, who we've watch growing up since he worked for Disney in ""Adventures in Babysitting"" to become a Broadway star in ""Rent"", plays the brooding, still-needs-to-grow-up, David, who is searching for a deeper meaning in life.  If he were to only get off his high horse at the end of the day, he'd realize that he's searching for the very things we're all searching for: love, sex and a feeling of satisfaction in the broader scheme of things. His constant brooding over deeper meanings is made trivial by his constant blunders with the most simple things in life: like listening, observing and understanding.  His self-absorbedness gets him in one sticky situation after the next, but he does learn in the end, what the absolute truths of life are: you are born, you somehow have to get by and then you die.  Everything else is what you make out of it.",995328000,,968,4.744047619047619
1033931,5,6305478902,"I watched this movie years ago and wasn't sure what I had watched. I watched it again this year and found all the characters warm and palpable, so real, in its time and even now as people cycle, go through cycles. Tender in places, rough in others, but a slice of life.  Definitely worth watching.",1463616000,,297,4.4
1033932,2,6305478902,"I am a huge fan of Anthony Rapp so I picked this up. Not the worst movie but it does drag and some of the scenes were uncomfortable to watch (from a quality stand point, not for the subject matter). It is worth a watch once perhaps but it is not a ground breaking movie and left a lot to be desired.",1462838400,,299,3.838709677419355

1033936,1,6305478902,"The movie was dull, plodding, characters were not believable and the ending left you up in the air wondering what was really going to happen. I thought both the leads needed take a step into the real world and get a life. I actually at one point felt some feelings for the female lead when she was delivered the divorcee papers--it was a fleeting feeling that left me within the next 5 minutes. Characters were really one dimensional--which is a  shame because the movie could have used some added interest.  At the 45 minute mark I felt like I had been watching for hours. The movie continued at a very-slow pass, watching grass growing would have been quicker.",1453680000,,662,4.601694915254237

1034005,3,6305478902,"I am a huge fan of Anthony Rapp.  I enjoy his diversity.  ""David Searching"" could have been a great movie if it wasn't for the poor film quality.  The director should have held out for more money before filming it to afford something other than an instamatic camera to film it.  But, you take chances with independent films and I took a chance on this one.  As far as the story, it is lovely.  The characters, all searching for the sometimes impossible ""IT"", comes through with positive ends.  I have no qualms against the characters or the plot.  But the filming of the movie detracts from the emotional ride and impact this movie could have had.  Still, I applaud you, Anthony for your choice, adding to the diverse roles you have chosen.  Bravo and thanks for taking the chance.",1317081600,2,781,4.553956834532374
1034006,4,6305478902,"Anthony Rapp stars in this film as a good looking, rather confused young man named David who is trying to find his way in life in the midst of lifes dificulties and confusion. An aspiring documentary film maker, he gathers views from all the people he meets in life. He is searching for love, belief, his big chance in life and perhaps a lot more but will he ever find the answer he is searching for? Camryn Manheim gives a great performance as Gwen, David's roommate who is doing some rather serious searching of her own following a divorce that she isn't quite ready to put behind her.

I like this one, however it isn't what I expected it to be, nor was it what I was looking for. Yet I watched, and enjoyed with intrigue. It held my attention all the way through in spite of the picture and sound quality not being all that great. Especially the sound which is sometimes a bit hard to pick up on. There were some good black and white scenes as seen through the camera David uses to record most of the encounters he has with people. Afterwards, I felt a strange desire for a cigarette and a nap, thus I was obviously satisfied.

I suppose it's up to each individual viewer as to what the writer is trying to say, but for this viewer I suppose no matter who you are or where you're at in life, we all face certain struggles with which we must come to terms, and can't always change channels as we might wish to do in our cable tv society. A delightful film to watch, with a good mix of comedy and drama to hold your attention. Although the character of David is gay as are a few of his encounters, there is an equal mix of straight people trying to find some stability in their own world. Thus I can't really endorse this as a ""gay film"". It is not a romance story, but it also isn't your average run of the mill coming of age film either.

The acting is superb, and the casting was very good for each part portrayed. If you're looking for something a little different, then this might be one you will enjoy watching. I give it 3 and half stars.",1304380800,4,2047,4.2301790281329925
1034007,5,6305478902,"A Month ago, I had the pleasure of meeting Anthony Rapp, and i told him that I had seen this movie. It took me a few viewings to get the point, but when I did.....!

He spoke to me very lovingly about the making of this film, the low budget, the crew, etc....But he was pleased that I liked it and valued him in this performance....A Must See",1143244800,10,342,4.029411764705882
1034008,4,6305478902,"In the 1997 indie romantic comedy ""David Searching"", openly gay actor Anthony (""Rent"") Rapp is teamed with Camryn (""The Practice"") Manheim as a young gay man and a new divorcee sharing an apartment in Manhattan. Rapp plays David, who moved to NYC to pursue his dreams of becoming a famous filmmaker/documentarian, and also to find ""Mr. Right"" along the way. Neither search is going very well, because David isn't quite sure what he is looking for, nor how to react when

possibilities come along. He and (Manheim's) Gwen settle into a

comfortable living arrangement which actually makes it more difficult for either one to realize they want more out of life, and depression sinks in when they have moments in which this comes to light. Gwen has an affair with a former tenant of the apartment (who still has his keys and just appears on the sofa one day, sleeping off a drinking binge after breaking up with his girlfriend). Meanwhile, David goes through a series of ""dates from hell"", and also makes friends with a female comedian in a local club, who helps him to better see that he

needs to take more chances to achieve his professional and

relationship goals. In time, he learns that he is so concerned about finding the ""deeper meaning of life"" that he has lost perspective in the simple things that make it worth living.

Definitely a low budget indie, which looks older than its age (shot in 1996, but only recently released on DVD for the first time), and starts off rather shaky. But stick with it, and you'll find a quirky, delightful story obviously made best through the talented cast of actors, especially Rapp and Manheim. Has a realistic NYC feel, with characters many viewers can relate to. DVD extras include only a director's commentary, recorded especially for the DVD.",1115942400,23,1791,4.783171521035599
1034009,4,6305478902,"I found this film to be a refreshing change from so much of the standard gay-indie movie fare. From the first frame, when the hero (Anthony Rapp - and how fun is that?) sets out to find his way through love in the big City, DAVID SEARCHING never talks down to the audience or treats us as if we've never in our lives seen another gay film. The wry sensibility that inhabits this urbane romance is really the heart of the film. Plus, there's Camryn Mannheim in a supporting role and a great cameo by Craig Chester. Freshman writer/director Leslie Smith has put together a fun, literate romance his first time out.",1115942400,13,612,4.473214285714286
1034010,4,6305478902,"I really don't hold a lot of high expectations for indies, but I was really surprised by David Searching.  It was a very funny and touching film and I ended up thoroughly enjoying this movie. The performances are great, and some of the cameos are suprising.  Leslie Smith, credited with both writing and directing, did a very decent job for a first film.  I recommend it.",1115942400,17,371,4.590909090909091
7889850,1,6305478902,"Zero budget, wretchedly photographed ""story"" about a dreary 20 something gay Manhattan man with an uninteresting personality trying to find himself. This he does endlessly sitting around talking to people on sets that look like they just showed up in someone's apartment and filmed, with no thought to production design or lighting. It's all talk and nothing of interest is said. A shame, because the cast would all go on to do great things: Anthony Rapp, John Cameron Mitchell, Julie Halston, Camryn Manheim, and many more notable NYC actors. They just didn't have any material to work with, and even if they had, the film looks like low budget porn.",1524268800,,651,4.927272727272728
7889851,4,6305478902,I like this movie.  It is true to life.  I experienced a lot of the same issues in my life when I was a younger gay guy as did the lead character David in this movie.  David was young and lacked experience and he had lots to learn about romance and finding love and relationships.  His ideas about romance and love were idealistic and not based in the reality of how people really behave in everyday real life.  He was looking for a prince charming.  It is true that you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find a prince but even a prince is human and has flaws and is not perfect.  When you find a guy that you like spending time with and he likes spending time with you and it feels good then you spend more time with him and you start on a journey together with him that might only last a short time or could last a lifetime.  You and he will make mistakes and there are no guarantees.  There will be lots of drama along the journey involving  love and fear and negotiating and compromising for as long as the journey (the relationship) lasts.  The future is unwritten.  We write our own future as we move through life day by day.  In this movie David was learning and evolving and growing as a gay guy as he searched for romance and love.  Overall the ending of this movie is hopeful and happy which is nice because so many other gay themed movies have depressing sad endings.,1512432000,,1383,4.1893939393939394

7889854,3,6305478902,"Found it rather involving at first, and in fact managed to watch it all the way through but lost my enthusiasm as it was revealed what a loser David was-- this guy gives geek a bad name. Or is geek a bad name? Okay, whatever. Also found the actor unattractive and dull--found it a stretch that the handsome Michael would have bolted away from all those hot guys to be with boring David. Also found his female roommate pal, played by an actress I usually like, a very unattractive and unpleasant character. In the breakup scene with her lover/sex buddy at the end where she couldn't stop laughing at him and snorting like a pig I wished there was a way for me to smack her. And I equally felt that guy could easily have done much better. Just found the whole thing implausible and the supposedly deep questions rudimentary -- call it the excuses of a dweep for not getting a life. And--oh,yes-- it worked out in the end because one just landed in his lap. Sure that's as plausible as all the rest.",1479859200,,996,4.389189189189189
