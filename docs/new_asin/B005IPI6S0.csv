4709707,5,B005IPI6S0,"REVIEW FOR HALFORD FANS...

First,I want to thanks again to my friend Gianny Painkiller,that made me as gift some money to can buy this video,and also to thanks to Amazon team,that treated me with promptitude into send me the pack,that I ordered the pack,on 10 October,tow days before the birthday of my ex.man who died,but they couldn't fix my order then,cause I got some card problems,so I re-order the pack on 18 October(on my father birthday)with the most law cost tax services,cause that is what i could afford,a reason for which I never bought directly from Halford company,cause their postal taxes are more expensive than their products,anyway,they estimated to send me the pack on 3 November,but I received it on 24 October already,straight from Campbellsville,KY, South Columbia,USA,from the new office they had opened there,that is why probably they didn't had yet enough cartoon for envelopes,and neither enough paper for ,cause they had put the pack into a paper envelope,and the on a piece of paper, on which I neither saw my name,lucky that this was passed on the envelope,otherwise I didn't knew that the pack is for me,due the fact as in our house,live many family members.

Second,i want to congratulate the band,for the idea of recording this dvd,with mixed songs,from three different bands,Halford,Fight and Judas Priest,and from different albums,new and old ones,then I like the big super arena where the band performed,then I like the way how the band palyed,proving for another time,their talent on performing live their songs every time in a different and interesting way,through their technical abilities on their instruments,but through the Rob's God voice ,that still work,even at his age,then I like the way how they changed their instruments for to bring a new sound for every song they played,then I love the way how they has dressed,all of them wearing black(my color)black leather pants,and black -shirts,and full of metal accessories,and Rob in black jeans and a t-shirts from his own store, covered also by a long black dress with a red dragon on backside,then I love the way how the producers done the dvd starting with an advertising anthology of the band past music collection,including not just the Halford work,but the Fight too, continuing with the presentation of song list,and finishing with the presentation of the two videos,Made of Metal and Like there's No Tomorrow"",on the background my favorite song from Made of Metal,""Till the Day I Die"",all through a cool graphics,with the mention that I liked much more the graphic that was edited for Rock In Rio,and War of Words, I also appreciated the sound and watching quality of the dvd,I also liked the cover of the dvd that representing on the face cover,the Rob's profile singing in front of the arena,that looks like an OZN,and on the backside representing the band on stage,and inside presenting us a simple paper with the advertising to their collection,and also I liked the japanese words letters with witch is written the title of the dvd,and finally I liked the disc too,representing the Rob `s profile singing,but...enought,in a word,a dvd that really deserve to be buying,listening and watching.

4709708,2,B005IPI6S0,"I was looking forward to this DVD coming out, but after the reviews here, I will not be buying this one. As the reviewer above states, frames jumping every 2 seconds is dizzying and not for me. I have an Iron Maiden dvd of Rock in Rio that does that, and its not watchable. Gives me a headache with all the fast changes. I have always wondered why they would not film from dead center showing the full stage, so you can see the whole band as they rock out? To me this over editing has ruined many concert dvds. Would you want to watch a football game and only see close-ups of the quarterback and then the receiver catching the ball and nothing else? That's not how you see things when you are at a game or at a concert. I just saw Priest 2 wks ago in Dallas, it was awesome, no close-ups, not fast cutting, it was great watching the whole band interact and rock the place out. Love Halford, but not buying this one. I would love the chance to re-edit this dvd among others, to restore all that was missed due to over editing. One last note: as to the sound, i too have several dvd's where the sound kicks ass on the intro, but once you get to the concert not so much. really wtf are these people thinking?

Want a great dvd concert? Buy Queens Live in Montreal. Excellent camera work, and the sound is incredible. That's how you make a concert dvd and it was filmed in 81.

btw: I am available to re-edit any and all concert dvd's that suck. lol.",1319587200,14,1447,4.164285714285715
4709709,2,B005IPI6S0,"Seriously, I swear I started to feel an epileptic fit coming on by the end of this show. It's actually a really good performance (although Rob sounds kinda rough at the high-end of his range these days), but the ADD editing ruins the whole experience for me. VERY rarely does a frame last for more than 2 seconds before the camera angle changes, and it stays that way - FOR THE ENTIRE SHOW. I've never watched a more visually-fatiguing, headache-inducing live concert video in my entire life.

What a shame, the audio is pretty good for the most part, although I'd agree that the bass is somewhat lacking. I just can't believe a guy like Rob would approve something with this sort of amateur editing as an official release. Adding to my disappointment, it arrived loose in the case, and while I can find no visible scratches on the disc, it freezes up intermittently throughout the video. Sending this one back, may try to see if I can tell them to keep it and put the money towards the new Black Country Communion dvd. Color me vastly disappointed.",1319068800,26,1049,4.579787234042553
4709710,3,B005IPI6S0,Saw Halford last year with this setlist in Chicago House of Blues. Great show! Was very excited to see this come out. This show was a few weeks or so before I saw them in Chicago so I wanted to have this so to relive. Well the video is great. Whoever recoreded the 5.1 hd audio needs to find other work immediately. There is no L.F.E. at all. In other words my subwoofer only detects sound if I switch it to 2 channel. Luckily I have enough tweaks with my reciever to make it sound decent. I have tried many other bluray music discs just to make sure and well it is only this one. When it starts out for all the recent and updated Halford releases including all the remasters it freaking jams. Then the show starts and you are like I can't hear anything? So then you turn it up. Cool well where is the bass? Oh its in the 2 channel. Well that's just great. Lets just go back to vhs. Halford is the greatest unfortunately the audio dude for this is not.,1318550400,14,952,4.123655913978495

8474882,3,B005IPI6S0,"Its a really cool show, but i didn't like the tracklist, even it has a few classics, and the sound its not the better, i bought it with ""Holy diver Live"" by DIO, and comparing with this, the diference of the mixing of sound its amazing, i think that this blu ray it could be better. Thanks anyway",1372204800,,296,4.120689655172414
8474883,4,B005IPI6S0,"These producers (including Steve Harris of Iron Maiden fame) would stop playing with the f'ing camera cuts and lenses and focus on the performances and stop editing every 2 freaking seconds. Quit changing the f'ing camera angles, you do NOT need a camera change every 2 seconds to 5 seconds. Sometimes I'm standing at a small arena and I can see just fine and I'm looking at the performers through binoculars to see how good they're doing.",1370822400,,439,4.714285714285714
8474884,5,B005IPI6S0,Yesterday I received the Blu ray of Halford with enough advance of the deadline. Halford's performance is semlehante to the good times of Judas Priest.,1355443200,,151,5.08
8474885,5,B005IPI6S0,"Haters need to just step aside. Yeah alot of moving and shifting with the cameras. This is the way it is done today. Does not take anything away from the sheer power of The one and only Metal God. After the tragic death of Dio and the retirement of the Scorpions, and the seemingly endless amount of Iron Maiden cashing in on a ""new"" dvd, we as true metal fans are left with what? Another terrible Megadeath album? Another really bad Metallica album? No. We need to be defenders of the faith and stand with the Metal God! This is great! United we stand! True metal lovers buy this. May be the last of it's kind.",1329782400,,611,4.275862068965517
8474886,3,B005IPI6S0,"The sound is 4.5 stars, halford is 5 stars, video edit is 3 stars (change scene every second), and for my taste the song setlist is 2.5 stars there are many fillers here and also they forgot to put more songs from the crucible album ( for me the best of halford), i dislike stupid songs like locked and loaded, cyberworld,thunder and lightning, likes theres no tomorrow, fire and ice and of cousre the commercial made of metal. Where is the mower, speed of sound, and hell razor for me the best cut of the last album , this dvd have 11 good songs and the six worst halford songs. Shame that he have so many good songs. Maybe its the fact that i don't like too much the latest album. Hope these words help you with all repect.",1327968000,,725,4.223021582733813
