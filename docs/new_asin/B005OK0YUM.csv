8481468,5,B005OK0YUM,"I meant to order the CD but ordered the DVD instead.  I saw it as a kid and loved the trumpet music.  Our old TV had an antenna and the picture was snowy, but I was captured by the sound of that trumpet.  I still remember the songs in my head.  In fact, I now play the trumpet in a band.  I bought this for sentimental reasons.  Will probably get the CD too, while they still exist.",1500508800,,382,3.896103896103896
8481469,5,B005OK0YUM,Awesome movie.  The Maynard Ferguson soundtrack pulls you in and allows you to connect with the characters.  I recommend this movie to everyone.,1483401600,,144,5.217391304347826
8481470,4,B005OK0YUM,"This film had a limited release in 1978 and was universally panned by the few critics that bothered to see it.  The Leonard Maltin Movie Guide assigned the film the dreaded BOMB rating dismissing it as treacle.  The film never received a home video release until recently.  For starters the critics are brainless lemmings who wouldn't know a good film if it bit them.  For sure there are mawkish moments on display but they are easily supplanted by legitimately tender ones.  Burt Young and Doug McKeon have definite chemistry that allows the audience to invest their emotions on the fate of their respective characters.  Love the gritty L.A. atmosphere invoked by director Joseph Hanwright as well as the cool riffs conjured by Maynard Ferguson.  Young, who wrote the heartfelt script, is not the most versatile of actors but he's always been a genuine one.  He always keeps it real as  displayed  here and he should be applauded for it and not unjustly castigated.",1441497600,,966,4.871165644171779

8481473,4,B005OK0YUM,"I came on to amazon expecting to see an overwhelming amount of wonderful comments about this move and all I read were a bunch of whiny reviews.

Let me start off by saying that this is a genuinely, sweet film. It's a story about a man's life spiraling down the tube after his entire family is destroyed in a home fire. Burt Young plays the part of a trumpet player at the top of his game. Mind you, you will have to look beyond his trumpet playing and imagine that he is the great trumpet player he's pretending to be. Now, flash forward a few years later, which is supposed to be around twenty years, and we see the same trumpet player down on his luck basically living on the street. Along the way he meets and orphan played by a young Doug McKeon, who would go on to play in some great roles later on. Both people genuinely needed each other and connect immediately. Burt Ward's character basically takes this kid away from an orphanage that doesn't care about him and we see them playing and bonding. However, there is a huge concern. The little boy has a leg that is infected and he doesn't care about it. The leg continues to get worse and his friends tell him that he has to take the boy to the hospital. Maybe 30 years ago you could take a kid to the hospital and get surgery for him with no insurance or money but that won't fly today. That is what happens though. We find out that the boy has an agressive form of cancer and half of his leg must be amputated. The boy doesn't want surgery though. We find out that this is something hereditary and he saw his grandfather get chopped up until there was nothing left. He doesn't want the same to happen to him. Joe (Burt Young) convinces the boy to have the surgery and he tells him that ""he"" wants the surgery for the boy and he will be waiting. The surgery goes off without any issues but the healing is slow. The doctors are worried that the boy will die if he can't find the will the fight for his life. Joe tries everything but the boy won't budge. Joe eventually stops by the hospital to entertain the children at Christmas time. He performs silent night for the children and the boy, whos is laying in bed, hears the playing. He is moved to get up from his bed and use the wheelchair to wheel himself into the room where Joe is playing.

Yes, this is a slow film but I tip my hat to Burt Young. He wrote the screenplay. I related so much to this film because it's all about a father finding a son and a purpose and it's about a boy finding a father and a reason to live. It may never show up on a best film list but it will always have a special place in my heart. If it ever comes on tv please watch it. Then watch On Golden Pond, which came out a few years later, and you will see how much Doug McKeon has grown as an actor. He's played in a few other roles and so has Burt. I think this is the only one that Burt wrote though.",1403568000,2,2893,4.109540636042403
8481474,5,B005OK0YUM,"I saw this movie when it came out years ago, but forgot some of it.  Although its obviously dated(70's) the story is good.",1388793600,2,122,4.304347826086956
8481475,1,B005OK0YUM,"I didn't watch very much of this movie.  I lost interest with the fake playing of a trumpet.  I figured that if that couldn't even be mimed, the story was going to be rather bad.",1357948800,,178,4.057142857142857
8481476,2,B005OK0YUM,Although some of the music was enjoyable... some ... the movie seemed to jump into a depressive mood and stay there. Some mediocre acting and excruciatingly slow pacing make for a too long and dull movie.,1354838400,,204,4.694444444444445
