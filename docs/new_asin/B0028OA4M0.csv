8356480,5,B0028OA4M0,It is good to use subtitles to read what it says. :) I enjoyed the movies so much. Please add the subtitle on every and each of DVD movies.,1367280000,,139,3.8275862068965516
8356481,5,B0028OA4M0,"This box set features 6 DC Animated movies (12 discs). Each is the 2 disc special edition version of each movie. They're the same discs and cases as the U.S. release, the only difference is that WB added little stickers of the Canadian ratings over the U.S. ratings. The movies included are:

 Superman: Doomsday
 Batman: Gotham Knight
 Wonder Woman
 Justice League: The New Frontier
 Green Lantern: First Flight
 Superman/Batman: Public Enemies

All included in a snazzy box!",1339977600,4,476,5.090909090909091
8356482,1,B0028OA4M0,"DC is awesome with their animated films but sometimes they fall short in their release.  C'mon, out of ""6 discs"" (just double layed 3 discs so no cute artwork on the covers) and the movies just being in chronological release order of Superman:Doomsday, Justice League: New Frontier, & Gotham Knight.  In this Marvel wins in multiple movie packs with their Avengers set...heck, Amazon wins with their packs of buy 3 or 4 movies and the price is better...and you will get the better discs.

Not dissin' the films cause they are awesome and I always pray that the live action will meet the quality of these...but seriously.  If they wanna release 3 films, at least be creative like give us a Lauren Montgomery trilogy which would be Wonder Woman, Green Lantern: First Flight (which I think should have been redone exactly for the live action-which would be an awesome Superhero Star Wars feel) and Superman/Batman: Apocalypse (AKA ""Superman/Batman, Vol. 2 Supergirl""). See that wasn't so hard, that was fun and creative if someone is going to release just 3 films.  Here is one for the two film ones...Batman: Gotham Knight & Green Lantern: Emerald Knights since both are the tie in movies for the Christopher Nolan and Martin Campbell films & do that 6 story tie in together thing.  A better release would be 8 films on 8 discs in chrono release order, no double sided wimpy thing going on. Call it: DC Animated Films vol. 1 or something. Avoid Ultimate or Mega this and that, Disney is already having fun with that and their Power Ranger ownership which will forever deny us the original Super Sentai...but that is another adventure topic!

CONCLUSION: Buy the films on their own or the amazon pack deals for a better deal and product.",1317600000,,1734,4.76
8356483,4,B0028OA4M0,"I ordered a product with the same title and same cover box picture on Amazon.ca and it had 6 animated movies and the 2-disc special editions for a total of 12 DVD discs. This Amazon.com product (that has a different ASIN number) seems to have only 3 movies. So it's likely we have 2 different products with the same box art creating confusion. One has 3 movies and space for the 3 missing (Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Superman/Batman public enemies). The other one has the 6.
So to recapitulate,

ASIN: B0028OA4M0 (this page) at the regular price of 69.99$ has 3 movies (Superman Doomsday, New Frontier, Batman Gotham Knight)
ASIN: B002RABPDC has the 6 movies and doesn't seem to be available on Amazon.com as I write this but is available on Amazon.ca

The movies are fine, better than the Marvel animated counterparts of the same period, but a bit on the short side (1h15 each) with decent extras.",1266192000,16,900,4.689873417721519
8356484,1,B0028OA4M0,"This DVD set does NOT contain the six disks mentioned in the above review.  This set contains ONLY SUPERMAN: DOOMSDAY, JUSTICE LEAGUE: NEW FRONTIER and BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT.  Each movie is a double disk and that's where the 6 disks comes from in the product description.  I'm returning my set.",1265846400,44,294,4.84
