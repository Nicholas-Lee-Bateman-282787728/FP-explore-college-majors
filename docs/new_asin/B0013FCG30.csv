8250671,2,B0013FCG30,"The photo that is shown on this product from Amazon is not what you will receive and the studio releasing this  3 pack is not Lone Star Productions as listed in the product info by Amazon.  This product info is misleading at best  and at worst is downright wrong.
The studio releasing these films is EASTWEST DVD . THERE ARE MANY PUBLIC DOMAIN COPIES BY DIFFERENT STUDIOS WHICH ARE BETTER , except for Range Feud- which is not available from many distributors.  The problem with EASTWEST's print is that the source film has been spliced frequently in several parts of the total film,resulting in the audio sound missing words,  which is quite anoying after awhile. Amazon is extremely over priced for the value- which is somewhat unusual. The Mr. Fat prints are probably much better for the other films listed, or even some are better on Mill Creek or Platinum (which are still available by Echobridge Studios).",1366329600,2,911,4.777070063694268
