I watch it with her and even thought that is not my style of music, it is very good and enjoyable to watch and listen to!
This is one of his best shows!",1485648000,,326,4.0625

I would recommend it especially to anyone who would like to try it.
I have the Rock n Roll DVD , and I really love it. HE sings all the 50's songs. THat is the songs and era I grew up listening to.

I would not change anything about this DVD.
