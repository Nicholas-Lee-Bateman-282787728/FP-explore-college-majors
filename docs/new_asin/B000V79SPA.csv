 This is a rousing picture about the in's and out's of power at both the personal level and the political level.  Abhishek is fantastic as a street rat gone to ground . His brother abandoned him at a bus station as a child and he's been in and out of jail for years. He's married to Rani and is a thug and extortioner by trade. Rani has dreams of reforming him into a house cat; if I give him unconditional love he will reform and be the man I need him to be.  Abhi and Rani are fantastic at conveying the undiluted desperate situation of the working class background (Rani) vs the survival instincts of the gutter rat (Abhi). She's moderately educated and has basically had a strong moral upbringing . She tries her best to make her husband be the better person she sees in him when he looks at her with love in his eyes. She begs her father to offer her husband a job; he uses the job as an opportunity to extort money. He's been abandoned and damaged from an early age . He survived all these years using a cunning mind and his fists . Morals are for people who can afford them. He's tired of crumbs. He wants the whole buffet and by hook or by crook he will make sure he gets it this time.  When the same brother that abandoned him at the bus station shows up again and offers him a job as a political rally thugs it's just the icing on the cake for him. While this story is about politics and it's misuses, what you come away with at the end are the characters' struggles from within for good vs evil. Each character is introduced and then a back story is quickly shown to pull them all together . How their own personal destinies are dooming them to cross paths to the possible destruction of all of them .

 Ajay Devgan is riveting  as the political piledriver. He wants to make the world a better place and he's willing to do it one village at a time with hard work and courage. He's almost been killed twice by the reining politico. They keep trying and he keeps fighting . With bare knuckles and a strong will he will fight you for the future of India. Unlike Abhishek's character , he believes he can make a better world for his future children, if he can stay alive long enough to marry his fiance.  His and Vivek's characters make sure that you don't walk away from this film without feeling like you were a bigger part of something. Something worth fighting for. Something besides money and power.

 As always watch it and judge for yourself. I bought this one and it's a great copy. BY Raaga Megastore FULFILLED BY AMAZON.  Free 2 day shipping for prime members and was only 7.99 . English subtitles .",1336608000,5,2621,4.274747474747475
