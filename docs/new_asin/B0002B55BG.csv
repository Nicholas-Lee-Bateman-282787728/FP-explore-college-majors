8025536,5,B0002B55BG,"Unbelievable one person performance by Doug Barry, he captured the details of the passion to a higher degree than Mel Gibson in his Passion movie. The message is clear and point on about Christ's mission on earth from God.",1457568000,,222,4.717948717948718

8025540,5,B0002B55BG,Doug's portrayal of the Passion of Christ is filled with his personal passion and love for Christ!  A must watch for Catholics and Christians!,1357344000,,142,4.916666666666667
8025541,5,B0002B55BG,"The Passion is a must see before Christmas or Easter, or before any Holiday.  Doug Barry is an amazing actor; not many could remember all of the lines he has mastered or portray with ""passion"" the different characters, along with their voices that he plays!  The Passion is indeed a classic family film that everyone should see; Doug Barry makes this whole production come alive!  Mel Gibson's film, ""The Passion of the Christ,"" has its place; however, if you want to really experience what transpired in the garden of Gethsemane or at Calvary, see this film!!!",1352073600,,561,4.822916666666667
8025542,5,B0002B55BG,"This was a magnificant performance of the passion of Jesus Christ. Doug's voices and acting wonderfully portrays various characters in the life of Christ and makes you forget it is actually a one man show. He sketches various elements of Christ's life up to the Passion then focuses most of the time on the sorrowful mysteries. It takes you just past the crucifixion to Jesus' broken and lifeless body laying on the lap of his mother. It is convicting as you realize through his acting that it is our sins today, yesterday and tomorrow, that led/lead to the horror of the Christ's passion. And, with that, the realization of the great immeasurable love of this Savior, Creator of the universe and all in it, who freely laid down his life for love of us.  I highly recommend this.",1236211200,4,779,4.644927536231884
