I was very sad to find there is no soundtrack to this movie but I have found a couple of the artists names that have songs on this movie if anyone is wondering. One of the songs ""One Night"" is from The Corrs and another song that is played at the end of the movie is called ""Digge Dime"" is from Burlap to Cashmere. You can find those songs on CD's here on Amazon. Check them out! Otherwise enjoy watching the movie over and over again like do. Wish they would release this on DVD at some point.",1043452800,20,562,4.026785714285714
1400613,5,B000056VOW,"I just finished seeing ""Mad About Mambo"" on television this morning - this movie was delightful, funny, and overall, an excellent show.  I especially enjoyed the scenes where Keri Russell and William Ash were dancing - Keri was elegant and graceful, and William wasn't too shabby either.  Overall, this movie was one of the best ""Strictly Ballroom"" -esque movies that I have ever seen.",1034380800,,385,5.0
1400614,3,B000056VOW,"I like ballroom dancing, and that's what I'm commenting on mostly. The plot is pretty typical teen romance -- boy gets girl. Not too bad, not too good.
Unfortunately, neither ""Lucy"" nor ""Danny"" could actually perform what they were supposedly dancing. ""Lucy"" at least could do a few spins and looked like she had taken some dance lessons. ""Danny"" looked pretty bad as a Latin dancer. In the beginning of the movie I thought he was doing it on purpose. But his dance skill didn't improve even in the finale. That's why the dance sequence was edited into mostly upper body and head shots, even though the action of Latin dancing is below the chest level.
Incidentally, the dancing feathered in the movie were samba and rumba. It would be better called Mad About Samba or Mad About Latin Dancing.",1027900800,6,793,4.671428571428572
1400615,4,B000056VOW,"When I first saw this movie I thought it was pretty silly. But I have to admit I looked forward to watching it again. Whenever I see it the movie gets better every time. The story's really cute- an Irish soccer player falls for a dancer (Keri Russell) whom he then tries to win over. Of course, the ending's very obvious but when you're in the mood for a romatic comedy who cares?",1011657600,2,380,4.219178082191781
1400616,5,B000056VOW,"It was funny and it had a spin on it. I loved it, I thought it was a grate dance movie. I say this is a must see weather you are a dancer lover or even a dancer hatter you still will enjoy this movie.",997747200,2,200,3.466666666666667

7932733,1,B000056VOW,"I liked Keri Russell in a few other things & enjoy dance movies, so I thought I'd like this. The lead in this movie is the weakest actor in the movie. Supporting characters were more likeable & better acted than he was. The lead character breaks another guys foot, then knowingly persisted to steal his girlfriend, even though she told him no several times. The original boyfriend isn't depicted as being unpleasant at all until the very end of the movie out of nowhere. Kerri's character is a rich girl who says she wants to dance because it's something she can do on her own without her father's help. Apparently she forgot about the cost of: private lessons, dance costumes, competition entry fees & car to do all this. Not to mention the exposure her gave her at the finale. The dancing, especially the leads was extremely amateur & they didn't use body doubles. He didn't improve from the first time to the finale. Football fans would not cheer for such a thing at all. Hockey players hate figure skating, so why would it be different here. The chemistry between the two lead actors was utterly unconvincing. If cheating on your boyfriend, being a spoiled brat & dancing badly is your thing, you'll like this movie.",1385337600,,1220,4.652777777777778

7932735,5,B000056VOW,"This is an awesome movie!! I would recommend this to anyone who Loves romance movies. It was hard to get, had to buy the vhs one.",1379462400,,129,4.0
7932736,1,B000056VOW,Couldn't view DVD. The DVD was for Eastern Europe. Would like to return it and receive a copy that could be viewed in the United States.,1372982400,,136,4.269230769230769
7932737,5,B000056VOW,I can watch this movie again and again and never get tired from it! Very pleasant dancing movie with excellent sence of humor! Highly recomend!,1358380800,,143,4.76
7932738,2,B000056VOW,"""Ok not only was the VHS Movie advertise a movie as being in VERY GOOD condition when selling it....YES I know its Prev. Used but AT LEAST have the respect to REWIND the MOVIE! I got the movie & it clearly shows it was watched & NEVER rewound. "" ALSO for paying almost $23.00 for this tape as again ""VERY GOOD"" condition, I found the sound quality to be BAD & some lines throughout the movie....I would NOT have labled this movie ""MAD ABOUT MAMBO"" as Very Good Condition & would NEVER have PAID that price for the quality I did get!",1297728000,,532,4.2254901960784315
7932739,3,B000056VOW,"This movie about a working-class Irish soccer player and an upper-class girl who loves to dance is the equivalent of a good beach read. It is light, amusing fare that will let you escape your own life for awhile. Girl has an upper-class boyfriend, but doesn't love him. Boy has a dream and an eye for the girl. Dance brings them together. Happy ending, complete with fireworks. It is another take on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Dancing/dp/B0000DIXDR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Dancing</a>&nbsp;without the dirt. It's sweet and a little silly, but a spirited feel-good romp.",1245024000,,632,6.112359550561798
7932740,5,B000056VOW,"Okay, so maybe you wouldn't watch the movie for the dancing alone -- though that part of it is fun. But the story is so touching. Check out how noble and selfless Danny's love is: how fearlessly he pursues uptown girl Lucy, but without allowing himself to be treated like a doormat. His character alone is worth watching the movie 100 times for...but the dancing and fun Latin beats add a lot as well.",1186704000,2,401,4.4324324324324325
7932741,3,B000056VOW,"Cute romantic comedy - watch it for the romance, for the soccer, for the actors, but don't watch it for the dancing.  You ballroom people will notice right away that there is no mambo in the movie, mostly samba and a bit of rumba.  That said, you don't see much of the dancing: the cameras focus mostly on the faces and leave you wondering about the footwork.  Also, very limited choreography - same steps over and over throughout the film.

Nevertheless, it's a fun movie overall, and the acting is very good.",1133740800,3,510,4.510869565217392
