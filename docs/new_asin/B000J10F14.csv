2665906,5,B000J10F14,"Directed by Spike Lee, this documentary bears witness to the tragedy of Katrina, the ineptitude of the U.S. government, and the very human drama that affected so many people in the city of New Orleans.  Using images that will tear at your heartstrings, archival footage, music and lots of individual stories, this is a full exploration of exactly what happened.

There's lots of anger here, and lots of sadness.  Death  and horror seem to be everywhere  There's a man who tells the story of how his elderly mother died while they were seeking immediate shelter in the Superdome and how, four days later when he was finally evacuated he had to leave her body.  People were herded like animals into the Superdome for days and days.  There was no water, no food, no working bathrooms.  It was hot and humid.  There was no escape.  Other people were left on ramps above the highways and when they tried to walk off, they were met with guns from residents who didn't want them in their neighborhood.  Reports of looting were everywhere.  And the mayor and governor were arguing about what had to be done.  Where was the U.S. government?  Why were they able to send help to victims of the Tsunami the year before in Indonesia and could not send troops to help their own people.

Every single aspect of the Katrina story is horrible. There's even a segment when the cameras focused on the bloated bodies found in the aftermath.  Later, even after the worst was over, the trailers that people were promised took six months to get.  And families were split up when they were evacuated to other states.  Then, the insurance companies reneged on paying insurance claims.  It was just one awful thing after another.

Some of it can be blamed on the endemic racism that has always been present in New Orleans.  Most of the people in the film who were affected the worst were African Americans, although there certainly were many whites with equally horrible stories.  Mostly, though, all of these people were poor.  They didn't have the means to run from the city as they didn't own cars.  All of them had been through hurricanes before.  They had sat them out then.  They had survived.  But Katrina was different.

Applause to Spike Lee for making this film!  He doesn't appear in it but it certainly shows his unique view of the world.  Of course I had seen news footage in the past and I remember following the story as it was happening.  But this film took not only summed it all up, it added historical perspective and introduced individuals who, by the end of the program, I could identify with.

Yes, this documentary will haunt your dreams.  You will be saddened.  But see it anyway.  Just be prepared for the worst.",1160265600,12,2711,4.635789473684211
2665907,4,B000J10F14,"This recounts the run-up and events of and after Hurricane Katrina as some residents evacuate while others have no means to leave or will not leave as nothing ever bad happens. What happens next is a complete governmental fail as people die and survivors aspire for rescue and some are threated as there are some whop take advantage of a lawless time. False claims lead to desperate situations. Many interviews and actual footage, including images from inside the Super Dome. Insightful, swearing.",1490486400,,497,5.073170731707317
2665908,5,B000J10F14,"Here we are more than 10 years after Katrina, and while the city's tourism industry says the city has recovered and has moved beyond the hurricane's impacts, anyone who ventures outside the French Quarter or the Convention District, or along St. Charles can see that recovery is far from homogeneous.  A trip to the North Ward and other ""forgotten"" neighborhoods will tell you that the scars have far from healed.  These are important and human stories that linger even today and this series does them the justice they deserve.

2665915,5,B000J10F14,I think it was a great documentary that explained in detail from beginning to end of what happened to the people of New Orleans.  It exposed the government as a whole for their lack of urgency to totally assist people of this country in a time of crisis.  It also helped the hurricane victims to realize that they need a detailed contingency plan in place in the event of a natural disaster.,1481932800,,391,4.416666666666667
2665916,5,B000J10F14,"I love to watch documentaries and very few stay with me once they are done. But this stayed with me for days! It makes you feel like you lived in NOLA at the time of Katrina, like you had friends or family there.
I visited NOLA for the 1st time this year and it was amazing;  while watching this I had to remind myself that it was not recent because I wanted to fly down to help.
I recommend this as a must watch. Ao many people donated money and most of it seems to have gone anywhere but nola. What they needed was actual help from people.",1481760000,2,541,4.0092592592592595

2665924,5,B000J10F14,"I've only gotten through the first episode, but so far, I'm impressed. The accounts/interviews are authentic, varied, and moving. There also is some ""fresh"" footage, not just iconic images we've seen over and over.
Depending on your level of compassion and knowledge of Katrina, you'll be ashamed--maybe even shocked-- to see again how badly things were handled before, during, and after the storm. The film's agenda isn't surprising if you know Spike Lee's work: The gap between ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" in this country is both deep and wide. How you're treated--even on the most basic human level--is based on which of those two groups you fall in.
Regardless of your political views, there are many lessons to be learned here. We'd better learn them because tomorrow the next ""big one"" could be where you live.",1476662400,,812,5.022222222222222

Its sad and I lost my home 1 month later for Rita; It was a nightmare you just don't forget when you go back after 4 weeks and nothing is there.  We were able to leave and I think only a few deaths were reported.  A lot of people in N.O. were not able to afford to leave or didn't have the transportation.  The people that stayed suffered and there were so many deaths.  I cried when I saw people in the movie begging for food and water.  Our government failed for sure.,1474243200,2,579,3.991304347826087

It clearly recounts the devastating events and effects from Katrina, the consequence of the failing levees, the undue suffering of the people, and the shameful, neglectful and slow response from the federal government. But, this documentary also showed the unwavering resilience of New Orleans residents and the humanity of those americans who DID come immediately to help, to rescue and to assist when the government did not seem to care.  Touching and insightful. It should have won the EMMY.",1470873600,,554,5.087912087912088

2665961,5,B000J10F14,"Brilliant and shocking documentary on what happened to the largely black people of New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina hit the city in 2005. Everyone should watch this documentary. It is a shocking indictment of the US Federal Government and the lack of support by President Bush's administration and the Federal Agencies to react quickly and support the people of New Orleans. The documentary is riveting, informative outspoken and makes you very angry. The chaos and lack of preparation by the authorities when the hurricane hits the city is not really surprising but still very shocking. The chaos and distress of the thousands of people stranded at the New Orleans Dome is particularly harrowing and mind boggling, with thousands of vulnerable sick people and old people, young children spending days without food water and washing facilities.

The documentary shows clearly how quickly society can quickly break down into anarchy and disorder when water, food, power and sanitation are not available in large cities. It is a very sobering experience.

Well done Spike Lee, this must be one of the best and most hard hitting American documentaries ever made and it should not be easy viewing for American Politicians and Federal authorities given the degree of failure before, during and after Hurricane Katrina.

Should be mandatory viewing in all US Schools, Colleges and Political Studies classes. Example lesson in How not to manage and support a major catastrophe or disaster.",1459814400,,1484,5.226890756302521

2666018,5,B000J10F14,"A requiem can be defined as a ceremonious remembrance for a passing; a memorial of sorts. In my opinion, Spike Lees choice of naming this documentary A Requiem in Four Acts, serves to recognize the devastation caused not only by the Hurricane Katrina, but by what many saw as negligence by federal and local authorities in regards to preparing for the storm and evacuating people before its landfall. Lee collects firsthand accounts from residents, authorities and family members that detail the destruction that ensued and also includes footage of news coverage and analysis of weather and emergency experts to provide objective evidence for why much of the human loss could have been avoided. This requiem could also been seen as a way to provide a form of justice for the affected residents who for decades have felt distrust against the state and federal governments during times of natural disaster.
There was some blame put on many residents who believed that they could ride out the storm citing previous hurricanes such as 1965s Hurricane Betsy, which had also directly hit the area. The government, however, must be held accountable for not enforcing the mandatory evacuation that was declared. Many were trapped for days on the streets and the roofs of their homes and also held at the Super Dome convention center with no signs of any impending release in terms of evacuation. Many did not have the funds, transportation or a location to evacuate to so they had no means to follow the evacuation orders. It is the job of the government to assist those who were not able to evacuate in time, which was not properly done. State officials prioritized business districts and communities first in terms of aid and evacuation, protecting their economic interests while neglecting the citizens who would have needed help the most (When the Levees Broke, 2006).
 The major downfall of the storm was not necessarily the damaging winds, but the massive flooding that took place throughout the Gulf and especially the city of New Orleans. Two major flood events immediately after the initial hit were the flooding of the Florida Avenue and 17th street areas as water from Lake Pontchartrain swelled over embankments and flooded the streets (When the Levees Broke, 2006). Emergency officials addressed the crisis by relocating residents to shelter of last resort, areas that were capable of housing individuals for a short amount of days before more resourceful help arrived in the form of the federal government. Unfortunately such response was neither immediate nor speedy, as the city received no true signs of federal assistance for at least four days. The images from the aftermath of Katrina were devastating. Many compared the conditions to those of a region at a time of war (Levees, 2006).
In the weeks following the storm, most of the victims had relocated to neighboring states with reports of 12,000 moving to Tennessee, 20,000 to Arkansas, and 150,000 to Texas with numbers rising each day (Levees, 2006). In major cities with concentrated urban areas such as Houston, a rise of violence perpetrated by small groups of degenerate evacuees took place leading to law enforcement to increase resources and manpower in response. Reports of over a dozen Louisiana evacuees being suspects in murders in Houston intensified the rift between migrants and Texans as well as strengthened racial tensions in the city (Levees, 2006). The evacuees were dispersed indiscriminately which led to broken homes and missing relatives being a constant narrative. For months, thousands of people had no way to contact missing friends and relatives or to find out information on the state of their homes and communities. Tensions and levels of distrust between the black community and the federal government increased as no suitable explanation for the President or members of his administration were ever reached. This tension was expressed to a worldwide audience infamously by Kanye West who, while giving a speech for a fundraiser for Katrina relief, decided to go off script saying, George Bush doesnt care about black people (Levees, 2006). His statement represented the voices of many who felt betrayed and believed that because the areas affected by the storm were primarily black, the federal government did not distinguish the crisis as a priority.
The President did not visit New Orleans until two weeks after Katrina, further offending the victims who would never forget his negligence to the crisis. I believe that the federal government and the Bush administration should be primarily held at fault for unnecessary lost of life and illness following the storm. State officials have gone on recorded expressing their repulse at the lack of timely federal response (Levees, 2006). The Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, was established to provide relief to the nation in times of disaster but was not present for days and once the evacuees were displaced, redacted funds that aided victims in paying for rent and food. Residents of Louisiana have stated that the aftermath [was] worse than the actual levees breaking (Levees, 2006). The victims were not properly aided once evacuated and could not establish themselves in the new states they found refuge in. The evacuees were essentially left without a home and away from families with their deep-rooted cultural ties to New Orleans left unsatisfied. The delegation of the evacuees as refugees by major news networks further established them as strangers in their new communities making them feel as if they were not taxpaying American citizens. Reverend Al Sharpton, representing the Congressional Black Caucus, would go on to address the press calling for an end to the insensitive classification of the evacuees as refugees (Levees, 2006).
Documentaries are often made with political intentions; however, a good documentary takes its content from objective sources and firsthand accounts and images. I believe that documentaries are useful for teaching history because they are a medium that can reach a variety of audience in many cases more than a collective research document would. Historians should be wary of documentaries that do not include all forms of sources, especially primary accounts. When the Levees Broke was done effectively because the information was presented and collected from primary sources that were directly affected by the events. Rather than only using news coverage or official reports after the fact as sources, Lee includes the voices of the victim, the evacuees, local law enforcement and analyst to create a true interpretation of the events proceeding, during and after Hurricane Katrina.",1443744000,,6687,5.2146840148698885

Through extensive interviews with the citizens and political players at the center of this tragedy the film paints a pretty clear picture of all that went wrong. This was one the most shameful and disgraceful events in the history of the country.  What a sad, embarrassing, and ultimately maddening series of bureaucratic nightmares, blame lies all over, but perhaps the lowest point in history of the Feds. I don't know what to think about the matter of race, but I know for sure economic stature played a major role here as it always unfortunately does. If it was their estates and snobby country clubs that were under eight feet of water the response would have been a whole lot different. I have zero doubt about that much. This film provokes a lot of emotion even now 10 years removed. I think it's Spike Lee's best work yet.",1439078400,,947,4.603550295857988

2666138,5,B000J10F14,"Actual review:  Spike Lee has collected shocking footage and interviews with an impressive list of people showing and discussing this natural disaster and, far worse, the human disaster that was allowed to unfold as tens of thousands, poor, sick, elderly people were left stranded on the streets of New Orleans for an entire week after the worst hurricane ever to his the region.
  This is NOT family viewing, because the footage of dead people floating in the water, not to mention much cussing by understandably very upset citizen for were forsaken by their National Government.
  It's a bit long but most of it is absolutely riveting.
  Quibbling over the quality and style of the 'film making' seems utterly beside the point when attempting to document a tragedy of this magnitude, especially because so much of it was preventable.  One does not watch a documentary like this for aesthetic reasons.  Some may wonder why Lee interviews musicians for example.  This is Lee's way of showing the culture inherent in the people of New Orleans is every bit as important to save as their lives.

The editorial part:
Note:  (In so much as an editorial of a documentary of history can contain 'spoilers' - a few of the most outrageous points are discussed below.  If you want to find out in the film instead, watch that first.)
======================================================================================
  It is amazing that for an entire week the federal government pretended they 'didn't have enough information' to know what was happening.  CNN could find out, but not the president?  This could have been a heroic moment for president Bush but he did what the rich often do when they encounter poor people in trouble, just look the other direction.  Bush didn't reach out to other countries - he could have gotten help.  Bush proved, in the worst possible way, that the wealthy really don't care about the suffering of the poor.

  Lee documents the system disenfranchisement of an entire city full of poor people, mostly of color.  If Katrina had happened in New England, do you really think it would have taken a week  (and seven days of outraged nation shaming Bush publicly) to get just food and water to tens of thousands of people?  (To be fair Spike Lee spreads the blame around sufficiently and does not just blame President Bush or even just Michael 'You're doing a heck of a job Brownie' Brown.)  The way this city was treated one would think New Orleans was some out-of-the-way place, not the incredible trove of unique American culture such as Jazz and Cajun people completely unique and vital to the American Experience.  There is a reason there is a New Orleans Square in Disneyland.

  The people of New Orleans were heroic in their calm and their helping of one another - but were all punished because of the actions of a few looters.  Our National Guard was off in Iraq making life easier for oil companies, leaving the local police to choose to save lives over merchandise and the city was punished for choosing lives.  (Because in America we often seem to value things over human lives.)  More amazing is that the people when the victims started to walk out of the city, to walk freely on U.S. soil, as is their right, they were turned back at the bridge by people with guns.  The citizens of New Orleans were imprisoned in a disaster area.  This was allowed to happen - all because one city feared some poor victims of color!  Like they would all suddenly start looting if allowed to pass through, as if offering food and water to people was too much to ask!

When the Administration finally did respond the situation had degenerated so badly that everything was rushed that children were separated from their own families.  Cleaning up the humiliating mess the administration allowed to develop was a bigger priority than keeping families united.

  If you only heard what happened in the papers  or were too young to be aware or concerned, watch and be shocked than that so many people, in such dire need could be so blatantly neglected for so long in the wealthiest country on the planet.  And why? Because certain wealthy individuals find the squalor perpetuated by their corrupt and bigoted policies .... distasteful and inconvenient.  Too bad we can't all afford to live in the White House.

  It's subtitled ""Requiem for an American City because, while the city is still there, their sense of belonging to America as a necessary and vital part died that week, and in the years after as the city and its school system still reels from the huge economic shock reverberating to this day.
  I was very pleased to find out that the Coast Guard knew and knows how to do their jobs.  They were in there the next day!",1437523200,,4746,4.791615289765721

Living below sea level unfortunately is a risky proposition and the possibility of another bad hurricane is probable.  However, it shouldn't stop such a great cultured city from rebuilding as this is where these people were born and this is where they want to live their lives and they should have that right.

Bush led federal government until 4 days after the hurricane first hit New Orleans. How much money is immediately taken out of your paycheck for federal taxes well part of that money is supposed to cover natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes the Bush led federal government was both incompetent and callous in dealing with the suffering victims (not refugees) of HURRICANE KATRINA. As far as I'm concerned this is SPIKE LEES' finest piece of work ever he does a masterful job of showcasing the pain, desperation, frustration, and anguish of the KATRINA victims, he also vividly points out who those people (angels of mercy) were who did come out immediately to offer assistance and aid to these suffering victims of HURRICANE KATRINA, the next time somebody says America is the greatest country in the world tell them to buy and watch this DVD film.",1423353600,,1184,4.954773869346734

Spike Lee, the director and producer, let the images and the effected people speak for themselves, making the devastation and the government neglect all the more poignant.  It is hard to believe how many people were hurt, and how incompetent FEMA was in the days leading up to and following the storm.  There are many who should be ashamed of themselves.  On the other hand, there were many heroes.  People who exhausted themselves helping others to safety, and people who used their considerable status not to gain personal advantage but to help get a humanitarian job done, folks like Sean Penn.

The only thing I really disagree with Spike is that this being a racial thing, it was not if you watch there are just as many white people in that dome I do however agree that during that year we evacuated so many times it was too expensive so when Katrina was coming everyone was tired of evacuating and taking hours just to get out of town what would usually take only an hour. That was the first time we ever used the contraflow and it worked for the people of new orleans who where leaving , but when Mississippi seen they had to leave it jammed up Biloxi so they could not get out in time. I do remember the shock of coming home we had no red lights and homes where blown down or completely under water and the city looked like a bomb went off the building and everything was grey with dirt.
I wish his focus would have been more on the devastation on the flood and Katrina than it just being a black issue because there where whites ,spanish and oriental people there also and he totally missed saint bernard parish there housed where flooded and demolished still to this day those people have no home to go to or are too afraid to go back.",1407715200,2,1258,4.245833333333334

The U.S. leaders at all levels failed Americans citizens in New Orleans after the levees broke. And then, to be called ""refugees"" afterwards-adding insult to injury? Rock bottom man, rock bottom. The Royal Canadian Mounties made it there before FEMA-what is that? Condeeleza Rice shopping at Salvatore Ferragamo's, Bush blithely flying to luncheons. What a breakdown in society-fiddle while Rome burns why don't you. I feel so awful for the families who were so casually displaced-they will never be the same.

The devastation and heartbreaking events that took place post Katrina were hard to watch but yet I found myself riveted to the screen.  I personally had no idea...none whatsoever...of the evident lack of concern by our government to help the citizens of New Orleans.  Frankly, I am disgusted and embarrassed.  Shoot...Hugo raged through Charleston and only 1 year later the city was restored.  Whaaaaaaat?  Where was that kind of response for New Orleans?  Let me tell you...it just wasn't there.  I think the saddest part of all this is that the storm actually went East and didn't ""hit"" New Orleans...it was the levees breaking that destroyed a once lovely city and it's life-long residents.  Shame on you Army Corp of Engineers, Mr. Bush, FEMA, the insurance companies, etc...you are all to blame and you should be punished for your actions, or should I say lack of actions?

Nothing could be further from the truth.  I am from the New Orleans area, and I cannot count how many white people were just as affected as the blacks.

Lee makes it clear that this was not the natural disaster that the Bush Administration wanted all to believe.  Rather, it was a man made disaster, courtesy of the poorly constructed levees made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the local levee boards. Their inadequate design and construction caused flooding in 80% of New Orleans and all of St. Bernards Parish, way too many deaths, evacuation of much of the population, and major destruction of a great American treasure: New Orleans.

I was just in New Orleans nearly a year ago and a few years before, the city looks like it just got cleared of the debris.  My question is, where did all the money go? Certainly, after eight years, the city should look far better after the storm. The city is full of empty lots, cracked side walks, half renovated buildings. You name it.

2666364,5,B000J10F14,"I use this video in my Meteorology class. That being said, I have the students bring a waiver home that mentions what they are going to see in the video.

First off, the video is amazing. To chronicle such a huge disaster as Hurricane Katrina was is a big task. Clearly, Spike Lee has a bit of an agenda to push (which isn't a huge deal since the Bush administration/FEMA couldn't have done a worse job in handling Katrina), but that doesn't take away from the video at all. The students complete an assignment after the video where they research criticisms about the response from other sources anyway.

Second, the ""characters"" in the video are amazing. Students form bonds with each individual recollection of the events that took place and you just can't forget what these people went through.

Third, the video doesn't take time away from showing you what actually happened. You will see the remnants of the event, dead people included, but the historical value far outweighs the gruesome nature of what you are seeing. Too often we live with blinders on and don't want to see the truth. This video doesn't allow that to happen. That being said, there is only about 5 minutes of that in the four part series.

Lastly, I'd recommend this to anybody looking to gain some insight into Hurricane Katrina. The four part series is easily broken up into a week long activity in my class and the students don't get bored with what they see and this is consistently a high point of the class reviews I receive from my students.

2666386,5,B000J10F14,"When watching documentaries, for the sake of attempting to experience the circumstances of first-hand experience, one must take into consideration the natural and self imposed bias of the author and or the director.  The same may attempt unintentionally and or unfortunately deliberately to imbibe their mentality onto viewers of their well-funded overview of the now considered HISTORY of the event.  I wish for all reading to take this simply formed review of this documentary as how an unbiased reviewer would review this documentary as such:

This documentary, notably, takes very far introspect into neither the media, personal nor biased point of view that related documentaries allows.  In fact, only the first 1/8 of the documentary takes into consideration the near world wide media attention broadcasted pre-emptive and during Hurricane Katrina's landfall.  This documentary, however, focuses on its main subject; '...the land and more importantly its inhabitants.  None of which are to be deemed more valuable nor more valuable to those to any others in these United States of America.""  ""When The Levees Broke"" bleeds the true essence of moral obligation to any citizen of 'these United States of America' and, for that matter, any human being alive in the world as of this date and hopefully into the future.  This takes into consideration any individually assigned grouping or niche that society would allow (race, creed, sexuality, etc.).  If one thinks this is racially driven, BOTH sides of the spectrum are equally criticized and exclaimed for their efforts and downfalls.

In the end this tragedy is of human proportion and cannot be wholly blamed for any body or any group.  This documentary focuses on the failure on all response and, more importantly, the rebuild.

This review is meant to encompass ALL four Acts of ""When The Levees Broke.""",1351987200,,1863,5.235690235690235

2666394,5,B000J10F14,"Spike Lee is a genius period. He gets out of the way and lets people's words and pictures tell the story and does away with any voiceover narration. The DVD set is divided into four acts with a fifth bonus act updating the various survivors' lives.

The basic style is backlit portrait framing of the person speaking and just letting them go. This succeeds because of fantastic editing in piecing together all these disparate people's stories.

It's also great that Lee uses outside news coverage (mainly the BBC's) as well as local and CNN's clips. It gives a far better perspective on how the media covered the story. The images though will be burned into your skull especially of dead bodies just lying (or floating) on streets, freeway interchanges or just sitting in chairs next to the Superdome.

One of the acts mainly focuses on the levees themselves and what wasn't done in years past and what should be done to prevent them breaking again. Hearing engineers talk about the levees and the mistakes the Corps of Engineers made over 40 years (since the previous hurrcane, Betsy, hit NOLA in '65) and how the Netherlands gets it right should put America to shame.

The ""Water is Rising"" on the bonus DVD is just still pics set to a jazz soundtrack but is definitely worth viewing as they have just as strong an impact.

2666404,3,B000J10F14,"This is a wonderful documentary which through interviews and video footage of the catastrophe, helps clarify what happened in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, and presents many questions, many still unanswered, about why it happened.  Viewers will surely be moved by some of the poignant, tragic stories of Katrina's survivors.  Video footage and interviews provide stark evidence of the devastation:  I was particularly touched by the interviews with a woman who, 6 months after Katrina hit, was still camped out in a tent upon a concrete slab, which was all that was left of her house.  She expressed how infuriating it was that the city made her jump through all kinds of hoops to get documentation and ""proof"" that this slab actually belonged to her in the first place.  ""Look at it! There's nothing there!"" She cried, ""Why would I say that was mine if it wasn't!"" One is touched by the common sense that so many government agencies and personalities apparently completely lacked.
While the movie contained many such poignant interviews, it also contained quite a bit of self-righteous preaching which diminished its effectiveness.  Bringing in Al Sharpton, the king of self-righteous finger-pointing, was a mistake. Leave him to his Church of It's All Your Fault and None of Mine.  Several hurricane survivors seemed more interested in pinning the blame on someone, or in articulating their conspiracy theory about why this natural disaster was actually a murder or genocide attempt, and these aspects of the film tended to close my heart rather than open it. The film explored legitimate questions about government failure at many levels, yet other questions were never raised, such as those regarding the wisdom of rebuilding an area that is particularly vulnerable to massive devastation since it lies not only in a Hurricane belt, but also below sea level.  Engineering experts in the film pointed out that Dutch engineers have built levees which are significantly more reliable and sophisticated, but the Netherlands is a country of which some 65% of its land lies below sea level.  By contrast, my guess would be that less than 99.99% of the US lies below sea level, making our overall investment in expensive levees to protect relatively tiny areas perhaps not arguably worth their expense. Personally, I would rather be protected BY Nature, by building my house in a naturally safe area, than rely upon protection AGAINST Nature, by having to trust in structures that are built by humans basically to oppose the forces of Nature.  Nature tends to win.",1289520000,4,2569,5.080760095011876

2666408,5,B000J10F14,"Five years ago, when Hurricane Katrina hit, it really grabbed me.  I was glued to my TV just as much as 9/11.  So when I was reminded of the disaster by mention of its 5th anniversary, I decided to find a book to read that covered the story.  What I found was Spike Lee's ""When the Levees Broke.""  And I'm glad I did.

The four hours of this documentary will place a permanent knot in your stomach.  It's a gut punch that leaves you breathless.  Lee interviews scores of people who tell you their story about how Katrina changed their lives.

What I appreciate most about this program is the depth of personality that you see in the people that are interviewed.  Although you are introduced to maybe 50 different perspectives, each one is unique.  And each one gets deeply personal with you.  You're left feeling like you know them.  They've opened up their biggest hurt and invited you in.  At the end of the documentary, Lee films each person through a picture frame, as the subject states their name, where they're from and their occupation or relationship to New Orleans.  As they pass through the screen one by one, I found myself smiling, or shaking my head, or having some sort of reaction to each one.  That, to me, is the biggest strength of this show - I was really made to feel a small fraction of what each person felt.  Spike Lee introduced me not just to their heartache, but to their very soul.

He did the people of New Orleans a great service. When the Levees Broke isn't easy to watch due of course to the subject matter, but when a story is told so well you take it in and deal with it better than when you're just bombarded with clips on idiotic network news. With an excellent documentary like this the story is made into a human drama you are compelled to watch.

2666412,5,B000J10F14,"How did I want to end the first decade of the 21st Century? Difficult choice. As the ball dropped in Times Square (a few subway stops from my apt) I was sitting at my computer watching this riviting documentary. Again. Katrina and the near destruction of New Orleans was, for me, the most personal tragedy. I know what you're thinking: but she lives in NYC. Wasn't 9/11 the most heartbreaking? No. Because I knew in 1981 when I first went into the WTC lobby this was going to happen. I just didn't know when. Over the yrs. I told all my friends to avoid working there like the plague. I did not lose one single friend that dreadful morning. Spike Lee created a visual memory for future generations to see what hate looks like. Discrimination. The haves versus the have nots and never will haves. I lived in New Orleans in the late 80s in the French Quarter. Knew then this would happen so I cherished every moment I was there. Being an Intuitive, few things are a surprise in my life. Many places I frequented then do not exist. More than a thousand people I passed on the streets do not exist now. The haunting music from 'Inside Man' is a perfect compliment to the scenes of utter destruction and misery. God bless Sean Penn. Why can't there be more like him who can but don't help? This should be shown in every school in the US by the 5th Grade. We cannot afford to have people forget Katrina as the years pass by. The interviews are extensive and unforgetable. I wish he would do a sequel to show us what happened to each one of them and what became of the neighborhoods that were washed away. ""Louisiana. Louisiana. They're trying to wash us away. They're trying to wash us away."" Randy Newman's song about the floods of long ago seque into Katrina like the sun that follows the rain.

My question in this instance is HOW could this have happened in the United States of America??  We can drop food to our enemies within a couple days after an earthquake, etc.  Where were WE????  This Documentary shows the first ""troops"" that showed up were the Mounted Police from Canada!!!  God has nothing to do with what happens AFTER the fact, this is left up to humanity.  After watching this many, many times I have to ask myself what have we lost as human beings. Where are our feelings and compassion? My words may sound harsh as it seems I am speaking against my Country, this is NOT the case.  I love my Country and when I saw this Documentary it broke my heart because it worries me that WE THE PEOPLE are losing the one thing that makes us the greatest Country in the world.

All the blame for the late response was well-deserved to the Bush Administration and all the machinery under it.

If you read books about how all the red-tape of beaurocracy, paranoia, trickle-down theories and turf-wars (which the video doesn't really cover in detail) lead to all the delays, you'll be embarrassed as an American.

2666419,5,B000J10F14,"So many things stand out in this effort and so much can be said.
First, I agree completely with a short moment in the film that talks about mirrors, how we might not like the feeling looking into one. Be jarred by the reality we then might have to face. I know that feeling in my life, it's utterly difficult. Then it goes on to compare this event in Katrina to that, and the subsequent news images, reports to the public dealing with that kind of look in a mirror. But this was also stating it's the look into the mirror just held up to us on and on, as we are locked in the feeling of long term utter dismay at what is really there to be understood. And this film has captured it, and that small observation re-states what this movie does. It holds the mirror to our national behavior in Katrina, to our compassion nationally, our corruption and values, to our reactions and reasons, in this time we call our greatest national disaster, Katrina.
So first, a thank you to those willing to allow invasion into their pain. And to the makers. It's not easy to bear that heat. And it is awesome personal narratives told the story.

Likewise I'd really have vastly preferred to see this in the theater.
Large and inescapable, because of its intensity, I ran out numerous times unable to bear a lot of it. The scenes and the pain for the people are so overwhelmingly playing out- it's difficult to re-live it with them. To look in this film to see what being poor and black sitting on prime real estate in America today gets you by way of disaster response, it just stills my thinking down to utter horror. It's beyond me to try to qualify this national memorial, requiem, impossible to square it with any glimmer of fairness that was buried by this Bush backed leadership. In a time of pain here, today, clearly the predominant issue in American compassion is not determined by anyone's suffering. No, it isn't. Watch.

So within this documentary you look at personal experiences, learn about the aftermath, re-visit obviously good folk dealing with harsh tragedy, see the governmental agencies in play in Katrina, get to even hear a cleaned up Barbara Bush extolling the virtues of shelter life for underpriviledged blacks who are in apparently, in her view, better positions and loving it. ( I'll never ever forget what I saw then as she blithely said to her TV audience that the dispaced in Texas shelters were really liking hotel life as, after all, it was just a good time compared to their real lives. If ever, ever I wanted the defining statement of the attitude I find pernicious beyond belief that would be the you tuby film clip of it) You get to see the experience through time, even hear about weather patterns, the levy's- the works. It's so compelling you listen and watch masterful editing taking you down a river of meaning to arrive at a place where ultimately you are left with the thing New Orleans always embodied anyway, the sheer spirit of a people to endure and find their human dignity, their essence just there.
The art of this documentary is that somehow Lee finds what makes New Orleans something we treasure that is seen, no held,reflected to us,  in her arts, it's the soul I think of that waiting for a day of justice, of freedom, of fairness. Asking the question if we are going to face up to and live our creeds. The artist's role is asking. It is just there in that guy in the film playing the trumpet walking past the piles of collected filth.....playing with the mastery of the artist asking, How could this happen? And what does this say of our greatness, and where exactly does our greatness find expression?

I think the film poses the question to this generation, to my generation.
I don't think any art work poses it better. In it at least for me Mr. Lee cemented his place in a narrow group that I have held up in my consciousness of those willing to hold a mirror to a national audience. I don't think until we deal with what Katrina raised we have any imperative to govern. We may do it, but we don't seem to me to have any clarity about what we do it for. Because we lost ""we the people"" somehow and I don't see anyone noticing really that in the national bus we aren't even putting a segment of our people in the back seats. We are leaving them out on the road and kicking dust in their face. But that's me and it shouldn't get in the way of watching. There is so much to be taken here in personal ways, so much to motivate and understand. It will stand alone for me as a piece. I could write in twenty minutes and say something entirely different as some moment and question raised flashed into memory. It's deep this work. Worth the time.

I'd watch and give this to family, teachers, teens, as graduation present, to groups that want to do work on issues of our times. Screen it with those that might not be paying attention.",1243123200,2,4869,4.447928331466965

2666424,5,B000J10F14,"I've read almost every review, and I'm disappointed to think that so many thought this was in any way racist. Certainly, there were racial situations, and the accompanying anger by those involved, but this riveting and emotional account must be taken objectively. First, this is not about Katrina as much as the breaking of the levees, as the title suggests. The warnings were out there, and those who chose to ignore those warnings were only unfortunate victims. Many had no mobility to go anywhere but the Superdome; it's also made clear that the horrors of the Superdome were more the result of backed up toilets than evil behavior, as reported on the news by angry victims. Indeed, people with infirmities died; put in corners, while the living waited for help that never came. No little kids were raped or murdered. Mr. Lee blamed all the right people: the government at large, lazy FEMA attention, the governor. It also clearly stated the heroism and frustration of the local police and fire-fighters, and the essential efforts of the National Guard. I was disappointed that not enough was said about people stuck in retirement homes and hospitals, the saddest of the ordeal. It also showed Mayor Nagin as a hero, as opposed to the confused pseudo-leader that he is. The recovery of New Orleans after the levee breach is slow, I think due to ambivalent bureaucratic red-tape. Mississippi was hit harder than Louisana by Katrina, and they've almost completely rebuilt. I have a good friend who evacuated her home, and came back to a lot of damage; she went to work as a relief worker, but those who applied for aid were mostly lying about their situations (saying they owned a home, when they only rented, etc.). Lies like that can hold up a recovery effort. Fraud on that level closed the agency for which she worked. I only mention that because her accounts of the ordeal had compelled me to buy this 3-disc DVD set. It's definitely worth watching. I am a white male from Milwaukee, and in my job I helped a few Katrina survivors get housing up here. Calling Spike Lee a racist is as silly as saying that Katrina was orchestrated by the Government to hurt Black people. I've heard both comments; both are absurd. Mr. Lee has presented a clear, horrific expos of things that might have been better, had the government responded properly. Our aid to Sri Lanka after the tsunami was quicker and more complete. ""When the Levees Broke"" should give the viewer an insight to the first-hand situation, and the emotions that result can be of futility, hopelessness or anger, but it definitely creates an emotion. (One reviewer said he laughed; I'm SO sorry for that person). I also appreciated the involvement of Sean Penn; his interviews were among the most insightful.

You look at this piece and kinda think like ""this is America"" and this is how people are treated; like trash or liek refugees in a 3rd world country. The again, you also want to sing a different song; a song of deep hate for America (however, I'm still for the most part proud to be an American).

2666430,5,B000J10F14,"When the Levees Broke - A Requiem in Four Acts documentary is one of the most touching documentaries I have ever seen. I have seen many works by Spike Lee but I do believe this is the best I have seen from him directing. I know many people may think they know what happened during Hurricane Katrina but he takes you on a journey through the lives of the victims and their families. Not only does he ask people that were devastated the most in the Ninth Ward but he also gets the inside scoop from the wealthy people living in the French Quarter. I believe he takes a much unbiased approach at filming this documentary. His main focus is to get the facts out in the open and to make people aware of what was going on when neither FEMA nor the President of our country, George W. Bush, were there to respond in an appropriate fashion. What many people do not know is that they were warned that they levees were not strong enough to hold any kind of weather phenomenon like Katrina long before the hurricane struck the coast. No one was there to listen and to respond to what was really needed by the people.

Spike Lee does a great job with incorporating how Mayor Ray Nagin reacted accordingly to the situation his city was placed in. All of the people interviewed for the documentary made you feel as though you were part of their lives. It is truly remarkable the struggles they had to go through during and after Katrina. It is also astonishing to see how people do not realize this effected New Orleans economy and their faith in our government and why. After watching the documentary I found a brand new respect for New Orleans and their culture. I immediately went down to help in whatever way I possible could even though it has been a few years since the hurricane. There is still plenty of work to be done their but it is home to many many people and I know not to take that for granted.

2666432,1,B000J10F14,"I was born and raised in New Orleans. Though I haven't lived there for over thirty-five years, I maintain close family and personal ties there.

My sister lost her home and her life possessions to Katrina. So did two uncles, four aunts, two cousins and their children, and various in-laws and relatives of in-laws. They were all white and middle-class. So much for Spike Lee's poverty and racism thesis.

My sister and a number of relatives lived in the Lakeview section of New Orleans, which is over 95% white and which Katrina thoroughly inundated. Spike Lee interviewed only one family from Lakeview and they were black. My other relatives lived in St. Bernard Parish, largely populated by whites, on the outskirts of New Orleans. Flash floods there attributed to storm surges up MR GO (Mississippi-River Gulf Outlet) left uncountable scenes of houses swept off there foundations and vehicles overturned or embedded/covered in the remains of unidentifiable debris. Spike Lee showed none of this, but he lingered over similar scenes in the iconic Lower 9th Ward to demonstrate the white man's perfidy toward his black brethren, especially by drawing parallels between levees dynamited by white business cliques in the 1927 flood and rumors of explosions heard along the Industrial Canal next to the Lower 9th Ward during the height of Katrina. Instead, he did not once mention that the black political power structure the city has enjoyed for more than thirty years barely lifted a finger to alleviate the awful plight of the poor black population of New Orleans. The mayor, Ray Nagan, and his cronies got a free pass and the white political establishment received all the blame.

The black majority of New Orleans suffered mightily from Katrina, but so did its white minority, who in Mr Lee's estimation had it too good for too long and didn't warrant sympathy.",1221868800,45,1864,5.006451612903226

2666443,5,B000J10F14,"""When the Levees Broke"" is Spike Lee's eloquent portrayal of the events and personalities of New Orleans who struggled in August 2005 and beyond through the assault and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Lee uses first-person accounts from those who left town early and those who withstood the storm and the difficult recovery period afterwards. Officials and celebrities like Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, controversial New Orleans Policy Chief Eddie Compass and musician Wynton Marsalis are interviewed. But the ordinary people of New Orleans --good, bad and otherwise -- are the heroes of the film, and Lee gives the lion's share of screen time.

Lee subtly addresses some of the myths that have grown up around Katrina. He uses newsroom tape of FEMA head Mike Brown and George Bush to make it clear that government knew how bad the coming storm was. He makes it clear also that all sorts of folks - black and white -- took the initiative to get out of town before the storm hit. And he tries to explain why so many, including those with few means -- the poor, elderly and sick of all colors - stayed behind to fend for themselves. Many who stayed were unable to leave due to illness of incapacity. Others seemed deeply conflicted about evacuating - choosing to remain close to home, a home often purchased at great cost in money and time.

Lee lets residents be themselves, even when they make mistakes. He shows them airing ridiculous-sounding rumors, like the claim that the enormous explosions heard during the storm were from the levees being deliberately blown up. But Lee respects the residents enough Lee gives context to this fear, citing an earlier occasion when levees *were* dynamited. Lee documents nave residents flocking to the Superdome, believing that help was on its way, and assuming that government aid would soon arrive, as it did during 9/11 and other national emergencies. But the anguish of the residents is in plain sight. Shots of elderly residents brought back to view wrecked homes - the results of a lifetime of labor and love - are heartbreaking.

The film shows Nagin and Blanco in far better light than they are normally shown. The Bush administration does not come off as well, and no federal officials were interviewed for the film, a serious shortcoming if intentional. Nagin, Blanco and others were nowhere near perfect in their reaction to the storm, but a legitimate question is whether the feds tried to cover their sins by spreading the blame down the chain of command.

The film's first two discs comprise Acts I-IV, the main part of the film, describing the approach of the storm, its fury, the immediate aftermath and the dispersal of New Orleans' citizens across the nation. Disc 3 contains additional material focusing in the efforts Sean Penn, author Douglas Brinkley and others to rescue New Orleans residents. This disk spotlights the disorganization and incompetence that surrounded the post-Katrina response. The role of police seemed to have become preventing people from fleeing the city and using the stocks of police boats needed to rescue friends and family. Hearing first-hand tales of rescuers -- of residents trapped in their attics, of the non-involvement of police, of the complete absence of Red Cross or FEMA in the first days of the disaster, of insurers returning pittances for destroyed homes-- was harrowing and inexplicable. In the absence of explanations, no wonder people have thought the worst - that class, color and greed were driving the official response.

Lee's film is a master work of the documentary form. Using images, mournful music and first-hand testimony, he builds an edifice of truth-telling that is far grander than the individual timbers that went into its construction. His pastiche of the faces, voices and emotions of New Orleanians most eloquently raises questions about the proper role of government. Is government a means of enriching oneself and one's friends, of satisfying one's personal ambitions or of flattering one's ego? Or is it, as some old document says, is instituted to ""establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity""? Whatever your answer, Lee's film shows government falling down in a big way when Katrina came storming into the Gulf in 2005. By showing us the results of government gone wrong, abetted by unaddressed poverty, hopelessness, dependence and racism, and assisted by official neglect, accidents and incompetence.

Lee raises many questions and answers few. He does not (perhaps could not) interview everyone who might have shed light on his subject. He may even try too hard to prove a racist intent for the horrible things that went wrong in New Orleans. But the devastation he filmed - not just of buildings and possessions but of spirit, pride and hope - ought to haunt the viewer long after the end credits finish rolling. Lee does his best to end his work on a positive note. This sometimes seems like painting a happy smile on a corpse. Yet he wants to be hopeful, as hopeful as the people of New Orleans are themselves about the future. ""When the Levees Broke"" at the very least is a record on a personal level of what it was like to live through Hurricane Katrina. At best it is a clarion call to hold government accountable for the welfare of its citizens, regardless of color, class or cash flow.",1207353600,,5480,4.970556161395856

So much of New Orleans remains destroyed 2.5 years later.  Anything that is done for the poor is done by nonprofit organization and volunteers.  There is no federal or state aid available as real and immediate assistance. The politics is disgraceful and the film certainly brings that out.

2666451,5,B000J10F14,"I have to admit I was never a big Spike Lee fan before I saw When The Levees Broke.  I was in New Orleans before, during, and after Katrina.  I was one of the lucky ones that was on ""higher ground"" during the 4 days of hell I was trapped in the city.  Four days with no water, electricity, 100 degree heat, complete darkness at night (all you heard were helicopters and occasional gunshots), and fear for my safety (I was a single woman alone in my apartment).  Luckily, I lived above a grocery store that was broken into, or I wouldn't have had food either.  In those 4 days, I didn't see one police officer, one rescue worker, or any kind of help.  I finally left the city with neighbors, fearing that I would not get out because a neighbor the day before (a middle class white woman) was turned back at gunpoint when she and her husband tried to drive over the bridge that was the only way out of this city.  We made it to Houston, and I managed to get a flight out, not knowing if I'd ever see ""my city"" again.  Six weeks later, I returned, only to find myself illegally evicted by landlord and ALL of my possessions gone.
  On the year anniversary of Katrina, my boyfriend and I decided to watch ""When the Levees Broke"".  I sat there, completely entranced as I saw the news footage and all the devastation and horrible things that were happening around me.  I still can't believe how little help New Orleans received.  Two and a half years later, this city is STILL affected.  You see it everywhere--streets full of houses with ""For Sale"" signs out front, people still living in FEMA trailers, people missing family members that left after Katrina and never came back.  There is a fog of depression that still hangs over New Orleans and it's not the same city it was before Katrina.  A lot of locals think the country has forgotten about us.
  I commend Spike Lee (as well as Brad Pitt and Sean Penn) for showing the world that New Orleans still needs help and Katrina should not be forgotten.  It's people like that who give me and others here hope.
  We have made it an annual tradition in our house to watch ""When The Levees Broke"" every year on August 29th.  I look forward to the day when those memories are blurry and distant, and New Orleans is the happy, exciting, fun, laid-back city it once was and hopefully can be again.

You will not believe your eyes nor will you believe how the American government and the state governments impacted the healing process.  Peoples lives were lost and you won't help but sympathize with every person who suffered at the hands of the Hurricane and the breach of the levee.

I looked through quite a few documentaries on Katrina. Spike Lee's ""When the Levees Broke"" had a profound effect on me. It was the only one I recommended to the band director for reviewing with the band. Spike Lee talked to real people that let you understand what horrors they went through. The whole piece just felt real, not produced. I have long been an admirer of Spike Lee's work and this is a solid addition to his collection of films.

It seemed that the bulk of the help came from private individuals who risked their finances, and in some cases their lives, to help where they could.

Everyone was left to fend for himself or herself, since 'government' at all levels failed these people, mostly due to incompetence. The failure was (and still is) devastating.

Luckily, I was able to evacuate to a relative's house in Baton Rouge (about 75 miles west of N.O.), so my family and I were spared the immediate aftermath and the horrific conditions experienced by those who were unable to get out of the city.

Through this film, however, I was able to feel the pain and loss of my neighbors and friends. It was very difficult for me to watch and I broke down and cried several times. New Orleans is my home and will ALWAYS be my home. No matter where I go or end up living (I have relocated and now live about 30 west of N.O.), New Orleans will forever be a part of my soul. If you are not from there, you probably wouldn't understand. It was so damn difficult to see familiar places and people undergoing such a tragedy.

A piece of my heart died on August 29th, 2005 and another piece died when I watched this film, but I HAD to see it. It is important for eveyone to see this film because it raises many questions that have yet to be answered. How can such brutal and barbaric conditions be allowed to continue for so long in one of the richest countries in the world? Why did it take so long to get help? Why was the city so unprepared for such a catastrophe? Why have the problems NOT been solved 2 years after the event?

I still don't know any of the answers.

All I know is that I must own this film. I must have it to show my children one day (my daughter was 2 at the time the storm hit and my 2nd child is on the way) so that they never forget where we came from and the many mistakes our generation made when trying to deal with this crisis. Hopefully, others will show this to their children as well so that they can learn from these mistakes and make sure that something like this never happens again.

The ONLY pet peeve I have with the film (it's a small one) is that it seems to take the point of view of the black, underprivileged portion of the city's population. Yes, these were the majority of those that suffered in the aftermath, but Katrina affected EVERYONE in this region. I felt that the objectivity of the film should have been a bit more balanced.

As for the reviewer who thought this film was funny, I wish you peace and hope that one day your heart will be softened and you will learn to have compassion for your fellow man.

2666469,5,B000J10F14,"Spike Lee's monumental six hour WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE is an enthralling account of the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, which left much of New Orleans under water in late August 2005.  Called a Requiem in Four Acts (plus a 105 minute Epilogue), the HBO miniseries is a heartbreaking and angry blend of documentary footage of the flood damage, attack on the federal government for not being in New Orleans in timely fashion, and oral history by proud survivors.

Each act is about an hour long.  Act One begins with the hurricane starting on August 28, 2005.  I played this hour with Mr. Lee's audio commentary, which seems to blame the federal government in general and President George Bush specifically for not being in New Orleans.  ""He didn't give a [damn],"" replies Spike.  We get information on two previous Gulf States hurricanes, one in 1927 and Betsy in 1965.  Mr. Lee shows CNN and BBC footage of newspeople and the flood damage, then asks where our own federal government and FEMA were.  A black male mayor and a white woman governor hate each other's guts as people die.  Sean Penn is one of the heroes of this miniseries, helping rescue dozens of people from filthy water.  Spike again (and his commentary is very heavy-handed and angry) wants to know why Bush and no one in his cabinet showed up in New Orleans for a full week?  According to Mr. Lee, the Canadian Mounties came down from Vancouver quicker than Bush and company did.  When Spike stops talking and ranting against our government, his survivors have powerful and sad tales to tell of fleeing the devastation, then trying to get back to their homes, as we watch the flood devastation.  The hour ends with evacuees in the hot and smelly Super Dome.

Act Two has evacuees still in the Super Dome or the Convention Center with no food or water or toilets.  The National Guard arrives and threatens to shoot innocent Americans trying to get back to their home ruins.  The mayor of New Orleans is ineffectual, and the pit bull governor supports the National Guard.  Spike Lee shakes his head aurally on the audio commentary:  ""Even in the 21st Century, even in America, this is still happening.""  There is brilliant helicopter footage of the devastation, but it is from the BBC, not our own government.  Mr. Lee proves with documentary footage that George Bush knew from the Weather Service of a probable hurricane about to hit New Orleans a day after August 27th, but it took him TWELVE DAYS to get down to the flood site.  ""He just didn't give a [damn],"" comments Spike again.  He then adds that if the federal government really did not know what was going on or what to do, maybe they were not qualified to hold their jobs.  The National Guard again tried to kill looters and other flood victims, until the Army showed up:  ""Put those guns down. These are American citizens.""  Act Two ends with a montage of dead bodies.

I played Acts Three and Four without Spike Lee's unnecessary commentary relentlessly attacking the federal government.  The miniseries plays much more effectively with the flood survivors themselves asking where the federal government, particularly FEMA, was.  People are migrating to Arkansas, Texas, and Tennessee, but especially Houston, Texas.  150,000 people there were homeless and jobless.  Vice President Cheney comes down to New Orleans and is told to go [hang] himself; it takes two full weeks for Bush to get on national TV.  Worst of all is Barbara Bush in a Houston homeless shelter; she insensitively suggests that maybe the survivors are better off now than in poverty level New Orleans.  She hangs herself verbally with no assistance from Spike Lee.  He lets survivors eloquently tell their own stories:  ""We aren't refugees, we are American citizens.""  FEMA is a national joke and disgrace.  The people are helping themselves without federal government help, so maybe FEMA and other government agencies should be abolished, survivors suggest.  As a black woman revisits the ruins of a house she has lived in all her life, there is the theme of rebuilding New Orleans ""because it is our home and where everything we love is.""  Two of those things are music and cultural rituals.  A psychiatrist speaks about an increase in suicides and suicidal thoughts among his patients.  A woman holds up a photo of a five year old girl.  Her sad funeral ends Act Three of WHEN THE LEVEES RISE.

I also played Act Four without Spike Lee's unnecessary and shrill commentary.  We open with music--a band and Mardi Gras, the spirit to celebrate is still in New Orleans.  Three or four months are going by, and the survivors complain that the federal government is just sitting on their thumbs.  A student learns his mom died in a house that was not searched, and the body was not buried for two months.  Survivors want to know repeatedly why we can fight a war in Iraq, but not give water or power to our own country.  Trailers sit empty in a trailer yard, waiting months for the federal government to give them to homeless people.  Worst of all are insurance companies that people have been paying premiums to for years.  They argue with survivors--benefits for hurricanes, but none for flooding, and this is flooding.  Nasty real estate companies want to buy up the land and bulldoze the ruined homes that owners want to rebuild.  The Army Corps of Engineers arrives, but isn't sure what to do.  Survivors say to look at what The Netherlands did to prevent a similar flooding.  Act 4 ends with sunset over the Mississippi River, then ten minutes of portraits of people alphabetically as a sort of people cast list.  ""Walking Through New Orleans"" plays on the soundtrack.  Terence Blanchard did the haunting trumpet and piano score for the whole movie.  The film editors are Geeta Ghanbhir and Nancy Novack, supervised by Sam Pollard.  They did a mammoth and magnificent job of combining oral history and documentary footage.  WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE may be Spike Lee's crowning achievement, though he is too quick to blame the federal government for everything bad; I'd love to hear what Bush and Cheney have to say.

For DVD, Mr. Lee has added a 105 minute Act 5 Epilogue.  It is mostly oral history (blessedly without audio commentary) of where everyone was on August 28, 2005 and what they did in the days that followed this terrible New Orleans flood.  They range from actor Sean Penn (a real hero) to pastors and authors, lawyers and students, engineers and a medical examiner.  They are all backed by Terence Blanchard's trumpet and piano music score.  There was rampant police brutality, especially white against black, in the days that followed.  Penn talks powerfully of rescuing dozens of people in muddy water because the federal government had not shown up yet.  If FEMA could not figure out how to mobilize, the survivors rationalize, then maybe we don't need FEMA.  That's a sobering thought, the federal government saying that maybe the survivors are better off without our interference.  An engineer tries to explain what happened, why, and how to try and prevent it again in the future.  We hear from a chef, a doctor, and musicians.  A white trial lawyer sends out 7,000 claims to people he is trying to help, only to realize that a sizeable number of the people cannot read.  And through it all, FEMA is an ineffectual joke.  The city will survive and rebuild without federal government help.  Fade out on a rapper at the gate to a cemetery.

I did not play it, but this enthralling 3-disk DVD of Spike Lee's WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE also features something called WATER IS RISING.  It is described as blending a gallery of photos with music by Terence Blanchard.  I commend this magnificent HBO miniseries to your rental and sales attention.  It will take you three nights, but is well worth that much time.",1179619200,3,7822,4.78134328358209
2666470,5,B000J10F14,"Spike Lee is a hugely talented and culturally significant filmmaker. He has a global reputation. His name, like  Woody Allen, guarantees his output will find an audience. He is about as secure in terms of artistic reputation as you could ever expect anyone to be - especially in the fickle world of film. So why did he leave the relative safety of fiction films to tackle, very soon after the event, a four hour documentary on the US State response to Hurricane Katrina?

Nothing is harder to reflect on film than our recent and media-saturated past.

Spike Lee, however, handles this emotive and complex subject with great skill. He relies almost completely on 'talking heads', letting those who experienced the gulf coast disaster speak with an eloquence that belies their grief. The images are shocking. Dead body after dead body, juxtaposed with smiling politicians and waffling beaureaucrats. But it is the words of the survivors that bite.

This is must-see documentary filmmaking at its very best. And should be compulsory study in schools, especially for those who believe we in the so-called civilised 'West' have the best system of support and help for the needy! The slow response of FEMA is truly scandalous.

2666471,5,B000J10F14,"9/11 was terrifying.  For the first time in decades, we were attacked on our own soil.  But the assault came from outsiders.  Even more frightening is to think there may be a malevolent group within the country that kills people by its own negligence.

Prior to watching Spike Lee's masterpiece, I had navely thought that New Orleans was wiped out by Hurricane Katrina.  In fact, Lee argues that the United States Army Corps of Engineers designed the levees so poorly that they could not withstand anything stronger than a category two hurricane.  Given the fact that the city is surrounded by water on all sides, it was inevitable that it would be hit by a storm much more powerful than category two, thus, the engineers-- who can't be sued -- bear an enormous amount of responsibility for the catastrophe that befell hundreds of thousands of people.

Worse was the downright embarrassing and disgraceful response of the Bush administration.  It took George Bush 12 days to get down to New Orleans.  Meanwhile, he was on vacation and making speeches about Iraq (hey, let's get our priorities straight!)  while Dick Cheney was flyfishing and Condoleezza Rice was buying shoes.  Spike Lee shows some old footage of Lyndon B. Johnson making a clumsy appearance in New Orleans following Hurricane Betsy -- old LBJ was out there in the dark with his flashlight and down-homey kind of way but at least he was there.  People knew that he cared.  FEMA, as we all know, took five days to get to the city although somehow it only took our government two days to go across the world to help the tsunami victims.  One can only conclude that it is deliberate disdain and racism or a complete lack of concern for people of lower incomes that resulted in such a horrifically slow and inadequate response to this tragedy.

Spike Lee, who I've always loved, tells the story of Katrina through the words of those who lived through it -- from rich to poor, black to white, the important to the ""ordinary.""  Their tales moved me to tears and to an angry rage as the story unfolded from the beginning of the chaos to the cleanup -- or so-called -- and the bailouts of so many insurance companies who refused to pay up.

One thing that I would have appreciated in this HBO series was a few more facts.  After watching for four hours, I still don't know exactly how many people were killed or injured.  Also, there was a reference early on to the fact that the levees had been dynamited during Betsy and that some people suspected that the same may have happened during Katrina in order to flood out the homes of the poorest people to save the rich.  That's a serious allegation and it deserved more time and attention in the film.

Otherwise, this DVD was fantastic.  It was moving and irreverent -- a real eye-opener and must-see.  Hope that it's resurrected before the next election!

2666472,4,B000J10F14,"I have been a big fan of Spike Lee's work for years even though most of my friends have never understood why, or at least claimed not to. I liked this a lot, but I have several issues with it that keep me from giving it 5 stars.

Since there are already so many well-written reviews on the good points of this film, I will cut to the chase and just detail the issues I have with it.

1. This is not a documentary in the strictest sense. I wish they would come up with a new word for films like this and the films of people like Michael Moore. Incidentally, I really enjoy these films but the journalist inside me forces me to maintain the fact that these are not documentaries in the true sense of the word. There is a great deal of documentation that goes on in this film, but it is mostly pointed in one direction in accordance with the truth as the filmmaker sees it. Again, even though I happen to agree with most of it, I still feel obligated to point this out. the eidting and the framing of shots in several cases were deliberately done to accentuate the POV of the director, not to mention many of the interviews. Lee did not document katrina's aftermath; he decided what he thought about Katrina and then found footage and conducted interviews in line with his existing thesis. He documented his opinion, which may or may not be in line with the truth. In some cases it was, in some cases it obviously was not.

2. The conspiracy theory stuff should have been left out. it was so outrageous that it was distracting. I am referring to the claims that the levees were dynamited in 2005 in order to flood the poor black neighborhoods to save the rich white ones. This is so hyperbolic it is almost insulting.

3. The slavery metaphors were also hyperbolic, and should have been left out. Katrina's aftermath was many things, but it has nothing to do with slavery other than the fact that they both involved black people and both took place in the south.

4. This last point dovetails with point number 1. In 4 hours, with most of the 4 hours being interviews, he did not offer a single interview that was dissenting from his pre-planned POV. His POV is the following: poor people and/or black people are allowed to stay vulnerable by the powers that be. When a disaster occurs that is made far worse by the existing vulnerabilities, the government makes a concerted effort not to help the victims because they are poor and black. Reasons advanced for this are racism and lack of political or economic power. Not a single interview was shown that offered a dissenting opinion from this POV. Not one. I happen to think that the reasons shown are mostly true, but not 100% of the story a long shot. Somewhere between 50 and 80% of the story, sure. Where is the other part of the story? it isn't here. Lee seems to be convinved that there are no other explantions, and he is unwilling to let us listen to anyone who might.

Furthermore, there are no interviews shown in which anyone dissents from the opinion that when disaster happens, it is the sole 100% responsibility of the government (state or federal) to fix everything and take care of everything for the victims. I believe they certainly have a role, but there seems to be an opinion of many of the victims--and Mr. Lee--that the government is solely responsible for every aspect. There was not one mention of any personal responsibility on the part of the victims. Not one sentence. I personally have a problem with this attitude. I do not live my life based on the assumption or the belief that the government is going to be held 100% responsible for my well-being in case of disaster striking. In fact, just the opposite maybe. this film seems to suggest that the government is--and should be--100% responsible for the well-being of it's citizenry. There is 0% responsibility to be laid on the backs of the victims. I'm sorry, but I fundamentally disagree with this position, and I think a person holds this position at their own peril. I'm not asking Mr. Lee or anyone else to agree with this; I just wish he included at least a 30 second interview with someone who did.

Again, I liked the film a lot and there are many things I liked about it, but I feel like all of those sentiments have already been expressed here in detail so I left them out of my particular review. Thanks for your time.",1178668800,18,4359,4.46859296482412

2666475,4,B000J10F14,"Say what you will about Spike Lee, but he does not buy the government spin and for that reason he stands out as a voice of reason in our nation of sheep. Here he documents, over four acts, the Hurricane Katrina debacle through the eyes of one very ticked off black man. The first two acts basically retell the story of the lead up to the hurricane and its path of destruction. Act III, the weakest of the bunch, kind of blathers on about how great the music of New Orleans is and how terrible the devastation is. The final act is something of an enjoyable diversion as Lee seems to go after any pet peeve of his that he can connect to Katrina: insurance companies, global warming, government corruption. The thing that amazed me is how it really was no different than those color by numbers, dry as dust ones that PBS puts out on a weekly basis, and yet this one, powered by anger, outrage and audacity never slows down and schools the viewer on all aspects of the travesty. This is something of an amazing feat and the only thing that prevents it from being a great film is that it is a tad overstuffed.

Whether you are conspiracy minded or not (I am as is this film) there is plenty here to shock even the most casual viewer, and that itself seems to be the main point. Even if you weren't directly affected by Katrina any person with a brain can recognize this as a prime example of the US government crapping all over their citizens in the name of callousness and greed. Lee goes so far as to imply that the levees were bombed in an attempt to chase the black people out of the 9th Ward so that the white developers could move in and make barrels of gold off of other people's land. It all made sense to me and if you don't see it then I might suggest that perhaps you watch too much Fox News. And let us not forget the clips of the armed troops keeping the displaced blacks out of the white neighborhoods at gunpoint. Or the cops looting the Wal-Mart for DVDs. Or George W. Bush, waste of blood that he is, grandstanding on the outskirts of the city politicking for his Imperial Grand Strategy. Funny how every time a national disaster happens on this man's watch the person that benefits the most is George W. Bush.

I will admit that Lee does have an overly strong inclination to go to bat for the home team. Ray Nagin looks outstanding here and yet New Orleans looks like a pit. Can these two things truly exist completely independently of one another? I also could have lived without the slave rhetoric. But I also think that we need to admit that this tragedy exposed racial problems in our country. In no way do I walk around looking for examples of racism, we have come very far since the Civil Rights Movement, but when things like this occur and racism stares us in the face we need to own up to it. I will be very interested to see if Louisiana remains red in the next election. No other state was as directly affected by Republican ineptitude as they were, but will it be enough to bring them over to the blue team? ***3/4",1177718400,22,3039,4.301919720767888
2666476,5,B000J10F14,"As a resident of south Mississippi, I am incredibly frustrated by media that reports ""Hurricane Katrina Struck New Orleans.""  In truth, Hurricane Katrina struck the Mississippi gulf coast and south Louisiana, visiting upon those areas a thirty foot wall of water.  New Orleans, on the edge of the weaker northwest quadrant of the storm, was merely brushed.

It is a point which WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE brings out early: New Orleans received at best a glancing blow and it should have survived.  The great disaster which befell the city was not so much natural as man-made.  And throughout the documentary's four hour run time, director Spike Lee not only presents a kalidescope of interviews with survivors, he repeatedly returns to the inevitable question: how did it happen?

Much of the answer to that question depends on who you ask.  New Orleans has a history of blowing levees, and early in the film several people state flatly that the levees were deliberately blown in an effort to protect the city's weathier districts at the expense of poorer areas.  But although director Lee gives the idea play, it soon becomes clear that no such effort was required: it was in fact a mixture of bad design; neglect; an unwillingness by city, state, and federal officials to spend the money; and, most simply, indifference toward the people of New Orleans and indeed Louisiana in general.

WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE is truly devastating in its portrait of a great American city's collapse.  Interviews with survivors, achieval footage, and news reports paint a damning portrait of failure at almost every possible level.  Most damning is the picture of federal inaction.  While people drowned in their attics, President Bush was on vacation.  While people collapsed from heat prostration and dehydration Condoleeza Rice bought shoes at an upscale store.  The minutes became hours, the hours became days, and the cavalry simply did not arrive.

Spike Lee is a somewhat problematic director, an artist who has the very distinct tendency to interject race issues into scenarios whether such is warranted or not.  In this particular instance, however, I believe Lee is on target when the attributes federal inaction in large part to the fact that New Orleans is predominately poor and black.  Had he gone further to note the obvious fact that the city is also of the deep South--a region that has typically been ignored by Washington--he would have struck a bull's eye; it is worth pointing out that south Mississippi, which is predominately white, experienced the same federal foot dragging and ridiculous mismanagement.

When all is said and done, WHEN THE LEVEES broke is a stunning but flawed portrait of a horrific disaster that befell a great American city--a city which, as of this date, has yet to begin a significant recovery and which will very likely never again be the New Orleans of legend and song.  It's great strength is that it allows the victims to speak for themselves; it's great failure is a tendency to posit race plain and simple as the cause of federal indifference.  It was a mighty factor, to be sure, but nothing is ever quite as simple as all that.

The DVD release includes three disks.  The film itself offers a commentary by Lee; the third disk consists of bonus material that further elaborates what is indeed an American tragedy.  In spite of occasional flaws, I recommend it very strongly.

2666477,5,B000J10F14,"Near the end of Spike Lee's four hour documentary, the jazz trumpter, Wynton Marsalis states something to the effect that this is a signature moment in American history when a mirror is being held up and if you look at the reflection, you might not like what you see. Beyond the story of the devastating tragedy suffered by the people of New Orleans, this film holds a mirror up to a nation where during a moment of crisis the government's responsibility to its people seemed an afterthought at best. I spent eight hours with this film during the week I watched it. First I watched it as it was originally shown and then again with Spike Lee's stirring director's commentary. This is an angry film and Lee does not hold back in his condemnation of the many people responsible for the disaster or their response to it. Lee emphasizes that the disaster did not occur because of Katrina but because of the levees being ill-equipped to handle a hurricane of Katrina's magnitude. People's lives were destroyed because of human error and those responsible held themselves above reparation.

This is a film that provokes feelings of sadness and anger. It's filled with images that are absolutely haunting. Yet, as Lee points out at the end of his commentary, ""When the Levees Broke"" is ultimately a document of the human spirit, maybe even a hopeful film. Despite the incredible adversity the survivors of Katrina have faced, the film shows how many of them have endured.

2666482,5,B000J10F14,"Phyllis Montana LeBlanc for President!  Or, at least Secretary of Keeping It Real.  Ms. LeBlanc, a passionate and articulate victim of the 2005 New Orleans flood, is one of many Big Easy residents who appears in the Spike Lee mega-documentary film WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE.  Her commentary proves to be one of many unforgettable aspects of this must-see work.

Of course, by calling New Orleans residents victims of the August 2005 floodwaters, I oversimplify.  As WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE documents, for forty years responsible powers knew the New Orleans levees could not withstand the pressure of a hurricane such as Katrina but did nothing.  The Bush administration and F.E.M.A., who knew what was going to happen days in advance of the hurricane, did nothing.  And when the storm subsided and people needed rescue, food, and water, the Bush gang and F.E.M.A. dragged their feet, allowing preventable death and misery for several days before acting.

WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE cuts no corners telling its story.  About the only lowlight of those tragic summer 2005 days it misses is Laura Bush's telling comment, where she referred to the storm as ""Hurricane Corrina"" at least twice in the same interview.

While the illegal, immoral war in Iraq got most of the credit for the fall of the Republicans in the 2006 elections, the federal government's willful disregard for New Orleans had to be on voters' minds, too.  As I write this in March 2007, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco has announced she will not seek re-election because of low poll numbers, so it seems the people are repaying Republican Lite Democrats such as Ms. Blanco, too.  WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE closes with the Fats Domino song, ""Walking To New Orleans.""  Another Fats Domino song, ""So Long,"" speaks to the responsible public office holders who knew what could happen but turned a blind eye.  May they get theirs.

2666491,4,B000J10F14,"Let me start this by saying that I am a Katrina survivor. I spent several weeks away from home and would never consider myself a refugee as the media and government would probably labeled me. My home was and is two miles or so from the 17th Street Canal breach.

Spike Lee and Sam Pollard have crafted the finest type of documentary. The story is an oral history by the people involved with very little interjection of opinion by the filmakers. Lee manages to let the people tell their own stories, to voice their views, to laugh, cry and heal. A rather large segment of the New Orleans population is included. Lee's opinion that this was not just a race tragedy but one of class also is well presented.

We get an overall dim view of the state, local, and national government in the days immediately preceding and following the passage of the hurricane. The key point is that suffering and death that resulted was not caused by Katrina but by the human error that was the building of the levee system that was designed to protect the city and its surroundings. Another strong point that Lee makes was the sense of abandonment that the citizens of the area felt in the days following the storm. How is it conceivable in America that it would take the government five days to get to the site.

The series is presented on three discs with the four hour feature occupying the first two discs. Lee provides a very insightful commentary on the feature which is easily equal to the material presented. He gives his thoughts on the disaster and provides information on the creation of the film (how it came together).

The bonus materials are also quite relevant. An epilogue entitled Next Movement runs about 105 minutes and provides more interviews on the rebuilding process. Water is Rising is a photo montage with the music of Terance Blanchard. Both of these features are well worth seeing.

Lee says that he would like to continue to follow this story into the future as Michael Apted did on his UP Series. Lets hope he gets the chance.",1172793600,7,2035,4.595041322314049

We had an opportunity to go through the lower 9th ward, which is still a ghost town.  In the background right now I'm listening to myself narrate as I'm filming the footage that I'd taken in the lower 9th ward.  I hear myself saying ""Oh my God"" and ""Unbelievable"" frequently, and that is only because I was at a loss for words to describe what I was seeing and feeling.

I am a student of U.S History and politics here in England and have always been interested in the corruption of America. This amazing DVD shows that race relations have not really changed too much since the institutionalised southern racism of the 1960's. The DVD gives an emotional and moving detailed discussion and explanation of the twin tragedies of the hurricane and the pathetically inept Government and local response to the devastation. The DVD is not narrated, but instead the survivors, local officials and engineering/meterological experts tell their stories and explain exactly what went wrong, what happened and why, in their own series of interviews. Added with rare and powerfully emotional footage, still photographs with excellent editing and haunting music, it makes for a truly moving 4 hours, that never once gets boring or repetitive. How often can you say that about a 4 hour film?

 I remember the reports on TV over Katrina here in the U.K and how we were told about the rioting and looting day after day, how it was too dangerous to help the citizens of new orleans because there was so much gunfire and death in the city. It was all propaganda and total LIES LIES LIES. To see this makes you realise that this disinformation was designed for the media to sell Bush's story and cover the fact that the Government did virtually nothing to relieve starving, suffering, bereaved, sick and thirsty people who had literally lost everything but their lives. It's a disgusting way for the richest nation on earth to treat its own citizens and it makes me sick that this could have happened in the 21st century in the United States. Race and class still divide the nation, that's all glaringly obvious in the unbelievable stories on this film.
 I invite anyone who votes for Bush and Cheney to watch this film and think about what this man has done to damage your nation that brave men like Robert Kennedy, King, Malcolm X etc had to lose their lives to achieve,  equality for African America.",1170547200,6,2074,4.8011204481792715

2666500,5,B000J10F14,"I've heard this criticism of Spike before this and I have never understood where it has come from. I guess if you spend your life and career documenting lives and creating stories about people that society has left behind, and if a large portion of those depicted have been black, I guess you get called a ""racist!"" Spike does see racism everywhere but let me ask you this: what black man of his age, who grew up where he grew up, doesn't have some of those tinges simply from being burned by the system? Every writer pours some of himself into everything he does, fictional or not.

I watched Hurricane Katrina and the various reports on CNN and other news outlets with a dull horror thinking about a National Geographic doc I had seen in 97 or 98 about hurricanes and tornados. They predicted, especially a through a chilling and prophetic artist's conception, exactly what happened in New Orleans in 05. An weather offical (I can't remember his offical post) said the levee's were a ""two edged sword."" If the water ever went over them, the water would get as deep as the levee's are tall. That's exactly what happened. As Spike points out in his excellent commentary that's like, as the best commentaries are, having a second movie included, that's what caused the destruction. Hurricane Katrina side-swiped New Orleans.

Through stunning interviews with most of the prinicipals involved with this tragedy, from Mayor Nagin and Governor Blanco to Shelton ""Shakespeare"" Alexander and Wynton Marsalis, he cuts to the main human tragedy at the heart of the story. There are more black people in this doc than white people but hey, that's the majority of the people that got screwed by their government, from all sources except for the Coast Guard. There's enough historical information to answer questions and it's long enough (FOUR HOURS!) to give enough time to everybody to say their peace.

My favorite moments include Soledad O'Brien's ""interorgation"" of Michael Brown that shows what happens when reporters have the guts to ask tough questions and see through the lies and the avoidance that politicians always do when their backed into a corner by the truth. The analysis of the levee's and the warnings that were basically ignored by President Bush the day before the storm.

Spike's commentary is funny as well as insightful to his filmaking process. He proved to me that he wasn't racist when he says things like, ""George Bush doesn't care about poor white people either."" over footage of two white women talking in front of one of there torn down houses. He praises the two white guys who told Dick Cheney to go **** himself in Misissippi as well as the white lady who told Condie Rice ""How dare you!"" while she was shopping for shoes the day after the storm.

This documentary does what all good documentaries do. They answer questions while raising more while at the same time raising your awareness above and beyond where it was before.

Bravo Spike!!

I was excited to see it on a DVD shelf at Target and quickly bought it.  I started watching it the same evening and found myself completely absorbed in the heartbreaking and shameful story of Hurricane Katrina.  During Act II of the film I found myself wondering if I should continue watching because the anger I remember feeling as the actual event unfolded on television was rekindled in a very unsettling way.  I once again felt ashamed of this country and its deeply entrenched denial of race as a baromenter of qualification for basic human dignity and respect.  I think the terrible response of the government to Katrina was all about race and class (there were, after all, some poor whites who suffered as well).  I have only two questions, ""How is it after Katrina and Iraq that even 39% of the American people still believe in Bush?  What more evidence does a nation need that its leader is a bumbling fool (and a dangerous one at that)?""

He has again (wisely) resisted the temptation to articulate any personal feelings about the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and has instead allowed the story to be told by those who were there and lived through it, mixed in with an archive of compelling news footage. It's more than four hours long but I didn't even notice. The time just flew by.

There are many diverse views on Katrina, especially on how it pertains to the mostly African American citizens of New Orleans. Was this purely about race or about a general disdain for the poor? Was it a natural disaster of proportions no one was really prepared for or evidence of massive human and governmental failure? Whatever your views, unless you were actually there, (with all the ensuing political wrangling and pursuit of disparate agendas), I doubt you got the whole story. This requiem in four acts gives you the whole story. I say watch it and make up your own mind.

2666508,5,B000J10F14,"Spike Lee is a versatile director, but seems to be at his best when making documentaries. When the Levees Broke is a masterpiece of a documentary. Lee is able to capture the raw emotion of the people who lived through Katrina in a way that is honest and pure. There are quite a few comments that many film editors would have cut out, but Lee left them in. He lets the people speak for themselves without feeling like they need to engage in self censorship.

The Katrina tragedy has so many stories and nuances to it that it would be impossible to cover everything. It would take many more hours to cover everything. Lee does a good job of covering the story from beginning to the aftermath. He weaves in a lot of stuff and even gives some nice historical and cultural context to the situation.

I was expecting this film to be more politically charged than it is. Yes, the people voice their opinions about the government's response, but in the end Lee makes this a film about the people who survived Katrina. People can make up their own minds as to who is to blame. The bottom line is that this disaster is still having a large impact on tens of thousands of people who the media has forgotten about.

2666510,5,B000J10F14,"Spike Lee's chronicle of Katrina's advent, arrival, and aftermath is one of the most passionate, emotional, vibrant films of the last twenty years. It will move you to anger, sorrow, happiness, love, and best of all, an understanding of the amazing fragility and transitory nature of human life when confronted with epic destruction.

When Americans cheered at Emmerich's epic disaster film, ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" little did we suspect that a disaster very much like it would be carved into the consciousness of our society, but this time with REAL victims. Worse still, Lee's film shows, brilliantly, the total incapacity of human civilization to deal with natural catastrophe on an epic scale. It also shows, with a very human face, the inner torture and destruction of those who did not die in the disaster, but were left behind to watch hopelessness suck their life away.

Spike Lee has made many amazing, controversial, and passionate films. NONE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT THIS ONE! The scenes, images, and tales contained in this masterwork are raw, angry, painful, and so vibrantly alive that it is mindblowing.

2666511,5,B000J10F14,"When the levees broke in New Orleans it came to be one of the most telling events about American Society. Poverty literally came floating to the surface. For those living outside the US the disaster was a cynical awakening. What is perceived as one of the richest nations in the world, a nation of opportunity and promise, suddenly looked like a third world country. Of course everyone in Europe is aware of the polarisation that is inhibited in the American social economical and political system, but it never became as clear during this disaster. Even though one could look at the disaster from an ecological point of view, it is mainly the social economical and political point of view Spike Lee's taking in this documentary.

The film takes four hours to tell the ""tale"" behind the New Orleans catastrophe, putting the spotlight on nearly every aspect of the disaster. The documentary's main strength is that it tells the tale though the eyes of New Orleans natives and politicians as well, ""When the Levees Broke"" seem to give a fair and balanced view of the events surrounding New Orleans. Governor Kathleen Blanco, Mayor Ray Nagin, Wynton Marsalis and Harry Belafonte are familiar faces for Europeans but are not those who keep the film alive. It's the tales of ordinary people in the street, from the Lower Ninth Ward and the better parts of New Orleans, who grab your attention and do not let you go during the full four hours Spike takes to tell the story of Katrina.

A lot of the images shown are familiar to us, the images of a crammed and crowded Super Dome, images of looting, people on the roof tops, some images less so, mainly the images of the bodies floating, the debris scattered across the city months later and New Orleans citizens displaced through out the nation months later. ""When the Levees Broke"" paints a very complete picture of this catastrophe, without going in to the political ramifications portrait here, one cannot help but watch this movie without a growing feeling of anger in your gut. Through out the film it becomes clear that politicians abandoned its constituents long before the disaster and hardly felt any urgency or compassion when Katrina hit. It becomes painfully clear that most politicians do not know what is going on in the ""bottom"" of society and worse, they might not even care.

Cut throughout the movie is the music of New Orleans. Spike makes sparse use of the city's music as if he wants to avoid drawing a public who'll pick up the music for the carnival and turn a blind eye to the human catastrophe. The main focus is on funeral music; as if Lee wants to say that Katrina could be the death blow to the city if we don't act as a nation. Yet the joyous sub-text of the New Orleans funeral marching bands also harbour a promise of a city that could rise again.",1164499200,16,2822,4.651302605210421
2666512,5,B000J10F14,"Out of many documentaries and specials that have come out on Hurricane Katrina, this is by far the documentary for the people. As a New Orleans local, I took pride in the fact that someone of Spike Lee's stature came and made this film. It is very in-depth and sheds a new light on exactly what went on here in the days leading up to and following Katrina, all the way to our present day situation. Many feared that this would be a racially biased film, however nothing could be further from the truth. Spike Lee interviews a wide range of people of all colors and walks of life (including federal, state and local officials). If this film is biased toward anyone, it is the people who live here and went through this and still struggle with it from day to day. Spike's voice is seldom heard throughout as he lets the survivors tell their stories of heartache and frustration over a government that essentially turned their back for FIVE DAYS as American citizens lay dying in the streets.",1160611200,20,989,4.5307262569832405

I've ordered this and had to have it replaced twice due to disc 2 freezing in the spot each time.  Would suggest Amazon have better quality control of their suppliers.,1525564800,,281,4.264150943396227

Greed and wealth is all they care about.  In my world, when disaster hits, we come together to help our fellow humans and our world. We show compassion and try to guide those who need assistance. We send help for those who can't afford emergency transport when the idiot Mayor blatantly denies offers from train and bus lines for FREE transportation for New Orleans citizens pre-storm, when he ordered a MANDATORY evacuation. He even acknowledged in his press interview that many residents rely on public transport, yet he provided nothing. Not to mention the sick, or elderly would have an impossible task trying to evacuate without proper help. What a disgrace. In my world we put people in positions of power, who have love and compassion for their fellow humans and for the environment that is set up to protect us in this world.",1507939200,,996,4.724137931034483

I especially liked that there was no loud inappropriate music and no narrator as is usual in documentaries. I have never seen anything produced by Spike Lee before but it would be GREAT if he could do another follow-up documentary on how things have progressed, or not, to the present. This is something that every American should watch.",1501891200,,480,4.593023255813954
8148713,5,B000J10F14,"This is one of the best productions I believe Spike Lee may have ever produced, and I wish it was longer. You need to watch the whole series, not one part of five, and jump to a conclusion which is what the vast majority of the one and two star reviewers did. This is not all about race either, and that needs to be understood, albeit it certainly was clearly a partial motive. The gov't wanted to gentrify the area, and with homeowners abandoning property or being killed, it most certainly helped the gov't do so. Have an open-mind when watching this and come to your own conclusion, but the ""pull yourself up by the boot straps"" mentality will unlikely fair well watching this.",1499299200,,680,4.491935483870968

Simple research on Google will tell you that FQ sits above the sea level thats why it wasn't damaged as much. Brains. It helps to use it sometimes. And the levees were blown to food the 9th ward to save someone else. Are you freaking serious right now????",1498089600,4,396,4.591549295774648
