7730115,4,B01E2F5JAY,"Great import Blu-ray, having trouble playing the bloopers and trailer (Possibly in PAL format) otherwise it plays just fine on my PS3.  Nice reversible cover.  The 5.1 DTS track is at about half the bit-rate normal DTS tracks are, but it's nothing special, kinda spacious up front but not in the surround.  there is also a 2.0 lossless audio track, but it's kinda tinny and seems to be mono in actuality.  there is 3 cuts of the film on the disc, besides the main feature as I discussed, there is an unrated cut, and a directors cut, both with only 2.0 sound, and both are in standard definition, and of varying quality, but nice to have for reference.
The movie itself is actually not horrible, and a great 80's action flick.  It's not a bad adaptation of the character, chuck full of 80's action cliche's which-let's face it-The Punisher is kind of a product of those hard nosed 70's and 80's movie cops like Dirty Harry and so on.",1489449600,3,933,4.497041420118343
7730116,5,B01E2F5JAY,Now finally i got the best punisher on blu ray with dolph lundgern and Louis gossip Jr now this is the 1989 version and i finally got to see the version with the deleted scenes in it now you can tell the difference with the footage it's like a old VHS tape and plus the music is different and their is a unrated cut which i didn't get to watch yet and the original version which is a lot clear in hd the DVD was now on the back it might say region b but it's region free and plus i didn't have any problems starting my gagreal and the theatraical trailer like some reviews said they did so if skip the 2004 punisher and return to where it started on blu ray you won't be dissapointed buy the results of umbrella the makers of this blu ray,1487289600,,738,3.9932432432432434

7730118,4,B01E2F5JAY,"Says region B, but does play on region A bluray players. Original and Unrated cut looks great. Workprint cut looks like vhs, but that's what a Workprint is. Gag real does not play. Altogether, I'm happy I finally have Punisher 1989 on bluray.",1485734400,4,242,4.651162790697675

7730120,5,B01E2F5JAY,"Blu Ray - 4/5: Pertaining to Umbrella Ent. version. This Blu Ray comes with 3 cuts of the movie. One is the theatrical cut with has good picture and $#!+. 2nd cut is the UNCUT version which they added all the extended violent scenes which were pretty bloody. Unfortunately, the additions of these extended bloody crap changes the picture quality making the picture oscillate from nice picture to blurred picture and it can get annoying. But hey, I'll get use to it. The 3rd cut is the Goldblatt cut which is the extended cut of additional scenes and all that. The picture quality is VHS quality at best but it's nice to see a different version of the film, I suppose. Also this Blu Ray comes with an audio commentary, two interviews and gag reel which CAN'T PLAY and a trailer that can't be played either. To add to the confirmation, it says Region B but does play on my Region A Blu Ray player.

Movie - 4/5: I love this version of the Punisher. I felt they did the Punisher right with this movie because, considering the comics were influenced by b-movie action movies, it seemed fitting. The action was awesome, the story is good enough and the acting was stiff and great.",1483401600,12,1175,4.490654205607477
7730121,5,B01E2F5JAY,"Australian import. Box says Region B only, but I also have confirmed it will play on Region A devices. Everything played fine for me, but NO PLAYBACK for the Gag Reel or the Theatrical Trailer. I have watched this film on multiple formats and this is the best I have ever seen it - beautiful HD quality for the Theatrical Cut. The Uncut version is SD. The Workprint looks like a bad VHS tape, but it DOES look better than the older, German Workprint version I've seen on DVD. Who knows when we'll see a U.S. release? Worth purchasing if you like this movie and want to upgrade your old DVD version.",1474329600,20,598,4.348214285714286
7730122,5,B01E2F5JAY,"Australian Distributor Umbrella entertainment
somehow got the rights to the Theatrical version of the Punisher, Dolph Lundgren's version
but Umbrella also got the rights to the Unrated cut version & the Longer workprint version aswell
the Longer workprint version got a dvd release way back in 2004 by German Distributor Starlightfilms
which is out of print now so the workprint version hasn't been reissued since until now
Australia blu-ray's have the same region as U.K. blu-ray's region B, incase you didn't know that
but i tested the Blu-ray on my player anyway and the Disc plays region A
so the Disc is region free even thou region B is printed on the back cover so any U.S. fan can buy this new blu-ray for sure
and amazon's product details says region B, well that's wrong the Disc is ABC
alright about the 3 versions on this Disc
the 1st is of course the 89min Theatrical cut in new 1:85:1 1080p HD transfer with new 5.1 master mix
the picture quality looks very Good, very nice sharp & clear quality much better than the old dvd version
the 5.1 mix is also very Good boost in sound quality
the 2nd version is the Unrated version which also has new 1:85:1 HD transfer probably the same transfer as the Theatrical version
 this Unrated version is very close runtime to the Theatrical cut so probably 1min of extra violence in the Unrated cut
the 3rd version is my favourite version of the film it's the Longer workprint version runtime is 105min
it has scenes of Frank castle with his family and other scenes so the workprint is more character based with action mixed in
this is the first time it's been reissued on blu-ray
the workprint is the way the film was intended to be released in cinemas by Director Mark Goldblatt
tragically it was decided to edited the film before it was released to cinemas back in 1989
Umbrella has surprisingly done a Great Job restoring the workprint so it's tolerable to watch
Definitely has not been given HD transfer, the picture quality been Digital remastered if that, from a master tape source,
the sound quality is Dolby stereo mix so the quality is definitely clearer than an old VHS copy that's for sure
the screen ratio is somewhere between 1:33:1-1:85:1 there's no black bars on either side of the screen
so the film seems to to fit widescreen anyway
there's also new extras
new interview with Director Mark Goldblatt & Dolph Lundgren
plus new commentary with Mark Goldblatt on the Unrated version
plus Theatrical trailer & also a Gag reel
this new blu-ray reissue is the Ultimate version of the 1989 version for sure and it's all regions
so don't waste your money on the U.K. Anchor bay blu-ray which only has theatrical trailer
this Australian blu-ray is the version to buy, 5 stars for it based on 3 version of the film plus new extras",1473724800,16,2789,4.634343434343434
7730123,1,B01E2F5JAY,This was not advertised as a region B disc. Complete waste of money if you live in America.,1506384000,,91,4.111111111111111
7730124,5,B01E2F5JAY,Awesome movie! Loved it as a kid and happy I got the Blu-ray which is hard to find,1504915200,,82,3.611111111111111
7730125,4,B01E2F5JAY,"The Punisher Blu-ray release by Australian based DVD manufacturing company, Umbrella, is one of the examples of Region Free release with high quality video available to stateside buyers. While the case and classification clearly state Region B it works just fine on American Blu-ray player. I have tested it on two so far. A modern LG model and an older Sony model.

The release features the main theatrical cut converted to 1080p. As well as standard definition cuts of the Workprint and Unrated cut. The biggest thing here is the fifteen minute longer Workprint which includes the deleted origin you only witness in flashbacks. Video quality is fine, but blemished and the best I have seen for this material you can find on the web. The audio has a temporary score and other unfinished parts. The Unrated cut adds less than a minute of extra gore and violence and comes with a nice commentary track with director, Mark Goldblatt.

Also on the disc is two interviews one long interview with the director and a shorter, impromptu interview with Dolph at a fitness club. A gag reel and theatrical trailer are included but do not work because of an authoring error. I was only able to access them through my PC's Blu-ray drive. The trailer is an unimpressive SD 4x3 VHS trailer. The Gag reel is interesting behind the scenes look at production in Australia placed to the tune of Talking Heads Psycho Killer. Periodically, the audio of the reel chimes in to the laughter of the cast.

The Blu-ray comes in a nice hard plastic case with a reversible slipcover. The reverse side featuring some rather cartoony Punisher art.

Overall, as a mega-fan of the movie in America, I was pleased with this import. The only issues I have are the authoring problems and the weird reverse slipcover.",1503964800,6,1782,4.775974025974026
7730126,5,B01E2F5JAY,"This film did not get a USA movie release  to theaters in the 80's when it was made, but it has a well deserved cult following today. And it should, for  this is a high quality action film. Based on the Marvel comic. This movie has Dolph Lungren in the role of Frank Castle the Punisher .The story is the same one told in all of the Marvel Punisher films. Basically bad guys need to be taken out and killed. Unlike Batman who tries not to kill, the Punisher has no problem killing the bad guys in a bloody gory fashion and that is the reason for the R rating. The action is brutal and bloody
The Bluray has the unrated version so there are scenes and additions not in previous releases of the movie.
Dolph is an excellent Punisher and the movie is very entertaining . This Punisher Bluray has excellent extras such as commentary and a work print of the movie.
Punisher or Lungren fans will enjoy adding this to their collections. Good Stuff!",1503446400,4,941,4.340909090909091

7730131,4,B01E2F5JAY,Cool movie. Just saw for first time. As stated it does play in ps3 minus gag real. But I saw gag real in my other region free player and you're not missing anything. It's just a quick b-roll footage of the crew.,1493164800,,211,4.0476190476190474

8757561,3,B01E2F5JAY,"Great to see this on blu-ray, but I don't really understand why BD. It would look the same on DVD as it has all of the quality of an 80s movie with scratches and fuzziness of a VHS tape. Meh. It's too bad, since even certain scenes have movement like a handheld video camera is recording the transfer for beat-up old elements, and the result placed on BD. Horrible transfer of a really decent movie. If you've never seen this, the price is good enough to have in your collection...just don't expect it to look good on a larger 1080p screen. I found it barely tolerable on my computer screen.

Instead, just pop some popcorn and pretend it's the 80's again and you just popped in a VHS tape. Sit back and enjoy!",1512518400,,710,4.338345864661654
