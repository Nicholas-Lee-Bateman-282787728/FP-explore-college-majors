In one scene, she sang along to the National Anthem in front of the TV at the end of the day, just before they went off the air.  I remember when they used to actually did that.  Now, no channel goes off the error.  They stopped that long before Curly Sue came out.  She had evidently sang the National Anthem at some event(s), so they worked that in.  She was a bit pitchy, but good for her age.  She sang a few bars of another song in a different scene, and was on pitch when she sang that son.",1459209600,2,627,3.9919354838709675

871551,2,6304340532,A modern day ShirleyTemple imitation that falls flat.  The little girl is too smart mouthed and tough. She doesn't have the sweetness and goodness of Shirley Temple's characters.  The main character's transformation from hard-as-nails top lawyer to a softee didn't seem the least bit believable. She had no chemistry with the foster father that she took in off the streets after he and the little girl  scammed her.  It didn't ring true even as a fairy tale.  It was nice the way he seemed to really love the little girl even though he could never give her a home and he taught her to be a scam artist.

It is so refreshing to see films like this than violent Hollywood trash! They have made good films ie When Harry met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle and You've got mail!

But Grey is touched, and over the objections of her snotty fiance, insist on putting the two up for the night. As they get to know each other, Bill becomes convinced that this is where Curly Sue belongs - in a home, cared for by someone that can give her the advantages that his homeless, nomadic existence lacks. He plans to leave the young girl in the care of Grey and take off, but Curly Sue has other ideas. A heart-warming and wonderful movie that will stay with you years after you see it.

873923,5,6304340532,"""Curly Sue"" has the kind of premise that, usually, end up being only partially realized in movies.  They end up good, but with a feeling that they could have been a lot better.  In ""Curly Sue"", the title little girl and her father are homeless people who get by through pulling low-scale little scams - when the dad pretends to, say, be hit by a very expensive-looking car and mildly hurt, the two of them can often end up receiving a sympathy meal at a nice restaurant and perhaps even a place to stay for the night.  (It sounds depressing, but it isn't - it skirts the path of being too downcast for a family movie without trivializing the issues it's depicting)  After one incident, the woman Curly's dad Bill pretends to be injured by ends up taking them into her home; and despite her being engaged (to an approriately unlikable boor), the woman (named Grey) and Bill begin to have feelings for one another, even as Grey finds herself becoming quickly attached to Curly Sue.

  At your local video store, you'll most likely find this one in the Family Movie section, where it'll easily be amongst the cream of the crop in those aisles.  But it's also an uproarious comedy that outshines ninety per cent of the titles in the comedy section, and more genuinely moving and dramatic than most movies on the Drama shelves.  ""Curly Sue"" hits every note it plays to perfection, has smashing performances (including James Belushi in his best role as Bill, Kelly Lynch as Grey, and Allison Porter unforgettable as the dynamic pint-sized fireball of a title character), and doesn't at all end up in the class of movies that are ""good, but really should have been better"" - it's the opposite, going well above even the high end of the potential one would think it has.  An alltime winner.",1169424000,26,1782,4.610759493670886
873924,4,6304340532,"This a great movie. I saw it when it first came out in 1991 and have liked it ever since. It has a bittersweet storyline about a little girl, and her adoptive father who start out by trying to con a single, rich divorce lawyer out of funds, and end up building a family relationship with her. They teach her what it means to have a family and that there are things beyond money and work.  She in turn shows them what having a home can really be like. The story is a timeless mix of comedy and drama. Sad and dark and times, and happy at others, it tells a realistic story of what it might be like to be homeless and parentless. Recommended for adults and kids 9 and up.",1132704000,35,669,4.068181818181818
873925,3,6304340532,"This is John Hughes's last film (to date) as a director and marks a change in focus from his previous work where he had focussed more on teenagers than small children. The expert view of teenage life given in Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club gives way to a rather Hollywood view of cutesy tots. Stage school moppet Alisan Porter is only a short step away from singing 'Tomorrow, Tomorrow' or 'Animal Crackers In My Soup' and both the performance and writing jar somewhat in an otherwise well-made film. Belushi is an amiable anti-hero as the tramp that gets helped out by the mega-rich lawyer, but Kelly Lynch's character is somewhat clichd. Do lawyers really get paid as much in America as film and television would have you believe? If so, no wonder people dislike them so much.
One thing that amused me is that the central characters of the Con man and little smart-alec adopted daughter are almost identical to those in the film Paper Moon. In fact, this film is more or less an unacknowledged sequel to that story, with the exception that the backdrop of the depressed 1930s gives way to the affluent 1980s.
There is a pretty good musical score here finishing with a great little song from Ringo Starr as the credits roll. It's a sweet film, but would have been better with a different central character.",1007337600,4,1315,4.672413793103448
