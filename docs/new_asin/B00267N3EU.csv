3852812,5,B00267N3EU,"Tim and Eric is a different type of comedy that you will either hate or love. There is no in between. You need a certain type of sense of humor to watch it and like it. I think that these two are brilliant comedians. They are so clever in there work. Season Three is just as good as the first two seasons, if not better.",1251676800,3,320,3.9384615384615387

However if you are like me and you cant get enough of this show, then you will love this DvD. The extras are hilarious (Gettin' It Dunn is a personal favorite) and of course the episodes are unforgettable. The only beef I have with this DvD is that it has no commentary. T&EASGJ! season 1 had commentary on the DvD and I loved it, season 2 and 3 don't and I wish they did. However this is still a sweet DvD so get it.",1250121600,,509,3.9514563106796117
3852815,5,B00267N3EU,"The caribou is in the order of Artioldactyl and is a member of the deer family. It looks like a large mule deer or small elk with soft hollow hair, long legs, large hooves and large antlers. In Alaska, 97 to 99 percent of the females have antlers as well as the males. Both male and female caribou have blunt muzzles with hair all the way down to the muzzle.  Although the caribou looks like a deer, they are different from other members of their family in many ways. They are not too shy (unless in common hunting area), they are capable of sleeping in water, and are herd animals that are always on the move. This tamable animal likes to eat moss and lay in the shade, but they hate the nasty flies that bite them, and lay their eggs in their back. The flies are one reason the caribou is always on the move, the other reason is that caribou eat moss called lichen  that takes years to grow back.  Caribou are wild, if they are domesticated they are called reindeer. Eurasians do not use the name caribou at all, they use the terms wild and domestic reindeer. Arctic people hunt caribou for the good meat and warm hide so they have names for caribou to specify age and gender; three of them are pagnnig (adult bull), julanak (adult female) and norraq (calf).",1249430400,9,1260,4.353191489361702

3852817,1,B00267N3EU,"Inside the nebula, Kirk uses Khan's inexperience in three-dimensional combat to critically disable the Reliant. Mortally wounded, Khan activates the Genesis Device, which will reorganize all matter in the nebula--including the Enterprise. Though Kirk's crew detects the activation of the Genesis Device and begins to lumber away using impulse engines, with the warp drive damaged they will not be able to escape the nebula in time. Spock goes to the ship's Engineering section to restore warp drive. When McCoy tries to prevent Spock's exposing himself to high levels of radiation, he disables the doctor and tells him to ""remember"". Spock restores power to the ship, allowing the Enterprise to escape the explosion. Kirk arrives in Engineering just before Spock dies of radiation poisoning.

The explosion of the Genesis Device causes a planet to coalesce out of the nebula. A space burial is held in the Enterprise's torpedo room and Spock's coffin is shot into orbit around the newly formed planet. The crew leaves the planet to pick up the Reliant's marooned crew from Ceti Alpha V. In the final scene Spock's coffin is seen to have soft-landed on the planet. Spock narrates Star Trek's ""Where no man has gone before"" monologue as the view moves forward into a field of stars.",1246406400,14,1280,5.0663507109004735

3852886,4,B00267N3EU,"Tim and Eric are the greatest comedy team since Monty Python. It pains me deeply to give this only four stars, but that's the sad truth. The sketches on Season 3 are far below the level of comedy they delivered on seasons 1 + 2. Most of these episodes are pretty good, but some of the sketches seem like repeat plays of old sketches, only a lot less funny. I still laugh hysterically any time I watch the other seasons, but this season seems pretty forced. While the other seasons had about 5 knockout sketches in each episode, this season has about 1 knockout sketch each episode. There's also a significant lack of appearances by Dr. Steve Brull, Richard Dunn, and David Lieb Harte. They each appear about 3 times across the ten episodes. I'm really hoping they get back to their swing in season 4.",1280966400,,800,4.486301369863014

3852908,5,B00267N3EU,"I have been watching 'Tim and Eric' for over a year now and the only thing that can compare to it is Tommy Wiseau's 'the room', a masterpiece of surreal comedy that was unintentional (making it even more remarkable). It is impossible to explain what is funny about an elderly Indian man on a carpet grabbing his stomach and yelling 'great job' while the infinitely talented Doug Lussenhop manipulates his action and turns it into a song of sorts. The music is fantastic and will stick in your mind for days on end and if you watch the show and do not find yourself screaming 'shrimp' at the top of your voice at the mere mention of 'white wine' then you may want your life signs confirmed. As mentioned, the only thing that can compare to such inane humor is 'the room', but Tim and Eric understand this completely and have headhunted him to direct an episode for season four, simply entitled 'Tommy'. For those who live in America and are baffled by the bizarre and highly inaccurate comparisons to the overrated and one-dimensional 'The Mighty Boosh', I can only humbly suggest that they check out an English genius by the name of Chris Morris, particularly 'Brass Eye' and 'Jam'. It is almost in the league of 'The Room' for surreal comedy, but let's face it, the best produce comes from the truly deranged.",1257811200,5,1310,4.602564102564102
3852909,5,B00267N3EU,"I love these guys! And season three is so far the greatest!!
I don't see how it's like mighty boosh in any way, sorry other reviewer people. I find it way different. They're only the same if you're completely generalizing in the way that it's off the wall, but other wise the two styles are far different. These guys do more of a sketch comedy format, mighty boosh does a whole random story through.. and they have an ongoing joke about everyone being in love with Vince..which has finally gotten to me. So no, not like that show.

Williams Street needs to up productiona values a bit, allowing more commentaries and maybe throwing in some of Eric's music videos and/or some of the Jim and Derrick Spring Break shorts.

3852913,5,B00267N3EU,"Tim and Eric have done it again with season 3. It is a mix of moments that make you laugh out loud and other times that you are like What the hell was that?! But it is in a good way because this show is refreshingly different from anything else out there. People past there 30s would probably not 'get' this show because it is like nothing they grew up with. In this generation of ridiculousness from corporate sponsors and censors, it is nice to see a show that demonstrates you are not alone in being disgusted by it. A particular gem of season 3 is the Jim and Derrick episode, which feels like watching any programming geared toward teens but takes it to extremes. A beautiful job of mocking today's mtv crowd. Many hilarious celebrities make appearances #I'm sure others have dropped the names#. Black Francis of The Pixies contributes to the season finale. The unique musical numbers throughout this season are both funny and imaginative. DVD Extras include bloopers and extra scenes which are also entertaining to varying extents. I would recommend watching the first 2 seasons in order to understand some of the runners, but season 3 can be enjoyed on its own too. It's pretty cheap anyway, so if you want something different from the same old sitcoms and boring police dramas, check this out.

If you are or become a Tim and Eric fan, definitely look for Tom Goes to the Mayor too.",1251936000,,1390,4.604838709677419
