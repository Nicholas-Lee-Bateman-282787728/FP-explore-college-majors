3883604,5,B00271RHO2,Really enjoyed learning more about this story.  Well done.,1482451200,,58,5.444444444444445
3883605,4,B00271RHO2,"The 411: Last night the family and I watched The Last Descent a true story of John Jones who while cave crawling in Nutty Putty Cave in Utah gets himself in a jam and needs a miracle.

While watching the movie I felt this was a must see. Obviously the writers take creative liberties with the story but after researching afterward and checking into the details of this real event I feel it is important to watch this movie for so many reasons but mostly for the hopefulness we all crave at the end of our days.

The movie is very well done and the actors do a great job. We see John's life story in a series of flashbacks as he talks to the many rescuers who tried to help him. In the movie the main rescuer is named Aaron. Aaron and John's conversations make up most of the movie and I was completely engrossed and praying for the best although I already knew the ending.

John was 26 with a small child and another on the way. It is the way the movie focuses on that unborn baby that gives me chills even now.

This is a must see!",1482019200,5,1032,4.119402985074627
3883606,4,B00271RHO2,"My Rating: 3.5 Stars! I thought it was well done. The actors did a great job, and I was totally sucked into the story. It's difficult to watch in some parts because of his suffering, but there are many important lessons and morals to be learned. There's no profanity or ""intimacy"" beyond a few brief kisses. There isn't any violence either, but the man is trapped underground in a cave, upside down, for over 24 hours, and it's really hard to watch him suffer. It has a PG rating, but I would recommend it for kids and adults 13 years-old and up. I think it's a little too much for those younger viewers.

3883607,4,B00271RHO2,"I'm a big fan of a happy ending, so when I was given the chance to review The Last Descent (a film based on the true story of a failed rescue attempt) I was a bit hesitant. However, my curiosity won out-I knew there must be more to this film than just depicting the loss. When the DVD arrived I started second guessing my decision to review it, BUT I am really happy that I took the time to watch this beautiful film.

It is definitely sad, but not a crushing, depressing sadness. There are scenes of joy and light throughout the film (mostly through flashbacks), and the way it ends actually feels hopeful and happy.

When the credits were rolling I had some questions. A day later I'm still thinking about the movie (and isn't that a sign of powerful art-when you keep thinking about it?). This is based on a true story, but obviously with over 127 viewpoints (at least that many people were involved in the rescue attempt), it does take artistic license. I wanted Aaron (the lead rescuer) to be real, and I wanted to know more about him. He's a composite of many rescuers; however, I'm left hoping that both through the actual event and this film that peoples lives were (or will be) touched.

The Last Descent is a film worth watching.",1481760000,7,1239,4.425438596491228
3883608,4,B00271RHO2,"First, the disclaimer. ""I was provided a free DVD. All opinions are my own."" That done, THE LAST DESCENT is a drama that is edge of the seat. Even though anyone who reads the blurb knows the ultimate outcome, they are watching with baited breath as rescue attempts are made. We relive his romance with Emily, rejoice with them in their relationship and as the family grows, then cry as the pulley system breaks, the cave collapses and some rescues are made... and some are not.

The words at the end of the DVD are kind of hard to read, pale blue background and white  print, and my entire family cried, but we decided it deserves a solid 4 stars.",1481500800,,647,4.383333333333334
3883609,5,B00271RHO2,Very well done based on a true story.  They focus on his life more than the tragedy that took place and that was good.  It is a good clean movie that everyone can enjoy.,1480982400,2,169,3.9411764705882355

3883616,4,B00271RHO2,"When I received a request to view this film for review, I was very hesitant.  I am not good with tragedies.  I knew how this one was going to end.  I took my time responding to the request and missed the tour.  The wonderful publicist (Thanks Michelle) sent me a copy to review even though I missed the tour.

The DVD begins with the birth of a baby boy and then takes the viewer to meeting John, his wife, his daughter, and his brother, Josh.  The movie starts out with the brothers going to Nutty Putty Cave to explore.  I honestly paced around as he went off on his own.  It took a bit for me to settle myself down to listen as John tells of his life and his family.

While the movie is full of heartbreak, there is peace and hope.  I enjoyed watching how Search and Rescue keeps hope up in terrible situations.  The fact is that this tragedy affected many wonderful people.  I also enjoyed the flashbacks as he talked about meeting his wife and other key life events.

When all seems lost, there is hope.  That is the message of the movie.  There is peace and hope.

I received a complimentary copy of this DVD.  I was not required to leave a positive review.",1485216000,3,1163,4.237442922374429

3883619,3,B00271RHO2,"Ugh.  It's almost impossible to review movies like this one.  It's based on a true story and honestly, it's just sad.  I know it was supposed to inspire me, and I came out of it feeling extraordinarily grateful, but I was just not inspired.  I was sad.

John Jones and his brother decide to go explore the Nutty Putty cave in Utah.  They weren't well equipped and they just shouldn't have gone in that cave as unprepared as they were.  It is well know to be dangerous.  Long story short is John gets stuck.  Wedged in an impossible position, upside down.  It's horrifying.

My gratitude expands for the many, many people who fought so hard to save him.  Emergency crews, rescue crews, the sheriff's department, doctors and so many more, working so hard and trying for so long.  So many people giving their all to try to save this one man from a very dangerous circumstance at personal risk to them all.  That is amazing to me and shows the best part of humanity.

As the movie goes on, we get glimpses into John's past, including the courtship of his wife.  It's a sweet story, but just made the reality of his situation all the more heartbreaking.  John is a champion through it all- so humble and grateful.  But in the end, he still dies.  It's just sad.  The whole deal.  Sad.

So, if you want a tear jerker story- this is your movie.  If you are into movies based on true stories, then you should check this one out.  If you have a loved one who loves to explore caves, you should NOT watch this movie.  :)",1483660800,8,1510,4.345323741007194
3883620,5,B00271RHO2,"I knew going in to this that it would be emotional since it documents the final hours of John Jones' life in the Nutty Putty Cave. He gets caught in a hole in the cave very early on and we get flashbacks of his life as a rescue worker stays with him until they can pull him out.

This movie is well done! There are a few intense scenes when John gets stuck and then when the rescuers attempt to pull him out. He reflects on his life and expresses his regrets as well as the things that have brought him great joy. His relationship with his wife, Emily, was what he focused on the most, and it was interesting to hear their story. Most of his conversations happen with a rescue worker named Aaron, who takes a deep interest in John and is determined to get him out alive. I enjoyed all the actors and thought they did a great job portraying the different characters and bringing this story to life.

The bottom line on this movie is that, yes, it's hard to watch at times due to John's suffering, but there are happy parts as well. It contains a powerful message which will stick with me for a long time!

I received a copy to view. All thoughts and opinions are my own.",1482796800,,1169,4.1866666666666665
3883621,4,B00271RHO2,"First, let me say that I am a caver and a Paramedic. This film is the first cave-related film I've seen that accurately depicts a  cave environment with tight passages & intermittent helmet-mounted lighting (with the obvious exception of some subtly placed addition back-light, which any film would require). The film left me with a few technical rescue questions, but the average viewer wouldn't notice. The story is more focused on the life of the victim than the rescue itself. It was tough to watch, but a good film.",1482537600,5,520,4.842696629213483

8359180,4,B00271RHO2,"The movie is decent at telling the story, but I was expecting something that created a little more intensity.  Granted, I read everything I could find about this incident before watching the movie.  I think I felt the anxiety for days after reading about it.  The movie seemed to water down the details and intensity of the rescue attempt.
It is more about him than the rescue, I get it, and I am glad I watched the movie.  Makes me wonder why I have survived some of the dumb things I did when I was younger.  I always wanted to get back into caving, but learning about this kind of tragedy, and having kids, really makes you question the risks. My heart aches for his family and I wish peace for them after such pain.",1518134400,,719,4.296296296296297
8359181,5,B00271RHO2,"Before seeing this movie I had not heard the story. People who call it out on acting and dialogue, ease up! I replayed parts of it, and realized the dialogue was very realistic, and certainly not action hero buzz lines. Those whove said it is not faithful to what really happened in the tunnel need also relax. This is a movie and there are limitations.

Take the character Aaron. The movie did a good job of using him as the representative of many people who were involved. As John got weaker, it might even be reasonable to consider he may not have been able to distinguish one from the next. Also for that reason, the flashbacks and dream sequences fit. Whos to say what was going through his mind?

I like this movie for very much the same reasons I like Castaway - it does a good job of getting inside the head of a character who faces an incredible challenge. While, it seems, much of the movie going public expects to see a movie to be entertained, or maybe to be educated, I appreciate a film that attempts to deal with the internal struggle a human being might face.

I recommend this movie. John is every man. He died tragically. Theres no Hollywood ending. Theres so much sadness. Theres denial, heroism, hopelessness, tears. Its a good film that makes you think. Worth watching.",1511136000,2,1290,4.504273504273504
