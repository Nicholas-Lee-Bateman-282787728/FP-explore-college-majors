8431236,4,B004ITWEL2,I am a big Armin Van Buuren fan and seen some parts of this Blu-ray on youtube and liked it. So I bought it. It is disappointing that both the DVD and the Blu-ray disc's will not play in any of my Blu-ray players.,1380672000,,213,3.8636363636363638
8431237,1,B004ITWEL2,also the dvd itself lacks movement and excitement once i finally played the non hd version on my pc....only recommend if in europe and like more laid back EDM,1376179200,,158,4.482758620689655

8431239,5,B004ITWEL2,Great show by Armin. First saw it on Youtube. Had to get the Blu-ray. Watch it several times and enjoy it every time. Nadia Ali is wonderful of course.,1365638400,,151,4.241379310344827
8431240,5,B004ITWEL2,"This was a great show from Armin, It works perfect on my Blu Ray player, some people cant get it to play, maybe they need to update their software on their Blu Ray player, however this Blu Ray is awesome! There are some great vocalists Armin brings along, Like Nadia Ali, Enjoy! Buy!",1351123200,,283,4.3584905660377355
8431241,1,B004ITWEL2,The Blu ray did not play on my system. It was an international version and not described as promised. Guarantee was specified but not granted.,1348358400,,142,4.72

This is a Region 2 Release. Discs are NOT ALL Region!",1334793600,,107,3.909090909090909
8431244,1,B004ITWEL2,"Beware when purchasing this product!  I purchased this from vendor: Import CDs (Amazon.com) and unfortunately none of the disks work.  I'm not sure if it's fake, but the packaging that arrived looked legit.  I tried it on several blueray/dvd players that we owned inside the house and none of it works.  I purchased it after borrowing the DVD from a friend.  The show itself is truly EPIC!!! If you really like the Imagine DVD, you will love this DVD...when and if it works!",1326499200,,474,4.662650602409639
