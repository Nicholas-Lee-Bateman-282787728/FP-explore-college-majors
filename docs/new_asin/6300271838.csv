293264,1,6300271838,"This is a very odd movie, which Leonard Maltin amusingly calls financial science fiction. Director Alan J Pakula is in one of his paranoid conspiracy theory moods a la Parallax View and All the Presidents Men, and as Jane Fonda's IPC company produced it, she thinks she's doing The China Syndrome. Apparently international currency is dependent on the Saudi Arabians whose ownership of oil makes them the richest people in the world. When they contemplate investing in gold rather than lending their wealth to support the banks, wall street fears a new world depression. This all sounds very scary until one wonders if the Arabs bankrupt everyone, what good will the gold be? One also wonders how seriously we are to take this when Pakula casts Kris Krisofferson, sans beard, as a banking troubleshooter! Casting Fonda as a former movie star who gave up her career to marry money is kind of prophetic consider her future marriage to Ted Turner. We aren't given a clue as to what kind of actress her character was, but the way Fonda is styled and lit suggests Joan Crawford, so then we can free associate Crawford with Pepsi and Al Steele. Whatever suspense Pakula is trying for is ruined by an awful music score by Michael Small, and the romance between Kristofferson and Fonda doesn't work either. Kristofferson is laughable as a he-man, and there is something icky in the idea that this is the kind of behaviour that Fonda responds to. There is also the unfortunate coincidence of their matching hairstyles - it recalls Lily Tomlin and John Travolta in Moment by Moment. One curiosity is the kind of computer software used at the time.",976665600,19,1637,4.808510638297872

293321,2,6300271838,"This movie has attracted a lot of reviews here from financial Illuminatists--folks praising ""Rollover"" as a rare, brave insider's look at how the global financial system Really Works. Even a kind of skeleton key presciently unlocking secrets of the 2008 financial crisis.

Anybody who's been doing their homework knows this is silly. Yes, everybody's connected to everybody else these days, banks very much included. But the film's '70s oil-crisis era paranoia about a financial crisis triggered by the Saudis selling off their U.S. bond holdings (in more recent years, substitute China for Saudi Arabia) is just financially illiterate. As I write this in late 2015, China has finally done exactly that--dumped billions of their dollar investments in an attempt to prop up their own faltering currency. That's triggered a great ... yawn from world markets. (To understand why this is no big deal--nor would have been if Saudi Arabia had done it forty years ago, Google ""Krugman China U.S. investment."" The fact that economist Krugman could predict and explain this uneventful outcome years before it occurred ought to give him a bit of credibility.)

The only thing ""Rollover"" has going for it is a typically strong performance from Jane Fonda. But the absence of either a coherent story or any effective drama makes her efforts a pretty thankless task--just like our efforts to get anything worthwhile out of this ponderous, fuzzy-headed mishmash.

As to movies that really do explain the 2008 global financial crisis, try the fascinating documentary ""Inside Job,"" and the very good ""Hollywood version,"" ""The Big Short.""",1451088000,,1621,5.250965250965251

293355,4,6300271838,"I found this movie after searching for others along the same lines as ""Wall Street"".  It's an older movie - 1981 - but entirely timely.  I find gutsy movies of this type both useful, mesmerizing, chilling, sinister and highly entertaining.  What's more, the best of these expose the grim inner workings of the financial sector - and truth is stranger than any fiction.  With my own extremely limited knowledge of ""the way office politics"" operate in a tiny little corner of the world, I find it all too easy to believe that this kind of corruption within the most powerful echelons not only exists but threatens us.  Money is the ""Great Enabler"", the tool of the trade - but it's not about money.  Money is never enough to slake the catalytic energy behind such as this - and it gives the financial term ""rollover"" a separate, occult meaning.

Within the context of how real people are drawn into a jigsaw vortex such as the one the plot denotes, I found Jane Fonda and Chris Christofferson to be believable in their roles not because of their looks and glamor, but in spite of it - because it went with the territory.  I felt both did credible jobs with their parts.  They were two people who had come to the pinnacle of their careers (she an actress who married into the money sector, he a Wall St. investment banker)  based on exuding such powerful physical attraction to those around them, complimented by their natural intelligence; and learning to their dismay that they were impotently outclassed just when they felt most in control.  Knowledge by those on the inside may be power, but unexpected knowledge of impending financial meltdown can bring the strong to their knees, perhaps even lower.  It clouds and twists all rational judgment as it spins the brain; it turns the thought process to lard when it is needed most.  The monster is larger than any of them.

The story is about collusion within the big banks, the Saudi oil scheme and the stock market; Jane Fonda has become a widow during the first moments of the film, because her banker husband has been murdered due to his knowledge of a secret bank account.  A ""too big to fail"" bank is teetering on the edge of insolvency and Christofferson is sent in to ""correct things"" because he is unwittingly a man who can be trusted by another man who can't be; when being too good at your job can be hazardous to the health; a struggling business owned by Fonda is promised overdraft protection in a covert deal, but is the bank promising the protection going under too, taking her with it?  And beneath it all is a squirming financial monster so large as to make our own ""fiscal cliff"" seem like a fledgling pigeon.

Perhaps the prophetic words uttered by the mastermind just before it all catches up to him too,  says it all - for that time and for this:  ""...if it isn't us, it will be somebody else.  It's going to happen anyway.""",1352505600,,2895,4.573643410852713

293391,4,6300271838,"Critics sniffed at this film back in 1981, but I enjoyed it, despite its obvious issues, and found it remarkably prescient; today the circumstances and pseudo-villains are different, but the plot is still as relevant as ever.

Last year, when the Fed created a trillion and a half dollars out of thin air, and used it to buy bailing wire and chewing gum to prop up the incredibly fragile house of cards that is our international financial system, I immediately thought of Hub Smith, Kristofferson's character, brainstorming a magical a rescue for Burrough National, the bank he's been tapped to save, even though it ""died six months ago and doesn't know it yet.""  His associate disparages his attitude:  ""This isn't some sort of game!""  ""Oh, yes it is,"" Hub replies.  ""That's exactly what it is.  We're up against the system, and you can't beat the system.  But you can win a game!""  And Hub does win that game, cheating financial death a bit longer, by persuading Jane Fonda's character to float a huge Arab loan to prop up her company, the bank's biggest client, which is ""even further in the s--thouse than we are, if that's possible.""  The Fed won their game too, in 2010, rescuing the too-big-to-fail financial conglomerates; but one wonders if, like Hub, they are just playing Monopoly-money games, postponing the inevitable.

Each time our precarious economy teeters on the brink we blame a creditor pseudo-villain; in the 60s it was Japan, in the 70s and 80s OPEC, and now China.  And each time it happens I'm reminded of Hub sitting in his office at 2 a.m., head in hands, waiting for the Hong Kong stock market to open, praying that the Arab pseudo-villians will roll over their mature bonds -- because if they don't, there will be no tomorrow for his bank; that's how close Burrough National is to the brink.  ""You're playing with the end of the world, you know,"" Hume Kronyn tells an OPEC official, who smiles.  ""The end of the world,"" he replies, ""as YOU know it.""

And that's the point here: The fault lies not with our creditors, but with us; with our incredible addiction to borrowing and spending, to building phony real estate bubbles, to launching recreational wars of conquest; and our absolute refusal to learn anything from our debacles.  And one can't help but imagine a day when our creditors decide enough is enough, and the Fed runs out of magical methods of conjuring money from nothing without triggering Brazilianesque malignant hyper-inflation, and the house of cards finally comes tumbling down -- the end of the world, as we know it.

Like other reviewers, I found the casting a bit curious -- Jane Fonda and Hume Kronyn, the only actors with real chops, seem completely out of their element -- movie stars slumming in a high school drama club production -- but forget the acting and pay attention to the message, which is real:  The end of the world could happen; it almost did in 2010.",1295827200,9,2919,4.737154150197629

293395,4,6300271838,"This film is what I'd call a financial thriller. While there are a few other movies that might conceivably belong to this rare genre, it's rare for a good reason: if you're not into the finer points of finance yourself, all the shop talk of markets and trading and financial panics in this kind of movie is likely to put you to sleep. As such, the target audience is rather limited.

As financial thrillers go, however, this one is rather good if you are in that target audience. Possibly in hopes of expanding the target audience a bit, this film also mixes some elements of an erotic thriller and a murder mystery into itself as well, but Fonda and Kristofferson both seem to be phoning in their sexual relationship and neither of their characters ever goes to any significant effort to find the murderer.

The erotic subplot serves mostly only as a metaphor to underline the financial story anyway; in other words, it's saying ""Think twice before getting into bed with people--literally *and* figuratively speaking."" As for the murder, it likewise serves to emphasize how high the stakes in finance are and how dangerous some of the players can be (providing Kristofferson with ample excuse to swear furiously and make a few idle threats of violence to show off his masculinity). Either subplot could probably have been left out altogether without doing the story any disservice, but the movie's pretty tightly scripted as it is and evidently Hollywood just didn't want to pass up any potential opportunity to expand its target audience.

Another category this movie might fit is the recently much-expanded disaster movie genre. Where most disaster movies attempt to dazzle our eyes with either a nuclear war or a massive natural disaster, however, Rollover provides us with an excellent dramatization of a financial apocalypse. Though much of the build-up to the ending would--again--be too boring and confusing to anyone who doesn't understand finance, the world's descent into chaos at the end is quite visually enthralling and might make an excellent tool for any economics professor to get students to pay attention in his class.

Of course, recent events also enhance this film's reputation for harrowing realism; though the clunky 1980s computers and the Cold War politics in this story do antiquate this film somewhat, the financially informed viewer will feel a strong shock of recognition in some of the situations portrayed and the characters' analyses of them. Cronyn's speech to Kristofferson near the end of the film could have been ripped straight from some of this decade's economic newsletters and TV talk shows.

In short, this film's not being a huge success at the box office is understandable, but it's a good solid effort at introducing the viewer to our economy and its many philosophical benefits and pitfalls.",1261699200,6,2837,5.027659574468085
293396,4,6300271838,"I recall very well when this movie came out, as well as seeing it on a date while in College. My date sort of liked it, but she did not take it very seriously. Even back then I disliked Hanoi Jane (this was a year or two after she refused to criticize Vietnam, etc. for something even Joan Baez came out against (!), and I had heckled her when she came to campus. Great choice of a speaker Emory!), but I had to admit she was a great actress. Back to the film. Unlike my date, the idea of the movie stuck with me. Apparently, about everyone else in the U.S. thought the movie was totally implausible, and it bombed for several reasons. For instance, it has some goofy scenes that definitely could have been cut, like all of Pakula's films. However, this movie was far ahead of its time.

International Jewish Conspiracy?? Don't think so nutheads. It is the Arabs who control oil, and starting in the 1980's and especially in the 1990's, hiring all the D.C. law firms to ""lobby"" (i.e., ""bribe"") for them  (including, unfortunately, many Jewish attorneys). Then, NOW, it is our buddies the Chinese who have followed suit. The Chinese started behind the scenes in the 90's (with the Clintons' help), and now, 2009 (almost 2010) hold a huge amount of our debt, sell us a huge amount of ""goods"", buy almost nothing from us (though, they do smoke a H-ll of a lot of cigarettes), and have been buying up gold, silver, palladium & platinum.

What the Chinese are doing now, is what Rollover is all about. What seemed implausible to ""mighty America"" in 1981, is not so implausibe right now. Not after the U.S. had to basically convert to a Socialist economy to prevent a world wide economic collapse.

So watch the movie, try to ignore the goofy scenes,and take in the good acting and what has moved from a ridiculous conspiracy theory, to a very plausible scenario.",1259193600,5,1857,4.534328358208955

Swap Asians for Arabs and cheap goods for oil and you are all set.  Almost half of all U.S. debt is owned by foreign investors now, including many that are not friendly to us.  It is in their interest not to dump this debt on the market at the moment but what if bonds or the dollar (or both) started to seriously slide?  What if they decided it was ""them or us"" and weren't going to see their investments implode.  Watch the movie and see how an innocent action might trigger such a response.

293414,4,6300271838,"For me, this is one of Kris Kristofferson's better movies. He plays a bank examiner that finds that one of the bank's Middle East accounts is siphoning off 5% of funds from maturing commercial paper (CP) into gold rather than reinvesting (or rolling over, thus the name of the movie) the proceeds back into more CP issued by the bank. The plot of the movie is finding out why. While some may be turned off by a financially oriented movie, it is scary in the sense that ""Jaws"" was: it's plausible that it could happen (investors buy gold). What we hope doesn't occur in real life is what is portrayed at the end of this movie (it's highly unlikely that it would occur, but then Long Term Capital Management, with two Nobel prize winners on board, wasn't supposed to implode either). And with China holding around one trillion dollars in U.S. Government bonds, this movie is surprising relevant in 2009 as it was when made in 1981. It's suspenseful, but non-financial type people should rent this rather than buy it (one viewing is good enough).

293415,1,6300271838,"This is the film that could easily have tanked the career of lesser mortals, but the mighty Jane Fonda continued acting in six or seven subsequent films until 1992, when she married Ted Turner and her film career ended rather abruptly.  Kris Kristofferson is simply awful/laugable in his role as a Wall Street Troubleshooter.

Don't look for this mess to be released on dvd anytime soon, unless it becomes a camp favorite.  This film tries to be a potboiler, but it ends up being a soap opera with the world economy as a backdrop. It's one establishing shot after another, and the actual consequences of any actual conflict are too abstract for anyone to care about.  Fonda and Kristofferson must have been embarrassed at this thing.  It's just a sheer waste of two good actors.

The plotline is so paper thin that even a kid in second grade would find it to be implausible.  In fact, here's a script for a story that I wrote in about three minutes, which would have made more sense:

""Heroes of the Stratosphere""
by Rance McPance

After taxiing down an airport runway near San Clemente, California, Jane Fonda and Kris Kristofferson take off in a badly-maintained twin engine biplane with Jane Fonda piloting.  At 6,000 feet, Jane decides to put the plane through its paces, and begins performing aerial stunts like barrel rolls and steep power dives.  Unfortunately, the airplane is not in very good shape and after about ten minutes, part of the left wing flies off.

""Hey!,"" yells Kristofferson.
""Hey, Yourself!,"" yells Fonda, coyly.
""Yow!,"" replies Kristofferson.

At that point, Fonda manuevers the biplane into a tailspin, and Kristofferson flies out of his seat, into the air and begins to fall to earth without a parachute.  Then, in an attempt to save Kristofferson by scooping him into the navigator's seat, Fonda puts the plane into a steep dive but is unable to rescue the hapless Kris because of the damaged left wing. Fonda ends up crashing the airplane into a Lake near the DuPont estate near Wilmington, Delaware about a half an hour after takeoff.

Somehow, both Kris and Jane emerge from the experience unscathed.  Later on the two are reunited and they get married and live happily ever after.

The End",1097798400,6,2222,4.8052631578947365
293416,3,6300271838,"Much like the film Kristofferson made previously, ""Heaven's Gate"", this film is not as bad as it's reputation makes it out to be.

Also appearing is a fine set of supporting players, from Josef Sommer to Hume Cronyn.  The technology is dated, but the idea is somewhat timely.  What if the Arabs decided to pull their money out of circulation and put it ""under the mattress""?  There are some tense moments and some 70's era paranoia.  (Much like ""All the President's Men"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", mistrust of the government is a common thread)  This is a movie with flaws, but if you are a Kristofferson fan, you will enjoy yet another intriguing performance.  If you are tired of the teen movies that plague the multiplexes weekly, try this out and enjoy an adult drama.",1083715200,19,983,4.603448275862069

October 8, 2017

When Jane Fonda inherits her murdered husbands stock shares in his financial company, she gets entangled in a dangerous international scheme. She also falls for banker Kris Kristofferson, so thats a nice bonus.

Ill be honest: I had no idea what was going on during most of this movie. Its very heavy on the financial talk, so if you don't speak Wall Street, youll probably be just as lost as I was. Kris, Jane, Hume Cronyn, Josef Sommer, and Bob Guntonin his first filmare all involved in this financial thriller, and for those of you who can follow the plot, itll be a nail-biter until the very end. For me, it was a snooze-fest until the very end, at which time I was very grateful. The only parts of the movie that stood out to me were some pretty outfits Jane Fonda wore and Macon McCalmans very convincing acting in a scene where he expresses his fear for his life.",1507420800,,908,4.463855421686747

7808215,4,6300271838,We are in a position where this kind of financial collapse is a real possibility.  It was made quite a while ago so don't laugh when they mention the dollar amounts involved - it would be many multiples of those figures now.  I enjoy catastrophe movies sometimes - this is just a different kind of castrophe than most movies.  Also check out The Big Short for an eye-opener financial movie.,1480636800,,390,4.542857142857143
7808216,4,6300271838,"This was a very interesting movie and I have heard and read that this movie was advanced notice (by TPTB) of what will happen when Saudi Arabia dumps all of it's U.S. Treasury Bills.  It will collapse our economy in a cataclysmic way.  And guess what?  The Saudis having been dumping treasuries by the boat loads recently.  As far as the cinematics - I LOVE the 70's stuff.  I grew up in the 70's and it was a trip back in time looking at all the office business machines, cars and clothing. I thought the acting was pretty good too.",1478044800,2,533,4.29

7808218,3,6300271838,"My only real issue with this movie, which I saw on cable way back when it came out, is that it is so dated.  I've always been a big Fonda fan, and Kristofferson does a nice job here, too, as do the supporting cast, with a special shout out to Hume Cronyn.  Lots of beautiful interiors, along with suitably menacing location shots of Manhattan by night (this was long before the Disney-fication of NYC by successive corporate mayors).  The plot is a typical one for the period, i.e. the Saudis destroy the economy of the USA by pulling all their petrodollars out of U.S. banks.  Today the plot would be largely the same, with the substitution of the Chinese for the Saudis.  Or perhaps subprime mortgage lenders would be the culprits. It doesn't matter.  This movie puts on a good game for a long while, but when you hear one trader yell ""they're rolling over NINETY MILLION!"" as if it was all the money in the world, I think you'll have a hard time not laughing out loud.",1467763200,,971,4.426966292134831
7808219,2,6300271838,"Was not overly expressed with this movie. The story was just passable. Jane Fonda (an excellent actor) did not seem comfortable in this role. Kris Kristofferson's role also, was not suitable for him. Not so good movie, that wasted talents, Fonda and Kristofferson.",1465948800,,264,5.162790697674419
