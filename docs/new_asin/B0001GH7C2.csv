1998273,3,B0001GH7C2,"Utah, 1945 film

It starts with hundreds of cattle in the background. The Majestic Theatre shows a New Musical Extravaganza. Dorothy sings. But their backer has backed out. [Its a business deal.] Can they raise $25,000 to put on the show? Dorothy sends a telegram to her ranch. Can she sell the ranch? Roy offers advice to Gabby. [Notice no sidearms.] There is an offer for the ranch. Can the broker buy low and sell high? Nice shooting, Lacey! There is a chase for action. Gabby lassoes his prey. Let them walk back to town. A steam locomotive arrives at Coldbrook. One big happy family? Miss Bryant has friends. She plans to sell a going business to invest in a speculative business! The station wagon stops. The other cowboys sing for the girls. There is a plan to discourage a sale. Will they be frightened by wild animals?

Those two men approach Gabbys place and talk to Dorothy about a sale. Look what theyve done to this place says Gabby. There are humorous conversations. Dorothy wants to go into town. [How long can they keep up this deception?] Roy talks about the history of the first settlers. Can Miss Wanda learn more from Bob? Will Dorothy sell the ranch for a low amount? Yes1 [Know the value of any item by getting independent estimates from others.] There is a song to welcome the girls. But they left! Why? Roy learns there are riders on the south range, they race to investigate. [Long shots suggest the use of doubles.] Bowman bought the ranch and is rounding up the cattle for sale. Rustlers, lets go get them! They don't have air like this in Chicago. The Sheriff verified the sale. [This is the penalty for passing off Gabbys place as the Bar-X! Honesty is still the best policy.]

Roy and Gabby are arrested and put in jail! Bowman and Lacey are taking the cattle to Chicago. Can Roy and Gabby break jail? Yes. [What kind of example is Roy setting for his fans?] The Herefords are loaded into cattle cars. Now the Sheriff and his men are after Roy and Gabby. The train moves out. They show the stockyards of Chicago. The count checks. Roy fights with Bowman then pursues him. Gabby gets Lacey. Trigger helps too. The police arrive to take them all in. The Sheriff tells Roy about the fraud, the check wasn't good. What about his arthritis? The check for the cattle will be given to Dorothy. Bowman and Lacey will be held for the Utah Sheriff.

This is an entertaining drama with music and comedy. We see a rehearsal to entertain the audience. We see the sheepherders too! Then dancing girls. It must be a satire or parody on the usual Western with Roy deceiving Dorothy. Were there any other movies where Roy and Gabby are jail breakers? Everything is properly resolved at the end of this comedy. The famous Chicago stockyards  would later be closed down so the processing is done closer to the source. Its cost-effective. I wonder what the air was like back of the yards? Sheep provide a renewable resource (wool) unlike the hides of cattle. Sheep also require a lower capital investment; they can be herded with dogs rather than humans. [This puts cowboys out of work due to outsourcing.]",1411516800,,3116,4.587073608617594
1998294,4,B0001GH7C2,"Yeah, 4 star, because I rate according to the genre, and this, to me, is a standout in the genre of B-movie singing cowboy pseudo-westerns.  Yeah, the storyline was contrived, but it was well acted, sometimes emotionally touching - who'd a thunk of an ""Old Yeller"" moment in a Horse Opera.",1409443200,,289,4.666666666666667

1998315,1,B0001GH7C2,"The film itself was great.  Good songs, and an engaging story about how Roy was wrongly accused about killing a competitor's horse.

The film transfer was terrible.  It was originally shot in pre-widescreen 1.33:1 aspect ratio.
The producers of this DVD couldn't leave well enough alone.  They had to stretch the image
to a more ""modern"" 1.85:1 aspect ratio, which
DISTORTED THE IMAGE.  Roy looked like he
weighed 250 pounds, because when you
expand a standard ratio image, everyone
loses height and gets wider.  I know what I am talking about, because I was a former film projectionist.

This is truly a trashy transfer and will only make a good beer coaster, since it is good for nothing else.  DO NOT BUY FROM ALPHA VIDEO UNLESS YOU ENJOY WASTING YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!

Look for a proper transfer of this film elsewhere.

If this is what Alpha Video is doing with their DVD'S, I will never buy from them again.",1381276800,,915,4.6625
1998316,1,B0001GH7C2,"If your are looking for a quality print of this great Roy Rogers' film, this is not the one!  It is a DVD-r and the beginning opening scene is gone, no credits and music over the same repeated  intro which for a recent release is garbage. The copy I purchased from Amazon skipped and I could not get past the 1st 2 minutes of the film!  I have had several copies.  The Alpha video print is IS A PRESSED PRINT AND THE QUALITY IS PRETTY GOOD for what they have put out in the past.  The best print of this film I have seen is on ""The Great American Western"" series from Platinum. There are several other films on the same disc which are't  of the best quality, but this one is! Hope you can find an original release - because I am not sure the same quality is there on Echo Bridge.",1379289600,,779,4.0588235294117645

1998322,4,B0001GH7C2,"You'd expect a film titled ""My Pal Trigger"" to be a maudlin mess. It's anything but. Both the plot and the characters have a degree of complexity you'd expect in an adult film. Roy Rogers, in particular, is not always ""Mr Nice Guy"". He is, at times, an arrogant law-breaker.

Definitely recommended for at least one viewing.

A qualification... If Amazon had a proper rating system, I'd give this film 2.5 out of 4 stars. I've given it 4 out of 5 because 3 stars is a negative review, which this film doesn't deserve.

PS: For those who didn't know... Trigger (then known as Golden Cloud) was the horse Olivia de Havilland rode in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"".",1352073600,,662,4.546218487394958
1998323,5,B0001GH7C2,"I just loved this movie. Old Roy was such a great actor and singer. If he was alive he would be one hundred years old. I also loved Trigger. He was such a fine horse. I found this movie: fun, interesting, exciting, and full of adventure.",1345334400,,237,4.173913043478261
1998344,4,B0001GH7C2,"There is a scene in this film that shows a different kind of Roy Rogers than the one in the distant past that I kind of recall:
Roy's horse ""Lady"" is trying to protect its colt ""Trigger"" from a mountain Lion and sustains a terrible wounding Roy has to reach for his gun but cannot fire, he needs to turn his back to ""Lady""
momentarily and then in one motion turn and fire.
""Its just like I told you ""Trigger"" sometimes its fun sometimes its tough,
your've got to take the breaks the way they come
life is sort of like gambling
you can't always win"".
I do not expect many people around today to appreciate a program such as this,
I understand ""My Pal Trigger"" was made in 1946 and I was not around until 1951 and in Australia, however it strikes a cord with me.
Much of television produced today I cannot stomach.",1332115200,,812,4.245161290322581
1998345,5,B0001GH7C2,"When i was growing up, i loved all of roy's movies, i could not get Enough of them. This movie, my pal trigger stuck to me like glue. except the name i forgot,I just could not remember it. So just before Roy left us he sold a lot of his horse's and i went there and met him for the first time. He was tired and came over where i was sitting down. We had a long talk, and i loved it. That was when i ask him about the movie,when he first got trigger,He said he liked all of his movies, but that was a special one of His. He said that one stands out for him too.",1329868800,,560,3.7142857142857144

1998347,5,B0001GH7C2,"This is by far the best Roy Rogers film ever made and Roy's own personal favorite. It covers the period of about three years and tells the story of how Trigger came to be. Heartfelt and emotional, not a standard shoot 'em up, but a simple, poetic story of a man and his horse. The acting is outstanding all 'round with an especially good performance by ""Gabby"" Hayes as a man consumed with hatred of Roy because he thinks Roy is responsible for the death of his great horse, The Golden Sovereign. Jack Holt and Roy Barcroft are the bad guys and Dale Evans and the Sons of the Pioneers round out an exceptional cast. A fine film, an A+ B Western...And the ALPHA dvd is of highest quality, a remarkable transfer, crisp and clean image. Most highly recommended!",1261094400,,758,4.460431654676259

1998364,5,B0001GH7C2,THIS WAS PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND WHO IS A ROY ROGERS FAN.  SHE JUST RAVED ABOUT THE MOVIE AND HOW MUCH IT BROUGHT HER BACK TO HER CHILDHOOD.,1168300800,,149,3.806451612903226
1998365,5,B0001GH7C2,"I take issue with the negative review on this movie. I found it a two-hanky movie (for anyone who loves animals), some real acting from ""Gabby"" (who seldom, if ever, played a drunk) and even a surprise ending. Jack Holt is excellent as the heavy, and Roy is far from the usual super-cowboy character in this. (The ""California"" character mentioned in another review was played by Andy Clyde, and I don't think he ever appeared in a Rogers movie -- mainly in the Hopalong Cassidy and Whip Wilson series.) This is one of two movie versions of how Roy got Trigger, but much the better one.",1119657600,,585,4.528301886792453
1998366,3,B0001GH7C2,"Dale Evans is the singer of an all girl band. She goes to Utah to sell her grandfather's ranch, that way her band will have money to put on their show. Only Roy isn't pleased with this, so he lies to her about its location. Add Gabby Hayes, romance, and some bad guys and this is an enjoyable Roy Rogers movie. Dale is very cute in this movie and she has a few solo numbers. The only thing that doesn't seem quite right with this movie is the change of her hair from brunette to blonde with no explanation.",1084233600,,506,4.121212121212121

8012238,5,B0001GH7C2,"""Utah"", one of my favorite Roy Rogers & Dale Evans movies along with Gabby Hayes and the Sons of the Pioneers.  There are others that have a little more humor, but the movies before Roy & Dale were married show their humorous side. Dale was a class act, smart, helpful a spitfire who stood up for herself. And Roy the great guy, the hero who was not above teasing Dale, playing jokes to get her riled, these two were meant to be together.
Always great harmonies from the Sons of the Pioneers.

This b&w movie has a menu and beginning credits, seems to last a bit over 77 minutes, uncut except for no closing credits.
The 5 stars are for the movie itself, it is the same Alpha release shown in the product photo (same as on the case).  The DVD seems to show the movie a tad dark, like the brightness/contrast is off, but it is watchable.  I adjusted my TV after a good way into the movie, seemed to help, guessing the age of the source of this copy has a similar quality.  I am just glad to have this on DVD. Their movies were before my time but we enjoyed watching these when we were growing up,
It may not be ""perfect"" compared to today's movies on dvd but Roy & Dale's fans will be glad to have this in their collection.",1489363200,,1222,4.182978723404255
