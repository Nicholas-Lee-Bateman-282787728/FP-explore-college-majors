8562477,5,B00B4RYS7E,"If you want to see and hear what happened in the world in year 1944, you find it in this DVD. It makes a hilarious movie experience and a great gift to anyone with a tie (such as a birthday) to 1944. It gives you a cross-sectional view of history, including lifestyle, entertainment, news (in politics and war), and sports, reported by 1944 media. I loved to watch this DVD and will show it to my children who are interested in history, but have never looked specifically at year 1944.",1397433600,,485,4.4
