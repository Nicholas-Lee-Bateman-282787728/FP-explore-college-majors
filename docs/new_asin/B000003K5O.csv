7903075,5,B000003K5O,"Lwaxana Troi is again visiting the Enterprise, having spent time helping the Cairn, a race that is exclusively telepathic, learn how to communicate verbally to prepare for meetings with Federation officials.  Lwaxana is trying to set up Deanna with Maques, one of the Cairn delegate, a widower with a young daughter (played by Kirsten Dunst).  After a conversation with the young girl, Lwaxana falls into a coma.  Maques tells Deanna that her mother had some sort of psychic trauma in the past that has forced her to retreat into her mind.  Deanna makes telepathic contact with her mother, but Lwaxana piteously begs to be left along, sending images of a wolf, Picard and Deanna's father to chase her away.  Going through her mother's journals for a clue as to what could have happened in the past, Deanna discovers a seven-year gap, covering the period from Lwaxana's marriage until shortly after Deanna was born.  Going back into her mother's mind, Deanna uncovers the shocking truth.
This is far and away the most memorable of the Lwaxana Troi episodes, showing that Majel Barrett is as adept at doing dramatic scenes as she is at doing comedy.  Marina Sirtis also shines, especially in the shattering conclusion and its aftermath.  What impressed me the most is how they took Lwaxana's use of the pet name ""Little One,"" and gave it such emotional significance.  It is one of the most emotional sequences in the show's history, made all the more powerful because it is so unexpected.  For my money, ""Dark Page"" is the biggest tearjerker in the history of STNG.",986947200,2,1563,4.8641509433962264
