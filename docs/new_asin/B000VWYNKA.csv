8220384,5,B000VWYNKA,"I like all of the braincandy series because my kids like them. They watch them and then, at the end, they get up and start dancing. They like the music and imitating the big kids. Since the music is contemporary, I like it too. I also appreciate the diversity of the children in the series. Braincandy stands up to repeat viewings. I can personally vouch for that!",1193788800,3,364,4.447761194029851
8220385,5,B000VWYNKA,"I'm a huge fan and owner of the entire Braincandy series, but what struck me about Hear My World was the really authentic way the puppets and kids interact to bring the message to life. The focus on sounds that my toddler hears every day made it really practical and easy for me to see how I could be demonstating this same type of sound 'experiment'. Really smart content.",1193702400,2,373,4.420289855072464
8220386,5,B000VWYNKA,"We've been fans of Braincandy from early on - our daughter loves the characters and the music. What differentiates Braincandy from other videos is that it is so gentle and yet engaging... while other videos can either zonk out your kid or hyper-stimulate them, we've found that Braincandy keeps our daughter's attention without stirring her up. She often talks back to the characters or sings along.

The new titles are just as good as the originals. It's fun to see how each sense is brought to life. Enjoy!",1193702400,,508,4.7727272727272725
