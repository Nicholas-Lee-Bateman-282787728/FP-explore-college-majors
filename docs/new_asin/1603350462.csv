Extremely poor quality: the speaker's lips are not synchronized with the audio, the text at to bottom of the screen is missing the lower half and it scrolls by too quickly. The presentation is unprofessional, and monotone. It has the look of a bad video chat. This is just the first disk. The second DVD will not play at all. ""Disc Error"" is all I get. I am so disappointed. Save your money.",1313625600,3,440,4.378048780487805
7800175,1,1603350462,"I was very disappointed with the product. And shocked the Amazon would risk its reputation by selling this product. The entire content was lecture read (with a heavy accent) with no dynamics, no visuals, no case presentations.  In short, it was a cheap 1-man production. You get better material for free at youtube.",1303689600,3,315,4.943396226415095
