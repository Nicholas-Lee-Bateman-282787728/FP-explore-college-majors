8525308,4,B0085A9KM6,Wow! Quite a movie. A film about a group of stuntmen and the stunts are impressive.  William Boyd and the whole cast which includes Lon Chaney Jr and in an uncredited cameo Marion Byron are good. What really is chilling is a scene where a depressed Dorthy Wilson sits staring out a bar window at the Hollywood sign in the distance. She then attempts to jump out the window but is stopped by Boyd. This film came out just a couple of months after Peg Entwistle did jump off the Hollywood sign to her death. One has to wonder if this scene was added after that incident. Very spooky. Very good film.,1488153600,,597,4.330357142857143
