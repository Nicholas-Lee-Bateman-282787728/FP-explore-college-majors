6253196,4,B00I83WKTA,"Boxing instructor and prune juice junkie Frank (Danny Trejo) teams up with high sticking curmudgeon Bernie (Danny Glover) to avenge the death of a young drug dealing boxer. The plot is predictable. The film is filled with cliches and corny humor poking fun at old men.

This is  a fun comedy/action film. Where else are you going to see Trejo playing Barbies?

Bad Ass 3 is in post production and should be out in 2015.

6253197,3,B00I83WKTA,"""I know who you are Mr. Vega. What happened to you on that bus was no accident. You were meant to do good in a city that needs it."" Frank Vega (Trejo) has become a local celebrity as well as a law enforcement deputy after his dealing with thugs on a bus. He tries to live a quiet life and splits his time between training young boxers and visiting his friend Bernie (Glover). When one of the most promising young men he was training ends up dead in a drug related murder his mother asks Frank to help. When the police aren't doing enough it is once again up to him to clean up the city, but this time he has help. There are two types of movies Hollywood does now...re-makes and sequels rather the original needs one or not. This is a perfect example of a movie that didn't need a sequel. The first one was OK but when it ended I didn't think, I wish I knew what happened to him next. This is just another movie with Danny Trejo playing Danny Trejo, I do like him but he doesn't need to be in 90 movies a year. Overall, this is really a movie made for people who liked the first one and fans of Danny Trejo, everyone else may or may not enjoy it. I thought it wasn't needed. I give this a C+.",1396656000,,1191,4.029535864978903
6253198,1,B00I83WKTA,"I AM SO SORRY! I really wanted to like this movie, but it was horrible. The first one was great, and it didn't even

6253245,3,B00I83WKTA,"This movie worked for me as a typical ""Buddy Flick"" with Trejo and Glover sharing the spotlight.  In typical Trejo Bad Ass fashion someone's heinie needs a serious kicking and he feels the need to step up.

Trejo isn't known for his ability to act but he does manage to make you like him in spite of it all.  Glover steps out of his comfort zone in more ways than one.  He doesn't often play a second fiddle/back up guy (unless you count Mel Gibson's films).  His character also steps out of his comfort zone when Trejo's character is taking a beating.  The stick work was awesome, actually. The stunt work rocked in this scene.

It's a given the two work well together.  From what is said, Trejo is well respected in Fantasyland and Glover has oodles of aos experience.  The story line is lame but the characters are lovable.",1476230400,2,826,4.453333333333333

I have watched other movies that these guys have been in and both were always in some sort of action flick.  I got no less in this movie.  I'm glad I did watch it.  It was funny at times, and most of all entertaining.  I know that Danny Trejo is not a trained actor but he is no less an actor because of it. He plays in movies that he fits into and stays in it without being fully stereotyped.

Danny Glover is has been around for quite sometime and is a trained actor.  He is very funny in a different way always giving that serious deadpan but funny feeling.

Both of these guys together in the this movie was a good mix.  They brought the point of the movie too you and made you get the feeling of wanting to be involved or a part of the movie.

But that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch.  This time round Danny Glover joins in the fun alongside DannyTrejo.  As you would expect this film again revolves around someone special to Frank (Trejo's character) being murdered.  This one sort of pays homage to Glover's most popular role too (Lethal Weapon 2) in that he constantly refers to himself as being old (although he doesn't use the line) and the bad guy is someone with diplomatic immunity.  Although I didn't recongnise many of the other actors, it was interesting to see Victorious'  Leon Thomas III (Andre in that show) in a completely different role, even if he didn't have a lot of screen time.

This isn't the best movie in the world, but I don't think it is seriously trying to be that. Like the original it is a lot of fun.",1451260800,,981,4.635838150289017

6253434,4,B00I83WKTA,"Bad Asses or Bad Ass 2(released Mar/14)stars,among others,Danny Trejo,Danny Glover,Andrew Divoff and Jacqueline Obradors. Sequels generally do not fare as well as originals,but I am happy to report that this film comes up to the original in just about every respect.
The story finds our ""bad ass"" Trejo now living out of a gym. He has had to sell his mom's house in order to pay for cancer surgery for his beloved retriever. Next door to the gym is a mom and pop store run by a curmudgeonly old Glover. The two have a rough and gruff relationship but get along despite themselves. Trejo helps to train and mentor some of the young tough L.A. kids who come into his gym. He is particularly close to one. One night the young man gets himself killed. His policeman friend tells Trejo that the kid was carrying thousands of dollars of drugs on him. Trejo vows to find out the men responsible, for the young man's mother's sake,whom he becomes close to. It takes Trejo following a friend of his the next night, to find out the source. It seems they were both earning extra cash by selling prescription drugs on the street. Trejo barges into the apartment and proceeds to shut down the distribution centre.
Trjejo's actions get the attention of those in charge. It seems the man who runs it is the son to the ambassador to the Argentinian consulate. The ambassador in turn is the one smuggling drugs into the country to sell. The son,at his father's behest,tries to put a lid on Trejo. Just when Trejo is down for the count and ready to be eliminated, Glover steps in and takes the group out with some  well placed whacks with a hockey stick. Glover it seems had been set to be the first black hockey player in the NHL years before,but had been severely injured before he reached the majors,thus losing out on a lucrative career. We also learn that Glover has a severe liver disease and is not expected to live for more than a few months. Despite this Glover and Trejo team up to try and take down this insidious group of drug peddlers.
Trejo and Glover make a step by step progression,going from one incident to another in their climb to find first,the ambassadors son,then to get the ambassador himself. Glover and Trejo even get their store and gym,respectively,blown up, but this does not deter the two. They first get to the son, and during an altercation Trejo learns where his father is going to be and actually gets him arrested. But diplomatic immunity has its privileges and he walks free. This puts Trejos on the ambassadors personal radar,but Trejo and Glover continue their fight.
The two decide to infiltrate a meat packing plant the ambassador runs. They indeed finds drugs hidden amongst the meat. However they are caught and they end up hung high within a meat locker. They are left to freeze,but the two,as resourceful as ever,eventually escape. At this time a wrench falls into the works. The ambassador kidnaps his lady friend. This empowers the two to go on to find and get the ambassadors son through a chase in the wilderness. They finally get him after some hairy moments and they arrange a swap with his father.
Back in the city they meet at a heli-pad and the exchange is made. However the ambassador tries to take out the two with a hidden gunman in the back of his truck. Glover drops him with his pistol. Trejo starts mopping the floor with the ambassador when the ambassador's posse shows up surrounding the two. However the fight continues with Trejo still beating his butt. Just then the police arrive to take control of the entire scene. This time the ambassador and his drug selling days are over. The film comes to an end as Trejo is relaxing at the home of his now-lady friend,who would like him to stay with her and her daughter permanently.
The story and feel of the film,its direction and good acting is on the same level as the first one. Now with Glover aboard,the film takes on a slightly different dynamic, as there are more humourous moments between the two throughout the film. Some funny ones come just as Trejo is trying to get cozy with his lady and Glover""intervenes"".But when the action starts and things get down and dirty,Glover's character is right there and in the thick of things as well as Trejo's. There is great chemistry between the two and it doesn't detract from the over raison d'etre of the movie. All the other actors involved do a fine job also.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. The only extra is a featurette on the films making.
Overall, another success in the Bad ass franchise(I understand there is another coming in 2015).Trejo and Glover work wonderfully together. This one has a bit more humour in it than the first, but it doesn't detract at all from the over all dynamic. It's different...but in a good way. Four solid stars.",1423094400,,4842,4.604166666666667

6253438,3,B00I83WKTA,"Bad Ass 2: Bad Asses (Craig Moss, 2014)

It is a foregone conclusion, given Hollywood economics these days, that when one finds oneself with a surprise hit on one's hands, one must make a sequel. Bad Ass was the very definition of a surprise hit; Moss' 2012 basement-budget Danny Trejo vehicle became a bona fide smash on video. This, Bad Ass 2: Bad Asses was in the cards almost immediately, and who better to join Trejo as a geriatric vigilante than Detective Murtaugh himself? I do have to give Moss credit for not having Danny Glover use Murtaugh's I'm too old for this s*** tagline, at least.

Plot: Frank Vega (Trejo, reprising his role) is revelling in his newfound fame, but it hasn't really changed him all that much; he's still Frankie from the Block, after all, and that includes trips to the local convenience store, run by cantankerous agoraphobic Bernie Pope (Glover), with lots of barb-trading involved. Manny Parks (Constantine's Jeremy Ray Valdez), one of Vega's proteges, winds up dead, and there's a rumor that drugs are involved. When Vega starts investigating and there's some pushback, Pope comes to his aid one night, and the two end up hunting for the source of the neighborhood's drug problemwhich turns out to be much more problematic than they first thought.

The safest, and yet least satisfying, route to take with a sequel is let's take the things that worked from the first movie and amp them way up. Invariably, the end result is a series of disconnected scenes that pay lip service to the original film without any of the atmosphere that made it worth watching. Bad Ass 2 is not that bad. (Without mentioning any recent horrible sequels that fit the description, Bad Ass 2 won't give you a... hangover...) But it does emphasize things about the original, and adding Danny Glover as, basically, a mirror image of Danny Trejo triple-underlines that. There is a plot here, however much it may be lifted from one of the Lethal Weapon movies (telling you which would spoil the mechanism that allows the crooks to act as they do) and however thin a veneer over the two guys wisecracking and hitting people it may be. The upside to this is that if you liked the first one, you will find a good deal of what you liked about the first one here; it's got the same basement-budget feel with the same surprising level of talent in the cast (everyone must have worked for scale), a lot of one-liners that will make you feel vaguely uncomfortable, and a few moments of explicit, shocking violence, though none of them were as squirm-inducing (to me personally, anyway) as the Dispos-All scene in the first one. The downside, well, Moss went with the tried-and-true formula instead of trying to push a few sides of the envelope to see what the formula could get away with, and the end result, while a fun, enjoyable movie, is vaguely dissatisfying because of it. ** ",1415836800,,2884,4.716269841269841

6253442,5,B00I83WKTA,"I enjoyed the original ""Bad Ass"" movie, so I looked forward to this sequel when I heard about its release. The sequel has the good idea of giving the lead character an equally old and grumpy partner, and the two Danny's (Trejo and Glover) playing the leads manage to generate some great chemistry. It also helps that their characters have been written to be very likable not just together, but apart. The movie has generally good production values and moves from scene to scene fairly quickly, so there are no boring parts. Don't get me wrong, this movie is not perfect. The movie cheapens out at one point by extensively using footage from the 1990 movie ""Narrow Margin"". Also, the movie's mix of yuk-yuk comedy with hard violence does give the movie an inconsistent (and weird) feeling at times. Fortunately, there's more good stuff than disappointing material here.

This however, is an absolute piece of junk. It's a product of laziness and falls well below standard direct to home video fair. I saw the trailer, and was really hoping for a good time. There was a shot of Danny Glover in a green tracksuit and Danny Trejo with a fannypack walking in slow motion, and it had me sold on the movie. All it had to do was have more of that with some good jokes and I'd have had a good old time.

But this turned out to be The Expendables for the under 70 IQ. No actually, that's insulting to them. Even they wouldn't enjoy it. It's not funny. It's not exciting.

It helped this movie had a decent story line too. I felt like the first movie, the actual story part fell flat, but not this one.
I thought I liked Danny Glover before, but believe me, I'm a bigger fan now. His character took me by surprise. And Danny Trejo has been a fave of mine since the first time I saw his act. He's part of the reason I watched this series.

It's the same genre as the old ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""48 Hours"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movies - except with the updated humor and sophistication of the best of Schwarzenegger et al. Light, nonstop, hilarious, action-packed, irreverent, violent, fun. The banter is perfect between Glover and Trejo - and I hope ""the Dannys"" make a few sequels together. It would only work together. The chemistry is a crucial component of why this works. (Such as when Glover calls Trejo a ""damn Mexican MacGuyver"" after they make an escape.) Watch it expecting nothing more or less than popcorn-munching fun, and you'll enjoy it the way it's meant to be enjoyed.

I've adored Mr. Glover for years and really enjoyed all of his performances in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies and everywhere else I could find him. Although I have no idea how old Mr. Glover is, I know that Mr. Trejo is almost 70.  I would never have guessed it.  Although Mr. Trejo tried to look like an aging boxer, a glimpse at his massive back and shoulder muscles in his thong backed tank top at the beginning of the movie tells the truth(Thank you, producers and directors, for that scene!). He also sported an impressive beard which is about the only way possible to make him look old--was it natural or make up?  Mr. Glover has one of those adorable faces that you just can't resist and both of these wonderful gents are very lovable in this movie. I loved the scene where they dressed for their adventure in crime fighting and each has a closet full of identical sets of clothing. I also loved that they took public transportation--taxi's and buses.  I loved the scene with Lonnie love in the property department of the police station. I loved the scene in the college dorm where Mr. Glover impresses the cute college co-ed who is pretty much naked, and I always love that the Dannies ended up with the girls. The movie is a playful romp through Los Angeles (one of the arch baddies talks about the pacific coast highway (PCH)) with the Dannies laying waste to all of the drug smuggling bad guys in pursuit of a murderer, a diplomat with immunity to everything, even to good taste and intelligence it seems.
