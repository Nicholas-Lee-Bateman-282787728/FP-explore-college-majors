8344860,4,B001US0P7E,"Whether or not you're a fan of Peter Sellers' body of work, there's little point in arguing against his skills as a chameleonic actor/impersonator and brilliant improvisational comic, and documentarian Tony Palmer's fascinating, intentionally obscure snapshot of the once-giant talent (here, ca. 1969, prematurely past his prime) will give no fodder to Sellers' detractors.  Sellers, throughout the fractured, off-the-cuff clips that make up 'The World of Peter Sellers,' is as funny, irreverent and disarmingly unpredictable as any character he ever embodied.  As his legacy on radio, television and film attests, he was a craftsman attuned so acutely to the fickle tastes and attitudes of the popular culture of his day-- from the post-war English malaise to the inception of rock-n-roll to the sexual revolution-- while effortlessly harnessing the timing and stylings of the world's top classic comedians, that the only limits to his success seemed to be those imposed by his bedeviling penchant for self-destruction.

As public opinion of Sellers the man then (as now) varied widely, Palmer's frenetic and often disjointed documentary smartly makes no attempt to explore and catalog its subject's personal or professional history (the photo collages splashed across the exterior and interior of the DVD cover belie the film's content), instead allowing Sellers' mercurial personality to frame the narrative (save a few interspersed minutes of commentary by Sellers' 'Goon Show' colleague and foul-weather friend Spike Milligan).  In this way TWOPS serves as a metaphor for the walking paradox that Sellers was (in fact, parts seem so thrown together it's more like watching a series of unrelated outtakes from a number of those awkward behind-the-scenes featurettes of actors milling about the set of their latest project, forcing ad-libs for the off-camera cameras at the behest of the studio's PR department): such a mix of vanity and insecurity, exemplified by Sellers' alternating fits of self-conscious extroversion and contrived sincerity, is indeed startling to witness and speaks volumes about both the man and the performer.

Palmer and others, including various biographers, tend toward a preoccupation with Sellers' famous lack of self-identity, which Sellers himself alludes to throughout TWOPS's many extemporaneous 'interview' vignettes, but one almost gets the feeling Sellers is aping this conundrum for perverse pleasure, or perhaps for some other purpose, rather than really buying into it, knowing that in the end his comedic personas, when he chooses to employ them, will create a sufficient smokescreen to his ever truly having to address the issue.  The prevalent idea that Spike Milligan speaks of-- Sellers' 'madness'-- is also on full display here.  But what is clear too is that his madness is derivative more of self-consumption than of genius.  Rarely has an entertainer of such huge ability, instinct, ego and command of his audience (and hence a comensurate potential to control his own destiny) been so blameless for his failures (bad films, bad relationships, etc.)-- for it was evident to most observers, at least at this point in Sellers' career, that he hadn't the discipline to marshall his immense talents, except in short bursts, to maintain the level of success that might have been his.  Perhaps the main failing of Palmer's film, then, is its implied premise that there's order to Sellers' peculiar brand of disorder when in fact what we see is a portrait of a man who affirms with every idiosyncratic pose, voice, and antic that he in no way knows where he is going, a theme which echoed his real life as he gained and squandered fortunes, friends and industry connections with reckless abandon.

So, after veiwing TWOPS, the burning question seems to be: is it a study of a lunatic playing at being a clown, or of a clown playing at being a lunatic?  Palmer's anarchic presentation only reinforces that enigma by indulging for 48 minutes a man whose entire public existence-- and thus whose primary reason for being-- was incubated, synthesized and ultimately compromised by overindulgence.  A unique work, worth watching.  3 1/2 stars.",1330041600,3,4183,5.319696969696969
