8143527,5,B000I2JDE4,I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE VERY MUCH. IT IS GOOD FOR OTHERS TO SEE.,1440547200,,61,3.769230769230769
8143528,5,B000I2JDE4,I related to it completely and I loved the music.  It made me cry.  I called my parents after watching this.  Worth the ride it took me on.  I was even able to get a signed DVD copy and poster with my purchase as well!,1429833600,,218,3.7777777777777777
8143529,1,B000I2JDE4,"I picked this one up for a song at a Going out of business sale, so thank God I wasn't too disappointed. The acting is poor, the script is even worse. I will probably give it to my nephew who is gaga over Korean Chicks.",1269561600,2,219,3.888888888888889
8143530,2,B000I2JDE4,I think the title tells you everything. I couldn't understand what the producers want to say on this movie. It is a collage of unrelated pieces just to fill the two hours of film.,1252368000,2,179,4.294117647058823
8143531,5,B000I2JDE4,"This movie is a must see! I disagree on how it was a struggle to its

expectation. If you understand the movie from your heart instead of the

mind, it's very inspirational. It definitely inspired me and it should

inspire everyone out there. It brought tears to my eyes when a struggle

and wound that seems eternally damaged was still able to heal. If you

miss your chance to watch this movie in theater, don't miss it with

this DVD. Great job to all the cast and crew that made this film

possible! Keep up the good work!",1166745600,4,526,4.3061224489795915
8143532,2,B000I2JDE4,"This is a below average remake of the old indian classic ""Hare Krishna, Hare Rama"" which is much more poignant and adorned with beautiful music as well. Even if you don't know Hindi, get a DVD with English subtitles. It will be worth it. This movie has taken a story which can have a lot more depth and can offer a lot more experiences and turned it into clockwork.",1164931200,,365,4.304347826086956
