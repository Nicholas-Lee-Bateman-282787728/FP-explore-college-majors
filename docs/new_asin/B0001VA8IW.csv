8298729,4,B0001VA8IW,Good instruction for basic of slide guitar. If you already are proficient at slide guitar no need for this product. Good for me as one who waited until retirement to take up hobby of learning acoustic guitar.,1330819200,2,208,4.648648648648648
8298730,3,B0001VA8IW,"Overall, this video should be very useful for guitar players wishing to learn slide techniques.
These techniques were presented clearly, and were easy to follow, even by a complete beginner such as myself.
However, the audio has an annoying background hum, and the video is sometimes slightly out of focus. This is unacceptable in the digital age. I suspect the old VHS format was simply dubbed onto the new DVD format, with a resultant loss of quality.
I rate it 3 out of 5 stars.",1232496000,2,481,4.670588235294118
