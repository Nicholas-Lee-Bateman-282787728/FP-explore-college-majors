2772603,4,B000NO243E,"Silk was a surprisingly good view. It had suspense, horror, and thriller elements. Amongst random thinking-horror elements, that is elements which are horror in that they make your skin crawl just enough, but not horror so much that our girl friends won't want. Thinking enough that you won't just predict what the story will resolve to, yet planned enough that you can try to guess.

I would rate this film amongst such films as Old Boy, with it's explicit direction, yet lack of prediction (the ending isn't completely obvious), and Dark Water or Ringu for it's skin-crawly elements that we all love.

I am happy with this film.",1249430400,2,630,4.824074074074074
2772604,5,B000NO243E,"SILK is a fantastic combination of horror, sci-fi, suspense, tragedy, and some government conspiracy / action-thriller tossed in for added flavor. This is yet another example of asia's inate grasp of all things supernatural and unnerving. The idea of capturing a ghost is interesting enough, but what this movie does w/ that idea is pure genius! I was fascinated and surprised throughout. If you want intriguing terror, and you think that there are no more unusual stories left to be told, then SILK should give you some welcome chills...",1247616000,3,538,5.056179775280899
2772605,4,B000NO243E,"Good movie.  Mis-marketed a bit perhaps... its more of a ghost mystery than a horror or shocker.  Even the music in the movie menus is inappropriate in that regard.  I went into it with the expectation that it was more of a story & less of a shocker (as others have written in their reviews here) and I left happy.

The first 20 minute of the film are a little under refined, leaving you wondering if you actually want to watch it, but it picks up and grabs you pretty well after that.  It has a surprise tear-jerker plot twist at the end, which I thought was atypical for Tartan.

It's different & worth a watch.",1245456000,3,613,4.241379310344827
2772606,5,B000NO243E,"This was an amazing film!
I first saw this when I picked up the movie Shutter at Best Buy, so if you want to buy it, you can get it there.

It's a ghost film with great action, but not with the same old long haired ghost. The movie revolves around a young ghost boy and these sort of ghosthunters observing him. The leader of the whole team wants to find out why this kid is a ghost, since he believe he will be able to hold the key to find out how to become one himself. There's a fresh plot with a very great acting. It's mostly a bit of a thriller, not too much horror here. If you enjoy asian horror movies, this is one to not miss!
I can't really give an extensive review on it without revealing too much of the plot. Go buy it!",1237507200,3,733,3.9194630872483223
2772607,1,B000NO243E,"This was a very disapointing film. Bought on the basis of other reviews but I should know better by now.

Very poor. Dreadful in fact.",1209254400,3,205,4.230769230769231

2772609,5,B000NO243E,"I certainly agree with all the other reviews. A complete story, unique imagination, with no ""missing links"" and had that atmosphere of reality which a lot of other ghost type movies lack which makes a huge difference. Would have been nice if the deleted scenes were not deleted, but nevertheless, a brilliant piece of work I reckon that stands out from the others, and concentrating on detail and coherency from start to finish.",1186790400,16,428,4.876712328767123
2772610,4,B000NO243E,"The film SILK is a very different and creative horror film. I also recommend it highly, especially if you are looking for something different in the horror genre. With a mixture of sci-fi and horror thrown together, SILK is one entertaining film. The story centers around a team of paranormal investigators who are led by one stubborn and heavily driven character in search of life after death. His name is Hashimoto,(Yosuke Eguchi), and he is the leader of this special paranormal research team. I found his particular character great. Hashimoto is a man in search of immortality; but one with a catch, as he tries to unravel the secrets of life after death.

Hashimoto recruits a select research team of other investigators, and among these is a police sniper named Tung (Change Chen) who has the ability to read lips. This ability to read lips is of the utmost importance to this group of paranormal researchers, and in particular Hashimoto. Their job? To discover the mystery of a boy who happens to also be a ghost. And this is one malevolent ghost. The film introduces the viewer to what is known as a Menger Sponge. This is where sci-fi meets horror. You see, the Menger Sponge is a special anti-gravity device that can enable the researchers to ensnare ghosts. Moreover, the Menger sponge has been reverted to a liquid spray which allows the researchers to see ghosts.

Personally, I found the film fascinating. This is a very different type of horror film. And I always like something different in the horror genre. Also, the acting in this film was very good. Hashimoto's character is great to watch, but the entire film is outstanding. And there are some sad moments to watch in this film as Hashimoto attempts to learn about the afterlife. Further, the character Tung (Chang Chen) gives an extremely good performance, especially when his sick mother is introduced to the film. Chao-Pin Su did a remarkable job with this film, as the writing, cinematography and characters meshed perfectly in this very creative film. I recommend the film SILK, especially for those who like intelligent horror films. The film delivers good horror and drama, and does so in an entertaining way. Highly recommended.

2772611,4,B000NO243E,"I really enjoyed this film. I am a fan of Asian horror films but have gotten tired of the same ""vengeful ghost"" scenario. OK, so maybe this movie DOES have a vengeful ghost, but it's premise of capturing a ghost for scientific purposes is pretty original. It's a cool blend of sci-fi and horror and I would highly recommend it to Asian horror fans.",1182384000,12,348,4.453125
2772612,4,B000NO243E,"SILK is a sleeper hit in Asia. I took a chance when I purchased the REGION-3 DTS Hong Kong release and man!, was I pleased with the decision. This is one of the best supernatural thrillers I've seen since SHUTTER, RINGU and THE SIXTH SENSE, and the best thing about it is it doesn't rely on the ""WATERLOGGED, long-haired ghost"" to achieve thrills. From what I heard the TARTAN release will use the same video transfer as the Deltamac release.

SYPNOSIS:(May have some spoilers)
The film is a mix of SCI-FI and the usual elements of ASIAN HORROR. A group of scientists led by Hashimoto, armed with a newly invented material called the MENGER SPONGE captures the energy of a ghost child. This invention financed/owned by the Japanese government, is quite malleable and can be used as a coat for walls, for camera filters and can be used as an eye-spray to allow the user to see Ghosts.
They enlist the aid of an agent named Ye Tung, a law enforcer from the JCCU, who can read lips and has a gifted eyesight, to assist them in unveiling the mystery of the ghost child. Hashimoto and his team lets the ghost child loose, so that,Ye, aided with the MENGER SPONGE spray, can see a strand of SILK that emanates from the supernatural child, this strand is the key to a mysterious power.
Ye tracks the ghostly boy and the strand to the horrifying truth of the child's death. Fearing that the ghost child is dangerous and for his own hidden agenda, Hashimoto,(and his team) decides to isolate him, but in doing so, they unknowingly unleashed the supernatural force in the other end of the SILK strand, a MUCH more POWERFUL, and MALEVOLENT energy.

This film really kept my attention for the whole 105 minutes. It doesn't have cheap scares, but instead relies on the plot to slowly unveal, the suspense builds up the closer you approach the climax. Each lead character is developed carefully. It is a story about love, hate and learning to let go, unlike most Asian horror flicks focuses on a VENGEFUL, Blood-thirsty ghost.
Note: The ""MENGER SPONGE"" does actually exist. Although, the actual Menger Sponge won't allow anyone to perform paranoramal feats or catch ghosts. I still think it is very interesting. Look it up in Wikipedia.

PICTURE: ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN(aspect ratio 1:78). The picture is nicely shot, sharp and smooth. The color pallette leans towards a ""Green Bleach"" hue, similar to most Japanese horror films. There are some video artifacts on some scenes, but not that noticeable. another very good video transfer from DELTAMAC.
AUDIO/SUBTITLES: Japanese/Mandarin- 5.1 DOLBY DIGITAL and 5.1 DTS. The DTS audio is the way to go. You can hear all the creaks and whispers in a much fuller sound. The English subtitles are well executed, not perfect with some typos here and there, but not distracting and annoying.
SPECIAL FEATURES: Deleted scenes, making-of, Outtakes, photo gallery, extra bonus.

This film is well-worth a look if you like SCI-FI Horror films. I saw this film 4-5 months ago(thanks to the magic of multi-region players), I'm pleased that it received a REGION-1 release this soon so people can see the quality films that come from Asia.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! (for Horror fans)[4 Stars]",1179705600,27,3204,4.841240875912408

2772634,4,B000NO243E,Inventive and innovative take on a ghost story.  Nice to see a movie about the supernatural that takes a more intellectual approach rather than drenching everything in buckets of blood.,1389052800,,185,5.166666666666667
2772635,3,B000NO243E,"In this film, Writer/Director Chao-Pin Su tries to escape the formulas
of modern Asia horror cinema, by introducing many disparate plot elements:
A secret military project of an anti-gravity device,
a SWAT team operation against a terrorist cell, a paranormal
investigator who is gradually losing his limbs from chronic diabetes,
an elite police officer who is devastated by his mother's terminal
sickness, the very sad ghost of a boy, and the very angry ghost of
the boy's mother. Unlike the silken strands-which are revealed in
the second half of the film to tie the dead with the living-
these elements are not tied in a coherent whole.
As mentioned by another reviewer, this is similar to the flaws

If there's a ghost, doesn't that make it horror?  Not really; there's also murder, suicide, science, and love, but this isn't a slasher, documentary or a romance.

2772640,5,B000NO243E,"Coming into the holiday season on a fixed SSI budget, i couldn't spend much for presents outside of my own immediate family... looking up Tartan Asian Extreme re-released region 1 DVDs, i found two in my own personal collection for less than $3.00 liquidated (assumed overstocked).  They were both above average and extremely good ""The Maid"" (more simple style high art quality cinematography) and ""Silk"" (conceptual Sci Fi, many friends saw it On Demand and enjoyed it as well)...

Both were sold directly from amazon.com and were eligable for super saving shipping for over $25... So I bought 6 copies of each, 12 all together, to give out as Xmas presents... Very good for me! sorry... i think it was me who drove up the price to about $5 or $6 each, forcing you to pay more...

Recently, I found a film I -haven't- seen in the same situation, Ab-Normal Beauty and bought two copies, one for me and one to give my brother a few different movies for Xmas.  He is another fan of Tartan Asian Extreme films...

Tartan is a European Hollywood style company, and they release the Best Asian Hollywood style films under the label... 'Extreme Horror', both straight forward gore and conceptual films, most often ghost stories, and 'Extreme Drama' like director Park Chan Wook's unconnected Revenge Trilogy about seeking revenge against kidnappers. These DVDs each had a huge price drop recently as well.

... Seemed like the only trilogy i've seen where getting better means getting way 'worse.'

This is more of a promotion for fans of foriegn films... and of the Tartan Asian Extreme Label...

This is the first review on Amazon i ever wrote as well!

Tartan Asian Extreme films at less than $3 at Super Savers over $25! if you have a cart that qualifies around $20-$22... surprise yourself with something cheap under this label, odds are if you like hollywood quality and listening to asian languages, from many different countries, so if you speak one, or dig one culture/dialect over the rest by acquantences, maybe search a bit more for Japan or Hong Kong Cantanese, Thailand, Korea, Philipeans...

the right price to level 22.?? or 23.?? to 25.??... with the chance of spiking a new interest future purchases...

Not Dubbed in English so B. Cool like School, and learn to read/pay attention to a movie at the same time!

2772641,3,B000NO243E,"I know this is a clichd thing to say, but I really tried to like ""Silk."" I was interested in the Taiwanese film because of the two names: Barbie Hsu, who played the heroine Shan Cai in the hit TV series ""Meteor Garden,"" and Yohei Taneda, acclaimed production designer, best known for the set of ""Aoba-ya"" in the bloody climax of Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill Vol. 1."" Well, I think both did a great job here. I regret to say that the film itself could have been much better. ""Silk"" is not very scary, but that is not a big problem. The film has an interesting idea only to be spoiled by the muddled script.

Somewhere in the city of Taipei, in a dark rundown apartment building, a team of scientists is conducting a strange experiment. They are trying to ""capture"" a ghost by using a special device, and they have succeeded in catching a spirit of a little boy. The team's leader, a mysterious Japanese Hashimoto (Yosuke Eguchi), asks an ace sniper and lip-reading expert Tung (Chen Chang) to join them for further research. Tung reluctantly accepts the job and he begins to monitor the ghost's curious behavior, and he soon realizes the discovery of the boy's secret past is just the beginning of violent deaths.

Writer-director Chao-Bin Su begins the story with an intriguing premise, but like in ""Double Vision,"" a supernatural thriller for which he wrote a script, he doesn't know how to develop the concept into something coherent. I don't mind the film's incredible scientific theories involving anti-gravity and Menger Sponge, but it is not a good thing when your film changes rules too frequently. The theme remains unfocused, restlessly shifting from one to another, as if looking for something new to show us. There are some unexpectedly touching moments, to be sure, but they just don't function well in the confusing story. As to Karena Lam and Chen Po-lin, they deserve much better roles.

There are some nice, creepy scenes involving Barbie Hsu's character.  ""Silk"" is a unique addition to the genre, with such topics as life, death and afterlife. It is only that they need more delicate treatment than is shown here.",1267660800,2,2133,4.788043478260869
2772642,4,B000NO243E,"Here's a film that attempts to deal with the meaning of life and love, the importance of self and the need for selflessness, and the existence of a reality outside our own. And it succeeds -- though, in my opinion, it misses a chance to tie things all together at the end.

Without providing a rehash of the plot, suffice to say the movie tries (and almost always succeeds) to present excitement, pathos and wondrous discovery all in one. The pacing is strong, the editing unfurls the story in an understandable and engaging way, and each character adds a distinct yet harmonious flavor to the stew.

SPOILERS TO COME -- STOP READING IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS (which I recommend highly)!

My issue was that the director missed a chance to bring all the story points together at the end. I saw the ""alternate director's choice ending"" that was an extra and didn't like it (too negative), and I didn't like the remade ending that was used in the main film (though it was better). It was too convoluted.

AGAIN, BE WARNED: SPOILER BELOW!

My suggested switch for the ending: When the main cop character appears to be dead on the train but gets brought back to life by a ghost's heart massage, the entity providing the massage SHOULD HAVE been his own mother, who had just died during her surgery. The cop character then awakens and sees his mother's ghost smiling, as if to say goodbye, and she then walks away -- ALONGSIDE the mother/son ghosts from the earlier part of the movie. All three then vaporize into the mist -- able to move on to the next life. This ending would have tied together the themes of afterlife, science, love and devotion to show how everyone is interconnected in this universe (and all others) and would have provided a profound statement on the meaning of life.
