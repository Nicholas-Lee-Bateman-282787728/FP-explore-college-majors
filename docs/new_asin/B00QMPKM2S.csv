6876548,5,B00QMPKM2S,"I really liked the way this information on Rocket Mass Heaters and ""Rocket"" technology was presented.

This is not one of those boring corporate training DVD's - what you're getting is a bird's-eye view of live workshops with occasional interjections of a panel discussion on the material presented, in a very engaging - yet very laid back environment.  It was actually hard to stop watching...  And now I feel ready to tackle a project!

I did a more in-depth video review here: [...]

The Good - Very easy to understand and visually-presented concepts.  Great Value - yes, it's $100 - but what you learn could save you many times that in your first season of heating, not to mention the frustration you'll avoid by learning from THEIR mistakes!

Could be Better - At several points, there were URL's to supplemental resources - they could include a list of these links in the dvd packaging so those who didn't take notes could easily find them.  :)  (or, just remember to take notes while watching!)

If you're thinking about building a rocket stove, but need a little push (or are worried about having the skills) this will make a great investment.  Having watched them create different variations of the stoves, and explaining in detail the ins & outs - you'll feel confident in the direction you need to go to make the leap.",1382918400,31,1329,4.70995670995671
6876549,5,B00QMPKM2S,"I have forgotten that I couldn't get to the workshop because I feel just like I was there... haven't missed a thing :)  Super people, invaluable information, and a great value.

6876550,5,B00QMPKM2S,"Purchased these a while back and was very happy with them.  Very detailed, fun to watch.  I intend to use them as part of our homeschool science curriculum.

6876551,5,B00QMPKM2S,"I have at this point only watched two of the four DVD's.  I watched the Fire Science DVD twice in a row there is so much good stuff in there.  I don't have a rocket mass heater yet, but I am able to start a fire even faster in my conventional woodstove due to what I learned in these videos.  I agree the production isn't the best, and I would give it a four star rating, but the information is outstanding.  I will use these resources for many years to come.",1382486400,21,459,4.010989010989011

I rated this five stars, even though the production values are dicey at times. The video isn't the best and the sound isn't always the best. However, the information provided in this video set is invaluable for anyone concerned about the environment, anyone trying to live sustainably AND comfortably, and anyone pursuing a homesteading lifestyle.

Ernie and Erica Wisner are great teachers, and despite the production quality, the clarity of their explanations and lessons comes through very well.  This is an excellent, EXCELLENT purchase for anyone who wants to jump into the world of Rocket Mass Heaters.",1382486400,21,752,5.056451612903226

I would have to agree with some of the other reviews that while the quality of the recordings is not the best but the information makes up for the lack of production.
Anyone that is concerned about the environment and looking for a comfortable lifestyle can benefit from the knowledge in these DVDS.

With that being said, It's great to have all this information on a 4 piece DVD set. These guys really know what they're doing. The hand-cam film style brings a truly authentic feel to each segment.  This set definitely comes recommended by me.  You may think a lot of this information is available on the internet, but there is so much unique content packed into these DVDs.  I learned more from one DVD then I could from a weeks worth of internet research. If you're thinking about building a Rocket Mass Heater, look no further than this set. It's a great investment that will assist you during the process. Thanks!",1407369600,2,733,4.572519083969466

They also spend ages talking about what they will eventually get around to talking about. The $100.00 price tag is beyond insane, this is extremely amateur in more ways than just the quality. The creators of this DVD have no concept of how to present concise or ""to the point"" information. There is some good info in there if you are willing to wade through hours of distasteful, ramble-on, repetitive, overpriced dialog to get to a bit of real useful demonstration of the information.",1399334400,11,602,4.583333333333333

6876577,5,B00QMPKM2S,"This DVD set I backed on Kickstarter.  I am very happy with my backing, but very disappointed we didn't make it to the last stretch goal.

That aside, this set of DVD's is well worth the meager investment.  If it's possible for the purchaser to implement this as their primary heating system then it's possible to save thousands of dollars per year.  In some climates it's possible to get a return on your investment within a week, or less.

The content is the most complete, and condensed, source of information that I'm aware of.  It contains enough information to make an informed decision on how to implement this.  For most it also contains enough information for people to install a Rocket Mass Heater in their residence, or garage.  This, of course, depends on local zoning regulations.

Personally I'm currently not in a position to implement any of the solutions found here, but who knows what the future will hold.  This information needs to get out to everyone!",1390953600,7,972,4.766467065868263

6876579,1,B00QMPKM2S,"A friend lent me this set which he seemed a bit disappointed by and wanted my opinion on as I also am interested in building a RMH. After discussing it we decided that these DVDs are an exhaustive interpretation of free information which is incredibly easy to find with a Google search and the video content as well as the production are kind of amateur.  While informative and probably great for those who are too lazy to do internet searches, they aren't worth the money they are advertised for.  I wouldn't pay more than $3-$5 for them.",1390521600,15,539,4.546391752577319

These DVD's cleared up a number of grey areas for me and I have helped build a couple Rocket Mass Heaters before these DVD's were available.  Excellent information, well worth the price in my opinion.",1389398400,9,426,4.653333333333333
6876585,5,B00QMPKM2S,"Paul Wheaton gave a sold out workshop on rocket store technology.  If you didn't get to go, you can watch much of the content on DVD.  There were also some animations added to make it more video friendly in the Fire Science Demo.

Ernie and Eric run the workshops and are featured in the videos.  They both speak well, are great teachers and know what they are doing.  I found the content I watched to be interesting and informative.  I live in a New York City apartment building so Im obviously not going to build a rocket mass heater.  But I could see how the videos would be useful to someone who would!

I actually visited Paul in Montana the month before the workshops were run.  I got to see where this was going to be filmed in person.  Its a good place to hold the workshops and a scenic view.  And there is plenty of wood and space around - both important things for a good workshop.

If you are expecting a polished, movie theater type documentary, youll be disappointed.  But I bet you aren't building a rocket mass heater in that kind of polished setting either.  So the reality is good.

One of the reviewers posted that the price point is too high.  A popular movie costs $20 on DVD at BestBuy.  This product is 4 DVDs.  Which takes you to $80.  And this isn't a mass market product, so you expect it to cost a little more.  Or contrast it to the cost of going to the workshop in person.  It cost  me over $500 to fly to Montana when I went. But if you really don't have the money (or don't have a DVD player for that matter), you can get it from vimeo.  $35 to rent for a month or $98 to buy.

The technical info is ok.  Even though a lot of it can be found on the net, I learned quite a bit.  I especially enjoyed learning about the correct way to build a fireplace. I didn't know it could be built to radiate heat so efficiently-for a fireplace- by observing a few angles in the construction.  Our fireplace definitely doesn't perform nearly as well, and it's brand new, but a cheap factory made unit.

One of mine didn't even work, it was a bad burn on a DVD-r (yes there are just dvd-r's) The company that sold them have done right and sent me a whole new set (that gets 5 stars)

As stated in every DVD at the beginning, the people at the workshop are given the preference, and the video takes a back seat.  And it sure does. . . why then are we paying $100+ for these.  I would have been satisfied at around $40.00 for the set, and happy at $20.00

The content is not very good at all - youtube videos and forums provide just as much information, free.

I just didn't like it though. It's not bad per se, but it failed my expectations. I'm not too dissapointed about things usually. I mean yes, there was a lot of information, a lot of stuff i have never seen before, and some reasonable information, but really when it comes down to it eh...

I was happy with about 30%.

I kinda felt a little ripped off. I expected clear plans and explanations throughout including nitty gritty close ups of every little thing. The part I most wanted to see was fast forwarded through. I kinda could watch it in regular speed if I rewounded it from the end. The water heating was really bad because they spent 30 min warning us about the explosiveness but when it came down to it there was no clear picture of how to do it really. I mean the guy drew on the board alot, but the actual technique or assembly went by the wayside. I was kinda pissed at the end of that one.

I'm really glad that Paul was able to buy land and I think the whole project in general is awesome. I'm on permies.com all the time, but this dvd set, in my opinion, is not worth the money. Looking back I would just have bought all the materials to make one instead and documented it on permies for help.

So amazing to see iron heated to forge temperatures with wood as fuel and no auxiliary fan needed--just rockety goodness.  If you heat your home, your cabin, your anything with fire you should watch this.  If you just like to see cool flamey fabulosity (OK now I'm just messing with the auto-correct :-) you should watch this.

Some of the video was taken with a small handheld camera held by a super tall guy (that would be Paul) standing in the back of a group of people at a workshop.  These parts can be a little harder to hear clearly, but I was able to hear every word.

So feeling as though I had been ripped off, I decided to email Paul and ask him for half of my money back. I figured this was an acceptable compromise. So weeks went by and I heard nothing back, until today when Jack Spirko personally emailed me.

He said I had threatened to back Paul unless he gave me my money, and generally belittled me. It was embarrasing because I genuinely like Jack, but in this instance he picked the wrong person to support. He should feel bad for even allowing Paul to recommend this terrible DVD set.

If you want to learn about building rocket mass heaters you will learn some things from this DVD. But it will take a VERY long time, and you will be told the same things over and over again for hours on end. In fact in one DVD they spend 40 minutes warning us not to do the thing they are about to show us, and then fail to communicate what it is they were so scared we might actually try and do.

This DVD series is a terrible failure that should be offered free free, or very little cost. But hey, glad paul could make a yearly salary on this thing. I for one won't be falling for that trick twice.",1386201600,25,1404,4.247191011235955

8691956,5,B00QMPKM2S,Wow! The amount of pure passion and science that went into developing this DVD series is incredible. I was amazed as to how much fun I had watching the videos. I am confident that I can build a wood stove with a little help due to the content in these videos. I will most certainly recommend this DVD set to others,1412985600,2,314,4.163934426229508
8691957,5,B00QMPKM2S,"I don't normally do these reviews but I saw the crap these DVDs were getting and it made me mad. So they aren't the most professionally filmed DVDs in the world, that does not devalue them in the LEAST. They have tons of great information and is that not what permaculture is about? Sharing the information to make this world a better place for our families and ourselves? I absolutely loved the casual vibe of these videos and I would imagine most people interested in permaculture wouldn't mind a little bit of a shaky camera either.",1410393600,,535,4.583333333333333
8691958,2,B00QMPKM2S,"I was one of the first to order this as soon as it came out (for $105!), and after viewing it I felt kind of like one of the suckers who paid $600 for an iPhone when they were first released. There is some great information in there, but the relevant bits would've fit easily on a 2-DVD set, at most. I suspect it was stretched out to 4 discs to make people think they were getting a lot more information than is actually contained. The A/V quality is poor and the content is repetitive and full of filler.

If the price had been $40 for a better-edited, 2 DVD set, I would give it 4 stars, but since I was underwhelmed with what I received, given the hype that was pitched pre-release, I'm giving it two, and will likely never purchase anything else from Paul's ""Empire"" in the future. I would recommend the latest edition of Ianto Evans and Leslie Jackson's book ""Rocket Mass Heaters"" instead if you are looking for actual plans or detailed information about making one of these stoves; for $20 it contains a lot of information.

Lastly, the ratings here are skewed heavily toward the positive, on account of Paul specifically asking his ""empire"" of thousands of supporters to come to Amazon and give positive reviews in order to counteract the negative reviews he'd been getting. If that's not shady, I'm Jim Jones!",1409702400,7,1318,4.533613445378151
