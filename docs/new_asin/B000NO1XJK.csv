2772947,1,B000NO1XJK,"When a famous psychiatrist commits suicide, his daughter (Pamela Franklin) asks an investigative news reporter (Stephen Boyd) - and one of her father's patients - to prove it was really murder.

This is a quirky and moody (read: dreary) mystery that quickly becomes tiresome due to a poor script and melodramatic direction.  Pamela Franklin always was a mature child actress, but here, at 14, she speaks and acts like a 40-year old woman and it's just not believable.  Boyd overacts as the reporter who is at turns testy and dull with unexplained fits of rage. The two supposedly have a friendship, which is never explained or justified and they spend the whole story shrieking at each other. We also sit through a series of red herrings when it's obvious who did what.

While the movie is really awful, it is of interest to see Richard Attenborough wasted in a small role with bad make-up and a pretty, young up-and-comer named Judi Dench in her movie debut.  Other than that, this is a manipulative, overwrought drama that should have had a better script and proper direction.",1341446400,2,1078,4.805405405405406
2772948,3,B000NO1XJK,"This 1964 movie was worth one box of low-fat Cheese-nips.  I figured I had it figured out, just by Jack Hawkins getting second-billing.  Ok, they outsmarted me on that.
I have three problems with this supposedly ""intelligent"" who-done-it.
1) The viewer is presumed to CARE about these characters of whom we only get thin, almost cliche, snippets of their reportedly shocking lives, and way too many loose ends remain at the end.
2) Too many scenes are shrill, and then we are supposed to just move on.
3) Although I never did like the 40s-50s movies with guys whose ""character"" is established simply by ""don't mess with me, I'm wearing a hat,"" many movies of the 60s replaced that with ""I am more successful than you, because I wear a buttoned-up suit all movie long.""  The biggest shock of the movie was that Stephen Boyd wasn't in a suit in the hospital bed.

Anyway, catch this one on TMC or borrow it from a friend.",1334102400,3,919,4.551515151515152
2772949,2,B000NO1XJK,"I'm surprised to see that other people actually enjoyed this film, since I would rank it as perhaps the worst psychological thriller I have ever seen. A turgid script, weak lead performances, and lackluster direction make for a tedious experience. The DVD transfer is acceptable, though the contrast is rather excessive (perhaps a recently struck print was the source). With so many fine films unreleased on DVD, it is rather a mystery why this entirely lackluster effort has been released.",1310256000,,490,5.1375
2772950,4,B000NO1XJK,"This is a fine movie, although some parts of it are a little overwrought. Both Stephen Boyd and Pamela Franklin manage good performances. If you will remember, Stephen Boyd did one of the greatest ""death scenes"" ever in Ben-Hur. Any mystery fan will like this one! Oh, by the way a great supporting cast; Jack Hawkins good, as usual.",1202947200,2,333,4.661016949152542
2772951,5,B000NO1XJK,"A British psychologist has apparently committed suicide, but his teenage daughter is convinced it was murder and asks one of his patients (Stephen Boyd, as an expatriate American journalist) to investigate. Somber, brooding, introspective tale, with Boyd well-cast in the lead.  The film is elegantly written (and worthwhile just for the dialogue) and moodily shot in black and white.

Regrettably, the film is inaccurate in its portrayal of psychiatry; despite what the script says, people suffering from paranoid schizophrenia are no more likely to be murderers than anyone else, and people with schizophrenia cannot hide their illness as though they were undercover spies. That small suspension of disbelief aside, the film ruminates on all sorts of interesting ideas that fit together like inlaid wood.

It's also enhanced by an excellent cast -- besides Boyd, it features Jack Hawkins, Richard Attenborough, and Diane Cilento as the three suspects, the now-legendary Judi Dench in her first credited role, and the much under-rated child actress, Pamela Franklin, as the psychologist's daughter. In particular, though, Attenborough's performance as an awkward, insecure art dealer stands out as a remarkable contrast to his performance in another film of 1964 -- ""Guns at Batasi,"" in which he plays a tough, almost indestructible British Army sergeant.",1190246400,5,1356,5.509615384615385
2772952,4,B000NO1XJK,"Here's a tidy little British suspense film from 1964 that will hold your interest throughout. Well-received and highly regarded at the time, it soon fell out of view, overshadowed by THE NANNY and BUNNY LAKE IS MISSING and SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON and several other, more sensational British chillers of the same era. Now it's back on DVD, and worth a look from anyone who enjoys a literate, well-acted mystery.

A London psychiatrist is found dead, an apparent suicide, but his young daughter (Pamela Franklin) is convinced he was murdered by one of his patients. She appeals to the only patient she trusts, a TV commentator played by Stephen Boyd, to investigate the others. One of them is a dangerous paranoid schizophrenic--but who is it? The passive/aggressive art dealer (Richard Attenborough)? The frigid secretary (Diane Cilento)? The eminent judge with an unmentionable vice (Jack Hawkins)? Or is it Boyd himself, whose recent loss of wife and child to tragedy has unbalanced him, causing disturbing dreams and sudden, violent behavior? He investigates, leading to a surprise finale.

The publicity for the film played on the recent success of PSYCHO and DIABOLIQUE, asking audiences to see it from the beginning and please not to reveal the shocking ""third secret"" to other potential moviegoers. It's not really as shocking as all that--not now, anyway, though it might have been in 1964--but it's a solid, entertaining diversion. Try it.",1181347200,14,1449,5.135593220338983
2772953,5,B000NO1XJK,"Here's a powerful film that was completely unknown to me, one that deserves to be much better known. It's suspenseful & unsettling, but it's also far more than that.

When a noted psychiatrist dies suddenly, the official decree is suicide. But his fourteen year old daughter Cathy (a stunning young Pamela Franklin) doesn't believe her father would have killed himself, and she pleads with TV commentator Alex Stedman (an equally good Stephen Boyd) to investigate.

Alex has his own reasons for wanting to discover the truth. A patient of the dead psychiatrist himself, he's been shattered by the suicide. The doctor helped pull Alex out of despair when his wife & daughter died, and Alex fears that suicide means that everything that helped him was a lie. He desperately needs to learn the truth for the sake of his own sanity. So he begins investigating the doctor's other recent patients, sure that one of them must be a murderer.

What makes this film especially striking is the overall look & tone of it. Filmed in black & white, there's a world-weariness to it, a sense of balancing precariously over a dark, chaotic abyss that waits to claim everyone. Stephen Boyd is superb, his handsome but hard face etched with grief & doubt. He erupts in rage & fear at times, and raises the suspicion that he may be the murderer himself, having blotted out that self-knowledge. Could it be possible? Or is he simply struggling to survive in a world bereft of personal meaning?

We follow his investigation, which leads first to a tortured gallery owner & aspiring painter played by an unrecognizable Richard Attenborough; then to an intimate encounter with another patient, portrayed with brittle beauty & growing despair by Diane Cilento; and finally to a craggy, distinguished judge with a secret, played by Jack Hawkins.

But the most fascinating relationship is between Alex & fourteen year old Cathy. She's unnaturally precocious, a woman-child wise beyond her years, who obviously sees an understanding father figure in Alex. He in turn sees his own dead daughter as she might have been, and it's only in her presence that his grim face softens with tenderness & hope. Some modern viewers might tend to see this relationship as Cathy's suspicious uncle does, that of a predator moving in on a vulnerable girl. But it's something quite different, innocent yet somehow erotic all the same -- certainly it's the most intense relationship in the film.

The script is highly literate, the sort of writing that's seldom seen in films today. And the suspense builds as the film moves forward, an almost existential suspense -- the mystery isn't just about the identity of the murderer, but whether life itself has any meaning. It leads to a stunning climax that frankly jolted me. I wondered if it might not be better to end the film at that point, which would have been terribly bleak but effective. Yet the final scenes, while not viscerally shocking, are all the more sad & heartbreakingly tender, reminding the viewer that some wounds never fully heal.

Most highly recommended!",1180915200,38,3077,4.917148362235068
2772954,4,B000NO1XJK,"This 1964 British import was directed by Charles Crichton.  Starring Stephen Boyd (Ben Hur, Fantastic Voyage), Jack Hawkins (The Cruel Sea, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Ben Hur, Lawrence of Arabia), Diane Cilento (Hombre, The Wicker Man--and married to Sean Connery 1962-72), Richard Attenborough (In Which We Serve, The Great Escape, The Flight Of The Phoenix, The Sand Pebbles), and Pamela Franklin (The Innocents, The Legend Of Hell House).

  I might be totally off base here as I have not seen this little gem for 30 plus years but I think we've got the first secret is what we don't tell other people. The second secret is what we don't tell ourselves.  The Third Secret is.......  I do remember being totally into this mystery and look forward to it's DVD release.

8179815,5,B000NO1XJK,A great English film noir movie from the 1950s.  Best if you don't know the surprising ending.  Who killed Dr. Whitset?  You'd never guess!  Hint: Pamala Franklin breaks our hearts from the start to the finish.,1447977600,,210,4.75
8179816,3,B000NO1XJK,"Dated and rather stodgy mystery thriller about a reporter (Stephen Boyd--alternately hammy and wooden, mostly the latter) enlisted by the daughter of a psychiatrist who supposedly killed himself (Pamela Franklin, excellent) because she doesn't believe the coroner's verdict and thinks one of her father's patients actually murdered him.  This would make an interesting double bill with The Color Of Night, the disreputable Bruce Willis erotic thriller from 1994 since they both use a similar premise in almost entirely opposite ways.  While I prefer director Richard Rush's more garish approach in the far more lively The Color of Night some people might find this respectable and low-key effort more appealing.

The biggest problem I had with The Third Secret is that they really could have used a good psychological consultant.  Despite the fact that one of the characters brands paranoid schizophrenics the most dangerous of the mentally ill the fact is they are rarely dangerous and it's also a mental illness with very obvious symptoms including hallucinations and violent, paranoid outbursts--it's not a mental illness someone would be able to hide and it's also not a mental illness the killer in the film displays many symptoms of.  The movie seems to be using symptoms of Antisocial Personality Disorder (which is a type of mental illness a person can hide since they can mimic normal behavior--think Dexter, although he would be a very extreme example) and Multiple Personality Disorder (people who are schizophrenic do not have multiple personalities).

In any case The Third Secret is pretty slow and talky, but not entirely uninteresting.  The movie hints that the main character doing the investigating, the television reporter, might actually be the killer and not realize it himself and the movie does a pretty good job of keeping the did-he-or-didn't-he high-wire act up to nearly the end of the film, which keeps things mildly involving, if not exactly exciting.  Since nobody is trying to stop the reporter from finding out the truth and the conflict is primarily inside the reporter's head things never really get much above a low simmer, suspense wise.

Pamela Franklin is excellent as the psychiatrist's adolescent daughter who is bright and precocious and determined to prove the truth about her father's death.  Stephen Boyd has a bit of a wooden Dana Andrews quality to him that works at times, but when his character is having psychic freak-outs the actor seems to be in over his head.  The rest of the cast is solid, with nobody really standing out--including Judi Dench in her film debut.

I guess if you're old enough where this is your idea of they-don't-make-them-like-this-anymore then you might well enjoy The Third Secret quite a bit more than I did.  I found it a bit on the dull and too restrained side but it's worth a look if you are a fan of the mystery genre--or of movies that make a shambles of psychology with the straight face of a good liar or someone who really doesn't know any better.  The ending is surprisingly effective and sad, but whether you can actually get there is another matter.  Movies changed so much in the 1970's and 1980's that I'm guessing younger people would likely find this completely unwatchable.",1444953600,,3266,5.033395176252319

His daughter Catherine Whitset (Pamela Franklin) is not so sure and presses news commentator Alex Stedman (Stephen Boyd), a former patient of Dr. Whitset into investigating the situation.

As the mystery deepens we may not want to know what Alex finds; however we cannot turn away until the very end.
