1783638,3,B00006L91F,"The Roswell story has been an interesting piece of ""urban legend"" for some time now.  Did our government conspire to cover up the supposed crash landing of an alien spaceship?  We'll never really know the truth, I'm sure.  ROSWELL is an intriguing movie, although it lacks any real suspense and since we know how it ends, one is left with what is basically a character study of Jesse, the soldier who was humiliated and promoted in order to keep his mouth shut.  Kyle MacLachlan, one of our most underrated actors, gives a solid, sturdy performance, even though his makeup conjures up images of Brad Dourif.  Martin Sheen's enigmatic character makes an appearance at the end of the film, but we never know who he is.  Dwight Yoakam does well as the farmer who first discovers the wreckage.  However, only MacLachlan's character is developed fully enough to care about.  A clean, clinical and provocative movie; just not a great one.",1086220800,5,932,4.817610062893082
1783639,5,B00006L91F,"As I indicated in my review of debunker Karl Pflock's Roswell book, there is an erroneous belief that if you can disprove the Roswell Incident, you have automatically debunked all UFO reports. How ridiculous.
This is the case they feel they HAVE to crush in order to get a handle on disempowering the pro-UFO/Alien lobby. When you watch this movie, you will understand why.
Roswell is a very well made movie, with an excellent cast, which features some powerful performances by Kyle Mac and Dwight Yoakam above all.
The UFO debunkers will hate it because it tells the story of an actual Alien incident including the recovery of at least one semi-telepathic crash survivor.
Some contemporary UFO purists will have a problem because of the artistic license taken and the fact that it seems like Marcel was stuck between a rock and a hard place, having wanted to release the true account of the crash - whereas now some people believe that Marcel was told to release an exaggerated 'crashed disk' report by Blanchard, which was then pulled/denied in true disinformation style.
Whatever the theorizing, this movie tells a fairly traditional Roswell story, which includes all of the main elements of the discovery and cover-up. If anything, as another reviewer said, a worst case scenario.
The Project Mogul balloon that debunkers keep whining about, DID have a roughly disk-shaped instrument gondola suspended way beneath it, but nobody in their right mind could EVER mistake it for a craft that was capable of independent flight, even if it had become totally separated from the mother balloon, which seems not to have been the case, per their own debunking mythology.
This movie has a feel about it that just gets under your skin, and for many reasons, flaws and artistic license or not, it flows more like a documentary of Marcel's life than a piece of pure fiction. When you compare the flow and feel of this movie with the infantile ramblings of debunkers such as the barely literate Kal K. Korff (yeah, KKK), you cannot help but feel that the movie is the closest thing we might ever know to the Truth.
The idea that the whole Incident was a piece of disinformation, to fool the Russians or whatever, falls apart instantly for 10,000 reasons and is perhaps the most ludicrous suggestion of all.
No, something unusual came down in Roswell, and until the Government comes clean, and stops fabricating seemingly deliberately absurd 'explanations', the story told in this movie may be considered a very reasonable possible scenario.
Very highly recommended.",1066003200,41,2555,4.944186046511628

1783656,5,B00006L91F,"This is an account of the Roswell incident which took place in the New Mexico desert in 1947.  Something crashed there, and was discovered by a no-nonsense rancher, Mac Brazel.  At first a nearby US Army base declared openly that they had found a crashed flying saucer, but later (presumably when the government or intelligence people got hold of the story) they changed their story and announced that their very experienced staff had mistaken a 'weather baloon' for a spaceship!
The story is told through the eyes of the witness to the event, and although their stories don't always agree, it is obvious that there is a kernel of truth there, and that something wonderful and strange did happen.  Unfortunately, for whatever reason the powers that be chose to cover up the truth of the incident.
All of the actors do a sterling job of representing real people, caught up in events that overwhelm them, both emotionally and intellectually.  It is an extraordinarily moving film, and just the viewer wondering how it could all continue to be swept under the table for fifty years and more.",1285027200,5,1088,4.833333333333333

I visited Roswell, New Mexico not too long ago and wanted to see more about the famous ""crash"" and when I saw this movie listed I couldn't resist buying it.  It was both informative and entertaining with something for everyone.  Makes a person stop and wonder, did it really happen......?",1261353600,2,309,4.685185185185185
1783659,5,B00006L91F,"This is one of those rare, and virtually unknown, movies that really makes your brain fire on all cylinders.  A fantastic cast that gives stunning performances, very well directed, an eerie but realistic atmosphere, and special effects that don't make you wince.  Plus, it's a ""true"" story that portrays both sides most convincingly.  This movie will please those who believe in extraterrestrial life and those who don't.  Put all these elements together and you've got one helluva flick!  Why the studio won't release this on DVD blows my mind.  I've got an old VHS copy of it that I taped off TV...and it's nearly been played to oblivion.  SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU CAN!!!!",1182211200,5,671,4.833333333333333

1783661,5,B00006L91F,"The fact that this movie even got made is a miracle. It's not perfect, but you have to realise how the US Gov't ""intelligence"" services (which we fund w/ our taxes) tried amazing disinformation, threats and lies to keep not only the honest folks of Roswell doubting their sanity, but all of America as well. Kyle Mac does a really fine job as Jesse Marcel who had to 'smile and lie' and at the same time either let others think he was crazy (couldn't tell the difference from indestructible unearthly 'living' metals from a weather balloon!?) or a big fat liar (collected boxes of this amazing stuff, then had to deny it). And the man had attained the rank of Major at the world's (then) ONLY heavy Bomb Army Air Force base in the world! The fine supporting cast via flashbacks add drama and accuracy to all of what the authors had for testimony...at that time. Since the July '47 Roswell was the final straw for the government and the oil industry- the covering up of Truth that we have galactic neighbors (who are smarter than us, but haven't destroyed us!), the CIA, DIA, NSA were all created to smother ALL future UFO sightings and truth. Go read some of the books on this as well as the other coverups. Welcome to the Future. And go see [...] too. Mindblowing, the covering up is still going on! You kids under 40 (ha,ha!) have to expose this now.",1117065600,14,1352,4.477732793522267
1783662,4,B00006L91F,"This DVD could use a few more features, like language options and widescreen for starters.  So expect just a basic DVD when you get it.

Personally I don't believe in aliens but it's fun to speculate.  I think what's difficult to believe is that they travel millions and millions of miles safely and then just lose control and crash on Earth.  Maybe the cruise control was on and they just dozed off.

BUT let's look at the story of Roswell; one that has been revisted many times.  Our hero is Major Jesse Marcel (Kyle Maclachlan) who is asked to investigate some sort of crashed aerial vehicle at the ranch of Mac Brasel (country star Dwight Yoakum - actually better than I would have imagined).

Possibly due to budget constraints, the film has the look of a made-for-TV movie and maybe that was the intended target.  However, it does have a nice feel of the ""coverup"" and ""misdirection"" as we watch an ailing Marcel flashback and review the events of 1947 with his former associates and family.  Now, nobody doubts that the real Major Jesse Marcel would not know a weather balloon, so obviously something was afoot.  The question is ""what?"".  Evidently something was amiss and from the obscurity the legend has only grown.

There are some beautiful airplanes in the film, including a pristine Boeing B-29 bomber and a beautiful Northrup P-61 ""Black Widow"" (only partially seen).  For those who don't know, the P-61 was a night fighter, radar-equipped, similar in concept to the high-performance Lockheed P-38 ""Lightning"".  It also shot down some German V-1 buzz bombs (the crude but terrifying cruise missiles of their day).

The cast is pretty good with Martin Sheen as ""Townsend"", the official gov't disinformation specialist.  Others include Xander Berkeley as the cagey gov't intelligence liason.  There are a host of others you'll recognize from several films.  Definitely an all-star cast.

This film is an overview of the events and doesn't examine them critically, but presents the rumors and speculations as generally associated with the infamous incident.  For that, it's good entertainment and halfway decent science fiction.

I'd give it 3.5 stars but there's no 1/2 rating so it gets 4 stars.  Don't expect your questions to be resolved but you'll have fun with the film.  Someday it would be fun to take a trip to Roswell, New Mexico and see all the sights.  Until then, here's the DVD.",1117065600,8,2403,4.891089108910891

It makes you think, and wonder, if an alien spaceship crash landing in Roswell actually happened all those years ago???  The questions that linger and ""hint"" through-out the movie rivets and spell-binds you into wondering what's real and what isn't when you hear about the determined government cover-up and one man's desperate search to find out the truth.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It's extremely entertaining, well told and thought-provoking. I highly recommend it.",1376524800,,562,5.280898876404494
