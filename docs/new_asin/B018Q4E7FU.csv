8742677,3,B018Q4E7FU,"This DVD collection of Lennon songs -- and some of McCartney's Beatles stuff, too -- contains some hits and several notable misses, but overall is worthwhile when priced below ten bucks for Lennon archivists of the pre-Saint John era of pop music.  At this writing we are in a post-St John phase thanks to the naivete of the Internet in which personal peccadilloes are magnified at the expense of clear-eared appreciation of talent.  So it's refreshing and quaint to see Yoko, Ringo, and others decked out with Eighties hairstyles.  Sean Lennon provides perhaps the best moment of his meagre career w/ a perky performance of Dear Prudence.  Starr's rendition of I Call Your Name, backed by Tom Petty, Jim Keltner, and Jeff Lynne along w/ Roy Orbison's posthumous version of Help! lend a friendly Wilbury-esque feeling to the mix, but one wonders why George didn't contribute.  Even Paul singing his own PS I Love You w/ Linda on keyboards and his old Nineties band gets good enough for government work when Macca segues into Love Me Do (again one of his own tunes).  Musical director Dave Edmunds does a decent job that could've been much better.",1494201600,,1146,4.821428571428571

8742679,1,B018Q4E7FU,"I ordered this recently on a lark, since no one had reviewed it.  The copy I got is terrible.  The sound is muffled and basically in only one channel.  The video is acceptable at best.  It comes across as if someone in the audience brought a hand-held video camera to the concert and transferred that to a DVD.  If someone else has bought this and has a better opinion, then maybe I got some sort of lemon product... but I don't think so.  At the price I'm seeing as of this writing ($17.99), you're wasting your money to buy it.  Even if someone gave it to you, I doubt you'd be able to sit through it all just because of the audio.  Amazon should have one of their employees watch this.  I think they might discontinue selling it if they did.",1464307200,4,744,4.219858156028369
