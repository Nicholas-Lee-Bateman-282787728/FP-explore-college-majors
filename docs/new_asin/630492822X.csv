939984,5,630492822X,I am buying the series seperately as the complete set includes season 1 which I already had. Still superior to the garbage sit coms on air today. Two comedies from the 1950's have stood the test of time the other being the Honeymooners. The only glitch is that it took the clowns at CBS such a long time to release it.,1430697600,3,318,4.229508196721311
939985,5,630492822X,"The series is a great classic.  Phil Silvers was a very, very funny guy.  I bought the 50th Anniversary set and Season One back in mid 2010.  I was thinking about buying the complete series, when I saw that Shout Factory was bringing out the Second Season packaged like the First Season, so I pre-ordered it.  The Amazon.com box just got here today 4/28.  The DVD case looks just like the First Season put out by Paramount back in 2010.  The back of the case indicates English subtitles, so I popped in the first disc to check and played a few minutes of the first episode.  Yep, it indeed has subtitles.  The print I viewed (maybe 3 minutes) look very good.  I'm pleased.  I'll be watching for season three.",1430179200,6,708,4.4186046511627906

939987,5,630492822X,"I am looking forward to this release. I bought season 1 some time ago and enjoyed it immensely. However, I was quite annoyed when the whole series was released as a single package, as I didn't want to have to buy the first season again just to get the rest. So you can bet that I will be getting this season and the others if/when they are offered in separate releases.",1421971200,6,369,4.211267605633803

7879482,5,630492822X,"Even though Sgt. Bilko aired almost 60 years ago, it is a Classic and still hillarious.  It brings back nice memories of watching this show with my father and brothers on an old black and white TV set.  Shipped very fast and delivered as promised.  Thank you.",1436572800,,259,4.468085106382978
7879483,1,630492822X,"I,like many of you, have learned over many years to be suspicious of companies that produce products that are not consistently of good quality. In the DVD media world, Shout Factory is right near the top of the list. Their products have been hit and miss for years,and this, Season Two of the Phil Silvers Show,is one that is a definite miss.
Season one of this series saw CBS and Paramount teaming up to produce the end product. The eps were grainy and had just the bare bones remastering. For the second,it seems Paramount has dropped out of the equation and Shout Factory has come in to fill the void. And the reason I am advising against buying this product may be one of the reasons why. On the first disc,second ep,about 10 minutes in where Bilko is talking to the chaplain,a video line appears and disappears. I had to go back to see if I had somehow mistook what I saw. Unfortunately it was all too true. Then later on in Bilkos War on Culture,there is yet another tape line crossing the screen near the end of the ep. The last ep, Bilkos Wedding, also has a tape anomaly. On the second disc there is Where There is a Will. Not only are there tape lines about half way through,but the entie ep is plagued with  a constant sound distortion problem. Absolutely pathetic .With Shout Factory taking the reigns, something else has changed. Unlike Season One,Season Two,at the end of each ep,shows the Viacom syndication logo. That means instead of newer prints,we are stuck with the old Viacom syndication tapes for a source of the shows. It wouldn't be so bad if any anomalies were corrected in transferring them to DVD.But no.
I was going to contact Shout for comment but I immediately stopped myself. In a Season of McHales Navy the exact same thing occurs during one of those eps. When I contacted them then they explained that they just used what ever they were given. One doesn't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out what they would say this time.
Well I stopped buying any further sets of McHales Navy because of that and I am going to do the same now with this series. How sad that in this day and age that if source anomalies crop up that need correcting,companies like this don't have the guts to say ""No"" and to ask for other prints. What has happened to quality control?What has happened to a word called""integrity""?
Shout Factory should be utterly ashamed for releasing a show in this condition. The Phil Silver Shows is one of my fave shows of all time(and obviously for many others)and to see it released with no regard for the buying public is a real kick in the pants. Another black mark to Shout Factory and a BIG thumbs down to CBS for releasing these eps via the old Viacom syndication tapes.",1435795200,7,2722,4.498989898989899
