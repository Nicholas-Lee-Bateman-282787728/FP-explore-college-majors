8485558,3,B005SV603C,"Unfortunately i rated it middle of the road simply because i never received it. This is not all that uncommon, i am very busy and order items but simply move on even if it is not received. My billing does not specify the product ordered. Sometime ago it was necessary to place an order for Quo Vadis twice before receiving it. I believe i experienced the same with El Cid, however if debt collapse becomes available again, or if i can think of it, i will most likely order it again. I need to create a follow up file in order to insure freceipt of the titles that i order and to aid you in follow up. Thank you.

If you already know, this is largely a sales pitch for his book.  But there are good tidbits here.  If you look, not too hard, you can view this on the tube of you.  Ron Paul and Joseph P. Farrell ['banksters'] and Max Keiser (on RT) are all good sources for similar information.  Others like Peter Schiff, Gerald Celente and others on newsmax infomercials tend more to the extreme edges of the hype.",1368576000,6,514,4.483870967741935
