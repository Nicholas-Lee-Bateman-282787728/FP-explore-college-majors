8588823,4,6303541240,"Not a bad set. It consists of ""Chrysler Legends"" (also available seperately) and Chryslers at Carlyle 1992.
The first tape covers a rough history of Mopars and interviews owners of cars like the Town &  Country, C300, etc. Old 50's car commertials are intermixed.
The second  tape covers the 1992 Chrylers at Carlyle with interviews of several well  known Mopar racers and lots of burnouts.
I purchased them to show before  the Mopar Alley general meetings and I think they will go over well.",935625600,4,492,4.821428571428571
