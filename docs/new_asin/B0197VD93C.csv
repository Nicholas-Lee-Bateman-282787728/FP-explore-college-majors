8744360,4,B0197VD93C,"Haven't gotten around to actually going through the workout itself with the stretching strap, but plan to add it to my routine to increase flexibility. Browsed the DVD for the purposes of seeing if it's a reasonable stretching program and it certainly seems to be. Just have to hit the floormat and commit to doing it.",1478476800,,318,4.696428571428571
8744361,4,B0197VD93C,"I grew up taking dance, so I have always been pretty flexible. It was something I never really had to work at, I just was. Then earlier this year I had to have some surgery that required me to limit my mobility for a few weeks. I had to spend a significant amount of time siting with my feet elevated and in bed. As I progressed with my rehabilitation I started to have backaches. I spoke to my chiropractor and he decided the pain was from tightness between my lower back and legs, as well as my hip flexors. He suggested I get a yoga strap and gradually work on reconditioning those areas. I have never had to use a strap and was concerned about doing modifications incorrectly. I went in search of something I could use as a reference.

This DVD has been a great resource for me. Being able to see the full range of the motion is so much better that looking at illustrations in a book. I keep my remote nearby to pause so I can go at my own pace once I have the stretch. I like to hold and push the stretch for quite a while. I have been using the video and my strap for  a few weeks and have already had the benefit of much less pain in my back and an obvious increase in my range of motion in several areas. I feel like I am nor ready to move to a Yoga class, which I will still be using my strap. I will continue to use the video as a resource as I continue my rehabilitation.

8744363,5,B0197VD93C,"The DanceCrazy Ultimate Stretching Exercises DVD  Pilates and Yoga Stretch Belts and Straps Muscle Relief Step by Step by SalsaCrazy, Inc arrived in a timely manner and was packaged nicely.  I was not able to try out this video initially as quickly as I had intended.  I ended up having abdominal surgery so it kind of delayed me a bit.  I will say, however, this is a very nice video.  It is perfect for the beginner that I am.  My husband recently had back surgery and we are both wanting to start doing some yoga so I ordered this video and a couple straps so we could start doing yoga together.  Please note that despite the title of the item, this is the instructional video only.  If you do not yet have a yoga stretching strap you will need to order that separately.  As others have said, the video only does show you one side, but I am pretty sure we can all easily adjust to accommodate that feature of the DVD.  I definitely do not consider it a flaw by any means.  This is a very nicely done yoga stretching strap video to help introduce you to the basic stretches you can do with your stretching strap.  This video has been a great addition to exercise routine.  I was fortunate enough to receive the DanceCrazy Ultimate Stretching Exercises DVD  Pilates and Yoga Stretch Belts and Straps Muscle Relief Step by Step by SalsaCrazy, Inc at a discounted price or free in exchange for my honest feedback about the product.",1466467200,,1430,4.45
8744364,5,B0197VD93C,"I got the stretch bands to start exercising but then had no clue how to use them!  I was so happy to find this DVD!  It's motivational and instructional even for someone who is totally new to exercising. I recommend it!
When I read other people's reviews, I would like to know a little bit about the person whose review I'm reading and see if we have much in common. For this reason, I will disclose personal information about myself. So that if you are like me, you will know how much you want to value my opinion. This is by no means ""bragging"" but informing the reader of why I'm reviewing a certain product.
ABOUT ME:
I am an elementary school counselor and am always looking things to use with my students, in lessons, or at school. As a counselor, I am very drawn to relaxation ideas, techniques, and gadgets. Music, stress relievers, massage .tools, you name it! I love them all!
I am a 45 year old Mexican woman who has been happily married for 25 years. I'm about 5'4 and weigh more than I would like to. I've never liked exercising but my husband loves running and has even run a marathon. Recently, we realized that getting fit is no longer an option if we want to grow old together and be agile, so we decided to turn one of our bedrooms into a yoga/exercise room.
We have an eight year old cockapoo who tends to gain weight rather easily.
One of my greatest and newest passions is gardening! I'm having a hard time this year starting from seeds but last year they did beautifully! My husband is an avid gardener and landscaping artist, so I'm the newbie. We live in the desert, So water is scarce and going green necessary.
I share these things about because I will be reviewing fitness products, gardening tools, vitamins, herbal supply and Beauty products, so I want to give review readers an idea of who I am.

I did received this product at a discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. I received no compensation for this review and I am not required to give a good review. I am also not associated with the seller in any way.",1465689600,,2065,4.372395833333333
8744365,3,B0197VD93C,A lot of really good stretches some you wouldn't even think of and we all could use a good stretch my only dislike is that she goes over one side and then says for you to do the other side your self and then join her back for another move on the DVD. I think she should be going over the move on both sides so you don't have to keep pausing the DVD,1461196800,3,348,3.7162162162162162
8744366,5,B0197VD93C,I love this dvd!! It has great ways to work out and its very good to use. I love how the easy the exercise are and you can do them on your own. I really would recommend this if you are beginner and never have worked out. I did get this product at discount price for my review.,1460678400,,276,3.7758620689655173
8744367,5,B0197VD93C,"I have been doing several extensive workouts but suffer from chronic pain and multiple longstanding issues from a car accident 12 years ago. While the workouts have been helping me strengthen, I also needed something to help me stretch out and not be so tight. I've tried a lot of Pilates and yoga but due to the chronic conditions many I struggle do adequately so I have not been able to find as much relief from doing this. With the instruction on this DVD I have been able to use the stretching strap (purchased separately) and do the Pilates & Yoga more effectively thus finding some much appreciated relief! The DVD takes each stretch and simplifies it almost to where it's remedial so if your advanced in Yoga and Pilates you may find it annoying. For me however, it was perfect. It shows you each exercise in detail and then you can pause the video and do it on the other side. So while it is not a workout video it can be used to get some very effective stretching. Each part of the body is done separately so there isn't any chance of misunderstanding how to properly do the stretch. Overall, I am very happy I purchased this and am grateful for the relief it's given me.",1458518400,,1180,4.41743119266055
