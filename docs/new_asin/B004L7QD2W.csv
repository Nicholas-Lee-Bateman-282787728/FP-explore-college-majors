8433925,5,B004L7QD2W,This movie is a great one to sit down with the family and have a good belly laugh. The comical adventure had my daughter laughing but unable to turn away. It was great fun for the whole family.,1373155200,,193,4.105263157894737
8433926,3,B004L7QD2W,"This is a cute Hindi film. The kids seemed to enjoy it. I would rate it along with cheap made-for-kids Hollywood cartoons. It's not Disney or Pixar - just a ride through a kid's imagination, just for fun.",1352764800,,204,4.394736842105263
