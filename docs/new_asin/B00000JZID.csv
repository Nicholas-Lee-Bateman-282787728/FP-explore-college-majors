7913874,5,B00000JZID,I am happy that I purchased this DVD. It's a bit out of date but I like that they have an 8-10year update at the end on some of the mother's and their children.,1502755200,,160,3.735294117647059
7913875,3,B00000JZID,"I enjoyed this movie. It is a little outdated given it was done in 1997. It was nice to see that these women were the pioneers. I feel much more women are making that choice today. I am glad the director did several different time periods. There was even an update from 1999-2007. I was disappointed not every woman in the group was profiled.

It really showed the journey. Also what they thought motherhood would be. To what it actually was. I wanted more at the end. I guess in this facebook and blogger age. I wanted their websites so I could go and get an update.",1317945600,,567,4.299065420560748

7913877,5,B00000JZID,"I love this film about a group of 8 women who pursue single motherhood via adoption or donor insemination. This film chronicles the stories of several women in the New York ""Single Mothers By Choice"" group. The film sensitively shows each woman's longing for motherhood, their families' reactions to their choices to become single mothers, the struggles of some with infertility, and each one's journey towards motherhood via donor insemination or adoption.

The documentary follows the group for 2 years. As you watch their stories unfold, you find yourself crying, hoping, and cheering along with them. The final scene shows each woman 1 year later with her child, some still waiting for their adoptions to finalize, along with the very moving ""Baby Mine"" track.

I have watched this film many times. It inspired me in my journey towards single motherhood. It sustained me during the long wait to adopt my daughter. Later, as a new mom, I watched it with my own mom -- who was then a first-time grandmother. It brought us both to tears.

Single motherhood by choice is a profound experience, full of longing and difficult choices. And as this film shows us, it can be done!",1205280000,5,1175,4.865
7913878,5,B00000JZID,"I am a single mother by choice. I took this video out of my local library. It's a really good movie to watch with your mother/parents if you want them to understand the dilemma facing a woman who is single, over 35, and hoping to have a child. The women in the video are smart, funny, attractive. Life has just not dealt them the proper marriage card.

If you're considering becoming a single mother by choice. I highly recommend the film. If you want to discuss this topic with your parents or friends, show them this video first.",1139616000,,531,4.418367346938775
