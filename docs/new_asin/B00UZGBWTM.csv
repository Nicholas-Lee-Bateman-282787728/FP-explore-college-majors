7072498,3,B00UZGBWTM,"I am so disappointed with the lack of response over my receiving an INcomplete order when I prepaid and received what was advertised as ""The Complete 7 Seasons.""  Season 6 had 21 Episodes total.  The set I received stops after Episode 18.  I purchased the set specifically to see Episode 19 - ""Cruel Deception,"" which is a special 2 hr show on one of the most notorious serial killers Mike DeBardeleben.  In fact, Episodes 20 and 21 are also 2 hr specials.  If these ""sets"" are not as advertised then I feel they should remove the word ""Complete"" and specify exactly how many Episodes are included, so we know what is missing and can make an informed decision about whether or not we wish to buy them.

7072499,4,B00UZGBWTM,"Great but there is no ""play all"" feature on the dvds...every..single..episode has to be selected to be played. It makes it very hard to binge watch.",1473897600,,148,4.730769230769231
7072500,5,B00UZGBWTM,"Before this great collection came out, I was really upset to learn you could order Season 1 - 4 from USA. The other three - you just couldn't.

I have always been a huge fan of this great series. After seeing it here in the UK on the quest channel. I really wanted to watch more.

I like to keep an eye on this great series in case any new versions released. Thankfully they did. They have released the whole collection together. Good price and from good USA sellers.

I really love this great FBI detective tv show.",1471478400,2,516,4.244897959183674
7072501,3,B00UZGBWTM,"An older series about different cases the FBI were involved in.
From a production quality standpoint it's a bit slow paced by today's standards and some errors with technical subjects.
Errors calling a Semi-automatic gun an AUTOMATIC gun, calling Magazines ""Clips"" and using BB guns as prop guns are a few issues.
Some episodes are all drug and gang related which I'm not really interested in, but if you haven't heard about the others cases it gives some insight into how they were solved.

Pacing, editing, and props are a few issues I'd point out, but most people probably won't notice these.

It's professionally produced in the 90's and done well for the time.

I do enjoy them and if you can get them on sale under $50 dollars they are worth adding to your DVD collection.",1470960000,2,778,4.664233576642336
7072502,4,B00UZGBWTM,Great show what more can I say,1470355200,,30,3.4285714285714284
7072503,5,B00UZGBWTM,"This was a gift but the feedback I received from the recipient would have to be 'rave' reviews. That person, a true crime afficianado,  was delighted (and still is) with this dvd set saying it is excellently done.",1465344000,,213,4.605263157894737
7072504,5,B00UZGBWTM,One of the most interesting and informative series I have ever seen.  Not much for modern television programs. Enjoy watching series like this.,1463184000,,143,5.217391304347826
7072505,5,B00UZGBWTM,"Very good, must have for fans of true crime.",1462924800,,44,4.0
7072506,3,B00UZGBWTM,"It should be mentioned that Jim Kallstrom's intros are missing from the episodes in this complete set (at least the ones I've watched so far), whereas they are present in the individual season sets (which are also better packaged). I thought his charmingly stiff no-nonsense readings added something to each episode. If he is no longer present in the episodes, Amazon should not list him in the credits. With that said, the show retains its  successful mix of interviews, demos, archival footage and re-enactments--which grow less awkward in later episodes. But it would have been nice for all parts to have been retained for those of us who remember those Discovery Channel days.",1453593600,11,680,5.017699115044247

8708807,5,B00UZGBWTM,"FBI Files - Love it! Really enjoy watching crime shows and this series has all that and more. I really enjoyed it when it was on tv and now I can watch each and every episode at my own leisure. Very fascinating finding out who did it and why and what happens to them in the end. It's like watching another whole world - the world of crime and watching it in the comfort of my home. It's intriguing to see why someone(s) would do this and/or that and for what ever reasons for doing it, what were they're motive.",1504569600,2,511,4.12
