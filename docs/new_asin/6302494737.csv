473238,2,6302494737,"Lost City was close to being Universal's last serial effort. It is not as dull as some of their other serial efforts but it is not very good either. Very noticeable is Universal's penchant for saving money by framing their serial plots around available stock shots. In Lost City the cliffhangers for chapters 2,3 and 4 were lifted from the 1943 Maria Montez-Jon Hall epic White Savage and many more ""liftings"" are prevelant in other chapters. If you want an exotic serial go with ""Drums of Fu Manchu"", one of Republic's finest.",1000684800,,527,4.739130434782608

I'm 72 years old, and I rember as a kid watching those movies on a circular TV or at the show.  It's difficult to say, but these are the kind of movies that make you feel young again.

7826657,4,6302494737,"This one is a 1946 Universal Studios serial. While it was enjoyable to watch it certainly wasn't up to the quality of a Republic Studios serial. What I enjoyed most about it was that its still available and the picture and sound quality is pretty good. Even in 2015 these serials are still important. They not only give us a glimpse of movie making and entertainment from decades past but they are, more importantly, a look at American Culture and morales and ethics, something that is missing in this country 69 years later.",1428710400,,525,4.655913978494624
7826658,4,6302494737,"It seems to me that this old movie serial has to have had an impact on Stephen Spielberg's RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC.  RAIDERS was very much a full blown movie version of a 1930s/40s movie serial and when I first saw is at age 13 I recognized all the inspirations from having adored watching LOST CITY OF THE JUNGLE on PBS on Saturdays when it was shown as part of a series called MATINEE AT THE BIJOU.  This is typical of the genre being produced on a budget with bad acting, but the outlandish adventure of it and the cliffhangers at the end of every episode is a lot of fun.  A lot of people wouldn't give this four stars because of the cheap production values and bad acting, but when you consider the typical production value and world of this genre, this series is one of the best of its kind.",1400889600,,797,4.196078431372549
7826659,5,6302494737,I had this on VHS and the quality was bad. Found this on Amazon and it is terrific.  Clear video and audio with captions.  Shipped quickly and packaged perfectly.,1357084800,,162,4.551724137931035
7826660,4,6302494737,"While Universal's reason for exiting the serial movie market is often misrepresented as a quality issue, and inability to compete with serials from Republic and Columbia, the decision seems to have had more to do with a change in company ownership, and a desire to focus on higher-end films.  That said, their next-to-last serial, ""Lost City of the Jungle"" has a number of problems, though it is better than might be expected from the circumstances of its production.

Lionel Atwill plays war monger Sir Eric Hazarias, who is after a rare element, ""Meteorium-245"" that provides a defense against the atomic bomb, which he hopes to sell since it would allow a country to engage in atomic warfare without fear of retaliation.  On the trail of Sir Eric is an agent of the United Peace Foundation, Rod Stanton (Russell Hayden) who, with difficulties including 'plane stowaway Marjorie Elmore (Jane Adams) flies across the Himalayas to Zalabar, capital of Pendrang, an isolated jungle province apparently near Hollywood.  There an archaeological dig is taking place by Ms. Elmore's father, Dr. Elmore (John Eldredge), whose activities are unwittingly helping Sir Eric who, under the assumed name of Geoffrey London, is financing the expedition because he believes it will uncover the ""Meteorium-245"" needed for his schemes.  Stanton meets up with co-agent Tal Shan (Keye Luke) and confirms Sir Eric's identity.  Discovering why Sir Eric is interested in the digs takes a little longer.  Adding further complications to both sides is the real power in Zalabar, a woman named Indra (Helen Bennett) who runs things from her casino, protecting those who pay for the service.

The serial was directed by the experienced team of Ray Taylor and Lewis D. Collins.  It shouldn't be a surprise that the plot is similar to that of the 1945 serial ""Secret Agent X-9"" since Universal had long been into recycling.  We have a casino owner in an isolated part of the world creating, for a profit, a neutral zone between the factions; the usual search for a miracle stuff by the bad guys, with the good guys trying to figure out what they're after and why; and the all-too-obvious ""secret agent"" types hanging about the casino.  It isn't even as believable as the earlier serial; for example no explanation is given as to why Indra has influence over the natives.  The plot had to be reworked when Lionel Atwill became seriously ill during production; he died the day before the official release date of the film.  Atwill had filmed scenes through the last chapter, but there were gaps, so Sir Eric's secretary, Malborn (John Miljan) became ""the real"" war monger.  Sometimes non-speaking views of Atwill's face are used along with a back view of a body double, but it doesn't work too well.  Universal was big on stock footage anyway, here using it for some of the cliffhangers, including clips from the avalanche rescue from the 1929 German film ""The White Hell of Pitz Palu,"" familiar from the third Flash Gordon serial.  The 1943 Universal film ""White Savage"" provided a couple more cliffhangers.  The acted out introductions do not help the pacing, since Universal thought it necessary to explain the many plot complications at the start of each chapter, which takes a couple minutes.  Acting is mostly to usual serial movie standards, with Russell Hayden a little bland as the hero, though Lionel Atwill did what he could, Keye Luke does his usual fine job as a sidekick, and there are some nice cameos, such as Frank Lackteen as the ""blind beggar"" outside the casino.  And despite the production problems, the plot holds together, if hardly a shining example of the form.

VCI's edition, # 8469 is on a single DVD.  The print used isn't bad, given what is often available from these old serials, but it is not ideal.  Some of the ""next week"" titles don't extend the full length of the music, and the final ""The End"" title finishes on a still frame, before the temple door in the background is fully closed.  I'm not sure it really hurts, but the last couple lines, where Ms. Elmore is questioned about her future plans are missing on this print.  Otherwise there are occasional splices, scratches and dirt but not to an annoying degree and some of it is from the stock footage; the temple destroyed by a ""remote controlled earthquake"" is shown in a still frame, with an especially nasty scratch in the original.  Brightness and contrast are good, the image well-framed and fairly sharp.  The ""night"" scenes are a bit dark but not totally black, and enough details can be seen with adjustment of brightness and contrast controls.  The sound is clear enough for the extensive dialogue to be understood but with a little noise, some distortion and limited frequency range, suggesting more than the image quality that this is from a 16mm reduction print.  There is some obvious flutter in Chapter Six, and wow at the start of the opening credits, worse in some chapters but all from the same piece of film with a splice as the credit for John Miljan scrolls up in ""The Players"" list from the bottom of the screen.

The ""extras"" include the original two-minute trailer for ""Lost City of the Jungle"" and one running about three and a half minutes for the 1951 Columbia serial ""Captain Video"" including some color-tinted scenes.  There are also ""Bios"" of Russell Hayden, Jane Adams, Lionel Atwill, Lewis D. Collins and Ray Taylor.  After the FBI warning at the start of the disc there are some clips used as advertising for other serials available from VCI.

More than with most serials, this one shouldn't be watched without at least a day between chapters to forget some of the redundant plot explanations, but otherwise it isn't bad for a post-war serial; the story itself moves along fairly well.  VCI's print isn't perfect, but the defects are fairly minor, and at the price, a reasonable value.",1301184000,,5878,4.857715430861724
7826661,5,6302494737,"What a tremendous bargain some of these old black-and-white serial films are -- this one is exceptionally so.

THE STORY: An evil perpetrator oversees the secret mining of Meteorium 245 within the mythical realm of Pendrang, a jungle paradise located deep within the Himalayan Mountains, a kingdom which is ruled by a shrewd and beautiful queen, (and an imaginative location idea possibly seized from the terrific 1937 film:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Horizon/dp/6305416222/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Horizon</a>.) This rare element provides the basis for a defense against the atomic bomb [!] which, when the device is perfect, will be sold to a rogue nation. The good guys (against impossible odds!) fly into Pendrang and do battle with the criminal spies who, by the way, are coercing an unwilling old scientist to develop the valuable Meteorium weapon.

The chief assets of this 1946 film include the great sets, atmospheric locations, and terrific props... jungles, secret caves, cool old aircraft, and so on. A second big ace stems from the fact that this serial stars the renowned Lionel Atwill (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Holmes-The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/dp/B0001DCYBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Holmes - The Hound of the Baskervilles</a>) who sadly died of pneumonia during this filming. George Sorel, (a man who almost always went uncredited in the one hundred or so films in which he played!), filled in for most of Atwill's subsequent scenes. While he had played numerous roles on both sides of the fence, Atwill was always at his best when depicting a dark adversarial figure, a role which he artfully conveys in this instance.

This film also stars ""Lucky"" Russell Hayden who, throughout his career, almost universally starred in either B-western films or television western episodes, for example:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gene-Autry-Valley-of-Fire/dp/B0006QAIDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gene Autry - Valley of Fire</a>. Another B-western film great, Pierce Lyden, plays a constable here and went uncredited for his minor role. I personally knew Pierce, a really terrific fellow who contributed a great deal to the B-western movies over the years. ""Lost City of the Jungle"" was directed by Lewis D. Collins and Ray Taylor.

This late-period cliffhanger serial boasts 13 terrific chapters and runs for over four hours (247 minutes) on a single DVD. The DVD transfer (VCI Entertainment) worked out nicely and the visual quality is excellent, as is the sound. Here are the chapter titles:

-- Himalaya Horror
-- The Death Flood
-- Wave Length for Doom
-- The Pit of Pendrang
-- Fiery Danger
-- Death's Shining Face
-- Speedboat Missing
-- Fire Jet Torture
-- Zalabar Death Watch
-- Booby Trap Rendezvous
-- Pendrang Guillotine
-- Jungle Smash-Up
-- Atomic Vengeance

The advantage of watching serial films is that the good ones never drag -- and there's plenty of action in this one. If you love ""jungle serials"" as I do, then you'll also want to see:

7826662,3,6302494737,"When I was a kid, I spent my Saturday afternoons at the now long departed Roycroft Theater in Seattle, watching a shoot-'em-up movie, cartoons and, most importantly, the latest exciting chapter of a cliff-hanger serial.

I outgrew those 13-chapter, low-budget actioners years ago, but some of them have remained etched in my memory.  One of the most vivid is LOST CITY OF THE JUNGLE (1946), which is, in fact, the first serial I ever saw.

I must have been five or six years old when I saw that one, so when VCI Entertainment released it onto DVD, nostalgia made me want to revisit those innocent moments of my youth.

Set following World War II, the story (such as it is) centers around super villain Lionel Atwill, who wants to get his hands on a rare substance that is located in a lost city, somewhere in the jungles of the Himalayas.  This substance will neutralize the atomic bomb and allow Atwill to rule the world.  Secret agents Russell Hayden and Keye Luke, working for the United Peace Foundation, are assigned to stop him.

As in all good serials, our heroes are threatened (at the end of each chapter) with landslides, earthquakes and other terrible threats that they miraculously survive at the beginning of the following chapter.

Even though the dialogue and the acting in LOST CITY OF THE JUNGLE leave much to be desired, these 13-chapters are still fun to watch.

What's really interesting is to see how the writers were able to write around Atwill's lead villain character, because the actor died midway through the filming.

Ray Taylor and Lewis D. Collins directed LOST CITY OF THE JUNGLE, which co-stars Jane Adams.
