917260,5,630450733X,"The Wizard is such a memorable nostalgic movie from the 80's. Came out in the perfect time when Nintendo was in the height of its popularity. Died off real quick at the box office since the prime movie goer that went and saw it was more interested in the Nintendo games the movie showed throughout and the competition in the finale with Super Mario Bros. 3. No one cared about the story, which itself is pretty good. All in all, its a fun movie.

Universal's DVD release was a decent one. Great wide screen transfer and decent audio, but no extras. Bummer, but at least it got a DVD release with no full screen format. Now that Shout Factory has had plenty of experience taking many Universal movies and giving them outstanding Collector's Edition treatments on Blu-Ray, why not do it for this one? Should've done it in 2014 for its 25th anniversary. Would be nice to see retro interviews with the cast and crew and their recollections on this movie. The reaction to seeing Super Mario Bros. 3 for the first time.

Overall, great movie from the past, and here's hoping that Shout Factory will get this movie added to their ever growing Blu-Ray Collector's Edition set.",1453593600,,1168,4.610576923076923

They giggled here and there, but they are fairly little, about the age I was when I saw this film.

We got on the topic of Nintendo and how great the system was when it was introduced to the US in 1985 and suddenly the thought of seeing this movie again seemed like it would be fun what with the actual game footage and the famous Power Glove scene. Unfortunately I was wrong. This movie may have been great in 1990 but it is just bad now. It is horribly outdated and cheesy in the worst regard.

918772,3,630450733X,"The truth is, I only watched the Wizard last night because a few months ago I found out it shows footage of Super Mario Bros. 3 just before the games release in the United States.  Really unfortunate that I wasn't able to see the Wizard when it was brand new and my fellow video gamers were obsessing over it.  I believe my gaming obsession got underway in 1989 when this movie just came out and back then would have been a PERFECT opportunity to watch it.  Oh well.  I had no idea of its existence at the time, however (despite being a big Fred Savage fan thanks to the Wonder Years).

Anyway, all the games you see featured in the movie are ones that most of us at the time have played before.  Double Dragon, Rad Racer, the Little Mermaid, the American version of Super Mario Bros. 2... these are all games that I've played countless times (and would go on to have better sequels in my opinion).

Anyway, why only the 3-star rating?  It's honestly not much of a movie.  Average at best.  Fred Savage's character has a friend who's a wizard with video games- completely unstoppable with a controller in his hands and awaiting the chance to compete with other experienced video gamers.  So when it's discovered they don't have enough money to travel to their destination, these two meet up with a girl and basically hitchhike out in the desert to the video game competition.  Along the way they find themselves mingling with other kids who happen to be better at video games than the wizard himself.  The one kid who takes out the mighty power glove is pretty funny.  You see back then we really *did* think that thing was powerful!

So... guess what game it is that makes up the final round of the competition?  Yup, you probably guessed correctly- the one, the only, the legendary... Super Mario Bros. 3!  Supposely this movie helped play a part in exciting video gamers even MORE over the release of this game.  The hype for it was really huge in the late 80's and now we know why- SMB3 has become the best NES game of all-time, and maybe even in the top 5 games ever made.  So yeah, this is sort of a big deal.

It must have been awesome to watch the Wizard as a youngster while anticipating the release of SMB3.  Actually it's hard to believe there was a time when this game wasn't yet a part of our American lives!  I recommend skipping to the end of the movie for the 3-minute segment showing SMB3 and ignore all the other unmemorable bits that make up the rest of the movie.  It doesn't really tell an enticing storyline.",1358899200,,2530,4.416846652267819

This movie is just awesome if you grew up in the days when Nintendo's NES dominated the videogame world. It has nods to everything you loved about gaming and a goofy story that will leave you facepalming in happiness.

I don't want to spoil it for anyone interested so I will just give a basic rundown.

1. Weird kid's sister dies.  Only older brother (Fred Freakin' Savage) seems to give a crap.

2. Weird kid decides to go to California, Fred goes with him. Mom hires a bounty hunter to get them, dad and older brother take a trip to try and get the kids back before the bounty hunter does.

3. Weird kid is like, a gaming savant and somehow scores 50000 points on Double Dragon in minutes just playing the demo screen.

4. They meet a girl. Did you know that nowadays she fronts a rock band? And she got hot. I used to think she was Andi from Goonies, but I was wrong.

5. Video game training montage after meeting Lucas, the jerkass kid that has all the NES games.

6. Video Game Stuff

7. Family Stuff.

8. SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3 FIRST REVEAL!

9. Family stuff

10. The end

It felt like it was really made for my generation, those of us who grew up on 80's music and Nintendo games.  Beyond that, it's basically every kid's fantasy adventure.  A wild road trip across the land with no adults telling you what to do or where to go, all for the sake of getting rich by playing Nintendo.  What child could ever ask for more?

But it also deals with some very serious issues, such as broken up families, mental illness, and personal loss.  On top of that, the music is great, the games are geat, and the setting is great.  These are some key reasons it still holds up well even by today's standards, and every time I turn this on, I'm in nostalgia heaven.

Now of course this does require some suspension of disbelief, mainly because these kids manage to travel hundreds of miles across multiple states by hitching rides with strangers who never once question why they are traveling with no parents.  But who cares?  It's still a blast that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.

918781,4,630450733X,"The Wizard(1989), directed by Todd Holland, is a fun, cheesy family movie from the late 1980's. Siskel and Ebert called it ""one of the worst movies of 1989"", but it's really not that bad. It is a commercial for Nintendo and Universal Studios, but it also delivers in showmanship. Jimmy(Luke Edwards) suffers from a mental disorder after his twin sister dies. His brother Corey(Fred Savage) takes him to California to compete in Video Armageddon. This is where the Nintendo game Super Mario Bros. 3 was introduced in the United States of America. Jenny Lewis plays a girl who helps Corey and Jimmy get to California for a share of the prize money. The adult Lewis is a member of a country-rock band.  Frank McRae, Beau Bridges, and Christian Slater co-star.
 I remember watching TV spots for The Wizard during Christmas Vacation of 1989. I didn't get a chance to watch the film until it was shown on CBS. I remember toy stores in 1990 that had countless advertisements for Super Mario Bros. 3. On their window was a giant poster of Mario with a fox tail! This film jumped on the bandwagon at the right time. 1984's Cloak and Dagger was a Hitchcockian suspense-thriller...and a commercial for Atari! In that film, Dabney Coleman had a gadget that neatly put his parachute in his backpack! I wonder if there was an homage to that in Star Trek(2009)? The Angry Video Game Nerd and The Nostalgia Critic have already given us their opinions about the film on the web. The Wizard did spawn Wizard Reunions in Texas.

""THE WIZARD"" isn't any new moniker or fun new twist on the classic story of a little girl from Kansas who gets caught in a tornado and finds herself not only over the rainbow, but in a wonderland of Technicolor and strange characters.

Well, at least not exactly.

This ""Wizard"" dealt with kids in peril, feeling trapped where they were. Video games were their outlet. One boy so disturbed, he became mute and later committed after witnessing the death of his sister. The older brothers living with the father after the divorce. When a child is lost, a family is too.

""The Wizard"" open with a small, determined soul walking along a long stretch of road in the pursuit of something. Some goal, some destination. Some form of escape.

There's something... he's looking for. He's on his way... somewhere. Somewhere special, somewhere important. Somewhere he needs to be. It fades in like a sunrise... where is he going? We don't know. This boy's name is Jimmy. And he has a goal. He tells us, ""California...""

Jimmy, in a major institution, yet breaking loose again and again like the family cat. One day during a visit, big brother Corey takes little Jimmy and the two break loose--together. At an arcade, Corey first-hand witnesses Jimmy is Bobby Fisher's predecessor at Nintendo. They use his skills to play for money. And because it's a road trip movie, they have to pick up a woman along the way.

It's a PG flick for little kids (once again, Nintendo fans), so it has to a preteen like them--and they have to be just friend. Her name is Haley, an adolescent drifter. She claims to know the score... and she can raise the money to get them where they need to go.

And Halley is one sizzling hustler. Wait 'til she's old enough to develop sex appeal to add to the mix.

It was my mother who recalled that old song from the ""He's A Pinball Wizard"" by The Who and suggested maybe that's where the movie got its namesake. The little ditty of some soul who was a wonder at that one arcade game. It was his world. Whoever he was. Well, if anyone could relate to that...

'Would've liked to hear that on the soundtrack at maybe some point.

A lot of the world said that the ""Wizard"" is stuffed to the gills with commercials. But no, they were wrong. ""The Wizard"" WAS a commercial. For Nintendo and Universal.

If we'd gotten scenes where we see Jimmy's connection to these games, how he becomes Zen, there might have actually been some real significance. We're just watching video games being played. And... that's all we as kids wanted from ""The Wizard.""

No really powerful piece of cinema, but to just see kids like us running loose without parental supervision and Nintendo being our source of rebellion. Children as resourceful as can be doing incredible things with the toys we played with and loved.

Screenwriter/producer David Chisholm seems to have cobbled this together out of spare plot threads and gimmicks. Usually filmmakers do this when they're just doing the obligated rush hatchet job and don't have their heart in the project they're working on. And you can tell--Chisholm doesn't love this screenplay of his. This is no personal project for him. This is just a Hollywood crowd-pleaser designed to feed the cult masses.

The choir (us) loves video games, lives for them, thrives on them. But the makers of this movie don't. They don't care about any of this except--""Here, buy this. Spend your money on...""

For all of those who belonged to the mass cult of Nintendo, this was the third coming.

Seeing it again now with older, more experienced eyes... like an old man going back into his childhood home, the bedroom we once lived in, the bed once ours, looking over our own toys and photos... and, and... what the hell was I thinking? Was that even me? Who was that?

What is ""Wizard""? A film of our adoration for Nintendo from our childhood, which weaved together our love of movies featuring us kids as the heroes and our undying love of the video games.

... Jesus, what were we thinking?

Fred Savage stands as one of the finest child actors there ever was. The Savage was just that--even better. And Luke Edwards is all right for what this role calls for--acting terminally shy at all times.

For a movie about the kids and their toys, ""The Wizard"" holds some surprisingly good adult performances. Steven Grives as the electrified Video Armageddon Announcer who's like a British Christopher Lloyd as the charged-up Master of Ceremonies. And Will Seltzer as one scummy bounty hunter who tracks down runaways.

Beau Bridges, commendable. Christian Slater himself, a fine actor, very fine. Like fine china. And he's given virtually nothing to do in his ""eldest brother"" role.

Hey, the kids don't care about Bridges or Christian Slater--they care about Nintendo. Well, there's not much Nintendo either.

For some reason, after seeing ""The Wizard"" again with older eyes, I just somehow didn't feel like video games for the time being. I wanted to get out and physically do something. Take some real action with my life. It was a few days before I picked up a Game Boy.

As I was playing my usual ""Tetris"" round and trying to break my old record, I was singing quietly to myself, ""He's A Nintendo Wizard...""

Damn Nintendo can you shill your products even harder. Mario 3 is what Halo and GTA are today. Mario was the man, and seeing his latest game on the big screen. As a kid I could have died right there in my seat. Now it seems like the review is for Mario 3 and not the movie. This is actually a very good family movie. Kids on the running ditching the man.

It is a commercial for Nintendo but in a way it's not, or not any different than coca cola having product placement throughout a film. There's just not that much NES involved in the film.

919047,5,630450733X,"""The Wizard"" is somewhat of a cult 80's movie that is fantastic to watch. Actually, I should qualify that. The movie is dated. I think even for '89 it was terribly dated. But if you were a child of the 80's then you could certainly relate to this movie and you will appreciate everything it stands for.

""The Wizard"" stars The Wonder Years star, Fred Savage as Corey Woods. Corey is trying to save his younger brother from being institutionalized. Luke Edwards plays The Wizard, aka Jimmy Woods; an emotionally crippled little boy who has trouble articulating his thoughts.

The first 10 or 15 minutes of the movie are somewhat slow-moving. But it really picks up once Corey and Jimmy hit the road and meet Haley. Eighties tween-movie maven, Jenny Lewis plays the part of the very grown-up Haley extraordinarily. They all finally come up with a plan once they see Jimmy ace a video game at a bus station.

So, Jimmy, Haley and Corey all set out to hitch across 3 states (UT and NV) to make it to the video game championships (in CA.) I know this is a little far-fetched and maybe even a little screw-ballish. But think of it from a kid's perspective (after all this is a kid's movie.) Along the way, they have a few adventures in Reno while Jimmy bones up on his gaming. They also have to dodge Tate. Vince Trankina plays Tate, a smarmy detective hired by Jimmy's parents to track him down. It was so funny when Haley screamed, ""he touched my breasts"" and the security men all carry him out of the casino before he could run off with Jimmy!

They all finally make it to CA, with the help of a trucker that Haley has befriended. Once at the championships, Corey's father and brother also show up looking for them (Christian Slater played Nick & Beau Bridges played Sam Woods.) It gets a little confusing, Jimmy is Corey and Nick's half-brother from Sam's second marriage to Jimmy's mother. It's a shame Christian Slater's part wasn't any bigger because he played a really good tough older brother.

As a kid, my favorite scenes were during the video game tournament. Because, it was the first time I ever saw Super Mario Bros. 3. Eighteen years later, compared to even the most basic games it's like watching an antiquated dinosaur; but it's still fun to watch because it brings back fond memories.

Anyway, the rest of the movie is pretty much predictable. There was a cute moment at the end when it was explained why Jimmy really wanted to go to California in the first place. Also, it loosely made viewers think that Haley was going to live with Corey and his father; at least that was the impression that I got.

""The Wizard"" is a great picture for kids because there isn't any violence or profane language. I also recommend this movie to anyone that likes classic video games or to anyone that just likes corny 80's films.

The Wizard is not the movie about Dorothy and the dwarves, nor is it the movie about Diana Ross and Michael Jackson singing and whooping it up as they go down the yellow block road.  It is, instead, a movie about Fred Savage, his goofy little challenged brother, and an awesome Nintendo championship.

This movie pits David against Goliath, in an Orwellian-like fantasyland with Power Gloves, road trips, and the comic stylings of Beau Bridges.  But at its heart, this movie is about brotherly love and how fun is it that Fred Savage (who we all adored as the lil' brother on The Wonder Years Show) now gets to turn the tables and be the older brother.  Now that is some acting!

As his goofy little brother pines away for California, you'll be pining away for more gritty and romp-filled scenes, and you will get them in spades!  This is not just a movie about Nintendo, but really about the triumph of the human spirit (over Luigi and Princess Toadstool).

They have made many movies about Nintendo championships, but this one puts it in a historical context that in no way feels dated today.  It is kind of a life-changing film, and if you see it you will probably hate every other movie you've seen before it and every one you have yet to see in your future.

919149,4,630450733X,"Now a days you can't go anywhere without hearing of some new video game system coming out. Long lines out the door in the hopes to get one of the latest generation video game systems or the various games that are available on said system.

Back in 1989, things weren't too differnet. The graphics may not have been up to today's standards but there was one king on the block that everyone had to know. That was Nintendo. The 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System was a must have for kids young and old alike. With games varying from sports, action and adventure this was the must have system of the late 1980's and early 1990's.

This movie, pretty much takes a look at life when focused on a young boy, Jimmy and his natural talent dealing with  the Nintendo Entertainment System. He is a natural wiz at any and all games, yet doesn't speak much except for exclaiming his desire to go to ""California"". Fred Savage as Corey, sets out on an adventure with his half brother Jimmy in what seems like a quest to California to compete in the Video Game Championships at Universal Studios.

Along the way they meet up with Haley, played by Jenny Lewis, who becomes their female compainon in their quest to reach California and get out of trouble that they happen to get into as they avoid the parents and the bounty hunter who are all after the boys who left without permission on this quest to reach the video game tournement.

The movie has a very 1980's feel to it. It comes off as an advertisement of sorts for all things Nintendo. You have the use of the ill fated ""Power Glove"" that one of the kids rivals who will be at said tournement uses while they challenge him in his home town on the way to California. There is even a point where Haley is on the phone with the ""Nintendo Game Councelors"" getting much needed help on every and any game for the NES. Of course not telling us watchers of this movie how much that really would have costs as most people knew it was not a free service as they were showing in the movie.  Also while on the phone the names of various popular games are being mentioned left and right, a lot of the games not possibly ever going to be used in the tournament as they are RPG in nature. There was even one point where Corey's father and brother (played by Beau Bridges and Christian Slater) have to get their car fixed and pop out a NES to play on a small TV in the repair garage. It was moments like this that dumbed down the movie a bit. What could have been great, really comes off as a dated commercial for how wonderful the NES is and how even adults use it and get a kick out of it.

The biggest and probably main draw of the movie, was the fact that it proudly displayed a long awaited game at this time ""Super Mario Bros 3"" which was not even out in game stores at the time this movie was in theaters. I won't give away the details surrounding the use of this game, but it was a real reason that people ran out to see this movie. As the Super Mario craze was alive and well at this time and just for the sight of  the next edition of the long running Mario saga, was a reason that most Nintendo fans had to see this film. Yours truly included. That thrill of seeing the game used in this movie is probably not as big a deal now with the game already out for so many years and in differnet editions but if you can take yourself back to this time period and put the advertisement factors aside, you will see why this is a cool moment in the film.

Advertisements aside, the movie is a blast to watch again. It comes off as a great piece of pure nostalgia. Remembering a time when things were easy and simplistic yet still fun. A lot of people who were in their teen's when this movie came out all probably wished that they were stars in such things as a video game competition. This movie really plays up on the idea of going cross country just to prove one's worth in said tourny, but also shows that the kids who were the focus, were more then just video game crazed kids wanting to show off their skills. We learn towards the end that there really was other goals then just video games behind the whole film. So what turns out to be a kid just wanting to win a video game championship turns out to be about much more. Again not the deepest of moments but at least they did try to make the story more then just being to play video games and nothing else.

Over all, this film comes off as a weird mixture of ""Over the Top"", ""The Fugitive"" and ""The Goonies"" sponsored by Nintendo. It should also be noted that Universal who made this film, decides to get in on the advertising in the movie as well of their own brand, proudly showing various characters and locations in Universal Studios, California where the tournament takes place. Once you get past all the ads within, you will find a fun and enjoyable film that I think all in the family should enjoy. It's not the most creative or deepest of stories ever seen in a movie, but it is fun and you start to root for the kids and get involved in the situation you find yourself in as if you too were on a similar quest to just accomplish something and to have your parents understand what you are going through.

It's a fun watch and a great trip down memory lane. The NES may be a memory now, but this is one trip down memory lane you won't be sorry getting. And of course like most 1980's movies, everything works out happily ever after in this story, and we wouldn't have it any other way. Check it out.

919152,3,630450733X,"The Wizard is basically Rain Man with Kids and video games. It's also basically just a 2 hour advertisement for Nintendo. It's still fairly entertaining though and not a bad film for the whole family. Fred Savage plays a kid who runs away with his mentally unstable brother. Instead of being good at gambling in Las Vegas though like Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, he's a video game genius. So they plan on heading to a video game tournerment. The big game to play is the new Mario Brothers game that was just coming out at that time. I think it was Mario Brothers 3.

  The film was hated by critics of course but it's pretty harmless. I remember thinking that two of the better performances in the movie came from Beau Bridges as the father and Christian Slater as the older brother who travel to find them and bond in the process. I'm not sure if it would entertain me now as much as it did as a kid but I don't see why kids of today wouldn't like it.",1160438400,,951,4.2430939226519335

The movie quality was very good, and it was widescreen so you know it will be just like you remember it.  It looked very nice running on both S-Video and Component (I tried both) on my LCD TV.  Crystal Clear!  The sound also was clear, but is not enhanced in any way for Surround, Dolby, or anything.

The DVD itself is lacking.  The case is nice, but the DVD menus are horrible.  In reality they don't exist.  There are two options on the main screen; Play Movie and Languages.  That's it.  No Extras, Commentary, or even Scene Selection.  The movie is divided into different scenes (you can jump around by navigating forward and back as usual with your remote buttons) but there is no menu option to flip through them.  This makes it hard to skip to your favorite scenes, like the one with the Power Glove.

As for the Language option there is one choice; English subtitles for the hearing impaired.  That's it.  I though at least they would have French and Spanish subs, if not Spanish dubs.  Nope.

If you love the movie like me get it.  You may have a hard time finding it like I did (went to four stores) but its worth it so long as all you want to do is watch the movie.  I was very disappointed that there were no extras, but not making a scene selection is just bad form.  I know fans that could have, and would have, done a better job of putting the whole package together.  At least the movie is high quality.",1156291200,5,1510,4.242957746478873

If that is true...... you know what? I DONT CARE!!! I loved this movie as a kid and I still do today. Hey the average game player's age today is 25 years old. Video games are not just for kids anymore.

This movie is basically about a family that is experiencing many problems: divorce, a death in the family, family communication problems, and a special needs child (Jimmy). Due to all of these family problems, Jimmy, the little boy in the movie with the special needs, is put into an institution against the wishes of his older brother Cory (Fred Savage). From there the adventure begins. Corey breaks his brother out of the institution and heads for California. Along the way, he finds out his brother has a gift.... he's a genius when it comes to video games.

Thats all I want to really say about the movie. I don't want to totally spoil it for you if you haven't watched it yet. This is a great family film. It can be watched by all ages. I already had it on VHS however now I have it on DVD. If you or your kids love video games too, you should own this also.

Corey played by Fred Savage is his older brother that kidnaps him, so he can be free from the institution he was being placed in. Along the way Corey and Jimmy meet Hailey. Hailey is from Reno the biggest little city and lives basically alone because her dad is a trucker. The three of them form a bond, that leads them all the way to Video Armaggedon which is the first time Super Mario Bros. 3 is released for the world to see. And on the way they face a crazy cop, bullies, lack of money, and so much more. This is a movie that I would wake up and put in the VCR every Saturday morning that I could. It's a tale that many people who are classic gamers would enjoy and also kids and pre-teens. The film some say is a bit cheesy and juvenile but for anyone that had NES in their youth it's completely worth it...For everyone who spent endless hours trying to beat Shredder in TMNT...Thought that Double Dragon was the ultimate game...

When Corey learns that Jimmy may get taken to a home for kids with special needs, he kidnaps his brother and the two go on an adventure to California. Of course, they come across the evil goon that their mother has hired to bring them back and countless thugs who don't like losing their hard-earned money in a Nintendo hustle. But that's nothing compared to Jimmy's cocky arch nemesis, Lucas, the flamboyant Apollo Creed to Jimmy's Rocky Balboa who owns every Nintendo game in existence as well as the unstoppable Power Glove accessory that allows him to make short work of his opposition.
""The Wizard"" is about as shameless as commercial films get but it is entertaining. Having the top male TV heart throb in a movie that pretty much advertises every Nintendo game ever made at the time is sure to make a nice amount of bank. Throwing in Christian Slater wasn't a bad touch either. This ranks right up there with ""True Romance"" as his finest performance.

I love watching Jimmy (Edwards) practice in the arcade in Reno to get ready for Video Armageddon.  I wish arcades where still big today, but I still like to go to them anyway.  The movie stars Fred Savage (wonder years) who plays Jimmy's half brother.  They go across the southwest to get to the video championships in L.A.  Another great thing about this movie is where it was made, Universal Studios.  I have visited Universal Studios and rode the tram where the chase scene happens near the end.  I love going through Universal Studios and looking at the building where Video Amrageddon was held.

919508,5,630450733X,"Total nostalgia for old skool Nintendo gamers like myself.
Like Cher, I wish I could turn back time :) It was great
to be a NES gamer ( still is ) especially back in the
mid '80s. I was about 12 yrs when my parents bought
me a Nintendo system ( I still own it and it works ).
Every game that was hard-earned I played-to-death!
Y'all remember The Legend of Zelda, right?
Man, that brings tears to my eyes!
I was lost in the world of Nintendo.
Later, I hear about a movie coming out -- its was called
""The Wizard"". It had big name child actor at the time ( Fred )
and it featured many gaming products by Nintendo. I was like,
""Cool!"" But what really got me all hyped-up about this movie
was a sneak preview of Miyamoto-san's SUPER MARIO BROS 3!
Having gone through Super Mario 2 the previous year --
I could care less how bad of a film ""The Wizard""
could be. Just as long as I got see MARIO 3!
When the film came out -- I grabbed my best
Nintendo crazed friend to go see it. We got
our special edition ""Pocket Power"" mini-mag
at the ticket booth :) 2-hours later -- we caught
another showing :) It was great to see Mario coming back!
Btw, the movie itself wasn't all that bad if you
didn't care for a simple plot. The following year,
I took part in the 1990 Nintendo World Championships at
Universal Studios, California -- sorta like the movie.
I ended up in the simi-finals -- though I lost :(
But it was another great experience. I gave the 5 stars
simply cause of a decent '80s flick and  Nintendo's
clever way of marketing its products in a film.
It certainly worked for me and my friend. Hopefully,
one day ""The Wizard"" gets DVD treatment
in the U.S. Eversince, I CAN'T STAND VHS and Pan & Scan!!!!!",1018310400,,1702,4.173252279635259
919509,5,630450733X,"This movie was really a testament to Nintendo's supremacy in the late 80's with the NES.  Basically, it stands as the single greatest marketing technique in the realm of video games.  A motion picture aimed to advertise not only great hits of the NES, but a brand new game, Super Mario Bros 3.
The movie tries hard to make use think that video games were the cool thing to be into, going so far as old business men playing it on break, and little Nintendo gangs that sit around and play Nintendo all day and keep their trusty Power Glove in a box that looks like it should be holding a Nuclear Launch Panel rather than a toy.
The story is basically a trip to reconcile the past, and to figure out who you really are.  Whether it bet the middle brother in torn family, a roadie girl without a real family, or an emotionally disturbed boy who is looking for an outlet for his pain.  Though the film itself is far from being realistic, (I mean three young kids traveling along the highway from Utah to California?), it defintely is a keepsake for classic gamers from that era.
Besides, the ending is pretty cool, getting to see Super Mario Bros 3 being played at a huge contest (which in real life was called PowerFest and DID happen) at Universal Studios, it was quite a treat.  However, hardcore gamers will be quick to point out several faults in the gaming aspect of the movie, such as games playing by themselves and the Power Glove making sounds when you pressed the button that it didn't.
All in all, it's not in print anymore, you might as well try to get it while you can.  If you are German, pick up the DVD under the title ""Joystick Heroes"".",1014854400,,1649,4.372549019607843
919510,4,630450733X,"This is a pretty good movie - my copy at home is wearing out becasue ive see in so many times.  The reason I give it four stars is because at the end when hes playing the brand new video game and Haley says ""thats the magic flute. Use it, use it, it opens the warp!""  How could she know that?  But anyway...
To the person below me:  Haley says ""there is no way; I am NOT kissing a boy,"".  She just sort of molds two sentences together; her tone of voice changes.  Sure, Im sounding technical, but hey I memorized this movie too.  I even like the music.

(Nick) ""I Cant believe it i cant even Speak to my own father mr. cheap skate gets us a room that doesnt have double bed!"" That had to be my favorite line in the movie cracks me up. I also liked jenny lewis who plays haley she's cool i think she messed up on her line when her and fred were up on her roof of the house when fred tryed to kiss her and she said:""i know what you were trying to do and you can just forget about it! there is no way that im NOT kissing a boy"" i don't think she was supposted to say that. but mistakes happen. and you will noice that when
you see the part where lucas is playing ""Rad Racer"" on the NES who wears the power glove you will see he isn't really playing with the glove. one of the kids are controlling it to seem like lucas is playing with the power glove but he moves his glove the same as the car in the game. Putnum was a good char. in the movie him and woods would battle it through the whole movie. The boy that was in the arcade when putnum asked him he was looking for a couple of kids and he says ""this ones a Mintal case have you seen him?"" the boy says ""does he dress like you?"" (No) he says ""than he couldn't be much of a case alright?"".To the parents who want to buy this movie for a son or daugher or even a grandson of the family BE WARNED that this movie has some language not for kids.overall its a really great piece of work the actors did a good job jimmy doesnt say much. only lines: ""corey i don't want to quit!"", ""please spankey?"", ""Califorina!"", ""Jennifer!""

I remember back when I was 11 years old that I read rumors about this movie in 'Nintendo Power' gaming magazines, and I couldn't wait to see it. I remember kissing the display that held the movie poster in the local mall  when it finally was on it's way out. I remember clutching the tiny 'Pocket  Power' magazine that was being handed out at the movie theatre on opening  day (I might even still have it), and I remember going nuts trying to  figure out how Jimmy got that warp whistle when I finally got my copy of  Super Mario 3.
Good nostalga to show to children who were raised on  N64's and playstations. It'll show them how video games REALLY were. The  movie's story was decent, and I played the hillarious 'Demolition Derby'  scene between Jimmy's dad and Putnam over and over and over again!

But the other big reason I loved this movie is because I  identified with Jimmy, the autistic kid who goes on to become the video  game champion. I was diagnosed as being autistic (wrongly, but still...)  because I'm so quiet like Jimmy. This movie proves to me that the little  quiet kid can triumph over the older punk who ""has all 88 games.""  Sadly, Lucas Edwards (Jimmy) is now on MTV's Undressed. Is nothing sacred?  This movie gives you anything you want. There are scenes of action (Beau  Bridges getting into fights with the cop searching for the kids), humor  (Jimmy and Corey hiding in the back of a Hostess cupcake van), terror (when  those farmers find them in the back of their truck with the pigs), and the  first time we hear Jimmy speak, when he's looking at a map of the US saying  ""California... California...""

Now, I realize the film is  considerably dated and quite a bit cheesy, but I love it just the same.
