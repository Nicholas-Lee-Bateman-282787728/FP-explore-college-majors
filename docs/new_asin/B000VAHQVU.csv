When she moved, come Christmas she realized that she would not be watching the movies. When I found this collection, I quickly ordered it and sent it to her. All movies are full of fun, laughter, and some occurances that just comes with the season family dynamics, money woes, planning and dreaming of the perfect Christmas. Even a new love. Get this collection, make some hot chocolate and cookies, settle in and be prepared to be entertained!",1397520000,2,597,4.805825242718447

2934295,5,B000VAHQVU,"If it included ""Ernest Saves Christmas"" it would be perfect.  As it stands, it is merely wonderful!  ;-)  The film rendition of Jean Shepherd's ""A Christmas Story"" alone makes it worth the price of the collection, to me.  Then the addition of ""elf"" and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation are high value-add bonuses.  Again, if only it included ""Ernest Saves Christmas"" (available separately) it would be perfect as a collection of Recent/Modern light-hearted Christmas tales.  As it is offered, it is merely wonderful!  ;-)",1392249600,,526,5.265060240963855

2934308,3,B000VAHQVU,"Elf was entertaining if not a bit predictable.  Very much enjoyed ""A Christmas Story.""  National Lampoons Christmas was a disappointment due to some inappropriate scenes for a ""family movie"" and for not being very funny most of the time.

2934317,5,B000VAHQVU,"My husband was dying, well almost, to watch A Christmas Story with our kids.  I usually get movies like this from the library, but his notice was late and the movie was spoken for well past Christmas so I went shopping.  I gave it to him and the kids as an early gift and it was a major hit.  He watched A Christmas Story more than the kids did, and Elf was on a continuous loop for at least a couple of days.  Christmas Vacation was on Netflix, so it wasn't quite as exotic, but still much appreciated since it is one of my husband's all time favorites.  The only bad thing was it arrived a day later than expected, but still in plenty of time for maximum Christmas enjoyment.",1388707200,,677,4.176923076923077

2934332,5,B000VAHQVU,"My family doesn't have a television with channels. We only have a TV that plays DVDs. One thing I miss about not having channels is all of the awesome family-friendly Christmas shows that are played near the holiday season. So this year I went around and bought a bunch of Christmas DVDs. This set caught my eye right away and I snatched it up. I love comedy. I love Christmas. I love all three of these movies. And yes- you get ALL three! Each on their own DVD. Each in their own thin DVD case. All three of the cases fit nicely into the original box.

The first DVD (and my personal favorite) that we watched was Elf. This movie features Will Ferrel as a human who was adopted by one of Santa's elves and raised as an elf in the North Pole. He then finds out his 'real father' is a typical New York executive living in the big city. He then ventures out to find his father (who is absolutely repulsed that his unknown 'son' thinks he's an elf) and spread Christmas joy to all of New York. Of course he hits a few funny bumps along the way. This movie had my children and I laughing the entire way through. It's very clean humour as well.

The second DVD is A Christmas Story. This movie does have a few cuss words in it. I'd like to remind parents of that prior to them purchasing it. But we talk about those words when their mentioned- because other than that the movie is fantastic. It's a traditional holiday movie most people know or have watched. It's about a young boy who wants a Red Rider BB Gun for Christmas. It's the *only thing he wants- and he will do anything to get it. A fun little story about coming of age and being a young boy.

And the last DVD is National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. This is a good, clean, old fashioned movie about your typical ""have the entire family come stay with you over Christmas"" events. The family goes through everything from decorating the house to arguing with relatives. It's a funny, sweet movie that the whole family can enjoy (even teenagers).

All together these movies are sure to have you giggling and in the Christmas spirit. I'd say they're best for kids ages nine and up. None of the DVDs have additional features. Basically just the movie and a scene selection. But that's all we care about anyways. We don't need special features. The playback quality is perfect. Good sound and amazing picture. They're not HD (I don't think?)- but they are very clear and easy to watch. I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for an affordable collection of Christmas movies.",1388102400,2,2532,4.438709677419355
2934333,5,B000VAHQVU,good value for your money. all 4 movies are great and a lot cheaper then buying them sepertaly in the store,1388102400,,107,4.142857142857143

Example: in the movie elf where buddy is running away from santa's workshop and arctic puffin says, 'hey buddy wanna pick some snow berries?' And buddy yells out, 'not now arctic puffin!'  GONE!  I've also noticed that the sound is slightly off from the video.  Ridiculous.",1386374400,,345,4.796610169491525

All are funny, and Elf, on top of being funny, is also moving and benefits from having the delightful Zooey Deschanel as Will Ferrell's love interest.  You'll even want to watch the closing credits to hear her sing ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" with Leon Redbone.  Christmas Vacation is every bit as funny as the venerated original  ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" and A Christmas Story is simply a modern classic, beloved by one and all.

2934411,5,B000VAHQVU,"These three movies are three of the best Holiday movies ever made.  True classics.  Chevy Chase in Christmas Vacation is hilarious.  A Christmas Story is very nostalgic for anyone who grew up in the upper Midwest USA on the 1950s and 1960s.  Elf is a modern classic that families will enjoy for years.

Great set of holiday DVDs!!",1356652800,,330,4.620689655172414

2934421,5,B000VAHQVU,"I have always loved Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation. Even though not too old of release dates, they are great Christmas Classics. Then I saw Elf, and loved it immediately. It had my family and I laughing the entire movie. I am so glad I bought this set. Movies are one of my favorite Christmas traditions.

Also impressed with the quality of the DVDs. Some 'value packs' are pretty bad quality, but not this one. Even the cases are great; each movie has it's own indivdual case.",1326499200,,485,4.574712643678161
2934422,5,B000VAHQVU,"You've seen or at least heard of all these movies.  If you love Christmas, you'll enjoy these movies, and bundled they're a better deal than buying them all separately.  That's that!  Enjoy.",1325548800,,190,4.875
2934423,5,B000VAHQVU,All 3 DVD's in this collection that I received are in great shape and the movie quality is fantastic.  I love having these movies to watch whenever I want (even not at Christmas time) and seeing how Netflix doesn't let you watch the classic Christmas movies that you love to watch around the holiday's...I had to have them for my collection.

2934425,5,B000VAHQVU,"Watching these three movies with my kids, brings back wonderful Christmas memories. One of their favorite parts in the Elf movie is when Will Ferrel belches real lou. They demand we turn that part as loud as out TV will go. A Christmas Story is one of the best Christmas movies ever. We always watch it during Christmas on tv. Without cable, this is even better.
Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!",1324080000,5,389,4.6521739130434785

2934428,3,B000VAHQVU,"Overall I'd judge this collection to be a bit pricey, considering that these days movie collections don't tend to be that expensive. At least if one is going to charge about $25.00 for a collection of 3 movies these days, shouldn't the movies at least be... well... GOOD?!! Primarily, I bought this for Christmas Story because I hadn't seen it and couldn't find it on Netflix at the time and got curious and got seduced by all the raves, etc. However, the bark was louder than the bite, I guess one could say. Christmas Story didn't turn out to be all that great. Had a loose storyline that was a bit disconnected. More episodic than plot-driven, but still okay for a few laughs. Was a bit disappointed that it was not widescreen either. (Don't know what they were thinking there.)

Christmas Vacation I think everyone has seen already. Not the best in the Lampoon Vacation series, but still not too bad to have readily available on widescreen digital for the Holidays if it's difficult to find on cable. Nice to have with all the DVD features.

Elf I have yet to watch. Couldn't get around to it as I got this package somewhat late in the Holiday Season; so I decided to hold it over for next Christmas. Hope it's good. Most people say it's the best one here though I have my doubts, being that I'm not a Will Farrel fan. But I'll give it a chance just the same, since it's most of the time not right to judge a movie based solely on a dislike for an actor.

The biggest complaint one could have is simply that maybe they could have thrown one more movie into the deal for the price. But, I could be wrong. Perhaps I'll say more next Christmas.",1298505600,,1645,4.386885245901639
