8494952,4,B0068TRVEK,"I think I enjoyed this more than I should have mainly cause it was nice seeing gay/lesbian characters in it.

My major complaint is some scenes were simply too dark and couldn't see anything at all.

Extra star for having the always fun Rebekah Kochan in it.",1444953600,,258,4.468085106382978
8494953,4,B0068TRVEK,after 45 minutes this movie has taste bad acting but taste worth watching so sit down and watch a movie that brings good taste but bad actting,1394841600,,142,4.296296296296297
8494954,3,B0068TRVEK,"Terrible ""b"" movie, but we had to watch it. We had just gone on a ghost hunt to Yorktown and found out there was a movie!",1388880000,2,121,3.6923076923076925
8494955,1,B0068TRVEK,"if you gave this film more than a 2. It screams amateur. The acting is bad, its recorded like a soap opera, there is no tension, the dialogue is silly, and the reveal toward the end is idiotic. The killer (the one that spoke) was just not believable. He should've followed the lead of the other guy and kept his mouth shut. The reason given as to why the killings are happening doesn't carry the weight of the film by any means. Why the second guy turns on the first one is never addressed. Its just poorly done and the generous reviews must be from people connected with the project. I can't imagine any self respecting horrorphile being satisfied with this. Sorry to burst any bubbles.",1342396800,4,687,4.4603174603174605
8494956,1,B0068TRVEK,"poor acting, no script righting, bad cinematography, and creatively void of any entertainment value. life is short for watch such poor film making.",1325030400,2,147,5.434782608695652
8494957,5,B0068TRVEK,"I'm very proud of this film. It's a first time indie film, so it's not ""Hollywood"", but if you're a true film fan, you can see the artistic value and will appreciate this film. A part from the movie, it has great indie bands that participated in the movie's soundtrack and had its own original score, which is pretty great. Search for the soundtrack here on Amazon or check out the movie's website for more info. Thank you for supporting the Independent Arts! :)",1323734400,,462,4.511904761904762
8494958,4,B0068TRVEK,"I was impressed with this movie.  For being the producer's first film, it is very well done.  It was a little frustrating that the scenes are dark, but it is an abandoned building filmed at night, so if there was full lighting, it would be a little strange. Overall, I would recommend watching this movie.",1323561600,4,305,4.527272727272727
8494959,1,B0068TRVEK,"""It's not just ghosts that make you scream...""  That's right.  It's also the moronic dialogue, glacial pace, and impenetrably dark lighting in this movie.  Although it's only 78 minutes long, I felt as though I had been watching for hours and suffering through every second of it. The set up scene where our clueless heroes learn of a haunted asylum and decide to visit it, which in a sane world would take 5 minutes, spans 20 soul sucking minutes of uninspired chit-chat.

The movie moves on to scene after scene of people wandering around an abandoned asylum (a location that I'm sure would work wonderfully for a film made by anyone else but these clowns) accompanied by more inane chatting, the worst tribute to the Psycho shower scene that I have ever seen, and an unpleasant, unnecessary, wooden sex scene in a chapel.  The actors can go forward in this life knowing that there will be no vengeance wreaked for their blasphemy because no just god would allow this atrocity of a film to exist.  The climax scene attempts a twist in such a way that will only leave a viewer scratching their head and trying to avert their eyes from the fellow in his boxers tied up with duct tape and a little too happy about it.  That there is a sequel in the works shakes me to my very core.

You will not like this film unless you have a taste for the worst horror movies imaginable.  This does not even have camp value.  You have been warned.",1323216000,8,1433,4.476923076923077
8494960,2,B0068TRVEK,The movie would have been better if you could see what was going on. the whole movie is so dark. I have been to yorktown and was wanting to see places I got to walk around in.,1322784000,8,175,3.7567567567567566
8494961,5,B0068TRVEK,As many independent films as i have watched this is outstanding.  Its impressive the amount of work that went into this movie compared to other indie films.  Happy to support these guys and i am looking forward to seeing more films come from them.,1322611200,4,247,4.590909090909091
