4070018,4,B003552QUO,"Down through the years, the last 5 or so anyway, I have recorded several VHS tapes of this movie, cannot figure out 'why' no DVD has yet been issued.  Same goes for another Clint Walker western FORT DOBBS (1958), almost makes you wonder what Warner Bros. have against ole Clint.  Maybe walking off the set of Cheyenne fifty some years back still rankles Warner Bros. Gordon Douglas directed  all three movies, FORT DOBBS, YELLOWSTONE KELLY (1959), and GOLD OF THE SEVEN SAINTS and as noted not one of these fine westerns has ever been released on DVD.

This movie comes from the 1957 western novel DESERT GUNS written by Steve Frazee, with the movie (1961) and book being fairly different.  I think so much of the movie that I tracked down the book (which can be kinda hard to find) wishing to see how much variance there is between the two.  Well for instance, Rainbolt is 26 years old in the book yet Shawn is in his 50s.  Anyone seeing the movie will know right off that neither Clint nor Roger are portrayed like that.  Also at book's ending Rainbolt rides off with a female.  Just a couple of differences, there are several more. One other for instance:  Roger Moore is tied with wet rawhide in the movie, but in the book it is Rainbolt completely wrapped in wet hide so all the victim can view is the sky.

Another aspect to this western film is the performance that rings down the years from veteran actor Chill Wills, his portrayal of Doctor Wilson Gates is one that will remain with most viewers.  You really come to appreciate him as the film rolls on.

However, to me the movie is superior to the book.  Probably because I saw it first and read the book later.  Last words would be:  watch the movie because it is an interesting story filled with adventure very well portrayed by Clint and Roger.  The black and white photography  (Joseph F. Biroc) adds a stark reality that color might not have captured as well.  The location (Arches National Park, Utah) of the movie also adds to the panorama of the scenes and the story itself.  I have several favorite western movies and this is one of them, if you watch the movie it may become one of yours as well.

4070019,5,B003552QUO,"I saw this on Encore Westerns, had never seen it before, Clint and Roger are fur trappers, but they somehow strike gold.. ofcourse the word gets out when Roger has to go in to a town to get a pack  horse to help carry the gold.  From that moment on there is a trail of scoundrels with gold fever trying to steal their gold...It's a fun movie, adventure, a little romance,  and ofcourse  Clint Walker is his gorgeous self..Roger Moore is very cute and entertaining.....",1246060800,17,468,4.470588235294118

4070022,4,B003552QUO,"Gotta love Clint Walker and Roger Moore together!  I have just about everything Clint was ever in, including all the Cheyenne shows.  The only down side to this one is that Clint is probably his ""raciest"" in it (as racy as Clint gets).  Some crass girly stuff and Clint actually swills some liquor to excess, instead of ordering a ham sandwich and a coffee or sipping a ""short beer"" while everyone else makes fools of themselves.  Still, a fun movie, although it's the only Clint that doesn't get 5 stars from me.....  I like the clean-cut Cheyenne kind of Clint!",1442188800,,563,4.59

4070031,5,B003552QUO,Like all Clint Walker movies I really enjoyed it & plan on watching it again soon. It was an interesting plot & actors were good in their roles and finally it was not like all the many Cheyenne parts. He plays a different character & I admire him for the changes although it is hard for me to ever forget CHEYENNE because they just do not portray his particular anyone like him. Too bad more had been raised by the cheyenne....of course we all know it was just a part he played but some of the characteristics had to be within Mr. Walker. Buy it and you will enjoy it if you are a western lover as I am.,1404518400,2,603,4.07563025210084
4070032,3,B003552QUO,I did enjoy this but think it was over rated. Good to see Roger Moore in his early days. I understand why he did not make many westerns.,1400371200,,136,3.892857142857143
4070033,5,B003552QUO,this was made in 1961 color would make it better but I still is a great movie and story line and kinda funny but its worth a watch clint made some real good movies too with a fe w hotties .,1389484800,,189,3.6341463414634148

4070035,4,B003552QUO,I am a fan of Clint Walker in almost anything.  This movie is very typical of his work in the Cheyenne TV series.  A good Western type movie,1356739200,,140,3.9642857142857144
4070036,3,B003552QUO,"Aside from a VERY young and extremely cute Roger Moore (sporting a silly Irish accent) and, of course, Clint himself, this is just a so-so western.  I expected better but will probably give it another shot before deciding whether or not to keep it.  The story is basically about a couple of buddies who have some gold they're trying to cash in and the bad guys are after it so they hide it.  Pretty predictable and, unless I missed it, ""the seven saints"" wasn't really explained.  There's one whole segment at the house of Clint's old ""friend"" (which I fast-forwarded through--maybe that's when the ""saints"" was revealed) that could have been completely left out as it really didn't add anything to the storyline and actually bogged the movie down somewhat.  It isn't that this movie is a stinker, it just doesn't hold up against other Clint Walker movies like Fort Dobbs or Yellowstone Kelly--in my humble opinion.",1348444800,,915,4.802547770700637
4070037,1,B003552QUO,"I read somewhere that there might be issues with these 'manufactured by order DVD-Rs' and that is correct.  We cannot get this one or 'Yellowstone Kelly' to play.

Would have rated it zero stars, but that option is unavailable.  We love Clint Walker and are very disappointed.

With that said we recently ordered an item from Amazon that was $144.  They 'confused' our account info and the order did not go thru.  When we went to resubmit the order the price was way over $200.  Especially interesting to me since this was the first order mix-up we've ever had with Amazon.  When I asked them about this via email I received no reply.",1298764800,6,634,4.548672566371682
4070038,5,B003552QUO,"This is a must have for all western classic lovers. Congratulations to Warner Archives for doing a great job & bringing back all the great movies from the 50's & 60's. In fact, I've enjoyed Clint Walker from the famous 'Cheyenne' tv series. It's great to see him in action again but this time, he's playing a different role thus he has a partner, none other than Roger Moore from the great James Bond movies in the eighties. It's an absolute fun to watch two great actors together in a western adventure filled with danger, excitement & a little bit of humor to stir things up. Apparently, it is in black & white but it's still a great watch, it would be fantastic to watch them in color. I strongly recommend this DVD to all.",1293494400,14,726,4.385185185185185

I was probably under one of those desert rocks seen in the movie,all these years,Good Movie.
Good Cast,found Roger Moore Annoying His Accent and Singing.
When you look at these actors you think to yourself,hey,i know him,Vitto Scotti and Robert Middleton.
Excellent Video Clarity and Sound,again got it through WB.
If you like this movie then you will also like Fort Dobbs,a classic.
Look at the Dust Fly In Those Mountains.",1282953600,7,484,4.843373493975903

8388719,4,B003552QUO,"There are many ways to ""read"" this film: for some it is a poor man's ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", for others a simple western, to a few an antecedent of ""Brokeback Mountain"" (and when considering it as such, these two cowboys surely had more sense of humor than the latter couple), the third installment of a Douglas-Walker western trilogy they all are valid, and it also fits in one kind of film that somehow stresses me: ""the desert trap film"". There are comedies of this type (as ""The Gods Must Be Crazy), but I refer to those dramas in which characters are literally trapped in a desert or a snow-covered steppe, where they suffer the inclemency of the weather of these extreme locations during all the running time. In the sub-category ""desert"", you find, for example, ""The King Is Alive"", ""The Flight of the Phoenix"", the Mexican ""Viento negro"" and even indoors plots as ""The Wind""; and in ""snow"", there are ""Quintet"", ""The Thing"" or ""Never Cry Wolf"". In ""Gold of the Seven Saints"", Clint Walker and Roger Moore never leave the dry lands in their intent to take a fortune in gold to the town Seven Saints, some kind of nowhere land in the 19th century. During the trip they have some well-written and finely-delivered manly conversations, but for 35 minutes everything is slow and low key until Chil Wills as a ""medicine man"" enters and delivers action, and later Robert Middleton and Leticia Romn in costume add some Mexican chili to the events. There is nothing special about this film, but somehow it works. Walker projects a pleasant personality, while Moore is surprisingly funny as his Irish companion. Gordon Douglas is a director with no following, but I like a few of his works, as the hilarious ""Zombies on Broadway"", the science-fiction movie ""Them!"", the off- beat western ""Rio Conchos"", and now I add this one.",1487462400,,1836,4.740625
