8388432,5,B0034KVTM6,"Very informative DVD - Keith Moon may have been the best drummer that ever lived, he had a talent didn't match his brains. Left school without getting a proper education & while many thought of him as life of the party, he was really an irresponsible jerk that lived in child's dream in never growing up & taking responsibility for his actions.

The very fact he may have relised the party boy image he had created was becoming hard to live up to didn't save him if he needs to waste his time on drug fix nor follow the proper medication his doctor had prescribed no wonder he died young.

Talented drummer who wasted his life clowning around & paid the price- not the good die young, but the stupid die young & not the role model the young generation should ever follow.",1393113600,,771,4.384615384615385

Nobody ever played the drums like  Keith Moon .He was entertaining enough watch during the whole show. Of course this was impossible with the combined talent of Pete Townsend, John Entwhistle and Roger Daltry on stage at the same time. He was almost indescribable.  He was  a once in a life time person in history that lived  too fast and died too young. Sad  but honest account of the  final days  of  a legend.",1369353600,2,527,4.275510204081633
8388436,3,B0034KVTM6,"Good morning, campers!

It's your old pal Keith Moon here. You know, ""Moonie,"" ""Moon the Loon"" ...or, as I very much prefer, The Greatest Rock and Roll Drummer that Ever Was, that is. Or was. I think... But I digress.

Anyroad, we meet today so that I may bring your undivided attention to this marvelous DVD disc entitled - just a moment here, as I do want to make sure I get this completely correct - ahh, yes. ""Keith Moon, Final 24: His Final Hours.""

Well then! I guess you could call this the, well, final word on the subject, ah-HA-Ha-HaHaHa!

Final 24: His Final Hours. Yes, a tad redundant, I do agree, but nevertheless this splendid disc does promise to, in the very words of its very own press sheet you see, ""unlock the hidden secrets, psychological flaws and events that result in the tragic deaths of global icons."" Here here!

""Maps out the final twenty-four hours of a famous person's life,"" it goes on. ""Weaves the star's back-story with events from their last day, which lays bare the threads of fate that led inextricably from childhood to the moment of death."" I see! ""These are no ordinary biographies."" I should hope not... ""They're psychological detective stories attempting to uncover the mystery of why the celebrity died.""

You know, I've been wondering that myself quite a bit, I must say! ah-HA-Ha-HaHaHa!

MY ""final 24"" then: Bailing out on Paul McCartney's ""Buddy Holly Story"" premiere party - a dreadful bore, it truly was ...and I don't just mean the movie - then home for a quick cutlet and ""Dr. Phibes"" - now THERE'S a movie, mate! - lay it all down beside the missus for a quick kip and then... and then...

To be perfectly honest, things do get a bit, shall we say hazy from this point onwards, as I'm sure you can understand, ah-HA-Ha-HaHaHa! But this disc here really does seem to do a fabulous job at pulling all of the pieces quite properly together, as it were.

For a starter, there's a lovely little segment spent on my long, long-ago childhood. Even shows one of my old Alperton Secondary School reports: ""Retarded artistically""? ""Idiotic in other aspects""?? Not by `alf, then, ah-HA-Ha-HaHaHa! I mean, it's simply called ADHD today, innit? But back then, it was just a whack-it upside the be-hind, and ""catch us if you can""!

But I reckon, when all was said and sung, I didn't turn out all that pitifully, now did I?

Nice that they show some marvelous old Gene Krupa footage as well - now THERE'S a drummer! - and before you know it I hook up with Pete and Roger and John and, well ...you know, they never did really ask me to join. Nobody ever actually said ""You're in."" They just said ""What're you doin' on Monday?""

But I took that as a ""yes"" nevertheless. ah-HA-Ha-HaHaHa!

My, my. And look at all the wonderful people they have interviewed about my Final 24. My almost-biographer Anne Nightingale - how are you, my darling? - and my own Best from the West, Pamela ""I'm With The Drummer Tonight"" Des Barres, looking as utterly scrumptious as ever. As well as some less, shall we say delectable writers such as Roy Carr and Tony Fletcher. Dear, dear Tony. He really did write a wonderful book on me. And I do appreciate it. Just make sure they don't let Roger hire Mike Myers to play me in the movie version, Tone - ah-HA-Ha-HaHaHa!

And there's Richard Barnes and dear Dougal Butler, speaking of Who books, and Jon Wolff, speaking of Who roadies - ah-HA-Ha-HaHaHa - and Kenney Jones, oh my and, oh! What have we here?

Alice Cooper, talking all about our lost Los Angeles weekend - or in my case, incredibly misplaced twenty-seven months, ah-HA-Ha-HaHaHa - alongside John Lennon and Harry Nilsson and Micky Dolenz and Ringo and even dear old Steve Cropper, shown here trying his damndest to produce one of my, um, recording sessions, quote unquote. ah-HA-Ha-HaHaHa! Sorry about the carpet, dear boy. And the glass. And oh yes, the 16-track...

But who is this now? Legs Larry? Legs Larry Smith? Yes yes, telling all about the night we... we...

Well, there was an accident, you see. These bloody skinheads had surrounded my Bentley when we came out of the pub, getting all stroppy and shaking us and the car every which way. My dear, dear driver Neil Boland got out to chase them away, or at least try to reason with the bastards, as they were frightening my wife Kim.

But just as I took to the wheel to try to save him, they threw Neil under the bloody tires! And I couldn't see, and I ran... I ran him over. Killed him, I did.

It wasn't my fault.

NOT my bloody FAULT, alright?

And Amanda? Mandy? Is that you I see now?? Haven't you grown up all proper and lady-like, just like your mum! I love you, Mandy. I miss you, my little girl.

And Annette? My love? There you are, my sweet! God, it is good to see you again. You look almost... almost real.

Oh, Christ. I must turn this off now. I'm sorry, everybody. I truly am. It's just that I... I mean, if only I could...

""He made it longer than Hendrix or Joplin or Brian Jones or Jim Morrison,"" Miss Pamela says. Damn right I did!

""So that was pretty surprising that he actually lived as long as he did.""

I see, Pamela.

Listen, everybody. Watch ""Keith Moon, Final 24: His Final Hours."" Really, you should.

But when you do, all I ask is that you remember what Alice Cooper says:

""If you take away all the insanity and just listen to the drums, he is irreplaceable.""

You see? Irreplaceable.

Or, if you will, The Greatest Rock and Roll Drummer that Ever Was.

Right. See you all soon then?",1350950400,3,5497,4.498993963782696
8388437,5,B0034KVTM6,This really covers the whole story of his life with depth and has some very cool footage of him throughout. This series is so much better than others the same ground. Tasteful excellent DVD.,1344902400,,190,4.617647058823529
8388438,5,B0034KVTM6,"Keith Moon really enjoyed his fame. He was wild and partied a lot, destroying hotel rooms and drums in the process. But he was also one of the best drummers in the business, one that also paid the high price of an early death due to his excesses. And we, as humans, don't get tired of all the gossip that surrounds famous people deaths, particularly by drugs or the like. ""Keith Moon - Final 24: His Final Hours"" is another fascinating and captivating episode of the series ""Final 24,"" which examines the last 24 hours of the late rock artist.

As with other episodes in the series, this one alternates between dramatization, using actors as the main characters, and archival footage about the artist's history. We learn that he was born Keith John Moon, on August 23, 1946. He dropped out of school and, inspired by Gene Krupa, he got hooked on drums. He joined The Who, the group by which he became famous, on April, 1964, when he was seventeen-years old. Events that molded and affected his life, such as his failed marriage, fatherhood, an accident in which a dear friend was killed, life in Los Angeles, and more are also detailed. And, of course, there are the drugs and booze.

Keith Moon's last 24 hours began in London, on September 6, 1978. He and his girlfriend were staying in an apartment where, coincidentally, Mama Cass Elliot died four years earlier. He was trying very hard to quit alcoholism, using the drug Heminevrin. Apparently, he didn't feel like going out that night, as to avoid any temptations. However, he was invited to a party by Paul McCartney, and he was struggling about attending it. Against his best judgment, he and his girlfriend decided to go, not without snorting cocaine before leaving. He was well-loved by people and was always the life of the party. Once the event was over, Keith returned to the apartment, got something to eat, went to sleep, and never woke up. He was pronounced dead on September 7, 1978, at 5:50 PM. The autopsy revealed that he had 26 undisolved Heminevrin tablets in his stomach. He did not consume the drug according to prescription, as instructed by the doctor.

In addition to the archival footage, the documentary features interviews with people close to Moon, like Anette Walter-Lax (his girlfriend, and last person to see Moon alive), Amanda De Wolf (Moons' daughter), authors Tony Fletcher and Richard Barnes, Alice Copper, Pamela Des Barres (perhaps the most famous groupie of them all), and more.

""Keith Moon - Final 24: His Final Hours"" is a well-documented film, with a lot of information. It takes a fair look at the artist and his unfortunate death. Perhaps Alice Cooper said it best: ""Keith was an octopus, the best rock drummer of all time."" Additional titles in this collection include episodes on Nicole Brown Simpson, Janis Joplin, Gianni Versace, John Belushi, Sid Vicious, Marvin Gaye, David Koresh, Jim Morrison, River Phoenix and more.

8388439,5,B0034KVTM6,"On September 6th, 1978 Keith Moon attended a screening for the movie The Buddy Holly Story held by Paul McCartney and his wife Linda. The Who had just released the album Who Are You less than a month earlier to critical acclaim and the screening promised to be one of the biggest social events in London that year. He had initially turned down the invitation, but as the night wore on finally gave in. He was given a seat of honor at the hosts' dinner table. He also announced plans to propose to his girlfriend that night--Keith Moon had every intention of getting his life together, of settling down.

Moon had come to London's West End to escape from the world of rock and roll and all of the temptations it offered as he tried to kick an alcohol addiction that had been raging out of control for more than a decade. He was staying at a flat owned by friend Harry Nilsson with the woman he planned to propose to, Swedish model Annette Walter-Lax. He had been prescribed the medication Heminevrin, a strong sedative, to counter his withdrawal symptoms during detox.

Moon had been reluctant to attend the McCartney's preview party; he knew what temptations might possibly be waiting for him and he didn't trust himself to be strong enough to turn them down. He had been through failed rehab attempts before and had decided that the only way to guarantee success was to completely avoid all situations where alcohol would be served.

Keith Moon had many reasons to turn his life around: he was in love with Annette and had decided to ask her to marry him, his band's latest album was a huge commercial and critical success, more importantly, his health and his drumming were beginning to suffer from the years of drug and alcohol abuse. He also had one other motivation to dry out. He had passed out several times over the years in the middle of concerts, on one such occasion Pete Townshend had pulled an audience member up on stage and the 19 year old boy had filled in for him--to the audience's delight. The band had let him know, in no uncertain terms, that he could be replaced, and would be, if he didn't get his drinking under control. Moon was determined to get his life together once and for all. He was determined to kick booze out of his life for good.

But it wasn't just alcohol that was a problem for Keith Moon. From the time he had joined The Who at age 17, he had cultivated a reputation for craziness, from throwing furniture and TV sets out of hotel windows to stripping naked or wearing elaborate costumes. Keith Moon was the life of the party at every party he attended. People followed him around just waiting to see what he would do next. On the night before his death Moon was concerned that he would be disappointing his fans and friends if he showed up straight and boring.

He had decided to stay away that night, content to remain in the flat with Annette, not taking any risks. So what happened in those final 24 hours that made him change his mind and attend the party? What event finally broke his resolve? When Annette tried to wake him in the late morning on September 7th, 1978 he was completely unresponsive, not breathing. At the time of his death he had cocaine and alcohol in his system, in his stomach were 26 as yet undigested Heminevrin tablets. His death was ruled an overdose from the six or more tablets that he had digested.

Keith Moon: His Final Hours features interviews with close friends like Alice Cooper, Kenney Jones and Annette Walter-Lax. His tour manager John Wolff, daughter Amanda De Wolf and biographers Tony Fletcher and Richard Barnes as well as archival concert and television footage tell the story of Keith Moon's life. It also includes excellent re-enactments that detail the last 24 hours before his death.

There are some striking similarities between Keith Moon's death and that of Janis Joplin. Both were well known for their wild ways and their addictions, but they had both begun cleaning up their acts at the time of their deaths. And then they were gone... leaving only their musical legacies, and questions, behind.

I'd highly recommend Keith Moon: His Final Hours for those who love 60's and 70's classic rock, and for fans of The Who and Keith Moon.

The series The Final 24 released by MVD Entertainment Group is part documentary and part biography, it examines the lives of the famous dead, looking for the clues, the harbingers, of what was to come. By examining the past, and re-creating the events that occurred on the day they died, Producer Nick Godwin is able to capture, through reflection, the tragic end that was always rushing towards them like a head-on train.

Also a great Final 24.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Janis-Joplin-Final-24-Her-Final-Hours/dp/B0034KVTLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Janis Joplin - Final 24: Her Final Hours</a>",1277251200,11,4875,4.785969084423305
