8286383,5,B001CB59EI,"A great show done by the best Rock and Roll Show on the road today. Excellent vocals excellent musicians and an excellent show.
  Also buy Texican Style one of the best concerts I've ever seen and I've seen Over 4,000. These guys are outstanding and this show is before the Grammy. So is Texican Style. They still play hard and have developed a much better show. Don't miss them if they come around.",1357257600,,399,4.4520547945205475
8286384,5,B001CB59EI,"My first real introduction to Los Lonely Boys was their appearance on CMT's ""Crossroads"" with the great Ronnie Milsap in 2005. That show was enough to tell me that these guys were certainly a step above most of today's Top 40 stars in the talent department. After watching this dynamic concert filmed at San Francisco's legendary Fillmore Auditorium in October 2004, it becomes all too clear that Henry, JoJo, and Ringo Garza are nothing less than a blessing as we suffer through the bleakest decade in American music. Sadly, Los Lonely Boys have had ONE hit single since hitting the national scene five years ago, and there's a simple reason for this. If these guys were allowed on your local top 40 station, they would put today's manufactured ""American Idols"" right out of business!

In a mainstream music scene where cookie-cutter stars can't seem to deliver anything besides sex appeal, egos, theatrics, gimmicks, and songs that all sound the same, the Garza brothers deliver the things that really matter: strong singing, good songwriting, powerful musicianship, and a dynamic stage presence that will keep an audience on their feet all night. Los Lonely Boys stand out from the crowd by being the exact opposite of everything wrong with today's top 40 hitmakers. They are the REAL DEAL, and the proof is in this fine concert DVD.

Any band that claims both Stevie Ray Vaughan and Ronnie Milsap as major influences can be nothing less than the real deal as far as I'm concerned, and with Stevie Ray's former keyboardist Reese Wynans joining the band as a special guest, you know this has to be a show worth seeing. From start to finish, the Garza brothers rock their way through a vibrant set of high-energy, Tex-mex rock n' roll played with power and passion. ""More than Love"" is a really nice ballad that spotlights the tight vocal harmony of the band, and the jaw-dropping instrumental showcase ""Onda"" is a true highlight along with their top ten hit ""Heaven"", and a fine version of the classic ""La Bamba"".

As a bonus feature, the brothers are shown goofing around backstage and mingling with fans. Also included is a red hot version of ""Superstition"" that would make Stevie Wonder and Stevie Ray both proud. Any lover of blues-based rock n' roll who has lost all faith in today's mainstream music will be delighted to witness the talent and enthusiasm that these guys bring to the stage. This concert is everything that mainstream music SHOULD be in the 21st century!

If you care anything about the future of American music, please do a big favor for any clueless Top 40/American Idol lovers you know who need an education in REAL DEAL MUSICAL TALENT. Buy them a copy of this DVD immediately along with four others that should grace their collections...
