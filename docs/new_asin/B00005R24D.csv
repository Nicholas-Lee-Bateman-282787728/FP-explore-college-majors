Even the sad music cannot settle down the tone of the entitly of the strangeness of the movie at all.

From the beginning when Gerard thinks that his wife is not happy for him and he thinks that she needs another man to please her and make her happy again made me felt this movie will be weird.

Then when they were in this cafe, they meet this man with a beard and ask him to be with the wife.
 Then there's three of them.
 They take turns and sleep together.

I admit that Carole Laure, the wife is super pretty and all, the story is still strange. And it is getting even more stranger when three of them are taking care of the summer camp for 13 years old boys.

One of the boys are a very clever boy who is way mature then his age happens to fall in love with the wife Carole and even asks her to be his lover.
 At the beginning, she treats him as a kid but as time goes by it became sexual and at the end she even got pregnant.
 She couldn't got pregnant from both men before.

The story ends with her being happy again having a baby.
 Two men on the street wonering.

Did she achieved her true love? I guess. The boy was playing billards in front of her. He is her husband now.

Strange love story.
 Oh, you don't need a hanckerchief though.

7951850,5,B00005R24D,"This is one of Depardieu's best films (and one of the director's also).  It is amoral, anarchic, and thoroughly engaging.  From the very first scene, you realize you are in a world that is as unlikely as it is realistically rendered, but you are in for the ride.  The film predates both Depardieu's later obesity and the wave of political correctness that has stultified film comedy.  Highly recommended.",1410480000,,404,4.897058823529412
7951851,5,B00005R24D,"Complex, very funny, sad, very French look at love and sexual dynamics, with terrific acting all around.

Gerard Depardieu plays a man who truly loves his wife, but can't understand her or her depression.
So he decides to get her a lover to cheer her up. But it doesn't work, and now two men are bewitched and
befuddled by the sad, repressed Solange.

Ultimately only a love affair with a 13 year old boy - who in many ways is the most mature character in
the film - gives her joy.

Transgressive, uncomfortable, surreal and tweaking both sides of the war of the sexes equally; men are fools
who can only look at women through a narrow prism, and women are complex and weird to the point of
absurdity, this is a film that makes me laugh and cringe (in a good way) in equal measure.",1349568000,2,781,4.335616438356165
7951852,3,B00005R24D,"I took note of ""Get Out Your Hankerchiefs"" because it won the Oscar for Best Foreign-Language Film"" in 1978.  I did enjoy it but I had a reaction similar to the one I got from ""Murmers of the Heart"".  ""Murmers"" pushed the envelope even farther than ""Get Out Your Hankerchiefs"" did but this comedy does eventually evolve into something that many will not see the humor in.  The director coaxes us into what many, myself included, were reluctantly ready to go along with.  However, when he carries it further, I was left disappointed.  Too bad, becaue I liked the inanity of the situation that was initially presented.  There is a lot of unique humor that is able to happen in this movie and there is a lot of talent involved in making it all happen.  I have come to accept that many European movies have relaxed standards compared to those in American Cinema.  Usually that means that I have to wait for the kids to go to bed to watch what would otherwise be a standard PG-13 film.  However, there are still taboos in our society.  A film like ""Murmers of the Heart"" might dare to examine them but for a film like ""Get out your Hankerchiefs"" to ignore and/or make light of them just didn't sit well with me.  I like to fancy myself an ""enlightened prude"" but the latter portion of ""Get Out Your Hankerchiefs"" reminded me that I must be a prude first and enlightened second.  I guess I cling to the idea that there are so many better ways to create a great movie without stooping to this level.  In all fairness, I should give this movie a ""4 Star"" rating but I took one away for propriety's sake.",1223683200,2,1595,4.402730375426621
7951853,4,B00005R24D,"To say that this movie is not for everybody would be putting it mildly.  There are plenty of people who would label as perverse a movie which culminates in a 12-year-old prodigy seducing & impregnating a grown woman, and this would not be an unfair assessment.

And yet, one could say that the most perverse thing about this movie is that the humor works.  Situations which should have left me appalled instead left me smiling & laughing, because when all is said & done, this is one well-crafted movie.  One can argue whether the absurdity trumps the perversity, but noone can argue that this is an exceedingly well-made, well-acted production.",1182988800,,645,4.836363636363636
7951854,5,B00005R24D,"It was awonderful experience to watch this movie, first by myself and secondly with a few friends. We all ended discussing the contents, the scenes, the plot and everything that made that movie so interesting. I didn't expect less from Gerard Depardieu acting..Very entertaining and super..We all enjoyed it and cannot wait to watch another one in the same category..Still we want Gerad depardieu and his serious crew...Very good, very pleasant movie...",1143072000,3,453,5.305555555555555
7951855,4,B00005R24D,"Gerard Depardieu is married to an unresponsive woman; thinking a lover might help cheer her up, he gets her one. When this doesn't work both men come to the conclusion that having a baby would do the trick. But this too fails. At end only a 14-year-old boy brings her out of the doldrums--and gets her pregnant. Highly improbable, but very funny. Won an Academy Award.",1110412800,4,368,4.590909090909091
7951856,4,B00005R24D,Try as I might I will never understand french humor.  Yes this movie was funny and yes the acting is excellent don't get me wrong but come on the whole 12 year old kid suducing a grown women thing??? I don't understand maybe I just don't think very deeply.,1021248000,8,256,4.224489795918367
7951857,5,B00005R24D,"In 1978 when Bertrand Blier's ""Get Out Your Handkerchiefs"" was released in the United States we were all bopping to the beat of ""Saturday Night Fever"" and the Bee Gees. It was also a time when the ""foreign film"" was what Independent films are today: the place to go for the daring, the obscene maybe, the intellectual...sometimes.(Haven't you wondered why so few foreign movies are released in the USA today?)
""GOYH"" was something else again, though:  at the beginning an anarchic though sunny comedy of manners and by the end a black comedy with big concerns on it's mind dealing in 1978 (mind you) with subjects that are still taboo in the USA in 2002!
The first scene of the film throws us into a situation that is  already in progress: Raoul (Gerard Depardieu) is frantic because his wife Solange (Carole Laure),lanquidly eating her saurkraut: obviously unhappy or manic depressive or both.
Raoul is so desperate to make Solange happy that, when he spys Stephane (Patrick Dawaere) in the restaurant, he offers to bring him over to the table for Solange's amusement and pleasure.  And so he does.
First there is just Raoul and Solange; then Stephane and Solange; then Raoul, a woman he pulls off the street to comment on what he's just done, Stephane and Solange...all sitting at the table in the restaurant. The exposition is accomplished so quickly and so absurdly that we feel we are watching a silent film comedy. Blier writes and directs this first extended scene with such expert awareness of timing and pacing that it takes your breath away and grabs your interest immediately.
Ultimately, though Stephane and Raoul do their best to make Solange happy, it's Christian (Riton Liebman) who is finally the only one who touches her heart. (Don't ask)
In order to make this hybrid comedy-drama-romance work the actors must be quick on their feet and possess charm and panache to spare. All those involved do and then some:  Depardieu and Dawaere, both looking young, handsome and flummoxed, Michel Serrault (soon to make a big splash in ""La Cage aux Folles""),as a neighbor who inadvertenly gets pulled into this caper and Carole Laure with probably the hardest role to pull off: part zombie, part plain-jane, part sex pot.
""Get Out Your Handkerchiefs"" is pain stakingly and downright seditious in it's refusal to adhere to any social or societal rules...and because of this, it must to be cherished and revered for these attributes even now; some 24 years after it's initial release.",1014163200,16,2488,4.902612826603326
