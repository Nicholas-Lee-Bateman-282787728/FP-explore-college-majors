3858091,5,B00274SIVA,"Ah, nostalgia.  ""Hotel"" is a well-written and well-acted series of the type we don't really see anymore.  With James Brolin to draw in the female viewers and Connie Seleca for the male viewers, this always brought a nice close to my Wednesday evenings. It was a good change of pace after the vicious, shoulder-padded melodrama of ""Dynasty."" It was fun to find out who would guest star on the show from week to week. I think having weekly revolving guest stars was part of what kept the shows fresh and entertaining, and helped the series continue for a total of 5 seasons. I'm really looking forward to the realease of the rest of the seasons!",1251676800,4,643,4.582608695652174

3858093,5,B00274SIVA,"I am a first time viewer of this show, as a kid, before TV had ratings and warnings and kid channels and one TV in the house where everyone watched together,no matter what the shows was about, we were more of a Knots Landing and Dallas and a bit of Dynasty family (when it comes to prime time drama)but now that I'm older and wishing for the good old days of TV I'm trying out all the shows I never got to see and many shows born long before me.  Most are better than so many of today, some are campy and fun and dated in a great way, others were bad ideas or poorly executed.

This is one of the good ones.  Light drama, more story/depth/drama than Love Boat w/o the comedy but easy to get hooked on.  The guest stars are absolutely wonderful!  They are all from that time, all from other favorite shows of mine and everyone elses.  How we missed this I don't know - it would have been right up our alley - even though I hadn't watched it before, it makes me have that warm feeling of home and comfort before you grow up and have all the responsibilities my parents had when I was feeling so safe and comfortable and stressing out about things that in hindsight were so little but seemed so big as a kid.

The stories and stars change every episode but the main cast are the same and draw you in because they have character depth and relationships beyond the weekly stories. And the actors and actresses from those days all look different, different body types, hair, makeup, etc like real people do - unlike today where most people on tv don't resemble anyone you would interact with in your daily life unless you are a movie star, model, or hang out on South Beach etc.  They are glamorous for sure, but every show has a good variety of different people, and even different ages from kids with thier parents to great actors in thier 60's and 70's all in compelling stories.

The weekly stories are surprisingly similar to today, and still relevant, but without all the nudity, vulgarity, profanity, sex, etc that seem to be required of today's TV shows.  I'm not offended by any of that but today it isn't used when it is truly relevant to the story, which would enhance the story -the stories are written with the sole purpose of shocking the audience with it's ""hipness"" or ""edginess"" squeezing in as much vulgarity as they can whenever they can to the detriment of the story and the shows in some cases.

Shows like this one from the 70's and 80's have so much more depth in many cases because they were required to find a way to keep the audience entertained and surprised and interested in next week without being allowed to take the easy way to get a WOW, it was all there but much was implied and off camera so they actually had to use the plot, the show, the acting skills, creativity, fashion, popular guest stars etc. to keep you watching.  This is a show that did it very well and I'm really enjoying it.  But it's one of the many I have to ""ration"" watch because I'm afraid they won't release the rest and ""poof"" it will be gone and no more new episodes of ""HOTEL"" to enjoy.

As you can tell, I really like it - but don't get me wrong, I love many many of today's shows but many of the good ones that have story and depth and interest get lost among the shock factor of and cheapness of some reality shows and edgy insult comedy and shock drama and end up getting cancelled before you get to see the 4th episode - right about the time you are totally hooked and love the show.  It makes these good older shows much more appealing to fill in the time period when one of the good ones got cancelled or moved.

Overall, just a great show...I hope there's more where this came from!",1250553600,4,3693,4.292086330935252
3858094,5,B00274SIVA,"As a long time viewer of the show, I really enjoyed watching the pilot and first season shows. It is overwhelming to find that many of the guest)characters on the show and the securty man-Nathan Cook are now deceased. Most of the storylines kept me interested. However; as mentioned by a previous viewer, Bette Davis, another ""great"" actress was not mentioned in the credits--I wonder why??. Her character played a significant role to the plot of the show as the other characters...Anne Baxter carried the show for many seasons until her death during the series in 86. The last show (near the end) that mentioned Mrs. Cabot's death by Peter and Christine--which was well acted by them both and drew them closer together--I found this to be one of the most sentimental moments and was one of my favorite endings (cliff hanger) of that particular season. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend this 1st season disc to others in the hope that the other series dvds will be available soon.",1250294400,2,984,4.828402366863905
3858095,4,B00274SIVA,"""Hotel: The First Season""
(Paramount, 2009)
---------------------------------------
Premiering in 1983, Aaron Spelling's TV series, ""Hotel"", was set in a fictitious San Francisco luxury hotel (modeled on the swank, true-life Fairmont, which is a pretty classy joint) and had a ""Love Boat""/""Fantasy Island""-like premise, in which each week guests come to stay at the hotel, bringing with them their dreams, their problems and their disastrous Reagan-era fashion faux-pas.

The show followed the popular hit ""Dynasty,"" and emulated that show's celebration of wealth and glamour, as well as its dips into vulgarity, raunchiness and pure TV formula. Although it first aired in '83, the show has a distinctly '70s feel, including a plethora of anorexic blondes and jaunty, swinging males.  Suave, hirsute and self-assured, James Brolin stars as the hotel manager, a nice guy who each week saves worst-case hotel guests from their problems. His supporting cast (in the hotel staff at least) are largely undistinguished, although Bette Davis was in the pilot as the hotel owner (replaced next episode by Anne Baxter); Connie Sellecca is the office manager who becomes Brolin's romantic interest, after a ""Moonlighting""-like period of flirtation. The show comes complete with a revolving cast of guest stars who come to stay for an episode or two -- these include big-name stars (mostly of yesteryear), lesser lights, lots of ""Hollywood Squares""-worthy 'Seventies survivors and the like.  The list includes Scott Baio, Adrienne Barbeau, Scatman Crothers, Morgan Fairchild, Jose Ferrer, Eva Gabor, Arte Johnson, Shirley Jones, Louis Jourdan, Martin Landau, Liberace, Lynn Redgrave, Robert Stack, Connie Stevens, Dick Van Patten, Robert Vaughn,  Shelley Winters, and the like... You get the idea.

Particularly delicious is Heather Locklear's appearance as a defiant beauty pageant contestant who resents her own objectification (lots of Locklear writhing about in ""Flashdance"" sweats, while dirty old men lick their lips; Aaron Spelling's pre-teen daughter Tori also makes an appearance in the Christmas episode (and later appeared in different seasons as different characters)

Not surprisingly, this show makes for great, nostalgic 'Eighties kitsch. The ""gritty"" dramas are often stilted and absurd, with the melodramatic tone that TV studios had refined the decade before, the attitude towards sex is very ""frank"" and ""realistic"", and the love of opulence and glitz oozes out of every scene. This show may be less well-remembered than ""Dallas,"" ""Dynasty"" or ""Miami Vice,"" but it's just as much of its time as those hit shows, and just as deliciously cheesy. Fans of San Francisco cityscapes and architecture will also appreciate the frequent exterior shots and sweeping views of the ever-changing city skyline... In short, a nice glimpse back.

3858096,4,B00274SIVA,"I am writing this review only to mention that the original pilot starring Bette Davis is included, but her presence is not mentioned anywhere in the set, not on the back, or inside with the guest stars. Ok she is not a guest star because she was supposed to be a permanent role but you would think someone could have added her name on the packaging? I only bought this for her :)",1248739200,6,379,4.205479452054795

Cramer) was basically a land-based&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Boat/dp/B000Z6GT18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Boat</a>&nbsp;set at San Francisco's opulent St. Gregory Hotel (utilizing exterior shots and modeled interiors of real life Fairmont Hotel San Francisco) featuring a combo of guest stars along with a regular cast in intertwined stories of primetime soap love, lust and drama (and occasional comedy).

Starring as the St. Gregory Hotel staff was ever-dapper James Brolin (Pensacola: Wings of Gold, Marcus Welby, M.D.) as Peter McDermott, the manager; gorgeous Connie Sellecca (The Greatest American Hero) as Christine Francis, the assistant manager and eventual love interest for Peter; Shea Farrell as Mark Danning, director of guest relations; Nathan Cook as Billy Griffin, ex-con turned chief of security; Michael Spound and Heidi Bohay as newlyweds Dave and Megan Kendall, a bellhop and desk clerk respectively (who themselves would marry in 1988); plus lovely Shari Belafonte (daughter of Harry Belafonte) as Julie Gillette, manager of hotel information. Look for legendary screen star Bette Davis in her first TV series role (pilot only) as St. Gregory owner Laura Trent who, due to illness, was replaced thereafter by her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-About-Eve/dp/B0012KSUTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All About Eve</a>&nbsp;co-star Anne Baxter who took over as her sister-in-law, Victoria Cabot.

A well-made primetime soap done in proven Love Boat style, Hotel was one of the early hits of the 1983-1984 season. It probably didn't hurt that for 4 of its 5 seasons the show originally ran after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dynasty/dp/B0007IO6V4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dynasty</a>&nbsp;on Wednesday nights at 10p. From the excellent cast to the elegant, atmospheric decor of the St. Gregory itself, Hotel oozed with style and class. This is exemplified in the show's regal opening theme by late great composer Henry Mancini (The Pink Panther, Newhart, Remington Steele). Available [at last] on DVD for the first time, Hotel - The First Season is a 6-disc, Full Frame (1.33:1) video, English mono audio set featuring all 22 regular Season One episodes plus the two-hour pilot movie.

We viewed the entire season one DVDs and now want to make reservations for the rest of the series. However, after four years, it appears Hotel has closed its doors for prospective DVD viewers.

It's ashame that those of us who had not seen the series are not able to do so now.  Every episode we saw in the first season had comedy, drama, and crime as part of it.  This allowed you to laugh, cry, and wonder during each show.

All of the weekly stars (Anne Baxter, James Brolin, Connie Sellecca, Shea Farrell, Nathan Cook, Michael Spound, Heidi Bohay, and Shari Belafonte) were attractive, kind, considerate, and competent. It was the type of show that no longer exists--quality, compassion, and enticing.

Yes, I will admit Connie Sellecca was a big reason I watched the show years ago (what a beautiful and attractive woman), but the shows, I think were well written, nothing too deep and you knew there was going to be a nice ending. Additionally for me, with Henry Mancini doing the music (as he did so many TV shows during that era) only adds to the enjoyment.

3858128,5,B00274SIVA,"""Hotel"" is full of 1980's elegance, charm, drama & fun.  It ran for five seasons, from 1983 through 1988.  It's really entertaining to see the multiple guest stars, ranging from Connie Stevens to Englebert Humperdink and Markie Post to Liberace...the casting was diverse, colorful and is now a great trip down T.V, film and music memory lane.  But the continuity and the thing that makes the St. Gregory feel like home are the employees there.  The first season gives just a hint of the attraction between General Manager Peter McDermott and his assistant Christine Francis. Peter is played by James Brolin, who should have the words - They Don't Make 'Em Like That Anymore - added to his name.  That's one good looking man.  Christine is played by the gorgeous Connie Sellecca.  They're pretty, the hotel is pretty, the clothes are pretty; throw in a dash of big hair and you have an Aaron Spelling Cocktail.
There are a variety of stories.  Some are serious, such as the story about abuse within a family (featuring Robert Reed), and another story with Scatman Crothers about racism.  Some are romantic, a Cinderella type story with Emma Samms.  There is the dramatic where Christine Francis is being stalked; the glamorous, an episode that focuses on a model & a runway show (expect lots of good clothes in that one).  Expect some funny moments also, some are intentional, but the unintentional are my favorites.  I wish I had counted how many times Peter McDermott came to blows with someone (and at least once in the middle of the elegant hotel lobby).  He's also involved with a new woman each week - an ex-wife, an ex-girlfriend, someone he meets at a party...  Between all of that and the fist fights, I don't know how he has time to run the hotel.  Another funny moment is when Heather Locklear(looking like a peach & America's 1980's sweetheart), as a beauty contestant, is rehearsing for her talent portion.  It's an unintentionally goofy dance that made me simultaneously laugh, miss leg warmers & think Heather Locklear can do anything and still look adorable.  Ah...the 80's...I miss them.
It's ridiculous that they haven't released more of the Hotel seasons.  This is a great show, and I want the rest!",1329868800,5,2217,4.804749340369393
3858129,5,B00274SIVA,"Welcome to the St. Gregory; your stay here is going to be beyond satisfactory.  ""Hotel"" is one of the reasons I've been yearning for 80's entertainment with its vibrant color, glamorous surroundings and elegantly-dressed, beautiful staff and guests.  It's like taking a mini vacation, and you'll feel like you've spent time in the lap of luxury.

Season one is a great package with 22 episodes and the two-hour pilot.  It's an Aaron Spelling production, so expect some bigger-than-life entertainment.  I miss Mr. Spelling; he knew how to sweep you into another world.  Set in San Francisco, the shots are beautiful inside and outside.  T.V. shows now seem mostly to be shot through some kind of gray filter with everything being gritty.  ""Hotel"" is just the opposite.

The regulars: James Brolin, Connie Sellecca, Anne Baxter, Heidi Bohay, Shea Farrell, Nathan Cooke, Shari Belafonte and Michael Spound are both featured in stories of their own and also play into stories from guests staying at the St. Gregory.  The guest stars add to the fun.  Look for everyone from Heather Locklear to Tommy Smothers.  Also, several from the cast of ""Dallas"" show up in stories. And movie buffs will love seeing Jean Simmons,Donald O'Connor and Eleanor Parker.

There is the occasional loopy plot:  Shelley Winters playing a nutty woman who has a bone to pick, to put it lightly, with Mrs. Cabot forces her to participate in a fake trial in her own penthouse.  It only adds to the fun of these shows.  Most of the stories are dramatic (leaving out the loopy side), some are humorous and some romantic.  In season one, two of my favorite episodes are ""Designs"" and ""Tomorrows.""  In ""Designs,"" iconic fashion designer Nolan Miller, who actually did costume design for ""Hotel,"" ""Dynasty"" & ""Hart to Hart"" appears in one storyline featuring gorgeous clothes and models.  In ""Tomorrows,"" they take a page from ""Cinderella.""  The lovely Emma Samms plays a young woman who meets a dashing royal, who just happens to be holding a ball at the St. Gregory.  I also love the romantic/sexual tension between Peter (James Brolin) and Christine (Connie Sellecca).  They make a gorgeous couple.

My only complaint is that Paramount/CBS hasn't come out with seasons 2-5 yet.  Hopefully, they'll release the rest of this highly recommended series.  Not to sound like Adrienne Barbeau's drug-addicted character, Barbara, in the ""Tomorrows"" episode, but I have to have them!

Isn't it time you had a vacation?  I can't think of a better place to take it than the St. Gregory!",1327276800,6,2543,4.964454976303317

3858131,5,B00274SIVA,"Hotel is still just as great, as it was the very first time it appeared on TV. I enjoyed every episode of the The First Season.
I only have one question.  When will the next Four Seasons be released for purchased? This is one of my favorite series from the Late Mr. Aaron Spelling.",1316995200,7,281,4.203703703703703

3858133,5,B00274SIVA,"So happy that season 1 got released but it has now been two years and I doubt we'll soon see the remaining seasons. I personally blame the price: I think CBS marketed this DVD release at too high a price. Shame as it is a really thoroughly enjoyable show to watch.

Please release subsequent seasons at an affordable price!!!",1300665600,7,325,4.508474576271187

3858135,5,B00274SIVA,"This show is great. Was great. Well, great for a mid 80s TV show. It is sort of a mix between Dynasty, Love Boat, and Heart to Heart or something. I used to watch this in re-runs when I was a teenager and seeing it again after all these years has been lots of fun. The stories are interesting, the characters likable and the fashion...seeing all that sparkly, Halston-inspired 80s fashion that is just starting to be in again is amazing. The stories, like i said, are interesting, but alas only if real life played out like this. I mean here you have a bunch of really good people running this place and they treat others and each other with so much humanity. For example, they let a stranded artist stay in the Presidential Suite free of charge and the assistant to the manager gets her job (without a degree and experience) by sneaking into the office and telling 200 applicants that there won't be any interviews; the hotel owner personally backs up a hooker who has been raped and brings charges against a financial giant...it just goes on and you think to yourself, wow, this isn't even real; until you realize that it could be and how much of a better place this world could be if people were nice to each other and said yes and gave you opportunities etc.

Today, or in real life, you get turned down for the job even if you do have the qualifications and if you pull off what Connie Sellecca did then you will probably not only not get hired but also sued; no one let's you stay even in the broom closet for one night for free, much less the Presidential suite and no business owner risks his business and reputation to stand up for the rights of a prostitute. But in this TV show, they do...and that's what it's about: it's sort of like Fantasy Island meets Love Boat in a Hotel. I think it's about possibilities and most shows in the 80s were like that.

Today it's all about vampires, werewolves and terrorism and social causes and -isms in general. Watching a ""cheesy"" show (for today's standards) is refreshing; it is easy fun and light entertainment and it always puts a smile on my face for some reason.",1288483200,15,2118,4.4282051282051285
3858136,5,B00274SIVA,"I loved this series in the 80's. Now, nearly thirty years later, I find it is just as good as I remembered. Heidi Bohay and Connie Sellecca have always been high on my favourite ladies list. To even things up, James Brolin was excellent. Like most of the other reviwers, I would love to have subsequent series. Why are we not being listened to ?

3858137,5,B00274SIVA,"Excellent TV series from the mid eighties. Now I can finally watch some of the episodes that never have been shown on German TV.

But how much longer do we all have to wait for season 2?
It's quite a while now since season 1 has been released and according to the other reviewers there is enough demand for the 2nd season and the 3rd and 4th season as well!

PS: It's December 2011 now and more than two years later the second season from ""Hotel"" is still not out. Why???",1282176000,9,471,4.164835164835165
3858138,4,B00274SIVA,"Originally crafted by producer Aaron Spelling as a land-bound companion to ""The Love Boat"", HOTEL operated in much the same way, with a parade of celebrity guest stars checking in, week after week, for glittery drama at the fictional St. Gregory Hotel in the heart of San Francisco.

Unlike ""The Love Boat"", though, the regular cast members took prominent roles in the storylines; and the show's later timeslot afforded writers the opportunity to give a darker, far more serious edge to the material.  James Brolin starred as the St. Gregory's affable manager Peter McDermott; Connie Sellecca is his lovely assistant Christine Francis.  The regular ""staff"" includes Shea Farrell, Heidi Bohay, Michael Spound, Shari Belafonte and Nathan Cook.

In the original movie-length pilot episode, Bette Davis added gravitas to the proceedings, playing the St. Gregory's owner, Mrs Laura Trent.  Davis was to continue as part of the cast for the main series, but after suffering a severe stroke, she was replaced (quite ironically) by her dear friend and ""All About Eve"" co-star Anne Baxter.  Baxter plays Trent's sister-in-law Victoria Cabot, but for all intents and purposes the roles are interchangeable.  Baxter's cultured, warm Mrs Cabot is the glue that holds the early seasons together (Baxter sadly passed away during production on the third season).

Originally following ""Dynasty"", HOTEL was a solid ratings winner.  It's fun to see some stars from ""Dynasty"" checking into the St. Gregory (Emma Samms, Heather Locklear, Bo Hopkins and Lloyd Bochner all feature in the debut season, not to mention ""Dallas"" favourites Charlene Tilton, Steve Kanaly and Ken Kercheval!).  This first year also includes the likes of Nanette Fabray, Hermione Gingold, Shirley Jones, Jack Gilford, Hope Lange, Connie Stevens, Leigh Taylor-Young, Lynn Redgrave, Paul Burke, Martin Landau, Carol Lynley, Eleanor Parker and Barbara Parkins.

Let's hope Season Two isn't far away!  80's TV gloss at it's best.
