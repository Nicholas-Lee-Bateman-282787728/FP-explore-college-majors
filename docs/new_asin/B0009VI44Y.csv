8067403,4,B0009VI44Y,"The story of Vert Wheeler and his racing friends that began in ""Hot Wheels World Race"" and ""Hot Wheels Acceleracers: Ignition"" continues here.

""Vert"" Wheeler and the rest of the Teku racing team must work with their rivals the Metal Maniacs to drive in the ""Racing Realms"", other dimensional race tracks that test a driver's racing skills to their extreme limit. Whoever reaches the finish line of each realm first receives an ""Accelercharger"", which grants the user's vehicle a special power (frictionless driving, hyperspeed, etc). Scattered throughout the realms are ""Hyperpods"", which the driver's car can attach to give it special abilities as well.

Unfortunately, the evil Gelorum has obtained the Wheel Of Power (see the Hot Wheels World Race DVD) and her robots will stop at nothing to obtain all the Accelerchargers!! If they do, they will be able to take over the world, which is NOT a good thing for us humans!

Not only that, but a mysterious THIRD racing team, the Silencerz, have shown up! Who (and what) are they, and are they on the side of good or evil?

This episode does a great job of propelling the main storyline, as well as moving along several subplots. It's always fun to watch adventures with the Hot Wheels drivers as they take on Gelorum and her drones on fantastic race tracks.

A lot of the reservations I had about the Hot Wheels Acceleracers : Ignition release are not as strong here.

- The Teku and Metal Maniacs now appear more as rival racing teams (which they should have been anyway) as opposed to rival street racing gangs.

- The physical violence content has been reduced as well. There's nothing on this disc that resembles the opening sequence of the Ignition DVD when Dr Tezla was attacked by the drones.

My children enjoy this DVD, and look forward to future Hot Wheels Acceleracers DVDs.

The Cartoon Network has already broadcast the third part of the Hot Wheels Accceleracers saga, Breaking Point, and will be airing the fourth episode ""Hot Wheels Accceleracers: The Ultimate Race"" on October 1st of 2005. If you missed part 3, they usually rebroadcast them the day before the new episode, so look for it on Friday, September 30, 2005.

This DVD comes with 6 micro-episodes, that contain racing and plot elements in realms not shown in the main movie (the Cliffside Realm and the Ice Realm).
