8296517,4,B001E55X9S,"Particularly Chomsky, Sowell, Wolfe, Kissinger, Nixon, Ginsberg and Kunstler.  Kunstler and Chomsky provide wonderful examples of skillfully staying engaged in a debate that is more or less rigged against them.",1455580800,,210,6.0
8296518,5,B001E55X9S,"The best Buckley interview with Tom Wolfe, who by this point had shed any reluctance to embrace an individualistic, iconoclastic and essentially conservative view. Funny, insightful, Wolfe at his most expansive.",1431734400,,211,5.838709677419355
8296519,5,B001E55X9S,"There was bad architecture before Gropius and van der Rohe in the US, certainly, but I think with the European imports America imported a brittleness of opinion. Modernist architecture can barely stand to be criticized. It is also self-hating: instead of admitting its ""bourgeois"" origin and sympathies, it erects two shield: one a false identification with the other-assigned proletariat, the other a shrill insistence on ""true to the materials"" that acted as a very poor aesthetic and practical defense.

8296520,4,B001E55X9S,This is a great interview with two very intelligent and erudite thinkers. The interview is sufficiently in-depth and surveys the fundaments and evolution of modern architecture in an engaging style with valuable insights.,1369180800,2,221,5.7272727272727275
8296521,2,B001E55X9S,"In this episode of Firing Line, WFB interviews Tom Wolfe about his book From Bauhaus to Our House.  This isn't the best Firing Line and does little or nothing to expand on the experience of reading the book.  If you want Firing Line, try a different episode; if you want architecture, read Wolfe's book instead; if you want Wolfe, Ben Wattenberg's Think Tank interview with him is available online for free...",1262822400,7,409,4.746478873239437
