561962,5,6303114946,"As far as content goes, this movie is amazing.  Terrific story based on the real life of a chess master.  Many heartwarming moments and great acting.  My only beef is that Amazon makes it such a pain to play this on devices that aren't Amazon devices.",1494720000,,251,4.413043478260869
561963,4,6303114946,"This is a very heartwarming, well-made classic. I'm not a chess player but I do appreciate strategy. But it's not really about that, like lots of these reviews say. I loved the two contrasting teachers of Josh - how they both had very valuable wisdom to offer him, even if the two views seemed contradictory. I also love the mother's character. This is a great film about parents and their challenges in making choices for their gifted child in the modern world, too. These parents are loving and impressive, but not perfect or all-knowing. Neither are they any kind of abusive stereotype, as other movies might go. Sweet film. Cheesy? Predictable? Maybe a little, but still rewarding.",1494460800,,685,4.863247863247863

561998,5,6303114946,"A fantastic film about the natural gifts of a boy that come face to face with the weaknesses of adults who have lost their way. Josh remains true to himself throughout this amazing tale. Nothing ever breaks his spirit, or drive, to remain himself, regardless of all of the expectations swirling around him. A good message that has been forgotten by too many people caught up in their own vicarious visions of something that they could never be.",1493164800,,444,4.705128205128205
561999,5,6303114946,"This is far more about parenting than Chess, albeit chess is the vehicle for the lessons.  It was most interesting to watch talented acting based upon quality script.  It was interesting to see the two major and opposing schools of thought for playing chess being impressed on ""Josh.""  This movie shows how parenting a child with a gift can push parents so hard that they push their child into missing childhood.  I have seen many interviews where gold medal champions in numerous sporting endeavors state they never really had a ""normal"" childhood as they were ALWAYS being forced to work on their skill.  I do not care much for chess but that was NOT a problem for enjoying this movie!  Superb movie for adults...I seriously doubt many children would appreciate it.",1493164800,4,767,4.816793893129771

562001,5,6303114946,"No car crashes or superheros. No special effects or spaceships or cgi.  It's about a boy playing chess.  Just chess.  And it's one of the best movies I've ever seen.  A fantastic gem, the type of movie you just see much of anymore.  Just a wonderful film.",1492992000,,255,4.340425531914893
562002,5,6303114946,"Full of drama, an amazing score...not to mention a script that will dig to the depths of the human heart. A quintessential 90's movie. And yes, you don't need to know or be familiar with chess to understand and enjoy the movie. All you need...is a heart. I love movies of today. But they just don't make movies like they used to.",1492992000,,329,4.32258064516129
562003,5,6303114946,"Timeless! For a movie from the early 90's I was amazed and captivated at how inspirational, uplifting, and moving this movie was. It resonates into not just chess, but all competitions. Once you can take a step back from the focus of 'winning' and play to your own beat, that's really winning.",1492732800,5,293,4.653846153846154
562004,5,6303114946,"Ostensibly chronicles the development of a child chess prodigy.  Along the way it stirs thought about parenting and child development, the role of public schooling, risk vs risk aversion, the virtues of being unpredictable, winning vs losing, the loneliness and fear of being at the top where the only movement is downward, friendships across class and race....

562132,5,6303114946,"Fascinating biopic delving into competitive chess, relationships and life lessons for the young boy who people thought would be the next Bobby Fischer.  The movie highlights the tension between an individual's talent and honoring who they are.  It demonstrates how the influence of others can take you to greater heights or cause you to sabotage yourself.  All of us are influenced by others.  The questions we have to ask are:  Where is that influence taking us?  And, is that acceptable?  For an interesting story and to discover things that can improve your life I highly recommend Searching for Bobby Fischer!",1472947200,,613,5.07

So when Iknew about the release of this film I ran to watch it. Many years after, (This evening) I returned to watch it and I felt it with the same freshness and warm heat respect 1993.

Joe Mantegna, Ben Kingsley, Lawrence Fishburne and Joan Allen made a superb crew in order to make of this picture, a classic by onw right.

More than a rewarding film: a true life experience!!!",1468108800,,591,4.3545454545454545

562251,4,6303114946,"Theres a certain timeless quality in Searching for Bobby Fisher. Forget for a moment that the subject matter is chess-a sport many people don't have the patience for and the main subject is a child prodigy something few parents will ever raise. Searching for Bobby Fisher is above all else, a father/son story of a father who finds something that he can bond with his son overthe game of chess.

Yet this bonding can also prove to be a burden because it creates conflict such as what it means to be a kid and whether the son is really living out the dreams of a father. There are these tensions between variations on the chess game and whether to devote all energies to becoming the greatest chess player ever or have a normal life. The core family dynamic stretches which is difficult to watch as a reader, but most people should see a certain humanity in the characters that leaves viewers engaged.

When one has those types of dynamics, the subject matter of the film could be badminton and no one would care.",1461715200,3,1012,4.524590163934426

562318,5,6303114946,"You don't have to love chess to love this movie. It's well-acted, well-written, and incredibly touching.

But as a retired tournament chess player, I want to mention how insightful this movie and the book upon which it was based actually are about the world of competitive chess. It's based on a true story, of course, and I appreciate how hard the movie works to faithfully represent what high-level scholastic chess is really like. I've been there with the stress, the fear of losing, the seemingly all-important intensity, and the utter lack of understanding from outsiders. It's a bit oversimplified in the movie, but I've been there with the blitz chess mentality versus positional study dichotomy.

I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a good, intense, well-made drama, whether or not they care at all for chess.

I also recommend it to anyone who wants to understand a bit better what the world of tournament chess is really like.",1456358400,13,949,4.955974842767295
562319,5,6303114946,"Excellent movie. It led me to do a little research. Josh apparently became one of the top young players in the world in the mid 90's (#1 in US and 4th in international under-21), then quit competitive chess in 2001 to focus on martial arts, which has become his life. I've read some reports that say he just burnt out on chess and realized he didn't want to dedicate the rest of his life to it, though some folks speculate he'd gone as far as his talent and temperament would let him (he's a nice guy and world class chess players need to have a killer instinct).

Personally, I think it's incredible that he left the game that had defined his entire life to do something he loved. I wish more of us had that kind of courage, including me. What an amazing person.",1455926400,,763,4.298611111111111

Kingsley is nothing like Pandolfini in real life, but brings a superb performance and quiet intensity to the part.  Chess games are sped up to add drama, but that's to be expected.  There's great performances from a sterling cast, including cameos by Josh Mostel, Austin Pendelton, and a pre-Monk Tony Shalhoub.  Pomeranc is wonderful as the young Josh Waitzkin. It's probably the best movie made about chess (not that there's many, mind you) but also about how a parent handles his child's competition so it's applicable to most parents with a childs in any kind of competition, whether sports or music or art.",1448496000,,695,4.905982905982906

562449,4,6303114946,"great cast, well-written, well-acted -some dramatic license taken with this mostly true story about a young NYC raised chess prodigy-not Bobby Fischer.- one glaring note- Sir ben kingsley (usual marvelous) is shockingly miscast as real-life chess coach, acclaimed chess author and national  master (?)  Bruce Pandolfini. Some of the scenes involving kingsley are so laughably melodramatic that they almost spoil the whole movie. There are  some minor chess tournament -related errors but I don't want  to nit-pick

SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER: Josh (Pomeranc) is seven years oldtime for baseball, thinks his sportswriter dad Fred (Mantegna). But Josh is fascinated by chessand hes a natural. Dad takes him to Bruce Pandolfini (Kingsley), once Bobby Fischers coach, but now tending a rundown chess club. Pandolfini watches Josh play and sees the intuitive sense that made Fischer a world champion. He disciplines, tutors and mentors Josh with stern intensitybut Josh has more fun playing speed chess in the park with Vinnie (Fishburne), a jive-talking, street-smart player who teaches him the wild side of the sport, like how to psyche out his opponents.

Josh begins winning tournaments, and everything is greatuntil a New Kid appears on the circuit. Hes arrogant, ruthless, obnoxiousand a virtual chess machine. In the midst of a crisis of confidence, can Josh beat him? And if so, at what cost to his delicate spirit?
Discussion: Based on the real-life story of Josh Waitzkin, its ultimately not about a kid at all. Its about the problems we all have dealing with adult concerns, facing pressure by adult self-interests, and our own fears of failure. Its about how we all make wrong moves in playing the gamenot chess, but life.

Josh is the focal point of this Jungian quaternity of personified personality functions: victory-oriented Dad is the sensation function; Vinnie, the feeling/emotional; Bruce, the thinking/intellectual; Mom, the intuitivethe only one among them with insight enough to recognize Joshs decency is not weakness, but innocenceand is to be protected at any cost. Josh eventually proves his intuitive artistry by integrating the strengths of each of his quartet of teachers and transcending the limitations of all of them.
Pomeranc is determinedly unprecocious; one small part of what makes Josh such a charmer. Atmospheric photography and Oscar-caliber performances by all enhance this intelligent, sensitive and spirit-affirming film, at once warm, witty and wise.",1422921600,2,2231,5.174515235457064
562667,5,6303114946,"This is one of those rare films that stays with you, but without it being one individual element of the film that causes it.. There are no histrionics, no action scenes, it's not a comedy, nor a romance. And yet it is a love story. It is an ode to human appreciation, and to the fragility of the human mind. It is also a battle for the truth and balance of life. This film boasts an ensemble of great actors, where all the leads are magnificent, and magnificently understated. Laurence Fishburne as the inspirational street punk chess hustler, and Ben Kingsley as the emotionally shell-shocked ex-chess champion, deliver forcefully restrained performances, and Joe Mantegna delivers whirlwind of feelings as the father. But Max Pomeranc strides with assurance into his portrayal of seven year old Joshua, the chess prodigy. Watch out for some interesting cameos too.",1421884800,,866,4.979310344827586

Tight script, excellent performances by all, poignant voice-over, timeless story made compelling by focusing closely on the individual characters' foibles and ultimate nobility. The eerie portent of a flawed life and Joan Allen's character's fierce vigilence of her son's goodness ups the ante for any character development and the unfolding dramatic denouement.  The script delivers flawlessly.  Every actor is perfect; no word, nuance, or scene is superfluous. Obviously, you could say I liked it. So, WHERE IS THE BLU-RAY? In fact, WHERE IS THE DVD? All that is available other than streaming format is some burned-hacked copy that freezes up at the end every time I watch it. Lousy quality, unacceptable.",1413331200,,725,5.350877192982456

562978,5,6303114946,Excellent,1411516800,,9,9.0
562979,2,6303114946,"This is a well done movie, but for all of it's attempts to show the problem of parents who pressure their kids to 'win' at all costs, the film itself takes the same view. At the end, instead of consoling the other child with the words ""It's okay to lose, you Dad loves you anyway, it's just a game', we hear 'Can I tell you a secret? You're much better than I was at your age.""

And they changed the ending from what happened in real life, in fact, the two chidlren ended up sharing the championship, but God FORBID the young hero doesn't WIN. The adults standing there breathlessly waiting to see if he wins the championship, and they have to make his young opponent into a bit of a 'bad guy.' Not true to life, and still gives out the message that if you don't 'win' you are nothing.

I'm assuming the book was better, but I think it's a cautionary tale in reality. After all, for all the adulation of Bobby Fischer, in truth he was obsessed with chess as a way to cope with his isolation and lonliness, living in semi-poverty, his Mom gone most of the time, moving from place to place. She just wasn't a good Mom.

The FBI was actually investigating her, since she was a member of the Communist Party.

Her fears about this translated into Bobby's later paranoid/mental illness, and in fact, after he became World Champion, his mental state only deteriorated over the years.

That's why it was hard to sit there and listen to the 'teacher' telling the young hero about how dedicated Bobby was-he wasn't dedicated, he was obsessed, it was the way he stayed sane during his sad childhood.

When will we as a society stop using children to fulfill our ego driven urges to 'win', and when will we stop thinking of things as 'win' or 'lose'. We are out of whack in that way, and while the film brought up this issue, probably as this was the topic of the book, it showed it's betrayal to the essence of that theme time and again.

Why did they change the ending so that our young hero wins??? They are as guilty as anyone else of exploiting a child.",1411516800,2,2047,4.342931937172775

But for me, one of the most underrated aspects of the movie is the mother's character.  Father and instructor are teaching him to win and to be ruthless, winning is the goal.  But the mom is powerful in protecting young Josh's heart, how can you nurture compassion and having a good heart when you are being bombarded with ""win! win! win!"", then to protect her son knowing he's still a little boy and he as such let him have his youth.  The mom is the strongest character of the whole movie and it flys under the radar unless you are really paying attention.",1408579200,,673,4.537190082644628

set by Former World Champion Bobby Fischer, hence the movie's title.  As is so often the case, words such as prodigy were
thrown around, and this was the mantle placed on young Josh.  The heir apparent.  The movie deals with the struggle of young
Josh not only to succeed in a very competitive sport, but to grow in meaningful warm relationships with his friends, fellow competitors, chess coach, father, and others.  And grow and mature he does, sometimes to the angst of parental figures who
strive for ""winning"" over long term relationships and caring for others. Coach  GM Bruce Pandolfini is unfairly characterized as some kind of overdriven  nut (at least in one scene). I hope every parent gets the importance of balance as described by Josh's father

I finally caught it on the Sundance Channel and have watched at least 3 times now. This film was worth the wait. Let me tell you. This is a great film. You don't have to like Chess. You don't even have to play Chess. Yes, this film lets you into that world that I was once part of, but better yet, it separates men and boys who have that higher level of insight into the game, it separates them by their passion and honor and dedication for the game and for those mere mortals who play the game on that same field. What is the purpose of the game? I think the film asks that question. And I think the film answers it aptly. I remember once at a tournament that I offered my opponent a draw even though it was evident that I had clearly beaten him. I overheard that if my opponent did not win or draw he was off his school's team. When I watched SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER that all came back to me. That is what this excellent film is about.",1381276800,2,1112,4.082191780821918

He most certainly doesn't radiate I'm a child star, look at me. The marjority of his charisma is those expressive eyes and well portrayed empathy for not only his own family but all those he meets.
  Even if led out by a excellent director this boy needs the core for which he may draw and he rises to the challenge without crossing over to maudlin while retaining a strength far beyond his years.
 Especially touching is his part time friendship with one of his weekly chess mates and some rather intense scenes between him, his father, and his coach.
No less spectacular is the battle between parents over what's best for our mite sized chess prodigy.

This was an intellectual subject, but the writing was not - it ended up being a cookie cutter, child savant film applied to a new subject area. Too many jarring changes in direction from the main characters interrupted the suspension of disbelief - the father shouting at the boy's teacher for example did not fit with his previous characterisation. Analyse the dialogue to see what we mean - bland at best - nothing to make you feel that the writer had depth or was going to demonstrate depth - just lots of lingering, arty visuals as we have come to expect in more modern times. Ben Kingsley's character was creepy actually as a result of long camera shots and no worthy dialogue to justify the intensity. Not profound and, again, jarring changes of direction for his character -switching from talking about chess as an art in one sentence, to 'you've got to hate your opponent' in another - it just sat all wrong.

564765,5,6303114946,"If you are in the mood for a Hollywood feel-good movie, with an appealing protagonist who overcomes adversity and triumphs by ""just being himself"", you can do a lot worse than ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"".  In this case the appealing protagonist is young chess prodigy Joel Waitzkin, well-played by child actor Max Pomeranc. Once Joel demonstrates an unexpected talent for chess, he faces a variety of pressures from adults and other kids and ultimately has to figure out his own path forward.  Many of the adults want him to be the next Bobby Fischer and a world-class chess champion (hence the name of the movie), but the tradeoffs involved in doing so may not be what Joel wants to do.

Pomeranc turns in a surprisingly good performance for a child actor, delivering his lines well and portraying Joel's emotions through appropriate facial expressions.  Ben Kingsley's performance as Joel's chess teacher Bruce Pandolfini is the other noteworthy one.  The filmmakers sprinkle in archival footage of the real Bobby Fischer, and provide an interesting look inside the New York City chess scene.  They also convey the emotion and drama of intense chess matches, which can't be too easy to do on the big screen.  All this, coupled with an engrossing storyline and an appropriate ending, combine to make a feel good family movie that is appropriate for pretty much all ages.

There are some flaws, but they are generally minor ones.  A few of the scenes, such as the confrontation between Joel's father and Joel's teacher, seem a bit contrived and perhaps over the top.  In movies such as this one, which are ""based on a true story"", I always assume that the filmmakers are taking dramatic license to stretch or twist the truth in order to make a better movie.  Who can say if the events in ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" are 100% accurate?  Only a few people.  The rest of us should just enjoy the movie.",1355702400,2,1903,4.800613496932515

Yes, the movie has been dramatized by Hollywood in an attempt to keep the non-chess players in the audience interested.  Being a tournament player myself I can tell you that the last moves in the film between Josh and Jonathan were rushed, like speed chess, and, unless they both were in a time crunch they would never have moved that fast. Slow and methodical wins the day.  Lawerence Fishburn's character was a composite of at least two other influences in Young Josh's life.  Props to Ben Kingsley's acting as the American chess master, Bruce Pandolfini.  However, the real pandolfini is also an advocate of speed chess and probably, also a lover of a variant of that game called ""Bug House.""  The real Bruce P. does show up in a small cameo in the film as the young, mustached spectator watching young Jonathan playing the former Russian Grandmaster in the park.  His line to both Kingsley and ""young Josh"" is ""Another Bobby Fisher.""  All this aside, the feeling of what it's like to play in an actual tournament is shown very well.

564936,5,6303114946,"Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.
Searching for Bobby Fischer is a movie based on the true story of Joshua Waitzkin [Max Pomeranc) A Seven year old boy. He uses chess as a way to analyze carefully the moves and motivations of himself and others.

He is put in a position to care about the game and at the same time make sense of his relationship with his over competitive Father(Joe Mantegna) A particularly avid sports writer, A homeless drug dealer, Vinnie (laurence Fishburne) who plays chess in the local park and a World Renown chess instructor named Bruce Pandolfini(Ben Kingsley).
The movie starts out with an introduction about a Grand Master and  U.S. chess champion Bobby Fischer also a former child chess prodigy. He has disappeared and thus the search for him is what drives the motivation of others. Fischer, is the standard by which young Waitzkin is compared and from this reference the rest of the plot unfolds.

The acting is tremendous, every actor is used appropriately and each add to the quality of the story. Particularly Max Pomeranc! Child actors are usually not convincing and I mostly avoid movies that revolve around them.

As a chess player myself I found this movie to be beautifully well written and focuses on the art of the game and uses plenty of popular chess innuendos and complicated algebraic chess notation in honor of those that love the game. It does not insult those who do not understand the intricacies of the game as well.

It accomplishes this by involving you into a story that most of us can identify and relate to. The relationships between a child and adults (who in most cases act more like children than this 7 year old boy.) That premise, is what makes this movie stand on its own two feet with movie audiences and critics alike.
Even to this day, it is a warm heartfelt story that the entire family can enjoy.

I cannot recommend this movie any higher! For those of you who want to walk away feeling uplifted and truly inspired, this movie has passed the tests of time for 17 years. It's hard for me to imagine that it ever will lose in that strategy, because of its universal subject matter.

It will challenge you to put your thoughts and emotions in ""check"" and it successfully keeps them there!",1262649600,3,2291,4.669975186104218

Something sparks in his mind and he becomes obsessed with the game, and soon moves into the world of competitive chess. You don't have know a thing about chess to love this film.

In this case, it's a young boy, played very well by Max Pomeranc. It's also based on a true story which makes you care even more and root harder for the nice kid.

The idea of knocking pushy parents in kids' competition is fine but it's a little overworked here and you also get the normal PC angle in today's films where a black and white is concerned. In this film, it's Max's chess tutors. Those two teachers are the most interesting adults in here, but then again, where have you seen Ben Kingsley and Samuel L. Jackson NOT be entertaining?

Add Joe Mantegna and Joan Allen as the parents and you have a nice cast, along with an involving story and pretty nice photography. Interspersed in this story of a chess prodigy are film clips of the famous and very eccentric Bobby Fischer, whom the movie is named after. Young Pomeranc narrates those segments.

This was one of those truly solid ""feel-good"" movies of its year, which says a lot because 1993 produced an incredible amount of great pictures. Since it's so nicely-photographed, I'd like to see this get a good Blu-Ray treatment, too.",1240272000,,1220,4.665116279069768

What happens when a sportswriter, who has just given his son a new baseball glove for his 7th birthday, discovers that his son prefers chess over baseball. He not only prefers it but he is a child prodigy. He could be another Bobby Fischer. Unfortunately, as we see in flashbacks of Fischer's career throughout the film, being a genius and world champion did not necessarily make you a human success story. The question is: are genius and success as a human being mutually exclusive? Can you be a child prodigy and a 'normal' child? The film does a great job of exploring that question as we see the family struggle with first, Josh's gifts, and then, how to best use the incredible talent he has for visualizing the game of chess. As Josh says to one of his opponents during a match, 'It's over. You just don't know it yet."" Genius sees things the rest of us mortals do not. The acting is superb, the cinematography, especially of the chess tournaments, is amazing, and the degree to which the film addresses the question of genius versus having a life is sometimes heartbreaking.

565172,4,6303114946,"Great movies are never what they seem to be about on the surface, they always touch on larger themes.  ""Searching For Bobby Fischer"" is not about chess, although a lot of chess is played in the movie.  It's not about Bobby Fischer either, although Josh (Max Pomeranc), the movie's central character, mythologizes about him quite a bit (as a player, not, thankfully, in light of some of Fischer's bizarre proclivities, as a person).

This film is about not living vicariously through your children, and having a full and complete life.  The movie's tagline: ""He wasn't afraid of losing a match...just his father's love"" makes the whole affair sound more cloying than it actually is.  Josh Waitzkin is a real person (and still the highest ranked player in the US in his age group) whose father is a sportswriter.  Fred Waitzkin (Joe Mategna), after getting over his initial discomfort at losing to his son in chess, realizes how talented the boy is and arranges for lessons with chess teacher Bruce Pandolfini (played by Kingsley) and, later, signs him up for tournaments where he discovers that, while being a certified prodigy, Josh lacks the killer instinct we generally think that our champions have to have in any competitive endeavor.  How the adults in Josh's life cope with this, and how they help him cope with it, forms the core of the movie.

How Steven Zallian (who wrote the screenplay for Schindler's List, also released in '93, but directing for the first time here) managed to get this cast I'll never know.  Mantegna is a Tony award winner (for Glengarry Glen Ross), Ben Kingsley is an Academy Award winner, and Joan Allen and Laurence Fishburne are Academy Award nominees and those are just the lead roles.  In addition, Laura Linney, William H. Macy, and David Paymer also went on to become Academy Award nominees and people like Tony Shalhoub, Dan Hedaya, and Anthony Heald turn up in small parts.  Needless to say, the performances are outstanding.

But it doesn't stop there--the talent behind the camera is equally as impressive.  The Producer is Scott Rudin (who accepted the Oscar for Best Picture this year for No Country For Old Men) and the film was exec produced by Sydney Pollack.  Two time Academy Award winner (for American Beauty and The Road To Perdition) Conrad L. Hall is the movie's Director of Photography and, like any movie he ever shot (Butch Cassidy and The Sundace Kid, All the President's Men), the film is absolutely gorgeous to look at.  Even the film's composer, James Horner, is an Oscar winner (for Titanic).

In the that's-kind-of-cool department, real life chess champions (Joel Benjamin and Kamran Shirazi to name a few) turn up as themselves and the real Bruce Pandolfini and Katya Waitzkin (Josh's sister) have cameos.

The film handles the questions on the importance of winning and the sacrifices it sometimes entails (nobody would want to have lived Bobby Fischer's life) with grace and sensitivity.  Add it all up and you have a wonderful gem of a movie, one that isn't just for chess lovers.

This particular DVD release is not a good one--there are no extras of any kind which is odd since even the VHS version of the movie had some extras.  Still this is a movie to treasure.",1205020800,2,3234,4.824275362318841

565177,5,6303114946,"I watched this movie several times when I was a kid and I remember liking it. I will admit that I loved chess and that probably made me biased towards it.

Two days ago I watched it again for the first time in maybe a decade. And there's a question that I've been asking myself: Now that I'm an adult and not that interested in chess do I like it as much now as I did when I was a kid?

Honestly, no. I like it even more now. And that's because this film is not really about chess. It's about life. It's about the people who influence us, our fears, our struggles, respect and even compassion towards each other, and trying to decide what really is important in our lives. Knowing a little bit about chess might enhance your pleasure in the film but it also might not: chess is really only the context of the story.

This film also has what seems like flawless acting. The actor who plays the chess genius Josh (Max Pomeranc) might have given the most believable performance any kid has ever given in any movie. Ever.

Of the 38 films that I have reviewed so far, there is no film that I recommend more than Searching for Bobby Fischer. I may not be as good at chess as I once was but for your next move, I have a strong recommendation: buy this film.",1188691200,3,1251,4.178423236514523
565178,3,6303114946,"My rating is based on how I feel about the film, but I'm writing this review to set a few things straight. First of all, there are two people portrayed in the film that are really ill-served by it: Josh's rival, who's real life name is Jeff Sarwer, and Bruce Pandolfini. Far from the brooding, dark-stepchild demeanor of the rival character in the film, Sarwer was actually a very lively, energetic, happy-go-lucky boy. Probably more importantly: he did not actually lose the 1986 primary championship game to Josh Waitzkin. The game was a draw and the young players shared the championship. In fact, Josh has never beaten Jeff Sarwer; they played twice in tournament, with Jeff winning the first game and Josh drawing the second that year. Also, Josh Waitzkin was two years older than Jeff at the time (Josh 9, Jeff 7.) There is much information now on the Internet about Jeff Sarwer, including a TV special produced about him before he was placed in foster care and dropped out of chess, available on Youtube, as well as the actual games he played against Josh, which fans of ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" might avail themselves to peruse.

Second, Bruce Pandolfini taught both children. He was also at least twenty years younger than Ben Kingsley in the film, not Irish, and much taller. And to the best of my knowledege, Pandolfini never resorted to silly, melodramatic tactics like sweeping the pieces off the board in front of an eight year old student and asking him to find the mate-in-four. (Since Pandolfini has a cameo in the film I assume, however, that it had his approval.)

Finally, one of the major themes in the book is the relative poverty and squalor that chess players live and work in in this country because Americans don't take chess seriously. (Or didn't at the time?) This topic is repeated almost to a fault in the book, yet the film's settings are all ninteenth-century mansions or churches. You'd probably have a hard time getting real estate like that in New York even if you were Microsoft. Try this sentence from the beginning of chapter 5: ""Beyond a door padded against slamming with wads of newspaper and silver duct tape, the best players were in a sorrowful front room over a pizza parlor, with discolored wall paneling, peeling paint, torn rugs and electrical wires dangling from holes in the ceiling.""

For those reviewers who thought that the film was inspiring and taught important lessons about life: it is just a movie. It has very little to do with life except being able to make a lot of people feel squishy inside. The movie has even less to do with chess.",1187568000,12,2600,4.722466960352423
565179,5,6303114946,"This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time !!! It makes you happy, sad ,it makes you cry and it  is an excellent example of how family life should really happen. It also makes you think. I loved it. It's exceptional.",1187136000,3,235,4.0
565247,5,6303114946,"This movie tells the story of Josh Waitzkin and it is based on the book with the same title written by his father. If you have read the book, you will certainly notice that the adaptation for the movie was flexible and does not really follow he facts, but it sure does make the story more exciting.

The film starts at the time after Bobby Fischer withdrew from the international chess scene and went into seclusion. After winning his title, Fischer had many disagreements with FIDE (International Chess Federation) and  did not show up to defend his title against Karpov. As a result, he lost the title and left a huge crowd of fans, that had taken up chess after and American defeated the seemingly invincible Soviets, without a hero to carry their flag.

In this setting we find small Josh Waitzkin (Max Pomeranc), who picks up chess from watching people playing in the park and soon shows his innate ability for the game. His parents soon find themselves in unfamiliar territory and have trouble coping with the requirements and stress even young chess players face. In an effort to help their son cultivate his gift, they contact Bruce Pandolfini, one of the most recognized chess coaches in the US (if you go to a bookstore and look for chess books you will see several written by him).

This is when the search for Bobby Fischer within this child begins, and the journey could not be better. Kingsley, Mantegna and Pomeranc are all very good in their roles and give their characters with the right amount of emotion and passion. But if I had to pick a performance, it would be the one by Laurence Fishburne, who plays a character that will remain imprinted in the memory of all those that watch this movie.

The fact that Pandolfini is presented in a slightly negative light, compared to reality and the modification of the end of the story do not really detract from the overall quality of the production. If you love chess, this movie is a must, but even if you do not, I bet you will really enjoy it.",1186012800,4,2010,4.572222222222222
565248,4,6303114946,"I was happy to see this movie released on DVD so I could add it to my collection.  SFBF is an endearing tale, based on a true story, of the discovery of a chess prodigy (who was otherwise a very normal kid) and his learning about the harsh realities of competition.  Joe Mantegna does his usual excellent acting job, lending a particular humor and humanity to the role of the father, but the young actor they sourced for the role, Max Pomeranc, is an acting prodigy.  He's a cute kid, no doubt, but he evinces a certain pathos not normally seen in children his age.  He steps into the role very well.  Primarily a drama/slice of life movie, there are some excellent bits of comedy throughout as well.  The chess scenes are done quite well so you don't get bogged down in it, and even if you've never heard of chess you won't be lost in this movie.  Released in 1993, you'll recognize a lot of other folks in earlier roles (I'd forgotten Laura Linney was in it).  My only complaint is the ""reality"" of some profanity, but you can't escape that it seems, but be forewarned if you're showing it to your own kids who are Max's age in the movie.",1185321600,2,1140,4.34433962264151

565250,5,6303114946,"Coaches, teachers, and parents of kids often make one of two errors in competitive activities:

1. They try to convince their kids that winning is the only thing that matters.
2. They instill in their kids a great fear of losing.

Josh Waitzkin is a young 7-year-old boy who enjoys playing the game of chess.  He's also a very nice, sweet kid who never feels comfortable or even enjoys ""beating"" an opponent.  He simply loves the game.  When he first plays his father in a game of chess, he doesn't try his hardest.  He's afraid of beating and hurting his father's feelings.  This part of the film lays the foundation for the entire rest of the film.  His mother has to tell him, ""it's okay if you beat him.  You won't hurt his feelings.""  Only then does Josh play at his best and wins.

Fred Waitzkin (Joe Mantegna) represents the first fear that I listed.  He's an extremely supportive father who is very proud of his son.  ""He's better at this than anything that I will ever do in my whole life,"" he says of Josh.  While his passion and support are strong, he falls into the trap of living vicariously through his son.  Winning is the most important thing to him.  When Josh loses a match to an ""inferior"" opponent, Fred is upset and can't understand why Josh lost.  He doesn't realize that Josh loves his father and only wants to please him.  It isn't until then that Fred realizes his mistake, and he finally encourages Josh to play for fun.

On the other side is Josh's chess teacher, Bruce (Ben Kingsley).  He represents the second fear that I listed.  He is afraid of Josh losing.  Bruce is a man who is so scarred by his own losses that happened long ago, that he more or less ""hides out"" in an old chess room.  At first, Fred Waitzkin has to talk him into taking his son as a student.  While Bruce's demeanor is somewhat cold, it's obvious that he truly loves Josh, and can't bear the thought of Josh going through the pain of losing a match.  It isn't until the end that he realizes that Josh is really in no danger of this, even if he did lose.  Josh isn't greatly affected by either winning or losing.  He only likes to play.  But, Bruce tries to tell Josh that he needs to hold his opponents in contempt.  That type of notion simply doesn't exist in Josh.

""Bobby Fischer held the whole world in contempt,"" says Bruce.  Josh responds, ""I'm not him.""  Josh already knows who he is, and he isn't trying to be the next Bobby Fischer, no matter how much everyone else wants him to be.  He only wants to be himself.

There are two characters in this movie that already know Josh's heart, and they give him the positive values and support that Josh needs.

First, his mother (Joan Allen).  She is so enamored by Josh's good heart, that at one point, she threatens her husband.  ""He's not weak. He's decent. And if you or Bruce or anyone else tries to beat that out of him, I swear to God I'll take him away.""

Second, is his friend Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne), a man that Josh meets in Washington Square where Vinnie spends his time playing speed chess with other people who are mostly transients.  Josh quickly makes friends with him, even though Bruce doesn't like it.  But, Vinnie holds the wisdom of competition that Bruce fails to give to Josh.  ""You're playing not to lose, Josh.  You have to risk losing.  You have to play on the edge of defeat.  That's where you want to be!""

I can't stress the performance of young Max Pomeranc (Josh Waitzkin) enough.  He seems to know exactly who Josh is, and he plays him with a gentle sweetness that can't be ignored or overlooked.  You see it in his eyes and facial expressions.  He looks at his opponents not as enemies, but simply another kid sitting across from him who could easily be his friend.  Josh has a well-balanced life.  Chess isn't everything to him.  He enjoys doing other things.  Perhaps this is a testament to why his character is so strong.  His opponent at the end, Jonathan Poe, thinks of only chess, and we quickly find that he is a very unhappy and miserable kid.  He's the kind of player that Bruce tries to make Josh, and we are thankful that Josh never goes down that road.

Competition is so strong in our culture.  Most parents, teachers, and coaches fall into these two fears without realizing it.  We push and push, we forget that they are children, and that we need to stress the importance of having fun, being a good sportsman, and being gracious in victory and defeat.  It's truly amazing to find that Josh Waitzkin already realized this at the tender age of 7.  Hopefully, we can begin to pass these values on to our own kids.

Note* - Look for the real Josh and Vinnie during a scene when the movie Josh and Vinnie are playing chess in the park.  The real Josh Waitzkin and Vinnie are talking just in front of Ben Kingsley and Joe Mantegna.",1182643200,8,4832,4.416572077185017

To the suprise of his parents, one day he asks to play at the park, and does well for the first time. From their, his father becomes involved, who is at first amazed at his son being so good, but then turns into an the classic Overbearing pressuring parent pushing josh into ""always winning"".

565252,3,6303114946,"I am longtime chess player who also grew up playing chess in the New York chess scene of the 70""s (as a youth).  I grew up playing in the streets of the ""Time Square"" area.  A black chess hustler by the name of Bobby Dee originated setting up chess tables on the streets.  Players would man the tables and challenge bystanders to a game.  He set-up outside of Nathan's on 42nd street.  He started this because he had been kicked out of the 42nd street Chess House.  This was the 1st time I met ""Vinny"" (played by a miscasted Laurence Fishburne in the film).  His name was Vincent Livermore and he was a preppie type.  They all called him Livermore.  He didn't have a bald head (in fact his hair was always neatly cut), and he always gave me the impression that he had just come from class.  Asa Hoffman (a white chess hustle miscasted in the film} was a highly respected master who was not the neurotic type portrayed in the film, but an accomplished master full of confidence.  He always stayed upstairs in the chess house because he had regular customers coming by.  Charley (who was Bobby Dee's brother-in-law)  worked in the area; and after work he also set up a single board in front of the building where he work (where the New Years Day ball comes down).  When Bobby Dee died of aids,(being very popular with hookers from 8th ave.), another Bobby (called sweetpea) started setting up.  The police never bothered Bobby Dee (as he was a well-known exboxer, and they knew him at the precinct).  After awhile Nathan's complained and Sweetpea mover around the corner to the outside of Bryant Park.  Those that set up (now) inside the park came much later and charged much more money to play.  Sweetpea continued to charged what Bobbie Dee had charged for the house (fifty cent for each 5 -15 min. game, and a dollar  for slow games).  What ever money you played for was between you and the play.  The flee market started setting up outside of Bryant Park also.  The chess playeers started getting harassed by the cops. Two of the one's playing for Sweetpea (a white fellow name Doug and another fellow) decided to set up in the Wall Street area. It was the other fellow's idea (a black guy whose name I've forgotten).  Sweetpea gave it up after awhle and started playing in Washington Square Park where ""Vinny"", and other chess hustlers made their headquarters.  ""Vinny"" was very popular, and white kids from the area got to be good friends with him.  He was a preppie with character (who could also be intimidating when playing masters or grandmasters).  It was well-known that he was gay.  He wasn't flamboyant (and no one ever brought it up), but he never hid the fact either.  He was openly gay in an environment where the issue only came up during his absence.  That's some of the histoy of the otherside of chess.  As for the movie; it's very good otherwise.  I've given you a view from the inside out.  ""Vinny"" later died of aids, but Sweetpea was still there, the last time I looked.  You see him in some of the park scenes (they use the park guys in the film).  The Russian master in the park who talks to himself (who Josh's mother pays a sum of money to play her son a game) was at some point taken to a care facility by some of the neightbors of the park.  In those days it was only beginning to look depressing (that's why I stop going there to play).  You can sight Sweetpea in the following park scene.  Josh is playing ""Vinny"" on one board while Sweetpea (in a blue sweater with light blue shirt collar) plays a white guy (in black leather coat).  Vinny is talking loud while playing Josh.  He saids ""That's what I'm talking about...Make him run.  What can I do...?  By the way the guy who saids ""A young fischer."" is none other than Josh's real life chess teacher Bruce Pandolfini making this comment to Ben Kingsley (who is portraying him in the film).

565256,5,6303114946,"One of my all-time favorite films!

I echo reviewer D. Knouse sentiments (excellent review, by the way) when he said, ""One of the deciding factors I use to determine whether or not I will purchase a DVD is, 'How many times will I want to see this film?' Well, as far as this DVD is concerned I'm nearing the double-digits in viewings.""

I completely concur!

First of all, Josh is just adorable and what the other reviewers have said is so true about the genius of the game and the interplay of the characters.  However, what I found especially appealing is the frustration of the father.  As a father of five, I found myself connecting with this character, Fred (Joe Mantegna).  Fatherhood is an ""on the job"" training experience.  Most people fail to understand how frustrating it is to attempt to be the perfect father. Fred is searching for the right mix; how much to push his prodigy son, when to pull back, etc.  Of course he is frustrated!

I really felt that this film portrays what anyone would say is a typical loving father in a VERY atypical situation without a roadmap to direct his way.  He is trying his best, knowing his best may not be good enough, yet he continues trying!

Personally, I thought that the mother, Bonnie (Joan Allen), simply did not fully grasp the greatness of her son and so unjustly dismissed the coach.

The coach (Ben Kingsley) who was attempting to re-create the genius Bobby Fischer, simply did not realize that an even greater genius sat before him - a genius that could master AND enjoy the game while still maintaining a BALANCED life.  Of course, this realization finally dawns on the coach as he watches Josh's final play of the match.

This film demonstrates that the true victory in life is the friendships and relationships we have one with another.  Victory can be found not in achieving continual successes, but in the value of learning from our defeats and mistakes; for we are human and if success is not always guaranteed in life, failure is inevitable.",1169424000,5,2006,4.643059490084986
565356,4,6303114946,"More than the pressure of winning, real life child chess prodigy, Josh Waitzkin (Max Pomeranc), must guard himself from adult's expectations for success.  His father Fred (Joe Mantegna) makes most Little League parents look tame in comparison.  As a sportscaster he makes Josh feel ill-at-ease with the dimension and topic of his remarkable talent.  Fred finds Josh a determined but pushy and arrogant chess coach (Ben Kingsley).  One key scene is during a parent-teacher conference.  Josh's teacher is concerned that ""the chess thing"" is overtaking too much of Josh's time and interest.  To this Fred is pointed.  He accuses the teacher of belittling him.  It is ambiguous if the teacher wants normalcy, mediocrity, or sanity for Josh, but what is clear is that Fred will have none of it.  He pulls Josh out of his school and places him in a private school where he can take chess classes.  To the film's credit, we see some balance in the father.  Although he tells the teacher that Josh has an opportunity he never dreamed of having, he does talk to Josh about a friend who will be attending his new school. He also has some genuinely heart-to-heart talks--even if they are tainted with his own ambitions.  All the pressure to win hits the poor boy and the audience, for we can feel his pain.  Yet, there are refuges for Josh as well.  His mother, Bonnie (Joan Allen), genuinely puts his welfare first, and Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne) his companion in the park, teaches Josh that his gift is meant to be enjoyed above all else.

After seeing this little gem, I couldn't help but think of the more recent movie 'Akeelah and the Bee'.  Both movies have child prodigies, a nerve-racking family life, and Laurence Fishburne in a key performance.  This film is likable for the story and the parallels between Josh the protagonist and his hero, Bobby Fischer, complete with interweaving clips of the famous chess champion.

565358,5,6303114946,"As others have said this movie is indeed about family values, the price(s) one pays for winning and competition and dealing with devloping your child. Let us take all that as given - there are two other things that, to my mind are the core bedrock and are usually not mentioned in the review. But are in fact central in the script and the message.

The first is seeing beneath the surface of Chess to the emotional and intellectual endeavor it can be, at it's best. As Bruce Pandolfini puts it ""Fischer got beneath the surface of the game line no one else before him"". One doesn't need to understand chess, though it helps, to see that the passionate pursuit of great art is a moment of excellence.

The second is the prices necessary - which differ for us all. So few of us are truly excellent at much of anything, which is probably the reason we applaud those who are. Being able to create great art is a moment of transcendence and the movie shows us the exterior of this about as well as it can be done. But it also shows us how the single-minded pursuit of pure excellence at the price of all the other things that make us worthwhile people is a high price to pay.

It is these othere lessons that are at the heart of this movie and make it truly worthwhile as a great, long-lasting 'see-again' movie. For the whole family.",1157846400,5,1328,4.346774193548387

Though SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER features chess, it's not about this game so much as it is about nurturing a child to grow into his own person. The mysterious disappearance of Bobby Fischer, world chess champion, did leave a void. But does this give family and coaches the right to demand that another child fill that vacancy? Can Josh continue to enjoy chess along with all the other things ""normal"" children do? Or is he destined to become part of a regimented chess-champion making machine?

A poignant point in the movie is made when Josh's coach angrily tells him his behavior is inconsistent with prior champion Bobby Fischer. The prodigy replies, ""Well, I'm not him.""

565413,5,6303114946,"I should say up front that I have never played chess, nor do I understand the game. But I remember being intrigued about the film when I saw the theatrical trailer. Was I intrigued because of the fact that the film was about a young boy with a special gift of a game? Was it the intense images of competition? Was it a curiosity about the game of chess itself and how it was played? Or was it about a deeper struggle within the boy? The answer is all of the above. ""Searching For Bobby Fischer"" is an excellent family film for all. I am living proof that even those who don't know jack about chess will love this movie. It is a movie not just about chess, but about acceptance, the bond of love and friendship, compassion for others, and not being afraid to be who you want to be. The balance of drama with edge-of-your-seat competition makes this a truly remarkable film.

Max Pomeranc plays the young and sensitive Josh Waitzkin, a pint-sized seven-year old with a cute lisp, who becomes fascinated with the ""lower class"" men playing chess in a New York park. He watches the men, his eyes shifting with each move of the pieces. He convinces his mother to go to the park with him, where he plays a game of chess with an older gentleman. It is there that Josh's mother realizes her son has a knack for chess. Also noticing Josh is the fast-talking park chess player, Vinnie (a funny and great performance from Laurence Fishburne) who befriends the boy and eventually teaches him a thing or two about the game. After a match with Josh, Josh's father (played by Joe Mantegna) realizes his son's special gift and enlists the help of a stern but knowledgeable chess teacher named Bruce (played by Ben Kingsley) to make Josh an even better chess master. Bruce sees a young Bobby Fischer in Josh and cannot resist the temptation to take him under his wing and perhaps fill the void that Bobby Fischer left in the country after his mysterious disappearance. Through all the technical strategies of the game being learned, Josh and Bruce develop a good friendship and with Bruce's help, combined with his own special gift, Josh excels in chess tournaments and collects a shiny bundle of trophies. But there may be a test even harder than becoming a grand master of chess.

We've all heard of parents trying to live their dreams through their children, especially when a parent sees a special gift in their child. But what happens when the thrill of competition and the persistent need to win cloud the parents' mind too much? And what happens when a beloved teacher wants you to be a carbon copy of someone or something that you're not? These are tests that run way deeper for Josh Waitzkin than any chess tournament. Josh learns quickly how addictive competition is and how obsessed people can become with a certain game. In his own way, the insightful Josh shows his father and teacher that he is not one of these people who lives and breathes chess like Bobby Fischer did. In the process, Josh pushes his father and teacher's feelings about him and the game of chess to the brink where they find they have to rethink their feelings. It's a matter of what is more important: chess competition, or love? Through it all, the three of them find that they can tolerate losing at chess but cannot tolerate losing something more dear; love and friendship for each other no matter what. There are some truly touching scenes in the film from the lecture Josh receives from his dad in the pouring rain, to the visit from his teacher at the Chicago tournament which comes toward the end of the show. But amongst the competition and drama, there are some nice comic scenes from Vinnie's trash talking against the others in the park, to the scene where the all the parents are literally locked up away from their kids during a tournament because they are so obnoxious, to the humorous appearance by William H. Macy when he offers to get Josh's dad a tuna sandwich.

The climax comes in the huge chess championship at the end of the film where Josh takes Bruce and Vinnie's teachings along with his own style of playing and faces off against another chess prodigy named Jonathan. Jonathan is a boy I feel sorry for in the film. Playing since he was four years old, all Jonathan knows is chess and goes about life with a glazed expressionless look on his face. Perhaps this boy is proof of what living for a game can do to you, especially when you cannot just be a kid.

The acting is terrific. Ben Kingsley, Max Pomeranc and Joe Mantegna give us a very touching and real performance in this film. It's too bad that Pomeranc did not act much since this film because he was a great little actor and very convincing. A nice touch to the movie is the real black and white film clips of a very young Bobby Fischer talking about and playing chess with Pomeranc narrating along. It gives us a bit of the history of the world's greatest chess player and also gives us the implication that people were searching for a new chess hero to fill the void when Bobby Fischer vanished; enter Josh Waitzkin.

""Searching For Bobby Fischer"" is one of those stand-up-and-cheer films that is perfect fun for the whole family with some valuable lessons to be learned as well! This is a movie you'll want to watch time and time again.",1138838400,8,5292,4.53717277486911
565414,5,6303114946,"Not really a movie about Bobby Fischer, but rather the drive in the chess community to find the next prodigy who will take the Chess world by storm.

Bobby Fischer began to play chess at the age of 7.  His meteoric rise to winning the national Championship in his early teens and then going on to defeat the World, is the Highlight of US Chess History.

Chess, like Soccer, is much bigger in the rest of the world than it is in the US.  Fischer caused a blip in the radar screen that elevated Chess in the US.  The Chess community has since then been on the look-out for the next prodigy in hopes of repeating the same event.

That's really not the main thrust of the movie, however.  It creates the context in which the relationship between Josh and his Father is explored.  In that regard, the movie is superior and excels.

Bobby Fischer represents the megelomaniac for whom Chess is everything to the exclusion of family, friends and relationships.  (That's really a pretty accurate picture of Fischer the man, by the way.)  Josh rejects that path and chooses instead to retain his humanity, and tender conscience, despite the forces battling for him and his future.

A Father who is tempted to live vicariously through his son's gift is all too common and present in sports and other areas as well.  A coach, who has his own ghosts and demons and recognizes the potential in Josh, who is unable to release him, for fear that he will leave the path of greatness.  Vinnie, the park speed chess player who represents the joy and fun of chess and rails against the establishment who wants to suck the life out of Josh to be their messiah.

It's all there.  The chess provides the back-drop to it all.

Many who have shied away from this movie imagining it to be a dull movie about Chess will be pleasantly surprised when they see it.

Simply an outstanding film and well worth viewing, even if you don't know a bishop from a pawn!",1134777600,6,1931,4.484240687679083

it would be about Bobby Fischer, that the little boy -was- Bobby. I

looking for him & not being able to find him. I didn't want to see a

Fischer is the idol of the little boy, Josh. The movie was quaint, very

90s kid movie. You know the ones, like ""Little Man Tate"" & ""Wildfire,""

or whatever the movie about the girl with the horse was called. Not

bad, not great. Not something I will ever watch again. Joe Mantegna's

character (yes, I know his name is probably misspelled) reminded me of

that sitcom actor, either Raymond or Mencia or some other generic

""guy."" I think it's Raymond. He was very boring in the movie. Ben

Kingsley was, if I remember correctly, the mean chess teacher who threw

Josh's pieces on the ground. I only remember him as the grapefruit-

But again even if you don't know anything about chess, you will really enjoy this movie. Joe Mantegna was excellent, Ben Kingsley was excellent, William H Macy was excellent, Max Pomeranc was really excellent.

565417,5,6303114946,"This is one of Laurence Fishburne's best films even though there are no guns, car chases, or sex.  Fishburne's character is one of quiet strength.  He befriends a child prodigy in the chess world and teaches him lessons in chess and in life.  This is not a large role nor does ""Fish"" have much screen time but when he's on the screen he is captivating.  His role is one of quiet strength but great power.  Josh Waitzkin (the child chess champ) fears not only losing the chess championship but his father's love as well.  Josh trains with Bruce Pandolfini (Ben Kingsly) who himself has his own demons to deal with.  The two teachers don't see eye to eye on chess strategies and that puts Josh in the middle.

You also have the situation of Josh's father who is living vicariously through his son.  Hence, every time Josh wins a trophy, dear old dad puts it in the living room on the mantle instead of in Josh's room where they belong.  Don't let this subject matter scare you away.  You don't have to know how to play chess to enjoy this movie.  It's about the relationships that Josh develops along the way to becoming a grandmaster.  Much of the charm in this film is due to the acting of the newcomer Max Pomeranc.  An innocent face and great big brown eyes that you can't help but emphasize with.

It's heartwarming, funny and sad but also a very powerful film.  This is a real story about real people by the way.  At the time this film was made I believe that Josh was about 18 years old and ranked #1 in his division.  Please watch this film with your kids.

He manages this by maintaining strong connections to the world outside the rarefied atmosphere of chess addicts who live, eat, and breathe the game at the risk of losing touch with all else.  This balance doesn't come naturally, though.  The primary dramatic tension in this film comes from the question of what one owes to one's own gifts-if you are able to perform at the level of genius, do you have an obligation to do so?  To whom is this obligation owed?  And how much should be sacrificed in its name?  This is a powerful film about decent, intelligent people dealing with these issues and emerging triumphant.  This film is packed with terrific actors giving great performances.

565420,5,6303114946,"The worst thing about this movie is that it appears to be about chess.  This is bad only because it might keep people from watching one of the most heart-warming and engrossing movies out there.  And that's a rare combination of qualities to find an a movie.

First, the basic story involves a father dealing with the fact that his son is a prodigy.  And learning that it takes almost as much for the parents to deal with that as the child.  In Canada, this manifests itself in hockey parents who attempt to choke coaches.  In the U.S., it's more likely found in the small town passions surrounding high school sports.  But the feeling is very universal.  Over the course of the move, the father learns how to deal with childhood genius from, of all people, the son.

The engrossing part of the movie comes, unexpectantly, from the chess.  Even if you have never played the game before, the pacing, cinematography and editing of the chess scenes add a tension that rivals many great sports movies (ignoring the 'chess is not a sport argument').  My wife, a person who knows little about the game, also lists this among the movies that we have no problems watching again and again.

565474,5,6303114946,"A cute little boy with a lisp emerges from his toy room to discover that he has masterminded his pawns, kings and bishops by watching a bunch of curbside punks playing chess for money.

Thus begins the gripping saga of Searching for Bobby Fischer, based on the story of an actual eponymous boy, currently considered to be the world's most prodigious chess player under 18.

Don't let the chess bit scare you if you're not familiar with the game. The focus is less on the game itself (although it sure helps you appreciate matters more) and more on the people, their sentiments, the pressures they bring to bear. It's a tale of human trials and triumph, not a sports movie that panders to a certain segment of the population.

And in being so, it probes some very relevant questions. How important are games to our way of life? At what point does the need to win become so important that the game ceases to be a game? Has it become so crucial that we lose sight of the humans playing the game?

We don't easily find the answer to all these questions, but exploring the young player's early career and examining the relationship between him and his victory-obsessed father is rewarding enough.

As I watch the 2004 Athens Olympics and all the non-game stuff that takes center stage in modern sports, I can only heartily recommend this unsung gem of a film to discerning viewers.",1092873600,16,1376,4.6
565475,5,6303114946,"One of the deciding factors I use to determine whether or not I will purchase a DVD is, ""How many times will I want to see this film?""  Well, as far as this DVD is concerned I'm nearing the double-digits in viewings.  This is essentially a Family Film with a great cast of actors such as Laurence Fishburn, Joan Allen, Joe Mantegna, Ben Kingsley, David Paymer, William H. Macy, and a small role by the then virtually unknown Laura Linney.  After that, there are some fine scenes filled with some excellent child acting.  I happen to think any film with good child acting is worth seeing, they are so rare.  The story is well-written and ranges in emotion from humor to borderline outrage and deep-seeded disappointment.  This film actually reminds me of ""The Color of Money"" directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Tom Cruise and Paul Newman.  I got a similar buzz from both films.  After I watch ""The Color of Money"" I feel an unbridled desire to play pool.  After I watch ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" I need to break out my chess board or play on my chess program.  There is even a shot taken directly from ""The Color of Money"" that is used here.  In ""The Color of Money"" there is a great camera shot of a huge room that starts with a shot of the ceiling and gradually pans downward to reveal an empty hall with about twenty pool tables set up for play.  In ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" there is a sweeping camera shot that begins with a dark shot of a hallway ceiling then floats through an archway into a huge, empty hall filled with dozens of chess boards ready for play.  This film did get a single Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography, and with shots like those it is easy to see why.  This is a very solid purchase for anyone, chess fans or no.  There are a couple of scenes that bend towards the over-dramatic for the sense of keeping the story thrilling.  Such as the final chess match, which is not what really happened, but it makes for a more entertaining scene.  I know this because the real Josh Waitzkin helped design my chess program Chessmaster 9000 and his championship games are all listed therein.

The beauty of this film is that you son't realize how beautiful it is untill you watch it a second time, the first time you're too occupied with the story and the sheer ""naturality"" of it, but look at it again, look at the scenes in the boy's bedroom, the first time you saw it you were probably induced into thinking that they got the this kid's room in an actual house and just pointed the camera and shot, the second you realize the excruciating care put into lighting this scene.

This film is quietly sitting around some shelves somewhere, being a genius. The very opening, what with the soft strings carrying some undercurrent of whateverness, along with the opening dialogue (spoken so sweetly by a child no other child can dare out perform) is hair-raisingly impressive.
It's futile. Every second of this movie can be discussed in great detail: the technical musings, the psychological gamblings, the musical magnum opuses (becoming so excited by the thought of this movie that I'm no longer making any sense whatsoever), the acting...
It's quiet and it's absolutely genius. The symbolism is beautiful. I'm thinking mostly of the ""Don't move until you see it.""/""I can't see it."" moment, focusing on the pawn, the King.

It has a lot of wonderful points to make about the gifts children have and the way adults have to work to discover them, nurture the child while developing the gifts, teaching the child about using their gifts, but not going too far and not latching onto the child and living through them.
The film is at its most touching when Josh struggles and the adults in his life struggle even more to try and find ways to help him.  Finally, the dad (superbly played by Joe Montegna) lets Josh off the hook and takes him fishing.  Josh then returns to competition and can take possession of his gift and competitiveness on his own terms.
In real life, Josh Waitzkin has been a superb, but not dominant chess player, but I gather he has led a happy life which should be enough for everyone and is really the point of things, not gathering trophies or empty titles.  Josh learns a bit about the cruelty of real life competition in a painful but not destructive way.
Yet, of course, the film has the final crisis against a very threatening opponent.  I am sure you can figure out what happens.  But this final scene isn't really the message of the movie, it is just the ending.
Laurence Fishburne has a great role he plays wonderfully.  Joan Allen is great as the loving and intelligent mother who is protective but not over protective.  And Ben Kingsley plays Bruce Pandolfini who is the teacher of Josh.  I do not know what was made dramatic for the movie and what is drawn from real life.  But it doesn't matter.

He has found a wunderkind in Josh, who in a very short time, has the vision to see 20 moves into the game (something only Masters can do), but lacks the killer instinct. Josh just wants to play the game. Lawrence Fishburn plays the drug addict Central Park player who teaches Josh that the game is all about The Game.
The film portrays the difference between what drives adults to succeed at life, and what drives a child just to fit in. Flawlessly infused is actual footage of Bobby Fisher playing multiple players, while Josh narrates Bobby's expectations and ultimate mental breakdowns.

565565,5,6303114946,"A heart-warming, feel good movie that introduces you to Josh Waitskin (Max Pomeranc), a 7-year-old chess enthusiast. Not only is he enthusiastic, he is a brilliant player that uses combinations that only the most advanced players would dare to try. The best part is Josh is just an everyday kid with a good heart. He has never been schooled in the techniques of the advanced rules of competition that accompany the game. Josh lacks the ""killer instinct"", and he finds himself up against kids whose lives are warped by their obsession for the game.
Ben Kingsley plays the chess teacher hired by his dad to coach him in the ways of this competitive world where many of the moves are based on games played by such greats as Bobby Fischer. Laurence Fishburn's role introduces the flip side of the spectrum, a street player who plays for money in Washington Square, and shoots from the hip. Conflict is bound to ensue when oil meets water and it certainly does.
Director Steven Zallian, interlaces live footage of Bobby Fischer's genius which Josh narrates, adding an interesting aspect to the possibilities and incredible vigor behind the competition that these kids are up against. Based on a true story, this was a great movie for the whole family, with life lessons to be learned. I highly recommend it.  Kelsana 6/19/02",1024444800,2,1319,4.836283185840708

565567,5,6303114946,"For a lot people, watching chess is no more interesting than watching paint dry: boring.  Don't let the fact that this is a chess movie put you off into making the same mistake about this movie: it is not a boring movie.  In fact, it's one of the better movies of the nineties, sadly underrated.
It is mostly based on a book by the father of the chess prodigy Joshua Waitzkin, which tells the true story of this boy's rise from obscurity to success in the chess world as a junior.  The timing, of course, is crucial: the movie was released in 1993, the year after the brilliant former world champion from the US Bobby Fischer came out of hiding after 20 years.  In 1992 Fischer defied an embargo on Serbia by successfully defeated his old Russian nemesis Boris Spassky in a rematch of the famous cold war world championship, and then again vanishing.  The Fischer-Spassky match was undoubtedly a catalyst for the making of the movie, with the media attention on Fischer's amazing victory and his eccentric disappearance making the time ripe for a chess movie to be palatable for the chess-ignorant masses.
But actually ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" is not about Bobby Fischer, nor is it first of all about chess.  Bobby Fischer's genius from childhood is the background for a study of the chess-playing genius of seven year old Joshua Waitzkin.  But in truth, the movie focuses more on the relationship between a boy and his father, who moves from the extremes of doubt about his son's talents, then pride and ambition, and finally a desire to develop these talents without hindering a normal childhood.  After hiring a professional chess teacher to tutor Joshua, his father comes to realize the danger of professional chess dominating his son's life.  What the movie portrays about parents of chess-playing children is a stark reality in most sports: it is the parents who are fanatic about their children's sports, and will do everything to make them succeed, placing their children under enormous pressure.  Joshua's father has to learn to rediscover a normal relationship with his son, and to relieve his son of the psychological pressure he has been under.  If only more of today's parents would learn the same lesson.
But despite the touching father-son scenes, the conclusion is still a predictable feel-good ending: a win at a high level tournament.  But that doesn't take away from the other aspects of the movie.  In the end, it's an intelligent movie that the whole family can enjoy without a knowledge of chess, but undoubtedly chess buffs will enjoy it the most.  The New York park scenes where druggies and other street people are playing two-minute blitz chess will especially be memorable and satisfying for chess aficionados.  But ultimately this isn't just a movie for chess nuts, it's a movie for everyone.  Aside from just a couple of rare incidents of profanity, it's clean, wholesome and enjoyable.  Which is a lot more than can be said for most movies nowadays.",1015372800,3,2984,4.854043392504931
565568,5,6303114946,"This film is loosely based on the real story of chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin, who has outranked other junior players by so many points, that he is the first American player since Bobby Fischer who genuinely deserves to be hailed as the ""Next Fischer.""
Unlike Fischer, however, Waitzkin is a regular kid (or was, he's in his early 20's now), who loves baseball, fishing, other games, like Clue and Monopoly. He also likes playing blitz chess in Washington Square Park with the men, some of them homeless, yet still gifted chess players, who charge tourists for games to make a living, and play one another to prove their prowess.
(The Washington Square Park players are real, by the way. Washington Square Park is in Manhattan a few blocks above Greenwich Village. It's a well kept park. Street performers often ply their trade there as well, and you can take your pick of street vended food.)
Bobby Fischer single-mindedly pursued chess. He was the son of a single mother, who quite literally spent every moment he could muster working on chess problems. When he could find no one to challenge him, he played himself, and as Max Pomeranc in the film, playing Josh, says ""He always won."" Armchair shrinks diagnose Fischer with Antisocial Personality Disorder, Sub-clinical Schizophrenia, Asperger's Syndrome, and a host of other neurological disorders; one of them may be right, but as far as I know, Fischer has never submitted to a D&E.
There is nothing wrong with Josh Waitzkin. He loves chess, but not to the exclusion of other pursuits. He loves chess enough to spend most of his time at it, just not all. He loves chess as long as it remains fun. He loves the rush of the daring and audacious blitz chess of the Park. He likes winning trophies at first, but soon the pressure builds, and tournaments become less and less fun, especially after he realizes that the other kids in the tournaments perceive him as the boss at the end of the final level.
When one of the greatest chess strategists in the country becomes his teacher, he declares that the Park will corrupt Josh. Exposing him to the rough underbelly of chess will teach him all the wrong things; he must stick to proper chess; walk don't run. Chess loses its headiness, and for Josh, its fun.
Chess in the Waitzkin family had become a means to a winning end. But Josh's parents have not stood idly by. Unlike Bobby Fischer's overworked and overtired mother, unwilling, or unable to struggle with her single-minded son, the Waitzkins realize the adults must make a choice. How much time for chess, and how much for baseball? For other academic subjects? For friends who aren't playing chess with him?
It is a grand dilemma. A choice of paths, when the road diverges, and no crystal ball. We know what single-mindedness meant for Bobby Fischer: he drew national attention when he represented his country, winning several international titles. Then he embarrassed his country with complaints and insults about other nations' food, plumbing, and lack of bowling alleys. But he may be neurologically deficient. Josh has no deficits. Did chess make Fischer that way, or was his single-minded devotion a result of an existing impairment?
""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" is Fred Waitzkin's way of saying he is searching for his son the balance that Fischer never achieved. It is wondering which is more satisfying, fame or fitting in. It means wondering whether reclusive Bobby Fischer ever felt satisfaction. It is wondering whether having a talent obliges you to use it.
The chess games here are splendidly filmed. Although Max Pomeranc is no Josh Waitzkin, he is a ranked chess player. The chess games are choreographed, but because the children really are accomplished players, they understand the moves, and reproduce them convincing. Their facial expressions and other obvious interest in the games sustain the lengthy and very suspenseful game scenes.
Sterling performances from all cast members: Ben Kingsley as Bruce Pandolfini is a marvel of restraint. (The real Pandolfini has a cameo, as does Joel Benjamin, and some other champions.) Joe Mantegna as Fred Waitzkin didn't come across as the man who wrote the book Searching for Bobby Fischer, but he fit into the world of the film. After a couple of viewings, I exorcised the narrative voice of the book from my mind, and Mantegna was very much the father of Max Pomeranc's Josh, about whom I can't say enough, so I won't even get started, and just leave it at that.
This is a simple movie: no CGI dinosaurs, hovercraft, guns, bullets, or cars exceeding the speed limit; also, no pan shots of countrysides, big houses, boats, people drinking casually out of glasses with stems, and having all kinds of Deep, Scary Secrets.
Don't just see it once. I recommend seeing it at least twice (thrice is better).",1007942400,26,4820,4.8721071863581

I was hooked to the film immaditely.. and then I saw a scene, where Josh plays a game of chess. Suddenly I felt something inside.. I remembered the times I played chess with my dad. I kept watching and I experienced the beauty of chess through this movie. The vast tournament halls where dozens of kids were playing chess, and then dark chess-club atmosphere, where old men were playing chess so seriously. After the movie I was so exited that I went to search my old chess-set from basement. Now I am a active chess player and I have an eternal burning chess-fire in me.

Joe Mantegna discovers his seven year-old son, Josh played by Max Pomeranc, has a gift for playing chess.  He sees his son's talent, and the enter the world of chess tournaments, behind the guidance of tutor, Ben Kingsley.  Before long, he becomes the number one child chess player, and is seemingly unstoppable.  Conversely, Josh merely wants to be a ""normal"" boy and just wants to have the love and admiration of his family instead of countless trophies, so he soon loses his edge for the chess world.
The cast is astonishing.  Lawrence Fishburn, one of the most underated actors of our time, plays a wonderful ""street smarts"" chess player.  Add in cameos by Dan Hedaya, David Paymer, and William H. Macy, who I can't watch on the silver screen without saying ""Ah, Gees,"" and you have one entertaining film.
This is a truly wonderful movies, with lots of depth.  It is not so much about chess as it is about finding one's inner strength and character in the face of adversity and high-pressure challanges.

565652,5,6303114946,"I'd like to contradict reviews on IMDb by annmason1 and ""spleen.""

The movie is NOT about the ""genius in us all"" (Josh has a unique talent that any parent trying to teach their kid chess knows), and it is NOT a movie about chess.

It's a movie about Josh, and his incredible talent and his father trying to come to grips with that fact. It's not a move that everyone will identify with in terms of their own children. But they will identify with it's theme.

Personally, I find the characters played by Ben Kinglsey and Lawrence Fishburn to be almost ancillary to the movie. Even though they may have been real cahracters in Josh's life, his talent existed whether they did or not.

I loved the movie because I identified with Josh in other areas, and probably almost all of us will in one way or another.

We concluded that the  father/son story is really one of the more insignificant (still important,  just not /as/ important) themes of the movie.
Combine that with superb  acting from Kingsly, Fishburn, Mantegna, and the young Max Pomeranc, and  this movie should be required viewing for everyone of any age.

I am an evangelical Christian, and  although nothing overtly Christian or Biblical appears in this film (nor is  any credit given to God for Josh's talents nor his naturally generous  spirit), it nevertheless portrays the most Christ-like demeanor in a  ""regular"" person I have ever seen on film.
