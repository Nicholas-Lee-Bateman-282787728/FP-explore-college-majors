8735128,1,B015YPSD9K,"Almost impossibly tedious wannabe art-house horror film about a woman who crawls out of the water deep in the woods and goes on a killing spree throughout the film, mesmerizing her victims and them ripping open their throats with her nails.  Does she drink their blood?  Probably, but the film isn't entirely clear on that point.  Queen of Blood has no dialogue and no plot and wants to get by on imagery and music alone.

This reminded me more than a little of that strange Scarlett Johannsen film Under the Skin--but it isn't nearly as good--and I didn't particularly like Under the Skin.  It doesn't help that Queen of Blood is ugly to look at--the movie has the too crisp and shiny sheen of low budget digital video which robs the film of any atmosphere.  It also doesn't help that the imagery in Queen of Blood is rarely interesting or imaginative, despite the fact that the movie wants to get by on its images.  Queen of Blood is also shot almost entirely in slow motion, which doesn't make what we are watching more interesting or creepy.

Another problem with Queen of Blood, as if it didn't already have more than enough, is that lead actress Shauna Henry isn't particularly interesting looking and doesn't have an even mildly expressive face--not a good thing since she's onscreen for about 90% of the film and has to act entirely without dialogue.  But to say that she gives anything resembling an acting performance would be a great exaggeration--she just wanders blankly through the film showing nothing--no emotion, no hunger, no desire, no wonder at the world around her--giving the audience little reason to care about what happens to her or her many victims.

Some people will no doubt enjoy Queen of Blood simply because it's different--if only that were the same thing as good.  This one is a pretentious, repetitive bore with no entertainment value and little that would even qualify it as being a horror movie besides the occasional gore.  If a movie with no plot, no dialogue, no suspense and no characters sounds good to you then Queen of Blood is your film.  If you actually want to be scared or entertained then look elsewhere.

The Blu-ray includes the film Blood for Irina, which is shot in the same style as Queen of Blood and features the same lead actress.  This one is more of an overt vampire film and isn't quite as dull and repetitive but the lack of dialogue (there is a bit of voice-over narration representing the vampire's thoughts) with no compensation in terms of style or interesting imagery ultimately makes this one a bore as well.  Director Chris Alexander doesn't have nearly enough talent or imagination to pull off what he is trying to do and would be better off shooting a more conventional film where characters actually talk.  It's little wonder that a no name company ended up putting this out--Queen of Blood and Blood for Irena feel like the cinematic equivalent of the terrible self-published novel that every legitimate company would reject.  In the future, I'll know to stay away from films released by InterVision.",1489363200,,3071,4.773156899810964
8735129,1,B015YPSD9K,"What can be said about this double feature? Well, first of all I picked it up because it was a couple dollars on Amazon and the artwork looked cool. I now wish I had my couple dollars back. First off, let me say it takes a lot for me to turn off a film, because well, I can sit through some crap. This was beyond boring. I watched ""Blood of Irina"" first and I got to 3/4 through ""Queen of Blood"" and just couldn't take anymore. Chris Alexander should really just get a job shooting nature stock storage, because that is basically what these movies are. There is no dialogue, which is fine, cuz I love silent films. So, if you are thinking about picking this up, I'd suggest downloading the movie poster and calling it a day.",1488326400,,724,4.253623188405797

In this sequel to Chris Alexanders acclaimed Blood for Irina (2011), we first see Irina clawing her way out of a stagnant woodland lake, immersed in mud and mire, a trail of red following a path in her wake. As she revives in a scene that reminds me a little of Virginia Christines similar resurrection in The Mummys Curse (1944), she is saved and looked after by a man who lives in a cabin, before he is brutally killed  indicating that Irina has lost none of her killing nature.

There are elements of Jean Rollins The Living Dead Girl to some of the more gruesome scenes. As an aside, if it weren't for the reviews for the previous film, comparing it to the work of Rollin, I may never have been inspired to become acquainted with the French directors work, so for that I will be ever grateful to Chris Alexander.

The performers are wonderful. Skinny Puppy founder Nivek Ogre has a seemingly great time as The Preacher (especially a bloodily protracted death scene!) and is great in the role. Interestingly, he is dressed in black (which provides a terrific, imposing look), whilst his apparent nemesis (although this is never quite established) floats around in white.

Shauna Henry is bewitching as Irina, truly a mix of the sultry and deadly, enticing and dangerous. She goes through a tough time on this shoot and is rarely seen not streaked with blood and dirt, wading through water and bramble. And throughout, she retains this magnetic, silent, vampiric aura. Which brings the question  is Irina actually a vampire? In the first few scenes we see her gazing at a mirror image and walking out into bright sunshine.

The soundtrack is suitably barren and sparse, ascending to triumphant choral tones when Irina mangles Carrie Gammels pregnant Widow to death.

The scenes of Irina wandering around a ruined backyard, blood streaked and carrying the sleeping (?) baby are ethereal and strange, because her glowing presence is so out of place. This conjures up moments from the previous film, whose atmospheric heights aren't quite matched here: decay surrounded Irina and was very much central to her story (indeed her rebirth seems to be just that: she seems free of the relentless sickness that gripped her  and framed the story  in the previous film). The misty, dewy, leaf-strewn autumnal wilderness isn't quite as an evocative world in which to place her  but equally, there would be little joy in attempting to replicate what had gone before. Also, and quite rightly, the lush and verdant surroundings create entirely a spirit of their own. It quickly becomes a world on her terms, and assumes an ethereal, heightened reality.

I would love Irinas story to continue in further films of this nature; I would love there to be a huge volume of work about her. She is fascinating. Her journey is fascinating, and these films are captivating and so deserving of any horror fans time.",1451779200,2,2905,4.822937625754527
8735135,4,B015YPSD9K,"This is the MONDO DIGITAL REVIEW. With thanks to Mondo Digital.

Bearing no connection to the '60s Curtis Harrington sci-fi/horror hybrid of the same title, this bloody, dialogue-devoid art film is the second feature for Chris Alexander, the former Fangoria editor in chief, who designed this as a sort of sequel in spirit to his 2012 vampire film, Blood for Irina. Though it's only noted in a tiny box on the back of the packaging, the Intervision release of this film on Blu-ray (with a separate DVD edition as well) actually contains both titles, making this an unofficial double feature most viewers will probably watch in reverse order.

First seen crawling out of a lake in a soggy white dress stained with blood, the wordless Irina (Henry) spends her opening minutes of Queen of Blood skulking around the pastoral outskirts of a town and laying waste to anyone who crosses her path. If she looks more than a bit like the title character from Jean Rollin's The Living Dead Girl, that's hardly accidental since she even recreates her predecessor's murderous method of plunging her sharp fingers into her victims' flesh to draw out their blood. Title cards split the action into ""Birth,"" ""Death,"" and ""Rebirth"" as she tangles with locals including a not-terribly-stable preacher (Skinny Puppy's Ogre) and a pregnant widow (Gemmell) whose impending delivery figures in the film's Inside-inspired climax. Queen of BloodQueen of Blood

The heavy Rollin influence tones down slightly in the earlier Blood for Irina, whose title tips it off immediately as an homage to Jess Franco's Female Vampire. Here our different incarnation of Irina is a more vulnerable bloodsucker whose body functions are falling apart, causing her to expel the blood she consumes to survive. Her human handler (producer Goodfellow, who also appears in a smaller role in the second film) runs the seaside motel she's turned into her lair, and in a desolate haze, she wanders the neighborhood contemplating her impending oblivion. Into her world steps Pink (Gemmell), a young prostitute who will play a pivotal role in Irina's fate.

That's about it for the plot, and since both films play out virtually silent apart from sound effects and effective, wall-to-wall scores composed by Alexander himself, casual horror fans will probably be left scratching their heads a few minutes into either of them. Both films are basically showcases for Henry, who makes for a solid nonverbal presence whether playing a decaying wreck or a savage predator, and there's no question that Alexander put all of himself into this films with additional duties including shooting and editing. The Rollin/Franco nods Queen of Bloodare plentiful and sometimes fun to spot, though oddly enough, the eroticism that fuels both of their films is entirely absent; this is all Thanatos, zero Eros. The slow, dreamy pace is offset by some nice use of color and texture at times, though it's undercut by the decision to shoot both Queen of Bloodwith what looks like differently calibrated consumer grade HD cameras. What comes off as poetic and dreamlike on 35mm film has a habit of turning clunky with 30fps video, and you'll have to fight the urge to mail everyone a light meter when some scenes looking imbalanced and overly harsh. That said, if you can get past the technical limitations there's some pleasure to be found here if you look at these as love letters to a type of cinema that's almost entirely extinct on mainstream movie screens.

The limitations of the productions (which were presumably shot for pocket change) mean the Blu-ray presentation ranges from crisp and impressive to chunky and pixellated depending on the scene, with Blood for Irina looking weaker due to some odd lighting conditions in a handful of night scenes. Both titles feature LPCM audio tracks that do a fine job of supporting Alexander's score, and since there's barely any dialogue (just some voice over in Blood), there's no real need for subtitles or other audio options. Aside from the two films, extras include three minutes of juicy ""Gore Gaffes,"" five minutes of behind-the-scenes footage with ""Directing Ogre"" (including some unexpected twerking comedy), a 36-second Ogre intro (recorded in a very noisy location), two alternate endings (one a slight extension, the other a much more explicit tie-in to Irina), the single-shot trailer, an Alexander commentary, and a 23-minute cast and crew Q&A (Alexander, Henry, and Gemmell) from the Toronto premiere with the Blood in the Snow Canadian Film Festival. The latter two extras overlap a bit as Alexander cites some of his primary influences (including Malick, Herzog, and Lynch) and goes more into detail about how he planned this as a body count western, with several production anecdotes included about the Ontario shoot.",1447286400,5,4812,5.093789607097592
