4712443,5,B005J9ZFRA,Bleach Uncut Box Set 11; A continuation in the series and a wonderful addition to my sons Bleach video library.  I just wish they would release the seasons a little more timely,1325635200,2,176,4.5
4712444,4,B005J9ZFRA,For a filler it is pretty good... but in box set 12 there are 3 episodes that are part of the Aizen Arc (what I read on Bleach wiki and if I understand what I'm reading right :) ...) so in a way you HAVE to buy it... kinda burns your money... I wish that Viz would go back to having box sets that had 20 or more episodes!,1325203200,,321,3.6666666666666665
4712445,4,B005J9ZFRA,"To start off I will admit that this season is not as good as the main Aizen/Espada Arc. However, this is only because the main story line of Bleach is so epic. This season revolves around a princess from the soul society that Ichigo has to protect from evil ninjas. At the same time the 3rd Squad's captain is replaced by a strange new Soul Reaper. I won't delve into the story to much but it really isn't bad. There is a lot of action and I personally enjoyed the head Ninja. It isn't the best season of Bleach but I liked it better than the Bount Arc. It is worth taking the time to watch and it should hold you over until they get back to the main arc, which will hopefully come out on dvd in June.",1324771200,8,701,4.0503597122302155
4712446,1,B005J9ZFRA,"First off, this is a filler arc that isn't worth buying seeing how it does not even slightly contribute tot he over all story like the Bount arc. Also, this set is not in widescreen. These episodes originally aired in 16:9 in japan and were cut down to 4:3 for Adult Swim. When the box said uncut and orignal, they must be referring to the Adult Swim tv releases and not the actual orignal episodes.

In addition to all that, there's nothing special to the box, not even a cardboard sleeve.",1323993600,15,490,4.384615384615385
4712447,3,B005J9ZFRA,"FILLER A DIFFERENT STORY SKIPPING THE MAIN STORY DOES NOT CONTINUE WITH THE FIGHTING, THEY SHOULD OF KEEP GOING WITH THE MAIN ONE THEN STARTED THIS OTHER ONE. I think the next boxset the last episodes or boxset 13 they will continue. The filler is ok but come on. I do agree thay should be giving more episodes and still cost $30",1323734400,3,329,4.32258064516129
4712448,5,B005J9ZFRA,"Firstly I hope this release is as awesome as all the others.
And secondly I hope that Viz releases this with the same high picture quality I always get from them.
hope everyone buys this it holds many a great episode....",1316822400,4,220,4.390243902439025

4712504,5,B005J9ZFRA,Beginning of the new captain arc and to clarify its the second filler arc in bleach in my opinion this arc is better than the bount arc that dragged out a little too long. Recommended for bleach fans who want to experience the series fully but can be skipped by those who only want to follow the espada/aizen arc which is vastly superior.,1433548800,,338,4.380952380952381

4712524,5,B005J9ZFRA,I love Bleach,1411603200,,13,3.6666666666666665
4712525,4,B005J9ZFRA,"even though these twelve episodes are a complete 180 turn from the main story line, they're very interesting. Ichigo and friends get put on guard duty for a noble girl, who is a target for assassins. in the mean time squad three gets a new captain, that the squad questions at first but grow to respect him. the new third officer is involved in some strange events.",1405382400,,365,4.462686567164179
4712526,4,B005J9ZFRA,"What I find annoying: Box set 10 ends with Ichigo standing on a broken tower with Orihime holding hands, telling her let's go everyone's waiting. So how did everyone get together, Chad and Rukia were injured and could barely move. How did they leave without the spell and power to do so? Why did the battle suddenly stop with so many enemies just standing around? Suddenly Box set 11 puts us back in school everyone healed and happy and no explanation on how that came about. A princess is introduced and fighting begins again. I know Bleach is a slice and dice fighting  story line, but I actually like the comedy and a story line where they are not slicing each other up constantly. These vids are cut and edited things are blurred out or changed, so we are not getting the original version, which is greatly annoying. The price for not getting the whole arc any arc actually (only 3 disks), is now way up and that is a royal pain.
What I like: Attractive/interesting characters you want to see prevail and when they are not constantly slicing and dicing,  interesting story lines. Although saving females from bad guys has been 3 (different females) arcs now is getting tiring. Love Bleach ?(I do) get the set, be prepared to pay too much, if you're into slicing and dicing only what the hell is wrong with you?",1403136000,,1314,4.540084388185654
4712527,3,B005J9ZFRA,Love this series but this was so odd.  The story line went to a side story all of a sudden rather annoyed at the sudden stop and change of story line.  I mean really it changed without finishing the last story line.  Apparently the story with get back to it later.  Ok that just stupid.,1400544000,,286,4.1454545454545455
4712538,5,B005J9ZFRA,Received the set in a timely matter.  Very excited to add it to my growing Bleach box set collection.  On to the next one.,1399593600,,122,4.041666666666667
4712539,5,B005J9ZFRA,Bleach is a really good show I been watching it for about 7 years now and still enjoy to watch it,1396828800,,97,3.6666666666666665
4712540,5,B005J9ZFRA,This part of the series is a filler. A filler means that they have made a new story in the middle of the original story. It is still a good story to watch.,1396310400,,155,3.727272727272727
4712541,5,B005J9ZFRA,"If you are a bleach fan, then I don't have to tell you about this product.  If you have not seen the Bleach Series, do yourself a favor and start with Box set #1, the 1st 20 episodes of the series.  I love this anime series, but unless you start at the beginning, it will be hard to follow what is going on.  Outside of that, it is a good quality product and it is wonderful to have Bleach on DVD to watch when I want.",1389225600,2,418,3.8372093023255816
4712542,4,B005J9ZFRA,"It's Bleach, at this point in the series you either know if you like it or not.  Just a shame the the box sets got less disks, but didn't get any cheaper.",1386979200,,154,3.8125
4712543,5,B005J9ZFRA,its came in good condition with no problem it is an excellent anime and it was amazing to watch and see,1379289600,,103,3.9523809523809526
4712544,4,B005J9ZFRA,Pretty good side story to tell as a filler episode set. Very interesting new captain of third squad. Can't hold his liquor though :),1378598400,,132,4.541666666666667
4712545,5,B005J9ZFRA,Was exactly what I was looking for and can now watch the series and enjoy fully as it should be,1377043200,,95,3.8
4712546,5,B005J9ZFRA,"I gave this a five star ratting because it was sold at a pretty good price, it was shipped and it arrived to me on time, and it was brand new- like amazon said it would be.",1369785600,,172,3.675675675675676
4712547,5,B005J9ZFRA,"Well there is not much I can say about this anime that u can't just go read about on ur own but I'll do my beast. ^_^'
Ok boy can see ghosts, some ghosts eat other ghosts so there r other ghosts that stop the bad ghosts from eating the good ones, boy meets girl good ghost that gives him the power to become like her so that he can fight the bad ghosts.
I know that the bad ghosts r call something and r a little different than just ghosts and that the ones I'm calling good ghosts r called something else also.
I'm just trying to make it simple here ok. ^_^
I really do love this anime just don't want to go into great detail on what is what when someone just wants to know the basics of what they maybe buying even though if ur looking for a anime u most likely already know what ur looking for or buying if ur here.
If I'm wrong about anything I've said then I'm sorry. -_-,",1364947200,,877,3.932584269662921
4712558,5,B005J9ZFRA,i liked it i got it for my collection and it met every expectation i had and it was an all out grate perches,1357948800,,108,3.5416666666666665
4712559,4,B005J9ZFRA,The DvD was transported without incident. It proved playable on our current DvD player and was very entertaining to view,1357171200,,120,5.05
4712560,5,B005J9ZFRA,Love Bleach no matter what! Some of the fillers are annoying but this was one of the better episodes. Tired of getting ripped off though on the disk sets.,1353110400,,154,4.344827586206897
4712561,4,B005J9ZFRA,"Again Bleach belches and out comes some more filler right in the middle of the good stuff. This time it's not too bad. I would definitely prefer it if they would stop this bad habit of wasting time. Even though they do this all time, the filler in this box set is relatively entertaining. A princess from the soul society is being forced out of her home by her Regent. He is using her clans weapon mastery to stage a takeover. He needs to kill princess Rurichiyo in order to do this. Ichigo and Rukia are determined to put and end to this revolt.

I can see some people not liking this bit. It does come right in the middle of something very important, but we all know Bleach does this crap to us pretty often. I've just accepted it and try to enjoy it for what it is. This story arc by itself is better than a lot of entire anime series out there today. Give it a chance. You may enjoy it. The next volume of Bleach is pretty good and it begins at the end of this one.",1351468800,,969,4.0732984293193715
4712562,5,B005J9ZFRA,"Anyone who's says stuff like 'this is only a filler' does not understand how Bleach works.  Kubo has created a story that at times meanders sure but all the parts do equal the whole and Bleach is far richer because of it!
I'm up to Box Set 10 after a spell on 'Crunchy Roll' but I will be buying all the back titles now that they have caught up a bit.  Go Bleach ^_^  You know even if the whole thing was a meaningless piece of trivia (which it's not) it would still be worth the price for the simply beautiful imagery!",1342051200,,519,4.068627450980392
4712563,5,B005J9ZFRA,"Happy with the purchase, another dvd in the Bleach series, this was purchased for my children along with another two boxsets",1333497600,,124,4.9523809523809526
4712564,1,B005J9ZFRA,"To start off, I want to say that this anime is really great.  I love Beach, its full of action and drama.  But Viz media for some reason started getting cheaper and cheaper with their box sets.  Boxes 1-5 all came with a nice case and came with small posters randomly. Boxes 6-12 are just a single crappy looking dvd case that I could have bought at walmart.  They don't even come with nearly as many episodes as the the first box set.  There is 11 in box set six compared to the 20 in the first set.  So that is one more than half for the same price.  At this just find a place online to download the episodes and print out the cover.  Don't waste you money.  Viz has forgotten that it collectors that take the time to buy the dvds to support the industry.  If they can't take the time put a little effort into their case, then why should you care about buying the official box set.",1332720000,,883,4.111111111111111
4712565,5,B005J9ZFRA,"I notice alot of people are hating on this arc and it seems to be based on it being a filler and how it pretty much interupts the Hueco Mundo arc, but in all honesty this arc is really good. I fully acknowledge that it's not as good as the canon material, but I find it to be the best of the filler arcs for two reasons. The first is Rurichiyo and co. are actually pretty good characters, alot better than what you usually get in a filler, in that they're likable and their story is decent. The second, and my main reason for liking this arc, is its focus on Kira; whoever wrote that particular part of the story did a very good job in presenting his plight of both dealing with his captain's betrayal and affirming a place in his squad, especially with a new captain taking charge. This arc does a good job in developing his character and I also think it helps in supporting the moments of character growth he shows in the canon material. I find this better than the Bount arc since it has better characters and the current Zanpakutou arc on CN because this one isn't as slow in comparison. I will admit that I have a couple problems with how this arc ends, but that's for the next set.",1330041600,6,1187,4.233480176211454
4712566,4,B005J9ZFRA,"When i first bought this set i was expecting to see what happens after the battle of Ichigo and Grimmjow but oddly enough the episode started with a different story line. Its about a rich girl Rurichiyo that comes in the world of the living with her two bodyguards and are being chased by a group of assassins. Now Ichigo and Rukia have to protect this girl.
The first 2 discs are just plain talk and the background of Rurichiyo but Bleach shines on episode 175 and disc 4 where Uryu, Chad, Ichigo and Rukia are challenged by the group of assassins that are after the noble girl. Fights are pretty good with lots of action.
So if you are a true fan of Bleach you won't miss this set. It's not on the same level as the Arrancar Arc but it's still BLEACH!",1328054400,2,753,4.236111111111111
4712567,2,B005J9ZFRA,I really hated it when they started taking away the 'box' from the box sets. They used to come with 5-6 disks now its 3 for the same amount of money! It's stupid! Not only that but what's supposed to be season 11 is actually season 8. Season 11 is supposed to be episodes 206-212. Which is so short they should put it with another season. I really hate spending $30 for 3 disks instead of the usual 5-6. At this rate I wouldn't be surprised if more people started watching it online. I'm really thinking about it.,1326240000,3,513,4.244897959183674
8475578,3,B005J9ZFRA,"This entire set is part of a filler arc. You can totally skip this one unless you're a completist and need to watch the entire anime series.

Truly this is one of the better filler arcs. The new characters are decent and interesting. The real problem is that timeline wise, this fits exactly nowhere. And it interrupts the Arrancar arc.

If you read it as a stand-alone set as a flashback it doesn't suck, but it doesn't line up with the manga anywhere.

I got it to watch with my son who was reading Bleach and even he wasn't interested in watching it because it didn't match the manga.",1529107200,,587,4.36697247706422

8475585,5,B005J9ZFRA,"One of my favorite arcs within Bleach, if your a fan of the series the arrancar Arc may just be one of your favorites as well if you haven't seen it yet and well worth to have it on DVD to play every so often.",1487894400,,209,3.6666666666666665
