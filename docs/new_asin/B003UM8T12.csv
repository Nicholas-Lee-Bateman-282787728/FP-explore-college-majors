4204923,5,B003UM8T12,"We've always respected Harold Rowe Holbrook as an actor---witness Hal's 10 Emmy wins and one Oscar nod---but if there was ever even the teeniest quibble about just how good he is, we have three words: That Evening Sun. And please don't confuse this Imagine Entertainment release with Evening Shade, the TV '90s seires in which Hal co-starred with Burt Reynolds and Marilu Henner.
The film, just out on DVD and Blu-ray, tells a simple and strong story.
  A man-strong, resolute-will not let his life disappear into the twilight. He will not let it vanish over the horizon. Instead, he will fight . . .to keep the things he loves, to confront the petty emotional robberies inflicted on the elderly. That Evening Sun is a tale of determination and hope played against the humid background of Southern gothic emotions. It got rave reviews---Variety hailed Hal's performance as a ""career-highlight star turn as an irascible octogenarian farmer who will not go gentle into that good night.""
  And on a touching, bittersweet postscript, the film marks the last screen appearance of Dixie Carter, Holbrook's real life wife, who died shortly after the film was made . . . and to whom the film is dedicated.
  Holbrook plays Abner Meecham, an aging Tennessee farmer living in a nursing facility where he has been placed by his son, Paul, who has no sympathy for a father's pride. But Abner has other ideas . . . and escapes to fulfill his dream of returning to his cherished farm and living out his final days in peace.
  But when he arrives, he finds that his son has betrayed him a second time.
  Paul has sold the lease of the farm to Abner's old adversary, Lonzo Choat. With the battle lines drawn, neither man is willing to give way. Threats are made, events spiral out of control and a startling climax is inevitable.
  Based on I Hate To See That Evening Sun Go Down, a celebrated anthology of short stories from William Gay, and fraught with passion and courage played out against life's departing light, That Evening Sun is a portrait of a man who is not only intent on reclaiming his land, but his own life as well.

4204924,4,B003UM8T12,"This stirring indie drama evoked a range of feelings in this viewer & I suspect that it will in others who like indie dramas.  On 1 level it's character-driven with exceptional performances from Holbrook and the rest of the main characters.

On another level it's a story of loneliness & sadness, bordering on despair.  This level is shared by every main character in the movie & is very impactful.  On still a 3rd level it's a story of lost love -- of Meecham's life-long spouse and of his own past living on the property that he struggles to take back from his loathsome tenant, played superbly by Ray McKinnon.

Now some will say that this movie ""drags"" in parts, and I agree with one important qualification.  It seems to me that some of the slower scenes help the more subtle subthemes to emerge & take effect on the viewer.

I hope we'll see a lot more of Scott Teems' work.  As the director & co-writer, his work in this film shows great promise.  You can find out quite a bit about him & his efforts by watching the excellent Special Features on this Blu-Ray disk.

Very worthwhile, in my opinion.",1283990400,2,1105,4.48
4204925,5,B003UM8T12,"THAT EVENING SUN is one of those marvelous ""little"" pictures that usually gets lost in the shuffle because it's too little.  On the other hand, if one is lucky enough to catch it, the film stays with them forever.

Hal Holbrook, in what is perhaps the finest performance of his stellar career, plays Abner Meecham, a crusty old coot who escapes from his retirement home and returns to his farm, only to discover that his adult son (Walton Goggins) has ""sold"" it to a family that the octogenarian considers to be `white trash"".

Meecham, however, is a proud, stubborn man, so he moves into the sharecropper's cabin across from the main house, buys a barking dog for company and lays ""siege"" to the intruders.  It is just a matter of time before events turn very ugly.

Adapted to the screen by director Scott Teems from a short story by William Gay, THAT EVENING SUN is filled with well-defined characters of varying shades of gray.  Meecham may, indeed, be the hero of the piece, but he is definitely a flawed hero, just as his antagonist (Ray McKinnon), for very brief moments, can evoke our sympathy.

The ending to the story is now what one would expect.

Mia Wasikowska, Carrie Preston, Barry Corbin and Holbrook's late wife, Dixie Carter, are effective in their various roles.

4204926,5,B003UM8T12,"I was very fortunate to watch ""That Evening Sun"" on the big screen in Los Angeles.  It's cinematography and locations are visually stunning and apropos for the story.  Of course, Mr. Holbrook is magnificent and perfectly cast for the lead role.

What makes this film excellent IMHO is its modest, understated approach.  Sure, it's a drama, but at no point does it get ""dramatic"" or overtly poignant.  Rather than force feed his viewers with evocative music and gratuitous camera moves/angles, director Scott Teems trusts that viewers are able to sense emotional subtlety and subtext.

4204953,4,B003UM8T12,"The story of a grumpy old man who ""just wants his farm back"".

When we first see Abner he's rotting apart in a nursing home with a lost and lonely look on his face that seems to scream ""I've been throw violently across the threshold of boredom and dementia"" - but right then he remembers that he's still alive and owns some property that is about 20 miles away from the elderly coop he's been barricaded in for years.

He arrives on his farm to find some local hillbilly that he knows and has always hated named ""Lonzo Choat"" living on his property with his family. This doesn't sit well with the old man. It quickly escalates into a bitter property dispute which reaches some semi-epic proportions.
  This old geezer even takes to sitting on the tenant house porch across from the main house with his new dog and making the dog bark constantly because he knows it will drive Choat crazy.

It's funny when you look at the cover of this movie with Hal Holbrook standing with his cane and a cute dog with the sun radiating beautifully in the background - makes you think that you're in for yet another sweet love story or something like that. But really what you're in for,in essence,is people being ungracious,nasty,and predictably human. ""This is my land"" Abner tells Choat ""and I'm not going down without a fight"" - yeah,land that you don't need and don't have any use for anymore. What did this old man think he was going to do ?? Wake up every morning at 6 am and eat a breakfast of 1 egg and a slice of toast and he'd have a booming successful farm again ???

Throughout the battle of wills the only one that's really kind to Abner is Pamela(Mia Wasikowska), Lonzo's daughter. She comes by a few times just to talk to Abner and while Abner isn't really nasty to her it's also clear that he could care less and he just wants what's his and to win the battle. It was fun listening to Mia Wasikowska delivering her lines in a mock-redneck tone of voice kind of like she did in the movie ""Lawless"".

This movie was better than I thought and I don't want to give too much away,but if you like movies about embittered 80 year old men and people being beaten with garden hoses give this one a try.",1465344000,4,2194,4.362745098039215

4205000,2,B003UM8T12,"Sorry folks, the character development in this film just wasn't there.  The base storyline about a older senior who leaves a nursing home to return to his farm and wants the people living there out.  Hal Holbrook's character is not a sympathetic one.  He comes across as arrogant, mean and nasty.  His son tells him that he was mean to his dead wife and mean to him.  He, himself, tells how the day his wife died he had given her five minutes to get dressed to go to town and when she was not ready he drove off and left her.  She died while he was gone.  The only good thing he does is stick up for the wife and daughter when the drunken husband is beating the daughter with a hose.  He did not like the Choat family so in his mind they are low class white trash that don't deserve to live in his house.  The other characters are only superficially touched upon and much of the antagonistic problems aren't helped by Meechum's constant insulting remarks to them.  He is not a nice guy.  His approach to life is the same one that Hollywood throws into almost every film about a senior - I'm old I can say what I want.  Sorry, I think that is wrong.  I am a senior and I think that is garbage.  If it wasn't nice to say when you were young, it isn't nice to say now.  You are not handing out life lessons or knowledge with that type of attitude.  No one can or wants to learn from that type of individual.  Sorry, I'll get off my soapbox.  The film is ambiguous at the end and you are not sure what happened.  It isn't that it is left open, it is more that the director and writer did not know how to end it.  Too many unanswered questions.

4205032,4,B003UM8T12,"Based on the short story ""I Hate to See That Evening Sun Go Down"" by William Gay, ""That Evening Sun"" presents us with an epic battle of wills between two equally immutable forces fighting over the same piece of land.  The property in question is a rundown farm in rural Tennessee owned by Abner Meecham (Hal Holbrooke), an octogenarian who's just walked away from the retirement home his son (Walter Goggins) placed him in after a serious fall a few months back.  When Abner gets back to his farm, he is stunned to find that - thanks to a deal brokered by his lawyer son - the place has been signed over to a white-trash, ne'er-do-well by the name of Lonzo Choat (Ray McKinnon), who now lives there with his wife (Carrie Preston) and sixteen-year-old daughter (Mia Wasikowska), with whom Abner establishes an uneasy but generally tender relationship.

Scott Teem's screenplay is multi-faceted and complex in the way it develops its characters.  For instance, many of the very same qualities that make Abner so appealing to the audience - his tenacity, his commitment to principle, his uncompromising willingness to call things as he sees them - are also what make him a hard person to deal with for those who are actually a part of his life.  This is especially the case with his son, who though he obviously loves his father and wants to do right by him, harbors a lifelong resentment against the old man for his harsh treatment of both himself and his now-deceased mother while he was growing up.

To a somewhat lesser extent, Lonzo is also portrayed in a three-dimensional light.  Though he is an alcoholic, a wastrel, and a man prone to acts of violence against both animals and members of his own family, there is a sense that he is genuinely trying to get his life together by earning an honest living and finally being a decent provider for his loved ones.

The movie really seems to understand the tragedy of old age - of feeling as if everything you ever called your own is now being taken away from you and nobody around you seems to care.  In fact, many of those people - despite, in some cases, their possible good intentions - are proactively involved in bringing that outcome about.  The movie also touches upon that root and highly American value of property ownership, and the willingness to stop at virtually nothing to ensure one's hold on one's land.

""That Evening Sun"" is what is called in the trade an ""actors' picture,"" and, indeed, it is the performances that are of primary interest here.  Holbrooke has always been a tremendous actor, but here he is positively transcendent as Abner, a crusty old coot who is so much more than just a crusty old coot.  Goggins, the brilliant star of ""The Shield"" and ""Justified"" and a co-producer of this film, is also excellent as Paul Meecham, a role quite different from the ones in the aforementioned works.  And McKinnon, Preston (""True Blood""), and Wasikowska (""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""The Kids are All Right"") are all wonderful as well.

The tone of the film is contemplative and muted, and Teems' direction is rich in atmosphere and setting.",1311811200,,3107,4.696132596685083

Well, Mr Holbrooks character wasn't taking that.
He give a fierce performance of a elder man who is going
to fight for what he believes is right...

Holbrook's character takes a taxi back to his farm and finds that his son has leased the farm to a beer-swigging redneck and his family with the 90 day option to buy, but Abner Meecham is not going to let it happen. You talk about ""forgotten elderly folk"" and you fail to see, this is one 85-year old who basically told his lawyer son to shove it -- he's willing to go down fighting to hold onto ""the only thing left that's important to him."" Meecham's plight literalizes the dispossession of advancing age, the very ones you speak of. Meecham says, ""The road ahead ain't long and it ain't winding. It's short and straight as a goddamned poisoned arrow. But it's all I got, and I deserve to do with it as I please.""  Also, this soundtrack is aching for a CD release, Patterson Hood's Southern voice lends so much to this film in all it's humble subtlety.

1) The son and wife were apparently treaded bad by the old man ""Ryan Reynolds"" all during his marriage and raising his son.
2) The son was loveingly justified puting the old man in a ""healthcare center"" because of serious injuries after a fall which was the second time he almost died. So that should have been fair
3) Nobody but the neighbor and ""trashy girl"" are likeable and they have minor parts
4) The ""evil"" renter could not throw him off the ranch since he was only renting and apparently since he had no job would never be able to own the farm.
5) The old man was so cantankerous to everyone, including his his son & wife, but did briefly feel bad he would not wait for her to stop trying on a dress to go out AND SHE DIED when he returned.
6) The son tried to convince the old man that in 2 or 3 weeks he could have his nemesis removed and move back onto the farm.
7) Why the old man never told the law or his son that the renter killed his dog and hung him on the porch would have removed the threat to ""put him away"" for being crazy, so the story teller let his son that the law think he was nuts
8) The girl offered to not run away and help him fix up the shack and he turned that down and would not even leave with her.
9) The old man ""apparently-since the ending is totally unfinished"" set up an apparent attempted murder charge sending the unlikeable unemployed renter to jail. Even thought he saved the old man when he suffered a stroke while setting up the burned up cabin hoax.
10) This was a great short story made into a great movie but with all the loose ends and non-ending it hurt this 5 star movie to be a 3 or 4 star for me. And to my mind, the old man was more evil than the struggling down trodden failure of a man renter.  He might have matured if the Old man had left him alone.

(1.) Not much of a farm - all we see is a house, an adjoining shack and basic run-of-the-mill rundown barn. Oh, and a few trees with some grass between them. There is a scene of walking on a dusty road with a few rolling grassy hills and a few more trees with a concrete culvert with a little water flowing through it. How exciting. At least it was cheap to film and people who live in the city are probably going WOW a tree.
(2.) Storyline is totally unbelievable:
(a.)  An elderly man with some obscure loss of his wife where she is shown with not helpful flashbacks and he looks fifty years older than her.
(b.) A son who is a successful lawyer that hates Dad for a not explained reason and wants to sell the farm and put Dad away. Son rents farm to Dad's most hated person.
(c.) Dad literally walks out of nursing home - sure. Nursing home pays some beat up cab $20 to drag him back as if they've never heard of moral, health and legal issues. Cab driver gets bribed for $5 to head in the opposite direction; into the country to drop him off in some remote location. Please!
(d.) Dad shows up at his old farm to find his most hated person as the new renter.
(e.) Dad decides to occupy shack and torment hated renter and most hated renter, with legal lease, doesn't even have the sheriff evict him.
(f.) Dad gets barking dog and gun to torment hated renter. Hated renter still doesn't have Dad evicted from squatting on farm he no longer owns.
(g.) Dad's dog gets hung dead and Dad has him stuffed and placed on porch to torment renter. Renter still doesn't evict Dad.
(h.) Dad burns down shack and hated renter rescues him.

At the beginning, everything was from Meecham's point of view and he was not disclosing all truths. The movie appeared to be the classic story line of family sending an unwitting parent to a nursing home. But all was not as initially perceived: Meecham was withholding past treatment of family and his health.

And then we get the son's point of view; trying to act in his father's best interests, given his father's health and the son's limitations with time pursuing his profession plus his son's paying the bills and his father's past treatment of him.

And, we eventually find Choat has a good side. Everybody in the film shows the positive and negative aspects of their character, albeit to greater/lesser extents. Isn't that the way life generally is?",1286064000,4,921,4.935483870967742

8406033,3,B003UM8T12,"Adapting William Gay (whose short story this movie is based on/named after) for the screen is tempting, but hard to get right.

Gay's Provinces of Night is one of my all-time fave books, but the screen adaptation, BLOODWORTH, was an anachronistic and mark-missing mess.

Thankfully, That Evening Sun gets closer to the mark. I read the short story the movie draws from, but for some reason have a lack of memory about it (while remembering other stories in the same collection). This was actually good, as I could experience the movie afresh.

Hal Holbrook does a good job as a consistently in-character, bitter old man, straight out of the Silent Generation, who rebels against being placed in an old folks home. He goes back to his homestead in the rural South, and finds that his lawyer son (the always-enjoyable Walt Goggins) has rented it to a family whose head of household is the unsavory Lonzo Choat.

Choat actually kinda steals the show as the complex villain. Holbrook is great throughout, but Choat provides the slowburn menace. And he's not a cardboard bad guy, he's just out of calibration, old-fashioned (like Holbrook's character), lazy, and out of sorts with the world. He's done some bad things in the past and does some bad things in the narrative, but no one is so far gone that they are past the point of redemption, and this is what the movie does/shows well, for all characters involved, resulting ultimately in a very humane story.

Whether it's Gay's writing or attempts at adaptation I don't know, but please read William Gay's source materials. Adaptations are noble and well-meaning, but they just come across as somewhat anemic and lacking, despite the best efforts of those involved. The only movie I've seen that holds up to the force-of-nature-nature of contemporary Southern writers' writing is the excellent BIG BAD LOVE, about Larry Brown. That's a film that does its source material justice and transcends its own being as an adaptation.

That said, THAT EVENING SUN is worthwhile. It may move a bit slow for some viewers, and is a relatively simple story w/ a one-location setting and small cast of characters whose lives inter-connect. It tries to capture the nuance, texture, and dark chain of events in Gay's stories via music, cinematography, acting, and setting, and at times it succeeds. For WG adapatations, stick to it over Bloodworth.",1526947200,,2380,4.9375

Sadly, there was little in any of the characters to cheer for, including Holbrook's. Yes, you feel for him as he wrestles with the changes he faces but his crotchety (and calculated) temperament only added to the Hatfields and McCoys tension throughout the film.
Despite the fine acting all around, there was no resolution to any of the storylines. I did have a glimmer of hope when Holbrook is saved from the fire but nothing came of that.
