530422,5,6302993695,I don't remember seeing the Christmas episode as a child but it's great! Pretty hilarious. So why did queen Marlene never before incorporate anything at all about Christmas in He-man and She-ra's childhoods? So we could have this episode of course!,1475020800,,248,5.073170731707317

530424,3,6302993695,"The only thing I remembered as a kid was Skeletor acting good in the snow. It was very touching when he had sympathy for the dog Relay.

Unfortunate this special is worse than an average episode of the regular series, as too much time is wasted on The Monstroids (a cheesy Transformers clone) and The Manchines. Miguel and Alicia had too much screen time as well.

Masters of the Universe fans appreciate the cameos of the more rare characters in the background.",1472515200,,462,4.621951219512195

530616,2,6302993695,"If you collect classic cartoons, and you have collected all the other He-Man episodes, then you'll have to add this one to your list.
BUT, this thing is horrible.
Best way to describe the experience of watching this movie is,
  It's like eating a piece of 3 week old wedding cake.
At first you notice that it's sweet; overwhelmingly sugary!  It's not that easy getting through it and it isn't easy to digest.  At the end, when you feel sick to your stomach, your greatest wish will be to go back in time and stop yourself from consuming it.
IN THAT, it creates a unique definition that you will use in the future to describe a similar experience that can only be truly understood by someone who has put themselves through this torture.  Doctors could use this as a stand alone definition!
Example:  ""This made me feel like I watched the He-Man & She-Ra Christmas Special.""
I didn't ""Hate"" it because (for a cartoon collector) I believe it is a necessary evil, like a flu shot.",1429401600,,976,4.517045454545454

I remember viewing both cartoon series from the 1980s, & it was more thrilling whenever characters from He-Man's show crossed over with She-Ra (i.e. He-Man, Skeletor, etc.), & this Christmas special is no exception: the forces, both good & bad, from Eternia & Etheria in one amazing adventure as they see to the welfare of two children from Earth (one side to protect them, the other to be rid of them) & learn that the Yuletide season reaches beyond even Earth's borders to other worlds.

530655,3,6302993695,"I used the PRIME instant video service for the first time this holiday season when I noticed I could download the app to run it through my PS4. What I really wanted was to watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, but Amazon's geed wanted me to pay for that a second time even though I already shelled out for PRIME. Same went for Jingle All the Way, Scrooged, Home Alone etc etc etc. The He Man Special was just where I ended up when I got tired of all the disappointment. It was an alright consolation for the harsh reality that Amazon Prime instant video IS NOT WORTH IT AT ALL FOR THE MOVIE SELECTION. Far from my first choice, I ended up here when it turned out that even though I pay $100 a year for PRIME, I still have to pay additional money to watch Christmas movies that were released decades ago.

Simply put, 99% of household recognizable Christmas titles were only available to rent for $3-$6 in spite of having paid for the year of PRIME service. I mean, I can understand not having movies that just hit shelves up there for free, but some of these movies are older than me and I am still being charged twice to watch them just because Amazon is aware that they can slap you in the face and charge you twice for these holiday movies at this time of the year.

Nothing like Amazon's greed to fill your stockings with a little warm holiday cheer. If i could get PRIME shipping for less without the worthless instant video 'service', I would do it in a heartbeat. As it stands, Amazon Instant Video isn't even a perk in my eyes, it is something that I am forced to pay extra for just to get to the PRIME shipping savings. First and last time I waste any time on the instant video service.",1419638400,,1702,4.299065420560748

530756,5,6302993695,"I didn't remember seeing this movie as a kid but, I'm sure I would of loved it then as I do now.

I like how this story really gives an all star cast to play in this collection of the He-Man and She-Ra series.

Although, the title of the movie is He-Man & She-Ra A Christmas Special; it seems as though Orko is the main character in this saga.

Skeletor and Hordak team up like they have in the past against the do gooders, however as per usual, their partnership is always faulty.

All and all, I must say that this is a must have for the Filmation fans of the past. Also, something that can be added to any Christmas collection to put on for the kids. In my opinion it's right up there with Miracle on 34th Street and other timeless classics.

Only thing I would change would be to have made the movie longer.",1418169600,,811,4.140127388535032

When She-Ra returns from her planet with the water crystle Man-at-Arms transporter beam delivers the sky spy back to Eternia, and all the other people in the palace learn of the Holiday traditions. Towards the middle and ending of the film, it's funny when Skeletor get's this good feeling and lends a hand to Miguel and Alicia while traveling the snowy mountains on Etheria. Even though he was assigned to deliver the two earth children to Horde Prime,everyone gets to see how the spirit of Christmas even lights the hearts of some tyrannical beings, not all evil beings. I liked how the film ended when the two children return home to earth. As long as I'm drawing breath, I will still celebrate the Christmas season with this DVD.

530928,3,6302993695,"First of all, I grew up in this era and Masters of the Universe toys were among my favorites all time. But let's just be honest: These cartoons were godawful (in concept if not in screenplay) and this one is only slightly better than average.

However, that's part of what makes it good. (I'd actually rate it closer to four stars than two.)

He-Man and She-Ra do what they usually do--punch solid things, fling around swords, indiscriminately change between alter-egos, say a lot of stupid things like ""I think the odds are uneven."" Only because little Orko accidentally ends up on Earth and comes back with two children in tow, the backdrop of this episode is Christmas.

It amazes me how much the cartoon's producers neutered characters that, when the toys were created, were supposed to be fearsome and ruthless, like Skeletor. At some point in show history, they decided to make him Dick Dastardly with a sword. In this episode he's reduced to having a weird space puppy lick his face (ummm...yeeeech) and saying that feeling Christmasy makes him ill. Everybody laughs at him and then they go celebrate Christmas.

It's absurd, ridculous...and hilariously self-aware. I loved it, honestly.

For those who grew up in the early '80s and remember it with some level of fondness, you'll likely get a kick out of this. Basically anybody else probably will find it to be stomach-churning.",1356393600,,1387,4.885106382978724

530970,5,6302993695,"Now THIS is how you make a DVD of a fan-favorite show!  In addition to the rarely-seen special itself (more on that in a minute), you get a wealth of great extra material.  I, for one, enjoy learning all the behind-the-scenes info about shows, especially animated ones.  There's over an hour of documentary material here, focusing on the holiday special itself, and the universe of He-Man in general.  There's a pair of great-looking art cards (apparently there are 16 available in all; I got a terric watercolor painting of She-Ra, and one featuring characters from both series), the rarely-seen music video ""I Have the Power,"" plus a brief making-of segment on the video, a well-designed ""character profiles"" feature, trivia, and the complete script.  The packaging itself is full of colorful artwork, an added bonus for fans.

As for the show itself, it holds up fairly well (SPOILERS AHEAD).  Unlike many cartoon holiday episodes, however, Christmas is really only a small part of the story.  Orko's bumbling accidentally brings two Earth children to Eternia, where they share the news of Christmas with the denizens of She-Ra's world (and since this IS a kids' fantasy show, the legend of Santa take precedence over the Christian holiday, which gets only a throwaway line about Bethlehem).  It's all innocent fun, although He-Man fans may cringe at how easily Skeletor is swayed by the Christmas spirit.

If you're a fan of He-Man and/or She-Ra, there's no question you should have this in your collection.  And if you just like animated holiday fun, give it a try.  As a fan of both shows, I couldn't be happier with this first-class package.",1309737600,2,1648,4.952727272727273

The premise of the movie is that no one on Eternia knows anything about Christmas (somewhat strange as He-Man's mom is from Earth.)

I really like the use of Mermista and Peekablue in the Christmas special, Peekablue almost seem to have a temple or something of her own, but whatever happened to that later in the She-Ra series? There are always a few things that you could wish for, like how does Horde Prime look like, why didn't we get to see The Rebellion beat The Horde etc. That will remain wishfull thinking, even so I'm more then pleased to complete my He-Man & She-Ra collection with this fantastic gold coin of an item!!!",1271203200,,835,4.5364238410596025

I grew up with He-Man, and having a Christmas special which brought together all (most anyway) of the characters from the classic He-Man/She-Ra line up was a dream come true.

It is fun to see many of the characters from both He-Man and She-Ra, all though not all are present if you are looking for some from the original He-Man series.  It is entertaining enough and has in-depth documentaries for those die-hard He-Man and She-Ra fans. It is interesting to see the He-Man/She-Ra take on the Transformers craze of the time with the Monstrines (sp?) and Manchines.  Overall I would say it is worth the price of admission, especially for kids and fans of the He-Man series.",1230076800,2,678,4.633333333333334
531010,4,6302993695,"Throughout the years cartoons have provided the source material for some very touching themes. The 1980s (and earlier) were a less politically correct time for society and as such allowed for Christmas to be celebrated by our beloved characters. While perhaps the most famous of these specials is the Charlie Brown's Christmas, He-Man & She-Ra teamed up back in 1985 to offer up 45 minutes of sheer holiday joy.

The plot involves the ever-mischievous Orko stowing onboard Man-At-Arms' spy satellite and accidentally launching it out into space. For reasons never quite explained, he winds up crash landing on the distant planet earth just prior to Christmas. Upon arriving he meets two young children in the process of cutting down a pine for use as their Christmas tree. When beamed back to Eternia, the children follow Orko and end up bringing the holiday spirit along with them in the process.

The hilarity really ensues when Skeletor begins to catch a bit of the Christmas spirit himself. This episode coincides with the era at Filmation where Hordak became the true villain of both shows and Skeletor basically became a really cool looking comedian. Somehow or other, the formula simply works. And unlike the Charlie Brown special mentioned above, the He-Man She-Ra Christmas Special actually has less to do with the holidays themselves and more to do with a kidnaping escapade whereby Hordak and Skeletor start to compete with each other to earn the respect of Horde Prime. Also as mentioned before, the run time for the feature is roughly 45 minutes (approximately that of 2 standard episodes back to back). Don't mistake this for an excuse to overlook this gem as it truly represents an intregal piece to anyone's BCI/ Masters of the Universe collection.

As always the case with BCI, the attention to detail in the packaging is second to none. While only a single disc, the package comes with a beautiful slip cover containing a beautifully decorated tri-fold inner sleeve. The book is again full-color and is loaded with cool facts and history and once again BCI slips 2 collector's art cards into the package: This time by comic artists Phil Jimenez and David Mack. If all this isn't enough to warrant picking up this gem, the special features included on this disc surely will be.

Once again BCI simply raises the bar on what is thought possible in terms of shedding the behind-the-scenes light on the whole creative process in assembling the He-Man/ She-Ra legacy. This time we are treated to 2 brand new documentary features (how BCI tracked down all of the individuals involved is truly worthy of a documentary itself). The first, The Holidays and Morals of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe is an excellent series of interviews with the show's writers, artists, and producers regarding the themes and lessons packed into each program and how the tradition started. The second piece (my favorite of the two) is entitled The Heroes and Villains of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. This time we hear from the same motley crew in the first feature only now they get into their favorite heroes and villains and what made them tick. Combined the two features actually trump the run-time of the feature presentation (about 70 minutes). Very interesting stuff!

Finally fans are treated to the usual bag of treats that BCI has earned a reputation for including on their collections: A previously unreleased music video ""I have the power"", a montage of moral-tags at the closing of each show, character profiles, trivia and fun facts, and the complete Christmas Special script on DVD-Rom. Another beautiful little collection from a company who leaves no stone unturned when it comes to the He-Man Universe.",1209945600,,3728,4.9584

I loved the characters, the stories, the morals, etc., and such a cartoon portrayed a lot of characters that seemed realistic with every day issues. I remember, everyday after school, I used to leave in such a hurry because I did not want to miss She-Ra (sometimes I used to leave my little sister behind because she would not hurry up).

I still have recorded on VHS about 1 entire episode of She-Ra and part of another one.  She-Ra was a very cool hero for us girls and as for the guys it was He-man, which I think was so nice, since several episodes were cross overs.  Everytime I think of She-Ra it brings back a lot of my elementary school memories of my friends and teachers. My biggest disappointment was when from one day to another She-Ra was off the air.

531033,5,6302993695,"This DVD release was eagerly anticipated by myself and many other children of the 1980's who grew up watching She-Ra---and remain astounded there are no series releases yet.  It is also a heart-warming holiday special for children of the 1980's.

Orko brings back two earth children, Alisha and Manuel, after Man-at-Arms's satellite testing had accidentally beamed him down to Earth and then back again. In inter-planet exchange (and holiday tie-in) the Earthling children proceed to share Christmas customs with their new friends.

 The children realize that Adam, Adora, and their friends from both Eternia and Etheria are good people. Because these twins very rarely get to see each other despite a shared mission to protect and defend entire planets, Adora and Adam's holiday celebration is very special indeed.

The holiday spirit of the children is so strong that the Horde Prime decided Hordak and Skeletor's combined efforts are required to defeat the Christmas spirit.

However, the best part of this story is seeing Skeletor have a BIG change of heart (ala The Grinch) and then work to save the children from Hordak and the Horde Prime---his one-time collaborators, who apparently remain just as miserable and evil as ever. Who knew Skeletor was such a softie underneath it all? Oddly though, the holiday sentiment does not permanently transfer because Skeletor would continue to battle He-Man in other seasons as if nothing has ever happened to him.

I hope that this marks the beginning of complete She-Ra seasons themselves being released onto DVD. It's absurd that long-time fans such as me have to endure such great lengths in order to see a childhood heroine once again in action.

The only thing that really bugs me about this release is not having any extras of any kind. Something like this practically begs for the extras which only the DVD format can host!",1133827200,,1877,5.051779935275081
531034,5,6302993695,"I haven't yet seen the DVD version but I remember that as a child, this was one of my most frequently rented movies.  She-Ra was definitely one of my favorite shows and I had most, if not all, of the action figures.  I'm so glad something of She-Ra has finally been released on DVD and I give it 5 stars just for that.  I'm sure I will love it.

By the way, She-Ra and He-Man would not make a cute couple because they are twin brother and sister.

Since writing the above, I have watched the DVD several times.  The quality of the picture was good, I found no fault with it.  As for the bonus material, I thought there could have been more about She-Ra.  There is a list of She-Ra and He-Man characters and their descriptions, which I found to be incomplete.
Despite those factors I'd still give the DVD 5 stars.  Hopefully we'll be seeing more of She-Ra in the near future.",1133568000,2,874,4.248484848484848
531035,5,6302993695,"Produced at the very end of the two-series multi-season Fantasy-Sci-Fi Romp that is He-Man & She-Ra, this holiday season-themed TV special brings together both the Masters of The Universe, and the Princesses of Power for one last world and dimension spanning adventure.

Until now this gem has been a relative rarity in the MOTU/POP library, and many fans that are fond of either series may not even recall it's existence, if this is the case for you, I would strongly reccomend buying this title immedietly.

Featuring the best part of the cast from both shows, heroes AND villians, as well as a few new faces, this movie is packed with action, adventure, humor, and a heart-warming moral message.  If you're a fan of Filmation, you know that this is all delievered in a high-quality fashion, and without ever pandering.  This Christmas Special is the ultimate culmination of all that was wonderful about both shows, it's an ultimate must-own!",1133136000,2,944,4.955696202531645

531057,5,6302993695,"Okay, even though her series hasn't hit DVDs yet, but at least we can be happy something of She-ra is actually coming to DVD. Ive never seen this christmas special, though I believe I will love it.

I used to watch the old series of She-Ra with my grandmother every saterday morning, wit my Pops and bootie pajamas. Ever since the VHS tapes of the series and this christmas special has disappeared from rental shelves, its been nearly impossible to find anything of the twin brother and sister together in one DVD.

The Honor of Grey skull is returning!",1128124800,5,553,4.575757575757576
531058,5,6302993695,"I am so glad that ""He-Man and She-Ra: A Christmas Special"" will be released on DVD in time for the holidays! I still have my old VHS copy of the show that I recorded from television back in the 80s, and I still watch it every year.

Characters from the ""He-Man"" and ""She-Ra"" cartoons come together in this special holiday episode. Adora has returned to Eternia to celebrate Christmas with her parents and her twin brother, Adam. She's also brought a bunch of friends from Etheria with her to join in the fun. The holiday celebrations turn sour when Orko is playing in one of Man-at-Arms' new defensive devices, a Sky Spy. Poor Orko inadvertently launches the ship, and he ends up taking a trip into space and landing on a mysterious planet called Earth. Orko meets two children, Alishia and Miguel, who are lost in the woods. They join Orko in the Sky Spy to get out of the cold just as Man-at-Arms figures out how to bring the ship back to Eternia...with Orko and the kids in tow.

Of course, Christmas with He-Man and She-Ra wouldn't be complete without everyone's favorite villains. Skeletor and Hordak are commissioned by their boss, Horde Prime, to kidnap the children and deliver them to him...Horde Prime believes that they are the source of the ""disgusting Christmas spirit"" that is polluting his universe, and he is determined to get rid of them! Skeletor and Hordak compete against each other to see who can kidnap the children first. Alishia and Miguel end up spending a good portion of time with Skeletor, and in my opinion, that's the best part of the show. We get to witness the evil Skeletor become attached to these two kids and their Manchine puppy, Relay. It's hilarious!

In the end, Skeletor becomes filled with the Christmas spirit, and he saves the children from what would have been certain doom at the hands of Horde Prime. The kids get to enjoy Christmas and are eventually returned to their Earthen parents safe and sound.

Overall, this Christmas special is one of my favorite parts of the ""He-Man"" and ""She-Ra"" series. All of our favorite characters are together in one place, which is a lot of fun. There are also plenty of new characters, including the Manchines, who are a bunch of little robotic people and animals. Even though we get to see a lot of He-Man and She-Ra in this episode, Skeletor is the real star of the show...I crack up every time I see him get all sentimental on the screen!

I'm thrilled that this DVD is finally being released. Now that the ""He-Man"" series has slowly started to trickle out on DVD, hopefully ""She-Ra"" won't be far behind!",1127606400,85,2590,4.633986928104576

"" I am a He-man fan, and I am an Artist and Writer, my art can range from reality all the way down to disney style, Take it from me, this movie has very good animation and art style-the story is still kinda Christmas [less costly] but anyone who sees this movie will like it I give it

7833442,4,6302993695,"I remember when He Man and She-Ra: A Christmas Special first appeared. After more than three decades, there is a clear nostalgia factor as I look at a completely absurd but fun story. Earth children explain Christmas to the usual MOTU characters and there are some memorable moments. She-Ra fans will probably enjoy this more than He Maniacs and there are some annoying moments (the Manchines? Really?) that simply don't hold up well. All that being said, this is a fun trip back down memory lane despite the absurdity. As he so often did during the cartoon, Skeletor is constantly entertaining and--no offense to He Man--is the star of the show here. The first scenes, with a host of heroes gathered from two worlds, also stand out. Recommended.",1512691200,,746,4.8359375
