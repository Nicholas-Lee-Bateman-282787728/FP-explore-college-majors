4563005,3,B00546PRM6,"The Fairly OddParents: Wishology is a part of, and should have been included in season 6. It's a great 3 part episode so i didn't mind spending the extra money but without any real reason to not include it with season 6 makes these companies (Nick/Amazon) seem very greedy. If your selling episodes separately, add something - a poster, a minifigure, game codes, a extra DVD with special features or a soundtrack, ANYTHING.",1430352000,,423,4.808219178082192

4563008,5,B00546PRM6,"I LOVED this movie when they aired the three parts of it on Nick and I was on the edge of my seat after Part 2 ends on a epic cliffhanger! It features Timmy Turner and all of the friends / enemies he's made through the entire series banding together to face a true villain among FOP characters, the Darkness and the Eliminators. The other movie jokes are hilarious and it brilliantly lives up to the FOP standards of comedy. The only sad part was the ending of Part 3 where everyone's memories were erased.

When I watched this, I thought Nick was going all out for a Fairly Odd Parents ""series finale"" since so many things happened that blew my mind!",1347753600,,651,4.336065573770492
4563009,5,B00546PRM6,"I don't even own it yet, I'm ordering it now.  I've been after it for a LONG time though.  I saw it on TV a while back and I laughed my ass off.  It makes fun of all the great trilogy movies; Matrix, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings.  It's a children's cartoon, but so many of the jokes are specifically geared towards adults.  I think I want it for myself more than for my son.",1318464000,,374,3.8684210526315788

8456399,5,B00546PRM6,"I'm Soooo glad wishology has its own DVD!!! I remember watching this movie live on TV when it first came out and it's awesome, I've never met a FOP fan who doesn't like this movie! I've read some reviews of people saying they were disappointed that this wasn't included in the complete season 6 set but due to how long this movie is I can understand why it wasn't included. It's probably easier to just release it separately then add an extra disc in the season 6 set for it.",1486944000,,475,4.288888888888889

8456401,5,B00546PRM6,i like that they put the movie out like this it is a three part one so it is worth the price i paid for it. it is great to just pull the movie out it self when you want to watch it rather then pull the whole season and go thru the episodes to find the movie when i just want to watch it alone at the time and i like the art work for the movie i like seeing it when i pull the movie out i was waiting for them to put the movie out for so long it is great to own it again i love this movie along with the other ones of fairly oddparents this is one of the best ones they have done i think every one should buy it.,1462492800,,611,3.4671532846715327
8456402,5,B00546PRM6,"This is one of the most enjoyable specials, in my opinion, that the Fairly OddParents has ever done.  It essentially shows Timmy Turner at his best; as a hero.  Yes, it presents some of his flaws, (overconfidence, a little vanity), but (spoiler ahead)..........,Don't read if you don't want the spoiler........, at the end of the second part when he sacrifices himself to save not only his family and friends, but his ENEMIES as well, is very reminiscent of the Timmy Turner of the first 4 seasons.  The plot, of course, involves an entity called the Darkness, which threatened Fairy World in ancient times, and has returned and now threatens both Earth and Fairy World, and by implication the entire universe...or is The Darkness the actual threat. Timmy is the ""Chosen One"", that is the one who must battle the Darkness and save the Universe.  Being the Fairly OddParents , there is plenty of humor, particularly Mark Chang who has some very funny lines in the second part.  The only problem I had with it is the reset button that erased everyone's memory, except of course for Cosmo, Wanda, and Timmy himself.  After Timmy's battles and his courage to reset everyone is an insult to Timmy, and Jorgen at the end basically insults him.  Other than that, though, it is a very exciting and enjoyable adventure.  The quality of the DVD's themselves are very good.  Unfortunately, even though the special was in high definition, the discs are not.  In all, a DVD worth owning.",1455062400,,1474,4.790513833992095
