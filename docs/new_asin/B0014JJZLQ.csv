8255928,4,B0014JJZLQ,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this Drama. I loved Bae Doona in ""Someday"" so I gave this one a try.  Wow, her characters are like night and day.  In ""Someday"" she is very quiet but in this show she is a ball of energy! I really admire her acting range.  I think if anyone else played this character it would be annoying but she was able to deliver a touching performance.  The drama is older so it is a bit dated although not has much as some from the same year. The story was not too original but it was engaging.  I don't plan on rewatching it right away but it was an enjoyable 17 hours!",1354752000,3,602,3.9833333333333334
