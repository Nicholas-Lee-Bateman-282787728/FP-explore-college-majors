8611876,5,B00F3BKJTS,"This show is fantastic, it makes me laugh so much, I love it, if you like Sex and the City and Broad City, you'll love it.  But  Amazon, what gives?  ***Episode 6, ""The Wedding,"" is completely missing***, and it looks like you've been aware of the issue for at least 6 months.  Add it.",1528675200,,285,4.222222222222222
8611877,5,B00F3BKJTS,Brilliantly written and hiarious.  I hope to see much more of Knappett and company in the future.,1525305600,,97,4.705882352941177
8611878,5,B00F3BKJTS,"Obscene, crude, pointless, sad, hilarious! This is a mindless over the top comedy about three 30 something women who continually get into trouble. It is not meant to be taken seriously, but the writing, acting, and storylines are brilliant. Jessica Knappett reminds me very much of a female version of Tommy Saxondale (played by Steve Coogan). By the end of the series I was rooting for her to find happiness. Bravo to Drifters for 4 seasons of laughter!! Highly recommended!!",1517875200,2,476,4.9625
8611879,5,B00F3BKJTS,SUPER funny and amazing cast.  All of the girls are incredible at depicting their abstrsct characters and  indestructible views on what females all experience today,1515542400,,164,5.52
8611880,4,B00F3BKJTS,No Season 3 Episode 6 available to stream. The show is awesome. But Amazon where is this episode????,1514851200,2,100,4.611111111111111
8611881,5,B00F3BKJTS,"Finally, a show about idiots, and 3 women in the lead roles! Jessica Knappett is a freaking GENIUS!!! Bill & Ted, Silicone Valley, That 70's Show, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld, The Wayans Brothers, Martin, Bernie Mac--if anything in the list appeals to you at all, you will love this show! It may be a little uncomfortable for some at first, because we are conditioned to accept and expect women in such roles to be lampooned, for it to be no more than a cheap, misogynistic burlesque.

This hilarious show is no joke. Well, not at women's expense, anyway. Don't let anyone convince you that simply because a show was created, written, and directed by a woman that it was not at women's expense--including hers. ""Feminist"" porn comes to mind. (I say this as a psychologist.)

You have GOT to see this wonderful hot mess!!! Like the goddesses in Absolutely Fabulous, these losers remind me of myself and my friends.",1513296000,3,916,4.754716981132075
8611882,5,B00F3BKJTS,Absolutely hysterical. One of my favourite Britcoms.,1512172800,2,52,6.571428571428571
8611883,2,B00F3BKJTS,"These women haven't seen their 20's in 20 years, ridiculous miscasting.",1511568000,,71,5.545454545454546
8611884,5,B00F3BKJTS,Absolutely Hilarious I wish they would have kept the show going.,1508716800,3,64,4.909090909090909
