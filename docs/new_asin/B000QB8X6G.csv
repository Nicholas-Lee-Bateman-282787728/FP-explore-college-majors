8195312,3,B000QB8X6G,I thought this drama was pretty good. The English subtitles were good and have been very good on anything bought from this seller. I love Super Junior and I thought it was awesome that Heechul played in this :) He played the elder brother and did it well. The storyline stayed strong throughout the drama,1443916800,,304,4.545454545454546
8195313,5,B000QB8X6G,"This is the first Korean drama I've purchased (from Amazon, used, good condition). SBS got the episodes taken down on the internet. This was so very good I HAD to see what happened next.  The Guru, award-winning actor Kim Myung Min, demonstrates why he holds that title. And Nam Sang-Mi reminded me of Kim Sun-ah. Enjoy!",1331510400,,320,4.714285714285714
