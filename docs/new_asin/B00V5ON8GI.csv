8709365,5,B00V5ON8GI,"The remake 'SILENT NIGHT ' made an R rating....yeah right!! A little girl was shocked with a cattle prod until she foamed out of the mouth before getting ran through with a freaking fire place poker. Then a young woman practically nude is put down the shoot of a wood chipper alive and fully concisely screaming in excruciating pain....all the way down into the spinning blades! Cool flick, but was no way in hell reviewed by any rating board.",1501372800,2,443,4.620253164556962
