5552334,5,B00B1RB83Y,"After watching more than 80 films at Cinequest, it's hard to remember everything I took in. One great exception was ""Dose of Reality,"" a thoroughly engaging film that grabs you from the opening scene and never lets up. Featuring top-notch production values and a rock-solid cast, Dose truly stood out at this year's festival. It was no surprise, therefore, that it was brought back for an encore screening on the festival's final day. If it hadn't, there would've been a lot of unhappy festival-goers as I spent several days hyping the film once I'd caught up with it. Without risking the major sin of a spoiler alert, all I will say is that I would put this film's ending right up there with ""The Sixth Sense,"" and that alone should be reason enough to run out and grab ""A Dose of Reality"" as soon as you can.

I can't wait to see what's next from this talented group of filmmakers.",1363651200,6,883,4.51875
5552335,5,B00B1RB83Y,"Saw this film at Cinequest 23 in San Jose. Didn't know what to expect going in to watch the film. I was engaged the whole film and it literally blew my mind. The credits rolled and I just sat in total silence, in shock. I can't say much more than that. Weeks later, and I'm still thinking about this film!",1363478400,6,305,4.1
5552336,5,B00B1RB83Y,"It's refreshing to see something different and unique -- Dose Of Reality certainly delivers on this. An amazing film that grabs you right from the start and never lets go until the shocking ending. I saw it in early March, at a packed theater at the Cinequest film festival in San Jose, CA, for its World Premiere and the festival audiences were talking about it for days! Definitely a film to debate about. The acting in this film is exceptional; Fairuza Balk, Rick Ravanello and Ryan Merriman all seasoned professionals who give emotionally intense performances. -- The Q/A with the filmmakers was an added bonus at the festival. Glad to see Dose Of Reality will be out on DVD now -- I highly recommend it!",1363478400,2,708,4.672
5552337,2,B00B1RB83Y,Great idea but script was horrible unfortunately.  Requires a complete and utter makeover on the script.  So much of it was corny and could use shots of more realistic dialogue with hints of dialogue that is suspicious or canned in a way that throws the audience off.  So boring had to skip through it often knowing that there had to be something more to it...hence the piece that was missing from the script. It would be worth a remake.  Acting was good; as good as the script could allow.,1512950400,,490,4.47191011235955

5552340,5,B00B1RB83Y,WOW! A movie that captures you right from the start & keeps you interested to see where it's going...taking you to a bang of a dark twisted ending that I never saw coming! I love it!!!,1492300800,,184,4.138888888888889
5552341,5,B00B1RB83Y,"This movie is like being on a high speed roller coaster from start to finish. From the acting, to the story, to the directing, this movie is fantastic. The actors in this are film are incredible, especially Rick Ravanello and Fairuza Balk. Their scenes are intense. The ending may leave you drained",1462838400,,298,4.75

5552343,5,B00B1RB83Y,"This is one of the most ORIGINAL, suspenseful, and entertaining movies I have EVER seen! The actors were phenomenal and the ending was VERY surprising, like jaw-droppingly so!!!! Let me just state also that Fairuza Balk is a sensational actress and I don't know why she doesn't star in more movies. Ever since The Craft I have adored her but sadly haven't seen her in Mich so it was stupendous to see her in all her maniacal glory!!!! Check this one out guys! So VERY VERY wort it!",1457481600,2,481,4.4772727272727275

5552345,4,B00B1RB83Y,"Fairuza Balk shines in this novel drama which is thoroughly engaging at first watching, less so on second viewing when the novel twist is known.",1432684800,,144,4.8
5552346,5,B00B1RB83Y,"Surprisingly good! The writing, acting, twist and turns - it's a nail-biter!
  Gave it 5 stars because it was evidently horrifically underrated. To think - had there been more insightful and braver BIG producers and directors, it may very well have been a ""BLOCKBUSTER""!!!",1389830400,2,272,5.159090909090909
5552347,5,B00B1RB83Y,It very rare for me to get to the end of a movie without being able to anticipate where it's headed. I really didn't see this one coming at all.,1382313600,,144,3.8333333333333335
5552348,4,B00B1RB83Y,"As an actor, I really enjoyed the acting in this. There are some great moments between the characters. It seems the director really allowed things to unfold and for the actors to take their time. Usually a three person film like this would be difficult to watch, but I was very much sucked in to the seedy world of these people. And I'm a sucker for Fairuza Balk. The end is a real surprise and was very clever. It's definitely worth a watch!",1378684800,,442,4.337349397590361
5552349,4,B00B1RB83Y,"Awesome concept. Fairuza Balk brings her signature dark, gravelly intellect to a character sitting at an interesting table. The film is a  role-shifting, blame-throwing, suspenseful mix with tension and depth. Enjoy the ride.",1371772800,,225,5.818181818181818
5552350,5,B00B1RB83Y,"This is basically a three ""man"" play that takes place inside of a bar. Matt (Ryan Merriman) the bar tender discovers a woman (Fairuza Balk) passed out on the restroom floor. She has apparently been beaten and raped. Tony (Rick Ravanello), the bar manager, is less concerned. He is a two strike ex-con who still snorts drugs.

When Rose comes to, she wants to discover which one of these guys did this to her. She plays mind games with them, antagonizes them and there are things that don't mesh, but too minor to be concerned about as the scene is too powerful and draws you away from the clue. As it turns out, Rose has multiple personality syndrome and moves smartly between characters. The action grows rather intense as we watch this personality driven script which at times is a dark comedy. Rose has two diverse personalities which are as diverse as Matt and Tony.

After an hour into the film, things come together, and then all hell breaks loose as the plot twists and twists and becomes a delicious pretzel. This is for people who love a smart indie film. Bravo writer/directer Christopher Glatis Bravo.

5552351,3,B00B1RB83Y,Whole movie started off extremely slow. Actually never really picked up until it was ALMOST over with. Good acting by all actors too. Overall I would recommend this to anyone who is a movie type of person...RW,1368576000,,209,4.675675675675675
5552352,3,B00B1RB83Y,"Although the story seemed to drag on and on and on, I have to say - it did ""get"" me in the end.  Had no idea & I like that.  But, it also leaves some big holes in the plot and story line that don't make sense but.....it did get me in the end.",1368230400,,242,3.462962962962963
5552353,1,B00B1RB83Y,The five star reviews must've come from the film maker's mother & friends. Over acting does not equal suspense. And as far as the shocking ending; you'll be shocked you wasted two hours watching this,1367020800,2,199,4.714285714285714
5552354,5,B00B1RB83Y,"Some pprobably read the story already but Dose Of Reality starts around at 2 in the morning. It's closing time for Matt (Ryan Merriman) a young bartender. When he happens to find an uncounscious, bloodied but gorgeous young woman (Fairuza Balk as Rose) on the bathroom floor, things immediately start to heat up from there. It grabs you and doesn't let go until the end.

Acting as politically correct as can be, Matt immediately warns the bar manager (Rick Ravanello from the Cave and Hart's war.) This manager though is eager to take care of Rose and everything else only once she wakes up instead of alerting the cavalry and this is just what will make this adventure the more fun. Learning about each character each turn and telling yourself that what you thought was right might be wrong more than once is inevitable while watching Dose of Reality. And just like what used to make many thrillers great in the past, one must listen to the characters and watch them act in order to understand the next step in their behavior. And even with its kind of 360 turn around shocker ending that dear god I DIDN'T SEE COMING, watching Dose or Reality's cat and mouse type of suspense left me with some sort of a buzz that i didn't really care if i would like the ending or not. Watching this movie one time only feels like having fun once in your life and not going back at it. The second time, the route to the end is as fun, assuming you can forget about watching a movie only to get to the end. If third time's the charm, i can hardly wait til i have some more time to see it once more.

This one is one hell of a ride. Filled with a couple characters that the average human being is bound to learn to hate, support, investigate and even encourage to act in some ways or other ways during the course of the story. I've watched a lot of movies, independant movies and if some people can't stand the amounts of monologues in some of them, let's say that Dose didn't even start to bore me on that aspect. And big part of the credit should go to Writer/Director Christopher Glatis on that part. Probably the most exciting and interesting thriller i've seen in years and exciting and interesting are 2 words that are too often ignored during this time of ridiculously gory and ridiculously stupid remakes of horror shockers and their characters trying to serve as today's heroes.

Long story short, if you can watch a thriller, you will be served a hell of a film with Dose and even more if you can listen to a movie. If you've ever been in a bar or anywhere else near your house, you know that people aren't all one colour and shade and The actors in Dose do depict a cast of interesting, complicated characters that convince me more about some differences between the men and women and between the human and animal. All with really funny text and action scenes.

Outsanding work by Rick Ravanello (The Cave, Hart's war), Ryan Merriman (Final Destination 3, The ring 2) and Fairuza Balk (The waterboy, American History x, the Craft) As a big fan of hers i was convinced she was one of the wonders of the ninethies (Talent wise.) when i was a teen. And you can easily grab that Dose of Reality if you love thrillers and realize this movie deserves way more credit than the commercial success it probably isn't yet. And after watching you'd be forced to say that this one's Fairuza Balk strongest performance to date and that is a big deal. She's amazing.

Have a Dose of a great film. And one hell of a ride. 9/10",1364688000,2,3506,4.421052631578948
5552355,4,B00B1RB83Y,"It's raw, sultry, fun, surprising... I saw a preview screening of this film in LA and REALLY enjoyed it. If you're a fan of intense, smart, slow-burn drama, (like David Mamet) where a few characters ram head-to-head and transform before your eyes, you definitely should check this out.

Fairuza Balk has never been better - she's electric, and haunted, and wounded, and powerful.

It's a kick-ass indie film that sticks to your ribs.",1364256000,2,433,4.917808219178082

8560997,1,B00B1RB83Y,"Rather than drive the plot, the premise and the characters utterly destroy it in the first ten minutes. It picks up speed on a downhill coast from there. It simply makes no sense, for a drug addled bunch of morons or otherwise, there's zero motivation to suspend the monumental amount of required disbelief. Fundamentally ""Dose of Reality"" is a ""Dose of Unreality"" case study in the utter stupidity of screwed up people creating a problem out of thin air. Sure I get it, dumb people do dumb things, but this? OK, let's roll with this...self destructive insecure individuals (again through complete stupidity) taking an easy to solve minor problem and making it dramatically worse for themselves at every turn with full on intent. Sort of like...what if two people (one with a criminal past of course) discovering a violent crime scene...break into a house, wipe any existing finger prints off of a murder weapon to replace them with their own, deposit all manner of DNA and bodily fluids all over the place (carefully as to condemn themselves entirely), roll around in the victims blood, then sit their and contemplate what to do about all this? Should they call the cops? They can't do that right??? On no!! Now what??? This isn't entertainment...this is pandering stupidity to a presumed moronic audience.",1525996800,,1307,4.945454545454545
8560998,2,B00B1RB83Y,"It's hard to watch a movie when from the start the two main guy characters are such jerks. SPOILER: Call the cops you morons, and an ambulance. You do NOT just crap around, when you have an unconscious patron, male or female lying on the floor in your restroom.
I turned off the player at that point.  Such idiocy.",1516406400,,314,4.322033898305085

8561000,4,B00B1RB83Y,"Where to even start?  This is definitely more than a unique twist on the ""stage play on film"" sort of production, though at its heart, that is the format.

Yes, there is the complex interwoven character study twists and turns that this starts out to be, and for much of the production almost up to the end, that's what it seems to be, more or less . . .

But wait for it, the final twist is definitely a twist that is more than worth it.

Unfortunately, it would be almost impossible to even hint at what is really awaiting the viewer without stumbling across the threshold of a spoiler boundary, so I just can't go there with this review.

What can be said here is kudos plus for Fairuza Balk, who delivers her character ""Rose"" about as effectively as any actress possibly could, she definitely has talent in this category.

As for the overall theme of the story, well, the take away message might be a popular phrase from a previous era, ""question reality"".  Particularly in today's world, perhaps more than ever, that message connects.

If anything, extra stars for a cleverly original concept, an evermore difficult task in today's world where virtually every conceivable plot and storyline that can be possibly imagined has been conjured up and rehashed endlessly over and over.

Oops, that might be a hint, sort of . . . OK, enough said.

A solid 4 stars for this one",1514419200,,1373,4.56734693877551
