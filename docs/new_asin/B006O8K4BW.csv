8501699,5,B006O8K4BW,"Dmitri Hvorostovsky died on November 22, 2017, barely past his 55th birthday. Now all of his recorded performances, audio and video, will be more precious as there will be no more! On June 28, 2008, Hvorostovsky had invited Sondra Radvanovsky to be his guest star in the prestigious Moscow concert series 'Hvorostovsky and Friends' with Conductor Constantine Orbelian and the Philharmonia of Russia in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, Moscow, Russia. Though these two opera stars were well acquainted and probably friends this was their first-ever musical collaboration. Thus there is documented for posterity one of those all-too-rare instances of magical artistic alchemy between two great operatic performers. Subsequently they appeared together in complete staged performances of 'Il Trovatore' at Covent Garden, the MET and The San Francisco Opera. (One or more of these may be available on DVD) These appearances were effusively acclaimed.  (In part program notes Lindsay Koob) There is also a compact disc available containing selections from the June 28th event, but, it is labeled 'Verdi Opera Scenes' and a bit of research is needed to determine that indeed it is from the same evening. Though the three encores labeled on that CD are not Verdi, but, Dvorak, Mozart and Puccini. Delos recorded this live concert and upon obtaining the film footage (a Russian TV show broadcast) collaborated with an expert film editor who synched the footage with the concert's audio. (Again in part Lindsay Koob). Unfortunately neither the DVD nor the CD contain the complete performance and each contains selections that the other does not include. And some selections even appear to be longer or shorter on one or the other. Furthermore both the CD at 54 minutes and the DVD at approximately 50 minutes are briefer in time signatures than the norm. This is especially disconcerting regarding the DVD as most DVD's of this nature are usually at least 90 minutes and often many more. Many CD's are 60 plus minutes and a few are even 70 minutes. Though most importantly what we have here are two outstanding operatic performers who bring an acting and singing intensity to a concert appearance that is rare and breathtaking. Conductor Orbelian displays special attention to his two singers and there is even a camera shot of an orchestra member with tears in the eyes. The Moscow audience seems more reserved than some, but, multiple bouquets of flowers are delivered to the stage after each and every selection.",1523145600,,2515,5.119221411192214
8501700,5,B006O8K4BW,Wonderful sound and video quality. Dmitri Hvorostovsky has a marvelous voice which ranges from the dramatic to almost lyrical. A wide selection of arias and songs. He has the talent to give each lyric its appropriate emotion. He interprets the arias with an actor's characterization and understanding.,1376092800,5,301,5.425531914893617

8501702,3,B006O8K4BW,"I am sorry to write that HALF of this DVD is of bad picture quality.
It is like DELOS know that the names Radvanovsky/Hvorostovsky sells and
they think they can release anything - even bad quality. I couldn't believe my eyes
and feel sorry for the hundreds of people who have already bought it.
What a shame DELOS!!!",1336867200,6,316,4.4655172413793105
8501703,5,B006O8K4BW,"I don't think there has been, is, or ever will be a greater stage duo than Hvorostovsky and Radvanvosky. Watching this DVD is, a truly magical experience.",1336521600,2,154,4.7407407407407405
8501704,5,B006O8K4BW,A great opportunity to see this silver-maned baritone in action together with the lovely soprano Sondra Radvanovsky. Hvorostovky and Radvanosky have a strong chemistry and it is a pleasure to watch.,1332288000,4,198,5.419354838709677
