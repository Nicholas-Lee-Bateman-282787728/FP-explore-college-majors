8257480,2,B00153ZQPU,"This was a great cartoon, and to be honest very late 80's and early 90's cartoon fun. This show brings you back to the 8 bit Nintendo era. I don't understand why N Circle released this single disc set when shout factory already had the complete series set available and reasonably priced. Since the Shout set is now out of print this would be a great pickup if you want to see the pilot and a few eps. Cheaper alternative now. The picture quality is nowhere as good as the shout release but manageable. Rumor was these came from NBC's broadcast masters and not DIC masters which are rumored to have been accidentally destroyed when Disney had the short-lived rights to all DIC productions.",1376352000,2,689,4.564516129032258
8257481,1,B00153ZQPU,"When I first saw this I was thinking about seasons where the charter Gameboy was in it. To cover is very misleading, and Im not happy with it. Even if price is low. Don't get! Unless you just want only first 4 eps of season 1.",1317081600,6,226,3.9347826086956523
8257482,5,B00153ZQPU,"There really is no reason to get this unless you want to try it before you buy the complete set.  These few episodes are much cheaper than the complete series if you don't like it.  You aren't out much money that way.  I happen to pick this small set up for a few bucks while I was out shopping one day.  I watched this show years ago and still love it I found.  So I recently ordered and received the complete series from Amazon.  If you are a fan of older cartoons from like the 80s and grew up with the old Nintendo, then you will more than likely like this set so you mind as well pick up the complete series that Amazon has to offer.",1279238400,,638,3.984251968503937
8257483,1,B00153ZQPU,"A year and a half ago, Shout! Factor brought us Captain N: The Game Master on DVD - something us old-school Nintendo fanboys had wanted for years. At long last, this classic, complete series had been released on DVD.

Considering the complete series is on DVD, there's no reason for further DVD releases....

....So what's the point of this package?

This collection retails for roughly $7 and only includes 4 episodes - Kevin in Videoland, Videolympics, Mr. And Mrs. Mother Brain, and Mega Trouble For Megaland. And NO bonus features (unless previews count.)
What angers me the most is that this set doesn't provide anything you couldn't get in the Complete Series box set.

And what's up with the bad episode choices? It's clear that this package was intended to include some First Season highlights. Kevin in Videoland is a given, it's the series pilot. And Mega Trouble For Megaland is one of the first season's best episodes. But the other two episodes, Videolympics and Mr And Mrs. Mother Brain, are utter jokes. How these got included here instead of, say, How's Bayou, Metroid Sweet Metroid, Three Men And A Dragon, or my personal favorite from Season One, The Most Dangerous Game Master, I will never know.

There are also NO BONUS FEATURES apart from the previews. Disappointing considering all the stuff that could have been used that wasn't in the Complete Series box sets - comic book scans, commercial bumpers, teasers, commercials, the list goes on. And while were at it, how much longer until we get the When Mother Brain Rules clip show, a non-defective version of Queen of the Apes, and the second version of How's Bayou on DVD?

This is a pointless budget DVD that gives us nothing we didn't already get on the Shout! Factory DVDs from last year. I'm hoping for a DVD supplement to the box set that includes alternate versions of episodes and other stuff the box set omitted - but this isn't it. Don't even bother with this set. Go directly to the Complete Series box set.",1216166400,16,1991,4.7398843930635834
8257484,5,B00153ZQPU,"I remember waking up on Saturday mornings and turning on ""NBC"" to watch this show. For years I used to also watch the ""Family chanel"" for this show as well. It is a rare gem this video is and I will play it and watch it for as long as the video holds out. I do have one request for ""Dic entertainment"" though. They should put all of these episodes on DVD's. It's cartoons like this that go by the way-side and are never heard about again unless you find them in good playable condition at a garage sale, or off of ""Ebay.""

The title of this episode is called, ""Game boy."" Everyone of course knows what a ""Game boy"" is by hnow. There are so many models of the hand held device on the market today. But, we're talking about the original ""Game boy"" that was produced by Nintendo in 1989.

In this episode, princess Launa's father ""King Charles"" is supposed to come home from the mirrior world that ""Mother brain"" has bannished him to. He makes it to the warp zone but decides that ""Game boy"" should go in his place instead of him coming home. This episode has action, heart felt monets, and comical moments in it. If you find this one? Keep it! Unless ""Dic entertainment"" puts these out on DVD, VHS is the way to go for now.",1126656000,2,1221,4.236051502145923
