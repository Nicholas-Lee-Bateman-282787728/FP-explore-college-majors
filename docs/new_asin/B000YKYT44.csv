8239271,3,B000YKYT44,"This video is for people familiar with dance or who learn well by watching. The instruction is through demonstration without explaination so a beginner or novice would not do well by using this video. However, the patterns and ammalgamation sequences are unique, stylish, practical, and effective to those with a working knowledge of the dance being demonstrated.",1354924800,,363,5.385964912280702
8239272,3,B000YKYT44,"It's not bad but the dancers could be better.  Watching those dancers kind of take something away from the steps she is trying to teach.  Some of the moves you would NOT use in a nightclub.  But to be fair, I did get a little out of this DVD.",1244505600,,242,3.8979591836734695
