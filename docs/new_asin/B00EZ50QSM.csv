5958128,5,B00EZ50QSM,"Kundalini Yoga for Abundance and Miracles is just that...Abundance and Miracles!  Karena is a gifted, special person who shares all of her self with everyone.  Karena's depth of spirituality takes you beyond what you can ever expect.  Her guidance is full of love and as you follow along, you are amazed at how different and wonderful you feel. That feeling stays with you and you look so forward to the next time.  In your day to day activities, you will notice how Karena's beautiful words will come to you, all on their own.  It's not the kind of DVD where you need to follow along, step by step, it just happens and flows naturally with Karena's beautiful voice and teachings.  I am thankful to Karena for sharing her knowledge, grace and love...a true blessing.  Thank you Karena for making a difference.",1381622400,2,809,4.695035460992908
5958129,5,B00EZ50QSM,"This is the best yoga video I have ever seen.  Really life changing.  Karena is amazing - the wisdom she brings, radiance and kindness are so apparent. Her message is genuine, and deeply touching. The way she demonstrates the yoga is beautiful and so inspiring - I love it. And there is no hype. She is so peaceful, so real, and is obviously not reading lines, but speaking from the heart, the whole time. I am really blown away.  And its true that it is much more than the normal kind of yoga video.  The yoga is great, but Karena goes beyond just yoga, and the message really touched my soul - that miracles are our natural way. And then she teaches the techniques to develop that. And she makes it simple. I wish the whole world could see this. This video is going to be my gift to about a dozen different people this year!",1381449600,,826,4.2756410256410255
5958130,5,B00EZ50QSM,This DVD is just what I need in my stressful life! Karena is pure grace and fills me with hope and relaxation!,1381449600,3,110,4.045454545454546
5958131,5,B00EZ50QSM,"This is so much more than a yoga video. Yes, you will get a workout but you will also get an awakening. Karena is a gentle, loving teacher who guides you to a place of real awareness. Her work is truly blessed and she is such a wonderful introduction not only to kundalini yoga but also to inner work, the work of the heart. Prepare yourself to experience abundance and miracles from a place of real beauty within. For me, this video helps me to remember the beauty of this life around me. It reminds me to be open and aware of all of the miracles around me and the abundance that this life offers. It wakes me up to my own beauty and gifts of love and light. That is my miracle. I sent this video to a dear friend who has suffered from insomnia and anxiety for many years. I told her ""Just try it. Karena's gentle voice alone is enough to help you feel peace."" My friend now does the yoga in the morning to start her day and to center herself. And she puts it on at night just to listen while she falls asleep. She says it has truly helped her. That is her miracle. What is yours? :)",1381449600,7,1084,4.070093457943925
5958132,5,B00EZ50QSM,Karena's energy and grace is amazing. She is a natural healer. This is the perfect gift for anyone.  Spread the wonderful experience. -Lisa M,1381449600,2,141,4.875
5958133,5,B00EZ50QSM,"I love this . It is so much more than a great yoga DVD, it is an inspirational ,uplifting , and beautiful message to all . Karena shares her wisdom and we all benefit. Her compassion and sensitivity shine through throughout this DVD.
You can select different chapters  based on relaxation, or energy, or do all at once. I like to select chapters based on what I feel like. If I need energy, I will do the flowing energy chapter, if I'm feeling stressed, I will do the relaxation chapter, sometimes I just put it on for inspiration. I highly recommend this  DVD  to all.",1386028800,4,569,4.4
5958134,5,B00EZ50QSM,"Please note that unlike 90% of the reviews posted when I wrote this review, I do not know Karena Virginia personally nor have I taken a live class with her.  I am a long time avid exercise dvd purchaser who enjoys adding Kundalini Yoga to the mix.  I have at least ten Ana/Ravi dvds plus some dvds by other kundalini teachers.  I actually bought this dvd because I was frustrated by the reviews on here from all her friends and students and wanted to see first hand if the dvd was legitimate - - and it is.

The instructor is Karena Virginia.  The music is from various dvds by Snatam Kaur who is one of my favorites.  The instruction is done in voice over with Ms. Virgina doing the demonstration.  The production value is very high and Ms. Virgina is stunning.  The dvd is broken down into six parts and alternates between each part with a teaching/spoken session which is filmed outside or in natural light.  The ""set"" appears to be the living room of a grand mansion and it is gorgeous.  Ms. Virgina wears the standard white clothing and does her yoga on the also standard white fur rug.

She opens with a 7:30 talk  where in she describes what the intentions of the dvd are and explains important concepts.  Then we move into the standard tune-in which is a recorded song by Snatam Kaur. (Note the dvd is chaptered so you can skip this after you have listened to it once if you want to.)

Part 1 - Warm-up = this is a standard 10 minutes warm-up with moves that will be familiar to anyone who has done a kundalini dvd or taken a class.

Part 2 - Flowing Energy - this kryia or set is to open energy fields and alternates strenuous exercises like frogs with slower ones like standing hip circles to make this an invigorating set without being too difficult. this set is 12 minutes.

Part 3 - Abundance - this is the classic Yogi Bhajan kriya for the Auric Field that is done on Mantra Girl's first dvd.  This section is approximately 12 minutes.  This is one of my favorite kriya's and I do it often in my private practice usually followed by 11 minutes of changing the ""Har"" mantra. Note: this kriya is push-ups in downward dog with one leg lifted and then follows a seated series where you move the arms.

Part 4 - Miracles - This section is 15 minutes and it is done seated and it is similar to the ""endurance"" style kryia's that Ravi/Ana have had on their newer dvds where you do a series or repeated movements for a long time which are usually arm movements in seated position.  Mr. Virginia states that the theme of this exercise is ANGELS. A - align. N - now.  G - gratitude.  E - embrace.  L - love.  S - surrender.  This one is challenging especially after having done the Auric Field kryia which was also focused on the arms.  I have always felt the  point of these ""endurance"" exercises is to move past the pain and into a moving meditation.  Ms. Virginia paces the movements well and her music and spoken words are very motivating and help in keeping your arms lifted even when you want to stop.

Part 5 - Deep Relaxation - Corpse pose with guided relaxation for 10 minutes

Part 6 - Gratitude - She describes a beautiful meditation but she talks the whole time and I would have preferred she just did the mediation in a guided form.  However, I really liked the mediation and will do it in my private practice. She then ends the dvd telling a personal story about how kundalini yoga and mediation has helped her in hard times. This section is eight minutes and her story is very moving.

This is a good dvd and should appeal to people who enjoy this style of turbanless kundalini yoga dvds made popular by husband and wife team, Ana and Ravi.  The production is one of the best I have seen for this style of dvd.  The music is beautiful although a slightly move driving or rock beat might have helped in the Miracles section.  As for the instructor, she is everything all her friends and students claim her to be in their reviews.  Her aura shines very brightly and she is indeed a poster child for radiance and a shining aura. Her technique is superb and she has good cueing.  Her voice is kind and gentle while always being easy to understand - - - HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",1384387200,48,4185,4.3604651162790695
5958135,5,B00EZ50QSM,This DVD is amazing. Karena is a wonderful teacher of yoga. I attend her classes a few times a week including Kundalini yoga and I feel so good during the classes and after.  This DVD is a perfect gift for everyone who is looking for inspiration and relaxation.,1383868800,,261,4.4375
5958136,5,B00EZ50QSM,I have the privilege of attending Karena's Kundalini classes in person. There's been many times when after class I've experienced miracles. When you open your mind to them they appear. If our world leaders participated in this we would see peace. This is something you really need to experience yourself.,1382486400,3,304,5.1
5958137,5,B00EZ50QSM,"If you are wondering what yoga is all about buy this video.  Within a visually appealing  setting, Karena will launch you on a journey of awakening within yourself  a higher level of  awareness of both your physical/emotional sides.  She will give you the tools to achieve harmony in your everyday life through working towards the delicate balance of both these inner worlds.  If you already have a yoga practice buy this video;  give yourself the rare opportunity of access to a teacher whose unique style will both help and challenge you to elevate your practice to an even higher  level of self-awareness/harmony in your everyday life.

5958138,5,B00EZ50QSM,"I have known Karena for a couple of years. She is an amazing yoga instructor and it carries over into her personal life. She lives mind, body and spirit. I was thrilled to purchase this DVD and have the ability to have Karena with me any time of day. I am happy for others that they can practice with Karena also.

5958139,5,B00EZ50QSM,"Karena Virginia is a blessing in my life. When we first met, I felt I was in the presence of someone truly special. Her honesty and sincerity in sharing her wisdom and light has been a precious gift. She graciously shares her loving spirit with all those she encounters. I direct all of my friends who wish to move into a more positive form of existence to Karena's website and Facebook page. I am grateful for all she has taught me and for every moment I am privileged to spend with her. Through Karena, I have learned to trust in myself, to love more deeply and to believe in miracles. God blessed us all when he created Karena.",1381708800,,630,4.3474576271186445
5958140,5,B00EZ50QSM,An open mind and heart can give us the power to transform life's woes into blessings.  That is what came through to me as I interacted with this wonderful DVD.  What a gift Karena has bestowed on all of us.,1381708800,,206,4.125
5958141,5,B00EZ50QSM,"Karena exudes graceful strength and embodies the divine feminine that invites in abundance and miracles in life. Her angelic light can brighten even the darkest room.

5958142,5,B00EZ50QSM,"Karena is an angel among us, and a gift to this world. Her grace and wisdom are profound and inspiring.

I highly recommend her as a teacher and an inspiration to us all.",1381708800,3,314,4.7272727272727275
8610613,5,B00EZ50QSM,Karena's message is so clear and beautiful. It actually seems to have opened up a new understanding in me and I now get so much more out of the exercises themselves.  I have been doing the practices and feeling more and more empowered every day... it has been a couple weeks now. So amazing! This DVD has both a beautiful message plus very transformational yoga and meditations. I highly highly recommend it. I totally love this DVD.,1443052800,,433,4.623376623376624
8610614,1,B00EZ50QSM,"It is so annoying to have to fast forward through so much talking!

I don't get why more teachers don't think to limit the jabbering to a specific segment on the dvd. That way beginners can learn what they need to, and intermediates and advanced don't have to listen to relentless talking. She even chattered through shivasana! It was a guided relaxation, but really, who needs someone to guide you to relax? I thought about it afterwards and realized that if I practiced to this dvd frequently, I would go berserk.

Ms. Virginia's prompts to alert you to the next pose are inconsistent and often unclear, so I spent a lot of time with one eye open because she'd all of a sudden change to another position or pose without any clear prompt. And she doesn't actually tune in and tune out. She just plays song excerpts with the opening and closing mantras in them. Why doesn't she just tune in and out properly for heaven sake?

Kundalini Yoga is the yoga of awareness and I am fully aware that I will never practice this yoga set again.",1440288000,,1034,4.48936170212766
8610615,3,B00EZ50QSM,The exercises on this DVD are amazing. It has only been a couple of weeks since I have begun (I do the exercises daily for 40 days) and I've already noticed a change. The only real problem that I have with this DVD is that Karena talks WAY TOO MUCH! I have to constantly skip over her incessant blathering. Very annoying! Why she felt the need to talk throughout the DVD is beyond me.,1428624000,2,384,4.202702702702703
8610616,5,B00EZ50QSM,This is one of the best yoga DVDS I've ever seen or worked with.  Karena not only shares her extensive knowledge and wisdom on the topic but her sensitivity and compassion as well.  The sessions are displayed in a well organized and easy to understand manner.  I would recommend this DVD to those who not only want a great workout but a better understanding of how yoga can enhance and better one's life.,1415491200,,404,4.506849315068493
8610617,4,B00EZ50QSM,"I am someone who purchased this DVD after amazon.com suggested it. I haven't taken Karena Virginia's class, but I wanted to give it a try in DVD format.

I am a bit disappointed with the format of the DVD.
For most computer users, Microsoft Media Player is the norm for DVD playing.
This DVD is not in an effective format for that program. I am not, for example, able to fast forward with the slider.
Segments are separated by a picture of a large rose and a title screen, making the practice choppy using this player.

I fixed the problem using VLC media player, but I thought other potential purchasers should know that
they will likely need to be proactive.

As for the content, the scene changes were a bit awkward. They went from a lovely natural setting to a mansion. The purpose of the set must have been to increase production value, but the background was distracting to me, having just switched from greenery.

I really enjoyed the music used. It was a very effective choice. There is quite a bit of instructive talking, but I happen to like some background to my kundalini. The personal story at the end of the DVD was very touching.

The majority of this DVD is approachable for complete beginners or those reasonably familiar with kundalini yoga. There are a few poses that would be difficult for some with body problems or the unfit. If downward facing dog with your leg lifted up sounds like a nightmare to you (even though it's only a very brief part of the DVD), perhaps a more gentle practice would be appropriate.",1404259200,2,1532,4.556363636363637
8610618,3,B00EZ50QSM,"It was fine, but the flow was hindered by the format of her talking so much in between practice sections.  You don't want to have to keep grabbing the controller in order to fast forward through them.  Otherwise, the practice itself is fine - a LOT of arm movement - more than other practices I've done.  But she has a beautiful presence and nice instruction.",1403049600,5,359,4.492307692307692
8610619,5,B00EZ50QSM,"I bought this DVD during a very stressful time.  I found it to be peaceful, joyous and meditative.  It worked wonders for me!",1397001600,,125,4.391304347826087
8610620,5,B00EZ50QSM,"This DVD is a gift to me.  I travel frequently and am able to take Ms. Karena Virginia's teaching on the road with me.  She is exceptionally talented, grounded and gifted.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone just beginning yoga and to the highly experienced yoga practitioner.",1394668800,2,279,4.770833333333333
8610621,5,B00EZ50QSM,"This is totally different from my other kundalini yoga dvds, but I totally love it!  Haven't had time to use it much during the holidays, but I plan on getting started on a regular bases in the new year....",1388620800,,206,4.282051282051282
8610622,5,B00EZ50QSM,I have practiced yoga with many different DVDs. This is by far the best yoga DVD I have ever purchased! I highly recommend it to everyone.,1386806400,,138,4.346153846153846
