8466916,3,B005DJ7B1E,"I recorded the original broadcast Nova: Rebuilding Ground Zero series, 6 one-hour episodes documenting the new tower, the Memorial, Museum, artifacts, personal accounts and reflections of 9/11 and the decade of rebuilding that has followed... in all a great and memorable series. I mistakenly thought this was the DVD equivalent, but quickly discovered that this is a single hour, mostly the highlights of that 6-part series. Much has been eliminated that needs to be viewed, my personal opinion.

It's OK, but found it superficial; I highly recommend the original Nova series if you can find it.",1376179200,5,596,5.208333333333333
8466917,5,B005DJ7B1E,"Another great Nova documentary.
A fascinating examination of the technology deployed to rebuild One World Trade Center.
A moving insight into the design and construction of the memorial next to it.
I was left with some optimism regarding what has been done by the people working at Ground Zero.",1316044800,4,294,5.020408163265306
