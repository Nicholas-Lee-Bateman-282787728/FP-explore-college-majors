8100007,5,B000CPGYIK,This is a must see for any football (soccer) fan.  In my opinion Best was the most talented player.  A sad life though.,1352764800,,119,4.130434782608695
8100008,3,B000CPGYIK,"If you're a fan, you'll want this. It's a nice memento to look back on since George's death. It's slick and nicely produced. But if you're looking for any insight into the man and the player, this DVD will leave you short. The DVD is mostly a resume of George's time at Manchester United; it's not a biography. It's bolstered by interviews in the style of gentle reminiscences by old men in their armchairs with a nod to the fact that he was a bit of a lad without raking up too much controversy. There are 50 goals but not all of the best. Best was firey and passinate when he played; the DVD is gentle.  After you've watched it, if you didn't live through the Best era, you'll grant that he was obviously a good player but you'll still be wondering what all the fuss was about.",1140048000,,779,4.263513513513513
