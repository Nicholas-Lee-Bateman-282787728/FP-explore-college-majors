8626066,5,B00GP9AT74,Loved it. Sorry that I can't  get part two. They no longer have it available.,1530662400,,77,4.133333333333334
8626067,4,B00GP9AT74,"According to Acorn TV, Crownies is a prequel to Janet King. If you are not familiar with Janet King then do view it, marvelous series. This series follows five young solicitors in Australia working with the senior Crown lawyers in the Office of Public Prosecutions in Sydney. Now, the seniors are to be mentors, and sometimes that works,

Line all young professionals these new to the bar, have a great deal to learn. They are very active outside of their jobs if you understand my dig. A lot of flirting and extra additional duties for some. Not sure who wrote the scripts but I could do quite as good a job. The sex is there and handled in quite a junior position, but love does not seem to be in the cards. There are storylines for each new Crownie, and it isquite easy to become involved in the episodes.

There are 22 episodes, and each one is relatively good. But the real story comes when Janet King, played by Marta D&uuml;sseldorp comes along to show off her professional skills.  Her personal life is also in ficus, and if you have seen Janet King you know what I mea . This is the best of the episodes, and I can understand how her Series came to be.

8626069,4,B00GP9AT74,"Crownies is a great introduction to the character of Janet King, brilliantly played by Marta Dusseldorp.  Learning about the Australian judicial system was also interesting.  I deducted a star because of the unrealistic outfits, especially in the first episode. Some of the actors in Crownies continue in the two Janet King seasons:  Lewis Fitz (David Sinclair), Andrea Demetriades (Lena Blair), Hamish Michael (Richard Stirling) and Christopher Morris (Andy Campbell).  Watching the developing interaction of these characters is wonderful.  The best character, though, is Janet King, because of how Marta Dusseldorp portrays her,",1486944000,2,630,5.804347826086956

I sent an email prior to ordering to confirm that it would play in Blu-Ray players here in the US because I wanted to be 100% sure prior to ordering.  I was assured that the Blu-Ray would play here.  When it came in the mail, it would not play in my player.  The product itself is even coded as ""B"" Region only, right on the back of the Blu-Ray.",1417737600,17,428,4.120481927710843

Love all the actors in the Crownies.",1400457600,,229,3.9565217391304346
