1047689,3,6305588287,"I saw part of this movie being made on scene. It's a little corny, but still a great film with a surprised ending.",1413331200,,114,4.0

1047692,1,6305588287,Can't give review. Wasn't the movie I thought it was so I returned it,1405382400,,69,4.0
1047693,1,6305588287,Avoid this movie.  Marlon Brando should have been embarrassed to appear.  I was embarrassed to watch him make a fool of himself.  This film was made by Canadians whose motive it seems was to sully American cinema and American greatness.,1381708800,,236,4.85
1047694,4,6305588287,"I  was reading a biography of Marlon Brando and this movie was portrayed by the author as a huge embarrassment for the actor. Yah, he had more than his share of celluloid bombs, but this isn't one of them. It reminds me of a Coen brothers film. And Brando's performance is hilarious and you can see him having fun with the character he plays. He looks like an overweight Captain Kangaroo. The other actors { Sheen , Sorvino, and Sutherland}  are O.K. in their roles. It's Brando that you can't take your eyes off of. He only made one more film after this "" The Score"" and that was more of a cameo. This was his last starring role in a movie and it is worth watching.",1375228800,,666,4.2362204724409445
1047695,1,6305588287,"This movie is really bad.  Stupid, goes nowhere.  I kept watching waiting for it to get beter...it never does.  Save your time and money, move on to another flick.  Concur with several previous posts, great talent present but just doesn't pull it/anything off.  I guess someone might think parts of this were funny, I must've missed the jokes.",1368835200,,343,4.844827586206897
1047696,4,6305588287,"I thoroughly enjoyed Marlon Brando as the semi-crazed overprotective father.  He was a great actor.  The rest of the cast, even Charelie Sheen, performs well.",1368144000,,158,5.28
1047697,4,6305588287,"It was falsely list that Patrick Swayze was in it but, not. But it did turn out to be an okay movie anyway. I like some of the actors in it. Thank you could do business again.",1368057600,,175,3.7567567567567566
1047698,1,6305588287,"I watched ""Free Money"" last night (heck I even rented it!) and I haven't been as thoroughly disappointed in a movie in a LONG time.  This movie has NOTHING to offer.  I watched it because I am (was?) a big fan of Brando (the actor).  He's clunked before (ever see ""Desiree""?) but at least his scripts all had possibilities.  Did he read this script before signing on?  There was nothing there!  This is worse than a bad Three Stooges movie.  Come to think of it, I owe the Three Stooges an appology.  There was talent in the movie but in name only; all the actors were way under par.  There was nothing creative or intepretive in Brando who looks like he's 400 lbs.  He looked that way in ""Don Juan Demarco"" and carried it off with a pretty good performance.  He just looks fat and ... well, I'll try and keep to a higher plane.  The humor was on the 6th grade level.  I watched through to the end as a public service.  There is no scene in the movie that warrents watching it.  I better quit; it's not worth spending this much time on it.",1301011200,2,1039,4.229591836734694
1047779,5,6305588287,"I initially avoided this film  even though I'd heard of it because I knew it had gone straight to video so thought it must be terrible. But then a friend and I caught some clips on YouTube and thought they were so hilarious, we decided to buy the DVD, and we're glad we did. We just watched the film tonight and thought it was hilarious. It's sometimes bizarre what films will get a general release and which ones--despite major stars--will go straight to video. If you're not a fan of the offbeat and quirky, you won't like this film, but if you are, you may just love it. Incidentally, another film I thought was hilarious and went straight to video was Peter O'Toole's THE FINAL CURTAIN. If you liked FREE MONEY then check out THE FINAL CURTAIN, both dark, quirky comedies that flew under the radar. Brando is like the Rolling Stones, in that the cliche attitude is that they both peaked before 1975...but when you actually take the time to check out their later work, you'll find the greatness is still largely intact. Brando really gives an original and energetic (despite his weight) and wonderful performance in his film.",1262304000,,1128,4.64
1047780,1,6305588287,"If you thought ""A Countess From Hong Kong"" was a low point in the Marlon Brando filmography, wait until you stumble upon this made-in-Canada turkey. A disastrous black comedy, ""Free Money"" (1998) proved unfit for theatrical consumption and received a straight-to-video burial. Brando's final starring role as an orange-haired prison warden is a grotesque embarrassment in a cinematic apocalypse all its own.",1247616000,2,407,5.580645161290323
1047781,5,6305588287,"It took me awhile to recognize Marlon Brando and was unaware he could be so funny. I hadn't seen ""Streetcar Named Desire"" with the suddenly silly ""Stanley"" lines. The twins were likeably stupid and shallow, and PERFECT for the equally 'stupid' husbands they trapped. VERY enjoyable. Lots of laughing throughout. Too bad this film wasn't more appreciated, publicly.",1244160000,,364,5.293103448275862
1047782,1,6305588287,Save your time and money.  This movie is an embarrassment to the cast.  I cannot believe that the likes of Brando and Sutherland were involved in this waste of celluloid.,1203811200,4,170,4.633333333333334
1047783,5,6305588287,"This is one of my favorite movies. I'm a fan of offbeat comedies like Stay Tuned, FRAUDS, Austin Powers and George of the Jungle, so this fits in my collection perfectly.
Thomas Haden Church really stands out as the dumb, loveable, cuddly Larry Lumstrum. He has an unusual shock of yellowish white hair, odd for him, he has golden blonde hair!
Larry might remind viewers of Lowell Mather from Wings. To tell you the truth, Larry IS Lowell Mather with white hair.
My favorite scene has to be when Larry is stuck in the black Dodge truck as the train is zooming for the vehicle. It reminds one of Marty McFly trying to jump out of the doomed DeLorean near the end of Back To The Future Part III.",1030320000,8,693,4.37984496124031
1047784,4,6305588287,"The picture is by no means great, but for the first time in decades Brando is clearly having fun here, and there is no actor more enjoyable to watch have fun than Marlon Brando. It is by no means his best performance, but as he chews the scenery, savoring every bite he is a joy to watch.",999216000,11,288,4.0701754385964914
1047785,5,6305588287,"This movie, with its superb cast, starts out as a lighthearted comedy.  All of a sudden, it takes a hard left turn - leaving the viewer wondering, ""What happened?  Is this the same movie I was watching a minute  ago?"" I rented this movie on tape, and enjoyed it so much that I  rewound it and watched it again! Great performances by all and a cleverly  written interlocking storyline make this one a keeper.  The cameo of Martin  Sheen near the end was a cute touch. I just ordered the DVD.",955497600,8,490,4.318681318681318
1047786,1,6305588287,"If you are a Brando fan like me you have probably wanted to see this movie, but had trouble finding it, or did not want to buy it.  Worry no longer it is a total waste of time.  I believe it is heading in the  direction of a dark comedy, but it falls well short.  The plot is stupid,  the characters are stall and sometimes annoying, and it is simply not  funny.  Brando has taken questionable roles before, but this one really  leaves me shaking my head.  He is the best actor in the world, yet he does  all these bad movies.  Oh yeah, if you are a Charlie Sheen fan you will  also want to pass on this because this is CHARLES Sheen, not Charlie.  The  new Charles is even worse than he alter ego, Charlie.  I give this movie  one star just because Brando is in it.",953769600,10,766,4.040268456375839
1047787,5,6305588287,"Brando is absolutely charming and hilarious in this dark comedy and the writing is first-rate.  The cinematography of the woods and country is breathtaking and you really get a sense of this ""small town"" from  the script and acting.  Sheen and Church are fabulous in their parts  although Sheen sometimes speaks a little fast in some of the comic  punchlines, so seeing it more than once would be of benefit.  The twin  girls are lovely and cute and I daresay we may see more of them in future  films.",948931200,7,501,4.550561797752809
7891550,1,6305588287,"complete waste of time, it's not sure if it wants to be a comedy or a drama, it's neither. Boring, dull garbage. Full of big name actors who probably were just trying to get paid for doing nothing.",1512950400,,197,4.2105263157894735
7891551,3,6305588287,"Three stars for VHS-quality DVD transfer. It's letterboxed, not true widescreen, but the compression artifacts and lack of definition might make you forget about the black bars on all 4 sides of your widescreen display. Note that there are no English subtitles. Overall, it's a bit crude, and below ""standard' for its date of manufacture.",1479081600,,338,5.163636363636364
7891552,3,6305588287,"Overall entertaining. Well acted though goofy and crude.

 Young Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church. Never understood the big deal about Marlon Brando. He was just okay.

If you enjoy My Name is Earl, you might enjoy this film.",1466380800,,230,4.846153846153846
