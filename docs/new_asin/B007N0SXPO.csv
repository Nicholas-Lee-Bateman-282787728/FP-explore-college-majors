8519608,5,B007N0SXPO,This is a great Blu-ray/DVD for Gorka fans. It's like a private concert in your living room.,1473724800,,92,4.470588235294118
8519609,5,B007N0SXPO,"John Gorka is a bit of an off the radar hidden gem. You have to like laid back acoustic music with a very rich and warm guitar style and same for that man's wonderful voice. Although slightly different in their styles, John and David Wilcox might be brothers from different mothers...",1467417600,2,284,4.588235294117647
8519610,5,B007N0SXPO,"All I had was a partial song ""The Gypsy Life"" that I had been listening to for about 8 months. I had just wanted 96/24bit audio, but I didn't know how to get it besides buying the blu ray album. I wanted this particular version because my ears grew accustomed to it. Finally I found a way to extract flac from dvds, then I purchased this album. I didn't realize this was actually filmed and recorded. Previously I had bought The Beatles Love dvd but it had no video, it was just audio. I didn't expect to have video on this, and can't believe how excellent this dvd looked and sounded on my cheap 5.1 Sony player and Vizio big screen. Man, this is a great find.",1452729600,2,661,4.21259842519685
8519611,4,B007N0SXPO,"Loved listening and watching John Gorka in this video, along with the talented friends that accompanied him. I was Particulary  please to hear that fretless bass back again.
 Missing was his dry sense of humor and short entertaining stories.
That said, his voice still makes me swoon and for that, I have no regrets in this purchase.",1413072000,4,333,4.824561403508772
8519612,5,B007N0SXPO,"Excellent, vintage Gorka offering quality, intelligence and real music.  I recommend this to anyone looking for real american music and other interested folks.",1391385600,2,159,5.913043478260869
8519613,5,B007N0SXPO,"This Blu-ray definitely lived up to AIX Records' usual standards.  A very intimate setting captured on true HD video as well as audio.  The audio on this Blu-ray sounds great!  Watch and listen as John Gorka and fellow musicians tenderly work their way through 19 songs.  A definite treat was hearing John Gorka cover Townes Van Zandt's ""Snow Don't Fall"".  The usual ""stage"" and ""audience"" perspectives that AIX Records is known for delivering are spot on once again.",1341878400,4,467,4.935897435897436
8519614,5,B007N0SXPO,"John Gorka sings very personal songs that manage to connect with all of us. His baritone voice, guitar playing and clever twist of a phrase (""I Saw A Stranger With You Hair"") make his one of the best of the new folk movement. This Blu-ray disc provides incredible sonic fidelity in a personal presentation...they guy and his band are in the room with you. The video is show on a stage but without a live audience. The whole package id wonderful.",1339286400,3,445,4.506172839506172
