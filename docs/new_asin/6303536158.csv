672000,1,6303536158,"This video was such a disappointment!  I thought when we bought it that my 5 -1/2 yr old would really LOVE the video, but I was wrong.  I was horrified to realize that Hello Kitty and Mimi's friends DEVOUTLY  disbelieved in Santa Claus!  When Kitty & Mimi said that he was real,  their friends all laughed at them and told them that they didn't believe in  him because they had ""KNOWN"" that he wasn't real for a long time!  They made fun of Kitty & Mimi for believing in him.  My daughter and I  watched this about a week before Christmas last year, and I felt TERRIBLE  about not being able to just turn it off and forget about it.  Instead, we  watched on . . .  and I tried the best I could to reassure her that Santa  IS real . . . I still think this video was and is the reason she seems to  doubt the magical, wonderful spirit of Christmas which lives in Santa's  heart!  This video is fine for kids who already have doubts, but DON'T let  your sweet little girl or boy watch this video if they are still innocent  and awestruck by the magical wonder of Christmas (and Santa! )  The only  positive thing about this video is that, in the end of their magical  journey to find Santa's missing hat, Santa gives Mimi or Kitty a special  toy sled which turns into a real one and drives them home.  When they get  back, they both think it was a dream . . .until they find that they still  have that special gift from Santa Claus -magically turned back to toy size!  = ^.^ =",957571200,12,1473,4.131205673758865

7849496,5,6303536158,"I LOVE this Hello Kitty special! It introduced me to anime, it introduced me to Christmas nostalgia! I don't care what any sterotype says, I loved this tape as a child! The other two Christmas tapes we had, ""Little Drummer Boy"" and ""Santa Clause Is Coming To Town"" were not that bad, they just didn't do too much for me.  ""  ""Santa's Missing Hat"" balanced drama, sweetness, winter adventure, and enchantment. It actually made me cry! I saw a few other Hello Kitty episodes and they were okay-ish, but didn't have the same charm as ""Santa's Missing Hat"". I do really wish this special would be uploaded on YouTube ( In english to be exact). I have managed to find it on DVD, but chances to see this are sadly kind of rare. In addition, the Kerropi segment was just as good. Helping Twinkle to get up in the sky in time for Christmas- that's wonderful! That introduced me to Kerropi as well. I liked him too. I also like watching this around Christmas. Like Hello Kitty , I tried the other Kerropi episodes and they were okay but still didn't spark the way this Christmas episode did.  The last segment with Kuppi the reindeer, eh, wasn't horrible or even that bad, but it didn't quite have the same magic as the ""Hello Kitty"" or ""Kerropi"" segments, or even ""Rudolph"". Overall, I really enjoy this. Whenever I think of Hello Kitty, or Kerropi, these Christmas episodes usually come to mind first. I don't know what else to say, I just love it.",1383609600,,1441,4.49236641221374
7849497,5,6303536158,"I watched this when I was little. It's not a terrible movie to not show your kids. Hello Kitty meets Santa proving that he IS real and shows how her parents lost the Christmas ""spark"". It's a classic.",1351987200,,200,4.2894736842105265
7849498,5,6303536158,"I used to love this movie as a little girl! Every single Christmas I would look forward to watching this video and even today at ninteen years of age I still enjoy watching it. I have absolutely no clue what all of these women are talking about. There is NOTHING to be disappointed about! I never stopped believing in Santa after watching this movie. Why would I? Obviously these mothers haven't really stopped and observed what happens at the end of the movie; Santa actually is real and Kitty & Mimi do end up seeing him out their window on Christmas Eve. This movie and others are such a huge part of my Christmas experience as a child. I can't even imagine growing up without them! Hello Kitty is amazing and I will always love "" Hello Kitty: Santa's Missing Hat"".",1272412800,,768,4.453900709219858
7849499,5,6303536158,"My daughter and I loved this video.  I am always baffled when parents get upset that this video ""suggests"" to their innocent children that Santa Claus might not be real.  This concept is ubiquitous - havn't your kids ever seen a version of ""A Christmas Story""?  Santa Claus is not real, and why is it so important to you to perpetuate a falsehood as long as possible?  Also, why would one reader immediately blame the country of Japan.  This demonstrates extreme ethnocentricity, provinciality and ignorance.  This DVD could have been made anywhere.  One reader blamed Japan for trying to destroy thousands of american Christians [mis]beliefs.  Santa was invented by the Coca-Cola Company.  To think that it has a religious foundation at all is ignorant and degrades your religion.  Anyway, it was a great video.",1100304000,,812,4.992537313432836
7849500,1,6303536158,"tape to anyone where it may be viewed by innocent little children who still believe in the magic of Santa Claus. We just made the HUGE mistake of showing this tape to our 2,4,6, and 8 year olds. We are so careful about the videos and TV shows that our children watch, but who would have thought that we would have had to screen this entire tape for content before showing it to our little ones. Not only does it have a scene where school children are poking fun at Kitty for believing in Santa Claus, it then puts the idea in the children's heads that Mommy and Daddy just buy all of the Christmas presents when Kitty confronts her parents. At this point in the video, we couldn't even turn it off and leave this idea hanging, we desparately hoped that the video will work itself out. Then there was a scene where Kitty catches her Dad dressed up like Santa, leaving them presents, and his diguise gets uncovered when his hat blows off. He then confesses to his children, "" Well I think your old enough now for me to tell you that there is no such thing as Santa."" Sort of justifying the parental deception (believe me, it is worse than I described). I have got to beleive that every person that had anything to do with the creation, production and distribution of this video are TOTAL MORONS. Our daughter has alot of ""Hello Kitty""  products, I will NEVER purchase another thing from this company again. It almost seems that the Japanese firm that produces Hello Kitty sadistically put this video tape out knowing that it could destroy the belief in Santa Claus to thousands of American children. Because other than that, I can't possibly justify the stupidity of the people that work for this company. I apologize for being so negative, but I feel I have to warn other parents. The only thing I regret about this review is that you can't rate it lower than 1 star.",1069891200,6,1866,4.456140350877193
7849501,3,6303536158,"I love Hello Kitty! I wanted to introduce her to my daughter, and so I was so happy to have found this video before Christmas.
 But, like a few of the other reviewers..I was VERY disappointed they brought up the concept that Santa isn't real!!
 For the little ones who aren't even beginning to think he isn't real, this could plant that very idea in thier head. Granted, it all works out in the end, and Santa is proven to be real by Kitty and Mimi...but still...I don't like that they even mentioned that Santa may not be real.
 My daughter is too young to realize what they were talking about, but if she were a bit older, I think she would have been asking me questions about it..and then I would have been even more mad!!
 I would say that kids over 7 or so could understand this video, but don't show it to the younger and still innocent set!! It may jade thier minds!
 I will say if it wasn't for the ""I don't believe in Santa"" factor..I would have loved this video. The rest of it was very cute.
 I hope Sanrio comes out with a better Christmas Hello Kitty video! For now I will just be buying another Hello Kitty video, and putting this one away for a long, long time.",1013472000,,1176,4.204444444444444
