3657463,2,B001JAHPFI,"This 1987 Season of Airwolf was the season when USA tried to revive the show after CBS had cancelled AIRWOLF in the Spring of 1986 after an unsuccessful 3rd Season due to remaining low ratings.

Therefore this became the major transition season when USA tried to revive the show by having Stringfellow Hawke(Jan-Michael Vincent) getting replaced by his long lost MIA brother St. John Hawke(Barry Van-Dyke) after String gets hurt and Dominic Santini(Ernest Borgnine) dies off in a freak accident leading Dom's niece Jo Santini(Michelle Scarabelli) to take over Santini Air and when Archangel(Alex Cord)gets transferred overseas by his firm getting replaced by Anthony Sherwood as St. John's boss(Locke).

It's just too bad that this show went downhill when the original cast and crew of this show departed and got replaced by a new cast & crew, because this show really went down the toilet when St. John replaced String, especially since this show looked and seemed more like animation than realistic, unlike the first 3 seasons of Airwolf, although this season of Airwolf did have an interesting season premiere to it when they showed the transition of the cast & crew of Airwolf when String gets replaced by St. John after showing that String was seriously injured and too hurt to sustain his mission with Airwolf.",1226275200,8,1316,5.059907834101383

3657475,1,B001JAHPFI,"I waited until the price went down on Season 4 as there we're so many mixed reviews and comments to those reviews. I have bought DVD movies that some rated only 2 or 3 stars and loved them, whereas this set as of 5/2015 had about 3.5 stars, so point is you can't just go on ratings, sometimes you just take a chance, if the price is right, and it was when I purchased.  I am a die-hard fan of Airwolf, and not only watched the episodes when I was a teenager, but have watched them anew about 5 times since they we're released back in the mid 2000's. I loved the cast in Seasons 1-3, but I thought maybe it would be a fresh take with new characters.

I watched the first episode, and although there we're a few shots of Jan-Michael Vincent, they we're about the highlight of the entire episode, less the cheesy red Airwolf graphic when commercials we're obviously inserted when run on the USA Network in 1987.  I'll concentrate on 4 areas, video, sound, missions(episodes) and character acting.

Video: Now, I didn't watch it on an HD TV, I have one but its not hooked up to a DVD player, but I truly think it wouldn't have made a bit of difference, the pixel quality is excellent on the one I mainly watch, and man could you see about every pixel on many shots.  The video was horrendous, like most said, stock footage from Seasons 1-3 that was just put in, it didn't even match some of the missions.  The lair was like 1980's computer geek's dream with whole setup similar to another show that shouldn't have been cancelled, Street Hawk from 1985.  But, the lair was not consistent with the way it was after the end of Season 3, it was gawdy and way overdone, all of it so fake looking, just like the setup inside Airwolf itself.  Again I kept an open mind, but when you go to grainy screens of the episodes where the color looks too faded and washed out to where it looks way too bright, making some things look purplish, the shadows aren't right, and cut between the action scenes to what looked like live TV, back to washed out, grainy or too bright, then stock footage, which done right would have helped.  I can't even believe Donald Bellisario even produced this crap.  Also, along with the Airwolf writing on the screen in bright red was like add-on or something, along with the opening and closing credits and episode name.  Even the font they used for the lettering on-screen was awful, the high-tech images of the episode name, credits and such that we're used in previous episodes and most all of the action/dramas at the time we're much more cutting edge for the 80's.

Sound: When they are in Airwolf flying, you can hardly hear the character's voices or they are really muddled, and you hear nothing else in most scenes while in the chopper, its silent except for their baffled voices and the oddball who plays the character Archangel did in Seasons 1-3, come on the video link in Airwolf, always talking from inside the lair, that's an oddity right there, I used to love the ambient sounds in Airwolf, like some action shows in the 80's, you had way too much stuff making noise, beeping or lighting up, but it was still cool.  The live action sound isn't much better, sure the rockets and chainguns match the previous seasons, but for the most part they don't seem to jive exactly with what Airwolf is aiming at.  The music is ok, not the menacing undertones of a mission to be undertaken, and the action scenes are on par with the music, Sylvester LeVay did not do this season's music, so it wasn't quite up to standard as compared to previous seasons, but even as a stand-alone without previous seasons, it just didn't sound that great.  Kind of like an amateur kid with a synthesizer which we're all the rage during the 80's.

Missions/Episodes: To be honest, the missions and the objectives aren't all that bad, many we're quite intriguing and if it wasn't for poor sound and video quality, plus character acting, they would have made an excellent 4th season, I'm still trying to figure out why the original characters didn't want to continue, I've never Googled it, that's one question I don't know is if the show was cancelled due to poor ratings, I think in mid-1986 the 3rd season was still going on, but I'm not sure if it was Universal that pulled the plug, or the previous actors just didn't want to continue after Season 3, it wasn't their best based on the missions, 1 and 2 we're better, but I still can't imagine a show that was competing with at the time, Knight Rider, Miami Vice, and Magnum, P.I., couldn't hold its own.  All that said, the plots and storylines are kind of what held this up from getting a 0 out of 5, even thought you can't rate it less than a 1.  The 2nd episode, Escape, actually prevented me from trashing the set and taking a loss. The 1st episode where hands are changed I guess you could say, was the worst one by far. Stavograd, both parts, we're excellent as well and kind of reminded me of a similar episode in one of the previous seasons.

Characters: Oh man, they need help. Barry Van Dyke (St. John Hawke) is an excellent actor, and in the 28 years since Airwolf has done some great acting in TV and some film, but this was definitely not one of those shows that he should be remembered for.  Anthony Sherwood(The Company, formerly the Firm's agent Jason Locke) was almost humorous to watch his acting was so bad, it looked so fake and overdone.  And, what happened to the luxury office at the Firm(Company in this case), the limo, the helicopter (and plane), and the custom made clothes, suave look, and the personal assistant that his predecessor Archangel had in Seasons 1-3?  A cheap, plain, and compact Dodge/Plymouth K-car that he drove himself?  Really?  Geraint Wyn Davies(Major Mike Rivers) is just kind of a character you forget, why is he there?  3 people in the chopper now?  Normally, it was just String at the helm and Dom or Caitlin in the back being the navigator, monitoring different actions on the HUD, and selecting the weapons, etc.  Davies just sits in the co-pilot's chair, but seems to do nothing but wisecrack (which offers a bit of humor to the show), and then the show saver, Michele Scarabelli(Jo - Dom's niece).  She does some excellent acting in the missions, nothing else really needs to be said about her, I enjoyed her acting.  She seemed to be the brains and the beauty of the show itself.

Conclusion:  A really rotten show in so many ways, but the missions do have some appeal, its just too bad they we're carried out like B-movie or even a C-movie, if thats possible, as far as the sound, video and poor acting quality except for Scarabelli and some of the guest stars.  Where was a lot missing that gave the original Airwolf a well-rounded appearance.  How about String's cabin and warmth it brought to the show, they always seemed to all gather there at the end of an episode.  And, as I said above, all the perks the Archangel got, instead its just Sherwood and the high-teched out Lair.  I say where's the power lines coming in to power all that equipment and the lights. That's what the Lair was, a drummed down dark place with just a bit light, an alarm on the canyon wall, and that's about it.  Now, the Lair would not be too hard to spot.  I remember the scenes of Hawke and Dom driving in the snow in just the Jeep with no cover on it.  That show had character.  But, as I said many missions are interesting, they are just painful to watch because of the poor video and sound, so I guess you have to make up your own mind.  I definitely don't recommend it.  I know I wouldn't buy it again, knowing what I know now.",1433808000,3,7624,4.452192667145938

UNIVERSAL, if you're going to invest the money to find the tapes, make the transfers, and license the content, at least put the TINIEST EFFORT into cleaning up the print!!!

All other seasons were great!!

Just one Question......
Why did this fourth season happen???",1300492800,,152,5.08
3657516,4,B001JAHPFI,"Like many ""Airwolf"" fans, I considered for years the 1987 final season as a horribly cheap knock-off of the original 1984-86 CBS television series.  However, after having recently sampled a few free episodes online, I opted to take a chance on this package of 24 episodes, and, despite its flaws, I must say I'm pleasantly surprised.

When ""Airwolf"" went off the air in mid-1986, a fourth season based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada was quickly concocted in order to boost the series into a full syndication package (where 70-80+ total episodes were required at the time).  USA Network, in conjunction with Universal Studios, then aired this new ""Airwolf"" in January of 1987 through the end of the summer.  The last few minutes of Episode 24 (""Welcome to Paradise"") made absolutely no effort to create any sense of a series closure, so presumably a fifth season was at least possible.  While that obviously didn't happen, the fourth season at least proved that it could often match up with its far more expensive predecessor.

Kicking off the 4th season is the transition episode, ""Blackjack,"" where Jan-Michael Vincent makes a final appearance as surly master pilot, Stringfellow Hawke, who is soon seriously injured in a helicopter explosion that kills co-pilot Dominic Santini (no Ernest Borgnine here, just a quick cameo by a padded stand-in).  Meanwhile, String's long-lost brother, St. John (newly cast Barry Van Dyke), has been sending him secret messages from a prisoner camp in the Burmese Highlands, initially unaware that Col. Ray ""Blackjack"" Bouchard is scheming to use the captive Hawke to steal Airwolf by setting up a deadly trap.  Newly introduced are affable Major Mike Rivers (Geraint Wyn Davies), Dom's niece Jo (Michelle Scarabelli), and Archangel's replacement, Jason Locke (Anthony Sherwood), who quickly put the puzzle pieces together and rescue St. John rather easily.  This entertaining yet implausible installment is personally my season favorite, especially Vincent's poignant, final on-screen moments as Stringfellow Hawke leaving his character's ultimate fate as suitably ambiguous.

Among the show's numerous retroactive changes, you are supposed to believe that the now-departed Archangel (he's off somewhere in the Far East) apparently knew all along where deep-cover St. John really was while manipulating String  to control Airwolf for his own agenda.  All in all, once spelled out, this premise mostly works.  Still, it may be hard to swallow that, as sophisticated as Airwolf is purported to be and how only an experienced test pilot like Stringfellow Hawke could even fly her in the original series; this new quartet  instantaneously all can fly Airwolf with apparent ease.  Hence, I suppose a few trained chimps could also probably fly Airwolf now, too, with a little practice, but let's leave it as a loose plot contrivance.

New star Barry Van Dyke, though not the most naturally charismatic lead, is pretty solid with his Harrison Ford-esque persona as St. John.  Able and witty support comes from Geraint Wyn Davies as co-pilot Mike Rivers, while Michelle Scarabelli and Anthony Sherwood's efforts make this ""Airwolf"" far more a cohesive ensemble piece than it was simply as a star vehicle for Vincent and Borgnine.  As for the formulaic scripts, yes, they are often clichd and sometimes poor imitations of the original series, but, considering the program's obviously limited budget, they are still entertaining and are not as bad as you might think (at least, not all of them).  Also, yes, the new optical special effects (like Airwolf's cheapo laser beam) are beyond hokey.  Frankly, though, these amusing moments are at least worthy of some good chuckles.  On the plus side, in addition to the lush Canadian scenery, the recycled aerial shots of Airwolf are still terrific to see and help compensate for the show's deficiencies.

In the end, my only suggestion is to first preview ""Airwolf: Season 4"" online wherever you can find it before making an informed decision as a consumer.

Rating: 7.5/10 (After a quarter-century, this underrated version of ""Airwolf"" is finally ripe for re-discovery by a new generation).",1300233600,6,4170,5.228228228228228

Airwolf in its first 3 seasons was alright and worth the purchase despite the video quality not being what it is nowadays. Season 4 video quality in comparison is horrid at best and if someone suggested that Universal Home used a backroom stock boy to film from a video tape set to SLP shown on a cheap TV with a $40 video camera then transfer it to a cheap DVD in SLP mode I would have to believe it.

3657519,1,B001JAHPFI,"This Season 4 is total disgrace to Airwolf! The actors are awful and give very poor performances (except Barry Van Dyke). Geraint Wyn Davies and Anthony Sherwood totally do not deserved to be on this show!

3657520,4,B001JAHPFI,"Ah, the much maligned fourth season of the cult series Airwolf.  When CBS cancelled the series due to high production costs and low ratings(and possibly Jan Michael-Vincent's alcoholism)the show had a total of 58 episodes.  Not nearly enough for a successful syndication run.  So, following the example of other early-cancelled shows(The 80's Twilight Zone, 80's Alfred Hitchcock Presents) a new, cheaply made season would be filmed in Canada, specifically Vancouver.  These 24 episodes existed merely to bump up the total amount of episodes so Airwolf could be sold to more syndication markets. The belief was a series had to have more than 70 episodes to be aired on second run stations.
  The expensive original cast had to go, but Vincent came back for the first episode Blackjack.  Vancouver offered tax breaks that helped keep production cost down.  With the exception of Barry Van Dyke in the lead and the occasional guest star, all the other cast and crew were Canadian. The show was filmed on 35mm film and then transferred to videotape where all the post work was done.  This was a common technique in the 80'. Other shows like Star Trek The Next Generation(the first two seasons), Friday The 13th, The Series, etc were also filmed this way.  It does occasionally give the show a cheaper video-looking quality in comparison to the earlier seasons.
  Van Dyke is good in the lead, very much the squared jawed traditional hero.  Geraint Wyn Davies is the joker of the group but has some good dramatic moments too.  He seems to fly the copter more often than the Dyke.  Michele Scarabelli is cute and tough.  Much better than Jean Bruce Scott who was too annoying.  Anthony Sherwood is a fine replacement for Archangel.
  The other cast member not returning to this season was Airwolf itself.  The copter had been sold off already so season 4 is loaded with stock footage.  All 24 episodes were filmed in 6 months, a hectic schedule, and in what appeared to be the wettest year of Vancouver's history.
  Despite all the limited resources, stock footage, reduced budget, bad weather, this final season of Airwolf is actually not that bad.  Many of the stories are as good as the early seasons and there is a return to the international flair of the first season.  The copter stock footage is reasonably well incorporated and the new cast do their best to put on a good show.  Some of the guest stars are weak but all in all it just seems like everyone tried to make it work.
  It sure is nice to finally have this season on DVD.  Universal has done a great job cleaning up the print.  With the film-to-video conversion this was never the prettiest looking show, but the episodes actually look great here.  Colors are bright and sound is acceptable.  Squeezing five shows on one disc is pushing it though.  No extras sadly.  Each single sided disc comes in a thin plastic case that holds two discs and has a printed summary of each episodes.  Hilariously, some of the summaries are completely wrong!",1297382400,18,3004,4.755813953488372
3657521,3,B001JAHPFI,"Four years after Universal wrapped up with releasing the original CBS - AIRWOLF - on DVD they finally release the show's fourth and final season, an attempted reboot of the original series with an all-new cast, heavier stories, and a fraction of the original budget. Only Jan-Michael Vincent returns for the premiere episode, ""Blackjack"" to try and write-off the show's original concepts. First and foremost this revival is a total reinvention and bares no resemblence to the original series, short of video footage of the Airwolf helicopter, the show's retooled main theme song, and the actual title AIRWOLF. What's a shame is that because it has to follow such a great, high-budgeted, film-like series with a great cast, with none of the rest and a limited budget, it has an immediate mountain to climb for any viewer, whether casual or diehard fan. The show's 4th Season (1987) is actually not that bad, viewed by itself with an open-mind. I'm sure had this AIRWOLF existed before the other, the USA cable AIRWOLF would've been a hit with audiences as well. Unfortunately it came after-the-fact and late the game, when even the original series was starting to falter by it's 3rd Season (1985-86). Even within the season, mixed results surface. Episodes like ""Blackjack"", ""Deathtrain"", ""Code of Silence"", the ""Stavograd"" 2-part episode, ""Rogue Warrior"", ""Ground Zero"" & ""The Key"" all are great episodes within Season 4, and show tons of promise. But they are negated by rubbish like ""Windows"", ""A Piece of Cake"", ""X-Virus"", ""The Golden One"" & ""The Puppet Master"". Unfortunately the season just can't win in some of those levels. It can't be itself, or it's not being true to the original series. If it's true to the original series, than it's not good enough. It's just not fair.

For the most part the stories, 'the plots' at least, are somewhat of a improvement on Season 3, and some of Season 2 (1984-85) attempting to try and return the series to the foreign intrigue that dominated the show's 1st Season (1984) and was so popular. Some of it is returned, but in a new fashion than previously. A little bit more 80's. While Seasons 2 & 3 of the show had most stories centralized right here at home in America, Season 4's stories jettison the Airwolf crew across the world, althought not filmed there, stories fictionally take place in locales such as Burma, Turkey, Russia, the U.K., France, Afghanistan, and the Golden Triangle. It leaves the Airwolf feel a bit more satisfying, and several of the show's writers and directors went on to future successful dramas such as MacGYVER, FOREVER KNIGHT, DA VINCI'S INQUEST and 24.

The new cast is great, and have just as much chemistry together, instantly, as the original cast. Everyone plays off of each other terrifically, and the new dynamic of St. John Hawke (Barry Van Dyke) & Maj. Mike Rivers (Geraint Wyn Davies) is totally different from the String & Dominic of the original show, yet something still works about their buddy-relationship. Unfortunately the season spent so much time on Airwolf itself and the stories of the week, that the characters never really got to be developed beyond their basic roles, although it's pretty obvious the actors tried to break out of the mold when they could.

Like I said, it's not as bad as it's reputed to be. If you view it with an open mind, and understand the circumstances of the show's production, you might love it a little more than you did the first time around. For new comers, the change will be drastic. So try to educate yourself on what happened before viewing.

It's still a definite recommendation for any true AIRWOLF fan, if at least as a completist, and also possibly for FOREVER KNIGHT fans who can see a little bit of a young Geraint Wyn Davies doing the 'Nick Knight' thing on a high-profile TV series, several years before FOREVER KNIGHT kicked off in 1992.

3 out 5 stars - Fairly Good",1296604800,3,3908,4.809523809523809
3657522,4,B001JAHPFI,"If you search around for anything regarding season 4 of Airwolf, one thing is bound to come up again and again: that it was simply bad. Most of these reviewers either have not watched the whole season or have watched it with a preset mind-frame of someone who couldn't stomach the changes from the previous seasons and was not at all willing to give it a chance. Thus, all they find in it are faults. I'll try my best to be neutral and high-light both pros and cons of this season.

I admit, being a die-hard fan of Airwolf, it was really tough for me to go through this change. It was simply not well handled. But they had to get rid of the expensive cast; they could no longer be afforded. But the new cast wasn't bad as people make them out to be, there was no cheesy acting, at least not more than what you saw in season 2-3. If you got to complain about negative changes, start with addition of a certain whinny, annoying red-head; Caitlin. I'd much rather have Marella as a Co-Pilot than to stomach her, she was too much of a kid to be on Airwolf.

Barry's acting may not have been sublime, but it is bearable. Rest of the cast, however, did a good job. I am especially fond of Mike's character. He brought some charm to this season of Airwolf, in much the same way as Dom's character did in previous seasons; though they were both different. Jo Santini's character was a much more sober type, a lot better than Caitlin's; she easily fit into the world of Airwolf.

Now to the second major change: no real Airwolf to work with. It is correct, there was no real helicopter, and it was all either stock footage or model Airwolf, mostly footage. However, people, who are too much of die-hard fans of Airwolf, are quick to point out this flaw despite the fact that season 2 and season 3, especially, were thriving on these stock footages as well. For this reason, having no real chopper holds little to win that argument. The last season of Airwolf wasn't doing any better to make use of the real chopper. As for use of lame model Airwolf, I do believe that previous seasons had just as much of a lame model chopper as this season: I mean you could tell it was a fake. The only convicting small scale model was the one used in Pilot movie, but that has more to do with camera angles. So, not much reason to bash season 4 here as well. Other minor nitpicks are bad special fx. To be honest, there were 2 major special fx utilized throughout the series' run besides chopper itself, 1:  glowing missiles, 2nd: explosions. Admittedly explosions were less spectacular in this season, and the missiles did not glow this time: they seemed more colored or drawn on for lack of better term. The missile fx to be honest have always been lame in Airwolf, except for close-up shots no real loss there. Explosions could have used some more flare though; some loss there.

Now to the meat of things, things that really matter: the stories. It was a mix bag yet again. However, unlike the last 3rd season which produced only a handful of good episodes, around 4-6 out of 22, this season had more of those and what was better this time around was that they returned to the roots of season 1. This means that espionage stories were back, more or less, but it was an improvement on season 3, which was pathetically family friendly. Not saying season 4 didn't had any such stories, but majority wise this season fared better. One thing to keep in mind is that this season too did not brought closure to the series, much like any other series from that decade.

Concerning music of this season, it wasn't good but it wasn't bad either. It was definitely a change from the previous seasons, but it kept to the core of the Airwolf theme, meaning if it played somewhere you would recognize to what it belongs to. I would have preferred if they had kept it the same as it was before, but it wasn't a bother.

The DVD package is shamefully lacking as always, so not much to say about it.

So summing it all up, it has few cons: but those cons depending on your personal preferences can seem either too big to miss or too small to care about. I personally love Airwolf and I love entertainment, and I love stories. This is why I gave this season a chance. I too before watching this season was skeptical of it, many people warned me about it: but I watched it anyway and I found it was judged based on their personal bias. They gave reasons which held little weight to them, and some of them were self-contradictory based on my viewing of previous seasons.

If you like Airwolf, than go ahead watch it and try to enjoy it for what it is and not what it could have been. There is some new footage of Airwolf flying across different scenery, so you might find some enjoyment in that. In any case, all people really got a kick out of was watching that helicopter blow stuff up accompanied by that marvelous theme music.

To be honest, I find myself replaying season 1 more often than season 2-4. Airwolf officially died after season 1 ended, so not much to complain about season 4.

Technically I'd give this 3/5. But I gave 1 more just for the fun factor of watching that bird fly around.

If I had to be more critical, truly honest about Airwolf as a series, this would be my rating:

Season 1: 4.5/5
Season 2: 3.0
Season 3: 2.0
Season 4: 2.5",1296518400,6,5317,4.364004044489383
3657523,1,B001JAHPFI,"The ""fourth"" season of Airwolf is Airwolf in name only.  I don't think it can truly be called the fourth season because it is really just a reboot of the series after it was cancelled.  USA Network had the rebroadcast rights for the first three seasons of Airwolf.  Watching the reruns on USA is where I got hooked on Airwolf.

Then, for some reason, USA decided to tarnish the memory of the Airwolf series by creating the horrible ""fourth"" season.  I don't understand why they chose to kill off or otherwise dispose of all the original characters.  As evidenced by not seeing them on any other TV shows or movies at the time, I can't imagine that the orignal cast was all that busy.  If they wanted to continue the series, they should have gotten the original cast.  Maybe it was a matter of budget that prevented them from getting them for the show.  If this is the case, you get what you pay for.  Barry Van Dyke, son of Dick Van Dyke, is a terrible actor!  The rest of the ""season four"" cast was just as bad.

Stock footage was used over and over again.  Then there were the terribly fake looking shots with a model of Airwolf.  They even had Airwolf firing a ridiculous laser in USA's season four.  Bottomline is if you love Airwolf, don't spoil it for yourself by buying and watching this train wreck of a season by the USA Network.

3657528,2,B001JAHPFI,"It's about time they got this short-lived season of the new AIRWOLF series released on DVD, especially since Universal has already had AIRWOLFs first 3 seasons out on DVD since the Spring of 2007, despite the fact that this season wasn't as good as its predecessor since this season had no Stringfellow Hawke, no Dom (Ernest Borgnine), no Archangel(Alex Cord), & no Caitlyn O'Shannessy(Jean Bruce Scott) anymore in this revived series of this show after AIRWOLF was cancelled by CBS in the Spring of 1986, due to weak ratings.

Therefore, the USA Network decided to revive this series in the Winter of 1987 with the original cast & crew completley written out this abbreviated 4th Season with only Jan-Michael Vincent appearing in the 1st transitional episode for a last time when Dominic Santini(Ernest Borgnine) is killed off in an explosion & gets replaced by Michelle Scarabelli as Dom's niece(Jo Santini)who inherits Santini Air from Dom; the hard-nosed Michael Archangel(Alex Cord) was said to have suddenly been assigned overseas with the FIRM and got replaced by Agent Jason Locke(Anthony Sherwood)from a government agency called ""The Company"", but had no mention made about Caitlyn which was replaced by Air Force Major Mike Rivers(Geraint Wyn Davies).

Additionally, Hawke's long lost kid brother(St. John Hawke)who had been missing in action since Vietnam is suddenly revealed to be alive & well, having been working for many years under deep cover for American Intelligence & Locke's predecessor(Archangel) knew where St. John was the whole time and was just using the recluse Stringfellow to control Airwolf in the original series that ran on CBS from 1984 thru 1986.

St. John Hawke(Barry Van Dyke) was rescued & subsequently replaced his predecessor Stringfellow Hawke(Jan-Michael Vincent)to control Airwolf as the central character and production moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with a smaller budget that was less than 1/3 of the original CBS budget.

Therefore, the production crew no longer had access to the original Airwolf chopper, and all in-flight shots were recycled from earlier seasons; the original full-size studio mock-up was re-dressed & used for all interior shots leaving the new actors of this revived series little room to develop their characters along with the fact that this poorly revived version of AIRWOLF tanked after only 24 episodes leading to this shows cancellation in the Summer of 1987, not to mention this season doesn't even compare to the original 3 season series from CBS on top of that either.

In the meantime, Universal will be releasing AIRWOLFs Fourth Season on DVD Tuesday February 1st, 2011 for you AIRWOLF fans out there.",1288742400,32,2695,5.229166666666667

3657531,4,B001JAHPFI,"I have to disagree with the previous reviews that rate this season lower. First off, it is correct that new cast wasn't much of a welcomed transition, especially since the transition was not very well written. I myself hated it. However, that could be attributed to budgetary reasons, which should be obvious due to certain *flying* helicopter being absent from the show itself, minus the footage. But if one manages to put aside all that, the season itself is not bad enough to condemn it to the pits of Tartarus. The acting was pretty good and the cast had good enough chemistry. The stories were especially better than what we got in season 3.

This brings me to the main point of why I like season 4: it tried to take the show back to its roots which was to tell the stories of international espionage: not trying to using the helicopter to trim the lawn or save singers from certain death. Granted the season had its fair share of recycled stories or trash stories but in the overall scheme it outdid season 3, which for some strange reason was utilizing kids bit too often in almost every other episode. The characters were not getting any interesting towards the end of season 2 and in 3. Also, the show seemed to have gone under a visual change, the camera and lighting got dulled down in season 3, which wasn't the case with other seasons (including 4). My second point is how is using stock-footage in season 4 any different than it is in prior seasons? The show survived on stock-footage, especially after season 1. Most of the footage that appeared later in show, that was shot for one specific episode was either a let down or too short to make it worthwhile. In the end, it was pretty much stock-footage. So that reason automatically flies out the window to say that season 4 was bad. I missed String and Dom in season 4, but last time I checked the show was called ""Airwolf"", not Adventures of Hawke and Santini. My opinion is simply that season 4 hatred is unfounded and biased, and that people are not trying to enjoy it for what it is. I too hated the cast transition but it shouldn't let one from enjoying something that still has the Lady in it and that cool theme song.

Season 4 should be watched at least once for what its worth.",1272758400,4,2252,4.463592233009709
