8644999,4,B00ISDQHO4,"This drama has humor and human issues in a nice balance. THe main character Danda Rin is committed to her work as a labor standards inspector, so much so she will deviate from walking to work to warn a restaurateur or construction site manager of something amiss that her sharp eye caught. We find out she had issues with her past job. Her personality is unyielding in trying to do the right thing.

The cast is a lot of fun, and there is a backstory that threatens to erupt (and does by the end). There is plotting against Danda, and there are slowly, but surely, built loyalties with her coworkers, who at first find her utterly impossible to deal with, then little by little, see merit in her way of doing things, her courage in fighting for the worker against abuses.

i really enjoyed it.",1397433600,,793,4.462068965517242
