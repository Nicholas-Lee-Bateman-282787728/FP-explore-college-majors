8626433,5,B001DNQTFI,The footage is a little grainy but the show is so damn good! Well worth the purchase. Of my many Miles Davis dvds this is my only footage of him in 1971. Keith Jarrett adds two killer piano solo performances at the end just for good measure. Love it.,1408492800,,250,4.122448979591836
