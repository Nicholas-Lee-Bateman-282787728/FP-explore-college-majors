262114,4,6300216934,"Two years after the classic thriller JAWS struck terror into movie audiences around the world - and had many a beachgoer at least think twice before diving into the ocean -  another movie opened whose haunting music, classic cinematography and virtuoso performances gave the Peter Benchley/Steven Spielberg collaboration a run for its money.

Easily the best of all the movies that sought to cash in on the underwater monster craze that gripped the western world in the late 1970s, ORCA THE KILLER  WHALE is both fascinating, moving and also intriguing. The thrust of the movie is the battle between a determined fisherman (played by the always excellent Richard Harris with more than a tip of the hat to the literary Capt. Ahab) and an orca - a killer whale bent on revenge for the slaughter of his mate and murder of his offspring.

But, for me personally one of the best parts of the movie is provided by Charlotte Ramplings character Rachel's discussion on the scientific study of the fascinating creatures. Her `humanizing' of the whale is effective is invoking a certain level of sympathy for the creature and elevates the movie beyond JAWS in which (let's face it) the shark has little motive for actually attacking the residents of Amity.

Making her feature film debut as Annie is the incredibly beautiful and enchanting Bo Derek in what is probably her best performance (having reverted to soft porn in the 1980s with the likes of `Tarzan: The Ape Man' and `Bolero'). Her character meets a particularly gruesome end in this movie (leg cast and all) but then so do a number of the characters in this movie, until Harris' Capt. Nolan faces off with the orca on the frozen tundra in what will ultimately be a battle to the death.

I saw this movie many years ago on British television and it haunted me then, the direction by Michael Anderson is flawless and steady and Paramount Home Video have provided a good DVD transfer of the movie that is sadly devoid of any special features (not even a trailer). Still, if you liked JAWS the chances are you will like this movie - I did, and what better recommendation can I give than that.",1095379200,5,2139,4.705882352941177
262115,2,6300216934,"This movie has two scenes that will scar you for life (or at least linger in your memory).  Spoilers ahead.

First, we have a shot where a female orca spontaneously and very graphically aborts a bloody fetus all over the deck of a boat.  This event occurs after we have been told that a human fetus is very similar to a human fetus.  Ahh, the wonderful 70's- no PG-13 rating here, folks, even for a scene that would have been more appropriate in Caligula.  I was treated to this scene after school when I was about 8 years old in 1984.  And you thought seeing Bambie's mom get capped was traumatic!  I haven't figured out in the intervening twenty years whether the scene was supposed to be tragic or gross out!

The other moment is when the male orca, bent on revenge, bites off Bo Derek's entire leg, plaster cast and all.  We actually see Mr. Orca take the big chomp, after watching Bo slide slowly towards her doom.  For a low rent, cheesy rip-off flick, this is pretty heavy, albeit radically entertaining, stuff.

The rest of the movie is pretty forgettable with the occasional cool moment- lousy mat work effects, stomach churning narration, stilted dialogue, and patronizing heavy handedness.  What makes the movie truly bizarre is the lunacy of nearly every element of the story combined with the seriousness with which it is handled.  No one so much as smirks in this film.  Jaws had the sense to allow the audience to let its hair down every once in awhile.  Not here.

This is a strangely effective bad film, but it is probably too intense for the under 12 set.",1093046400,6,1573,4.544483985765124
262116,5,6300216934,"This movie is wonderful.  I have been watching it since the mid 80's everytime I could find it on a movie channel.  The movie does have a scary plot but the sub plot of love and devotion even between animals becomes so interesting, you forget to be startled by the scenes of Orca on the attack.  I urge everyone to see this movie, it is definitely a keeper.  I have searched for this movie for years to make it a part of my collection, how marvelous to find out it is now being released.",1091059200,3,487,4.148936170212766
262117,4,6300216934,"Much like Battlestar Galactica wouldn't have been made without Star Wars, Orca would not exist if it hadn't been for Jaws.  But that really doesn't matter.  The movie has its merits.  It has a great cast:  Richard Harris, Keenan Wynn, Charlotte Rampling, Will Sampson, Robert Carradine, Bo Derek (well, she looks good!).  Most importantly, it has Gorgeous cinematography and Ennio Morricone's haunting score.  What a great piece of music he created for this film.  There are very few creatures as amazing as the killer whale.  When you see them swimming and swooping magnificently about in the ocean to Morricone's music you will see what is so great about this movie.  I've loved it since I was a child and I'm glad that it's breathtaking visuals and sound will be given DVD-quality presentation.  It isn't the most original script to come along, but it's a beatiful film.",1088985600,9,873,4.917808219178082
262118,3,6300216934,"The angry mate of a slaughtered pregnant killer whale becomes so enraged, that he begins a reign of terror on a fishing village and their community. Even though this movie follows on the heels of Jaws, and while it's not golden filmmaking like the great white shark classic, it is better than you think and gives more creeps than you presumed. Also gives you a true impression that orca's are more intelligent than most whales or animals/mammals. Bo Derek, and Richard Harris give the film more than average acts, while poor Robert Carradine and others get whipped by the black sea wolf's tail or eaten by him. I vote Orca as a more dangerous and smarter animal than a killer shark-he's faster, smarter, and he's gota good reason to kill. The music, by Ennio Morricone is a little eerie and provokes your nerves that more terror is to come. So, although the film isn't a milestone, don't look at the poster of this movie and brush it off as a Jaws rip off. Better than it looks.",1061683200,60,978,4.531073446327683
262119,5,6300216934,"Orca is the greatest movie of all time. I'm sure most people say that their favorite movie is the greatest of all time, but they are all wrong. Orca is the greatest movie of all time.
Orca brings together some of the finest actors. Richard Harris, who unfortunately will be remembered for some trivial movie about a boy wizard and a throwaway musical about King Arthur, does his finest work in Orca. His portrayal of Captain Nolan, an emotionally torn fisherman coming to terms with the fact that marine animals have feelings, deserved the Oscar. Did he win? No, but that is not a strike against this fine film. Charlotte Rampling, who I'm sure is in other movies besides this one, brings texture to the marine biologist in love with a whale baby killer. The romance between the two is subtle. While most modern Hollywood movies would just throw in a gratuitous sex scene, Rampling accomplishes just as much with confused looks and having her shirt zipped down in one scene. Will Sampson, who is sadly better known for some movie about flying over a cuckoo's nest, also does a fantastic job of playing the Native American guy who says cryptic things and has ice fall on him. Robert Carradine, famous for Revenge of the Nerds, shows great range in not being around much and then being eaten by the whale. Bo Derek never equaled her success in this film elsewhere. I really believed her leg was bit off. She sold me.
The effects were great for the time. Many forget what special effects were like in those days, myself included because I was not born yet, but the point remains. The strange fisheye lens used to represent the whales point of view was genius. And I challenge everyone to find a more realistic looking whale fetus in a movie. You can't, you just can't. The dramatic fight between Captain Nolan and the whale could have easily become silly, but it doesn't. The Arctic Circle is accurately represented as a cold place with many icebergs, some of which whales can thwack themselves upon catapulting middle-aged Irishmen forty feet in the air. Keep in mind, also, this was done without the use of computer graphics. Steven Spielberg did not even put the shark in Jaws until over halfway through the film. Why? To hide a machine so fake I can only assume one of his children made it at camp. The mechanical killer whale in Orca is almost indistinguishable from the stock footage of killer whales continually played throughout the movie.
In 1977, how many directors were brave enough to shoot a killer whale jumping from one side of the boat, eating actor Robert Carradine, and landing on the other side? Just one, Michael Anderson. His bold choices along with screenwriters Luciano Vincenzoni and Sergio Donati (who both show an above average command of the English languages for native-born Italian speakers) make the film a statement not only about whale hunting and whale forgiveness seeking, but also about humanity. Charlotte Rampling's appeal to Nolan not to go fight the whale just because the whale wants revenge is not just about social protocols of how to make it up to the father of a whale baby you accidentally killed, but also an argument against the death penalty. Will Sampson's pointless death is an indictment of the senseless slaughter of tens of millions of Native Americans. Robert Carradine's tragic death in the film is social commentary on the probability of being eaten if you stand around on a boat being followed by a crazed killer whale. And probably also something about Vietnam, I assume.
Anderson even uses the orca itself to show complex emotions we normally associate with humans and not with unexplainably intelligent marine mammals out to kill fisherman. After destroying Nolan's house (presumably having used the phone book to find it and reading up on architecture and structural supports) and biting off Bo Derek's leg, the whale jumps for joy in the harbor as fires rage in the background. There is, however, a sadness, to the whale. It's as if he knows he can never have his family back no matter how hard he fights the forces that took them from him. Like Batman. Huh?
And while most in Hollywood choose not to admit it, many have ripped off Orca. The dead baby scene in Trainspotting is suspiciously reminiscent of the dead whale fetus scene in Orca. The creepy quasi-romance between an intelligent female and a somewhat crazy violent child murderer is directly stolen by George Lucas for Star Wars: Episode II. The use of icebergs is blatantly stolen by Titanic, and I have never heard James Cameron so much as thank Michael Anderson. And don't even get me started on Free Willy.
While Orca does not now get the respect it deserves, in time people will realize its genius. Just as people did not understand gravity or continental drift, in time they will come to recognize Orca as the greatest cinematic achievement of all time.",1060300800,9,4879,4.775147928994083
262120,5,6300216934,"...a misunderstood genius driven by the love in his gigantic whale heart? I am sure this film was produced and filmed in response to the success of Jaws in 1975, but don't let that stop you from viewing this truly great piece of cult cinema. Outstanding cinematography and wonderful performances, this isn't just some mindless under-sea thriller. Charlotte Rampling is so engaging and sexy as the scholarly voice of reason, and Richard Harris in particular shines in his role as the salty whale hunter who gradually finds empathy for Orca and mourns the day that he harpooned the killer whale's pregnant female mate. Also, look forward to some brief but important roles by the beautiful Bo Derek, Will Sampson (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Poltergeist 2) and let's not forget the whales themselves! However, the greatest performance of all comes from the stirring, evocative music of Ennio Morricone. This is some of his finest work and it is my opinion that this film would be completely forgotten without it. Orca has a vendetta and he won't stop until lives are lost and an entire fishing village is destroyed! The chilling ending (no pun intended) probably won't surprise the viewer, but I doubt there will be a dry eye in the house. This film should be on DVD! A must for any fan of forgotten cinema.",1059782400,7,1309,4.79646017699115

262226,4,6300216934,"I was honestly surprised. I expected a cheap Jaws knock-off akin to Barracuda, but this film can honestly go toe to toe with Jaws, and is NOT a knock-off aside from the general idea (big killer animal in the ocean hunted on a boat)

First of all, Richard Harris' performance blew me away. He poured so much heart and depth into his role as the Irish fisherman Captain Nolan, it was a top notch acting job that sucked me right into the film and refused to let me go. His lines are delivered in ways you can hear the thoughts and motivations, the past actions and regrets of his character with every syllable, a truly emotional role that makes you sympathize whole heartedly with the ""villain"".

That said, there is no true villain of this tail. Orca is a film all about the act of revenge and the feeling of grief, the Orca and Captain Nolan serve as two peas in a pod, mirrors of each other, and it does an amazing job at going into the mindset and morality of vengeance. I honestly was not expecting to get this level of depth (no pun intended) out of a killer animal movie.

The orca's special effects are incredible as well. PETA got involved because when they saw the animatronic being transported on a highway they thought it was a live orca. Live killer whales are used as well.
The only problem are the sound effects.. orcas screaming or roaring like dinosaurs is distracting, but I can understand the directing decision here.

The film is not without other flaws, though. There's a scene in the latter bit of the film where a character randomly decided to act out of character for one particularly jarring scene that is promptly dropped and forgotten about, as well as there being a constantly recycled green screen shot of the orca breaching shown over and over again to the point I would let out a chuckle by the 8th time and after.

I highly recommend this film.",1498780800,2,1873,4.480938416422287

Too often, we do kill the orcas and many other thinking feeling animals of the sea, and yet they never have responded in kind.  This movie was made in 1977 when there was no sense of political correctness, and more than anything this movie wouldn't have passed the PC test.  Besides that many of the sets are obviously models, and not well made at that.

If you feel inclined to watch this movie please bear in mind that these beautiful souls don't seek revenge on humans even though we are the senseless predators of the oceans. The movie might be fun for one watch, but it's very dated, and obviously Richard Harris was way beyond his prime and taking very low budget  B-movies like this one.

262544,5,6300216934,"This is another movie I have loved for as long as I can remember. And yes, my sympathies still lie with the Orca. Going away from the movie a minute, Orcas are called killer whales, however, they are not of any whale species. Orcas are actually of the dolphin species. I didn't know that for a long time, but it fits if you really look at them. Orcas do not really resemble whales, but they definitely have dolphin characteristics. Orcas do mate for life, knowing that makes this movie completely understandable and realistic in my opinion. It makes you see things from different perspectives, and that's what a movie like this should do. Is it a little dated? Perhaps, but I am content with it and very happy to finally have it in my collection.",1445385600,,746,4.533333333333333

The acting talents of Richard Harris, Bo Derek and Charlotte Rampling, and we cant forget the immortal Will Sampson as the indian philosopher. This movie was truly in the spirit of Jaws.

262789,5,6300216934,"After the immense success of ""JAWS"" in 1975 Hollywood wanted to cash in on the public's fascination with underwater creatures. The most successful of these films was 1977's ""ORCA"". Filmed entirely in beautiful Newfoundland, Canada the movie is quite different from ""JAW"". In ""ORCA"" the public roots for the killer whale whereas in ""JAWS"" the shark was the villin. Richard Harris plays the abbrasive and killer-crazing character in this outing where he shoots and captures the female mate of a killer whale. The whale then seeks revenge on the person who killed his mate.

 The story may sound a bit off, but the film is outstanding. The script is powerful and string with character you care for, especially the killer whale. The story is mainly about man vs. mammal and the ultimate outcome of that battle.

 Jacqueline Bisset co stars and this was Bo Derek's first film.

262831,3,6300216934,"The comparison is inevitable, but ""Orca"" is not much like Jaws.  Jaws was about the horror of having an unthinking beast around who only sees you as dinner;  Orca is about an emotional struggle between a human and a THINKING beast.  It's hard to know who to root for at times--the orca, who has been wronged but is now being a jerk, or the human, who wronged the orca but is now slowly realizing what he did and regretting it.

(Sidenote:  orcas do NOT mate for life (they have one night stands), but if you pretend that the dead female orca was Orca's sister or mother, the movie still works.)

This movie is more like a Greek tragedy than a horror movie.  I gave it three stars because some of the special effects are kind of awful.",1416528000,,734,4.313868613138686

A man wipes out an orca whale's family. The orca decides to bedevil the man endlessly. Credit must be given to the director and writer for having the protagonist as an easy-going and nonsuperstitious man who feels genuine remorse for what he inadvertently did. The performance sells the whole movie. The ham-fisted attempts to make orcas seem super smart and super strong were silly as all get-out. The ending is very satisfying.

262921,4,6300216934,"I can't say that this film was a rip off of the movie Jaws, but on some level it was Jaws inspired. Basically the over all story is about a male killer whale who looses his family (mate and child) to a fisherman. The whale seeks revenge on this same man, and ruins the fisherman's life. The man can takes no more, and sets off to kill the whale. The movie has its good points, but it can run a little long at times. In the film Jaws the shark was the villain, and made the audience cringe. By the end most audience members were glade to see the shark blown up...also Jaws killed for food. However, in Orca the whale is not the bad guy, in fact, the audience is suppose to feel bad for him. In the beginning it's the fisherman who is the villain, and Orca the victim. However, by the end of the film, there really is no bad guy, but one of them does die. Also, in Orca the whale kills for revenge, and not for food.
SPOILER ALERT
This movie is more of a drama, then a horror movie. Jaws was horror, Orca is more intense drama. There is some blood, and a couple s-x scenes.
Probably the most disturbing scene is when Orca's partner is lifted onto the boat (SPOILER ALERT), AND her un-born baby pops out of her body. The crew of the ship wash it over board with a hose, as Orca watches helplessly. Personally, I felt this was a little tacky. It would have been enough to have his mate hoisted onto the fishing boat, without the baby falling from her, but that is just my opinion...I'm sure for other viewers it worked for them.

The main human character injures a pregnant female Orca while trying to capture one, and she ends up dead. The male Orca, her partner, is hell-bent on revenge, and stalks the coastal waters surrounding the town where the would-be whale catcher lives. The residents become increasingly angered by the captain's refusal to fight the whale, therefore allowing it to leave their boats and their town alone. Think Moby Dick except with an Orca.

the Male Mate goes on a rampage, driving the fish away and...i'm not even kidding, blowing up the power-station for the town!!

263072,4,6300216934,"""Orca"" is an interesting movie about a killer whale who is fed up with that mean old river fool Mr. Harris killing his mate and going after other sea life. This movie is far more entertaining than ""Jaws"", and it is also more thoughtful--there is the suggestion that whales have primacy on a par with human consciousness, and it's not just a simple minded action movie like ""Piranha."" The DVD really could have used an audio commentary and some extras--I know it's hard work guys, but geez--but otherwise the picture and audio quality is very good, with a widescreen transfer that will look terrific on a widescreen television. And yes, Bo Derek gets her leg bitten off--big deal. I only wish this one would have been available earlier. Whereas Spielberg's film is so cynical that it cannot think about anything other than how to manipulate the emotions of the viewers, ""Orca"" asks the braver questions and takes its time. It may not be considered a classic, but it probably just needs more time.",1389312000,,995,4.757225433526012

The difference is that this story can remind you a little of Moby Dick without having to read a really long book while getting that 1970s vibe. If you're buying this for Bo Derek's name she's more of a secondary character as this the story focuses more on the captain and the whale. The whale does prove to be very smart while the captain becomes very fatalistic as the movie progresses. My advice would be to not pay too much for the movie or else you might feel robbed especially with the way the movie ends.,1389139200,2,719,4.333333333333333

263105,5,6300216934,"I just watched this movie as a nostalgic impulse after one too many reboots of the same 'ol trash and I have to admit, I now understand why Hollywood has virtually given up on putting out action/adventure/suspense/horror thrillers that are based on some powerful message. Too many people have compared this film to ""Jaws"" to conclude its message served any purpose towards its economic potential. Even pro-whale documentaries like ""black-fish"" made reference to the movie as some action meaningless thriller that portrays Killer Whales as vicious killers. If I were investing in the creation of a movie I'd be frustrated as I'd have no choice to sell out to the masses desire for a meaningless forgettable joyride as opposed to something that reminds them how evil humanity can be.
All that aside, more effort could've been given for its direction, which was no wear near the caliber of the meaning behind it. I would've docked 1/10 of a star for that, but since the option isn't available, the average of 5 will do.
By no means am I implying that this is better or worse than Jaws in the overall sense. I happened to enjoy that other more popular film. However, aside from both of them sharing the topic of ""man vs animal"" clich, I find nothing else to compare them both with. This movie is composed of too many dimensions for a fair comparison, as it can be argued it's man vs nature, man vs man, and even evil vs evil, offering enough character development where an attentive audience member can find him/herself at a position where it's impossible to take sides.",1388448000,,1566,4.73992673992674

As the movie progressed, I began to suspect that this PARTICULAR whale was less interested in forecasting the direction of securities and mutual funds and more interested in engaging in rather boorish conduct amid his fellow sea-goers, and in squandering his one opportunity for inappropriate physical contact with Bo Derek. You're not supposed to EAT her leg, ya big dummy! Even a dumb dog knows THAT, and you're supposed to be their intellectual superior???

This is an incredible adventure/dramatic film that works because of the acting of Richard Harris as Captain Nolan, the tragic man who kills a female killer whale and her calf.  He seeks solace and assistance but is drawn into a battle to the death by the vengeful male killer whale.  The supporting cast of Charlotte rampling, Will Sampson, Keenan Wynn, Robert Carradine and Bo Derek helps bring this moral mythical tale to the screen with much emotion under the direction of Michael Anderson. Anderson also has a wonderful and touching script from Luciano Vincenzoni and Sergio Donati who emote compassion for the animals who are ruthlessly hunted and make a strong statement about penance, forgiveness forgiveness, seeking inner peace, revenge and humanity.

  Light popcorn entertainment if there's, truly, nothing else on.
I'm not jaded by the advances that have been made in film-making. There are many older films that hold up well and are superior to a lot of what is produced today. This movie's not one of them.
  My world began to shimmer at the opening credits with the super-imposed juxtaposed twin orca shots. It came crashing down when the little rubber shark flew out of the water when the orca attacked it. Having the shark ""growl"" didn't help much, either.

263277,4,6300216934,"This film has often been regarded as a Dino De Laurentis attempt at cashing in on the coat-tails of Spielbergs Jaws.  It's actually, much more closer to Moby Dick that Jaws.  While backgound motivation to create this flim may have steered it this way, Orca is an entirely differnt film than Jaws.  The photography is captivating, the musical score is emotional and somewhat haunting (in a much more surreal way than the Jihn Williams two-note Jaws anthem (regardless of how well that worked).  I really like the educational aspect to the film, the believable characters.  I actually would have given this 3 1/2 stars, for some very sloppy editing. 1.) The film goes out of its way in the early scenes to teach the audience how to distinguish a male or female killer whale based on its dorsal fin- yet there are scenes shown in which the antagonist Orca (a male) is clearly a female (probably due to the trained animals the producers had available). 2.) The biggest plot hole is that this animal calmly and cooly watches his mate get captured and terminally injured, but does nothing at the time, yet later he demonstrates the ability to sink boats with a single head butt, ultimately forcing Richard Harris as the 'Captain Ahab' stand-in to confrintation on the open icy sea.  One would think that the Orca would sink Harris' boat at the onset and attempt to save his mate....but then we wouldn't have a movie, and honestly- you don't think about this the first time you watch it.  I really enjoyed Orca, and it's one of those movies I watch over again.",1300233600,,1553,4.666666666666667

263279,5,6300216934,"The first thing I usually see written about this movie is, its a Jaws rip off. Anyone who says that, can't have actually seen this movie or at the very least, understood it.

Jaws was about a group of men hunting down a killer man-eating shark. The shark had no emotional goal other than to keep from getting hunger pains. When he came after the men, he was coming after them to eat them for food, not vengeance. All the vengeance stuff came in the sequels. But for Jaws alone, it was just a bottomless pit with teeth. Jaws was the villain. In the end, Jaws was a FUN movie to watch.  You were happy at the end that Brody blew it up. Happy he survived.

Orca on the other hand is about man's greed and the lives it affects. You have a man who decides, its good money to catch a whale and sell it. But he catches a pregnant female. I was only about 8 when I saw this movie. I saw Jaws before it and I liked monster movies, I figured this would be the same. However, watching the mother whale miscarry, her fetal calf hitting the deck with all the blood and the screaming, I know then...this movie was f'ed up. But I watched it through anyways. Found out quickly, the orca wasn't the villain in this picture. He didn't want to eat anyone. He just wanted a life for a life. And so the rest of the movie is spent watching the orca try to get Harris. And in the end, when he does, you aren't cheering like you were in Jaws. Its bittersweet. The killer of his mate and calf is dead, but he's alone still.

So when someone says this is a Jaws rip off...they have about the brain capacity of Jaws himself. This was more a Jaws cash in. It after all did come out on the tail of Jaws, certainly. It was trying to cash in on Jaws' success. But IMO, Orca was a superior story because it made the orca a character, rather than a tool. You understood his pain and hatred. Where as Jaws, just bit a lot.

Also something else should be noted here, that is often underrated about Orca...the music. Haunting, gorgeous. The theme is just amazing.

Was this some award winning blockbuster? No, but it was a beautiful movie that deserves a look.",1264204800,6,2124,4.2063882063882065

263282,3,6300216934,"Maybe its because i didn't go into expecting cinematic greatness a la jaws, but this movie isn't terrible. the acting is not really that cheesy at all....its more the premise of the film, and the effects behind it. the minatures look like minatures, and for some reason 'orca' likes to jump playfully amidst the trouble he causes in a sort of 'ha ha i got you!' type fashion, which obviously detracts from the drama the filmakers were trying to acheive.

ennio marricone's (spelled wrong probably) score is great, slightly repetative as much of his music is, but fantastic nonetheless.

i rather enjoyed richard harris' performance. though the killer whale expert lady is annoying, as she lectures him the entire movie on the whale and what it can do and what its thinking...only to claim she cant help him and has no idea what the whale is capable of when the time comes to go out and get it.

i would say don't compare it to jaws...but seeing has how there are constant stabs against great white sharks and one is killed in a rather silly (and unlikely) way in the begging, its funny to think the filmakers considered this a viable alternative. still enjoyable though. and good for a laugh or two.

Yes, it's a bit far-fetched making a whale almost human-like but most revenge films are satisfying so the filmmakers figured, what the heck, let's cash in on the popular theme. It's also the decade of ""Jaws,"" so I guess man-eating sea creatures were ""in."" This movie is nowhere near the caliber of Jaws, but it is still attention-grabbing.

Richard Harris and Charlotte Rampling star, but a young Bo Derek is here, too, in a supporting role. Now, that's attention-getting!",1238457600,,659,4.927927927927928
263316,4,6300216934,"It is indeed unfortunate that this movie was caught up in the wave of what was Jaws mania -

No doubt this is one of Richard Harris's finest performances.  More than what is dialogue is unspoken dialogue.  Human insolence toward animals of all manner is neatly wrapped up and directed toward yet another species.

Along the way even mankind's density is impaled by the obvious and great grief of the Whale's mate -",1224720000,,414,4.63013698630137
263317,3,6300216934,"Richard Harris tries his hand as whaling, but manages to attain an arch nemesis in the form of a killer whale, when the whale's mate and baby die at Harris' hand(or propeller as it were).  Orca spends a good deal of the film trying to lure Harris into a duel to the death while Harris sulks and mopes about what he has done.  The infamous(but not terribly impressive) scene where Orca chomps of Bo Derek's leg(can't say I blame him.  I'd like to chomp off Bo Derek's leg too) is enough to put Harris into full Captain Ahab mode, and he sets out do battle with Orca and finds himself having a whale of a time.
On the books, Orca's not considered to be the best of movies.  I can see why.  Sure, I don't think it's terrible, but I won't find myself watching it much voluntarily.  Like the whale in Free Willy(only more pissed off), the attempt here is to make the whale more of a real character in the film rather than a mindless killing machine.  It's kinda corny, but I suppose it works to a certain degree.  You do feel kinda bad when the mate and baby die.  But at the same time, you don't really want Harris to turn up as whale food either.  The high intelligence of the killer whale is a point shoved in our faces throughout most of the film, but I find it rather hard to believe the whale is smart enough to do some of the things he does.  How does a whale know exactly where on the pier to ram his head in order to bust the gas lines and blow up the dock?  Was he reading the blueprints or something?
Harris is good, though the rest of the cast is pretty much cardboard.  Good ol' Will Sampson is wasted in a small role where he can sprinkle tidbits of Native American mysticism.
Orca's rather harmless, but for Jaws ripoffs I still go for Tentacles.  Though it may be a worse film, it's more fun to me.",1223856000,3,1809,4.175792507204611

263319,5,6300216934,"In 1846, J. Richardson & J.E. Gray coined the generic term ""killer whale"" for the species of whale we know as Orca. Sailors used to refer to them as ""whale killers"" because they often witnessed the Orca attacking other large cetaceans.

But in this movie, you won't find any of that going on. Oh no. Our friend has developed a distinct taste for human flesh, not to consume but to maim. This movie is all about pure vengeance, and after it's all said and done, it feels good, both for the whale and viewer. In fact, the resolution of the story completes the viewer.

I know this comment may irritate certain people but for a supposed copy cat of Jaws, I feel this film exceeds what Spielberg attempted to do with his shark film. There's a profound emotional current which drives the story forward, which was lacking in Jaws.

When I watched the film, I almost felt as if the sirens themselves were using the Orca as a medium to communicate their song of death and destruction to the fishermen.

It really is a first-rate story and one that should not be missed.

The DVD is lacking in extras and even a trailer, unfortunately. There's noticeable grain throughout the movie which shows restoration wasn't a high priority when they encoded this film. At least it's widescreen, though. Don't get me wrong; I don't want you to think it a terrible print because it's not. I just feel they could've done a better job.

Unfortunately for Nolan, he captures and inadvertently kills a pregnant female orca whose mate, the orca of the title, decides (?) to enact revenge on Nolan.

The Orca maims Bo Derek's character in a spectacular scene in which he destroys a house and sets nearly half the town ablaze.  Ironically, this film is probably the only one where Derek keeps her clothes on.  Charlotte Rampling plays a scientist, but she's not given much to work with here.

263377,5,6300216934,"If you can't appreciate how awesome and hilarious this movie is, then you have no sense of humor whatsoever. I feel that strongly about ""Orca"".

From the very first scene, this Dino DeLaurentiis classic will flatten you with its authentic 70s drama, awesome cast, and the unintentional comedy that makes so many films ripen with age. We first meet marine biologist and college professor Charlotte Rampling in a classroom, where she describes the complex communication of orcas and then says that to an orca, the speech of humans would be considered ""retarded."" Cut to scenes of orcas frolicking.

This sets the stage for the ghastly, over-the-top atrocity perpetrated by the crew of the Bumpo: arguably the awesomest scene in the entire film. Captain Nolan (Richard Harris) decides to catch him an Orca to sell to an aquarium. Oops, his incompetent crew screwed it up. As a female orca writhes from the ship's crane, mortally wounded, its mate freaks out like an overwrought player on a daytime soap opera. Things reach their peak when a malformed, dead fetus orca spews from the dying female. The male orca cries out in pain and anguish in an exact facimile of the most cliched line in cinema: ""Nooooooooooooooo!"" Then he takes a picture of Captain Nolan with his eye, and from that point forward we're only counting the days until the Captain goes down.

Like so many other classics of this nature, the supporting cast brings a key element to the table. No sooner has Nolan discovered the dead body of the orca he killed deposited in his harbor, than Chief from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest appears, dispensing empty 'Native wisdom' along the lines of ""The elders of my tribe say, when an orca washes up on your beach, it means that Mother Earth is mad at you"". The gorgeous Bo Derek is the eye candy of the film, until she either does or does not get chomped (I'm trying not to give too much away here). The vengeful orca himself has a lot of personality. After a spirited round of destroying houses on stilts and somehow setting them aflame, the orca does joyous flips in the air.

Ultimately, all the characters end up on a suicide mission that seemingly leads them towards the North Pole. On this mission, a basic Hollywood rule applies: if you start talking about turning back, the Orca is coming for you next! Captain Nolan pleads with the orca to feel empathy for him, since his family was killed by a drunk driver, but the orca isn't having any of it. Their showdown amidst ice floes is epic, as is the melodramatic tune that rolls over the closing credits.

Embrace all that is Orca. One of the best movies out there.",1141344000,10,2631,4.661637931034483

You may side with the whale since Harris' character is not that likeable.  Charlotte Rampling is fine as the marine biologist who warns Harris not to mess with the whales; Will Sampson is a Native American fisherman who joins the quest; Bo Derek made her film debut as the young girl/crew member who gets a close up meeting with the whale; and Keenan Wynn, Robert Carradine and Peter Hooten fill out the cast.

263382,3,6300216934,"Wow, it amazes me how many glowing reviews this film is getting here at Amazon.com...which I'm venturing to guess are probably the ONLY glowing reviews it's ever gotten in the years since its release.  This movie, of course, is the illegitimate offspring of a movie that spawned legions of illegitimate offspring - Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"", of course.  And with the exception of Sir Steven's shark tale, killer-sea-creature movies often tread that fine line between between Grade-A cheese and being Grade-F rubbish best used as a drink coaster (even the exponentially-wretched ""Jaws"" sequels).  Fortunately, in his insatiable quest to try and top ""Jaws"" at the box office - which, judging by his ""King Kong"" remake, ""The White Buffalo"", and this movie, at least kept him working - producer Dino DeLaurentiis managed to get enough sincerity imbued into this film that it does get some distance from the likes of, say, ""Jaws: The Revenge"" - even if it's not much of a distance.

The bare-bones premise, of course, is standard for these killer-sea-creature flicks - sea creature attacks people - but the screenwriters manage to wrap an interesting, if not necessarily scientifically-accurate, concept around it.  Richard Harris plays the Robert Shaw wannabe Nolan, who, along with the crew of the fishing vessel Bumpo, are in the middle of sharkin' when they run across lovely Charlotte Rampling in the obligatory role of the brainiac who tries to convince the shark hunter that sea creatures are people, too.  This, of course, is interrupted when Rampling's gawky sidekick, future Tri-Lamb Robert Carradine, falls out of the boat and is ten seconds away from becoming Shark Snausages when BLAMMO!  The 25-foot-long Great White Shark (comprised of stock footage, a fakey fin and an obvious juvenile slam at ""Jaws"" - 'My sea monster's better than your sea monster, nyah nyah!') gets rammed clean out of the water in a bloody death-froth by Our Hero...and I don't mean Nolan.

Yes, in a surprisingly inventive twist on the genre, the monster is the sympathetic character of the piece. And of course, it becomes clear early on that Our Hero is going to be gnoshing on some human eye candy as the story progresses into a profit-minded attempt by the crew of the Bumpo to capture Our Hero that results in a nick in his dorsal fin and the unnerving skewering of Our Hero's Mate.  This scene is followed up by some wonderfully gory shots of attempted orca suicide by Our Hero's Mate and - here's one for the kids! - a WHALE ABORTION.  Yeah, you read that right. Forgive the spoiling, but as an afficionado of bad-yet-strangely-amusing movies, I feel it is my obligation as a viewer to inform the public.  As if you wouldn't be able to tell this movie was made in the late '70s as it were.

What follows, naturally, is whale vengeance of the highest cheese order as one by one, the crew of the Bumpo are given an exceptionally close look at Our Hero's pearly whites, accompanied by further cameo appearances by Charlotte Rampling as she attempts to exude sex appeal while delivering Star Trek-level exposition with that smoky voice of hers and utter grievances about orcas' capacity for vengeance (which I was taught was a distinctly human trait...oh well, that's thirteen years of basic learning down the drain).

Then there's poor Will Sampson, stuck in the token role of the wise old Indian yet again, spinning yarns about whale-gods of vengeance or some such nonsense that's intended primarily to spook Nolan into getting off his drunken butt and going out to face Our Hero before he sinks an entire fleet of fishing boats and scares away all the fish that the villagers are dependent on for their livelihood (one of the funniest developments in the movie has all the townsfolk in Nolan's seaside digs pitching together to repair his boat, all for the express purpose of getting him out of their faces).

The rest of the cast gives largely unconvincing yet wonderfully hammy performances - which, given how obvious it is early on that most of them become Purina Orca Chow, can be easily excused.  Among the condemned are Keenan Wynn (who also appeared in another great ""Jaws"" knockoff, ""Pirahna"") and, for some reason, Bo Derek, who contributes absolutely nothing productive to the movie or to the development of the plot and the other characters (this before ""10"" hit theaters).

Still, despite itself, ""Orca"" has some genuine entertainment value.  At the very least, it does have more heart than any killer-sea-creature movie out there (in fact, I daresay it's comparable to that of ""Jaws"") and you actually feel for Our Hero, even as he's chewing up yet another dummy stand-in.  Our Hero is brought to life using the standard effects for their time: live footage combined with the occasional 'aquamatronic' orca for shots involving the actors.  Fortunately, like Bruce the Shark in ""Jaws"", the faux orca never appears on screen long enough to make its phoniness stand out too much.

The bottom line: ""Orca"" is not what I call a film for all to enjoy, yet it has its moments.  If you're in the mood for something cheesy, check it out.",1123372800,5,5130,4.887096774193548

The irony that, when this movie was made, humans didn't know much about orcas, yet we now know that the way this orca must have FELT is probably realistic. I think Nolan realizes that this is not just some dumb creature and that wanting to capture it and take away it's freedom and family was the biggest mistake of his life.

Made in 1977 and starring the legendary Richard Harris and Bo Derek in her film debut,this is one well made suspenseful revenge trip.

263427,1,6300216934,"First of all, I should say that although I cannot bring myself to give this film more than 1 star, I'm certainly not saying that you shouldn't see it.  I, for one, have seen this film 4 times, and don't doubt that I will view it again at some point.  It is immensely amusing, and it is also THE STUPIDEST FILM EVER MADE.  Normally I give things that are so bad that they're entertaining a high rating, but 'Orca' is just to terrible for me to do that.

Lots of Orca apologists will try and tell you that this isn't a complete Jaws rip-off because the Orca is the protagonist.  Whether or not this is a valid defense of the film (which, for the record, it isn't), this points to the central flaw- This is an unspeakably moronic premise.  I gotta tell ya, I don't find Killer Whales to be all that lovable, and the film does little to change this feeling. Beyond this, the main way it seems to try and generate sympathy for the whale is by showing it jumping out of the water again and again and again.  This tactic is almost completely unsuccessful, I'm sorry to say.  They also like to show closeups of his eye, where he is apparently crying. Do whales have tear ducts? Dunno, though I doubt the filmmakers know either.  Furthermore the film takes great pains to make us believe that Orcas are hyper-intelligent, psychic super-animals.(Evinced by the best line in the film, where we are informed that a recording of Orca 'speech' has over 20 million pieces of information in it, whereas the bible only has 4 million. I suspect they may have taken liberties with the facts, in that case.) This again presents an unsympathetic picture, as if I would advocate the worldwide destruction of the orca, if I believed that the real animal was at all reminiscent of the ones described in the film. This is all compounded by the fact that the Whale doesn't even have that good of a case- Nolan didn't kill his mate, she killed herself.  Yeah, Nolan shot her with the harpoon, a veritable pinprick, but she's the one who rammed her damn head into the propeller for no apparent reason.  Furthermore, the fetus scene, which is oft-described as 'horrifying' or 'disturbing', tends towards the baffling and humorous regions.(first the former, than the latter)  Finally, for all the films flaws, I actually kinda like Nolan, and certainly like him a helluva lot more than some stupid whale.

'Orca' is technically incompetent, a fine match to go alone with it's dramatic absurdity.  On the good points, there's some decent cinematography from time to time, but this isn't all that impressive, as the ocean is naturally beautiful.  Just point the camera at it and you'll do fine.  Also, Morricone's score is fairly pretty, though it is ridiculously romantic much of the time, thus heightening the already spectacularly bathetic tone of the film.  Harris is kinda a caricature, but I kinda like him.  The rest of the acting is crap.  Rampling plays a mannequin which is also apparently supposed to be whale scientist.  Initially she hates Nolan with a passion that burns with the heat of a thousand suns, but she eventually decides that she loves him, because if she didn't there wouldn't be a tacked-on and under developed romantic subplot.  Bo Derek plays the girl with blonde hair and broken leg, and spends most of the film with a glazed, uncomprehending look on her face.(This is true of Rampling's character as well, but Rampling's blank look is somehow more calculating in nature.)  Than we've got Ralph Sampson as the mysterious Indian dude, who proves to be a better actor when he isn't saying anything.  The very worst performance in the film would have to on the part of the large foam blocks which are apparently supposed to be ice, which are featured prominently in the climax.  Continuity is a big problem, as the whale's chipped fin appears and disappears sporadically, and the indoor pool they use to simulate the ocean for the Orca's stirring closeups is less than convincing, as the water in it is green.  As others have mentioned, the real Orca they use frequently has a drooping fin, which signifies that it is a female.  This is particularly amusing, as I might not have noticed this, except for that a character actually mentions how female orcas have drooping fins.  It's nice when I film points out it's continuity problems for you, or perhaps the lead Orca is just a hermaphrodite.

It's hard to say which aspect of this film is the stupidest.  The Orca's mad rampage, where he swims into town and smashes of the docks, thereby causing a massive fire is a standout moment.  His various Shamoo-esque leaps, poorly superimposed over the burning town are quite literally beyond belief the first time you view them.  The killing of the shark is quite spectacular as well, as the shark appears to go through a number of transformations prior to the killing, where it then turns into an incredibly stiff shark model, and then turns back into a real shark which is flying through the air, somehow.  It's death throes are great too, as we are shown documentary footage of a great white which is quite obviously perfectly healthy, but with sad squeals overdubbed in order to suggest that it's dying.  (This last is particularly great, as I've watched enough shark documentaries to know that Great Whites really don't make any noise at all.)  Also, towards the end of the film the Orca leaps up onto an iceberg, thereby tipping it up at an angle and forcing it's prey to slide down towards him.  Years later, Futurama used this idea, but they thought it was funny and ridiculous, rather than dramatic or horrifying, for some reason.  However, the absolute best part might have to be when the Orca actually pushes an iceberg into Nolan's boat.  Apparently icebergs aren't nearly as big and heavy as I'd been led to believe.

Yep, stupidest movie ever, right here.  Check it out.",1106265600,10,5874,4.704789833822092
263428,5,6300216934,"It's better than Jaws in the sense of the deep message of this very powerful film.  Yes, it's a mammal like the shark in Jaws.  Yes, it kills like the shark in Jaws.  People want to kill it, like the shark in Jaws.  However, the big difference is that here, unlike Jaws, the one who seeks justice is not the human being, but the mammal.  In Jaws the man seeks revenge over so much murder the shark is causing.  In Orca is the mammal who's seeking revenge for the same reason.  Unlike Orca, it's easier to get the point in Jaws.  It's easier to understand humans when we're the victims, but it's harder to understand mammals when they're the ones suffering for our ambitious deeds, and that's the power of this film.

The music is magnificent, marvelous.  The acting is extraordinary.  I think it's the best performance by Richard Harris from all the movies I've seen of him.  I saw Orca when I was around 13 and I cried througout the whole film when i saw it.  I still cry when i see it, especially during that scene where the male orca pushes his already dead female mate to the shores followed by his fellow orcas.  You can hear them crying all along.  The ending is crucial, breathtaking.  This movie is powerful and it leaves you with the message of not messing up with nature.  I loved it.",1103673600,7,1294,4.369747899159663
263429,5,6300216934,"Yeah, I know, ""Orca"" is sort of a ""Jaws"" rip-off (coming out in 1977, two years later); I admit it may not technically be as good as ""Jaws"" but I personally consider it on a par with that more popular pic. Actually, despite the obvious similarities, ""Orca"" has a very different vibe than ""Jaws.""

THE STORY: Richard Harris stars as a New Foundland fisherman trying to make some big money by capturing a killer whale for Seaworld (or some such park). Unfortunately he ends up horribly botching the job -- killing a female killer whale AND her poor unborn calf. The rest of the film involves Orca's vengeful wrath on Harris and the seaport community where he lives.

WHAT WORKS: First of all, the story is utterly serious in tone -- there's no camp to be seen; secondly, the score by Ennio Morricone (""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"") is equal-parts beautiful, touching and haunting; thirdly, the casting is great: Harris is perfect as the aging sea salt, Charlotte Rampling is super sharp & intellectual as the cetacean biologist, Will Sampson (""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"") is great (and cliched) as the Indian sage with his wise, foreboding words and Bo Derek is, well, you know.

In addition, the New Foundland locations are fabulous and, at an hour and a half, the film is short and sweet (as I wish more flicks would be) so there's not much filler.

The scene wherein Orca's mate aborts her calf aboard Harris' boat is truly unsettling, to say the least. It goes without saying that you'll be rooting for Orca the whole flick.

There's a very memorable scene wherein Orca causes mass destruction in the village at night (explosions, etc.); Harris looks upon the great havoc as Orca victoriously jumps in and out of the water in utter elation. I caught this ONE scene on TV years ago, before ever seeing the movie, and it just stuck with me. It's a very powerful, well-done sequence (even believable).

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: In my mind there's very little that DOESN'T work in this film, but fans of, say, ""Armegeddon"" might complain that the pace is a little slow at times; others may criticize the melodramatics.

CONCLUSION: This is NOT a Grade B creature-on-the-loose flick (e.g. ""Piranha"" or ""Crocodile""); it's serious, moving and top-of-the-line all the way. If what I've described sounds like your cup of tea, don't miss out on ""Orca""!",1101340800,6,2347,4.737745098039215
263430,5,6300216934,"I happened across this film on AMC. I think it only satisfies one of those initials, but ""Orca"" is better than ""Jaws."" The movie helpfully makes this point by starting with a scene of a Killer Whale beating the snot out of a Great White Shark. This is the most subtle part of the movie.

(Of course, ""Jaws 2"" had the last laugh by showing a bite-mangled Killer Whale. I won't hold my breath to see the rebuttal in ""Orca 2."")

Richard Harris plays a fisherman who leaves Ireland after his family is killed by a careless driver. If they'd chosen to film that scene, Matthew Broderick could have been in it.

Charlotte Rampling, who wears more makeup than a Tom Savini victim, plays a cetacean biologist. This means she blathers on about how smart Orca is, etc. Like most of the minor characters, her motivation constantly wavers, and she doesn't really seem to be all that helpful. Maybe they wanted her for star-power (*snicker*).

Nolan, the fisherman, accidentally kills Orca's mate and their unborn calf. Enraged that his son will never get to star in a ""Free Willy"" sequel, Orca declares vengeance on Nolan. Since whales don't speak English, this declaration consists of Orca glaring, splashing, and making hooting noises with his blowhole.

Orca's campaign of revenge also sets him apart from other marine predators. Jaws is only able to threaten a town economically; Orca can actually blow stuff up and knock over seaside houses. Orca is also remarkably adept at jumping out of the water to bite people while they're on boats. This happens three times, in fact.

He seems content to let Bo Derek off with a warning; instead of killing her, he bites her leg off. Fortunately, it grows back in time for ""10.""

The special effects are incredible, since there aren't any. For Orca scenes, the editor has helpfully spliced in footage of real Killer Whales swimming in a tank at Sea World, which is convincing until you see the bottom. Also, in captivity, Killer Whales' dorsal fins tend to droop, so don't expect a whole lot of continuity in Orca's appearance.

Fortunately for us all, ""Orca"" has been immortalized on DVD. I'm sure you'll wear the bumps off the disc, watching it over and over again.",1101168000,2,2200,4.7408376963350785

263432,3,6300216934,"They killed his wife...they killed his child...they took everything away from him and replaced it with a thirst for justice...a thirst for revenge...sounds like a set up for the 1974 Charles Bronson film Death Wish...but it's not...it's actually for Orca (1977) aka Orca: The Killer Whale.  Now one can say Orca is a completely original film and has nothing to do with the De Laurentiis group (Dino was the executive producer) trying to capitalize on the phenomenal success of the Spielberg film Jaws (1975), the first film to break the 100 million dollar mark, but they would be wrong.  Spielberg's popular and wildly successful giant shark film spawned legions of copycats, all eager to suckle on the cash teat, including films that featured wanton whales (this one), ornery octopuses (okay, it's octopi), savage squids, beastly bigfoots, antagonistic arachnids, barbarous bears and just about any other kind of creature that walks, crawls, swims, or slimes its' way across God's green Earth that you can imagine.

Orca, directed by Michael Anderson, who had just come off directing the sci-fi classic Logan's Run (1976) features Richard (A Man Called Horse) Harris, and perennial 70's film star Charlotte Rampling.  Also appearing are Will Sampson (the big Indian from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), popular character actor Keenan Wynn, Robert Carradine, and in her first on screen appearance, Bo Derek.  As the film opens, we see many good-looking underwater shots of killer whales swimming around, and we see two people, presumably scientists, Rachel (Rampling) and Ken (Carradine), doing some sort of scientific research involving the whales.  We also meet Captain Nolan (Harris), and his crew, as they're trying to capture a great white shark in order to sell it to an aquarium for great profit.  In an effort to show just how much tougher and impressive killer whales are than great white sharks (and a hollow attempt at one-upmanship with the Jaws film), we witness, along with Captain Nolan, a spectacular attack on a great white by a killer whale.  This encourages Nolan to change his goal to giving up on sharks and focus on capturing a killer whale, a decision he will end up regretting.  His attempt turns out badly, as the whale he captures, not only a female, but also a pregnant female, dies in a very bloody fashion.  Now, we soon learn that the whales, being highly intelligent mammals, not only mate for life, but that they also have a capacity for revenge that meets, maybe even exceeds, that of humans.  As Nolan begins to realize the consequences of his actions, regret and remorse creep into his consciousness, and tries to come to terms with what he's done.  Thus begins a slow and deliberate attempt by the whale to draw Nolan out to sea, so that it may give the once haughty captain his comeuppance.

I did like certain things about this film.  I thought the underwater shots of the whales were done well, and exhibited a calm gracefulness that certainly goes against the whale's size and weight.  The story was pretty interesting, and, even though it's riding the coat tails of a much more popular and famous film, as a great number did, it stood out against most of those as being a better overall movie.  Also, I did like Ennio Morricone's very ethereal musical score throughout the film, as it especially accompanied the underwater scenes well.  What I didn't care for in the film was the entire `eco' conscious theme ingrained into the story, a popular cause de jour that was prevalent throughout the late 70's.  I've never advocated the mass slaughter of any species, but to constantly have the notion that all men are evil and destructive thrown continually in my face didn't endear the film to me all that much (maybe I exaggerate, but it did feel that way at times).  The message came across rather heavy-handed and patronizing at times, as I felt like a little kid being lectured by his parents.  I love it when Hollywood tries to teach as well as entertain (remember kids, just because it's on the screen does not mean it has to be true).  The character development in this story seemed weak, especially the element where Nolan `identifies' with the whale (beware, as a severe case of eye-rolling will ensue).  I did feel Nolan floundering back and forth, wrestling with the little voice in his head to be very human.  Rampling's character lacked any development whatsoever, and was only presented as a means to an end, to provide scientific information to Nolan.  There was a glimmer of her character being a romantic interest to Nolan, but that was never pursued.  Sampson's character of Umilak, a Native American of the area, appears only to provide Nolan with the spiritual and mystical aspects of the whale, and nothing else.  The other characters?  Well, you can call them whale fodder, as that was all they were good for...there are a couple of scenes in the film, as others have mentioned, that may not be suitable for young viewers.  I got the feeling two forces were at work in this film, one trying to get across the gentle and warm aspects of the whales, and another intent on trying to include spectacular elements along the lines of those within the Jaws film.  These two ideas seemed to work against each other, creating an odd dichotomy.

The transfer to DVD provided here in wide screen format looks very good, despite minor wear, due to age, to the source material.  There are no special features available, not even a trailer, but that was hardly surprising to me, as Paramount Home Video, when it comes to DVD releases, lacks not only in their output, but also in understanding the value of the inclusion of extras.  All in all, a lack-luster release of a better than average film that owes its' existence to another, much more popular, much more successful, and a much better all around film.

My older teenage brother told me he wanted to see Star Wars but I said that Orca-The Killer Whale looked much better. One of these movies became legendary while the other fell into well deserved obscurity. I didn't see this movie that long ago summer but finally rented it after finding out the director of this movie had died.  There were a number of scenes of the Orca jumping and doing other tricks out in the ocean that were obviously shot in a theme park like Sea World. I watched the end credits and the place was called ""Marine World"" located in South Africa. They used to have an Orca.

7806599,4,6300216934,"Generally watching the movie is nice with good scenes of the Orcas swimming in the ocean which is rare because they go very deep where most scuba divers can't reach and they surface briefly. That's probably why it was made for actual foorage of the sparse mammals for the story it begins fairly bloody that's why I took off one star but the idea was involved with a better plot for why the whale became aggravated after witnessing one of the travelling herd was killed by the propeller under the Yacht fishing boat. The captain wanted to safely bring the Orca to a water park but he didn't shut off the engine and would've dropped the anchor because the ship would just go in circles and the crew was prepared that it would be a tough struggle. Two things went wrong one a shark had frightened a diver placing under water cameras that attracted the Orca to defend the person, modernly the only ocean species to do that is a dolphin I think that the whales don't fight with sharks because they share the warmer tropical currents like Hawaii, Africa or Philliphines so the ocean of Ireland is too cold and has more Blue Whales or Belugas. If the follow the volcanic reef of the Pacific they can go up towards Alaska but they wouldn't be high enough to touch the icebergs they're probably deeper looking for plant food. So when the Orca was caught it turned out to be pregnant so the premature whale was washed back into the water where  they could've been nursed by other females in the group I don't know if the babe actually died  but the mate got angry enough to kill the shark and stalk the harbor after the captain found a nearby harbor. So the humans weren't without loss when slowly members were killed with big explisive accidents triggered by the Orca. If the movie had used a different type of whale it would have been more like other stories of a sea captain hounded by unknown ocean dwellers and it wasn't like most shark movies that occur mainly on the beach. It sounded like the proffessor lady did some voice acting for Skyrim the hired help in Whiterun has a shop that is also a bar that has a dark elf Janeris might be the name so that was cool. One last thing to mention the sounds recorded were very dramatic of the tortured vocals of Orca whales that made the blood scenes seem worse but closely listening to it sounds like monkeys in the rainforest so that might have been why a Orca could travel to Ireland had these sonar waves made it think that the warm water was closer to the wrong coastilne?",1525305600,,2517,4.422413793103448

I wanted to revisit this film for nostalgic reasons as my mother is no longer with me. I love those 70's motion picture film photography that we no longer have with digital. The Blu-ray looked like it was film projection on my 65"" HDTV. Orca the Killer Whale sure brings back childhood memories. I thought the ending was unconventionally brilliant.

The Blu-Ray is also an ""All-Region"" Blu-ray - the disc will definitely play on any Blu-ray system. Looks like the manufacturer made a mistake with labeling it as only ""B region"".",1522281600,,659,4.584745762711864

It begins in the ocean, killer whales swim and play together. One the shore a tape recorder runs. A scuba diver is in the water while a shark swims near. A fishing boat sails by and sees the shark, its target. The orca attacks the shark! The killer whale is a predator found in all oceans, and has a big brain. They can talk and have sonar. That fisherman hopes to catch an orca and sell it. That woman scientist objects to this plan. The captain harpoons a female orca and lifts it out of the water. Her mate swims near the ship and attacks it. They release the orca back to the sea, but it dies. A native warns the captain about the habits of killer whales. The local people don't like to have an orca hanging around, it scares the fish away. An orca attacks boats along the dock and sinks them!

The lady scientist, challenges the captain to seek the orca at sea. Nolan tells her what happened years ago to his pregnant wife. Another attack by an orca creates a fire and explosion! The people want to send Nolan to sea to fight the monster that haunts them. At night the orca attacks a house by the sea, knocking down the pilings! Will Annie fall into the sea? The next day Nolans ship sails out of the port. Nolan plans to throw an explosive into the sea. The orca leaps up to grab Ken! The ship sails north, there are icebergs in the water. Nolan throws a harpoon into the orca, an iceberg hits the ship! Before it sinks the jump onto the iceberg. The orca tips the ice sheet so Nolan slips into the water. The orca lifts Nolan and throws him against the iceberg, he slips into the sea. And so it ends.

Does this movie copy from Jaws? Is it similar to the story of Moby Dick? Is it like a horror movie where the monster triumphs in the end? Is it a story about animal life? This is at best an average story.",1517616000,,1830,4.163841807909605
7806605,1,6300216934,"I couldn't watch the movie because they sent me a movie that said ""Region Error""  ""Playback is not authorized in your region""  and they won't take it back and give me one that works in my region.",1515542400,3,195,4.243243243243243
7806606,4,6300216934,"Even though, Orca was released just two years after Jaws and it was implied by the critics that it was a ""Jaws"" imitation (or that it was trying to bank on the audience ripened by Jaws for a sea-monster genre), I think Orca stands on its own. It is a terrific movie with great visual effects and soundtrack. It is a very well-crafted film telling a story of revenge by a killer whale, Orca. It delivers true scares and surprises all throughout.

The film is 5 star; I took one star off for the following reasons: There are more and more movies that are labeled as ""Region Code B/2: This disc will not play on most American Blu ray players...."" and yet they do actually play on American Blu-ray players. Even though they have region code B/2, somehow they must be coded in such a way to allow playback on American Blu-ray players that are normally designed to play only Region A Blu-ray discs. As the Blu-ray market is getting competitive, I think distributing companies should be very clear about the information they provide on their products as it could be confusing to the average consumer. For instance, on the back of the case, it says ""None"" for subtitles but there is actually subtitles coded on the disc. I own two 4K Blu-ray players. Sony Ubp x800 4K player remote control has ""subtitle"" button. When I press the subtitle button, English subtitles comes on. Just by chance, the other day, I decided to play the film on my Samsung 4K player UBD-KM85C whose remote control does not have ""subtitle"" button. I was not able to put the subtitles on because there is no ""language"" selection on the film's menu. If your Blu-ray player's remote control has ""subtitle"" button, then you are lucky and can put the subtitles on. If not, then you are out of luck. If they coded the subtitles, when why would they not put a ""language"" selection on the menu?

The Blu-ray transfer of the movie is amazingly good (some less-known movies sometimes get lousy transfers but this one is fantastic). With that said, there are artifacts early in the beginning of the movie and in the end of the movie, and some frames towards the end are quite grainy.",1514764800,2,2137,4.577023498694517
