The timeliness of receiving it was excellent as was the packing!",1527724800,,110,4.5
8684869,5,B00OU4MPA0,"Maybe it was just the mood I was in, but I don't think so.  Episode 3, The Software Murders, struck me as an exceptional mystery, adventure and Saintly tale.  Overall, season 2 seems stronger than season 1.  Simon Dutton's portrayal of the Saint has grown on me through the two series of movie length programs.  So now I wish there were more Saint programs with Dutton as well as more  with Roger Moore.  The Simon Dutton Saint programs are much superior to the more recent versions with Val Kilmer and with Adam Rayner.  I am now interested in the Ian Oglby version.  I hope Amazon will offer those programs for streaming or at least in U.S. compatible dvd's.",1508284800,,660,4.533898305084746

8684874,5,B00OU4MPA0,"I have enjoyed the variety of Saint actors including George Sanders, etc, from early movies through Roger Moore, Ian Olgelvy,  and here with Simon Dutton. He is different from all the others in that he is involved in more physical action. His six movies are most enjoyable but this second set seems slightly better. Part of that is probably because I adjusted to his interpretation of the character. Dutton is very straightforward in performance. He doesn't play the more fun-loving, sarcastic versions that came before this .He does have the tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. But the movies are so well done that by the time you get to the fifth movie, you are completely into the stories. I recommend all six films (two sets) if you enjoy films of this genre that are well done.",1428278400,3,778,4.762962962962963
8684875,4,B00OU4MPA0,Seems to be entirely new material but is faithful to the character and plotting of the novels. Amusing repartee but too many car chases. Very interesting international casts and settings,1427328000,,186,5.233333333333333
8684876,5,B00OU4MPA0,"Simon Dutton is wonderful as the saint, good actor put his own unique quality in the role for whatever reason love the second set better if it sells well enough hopefully he will do one more movie or do a cameo in a new adaptation of the series story lines are good & so are the villains he deals with more sinister & cunning as well love this eighties version of the saint.",1424044800,2,374,4.136986301369863
8684877,5,B00OU4MPA0,"I actually love the Simon dutton version from 89, remember when it aired on wwor TV. I have purchased both seasons 1&2 am so glad acorn released both seasons so quickly. I half to be honest set 2 is my favorite seen it digitally, DVD & on the acorn ch on my roku device goes to show you how much of a fan am. my favorite ep from set 1 was the Brazilian connection. My favorites from set 2 are all three of them the wrong number big bang & the software murders the villains & the story lines plus the action is better. Simon dutton plays the role with relish & sophistication he is also tougher then Roger Moore despite the fact I still love the Moore version from the sixties hopefully collectibles will be released as well think it is selling well enough finally have em all digital & DVD happen to be proud of it. the software murders worked for me on every level Simon teams up with a computer expert well played by Pamela sue Martin who also brought the same unique quality she had when she played Nancy drew it was a superb combination will definitely see them over & over again",1422835200,,1083,4.236714975845411
