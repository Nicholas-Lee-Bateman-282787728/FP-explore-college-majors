This DVD covers the nationals of the serious competitors in the robot fighting sport, the Robot Fighting League.  And the no-house bots, no arena-hazards, no BS way of RFL fighting makes for much more exciting, and much more dramatic battles.

The image quality is fantastic, and the production values are very high.  Each match includes information about the robots fighting, often including details of the design for the hard core who want to build their own robot.

If you're interested in building a fighting robot, you gotta get this DVD.  If you were just a fan of the TV shows, buy this to see how far robots have come, and how good straight up fighting can be.",1132099200,5,733,4.6434108527131785
