8139992,2,B000HIVILA,"Not really a good documentary at all. The bits with his cocaine addled girlfriend, Lisa Pritchett-Johnson, were almost unwatchable. If you have to choose between watching this documentary or gouging your eyes out with a spoon I'd suggest you use a really sharp spoon.",1508198400,,267,5.090909090909091
8139993,5,B000HIVILA,There is no bass player better! I loved seeing him.... I miss him,1441584000,,65,4.076923076923077
8139994,5,B000HIVILA,Pretty awesome! My only complaint is that it was to short :),1410134400,,60,4.083333333333333
8139995,4,B000HIVILA,"As a Who fan, this documentary did not really contain any information I did not already know, but is still worth owning for the Entwistle footage alone.",1401062400,,152,4.666666666666667
8139996,3,B000HIVILA,"If I were Entwistle, I'd have bashed the interviewer, the first time he bashed the headstock of my priceless guitar against the shelf. The second time, he'd have been out on his ear. And leaning on the bass that I was ""going to be buried with""? Who is this guy? Overall, not much to rave about, but if you're an Entwistle fan, you're going to want it anyway.",1366934400,,358,4.279411764705882
8139997,3,B000HIVILA,Fairly boring ramble around his life and home. Doesn't add much and would probably have been scrapped if he hadn't died shortly after.,1311292800,2,134,4.869565217391305
8139998,3,B000HIVILA,"Compared to an Ox's Tale, this is a tatty production.  There is a lot of filler including John just standing in front of his amp noodling solo.  Now, I'm a huge JE fan and a bass player myself, but even I can hardly stand to watch another man's noodle, let alone paying for that right.  The interviewer and the interviewess frequently appear stiff, or in the case of John's late girlfriend, worse.

It would have been nice to see some video of John's 70's band Rigor Mortis, but I'd have settled for some rehashed Who video. Either the producers couldn't afford or didn't bother to get any clearance of Who or Entwistle video material, so this is really a cheapo production.  All of that being said, this rates three stars for some of the Entwistle humor poking through, and that there probably isn't much left in the vaults anyway.  But if this DVD were a bass, I have no doubt John would have smashed the hell out of it.  An Ox's Tale is superior to this.",1194566400,7,957,4.403409090909091
8139999,5,B000HIVILA,"I've seen bits of this on the web,and I'm glad I was able to find a copy here. It'll make a great companion piece,to Ox's tale. I highly recommend it,to any true fan.",1191801600,,166,4.0606060606060606
8140000,4,B000HIVILA,"I bought this and AN OX'S TALE at approximately the same time.  THUNDERFINGERS is built around an interview with Entwistle in his home rather than a biography as AOT is.  Both of these DVDs complement each other, despite being produced at different times by different people.  I recommend both of them, but if you can only get one, get AN OX'S TALE.  It has more biographical info as well as interviews with other people associated with Entwistle.

Having only watched this once, I do not have much more to say.  The segments where Entwistle is showing off some of his guitar collection was interesting.  I had never heard of his theory about why he was a bass guitar player as opposed to a bass player.  Granted this might no be too interessting to a non-fan, but if you bothered to read this, or any other review, of this DVD, you are probably enough of an Entwistle fan to want THUNDERFINGERS an to enjoy it.  So buy a copy.  You'll find something in it you'll like or find intersting.

Hell, I bought his bass instructional video and I don't even own a bass.

I don't intend to buy a bass, either.

Yes, there are interesting points in that DVD, even for a non-bass guitarist.

Hey! Imanaged to comment on three DVDs in one review.

Get 'em all!!

8140001,4,B000HIVILA,Great overall look into the life and music of John Entwistle. Recommended for any serious bassist or Who fan.,1168387200,,109,4.7894736842105265
