I didn't give it 5 stars because I would have liked a longer DVD for the price, with more instruction especially using candles. I thought the movements were rather easy, consisting mostly in hip circles, figure 8's and some arm movements but the section on belly rolls was excellent.",1256428800,2,448,4.6835443037974684
8193657,5,B000PWZVDE,"This dvd is so worth it!  But not worth over $30, be aware!  Anyway this dvd shows you belly roll and how to drill belly rolls!  Intense.  Also it teaches how to dance with candles, and what moves of arms ect are used.  I had to search on the internet forever when I was looking for dancing with candles.  This dvd appeared almost the only one and I bought.  It is in my library as a bellydance specialty.",1210291200,3,405,4.115384615384615
