8670968,5,B00M9W2T74,Couldn't wait to get my Kettlebell AMPD DVD and try it out! I have done several other Kettlebell workouts and they are just ok. Kettlebell AMPD is different....it actually goes with the music! The various modifications that are explained are great for those just beginning or those who want to taylor their workout to meet specific needs. I recently had surgery and am happy that I can ease my way back into exercising with the variations demonstrated. This is a great workout for the entire body!,1411776000,2,497,4.790697674418604
8670969,5,B00M9W2T74,"Great total body work out.  It's a challenging workout, but there are options shown throughout that make this adaptable to every fitness level.  I couldn't do every routine at the most difficult level shown, but that gives me something to work towards.  I probably have a dozen or more fitness DVD's and this has become the ""go to"".  Nothing else I've tried delivers everything that this  workout does.  If you don't have time for the full workout, it's easy to break it down into whatever amount of time you have available. It's great for toning, strength and there's even a sufficient amount of cardio.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone.  I bought a 10 pound kettlebell and that seems to be right for me for this workout. I'm moderately fit and not interested in building mega muscles.  My goals are to burn calories, and be more fit and toned.  This is perfect for that. Others may find they prefer a lighter or heavier kettlebell, but keep in mind that you will be doing a lot of reps.",1410739200,2,1000,4.5363128491620115
8670970,4,B00M9W2T74,"I am a beginner of kettlebell exercising. Amy starts out with warming up and explanations of all the moves. I am starting slow but will buildup with this DVD. I like having the first section with her explaining the moves and the second one with no verbal part, to just do the workout. I recommend this DVD to others to try.",1410652800,2,323,4.311475409836065
