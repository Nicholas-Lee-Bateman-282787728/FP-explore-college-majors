8261543,5,B00168AOA6,"Fell in love with the Spinervals series this winter because I can just put the DVD in and be coached on what to do.  This is exactly what I need as you're told what gear to be in, how hard your effort should be, whether to sit/stand, in the drops/aero/on the brake hoods.  So if you're like me and have no idea how to train on a bicycle, Spinervals is exactly what we're looking for!  I bought this as VHS because it's cheaper than DVD and I actually have a VHS in my basement setup - very happy with the VHS version.",1303084800,,517,4.049019607843137
