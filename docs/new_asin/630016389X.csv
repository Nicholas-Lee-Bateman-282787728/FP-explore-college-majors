211021,5,630016389X,"It is a movie that teenagers and parents should see. It helps to understand how peer pressure affects the individuality of children and how sucumb to temptation because inspite of knowing that the use of drugs is not safe, thay don't know how to say no.

The end of the movie is for me extraordinary""Th speech of the teacher very body does it...well I don't and you are the future

are very energetic and specially true.

211022,5,630016389X,this is a great movie..images of intense teen drug use...an incredible roller coaster ride...so many lives disrupted by the drug use.. but even though the movie shows so many negative things about drugs... unfortunately the movie may actually encourage drug usage...the teen drug users are truly the happening crowd in movie..I can definitely see teens watching this and wrongly believing this is a pro-drug movie...when in fact it is not...,1118620800,3,441,5.314285714285714

211024,5,630016389X,"This movie is the quintessence of late 70's drug cartel in American High Schools.  With so many drugs being used, so many different ages and situations being shown, and the ignorance of the administration and adults in place.  This movie shows that not only did the students not know the dangers, but more importantly, the parents and staffs of schools didn't know the problems.  The police are the only ones who seem to really care here, as in the late 70's.  I will say I'd watch this video over and over just to see the girl say weeeee at the end.  Spectacular job CBS did!",1014681600,8,576,4.447619047619048

211095,5,630016389X,This is a good movie and I watched it when I was young. I am 41 now and wanted to buy it for my kids to watch! It is a good movie to prevent drug use and what can happen if they use.....,1388534400,,186,3.3488372093023258
211096,4,630016389X,"I'd like to think of this as the ""Gone With The Wind"" of anti-teen drug TV movies (Linda Blair in Richard Donner's ""Sarah T.- Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic"" is of course the ""Citizen Kane"" of the genre).

The Helen Hunt window dive on dust and the climactic drive off the cliff take all the glory. But the scenes with Diane Ladd as the mom of stoned teenagers and Diana Scarwid giving mouth-to-mouth on a doped-in-the-pool Michelle Green are very underrated. Sam Bottoms as the sleazy dealer also delivers amazing scenes every time he's on camera. In many ways, he was Wooderson a decade before ""Dazed and Confused"" was lensed.

Buy two copies... because ""everyone does it"" and one of your stoned friends is likely to steal a copy.",1377734400,2,733,4.674418604651163
211097,5,630016389X,Saw it a long time ago and wanted to see it again.  Its an old 80's movie about drugs.  Good tv movie.,1362960000,,102,3.590909090909091
211098,1,630016389X,"While there were some amusing 80s moments- lots of feathered hair, Jordache jeans, etc. there was nary a hallucination scene in the entire plodding film!!! What self-respecting drug film (if there is such a thing) doesn't have a hallucination sequence??? Still, for some reason I was compelled to watch the whole thing.

The main message here is the classic ""Pot is a gateway drug that will lead to your demise"" stuff. Perhaps that's why the drug scenes are a total disappointment.

I believe this was a TV movie too; there are lots of commercial-fade-outs, and euphemisms. My favorite is a teen saying ""In your hat!"". I'm sorry, but I grew up in the 80s and I don't ever recall any teen ever saying that ever. Maybe in the 1940s. Same with ""turkey"", which seems to be a TV euphemism for other expletives.

One interesting thing here is that the teens seemed to be better actors than the adults.

Diana ""Mommie Dearest"" Scarwid does some serious overacting, and the final scene is kind of a nice hokey pay-off, complete with applause -- SPOILER ALERT-- still, how did everyone not get high from those bonfire fumes?

Not really worth more than a couple of bucks.",1341878400,,1162,4.704433497536946

211100,5,630016389X,"I remember this movie telecast on CBS back in 1982 as the movie of the week.  Even though it's a little on the corny side in it's portrayal of the drug problem plaguing high schools in the late '70s & early '80s, it has it's own distinct charm about it.  This movie was one of the last ones that I remember that had a bit of an ""After School Special"" message to it.  By the mid-'80s, the choice of good made-for-tv movie shrunk with the inception of speciality cable channels and so on.  There are some recognizable faces in this tele-flick like Helen Hunt from ""Mad About You"", ""Twister"" and many other made-for-tv and theatrical releases, William Holden, Doug McKeon, Michelle Green and Grant Cramer from ""Hardbodies"" and ""Killer Klowns From Outer-Space"" fame.  My overall rating is based on the DVD production of this movie.  The video transfer is very clear and looks just like it did back when it was first telecast, the sound is good too.  There are no added features like commentaries, scene choices or promos for this DVD.  It is very basic.  It's great when major distributors like Warner Brothers release TV movies, because they are flawless in their presentations, unlike when some junior distributors release made-for-tv classics.  This disc was recently released in 2010, along with a large collection of other made-for-tv gems like ""Bad Ronald"" and 'Divorce Wars""-to name a couple of titles.  If you are a fan of '70s & '80s made-for-tv movies, this title will not disappoint!",1275609600,2,1490,4.803921568627451
211101,5,630016389X,"Basically bought this to watch the scenes of a young Helen Hunt freak out on drugs and jump out of a window (yes, it was this film she did it in and NOT the flick Angel Dusted as so many other claim), which I so fondly remembered giggling at in my youth. However, it's a pretty decent film. Fairly realistic in parts, although it does go a bit over-the-top in terms of credibility at times. Haven't been able to find it on dvd, so had a pay a bit more for a VHS release...always fun to spend a lot of money on a flick only available in a dying technological format!! But, I ""HAD"" to have it for my collection, so there you go.",1261612800,,626,4.056451612903226
211102,4,630016389X,"I remember watching this when I was younger, but I didn't get many of the drug references until I recently watched it again. This movie is hilarious, not only does Helen Hunt jump out of a window after she snorts some angel dust, screaming that she is invincible and that bugs are crawling all over her, but another girl smokes angel dust while she's driving her car and as she goes off the cliff, she has this really peaceful smile and she says ""wheeeeee,"" and she ends up crashing and dying. It seems like every single kid in this high school does drugs. The whole time the new counselor is trying to clean up the school all by herself, she ends up going through the students lockers and one by one pulls out stash after stash of drugs and burns them at a student pep rally. Pleading for the kids to stop using, its quite funny. THis actress is the same actress that played Christina in the movie ""mommie dearest."" She has a really annoying accent in this movie, and at times you just want to slap her. If you can find this movie, watch it. Make sure you have some party favors handy.",1150588800,2,1086,4.328431372549019
7803429,5,630016389X,"I liked this movie because it is an anti-drug movie,the acting wasn't the greatest,but i like Ms. Scarwid's performance in this movie. I believe the acting was sub-par because that's what hollywood wanted,they are pro-drugs anyway.",1517184000,,231,5.444444444444445

7803434,5,630016389X,"So campy. So cheesy. So 1980's.

Most of us who grew up in the 1980's remember seeing this as an afternoon special or watching it on VHS in health/speech class.  Or at least remember hearing about others who did.  It has a KILLER song from Rick Springfield (Jessie's Girl wasn't his only song), and the fabulous Helen Hunt.
I actually purchased this because I remember my health teachers discussing how they used to show this film about drug use, but now they show ""Philadelphia"" about AIDS.  I teach middle school and had a drug awareness group come in and do activities with the kids, and this was to show to the kids who had already completed the activity.

Was it up to date with pertinent information?  Absolutely not.  Was it believable?  Not for me in the slightest.  The 7th graders were all about it.  They were amazed at how many kids were misinformed in the 1980's about drug use.  Which became a good platform to talk about drugs.  The kids also liked it because it took place around the time ""Stranger Things"" is based on, so that was pretty cool.
Would I show it again, perhaps.  It depends on the kids.  Will it win any awards?  No.  Should you preview it before you watch it.  Totally.  Are there better",1477353600,3,1219,4.488584474885845
7803435,5,630016389X,"This is a very good  cult  (drug culture)  film. I remember watching it on television way back when it first aired, and all the hype about it before and after it aired. Helen Hunt was very good in her role here, which must have been one of her earliest appearances. While this film may seem Korny  in places, and at times, it still does a very good job of showing how teens can easily give in to peer pressure, use drugs, and the film has some very sobering  scenes of the sometimes devastating results of drug abuse.  So overall I highly recommend this film as well worth watching.",1475539200,3,582,4.342592592592593
