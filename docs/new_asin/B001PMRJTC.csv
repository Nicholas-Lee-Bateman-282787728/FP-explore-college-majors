And being a fan of musicals, I am happy that Burton took the risk in making it as such instead of simply a movie about a Barber killing just about everyone.  Sleepy Hollow, love the story, and again, Johnny Depp is great!  BUY THESE MOVIES ON BLU-RAY!  The quality just brings out the picture even more.  SIGN IT!",1242086400,5,435,4.5

8333802,4,B001PMRJTC,"Finally, it seems shelling out nearly thirty bucks for Sweeney Todd on blu-ray is worth it...now you get the Sleepy Hollow blu-ray for practically nothing. Actually, since this 2-pack became available the price of the Sweeney Todd blu-ray by itself has dropped about five bucks but really you are paying [..] a piece to own Sweeney and Sleepy together...

Now for the good stuff. If you didn't already know, Sweeney Todd on blu-ray looks magnificent. I thought the standard def DVD was beautiful but the blu-ray trumps it in almost every respect. The soundtrack (which is the true star of the film) is about as perfect as one could expect. This film seems to be ""love it"" or ""hate it"" with most people so if you find you are kinda in the middle you will definitely benefit from seeing it in full 1080p glory. Burton may have arguably made some better films (Ed Wood for one) but this one is right up there in the upper echelon of musical theatre and gothic horror, even if some of it may feel a little too conjoined at times.

Sleepy Hollow on the other hand is a different story. The film itself is the perfect late-night horror feature. Depp plays Ichabod Crane as sort of a fey Peter Cushing in Burton's puritan nightmare. The sets (this film won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction -- as did Sweeney Todd) and the costumes are breathtaking but fail to truly come alive in Paramount's lackluster hi-def transfer. Much has been debated about ""filmic"" quality recently and while grain is certainly inherent to film (this picture will not look the same as Pirates of the Caribbean) the transfer here left a lot to be desired. Only a small step up from the standard def DVD, the blu-ray may disappoint some who have come to expect more clarity and detail from even older films on this new format.

If you are a Tim Burton or Johnny Depp fan (in addition to Hammer Horror), this 2-pack of essential Burton/Depp films should be a no-brainer. If you purchased Sweeney Todd on DVD before the blu-ray came out you will not find the rebate offer with this package; it is only available for a limited time on the individual Sweeney Todd blu-ray disc. The two discs repackaged here are exactly the same as the individual ones (minus the mail-in rebate on Sweeney) and offer up a mixed bag of sadistic singing barbers, cowardly constables, murderous meat pies and headless Hessians...sure to thrill & delight apparitions of all ages!",1237248000,12,2428,4.655011655011655
