7998863,5,B0000CD5EU,"Cura is definitely a consummate musician: he sings, directs, plays the piano. And he does them all with mastery, easy, and very high caliber performance.  I happen to love Cura's tenor delivery. He is a great Otello, Trovatore, Samson, Edgar, Cavaradossi in traditional productions. His good looks in all these roles don't hurt either. I won't say as much for his own production of Samson ...",1377561600,,392,4.9393939393939394
7998864,2,B0000CD5EU,"Oh,please Cura...Get some tuxedo(he dressed a black camisole at Barbican),give up baton and SING,only! In fact,this is a fine soprano Daniela Dess recital. Mr. Cura believes himself the most terrific conductor(terrible Nabucco overture)actor,singer,Verdi

expert,host,...in this world.""Lasciate ogni speranza"" about this beautiful tenor voice and don't waste your money.",1093651200,2,370,6.708333333333333
7998865,3,B0000CD5EU,"Bought this as a leap of faith.  I have enjoyed previous Cura recordings.  Don't know what the folks at Kultur were thinking.  The DVD cover has no list of songs for the production.  There is no libretto inside.  Worse, the performance lacks subtitles except for one dialog, a reading from Don Alvero.  Having said that Jose' Cura's performance is quite satisfying.  He is accompanied by Daniela Dessi, who is at times distracting with her facial expressions, but also sings quite well.  Cura conducts the orchestra in several of the overtures.  It adds nothing to the performance.  For the record the DVD includes overtures to Nabucco, Les Vespres Sicilennes, Don Carlo and La Forza Del Destino.  There are two arias from Il Corsaro, one from Ernani, one from Il Torvatore and Aida.  ""Lo vengo a domandar"" and ""Tu che le vanita"" are included from Don Carlo.  The disc concludes with a selection from La Forza del Destino and ""Gi nella notte densa"" from Otello.",1080950400,13,961,4.822085889570552
