This is a mature oriented anime focused on a spiritual strength forged in the bond of friendship that transcend life and death. A journey of a dying woman , in a surreal, dreamlike land, fighting for survival.
It is quite beautiful indeed. There a some nudity and gore but not excessive and still serves to move to story.
With a price like that, it's totally worth your money.",1393286400,,514,4.5978260869565215
7998260,3,B0000C52G2,"I wanted the time travel anime Time Stranger, about a kid who travels in a machine to feudal Japan. I had it on video once. This, Etranger, also called Time Stranger, is a movie sequel to tho old GoShogun series. Not what I ordered, but 'I think I keep it.' (To quote Sinbad in Golden Voyage.) Good old-school anime.",1365292800,,316,4.372881355932203
7998261,4,B0000C52G2,"This cartoon is like an episode of Twilight Zone mixed with a little bit of zombie shooting Resident Evil (the video game).  The cartoon is a little bit boring but it is pretty smooth.  The plots lead you from A to B to C clearly. This cartoon is a little bit like the other movie called ""Jacob's Ladder"".  But instead of a scary movie, this cartoon is very heart touching and I love the songs!

This dub is very good.  If you switch between the Japanese track and the English track, the English track sounds much much better.

Voice acting is very good too except for the funny voice from the old witch. I can't tell whether or not that character is a man or a woman.

4 stars it is!",1190764800,6,684,4.175572519083969
