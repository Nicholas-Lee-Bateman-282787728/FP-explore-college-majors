5170245,5,B008N6RNVW,"This is one of the Booth Brothers greatest production hits. I really enjoyed watching it & I know you'll love it too! BUT...I suggest that you buy it really soon, to add to your paranormal, horror, & suspense, library, because they sell out quick, since not many are are made & most ""Booth Brothers"" films are a rare find & hard to get cheap.",1376611200,4,342,4.359375
5170246,5,B008N6RNVW,Used this for a slide show.  Everyone got a kick out of this.  Way to funny.  Perfect for any party.,1354320000,,100,3.9
5170247,5,B008N6RNVW,"These two gentlemen are a huge inspiration, I hold much admiration and respect for them and their work and also their outlook on investigating, it isn't a competition, it isn't about who went in where first, nor who has the latest shiny whizz bang gadgets... Philip sums it up at best at the end of this feature.. (you'll have to watch it to find out what he says!) I love their insight, wisdom and their compassion, it shows through in all their documentary features and music, including this one, which is a behind the scenes look at some of the amazing films and documentaries they have made already.. ""The Unseen"" If you're into well made paranormal documentaries based on actual events, then the Booth Brothers documentaries are for you! My personal favourite is still ""Children Of the Grave"", Zombie road fascinated me, and I would love to investigate there! Allen Tiller",1346112000,8,877,4.814569536423841

5170257,2,B008N6RNVW,love love the booth brothers normally so i sprung for this in the hopes i would love it as much as the ones included with prime. its very cheezy and jumps around a lot. not a great buy :( also they waste a lot of time plugging a movie they made. wasn't worth it for me,1465948800,,268,3.8035714285714284

5170262,5,B008N6RNVW,This documentary shows the compassion the brothers have for the dearly departed.  You can rest assured they will treat each spirit with due respect.  They really care for what they are doing.,1436659200,2,191,4.9375
5170263,4,B008N6RNVW,I was intensely interested in seeing their movies after having seen this. I just want to see more.  I wish there was a little more personal info about the twins that's the only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars!!,1436400000,,214,4.219512195121951
5170264,5,B008N6RNVW,"Great Stuff!  Never heard of these Brothers and they really have a lot of talent and are passionate about what they do and are never exploiting, always researching and honoring the truth behind some of the stories of Tragic deaths and the paranormal.  Want more of thes Twins!  Great Work Boys!
God Bless

5170267,4,B008N6RNVW,"Very good, but the EVPs are really questionable and they use a specialty camera in a hallway area of an abandon building and it looks like a child in the camera which is not using regular vision.  Turns out to be a wood shipping pallet on it's side, and they go to the area to view it while recording and put their foot on it and shows in regular vision a pallet, but the camera, whatever filter or view they are suing masks the pallet partially and looks like a child.  They still try to pass it off as a spirit.  UNCOOL.",1432252800,5,522,4.098039215686274

8529057,5,B008N6RNVW,"For all the people who are expecting something to jump out at them holding a severed head in one hand, well that only happens in your . What I watched was the reality based side of all the hype injected shows that are on television. What I experienced was two brothers who based upon earlier life experiences chose a change of path in life that included a journey that not only took them to where the line between the human and the paranormal plane literally becomes non-existent, but through their documentary style of sharing their experiences, they successfully (in my humble opinion) gave the Hollywood blood and gore industry a shot of reality by putting faces behind the stories of such tragic events like the children in the grave, or the bone dump with all the personal affects such as glasses, shirts, shoes, combs, toothbrushes, IV bottles......... all these items belonged to people such as ourselves who one day found themselves void of any identity except a number on a grave marker.
 No, the Booth brothers aren't what you might call ""Ken Burns"" in their style of film documentaries, but I can definitely see Ken Burns reflecting upon this work, as a documentarian and fellow artist, and thinking of both Booth brothers and their gifted crew with respect and admiration.
I thought the end, when discussing how to embrace those who've yet to cross over left a component of reality out of focus. That was the fact that a lot of paranormal experiences also expose real and dangerous proof of the demonic forces that also surround us and that their is a fear based reality to ghost hunting and demonology that as also been documented.",1510272000,,1644,4.768421052631579
8529058,4,B008N6RNVW,"What you'd call a 'behind the scenes' documentary of other documentary movies that they've directed/produced. It's worth a watch even if you haven't seen their movies. It points out what's going on/what went on from their other movie/docs and makes it worth checking them out again; which I've started to do, since watching this. It makes the rewatch (or even first watch) a little more interesting, knowing what they went through while in shooting and in post; that's where I get 'behind the scenes' take on it.

And I agree with the philosophy the brothers have on 'ghost hunting'. People need to stop with the bullying while their ghost 'chasing'. Seriously. Who the hell wants to be made to turn a light off or on, or even make something move just to prove to you they're real.. you're there visiting them - screw the side show. Be respectful. Like they really have the energy to do something for you. Do something for them and shut up. They're trying to read.",1502323200,2,964,4.670588235294118
8529059,5,B008N6RNVW,loved it! really interesting history.,1501632000,,37,6.6
8529060,5,B008N6RNVW,Very well filmed.  Especially the part about the Concho Indians..I watched it through tears..One great watch!,1496448000,,109,5.8125
8529061,2,B008N6RNVW,Too cheesy for my taste. No paranormal jewels or significant standards of proof; really just a documentary of several documentaries...,1496188800,4,134,5.75
8529062,3,B008N6RNVW,"I would have given this more stars were it not for the grating noises on just about every scene change. I guess they've never heard the saying ""less is more."" The scenes would have come off a lot more effective if they had just moved along without the jarring movements from scene to scene that distract you. This had some goosebump moments, but they were ruined by all the noise and flash. Could not finish watching it.",1494633600,6,420,4.467532467532467
8529063,2,B008N6RNVW,"This movie should be free to everyone and should be referred to as a documentary. I could only stand ten minutes of it since it came across strictly as a promotion piece with the emphasis on their achievements of films that they produced in the past. You may even get a glimpse or two of films you have seen before and for sure you will see what a large production the filming process involves. You will then have a keener understanding of why 99.9% of the genre in paranormal investigation programs ""are for entertainment purposes only.""",1493942400,,538,4.614583333333333
