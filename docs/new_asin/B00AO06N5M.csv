5462426,1,B00AO06N5M,"B-movie?  Check.  Giant spiders from space? Check. 3D?? Double check.  A recipe for a fun, silly and campy movie with 3D effects that I couldn't wait to watch.

I barely made it through it.  It's not fun, it's not campy, it's not exciting nor is it even creepy  (spiders freak me out).  This is a hugely wasted opportunity for a fun movie that could have had a cult status.  How can anyone make a 3D spider movie and never have a single spider jump out at you?

I cancelled my pre-order within 15 minutes of watching the movie and encourage anyone to watch this before you buy the film.  $8 is cheaper than $20.",1361923200,11,611,4.280701754385965
5462427,1,B00AO06N5M,"Okay, if you like trash, this might be the movie for you. The 3D is AWFULLY converted and makes your eyes bleed without any visible depth... The acting is horrible. Christa Campbell cannot move her face because of all the botox, and Patrick Muldoon has seen better days and there is a sense of desperation radiating from him during the whole movie. And no, it does not have to do with his character. The story is on SyFy Channel level, the FX are slightly better than usual in a production like this one... If you have to see every monster movie on the market, than give it a try, but you have been warned. Don't expect ""Eight Legged Freaks"" from outer space as the movie takes itself so seriously, that there is not the slightest sense of humor in this production. At least not wanted one. What a waste of money...

Edit: I read in some comments that the 3D is not working right on some discs. Guess that is the case with mine. But I have to say: even if the 3D would work, it does not make this bad movie better... The rest stays the same...",1361836800,2,1043,4.267676767676767

I did like the movement of the spiders..especially the giant Queen Spider. The way she reacted to explosions and fire was very realistic. Also, it was nice to see William Hope (LT. Gorman from movie ALIENS) playing the heartless Colonel. This movie is definitely worth watching if you like ""creature features"".

So when I saw this title I decided to give myself a shiver and rented it, even though there were no reviews posted.  I hope others will read this review first and save themselves the pain and lost time that I suffered.  Simply put, this movie is an abomination.  Horrible acting, directing and writing.

5462440,3,B00AO06N5M,"Thinking of how some low budget cover art shows epic views to summarize the movie and then the movie doesn't have any scenes remotely like it, but in the case of Spiders 3D, there actually is a giant Queen Spider that giant size in the movie, and even the explosions and helicopters are present in the movie, which was a nice surprise for this low budget horror movie.
Are there lots of spiders, small, medium to large? Yes. Lots of humans get bit and die from the spiders. That's what most people pay to see when they watch giant arachnids take over the city and this movie delivers the goods. A little bit of gore, but not much.
Special effects are CGI and not too bad for a low budget film. If anyone goes into this knowing it's low budget and expecting AAA effects, hopefully they learn their lesson to keep expectations realistic. What's here is fun, simple and effective in showing giant monsters attacking people. Some good interactions where the spiders lift people up and eat them. The main actor? Great performance.
The low budget 3D conversion is kind of a mix of poor, average and sometimes potent 3D, but mostly the 3D is just about there, so I wouldn't recommend it for those looking for the best 3D. Some good pop outs. This conversion of the 3D has a lot of technical issues, like varying highlights of subtle light in each camera on the characters and scenery creating conflict when both eyes combine the images into one. Other problems with the 3D would include conflict between the depth of the CGI and live humans, which sometimes aren't on the right planes of depth, and it just looks weird sometimes. For low budget, it's passable 3D, but has lots of room for improvement. 3D is mostly there for the exciting scenes (sometimes good 3D) and then is forgettable the rest of the movie.",1436832000,,1804,4.570987654320987

This was the most cardboard cast I've ever seen. Not even the lead made you care  one bit about him or his family. Yes the spiders looked cool, But it was not enough to make this show work. it was just bland. And it's really sad, because you know it took millions to make it, and nobody will remember this five years down the road.

5462459,1,B00AO06N5M,"Spiders (Tibor Takcs, 2013)

What possessed me? What could have possibly entered my head to make me say hey, this movie was directed by Tibor Takcs, who hasn't made a watchable movie since 1987, and here we are twenty-five years later, so the obvious thing I should be doing right now is pressing play!? I can't answer that question, but I can confidently report to you now that Spiders, Takcs' latest piece of celluloid garbage, as just as accomplished as such timeless Takcs classics as Mansquito (I actually own that one!), Ice Spiders, Mega Snake, and Meteor Storm.

Plot: the Soviets have been developing something on a space station, which meets disaster thanks to a stray meteoroid. (This scene looks remarkably like the space station being destroyed in the trailer for the upcoming Sandra Bullock film Gravity, to the point where I wondered if both used the same stock footage.) A piece of it crash lands in the New York City subway system, and the NY politicos send Jason (Starship Troopers' Patrick Muldoon, whose career has unfortunately not gotten any better since 1999), a middle-management subway muckety-muck, to investigate. He finds big holes and, more alarmingly, a few dead homeless folks who don't look like they got hit with debris. He digs some eggs out of one and takes them home to his wife Rachel (Drive Angry's Christa Campbell), who conveniently happens to be a scientist. Problem is, The former-Soviet geneticist who was in charge of the project before the Union was dissolved (Blade II's Pete Lee-Wilson) and his army handler (Aliens' William Hope) want those eggs...and they will stop at nothing, including kidnapping Jason and Rachel's daughter Emily (The Ward's Sydney Sweeney) and her hot babysitter (Conan the Barbarian's Shelly Varod) to get them.

If you've seen any two random Tibor Takcs movies since The Gate, you know exactly what to expect here. (If you haven't, more power to ya.) Braindead script, shoddy camerawork, overdramatic soundtrack, you name it. Even those rare times when Takcs manages to come up with crack cast members (the nadir of Ron Perlman's career was acting in Takcs' Rats in 2002), he manages to pull the worst performances you've ever seen out of them, so with a cast like this, you know you're going to get glimpses of cheeseball glory. Problem is, even the glory is missing from this one, it's just dreary. Dumb, predictable, not even worth watching for the terrible special effects. Give it a miss.

The whole movie was boring all the way, it was making me fall asleep. The spiders in this movie, don't look like spiders, they look like over-sized ticks, the CGI was really awful in this movie, speaking of CGI, this movie is filled with very bad CGI, like for example there's a scene when some people jump through a window, and they use CGI for the broken glass pieces. This movie is taken way too seriously, it trys way too hard, but then it fails. The dialouge is awful, the effects are awful, and the direction for this movie was horrendous, they take PG-13 rating way too seriously, so yeah this movie is an earth sized of s***, don't see this movie, go see Spiders (2000), stay far away from this remake.",1373760000,,1154,4.422535211267606

5462467,3,B00AO06N5M,"From the title Spiders, you might suppose this is a movie about spiders and you would be 100% right. There are little spiders that poison you and fill you with their offspring, dog-sized spiders that eat people, and a giant spider that fights tanks. All the spiders are very competent CG, and the army-versus-spider mayhem is very well realized. If you're looking for a modern take on the classic ""giant X attacks the big city"" horror films of the 50s, this is your movie, stop reading.

Unfortunately Spiders falters as a film otherwise. Out of control color correction makes everything look washed out and fake, the soundtrack is laden with silly dramatic piano stings that just don't work, and the acting from stars Patrick Muldoon (most likely cast because he was in Starship Troopers) and Christa Campbell (who you might remember from cable movies you snuck downstairs to watch after your parents went to bed) is wooden and uninteresting.

Your enjoyment of this film, then, depends on what you look for in movies. If you want a big campy thriller about monster spiders from space (yes, that's right, space) then you'll have a ball. If you want something deeper than a bunch of B movie stars being chased around a subway by big spiders then you'd better move along.

5462473,4,B00AO06N5M,"I bought the 2D version, didn't know it was a 3D movie, doesn't really matter, I liked it anyway.  I have quite a collection of spider movies (crazed-insect movies in general); this one fits in with the rest.
Granted, the mechanics of the plot aren't particularly fresh or new.  The story was definitely recycled from many other movies (which was quite 'green' of them: waste not want not!).  The characters weren't particularly compelling.  They served the plot and that's about it.  No one shamed themselves (although at this point, Patrick Muldoon might consider being a bit pickier with parts).  His role had him down as an ex-husband, delinquent dad of sorts.  Naturally, he had to protect his splintered family (didn't quite catch what the marital problem was, they just needed that type of dynamic and plugged it into the story: daughter in danger and all that).  The story also suffered from a stock villain, the usual culprit, some army goon lacking foresight into the habits of spiders.  The filmmakers, no doubt from desperation, also went with the whole secret conspiracy angle, something about a PROJECT that got out of hand (some mumbo jumbo about outer space, weapons, and webs).  Quarantine was evoked and some yahoos ran around killing anyone deemed to know too much..........as though a trail of bodies wouldn't be the least bit suspicious (what did they all have in common)!  What a hoot.

I was definitely hesitant to buy this movie based on the spate of disgruntled reviews posted here.  Fortunately, I threw caution to the wind, decided it was a spider movie, so how bad could it be?  I'm glad I ignored the negative and went with the positive.  This movie suits me just fine.  Obviously though, it's not for everyone.",1369526400,11,1740,4.86734693877551

5462477,3,B00AO06N5M,"Having read most of these reviews, I'd like to mention some aspects of the film no one else did. The mad Russian scientist was only vaguely Russian, but that's ok. Like any good mad scientist, he loved his creations. ""You are so beautiful"" he effuses right before the Mega Queen spears him through and through. He doesn't seem to mind this, since he is so happy his experiments came to a successful end. Pretty amusing. Also, I thought there were two daughters, one of whom gets eaten in the worst possible way. No one mentioned her after, not least her parents, or any of you reviewers.  I thought that was odd. Anyway, sometimes the spiders would grow too big as they did what they do. A three foot tall spider doesn't become 6 feet tall just because it jumps on some hapless guy. We also have the incredible shrinking and the later gets bigger again Queen spider. Not good. What about the fact that the spiders were crossed with alien DNA? This would have been good to explore, but no one ever mentions it again. Since the aliens were found on a crashed spacecraft, maybe they weren't that smart after all, so their intelligence had no effect on the spiders. I dunno. On the plus side, the affection of the Mad Scientist for the spiders is almost touching. Also, the acting was ok, except for the younger daughter, who was pretty good. Too bad though that at certain moments she seemed almost casual about trying to evades angry arachnids. As I said, the film is uneven. I loved the tap-tippet-tap of little and not so little spider feet, and I'm willing to overlook the fact that spiders don't have queens. It wasn't that gory, which I liked since I'm sick of all these 'Saw' wannabe flicks that are so nasty I have to stop the movie. (I guess I'm a bit of a wimp.) Good story, ,though, and good pacing. It's good that things started slowly and then sped up gradually. It made this flick different. CGI was good too. An uneven flick, but break out the popcorn and enjoy.

Can't really judge actors, since I've heard some of the speeches before, in other movies. Everything is predictable, even the family reunion.

Admittedly, I'm a sucker for spider flicks whether they be giant or not. ""Kingdom of the Spiders"" remains one of my all time favorite nature amok films. The only problem with the film is that it's a little too middle-of-the-road. It's not campy enough to just sit back and laugh at it, yet it's also not serious enough to evoke true chills. None of the acting is terrible, but neither is anyone going to win any awards. With a little more talent behind the scenes we may have gotten a new cult classic, but everyone decided to play it safe. It's worth a watch if you're curious, but I suspect most people will be turned off by its slow burn premise. It does take nearly an hour before things really kick into gear.

My advice? Wait for the Blu-Ray/DVD price to come down then by all means snatch this one up.",1367452800,,926,4.291428571428572

The true origin of the spiders is revealed 35 minutes into the film.

The special effects are low to mid grade CG. While there was always something going on, the film seemed hollow as if it needed another subplot of someone besides our lone family and the military.

It is a science fiction monster movie not a drama like Godzilla. The creators of the film got straight to the point, and they knew exactly what they wanted.

New York City is threatened to be overrun and it's up to health inspector Rachel Cole & her ex to prevent the Queen Spider from uniting with her eggs and creating a full on army of five foot tall, killer spiders.

I agree...why all the hate for this movie, people? You have to hand it to Director Tibor Takacs for trying his hand at some old-school creature feature type fun. For this to be his first effort in this area, I think he did quite admirably. Not only that but the 3-D was too bad at all. Sure, you can tell it was made on a limited budget but it's far from being a B-movie(by my standards, anyhow, and I've seen quite a few).

However, I will admit that there are a few instances where there missed opportunities in the movie that would have put the movie above its' current status(like not having enough spider carnage going on or having a major BIG showdown with the Queen at the end). Course, with how the movie ends, there's a good possibility that we'll see a part 2 and they could do that in that movie. Given all the giant monster movies coming out over the next year or so(Jack the Giant Slayer, Pacific Rim, Godzilla..); they ought to capitalize on it...for sure...and make one.

Christa Campbell, Patrick Muldoon, Willaim Hope and Sydney Campbell Sweeney put in excellent performances. I really liked the movie. It was a good one.",1363564800,,1452,4.513307984790875
5462493,2,B00AO06N5M,"I won't give any spoilers away, I simply want to talk about the movie in general.

I would place this movie one star above a SyFy Channel movie only in the fact that the script and effects are somewhat better. The acting on the other hand is very, very bad as many have noted in other reviews. The lead actress just can't act. She's very bland in delivering her lines even in life and death situations. Her emotions are way off and so is her disoriented look. Her acting matches someone they might have just pulled off the street and told them ""Here...say this then look left and right."" If they had a better lead actress and a couple more weeks in editing (there are continuity issues) this flick might have been better.

As for the 3D, the film itself is a conversion with an overlay of computer generated 3D effects so it is a strain on your eyes. There is very little pop-out-at-you-effects. It's mostly a depth thing. I had a headache after watching it.

It is a watchable film but you grow weary of wondering why they couldn't have done better with such great sets and that makes the film seem like 3 hours instead of 90 minutes.

Should I have bought it? Probably not. Will I watch it again? I doubt it. That's a bummer because I LOVE the plot and premise of the movie.

It could have been so much better.",1363564800,,1312,4.338775510204082
5462494,5,B00AO06N5M,"I'm really shocked at all the negitive reviews on this movie. Even more so on the 3D part. It was actually really good 3D and it was even shot in 3D!!! There were plenty of pop outs in this movie so again I'm pretty shocked at all the low reviews. This movie brings every thing it advertises. Giant spider and smaller spiders making a mess of New York....Check  Fun cheesy scifi style creature feature....double check......and fun 3D which makes this a fun view......triple check.

The 3d--- as i said before the 3D in this movie was really good. Almost every scene there was a lot of depth between it's objects and there actors. There are plenty of scenes when there are people in the subway and in the apartment buildings that really gives you a good sense of how long down the halls and subway tunnels are. There are plenty of pop outs too. My girlfriend and I counted at least 14-16 pops outs which isn't bad at all for an hour twenty some thing movie. I own a lot of 3D movies and I have seen a lot worse. Safe to say My girlfriend and I were both shocked at how reviewers were saying the 3D was horrible. It was better than any of the Marvel 3d movies that were made and that is no joke either. I even lent it to two of my friends who are scifi nuts and they loved it.

The movie itself is the same old scifi creature feature story really nothing new there and I won't bore you with that cause I'm sure you have probably read the description for this movie already. It wasn't a bad movie by any means and I didn't think the acting was as bad as a lot of these other reviewers were saying. Haven't they ever seen Frogs or Camel spiders!!!! (just kidding no offense to the makers of those 2 movies) Picture quality was good and so was the audio. I have a 5.1 surround sound at home and was very happy with what i got from it.

Please note: I'm not hateing on the negitive reviewers on here by any means. I just don't get or see what it is they are claiming. I know 3D effcets every one a bit diffent but this movie was very solid on it's 3D. Maybe it was the way they viewed it purhaps. I watched it on my LG 47 inch 3d TV (passive style) and as said thought it was a very solid 3D movie. I urge you to go into this movie and give it a fair try.

5462495,3,B00AO06N5M,"this movie was shot in 3d. It was not postproduction put into 3d. The 3d is awesome in this one. The movie is a low budget flick for sure , and it was made in bulgaria. I would have personally have liked to see the movie take place in bulgaria and have them speak english, instead of trying to make it new york. there is a audience for films that take place in other countries as long as you have them speak english most of us english speakers will find it to be ok.  The cgi runs from very good on all the smaller space spiders to pretty good on the giant one. It's not a big budget flick though and the bulgarians did what they could. The plot about bad military dudes could have been skipped though , I would have rather seen the military as the good guys mainly. And the parts where they battle the spiders is pretty good. I would say to ignore the one star comments about bad acting and bad 3d. The acting is ok and the 3d is great on most shots.  Because they used 3d cameras for the movie!. So it's native 3d all the way. In 2d this is less a movie for sure and a standard low budgeter, but the budget was better than a saturday scy fy tv movie by some large degree. Like I said the cgi on the smaller spiders was very realistic. The big one , well it's close to sci fi channel level. Still the movie moves fast and will be a one star for non lovers of cheap sci fi flicks for sure. I don't rate sci fi and horror on the same scale as other movies. On the low budget scale of sci fi this is a three star flick. On the scale of all other movies you just can't rate it against them.  But the 3d is excellent here. The picture is good too.

5462496,4,B00AO06N5M,"It's a shame this movie had to have been released in theaters in this day and age. Had it come out in the 90's it would have been more well received, and typical of the creature features of the time: LAKE PLACID, ANACONDA, DEEP BLUE SEA, THE RELIC, etc. If it had premiered on SyFy it would be considered their greatest made-for-TV movie ever. Unfortunately, neither happened, so I can easily see why it let many people down. It's a creature feature stuck in limbo. It's too good for SyFy, but not good enough to play in today's theaters. The spider effects are quite good, while the occasional digital rat would have looked OK ten years ago.

The budget does not allow for the massive scale attack on the populace of New York that people were hoping for. Instead the city is evacuated before the spiders surface (at the climax) so it's just a handful of civilians and the military that are left. Judging it as a low budget typical creature feature it's great. As a theatrically released spiders-attack-New York movie from 2012 it's a major disappointment. I give it four stars because I like creature features, even SyFy originals, and it is better than any of the direct-to-video/made-for-TV movies I've seen. A direct-to-disc release would have turned it into a cult hit, instead of the flop it is now considered. Fans of this stuff should really give it a chance, but forget how recently it played in theaters.

5462499,1,B00AO06N5M,"Review based on theatrical 3D screening of movie.  3D comments will apply to 3D BluRay across the board.  Possible spoilers!  I've described the set-up but didn't divulge details of the last two-thirds.

Anyone ever notice that NuImage/Millenium--despite being able to squeeze high production-value from every ruble, rand, or rupee they spend in Eastern Europe--just does not, to save them, possess the skill to properly structure a story?

And because they now grind-out these burgers in Bulgaria, have you noticed there's always too many hard-nosed Eastern-Euro military types?  Feels like either the KGB or Israeli Army green-lights their output.

Well, here we have another giant spider movie that, in & of itself, shouldn't be all that bad.  It should provide some fun.  Unfortunately, you can smell a recurring ""Aroma de Boaz"" that chronically stinks-up what could be an otherwise decent tale.

Of course if this gobbler theatrically fails, as long as they've shown a monster before the first possible commercial break, the NuImage boys can pawn it off on a tasteless canned fella at SyFy and recoup an eighth of their $4 million budget.

So here we have SPIDERS 3-D--which, to be honest, should be titled SPIDERS 2.25-D since there is just not enough depth in the film to qualify it as 3D at all.

This film is actually a remake of the Boaz Davison-written 2000 rip-off called SPIDERS.  Like the original film, a satellite holding a genetic experiment falls back to earth--only, this time, landing in New York City...or, more accurately, onto the same three block Bulgarian NY backlot set that we will see over & over.

The normal tarantula-sized subjects scuttle out of their wrecked cylinder and quickly start ravaging the denizens of the NY subway system--starting with rats and then working their way up to a hapless subway worker within whose body they plant their queen's egg!

Then, of course, the spiders (bred in a zero-gravity orbit, mind you) begin growing to considerable size...for no reason.

Cut to the subway system manager, Jason (Patrick Muldoon), examining the dead worker's sliced open corpse.  The female coroner hands him a vial containing the eggs she found within the body to give to Jason's estranged wife Rachel (Christina Campbell)--who just happens to be with the NYC health dept--to examine.

Is this making any sense?  (Hey, ya know, even their mobile phones seem to work well when deep within the NY subway all through the film too.)

Look, a satellite crashes into the NY subway system, and an organism is found and the local authorities--not the feds--seem to be the ones in charge, making very lax decisions about it all.

It's all a set-up to place the dark-haired Jason & dark-haired Rachel and their blonde-haired 13 year-old daughter, Emily, in jeopardy from the evil military complex wanting to harvest the spiders--because, of course, the beasts are some kind of old genetic joint US-Soviet (I guess?) weapon experiment gone wrong.

Then the rest of the film is a chase within what are supposed to be big scale pyrotechnics--all as the big spiders break loose from their secured compound and wreak havoc on the civilians and the now-arrived scientists & military.  So, set the now-sought-after-by-the-military family members trying to reunite themselves amidst all that chaos and that's really all there is.

The problem starts with this movie's very concept and carries over into a horribly illogical screenplay.  Just because it's supposed to be B-picture SciFi is no excuse.  Similar movies from the 1950's possessed far more story logic.  Allowing one scientific lie as a McGuffin, this story is still supposedly set in the real world and it therefore needs to follow real logic to get us to care.  It doesn't, and we don't.

Don't blame the cast.  They're working as hard as their plastic-surgeoned faces will allow.  It's just that most of them are miscast.  The only standout is Sydney Sweeney as Emily--who actually manages to engage genuine audience sympathy.

The long focal length lenses, the too-reduced Inter-Axial setting on the 3D rig (leading to the kind of weak depth the blind execs at SkyChannel will surely approve), the half-polarized reflections appearing in one eye but not the other (an absence of a quarter-wave retarder over the Freestyle rig's face) and the not-so-steady-steadicam too-frequently used for too many shots, all belie the fact that the director wasn't experienced in shooting-for nor staging-in 3D.

Oh, BTW, the flick is color-graded in an overall cold de-saturated bluish-tone.  Ugly and hard on the eyes.

The CG FX are varied.  Modeling, animation, & lighting are very good.  But the compositing in 3D leaves a lot to be desired, with elements frequently missing correct placement along the z-axis (almost only counts in house-shoes and hand-genades, folks).

In fact, considering that I noticed a credit for ""The Hive"" in the end-crawl, I suspect that much of this picture's 3D was salvaged from one 2D view by that clever Moscow-based conversion shop.

Oh, I forgot to mention, in the story, the spiders are supposed to have been cross-bred with some kind of space-alien DNA, so they're designed with slightly anthropomorphic faces--having eyes that blink and a set of teeth, no less (reminding me of the demonic faces laughably pasted onto the twisters in NuImage's 2005 SyFy movie TORNADO).

And while there's a fair dose of toned-down gore, it's never really explained why the spiders tear-open their victims.  Like, it's not exactly apparent that they're dining on them though, logically, they should be.  More egg-planting, I guess.

If you like giant-bug movies, there are far better ones to recommend--like the original THEM (1954).

However, if you don't mind a wretched script masquerading behind a frenetic, faux-stylish shakycam fest, then, by all means, watch SPIDERS 2.25-D.  But I wouldn't recommend it in 3D, because there's just no depth to pay an extra penny for.

Possibly worth a cheap Redbox rental, but hurry `cause Coinstar will recycle the disks as coasters or clay pigeons after a few day's play.  VOD?  Well, wait for the bargain of Subscription-VOD availability on Netflix.",1363046400,3,6193,5.108349900596422

5462501,1,B00AO06N5M,"Films featuring giant rampaging bugs have been a staple in American cinema since the 1950s.  Playing on the paranoid, Cold War era of the time these creatures were often the result of nuclear testing gone awry.  But most of these films, certainly the best ones, were campy at their cores and they knew it.  This made them fun then and most of them remain so today.  We get no such campy fun in Spiders.  This disheveled bore-fest starts with a ridiculous premise and ends with a silly mess of a military vs. giant spider battle that makes you long for the days of films like 1955's Tarantula.

A Russian satellite, launched in the 1980s and filled with venomous spiders is struck by a meteor which sends it crashing into the New York City subway.  But how a satellite filled with spiders managed to survive close to 30 years in space isn't nearly as silly as why they were put there to begin with.  Soon dozens of little spiders are crawling around and chasing the rats out of the subway and into the streets.  The section of the city where the satellite crashed is quarantined by the U.S. military under the false story of a viral outbreak.

In reality the military, led by Colonel Jenkins (William Hope of Aliens), is working with a Russian scientist to harvest the eggs of the spiders, in particular the Queen.  Seems the Russians discovered an extra-terrestrial craft in the 1980s and spliced alien DNA with that of a spider and launched them into orbit because apparently the lack of gravity makes them grow when they return or some such hooey.  In any case the queen is capable of spinning an ""infinite"" amount of silk that is stronger than the most durable Kevlar and also provide stealth abilities.  Now this is never touched on again in the film and in fact on several occasions we see characters easily cut through the silk.

Trapped within the quarantined area is the daughter of Jason and Rachel Cole.  He is a supervisor with the Transit Authority and she is a doctor with the Health Department.  As they try to sneak through the barriers to get through to their daughter, the spiders soon grow to massive sizes, quickly over-running the soldiers.  The queen grows even larger, Several stories tall and long as she rampages through the streets battling the army.

Part of what made those 1950s fun was that the plots were simple.  Radioactivity turns bugs big...bugs go on a rampage...military kills bugs.  But Spiders mucks up that simple notion with all this silliness about alien DNA and super silk.  It's blatantly obvious the film was shot on some studio back lot.  Even though the military has quarantined several blocks the only resident seems to be the Cole's daughter.  The actors look downright embarrassed and bored to be in the production.  The CGI is the kind of quality you'd expect to find in the average SyFy channel production, i.e., bad!  For some reason the spiders seem to have these almost cartoonish faces on them.  And while the Army throws everything they have at the Queen including helicopter gunships, tanks, bazooka's and dozens of soldiers with armored weapons, they don't make a dent yet Jason Cole is able to fend her off at one point armed with nothing other than a pole.  The giant spider film makes one giant splat!
