Another obscure entry to emerge during this same year was Franco Prosperi's ""the Throne of Fire,"" and it too was a starring vehicle for a luscious Italian babe to be blessed with a gorgeous body and striking mane of blonde hair, one Sabrina Siani.  If you can't already tell, I'm a fan of hers, and am trying to collect all of her works from her early '80s peak era, so when I saw ""the Throne of Fire"" VHS being offered on Amazon and her featured prominently on its cover, I couldn't pass it up.

The story concerns a prophecy in which in order for one to inherit the Throne of Fire, which is literally a chair that will set you on fire if you're not the rightful heir to it, you must also marry Princess Valkari (Sabrina), to ultimately gain control and rule the land.  A woman is raped early on (though thankfully it's only implied) by one of the devil's messengers, and her bastard offspring evolves into Harrison Muller, who also appeared with Sabrina in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2020-Texas-Gladiators/dp/B000MGHAN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2020 Texas Gladiators</a>, another favorite of mine from around the same time.  Muller becomes an evil antagonist intent on usurping the throne and forcibly marrying Sabrina in the process.  The only force of good that stands in his way is the upright warrior Siegfried (Peter McCoy), who battles Muller to stop him from carrying out his plan and to see that peace prevails.

I previously reviewed Sabrina's other aforementioned sword flick from the same year ""the Invincible Barbarian"" on Amazon and ended up giving it four stars, if only for the presence of a number of gorgeous Italian women on display wearing next to nothing, or in Sabrina's case, nothing at all.  Other than a couple decomposing faces and a charbroiled corpse however, ""the Throne of Fire"" is strictly PG-rated fare; that is to say, no skin is bared.  It has the feeling of a movie that might have been shown as a Saturday afternoon matinee in the mid-'80s on your local low-power UHF station.  It also has the feeling of being a real quickie job culled from leftover sets and props from other movies, and it probably was.

That said, Sabrina looks stunning as always waving a sword around, so other fans of her might want to check this out.  But overall I can't quite recommend it based on its other merits alone and therefore is one for completists only.",1319932800,7,3257,5.516064257028113
