This is an XXX Adult Movie that has been filmed from different angles as not to show penetration and such. A Softcore movie is simulated sex, this is not simulated sex, just filmed from a different angle. Some things still slip through from time to time if you look close enough.

It's exactly what I wanted so I am a happy customer. I'd like to have more like this but these are difficult to find and I prefer this over Softcore or full Hardcore. It's an in-between.

Don't expect any plot or dialog, ""Behind Closed Doors With Jennifer Luv"" is a compilation of scenes from various movies she has done. Of course, how many of you really care about a plot or story anyway, right?.",1397347200,,789,4.390410958904109
