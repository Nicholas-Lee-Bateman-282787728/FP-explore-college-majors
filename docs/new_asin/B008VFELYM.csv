5185050,3,B008VFELYM,"""Beyond spectacular at first as a concept but then turned its direction for better and worse when I finally seen this film. Berberian Sound Studio, directed by Peter Strickland, follows a timid British man named Gilderoy (Toby Jones) working through the process of an Italian horror film, Il vortice equestre (The Equestrian Vortex).

The film takes much of its perspective on the complications, paranoia, and fear of the project and does not go out of its way to explain some of the ambiguity and confusion in the set but reflect, in a naturalistic kind of way, of the subjects recording their voices, making noises, editing the work, or hearing things. Complex to say the least as the version seen accidentally forgotten subtitles for clarity and the film's means to present its content leave you to wonder if the whole thing is a dream or a vivid hallucination when Gilderoy sleeps in the countryside. A note of concern to those who think that this is may not be scary, the film is more frightening and twisty when one thinks what is through Gilderoy's mind and hearing the sound of violence and suffering through the horror film (which is never shown) in the film. This trait makes it more dynamic than the average horror or thriller film you get from Hollywood (The Ring, Paranormal Activity). Need we say more?

While flawed, inconsistent, and rather drab at parts, the process of how Jones portrays his character, some of the surrealism, and mechanics of sound design are just enough to slightly recommended this for nighttime, experimental viewing.""",1369526400,,1557,4.916349809885932
5185051,4,B008VFELYM,"This is many ways is paying homage to those seventies horror films that are really in a genre all of their own. The studio of the title is where unassuming sound engineer, Gilderoy (Toby Jones `Harry Potter') arrives. He has only done nature films and children's television before but as this is called `The Equestrian Vortex' he assumes it is a horsey thing. When he questions the enigmatic director Santini (Antonio Mancino) he is told `this is not a horror film, it is a Santini film! So he gets on with the job in hand.

The problem is that the men helping him are at most barely cognisant or one is totally hostile. He decides to plod on and the cast are far from fan boys themselves. We see an array of vegetables getting smashed, dropped, ripped apart or stabbed to the flickering reflection coming from the studio screen. Our senses are heightened still further by the use of the sound board, so we know what is taking place on the unseen screen as say a witch is having her hair pulled out or a multiple stabbing is taking place as an unsuspecting cabbage get the `Psycho' shower scene treatment.

All of this is taking place amidst the seeming constant background noise of screaming. As the film gets more and more to Gilderoy, the more his reality seems to get mixed up in the happenings of the film. I also noticed that there is a tension both actual and sexual that is volatile through out and I think as most of the action takes place in the studio, this gives it a claustrophobic hue which adds to both a feeling of intimacy and immediacy.

This is a film that will stay with you, not only will you never look at a vegetable quite the same way again, but it has a power to come back into your mind for some time afterwards. I really liked it but almost exhaled in relief when it ended, which on reflection is some achievement for a film that rolls just over an hour and a half. In Italian and English with sub titles in all the right places. For fans of Italian horror as this makes a brilliant companion piece and for people who like films off the beaten path this is one to add to your collection.",1359849600,3,2114,4.3604060913705585

5185056,2,B008VFELYM,"From the beginning, this film underwhelms at every turn.  A sound man arrives in Italy and discovers what it is like to work with Italians - they are rude, manipulative con men who despise women.  (Having lived in Italy, I think this is sadly accurate.)  An ongoing plot line is that he is trying to get reimbursed for his flight, but no one will help him.  If that sounds idiotically mundane, it is.  Being a nice guy, he can't cope and gets more and more stressed as the production hits roadblock after roadblock. So?

Even worse, there is no fundamental mystery at the heart of it, nothing to figure out, he is just having a bad work experience.  There simply is no psychological pressure that builds, indeed nothing really seems to be happening and nothing does.  How can this be a cult favorite?  HOw could it have won awards?  I am truly at a loss to find anything good to say about it, except that the actors are good, even if the script is completely lacking.

Not recommended.",1448409600,,985,4.477528089887641

5185058,4,B008VFELYM,"A fabulous film (or two depending upon your point of view)  for filmmakers or anyone who really enjoys studying films on an analytical level.

What you have is 132 minutes of the camera following the slow mental deterioration of a gentle but easily intimidated Milquetoast, who finds himself trapped into mixing the sound for a Italian Giallo (slasher/horror) film.

The movie that we find ourselves watching actually has very little plot, no music soundtrack and minimal sound effects other then dialogue. It does not even have its own opening title other then a sign in in a dimly lit hall.

The soundtrack and much of the sound effects we hear throughout the 132 minutes of The Berberian Sound Studio actually belongs to an entirely different movie called The Equestrian Vortex - a repugnant, nightmarish thriller we never actually get to see (other then it's opening credits).

The effect of watching the frames of one film with the soundtrack from another completely shades the viewers emotions, where the most mundane or innocent things (such as reading a sweet letter from Mum, setting a daddy-long-legs free or dicing a cabbage) may become disturbing, foreboding, frightening, repulsive, or suspenseful.  Scenes of inappropriate behavior, or intimidation around the unhealthy studio become close to nightmarish.

One of the many effects of putting the sound effects and soundtrack from one movie to the visuals of another, is that it puts the viewer inside the head of the squeamish protagonist. It allows us to sense his dilemma as this nice guy attempts to get along at a dysfunctional work place. (haven't we all been there at least once in out lives) In many ways the viewer shares the sound-man's state of mind as he slowly looses his grip on reality. Is the producer insulting him? are the pretty voice-actress's warnings real? Is she coming on to him?, is the creepy director getting to familiar?, is a secretary ignoring him?,  is he going to get paid? and what is the Equestrian Vortex he is forced to endure if not a horror film?  Or maybe its all in his mind, or it's all simply due to cultural barriers and language issues?  As our sound-man becomes confused by the mixed messages, so is the viewer.  The viewer's confusion, in this case, is being assisted by the overlapping movie soundtracks and visual slights of hand..

The following is one example of the mixed signals you can expect, its the opening title credits, of which there are none!  When Berberian Sound Studio begins, the only hint of the title is a dimly lit sign at the top of the screen in the office hallway.  Yet we see credits roll, and if your not paying attention, they may seem to be the credits for the film we are going to see.  In reality the credits are not for the film the viewer is about to see, they are the credits for a film that that the viewer is about to hear. Confused yet?  The effect is that you believe you are going to see a certain type of horror film, but you aren't, and like allot of what goes on in this film - it has to be teased out and analyzed otherwise you have just been influenced into a mood, you are ill-prepared and expecting the wrong thing , just like our soundman.  It's easy to miss, and that is part of the game and the genius of the film.  Its these subtle and easily overlooked visual and aural tricks that play on our emotions and beliefs that make The Berberian Sound Studio such a challenging and rewarding film to experience.

The Berberian Sound Studio is not for everyone and it is not a horror film, although it is horrifying in its own way. The  Berberian Sound Studio is more like a study of a deteriorating personality, similar to films like Bergmann's Persona or Hour Of The Wolf.  In the case of Berberien Sound Studio, its seems that this protagonist will come to identify with his ""torturers"" at the expense of his identity.

Know that Berberian Sound Studio is both a beautiful and ingenious film but it is also an unpleasant one and the film's lack of plot, final moments and subjective conclusion may not be satisfying for many.

But, if you really love one of a kind, original films that mix exceptional film-making  techniques  with psychology (and with more then a nod to Giallo movies), then the Berberian Sound Studio is not to be missed.  The film is re-watchable and like a good painting takes on new layers and deeper meaning with each viewing.",1437350400,,4403,4.663648124191462

5185062,1,B008VFELYM,"You should know that this film is anti-horror film. It is explicit in the dialogue from the male characters (who are all jerks), and if you doubt it you can find more proof in the extras, where the production team basically say that horror films are about taking pleasure in the misery of others, specifically women. I doubt you could find many horror fans who would assert that these films advocate violence against women. Violence is the horror film's subject, not its argument. Here the main character is driven mad by giving voice to the cruelty in a film about witchcraft - a ridiculous premise, as is the idea that a tech would be imported to work on a film he doesn't want to work on. The most pointlessly sadistic scare films usually aim at the lowest common denominator  - cheap thrills - and fall off the radar, since even 'monster movie' fans can spot junk. An argument could be made that sadism is connected to the field of horror, but you won't find it here. This film just states that men who make horror films hate women, and brings down the curtain. But they want to celebrate the pretty ladies and cool fashions of the '70s 'giallo' at the same time. Better make up your mind if you love or hate these films next time.

Just screened the basic DVD of this tonight (a few days after Halloween or thereabouts)

A MASSIVE letdown, although Toby Jones is fabulous in the film,
as one would expect, Berberian just didn't work for me on any but mostly surface
levels, technical, and I love the settings and I'm an audio nut so that makes sense,
but otherwise, if you want a film about someone slowly losing it you go to Polanski's
masterpiece REPULSION, for sure, over this rather pretentious nonsense. It's well-made,
but unbelievably repetitive, predictable, and I'd rather have spent my time
watching the original giallo films and I'm a horror fanatic and I'm not even THAT
big into that many of those films. Some are great, some are just hideously bad. Bava's Black Sunday,
great....Suspiria....fabulously bad dated and overrated. Fulci I never liked at all.

Anyway, just go get some gelato and real giallo (maybe--I had a better time watching
Witchfinder General this Halloween than any of that stuff) instead and forget Berberian Sound Studios.
Another film recommended highly to me, and I wanted to love it but I just couldn't.
I utterly get what Strickland was aiming for, but I don't feel he really succeeded.
He prattles on endlessly on the commentary about musique concrete, utterly obscure
experimental music/noise composers, avant-garde post-modern classical masters like Berio and Nono,
which would be more fascinating if the film itself was that great, which, it's just not.
And I actually know a good deal of Berio and Nono, although I'm more a Morton
Feldman and Iannis Xenakis man, myself. This film should have been titled ""The Director
is a Sadistic Womanizing Badly-Dressed Stand-In For ""X"" giallo director at
Barbarian Sound Studios and Our hapless bemused English sound FX Hero Ends up Going Raving Mad""
and now you don't need to watch this tedious film!

Also, for goodness' sake, a film so all about sound and audio FX and mixing and post-production, or at least, as its basis
and setting, some of the dialogue mixing is ATROCIOUS, confusing and muddy sounding
or even sometimes, inaudible, as with a few of Tobey's comments or asides, although maybe that
was on purpose? I dunno. Bloody irritating. I'll admit it LOOKS great, though, courtesy
of the ARRI digital cameras mentioned in the commentary. And the sdtrk. music is cool
and all.",1415232000,,2416,5.0049751243781095
5185069,3,B008VFELYM,"Builds to an eerie and spooky end, but a bit confusing. Also, I had the subtitles on because some people are speaking Italian,and suddenly towards the last third of the movie it switched to a dubbed version;weird!",1414108800,,213,4.783783783783784
5185070,1,B008VFELYM,"Wow, when I originally read reviews for this movie I really had high hopes. I am a big fan of giallo movies and euro-horror. I love Bava, Argento, Fulci and Franco and have seen many of the key recommended giallo films of the 70s. This is none of it. It doesn't even work on a reconstructed, subverted or meta level - because NOTHING happens in the movie. There is no central mystery to solve, there are no murders, there is no conspiracy. Midway thru when you are CRAVING some type of plot point or scene which would propel the narrative or give you a clue as to where the movie is taking you - you ask yourself, ""Is this just about Toby Jones slowing losing his mind?"" AND IT IS. Although you don't particularly have a clue as to why he's losing it. And him cracking up never leads to any kind of explosion of violence, denouement or cathartic release for the audience. There is a trying too hard to be clever ""switch"" one hour into the movie to lend it some kind of credibility by trying to put it in the company of Mulholland Drive, Persona or 3 women. But there is no underlying logic to it. What this movie has going for it is sound design and cinematography. But that was completely exhausted in the first 40 minutes. If you want to see another hour and 10 minutes of Toby Jones sliding faders and turning knobs or an actress screaming in a booth for the 10th time - be my guest. Tedious, repetitious and decidedly NOT a tribute to giallo (other than a sly tangental referencing of Suspiria in the movie that is being made within the film). It's a boring indie psychodrama masquerading as an arthouse ""horror"" movie. If you want to see an abstract arthouse tribute to giallo then rent ""AMER,"" a strange, stylish exercise in italian thriller subversion. (Although it has flaws, too!) Last thing, there is not one character to empathize or identify with in the movie. Every character is pretty much unlikeable.",1405209600,,1915,4.489971346704871
5185071,4,B008VFELYM,"Nine Things about the Movie Berberian Sound Studio [Britain, 2012]

1. This mindbender is a movie about making a movie. Its partly a drama, and partly a tribute to the giallo films of the 1970s. Its by a fairly new director, Peter Strickland.

2. Its about a shy, introverted foley artist (thats the guy in charge of sound effects in movies) named Gilderoy that makes a trip to Italy to work on a film that he thinks is about horses. Gilderoy discovers the movie is actually a horror movie, and he is responsible for making the torture and killing scenes sound realistic. This does not sit well with the more peaceful nature of Gilderoy, and he has trouble doing it.

3. The producer and director of the horror film are rude, egotistical, and sexist. Their behavior gets progressively worse. The horror scenes get more extreme. Gilderoy is feeling more stressed and uncomfortable.

4. Eventually, his reality begins to crack. He starts to become detached, and the boundaries of his life get fuzzy. And then, well, its hard to explain what happens next. He seems to slowly become fictionalized. His life transforms, in bits and pieces, into the movie hes working on. I think.

5. While the movie being made is a horror film, we never see any of it. The director of the real film, Strickland, reverses everything. Instead of seeing the various tortures and murders being depicted, we just witness the ways in which the various sounds of it are created. This makes the movie quite educational.

6. Fans of 1970s Italian giallo directors like Argento and Fulci will appreciate the camera work and the soundtrack of this movie (and the one in it).

7. As you might suspect, this movie is all about the sound. Pay attention to how and when sound is created, used, and repeated. They provide one of the few clues to what is actually going on.

8. Its hard to say if the movie actually means anything, or if it is just a Twilight Zone-ish head scratcher. If Strickland is trying to say something deeper about movies, or life, or whatever, it probably comes from the fact that the killers in giallo films stereotypically wore black gloves and a trenchcoat. Look for where that shows up in this film.

9. This is an impressive film for the director, who had only made one film before this, with his uncles inheritance money. Its a creative, strange tale of movies and madness. And lots of garden vegetables.",1403308800,,2397,4.67458432304038

5185074,4,B008VFELYM,"BERBERIAN SOUND STUDIO is a truly unique film. Strange, beautiful, haunting and just plain weird, it will never have mass appeal, but it probably isn't intended to. Rather it will interest fans of psychological horror, Italian 70s horror, and techno geeks who will go gaga at the sight of so many obsolete Revox tape recorders and miles and miles of quarter inch tape.

The film also has at its core the wonderful Toby Jones, who is fast becoming a character actor with an awful lot of leading roles under his belt. His star turn as Truman Capote a few years ago in Infamous blew Philip Seymour Hoffmans performance right out of the water. Jones is wonderful here (as he usually is) and draws the viewer into his increasingly distorted mental state with consummate skill and subtlety. This is no mean feat considering much of his screen time consists of adjusting sound levels, looking perplexed at the odd assortment of people around him and reacting in growing discomfort at the images for which he is recording horrific sound effects. Wisely, we never see the footage for The Equestrian Vortex, the fictional film Jones is sound-scaping. The constant shrieking, screaming, stabbing and bludgeoning sounds are like a cacophonous symphony of horror. Images would diminish their effectiveness. Filmmaker Strickland well recognizes the power of the audiences imagination.

The film is full of eccentricities, from voice artists who babble incoherently to a near parody of the self-important Italian film director who considers himself an artist (dont call my film a Horror Movie!), to a strange set of letters Gilderoy receives from his mother that seem to portend his fate. Jones tries to take it all in stride but his discomfort is established from the get go when he fails to received reimbursement for the cost of his flight to Italy. Clearly a fish out of water, despite his considerable reputation as a sound artist, Jones fights an uphill battle all the way.

The extra features provide little in the way of insight, apart from the directors commentary. Even so, BERBERIAN SOUND STUDIO is a difficult film to sit through twice. Its worth seeing, however, for the strangeness of its setting and particularly Jones performance.",1397433600,3,2231,5.024324324324325

5185076,4,B008VFELYM,"Toby Jones is superb in a role much different from what he is usually called upon to do. This blackly comic, disturbing, disorienting, and very smartly written and directed film makes knowing use of Italian horror/giallo without actually being ABOUT film making in Italy at all. It's more like film making in some forgotten, out-of-time part of the subconscious mind. And it's about being British in a strange land, suppressing passion and emotion in a time, place, and profession where passion reigns supreme. It's nightmarish. But it is not a horror film.

Its surreal and hallucinatory, like in the good old days. But what really makes this movie a very special thing is how sound is both featured and employed. Films are primarily visual. Well, this one is visual too BUT its more of an auditory film and none that I can think can even compare. In that regard, this film deserves a lot of credit.  The acting is strong across the board. The lead actor, while familiar to me as an actor, really made me believe his character. The atmosphere was ominous and foreboding, claustrophobic as well. I found it more cerebral than visceral horror, though there was tension. This is a noteworthy film and imo, a contemporary classic.",1391817600,,837,4.655405405405405
5185081,2,B008VFELYM,"British Foley artist Gilderoy (Toby Jones) goes to Italy to work in a movie.

Second, the people in the studio treat him very rudely, and no one wants to reimburse him for the plane ticket he took from London to Italy. As things get more and more strange, one starts to realize that some of the things going on might be just him dreaming

This film is meant to be a homage to the atmospheric Italian horror movies of the 70s, the so called giallos. I haven't seen many of those, but I have seen Dario Argentos Deep Red (1975) and Suspiria (1977) and they are great movies. Also, there are not a lot of movies whose main character works as a sound technician (the only one who comes to my mind is Brian de Palmas Blow Out). The acting is fine (Toby Jones is perfect as the meek, mousy, probably virginal middle aged Gilderoy and so is Cosimo Fusco as the very rude engineer Francesco). The direction is OK too. The only thing this film lacks is a decent plot, or any comprehensible plot for that matter. A conventional killer loose in the studio script would probably have suffice to make this films pass the grade.

Being one of the UK's best audio mixers and Foley Artist extraordinaire, he was personally chosen and hired by the legendary Italian director, Signor Santini, as the chief sound engineer for his new film - but it's not a horror film, it's a ""Santini film"".

Mr Gilderoy is unknowingly about to enter a new dimension of sight and sound, of mind and perception, of fear and imagination, a trip into - ""The Berberian Sound Studio Zone"".  (I miss that guy!)  Yes, I was also swept away by this 'sonic tsunami' which gradually yet inexorably unfolded and ultimately crescendoed, leaving me on one hell of a frightening ride!

The film is well paced with a gradual ramping up of tension and towards the end it gets gets very strange. As well as being an entertaining story it's also an interesting watch. His job is to recreate the sounds of various nasty scenes, the techniques he uses to achieve these make for an interesting watch in themselves.

Another aspect I enjoyed was the lack of shock or visual horror, apart from a few glimpses it's all in the audio and not in a surprise fashion, in places it is downright creepy, which always get's my vote!

5185088,5,B008VFELYM,"Berberian Sound Studio (Peter Strickland, 2012)

I saw Berberian Sound Studio in a 110-seat theatre. It was a Wednesday matinee, so I expected a light crowd, but I was one of four people in the seats. The conclusion I had reached by the end of the film was that there were one hundred six people who had had the chance to catch a Wednesday afternoon matinee of Berberian Sound Studio and didn't, and there are one hundred six people in this world who are worse for the experience. To make it short: if you are at all a fan of movies, even a casual fan, you can simply forget the actual plot of the film: this is a study in fascination, an endlessly-interesting look at film composition during the golden age of giallo.

It's obvious that everyone involved in the making of this movie eats, sleeps, and breathes giallo, which is one of the things that makes it so effective. It also means that people who are already familiar with the genre may find the movie a little more interesting than the general public, but really, rent yourself a handful of mid-seventies Dario Argento pictures and early-seventies Lucio Fulci pictures to get a basic grounding in the field and you're good to go. (Just in case you actually decide to follow this, grab Profondo Rosso--the 126-minute cut released by Anchor Bay, not the horrific 89-minute piece of butchery that landed in American theatres--Four Flies on Grey Velvet, Don't Torture a Duckling, and just for the sake of variety, Antonio Bido's The Bloodstained Shadow and Pupi Avati's The House with the Laughing Windows. The last of those, actually, has more parallels in this movie than I realized whilst watching, now that I think about it.) But like I said before, the actual plot of the film takes second stage to the act of putting a movie together, so that's kind of an optional step that will let you soak in more of the movie's amazing atmosphere.

The plot: Gilderoy (The Hunger Games' Toby Jones) is a timid, mild-mannered foley artist from England whose specialty is travel and nature documentaries. (For the uninitiated, a foley artist is the guy who creates and mixes the ambient sounds in a movie--for example, when we see a shot of one of Gilderoy's finished products, there's a sweeping panorama of a British countryside view that has an orchestral soundtrack and some birdsong. The foley artist is the guy who goes out, records the birds, sits down with the footage, and then puts together the music and the birdsong and syncs it all with the visuals. There are a lot of amazing shots of sound storyboards here, and I wish I knew enough about foley work to know what those things are called because I probably sound like an idiot right now, but man, Strickland uses them to great effect here.) Before the film starts, we soon learn, he got a job offer from Italian director Giancarlo Santini (Antonio Mancino in his first feature film, and he looks far less like George Clooney in the movie than he does in his IMDB headshot) to come and do the foley work on Santini's newest ""equestrian"" film--which turns out to be a supernaturally-driven giallo picture called The Equestrian Vortex. The timeframe of the movie is never explicitly stated, but it's obviously meant to be during giallo's golden age, which would put it somewhere between roughly 1971 and 1978. Not that is matters, other than in the costuming, as the entire film takes place in the titular sound studio and Gilderoy's rented flat. Gilderoy, obviously not used to working on such fare, find himself shocked, and not a little grossed out, by the onscreen goings-on, but every time he expresses his misgivings, the producer, an overbearing jerk by the name of Francesco (The Card Player's Cosimo Fusco), browbeats him into submission. He is cowed by the two sound effects guys, Massimo and Massimo (Pal Toth and Josef Szeres, both in their first screen appearances--minor characters, but oh how I loved them, and both have very bright careers ahead of them), who really are kind of scary. In fact, his only real friend on the set seems to be Silvia (Katalin Varga's Fatma Mohamed), one of the film's leading ladies, but even she keeps asking questions that make Gilderoy uncomfortable... questions like why he thinks Santini chose him to work on the movie. The closer the crew gets to finishing the film, the deeper Gilderoy has to reach into himself to hold on to his sense of reality...

SPOILER ALERT: you really should go into this knowing nothing. I tried to reveal as little as possible, but even that may be too much. You have been warned.

I've seen the movie called a horror film and a psychological thriller. I would not consider it either of those things, and I wonder how that mismarketing makes the film play with audiences. There are elements of both, of course--like I said, this is a movie that is steeped in the giallo tradition--but, and I say this at the risk of spoiling the movie, though I will attempt to do so in as minor a way as possible, though I will tell you ""stop reading now and just go see the damn thing!"", ultimately it is yet another character study of a person who is slowly going mad. And yes, I say ""yet another"", because how many movies of that type have we seen since good old Gaslight? But holy crap, Strickland, and let's remember that this is just his second movie (Katalin Varga was his first, and it just rocketed to the top of my must-see list), piles on the style, style, style. To give you one of the movie's less-subtle symbols for Gilderoy's failing grip on reality, the crew use a huge amount of produce to come up with their sound effects; one of the Massimos drops a squash in order to simulate the sound of a body hitting concrete, Gilderoy rips the green tops from bunches of radishes, etc. Francesco provides the crew with a bin to toss all the refuse in (and I did wonder, given the Gilderoy is strapped for cash throughout the movie, why he wasn't just taking all this stuff home and eating it, but honestly, just roll with it here), but he never gets round to emptying it, and every once in a while we cut to that bin and see how much more rotten the vegetables are. And then there's the thing with the daddy longlegs that keeps appearing in Gilderoy's room. (That is not going where you think it is.) But the real killer here is Toby Jones himself. This is a tough role. Gilderoy is balancing any number of emotions on a very fragile beam here, as well as becoming more and more paranoid, but still trying to keep up the air of professionalism that will allow him to finish the movie and get the hell out of Dodge, and Toby Jones is marvelous at depicting this. I wish I could tell you more about some of these scenes, and some of the stylistic choices Strickland makes in the final third of the film that really start bringing it all home, but the less you know about this movie going into it, the better off you will be, and I have already probably said far, far too much here.

Besides, it's all about the sounds anyways. I spent as much time marvelling at the inventive uses of produce in this movie as I did cringing at Gilderoy's timidity. I suspect you will as well. And you know what? I can't believe I got through this entire review without mentioning Berberian Sound Studio's own foley guy. I mean, a movie that's about a foley guy is pretty much guaranteed to have its audience paying more attention to foley than any other movie they've ever seen, and Heiki Kossi--a guy popular enough in the biz that since his career as a foley artist started in 2000, he's racked up almost one hundred fifty credits (on this side of the pond, the most notable is probably the cult horror-comedy Rare Exports)--rises to the occasion. He gets a good deal of help from foley recordist Miia Nevalainen (Kossi's version of Massimo and Massimo!), and man, they do the job. I kept looking for nits to pick in the sound in this movie, and I couldn't find a one. I went into this movie with ridiculously, unrealistically high expectations, and it loved up to them all.

I am just now realizing that sound has played a huge part in three of the last four movies to which I gave five stars--Mary and Max, Eloi Eloi Lema Sabachthani?, and Absentia. Berberian Sound Studio focuses on sound; what do you think is going to happen here? I am one of those guys who is continuously behind the loop where movies are concerned, and to date (I'm writing this on June 26, 2013) I have only seen thirty-nine movies released in 2012; I am having a very hard time believing, even despite that, that 2012 produced a better  movie than Berberian Sound Studio. The fortieth movie, barring a few revisions that got bumped down half a star or so, to which I have ever given five stars. *****",1372204800,14,8738,4.571793235481812

Along the way, it just wanders off...  For me, a bit too ambiguous, and the ending?  Well, the film leaves the interpretation VERY MUCH to the viewer.  Some go for this, I don't.

8530880,5,B008VFELYM,"This movie is about a lot of things.  I see the infinite number of hypothesis on different sites about it (including Amazon) and I see in Toby Jones' Mr. Gilderoy a number of things

1) Someone who is working in a field where he does not belong (aka Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining"".)

2) Someone who is naturally kind but goes slightly bad under pressure.  Every now and then we see that he has worked on children's shows with sound effects and letters from his ""mum"" come. She writes about the hatchlings in her yard and their habits.  He eventually begins hallucinating them?

3)  A deeply religious man who is too uneven in his blend of faith and art.

What is happening, exactly?  Exactly what happened when movies were made during the ""giallo"" period: women had to scream their lungs out in soundboxes and sound effects were crude.  This is a period piece and it reaches the peak of ""Mulholland Drive"" at times.  On a more loner pathos level it is about someone who is not coalescing with his environment.  At all.  Mr. Gilderoy thinks he wants to meet ""the great Santini"", some director who goes along with the trends of this time period and makes campy Witchfinder General stuff while insisting that his film is not ""horror"".  He is immediately shamed and degraded.  He begins hallucinating and looking mighty harrowed.

Both the mind of his fellow sound director and his own mind become threatened under the stress of trying to make a new film after the celluloid for the first is trashed.  Is it a signal they've gone mad officially when each is ushered into the light of a movie screen?  It could be, or a metaphysical symbol of their own demise.  Or maybe he just went nuts.

Refreshingly, director Peter Strickland credited Stereolab as the band that made this movie possible.

You have to appreciate the clashes of culture,the attention to time period detail, the fragile nature of the meek, suppressed English personality,  and literary sublteties, ll mixed in with the most exploitative film cliche's of the splatterhouse 70s. There's no actual horror in this. It's all offscreen gore and moody atmosphere. It's more a dread or opression film than a horror one.

8530885,2,B008VFELYM,"The reviews of any professional critic who lavishes praise on this film or its up-and-coming director -- which seems to be most of them, should forevermore be ignored.  These critics are unable to fulfill the rudimentary aspect of their job junction of competently discerning a solid cinematic outing from an obviously cold dead fish.  This film is a dead fish, laying there lifeless, inert.  It's a dead fish ""dressed up"" with style but a dead fish nonetheless. Berberian Sound Studio is an utterly un-engaging albeit highly stylized art-house flick. So, the film takes place in an Italian sound studio in the 70's where they are working on post production of a horror film (not a ""giallo""!  More on that later...), ""The Equestrian Vortex,"". What tired tropes will be shamelessly served up? As you can likely guess, many unnecessary scenes of audio tape reeling through old school analog Nagra sprockets. (Directors love this stuff... Tired.)  Redundant scenes of actresses screaming in the sound booth?  Check.  Redundant scenes of actors reciting dialog doing ADR and Foley work?  Check. Casting call left/front/right ""quick cuts""? Check.  The flickering projector lights of the screening room?  Check.  Strickland couldn't even resist the ole projector bulb burning a hole on the film frame trope.  Also, this is in no way the ""homage to giallos"" I had read. The film they're working on is not even a ""giallo"".  It is a horror film -- two entirely different genres. Note to bad film reviewers, if you're going to use a term in your review at least have a clue as to what you're referencing... They seem to be implying the film is (the infinitely better) Argento classic. Susperia. No -- it's not a homage to any of these films. A case can be made it condescendingly sneers at them, referring to them as ""trash"" in one scene iirc.  Even if this is an overstatement, BSS is in no way a homage to these films.

I further found the depiction of Italian stereotypes mildly ""eye roll-y"" insulting but mostly just lazy writing.  The Italian male crew is depicted as overly emotional hot-headed misogynistic womanizers who love to eat and drink wine, and likewise the females conform to similar gender specific ethnic stereotyping. At least there wasn't anyone stirring pots of ""gravy"" or mafioso members. No one angrily blurts out, ""Capisco!?!"" at least, not that I wasn't waiting for it. There's even the egotistical director pontificating about his ""vision"".

If you're tricked into renting this based on misinformed reviews because you enjoy Italian exploitation films from this era, straight-up, don't bother.  If you're up for an art-house ""descent into madness"" flick, ditto.  There are much better ones out there.  I would have much preferred if they actually made ""The Equestrian Vortex"" as a true homage to the fun and wacky Italian horror films of the 60's and 70's.  It seems like that would have been a much more entertaining and interesting film than this (though ""critics"" would undoubtedly not think so...)",1472515200,,3018,4.996
