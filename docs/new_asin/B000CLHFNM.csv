8099194,3,B000CLHFNM,"I used to watch Fat Albert on TV as a kid, and enjoyed it a lot.
Each episode always was entertaining and had a good, positive, moral message to it.

Seeing it now as an adult.....Ack! Thbbbt!
I can't even bear to watch this with my kids!

The quality of the animation is really sub-par & low budget.
Really sloppy Re-use of sequences, use of canned character animation sequences, & a complete total lack of lip-sync.

Of course the kids won't notice the lack of animation quality....
I sincerely hope that they *do* notice the Quality of the Moral Message that Mr. Cosby strove to convey.",1235952000,,589,4.537735849056604
