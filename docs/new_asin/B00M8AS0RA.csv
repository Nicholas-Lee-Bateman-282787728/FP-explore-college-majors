6564451,2,B00M8AS0RA,"The dub is absolutely atrocious. There's no feeling behind the dub at all. I'd prefer the Cardcaptors dub than this. The very first lines Sakura's VO says are horrible. You can tell she's just reading from a script. I bought this thinking I'd give this english dub a chance, but nope. Now I'm $190 poorer and unhappy with what I ended up with. I'll admit I grew up on Cardcaptors instead of Cardcaptor Sakura but even I know a bad dub when I hear it. This makes the original cardcaptors dub sound very good by comparison. Tomoyo's and Sakura's voice are the most blaringly bad out of all the voices so far in the first 3 or so episodes that I've watched so far. It just sounds like they got the cheapest voice actors. Also if you listen closely, you can hear the same voice actor(tress) doing most if not all of the background voices in the first 3 episodes. I haven't seen the rest so I don't know if it continues on with them. From what I've read online, this dub was intended for southeast asian markets, so maybe that should have been an indication. Sometimes you hear the characters say -Chan which sounds awkward when they're speaking in english. Oh, one more thing. Yukito's (Yue's) VO sounds really dumb. Sometimes you hear (her) making weird sounds like ""ughhh"" for no reason that makes Yukito sound like he's mental challenged.",1418601600,7,1337,4.551867219917012
6564452,4,B00M8AS0RA,"2014 is shaping up to be a good year for hi-def releases of 90s anime classics. With both Sailor Moon and Cowboy Bebop arriving for the first time on blu ray this Fall (not to mention escaping an unlicensed limbo period that proved to be especially long in Sailor Moon's case), we may be seeing a nostalgia-fueled resurgence at hand. But of all the classic anime of that era, Cardcaptor Sakura may be the most unlikely to receive the blu ray treatment here in the US. While Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, Gundam Wing, and Pokemon became huge hits that defined the late 90s/early 00s TV anime boom on this side of the Atlantic, Cardcaptor Sakura fell victim to a notoriously awful localization and dub that stripped it of most of its charms in an attempt to increase the show's appeal with pre-adolescent boys. Most famously the original localization skipped to the eighth episode to focus more on Sakura's male rival and was given the gender-neutral moniker ""Cardcaptors"". Still despite the horrible dub, the show was also released in uncut subtitled form on DVD and became a niche hit.

The rocky history of this show in America makes it all the sweeter then that it has beat the odds in receiving a high-def re-release more than 10 years later. For the unintiated, Cardcaptor Sakura centers on fourth-grader Sakura Kinamoto who accidentally releases a deck of magical cards called clow cards and, along with Kero, the guardian of the clow cards who takes the form of a plush bear, and her best friend Tomoyo, must capture the cards and stop them from wreaking havoc throughout Tokyo. In many ways, it's your standard entry in the magical girl anime genre. It stars a young female protagonist with magical powers who is as preoccupied with her relationships as she is her quest. However, what sets this show apart is the likability of it's characters (Kero especially is a scene-stealer throughout the 70 episodes) and the slice of life nature of it's storytelling. Sakura feels like a real-life fourth-grader and the show has no traditional villains which allows it to avoid the trap of becoming another magical girl show centered on the battle between good and evil. This is a show that's as interested in the backstory of Sakura's non-magical deceased mother as it is the mythology of the clow cards, and manages to make both equally as compelling.

NIS America has given Cardcaptor Sakura a respectful blu ray release. The show is presented in its original 4:3 aspect ratio (no scary pan and scan widescreen like the Dragon Ball Z blu rays) and the visuals have never looked better. The release also comes with a more faithful dub, but honestly, it still pales in comparison to the original Japanese track which is thankfully also here. What keeps it from five stars is the adequate packaging and extras (the box gets the job done but getting the discs out can be a pain and not much in the way of bonus material outside of a very nice book with episode synopses) and sometimes odd choices in the subtitle translations. Still this show has never looked and sounded better and with all 70 episodes in one box, this set is highly recommended.",1410048000,,3142,4.742230347349177
6564453,3,B00M8AS0RA,"Well, this isn't the original english dub from the early 2000s...and does not include the movie. Not for nostalgics...",1409961600,4,118,5.2631578947368425
6564454,4,B00M8AS0RA,"If you look past it's price this is an excellent collection, a virtual must-have.
The audio and visuals are perfectly presented in true high quality blu-ray format. The art book is gorgeous and the collectors box is sturdy and elegant. No issues here.

My PERSONAL nitpicking comes down to the bad disc storage case, which is super annoying to use and somewhat poor quality. The discs are double-stacked mostly, which is the main issue.
Next comes the subtitles which are somewhat odd feeling at times, with interesting choices of wording e.g. no use of honourifics, presented in white (I much prefer coloured subtitles).
No reversible slip-cover, which at this price was a let down.

Having said that, I still absolutely love this release and would highly recommend it.",1408838400,,770,5.0078125
6564455,4,B00M8AS0RA,"As the first person to not give this set 5 stars I may end up focusing on where the set falls short, but make no mistake CCS is a wonderful show and in my opinion is every bit equal to if not superior to Sailor Moon.  It's just a shame nobody thought this long overdue release merited the same level of attention.

The biggest draw for people I know is going to be the inclusion of a ""new"" dub.  Not the legendary Cardcaptors hack job, but a different, never before heard dub.

Stop getting excited now.

It's true, there's a new audio track, faithful to the original story, but this new dub is actually an old, forgotten dub.  And frankly the quality is just lacking.  I can't go into specifics because I haven't heard very much of it.  I don't need to.  Older fans won't want to touch it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its place: really young children might enjoy it for instance.

Dub aside, the set has bland menus and limited special features.

I'd like to go into more detail, but here's the thing: there isn't that much to talk about.  The dub was clearly intended to be the major selling point for this set, and it falls flat.  So here's what's good about the set:

Wonderful show
Excellent video quality
Still the option to watch it in Japanese (although the subtitles make some odd choices)
Very nice packaging
Fun little episode guide (written in Tomoyo's voice) to help you find your favorite episodes",1408752000,32,1421,4.457364341085271
6564456,5,B00M8AS0RA,"The series itself is excellent. I got this a few days after the release date and have already watched all the episodes. The series is basically about a girl who accidentally releases magical cards into the world and now has to get them back. It is also very chick flicky for being a show about ten year olds (at the beginning). This set of course comes with a book as pictured here. The dvds are all in one box, which can be a bit annoying but it does take up less space. The book isn't fantastic but it is good. It is basically just episode synopsis of each episodes with a couple of pictures near the end of the book. Also all 70 episodes can be watched in English for the first time ever however the set doesn't include the two movies though.",1408406400,3,745,4.216783216783217
6564457,5,B00M8AS0RA,"Wow, is all I can say about this set. I've been waiting for an official U.S. blu ray release and this set didn't disappoint. Considering you get all 70 episodes, this set is actually pretty cheap, if bought elsewhere where the seller isn't jacking up the price big time. However, this is a pretty barebones set as all you're getting is the show, art book and box. Extras included are clean openings / closings and English voiceovers. The book is just an episode by episode synopsis of all 70 episodes with pictures from each episode on each page. The only disappointing thing about this set is the English audio is in mono and not stereo. With that said, I've always liked the Japanese voices better for Cardcaptor Sakura so I'll be fine. If you're a Cardcaptor Sakura fan, do yourself a favor and just buy this set, it's worth it just to watch it in super clear HD.",1407369600,8,866,4.487341772151899
6564458,5,B00M8AS0RA,"I love this set. It is finally nice to see it available to English speaking countries.
Includes all 1-70 episodes! Shop around! It can be found for less elsewhere online.
The artbook is nice but I would have preferred more artwork from the comic creators than this.

Very nice set! Pricey but worth it for what you get!",1407110400,,319,4.5
8670665,5,B00M8AS0RA,"My favorite anime of all time! This is a wonderfully cute story! The dub, however, isn't good at all. Also, this edition is overpriced on Amazon. It's cheaper on Right Stuf Anime.",1501632000,,179,4.625
8670666,4,B00M8AS0RA,"The episode guide is hardcover and quite lovely, the color fade across all of the discs is a nice touch. The remaster looks absolutely gorgeous, and the subtitle translation for the most part preserves all of the original intents and relationships (as opposed to the ""Cardcaptors"" edition).

Some may question the change of Syaoran to Xiaolang, but I'm not terribly bothered by it, except that it's sort of clunky to translate ""Li-kun"" to ""Xiaolang"", because you lose the formality. The choice that the translators had was either to preserve the original Japanese by bringing it over directly as ""Li-Kun"" or ""Syaoran-chan"" as appropriate, or to try to localize it for western audiences.

Keep in mind that this is primarily a children's show, and the nuances of Japanese honorifics and formalities will likely be lost on that demographic.",1483660800,2,838,5.109489051094891
8670667,3,B00M8AS0RA,"So before you read this review, keep in mind this is my opinion and so I can help others who are about to deal with the same thing. First the box set is pretty awesome because you get all 70 episodes and a cute art book, that's probably the only great thing about it.

However the voice acting and music is totally different. The person working on the English dub got so much flack for the voices  being more mature that only 23 episodes and the first movie made it. I want to defend them. And as a result, they have 70 episodes in the new voice English language you can't recognize. I grew up watching this on tv and decided to buy it. What I didn't know is they had an original version. I personally hate the English voices so much on this Blu Ray DVDs that I am forced to watch in in Japanese. I am very shocked at the change. The western version I saw on tv sound a lot better, they made me laugh when I was a kid. Now I cannot tell the voices apart. All the voices for Sakura, Kero, Madison, they sound alike! They sound very high pitched and squeaky. On dark scenes, there seems to be the most happiest music playing in the background, so obvious, it irritating. They take a dark and interesting cartoon and turn it pink with multicolor totally destroying my interest in this anime. The music and voices for the English version made me rush home to watch it. But now I seriously do not recognize it any more. The opening songs are boring, and this includes the background music. Not to mention a change in name pronunciation, what?

For those who saw the original, I am sure it was an opposite effect. But for me, I am going to have to get use to the different name changes and character responses. I am not saying don't buy it, but be prepared.",1468195200,2,1751,4.236526946107785
8670668,5,B00M8AS0RA,I watched the western dub as a child and fell in love with it... So happy to see the show all over :),1456963200,,101,3.4347826086956523
8670669,4,B00M8AS0RA,"This is a bittersweet boon for many fans of this legendary series. On the one hand, we finally have an official release of the full, uncut Cardcaptor Sakura that's NOT a mediocre bootleg. On the other hand, any fans who have seen the mangled English dub will find this cast extremely lacking. The representation, cells, colors and audio are all perfect and luckily these DVD sets DO contain the original Japanese sound track. That said, the voice acting for the English dub is subpar to say the least. Very amateurish (inflections and emphases added at strange times that barely matches the characters' reactions), no big name seiyuus to carry the production, and there are several major pronunciations that differ from the previous English dub (MadHouse's ""Card Captors"") that will be off-putting to any fans who first learned of/sampled the series through that production. ""Clow"" is pronounced ""Cloh"", as opposed to the """" (ah) sound used in it. Sakura is pronounced ""Suh-KOOra"" as opposed to the proper ""SAH-kra"" and Kerberos is pronounced ""Ker-BEAR-os."", which is actually much closer to the actual name (A Japanese play on words of the Greek ""Cerberus"") than ""Keroberos"" was in the other dub. As for the voices, while most of them do match the characters well enough, they just leave something to be desired. Kero, in particular, is high and whiny especially compared to the deep, self-assured voice he had in the previous dub. Sakura just sounds like your average young girl and her brother and love interest are just as generic.

Here's the thing though: while the voice acting was much better in MadHouse's ""Cardcaptors"", the footage was cut, mangled and re-arranged to make the whole series more American/child friendly. This is a very polarizing issue for fans--you either love it or you despise it for what it did to CardCaptor Sakura. For those of the former, this production is a hard pill to swallow. For the latter and those who've never seen Cardcaptors, it's a fairly decent addition to your ""Magical Girl"" collection that does the original justice--other than certain aspects of the voice acting for the English Dub.",1453593600,9,2134,5.011267605633803
8670670,5,B00M8AS0RA,It's awesome! It came on time and was in great shape and quality! Came with an excellent episode guide with the discs! Worth the buy! Only issues was the blueray disc holder broke sometime during transportation.,1439856000,,211,4.888888888888889

8670673,2,B00M8AS0RA,"I will only review the english subtitles since I don't bother with dub.
I have been a huge CCS fan since the 90s' and watched the original series on fansubbed VHS. So when I heard that NIS obtained the blu-ray collection, there was no way I could pass on it even with the hefty price tag. For the $200 price mark, I still did not expect perfection but of all the things that could've gone wrong, why did they make this one little subtitle mistake?

The video quality looks great. The boxing and extras look great etc etc...but the subtitles is where it falls short.
From here on, mostly fans who have watched the Japanese series will probably understand.

All the character names were subtitled correctly with the exception of Touya (Toya in the blu-ray) and...Syaoran (Xiaolang).
I don't mind too much that they changed his name from Syaoran to Xiaolang, but why in the world did they change the subtitle to not reflect what the actual Japanese audio says?
SPOILER:
In Cardcaptor Sakura, for a majority of the series, Sakura would call Syaoran ""Li-kun"" and Syaoran would call Sakura...well, nothing. However, on the Blu-ray subtitles, whenever Sakura said ""Li-kun"", the subtitles showed ""Xiaolang""...Oh my god, she specifically says ""Li-kun"". Why did NIS take it upon themselves and changed it to ""Xiaolang""?
People who never watched the series would probably say ""who cares?"", but for the people who did watch the series, you guys know how significant the whole ""Li-kun"" to ""Syaoran-kun"" phase was to the series and to the fans. It was one of the most important S+S scenes in the whole series.
So this change gets awkward come time for the actual scene in episode 57 ""Sakura, Syaoran and the Elevator"". At the scene where Sakura calls Syaoran to ask if she can call him ""Syaoran-kun"" from then on, the subtitles changed her whole dialogue to say something along the lines of ""Can we get to know each other better?""....That's not what she said...that's not even remotely close to what she said.

To many, this is probably not a dealbreaker and many might not mind, but it ruined it for me.
Just one little change in wording, and this Blu-ray box set would've been perfect.

Thank you for reading this rant from a S+S fan.",1424304000,52,2222,4.7338501291989665
8670674,5,B00M8AS0RA,"This is a really great set. I've been waiting for it for a very, very long time now. If you're looking for the ""american nostalgia"" factor this probably isn't what your looking for. This is Cardcaptor Sakura the japanese sub and their version of the dub. What aired in America was Cardcaptors. Which is an extremely edited dub to try and appeal to the american audience by using american slang terms, food names and really tried to hide all relationships between everyone. I much prefer Cardcaptor Sakura it feels like it should, like the manga.",1423872000,,545,4.747368421052632
