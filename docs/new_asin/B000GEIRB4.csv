2605978,4,B000GEIRB4,"Following their other dvds, this also is five different 10 minute workouts.  You can't say that you don't have even 10 minutes to spare.  It's funny; you just go and do one workout, and before you know it, you have probably made it through a second or third.  That's one of the things I really like about the 10 Minute Solution series.

In the different workouts there is lower body and upper body, cardio, core and one for increasing flexibility.  The routines are all creative and interesting.  You aren't just doing the usual crunches but different exercises to keep this fresh.  The instructor Kimberly, is motivating and she makes it fun.  I like the cardio section the best.  She makes it easy to follow because she is another good cuer.  You always know what's next so it's easy to keep up with.  I really like this and while it's not the most challenging, it's enjoyable and mixes up my routine to keep me from getting bored.",1154131200,52,933,4.5602409638554215

2605980,5,B000GEIRB4,"I absolutely love this fitness ball workout with Kimberly Spreen.  Yes, it was produced in 2006 and this is 2015 - really, when it comes to an excellent, fun and challenging workout, the date does not matter.  Or, maybe it works to your benefit, because I just got mine used on amazon for a terrific, low price. Thanks to Kimberly's delightful workout, I have re-discovered my stability ball.  I hadn't used it in a long time, I think because some of the ball workouts I now own are kind of slow moving and boring.  NOT this one - it's wonderful - very spirited and lively.  Plus you get a really good workout!  I had intended to only do 2 or 3 of the 10 minute segments, but I was enjoying myself so much that I just worked out to the entire dvd.  Now that is a good instructor and a good routine!",1443052800,,798,4.2105263157894735
2605981,5,B000GEIRB4,"I have enjoyed using this 1 video for sometime. Its my fall back on exercise video.  I like how it has 6 different 10 minute videos all located on this one disk, which allows you to pick and arrange the exercises into any order you want each time you exercise.  The 6 different exercises offered on this 1 disk all target different parts of the body too.  The intensity of this video was on the medium to low end of the spectrum for me, not to hard, but a little easier then I would have liked.  The instructor of this video is happy, very easy to follow and she shows you how to do each exercise she wants you to preform.",1442620800,,622,4.115702479338843

2605997,1,B000GEIRB4,I put this DVD in and it was not 10 Minute Solution: Fitness Ball Workouts. It's some Boot Camp workout DVD. I double checked the cover and compared it to the DVD and they both show the same picture and say 10 Minute Solution but the DVD is totally different. It doesn't even have the same fitness instructor. I am totally disappointed in this purchase.,1424995200,,353,4.446153846153846
2605998,3,B000GEIRB4,Average routine. In my opinion if you excersise regurarly then it can be used as a supplementary routine to another one. I use it when I'm low on energy.,1419811200,,153,4.310344827586207

2606003,5,B000GEIRB4,"Awesome workout. I thought I was in shape but this one kicked butt. Yes, she talks quickly but the explanations are straightforward and easy to follow. She doesn't fill in gaps with meaningless talk which is what I want. With other 10 min workouts a lot of time is spent introducing the form and time passes quickly but not with this one. Each session felt like an eternity. I love this workout, she makes it look deceptively easy but effectively tones all areas.  I only wish she had a few more videos to add to my collection.",1415750400,,527,4.43298969072165

2606024,5,B000GEIRB4,"I recently purchased an exercise ball and needed some ideas for what all could be done with it. Great video. 5 different work-outs that you can do together or separately. Ten minutes flies right by, mostly because the work-outs are not repetitive due to their short time. The first time I did the DVD it was difficult, but once you get used to the ball the exercises are mostly very easy. The instructor is pleasant, and though it's annoying that she can talk through each workout without so much as a deep inhale while I'm panting and sweating, her instructions are clear and easy to follow.",1391817600,,592,4.59433962264151
2606025,3,B000GEIRB4,"its a series of 5 workouts, each 10 min, no fuss no scary trainer, just a nice good and quick workout for people just starting out. it's from 2006 so its a little old but theres no issues in my book.",1390435200,,199,3.8780487804878048
2606026,5,B000GEIRB4,I love this DVD and go back to it often. The cardio section is my least favorite but the core and upper is great.,1390176000,,113,3.75
2606027,3,B000GEIRB4,I'm sure this workout is just fine for people that train with the fitness ball frequently. But for me it was in the way and I never felt like I was doing any of the moves right so I couldn't get a good workout in. I'm sure with more practice I could overcome it but when I workout I just want to get to it and burn some calories not roll around on a giant ball trying to keep my balance.,1389225600,,387,3.7901234567901234
2606028,4,B000GEIRB4,I like the whole 10 minute series and this one is just as good. some parts are hard to follow and some parts move too quickly but overall I'm pleased with it.,1389139200,,158,3.96875
2606029,5,B000GEIRB4,By having 10 minute segments it keeps your attention longer and it is an easy exercise routine to follow.  Young and older people can do this.,1385164800,,142,4.461538461538462

2606031,4,B000GEIRB4,I love it! I use it in addition to my exercise program. The Ultra Stretch is great! The only hard thing is trying to watch while  doing the exercises until you learn the moves (as with any new dvd).,1381190400,,198,4.076923076923077

2606036,5,B000GEIRB4,"I love this DVD! The workouts are fun, effective & challenging. Yet they're not so difficult that I have a hard time following.
So long as you stick with it, you will see results. The hosts name is Kimberlee & she has a really great energy. I can picture myself working along side of her in a gym. I like her a lot & she makes me want to turn on the tape again.
I don't know about you, but it doesn't matter how fun or effective the workout is, if the host is annoying then I can't make myself do it. Not the case with Kimberlee. :)",1376784000,,532,3.935185185185185

2606038,4,B000GEIRB4,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness but am coming off a bad ankle injury and extended fitness break of a few months.

Some of the moves were tougher than others so I did sweat some but not as much as with some of the ballet workouts I use such as Ballet Beautiful.  I thought the ball was better utilized in Total Body Pilates with Mini Ball but this workout was tougher so I would be more inclined to repeat this one.

Instructor talked a little fast but overall non-annoying.  Production quality, camera angles, music and sound are good as with all 10 minute solution videos.",1371772800,,604,4.564814814814815
2606039,3,B000GEIRB4,"I have used a work out ball in the past, and really enjoyed it. I bought this DVD so I could really get a great work out on the ball. The thing is, I'm hopelessly uncoordinated, and try as I might I CANNOT get my body to follow along with what Kimberly is instructing. With the exception of the upper body work out, it seems like she could have used at least 15 minutes instead of trying to cram everything into ten. She moves so quickly, I just felt lost, or like I was most likely doing everything improperly.

I love the upper body work out on the ball. It has been nice being able to change up my work with weights for my arms and chest. I wish the rest of the DVD would have been as concise as this section. Instead, it is rushed and sort or frenzied. I'll have to find something different for me.",1370908800,,802,4.075949367088608
2606040,5,B000GEIRB4,Great work out and easy to work into any schedule. You feel the burn the first time you use it. This seems as if it may get boring fast but I still enjoy it.,1370736000,,157,3.6470588235294117
2606041,5,B000GEIRB4,Kimberly is great to workout with. Not too fast and not too slow. She doesn't talk to you like your stupid like some other workout DVDs.  You can customize your own workout and when you get tired of that one customize another one.  This DVD is great.,1369958400,,250,4.297872340425532
2606042,4,B000GEIRB4,The core was not that difficult but the lower body workout did hurt.  It should have been a little longer than 10 minutes maybe 15 and I would have given it 5 stars.,1369094400,,165,4.0
2606043,3,B000GEIRB4,I know they only have 10 min but for some reason it is more rushed than they need to.  I have no complians but not the most exiting video either.,1368748800,,145,3.8333333333333335
2606044,4,B000GEIRB4,"This workout instructor moves and talks quickly!  However, after a few times I got the hang of it, and I'm glad that it moves along without a lot of downtime.  This workout is challenging without leaving me in a lot of pain the next day.  It leaves me just a little sore.  The focus is definitely on the midsection and lower body.  If you want a challenging workout for your arms, that isn't really the focus of this video.  The ball adds some interest -- A lot of the moves are standard pilates moves, but with a twist.  Overall, it's an interesting workout which isn't too much of a killer but definitely not too easy either.  If you're looking to mix up your pilates routine, I recommend this one.",1368316800,2,700,4.372093023255814
2606045,5,B000GEIRB4,"I like these workouts because they are simple and easy to follow.  You get a good workout the first time you watch it!  There are several 10 minute workouts and you can customize your routine each time.  You can select to do just one routine, or select several and it will play them all in a row for you.  A lot of the exercises are basic skills, but she gives you options to increase the intensity if you want.  Great DVD!",1366675200,,423,4.172839506172839

2606047,5,B000GEIRB4,"this is great as it's a series of 10 minute solutions for all your core body areas - so  you can focus on one if you only have a few minutes, or you can mix and match and get a pretty good hour-long cardio workout. It's also nice to be able to do at home if you can't get to the gym- all you need is the medium size ball and some light hand weights.",1366243200,,349,3.6533333333333333

It does recommend hand weights for the upper body workout which can be purchased online or at your local big box store for a few bucks.  She has a cheerful demeanor, conversational, and encouraging to keep going.  I didn't find any particular move too difficult and she added directions where she could indicating how to intensify or make a move tougher as we build strenth and ability.

2606063,4,B000GEIRB4,"This is a good workout that will make you sweat.  I actually really liked the arm workout even though it's a stretch to say it's a fitness ball workout (you sit on the ball while doing a circuit of traditional weight exercises).  The abs workout was mainly just crunches (though I really felt these working), and I didn't ""feel the burn"" on some of the moves.  Legs were pretty challenging (though my lower back started hurting during this session even while I was keeping it straight) and so was the cardio.  Stretch was OK - definitely not on par of pilates or yoga.  I feel like I got a good workout after using this but it isn't particularly fun to do - you just feel like you're working out like in gym class or something.

It's a very good challenge for me without being over the top and unattainable. The upper body, lower body, core and cardio workouts are very helpful and useful - but the last (muscle stretching one or whatever) isn't - for me.  After using this almost every day for 2 weeks I can feel the difference in my stamina and ease in stair climbing.  Sadly, the exercising has caused me to eat more so I haven't lost anything yet - but I'm working on that.
The fitness ball and these exercises don't take up much space in your house, it's a relatively inexpensive way to go, and it's even kinda fun.
I'd recommend this.

I will add that you need a large room with a high ceiling.  Some of the work-outs have movements that involve lifting the ball over your head.  If you have a low ceiling, or a ceiling fan like I have, watch out!  Kimberly Spreen is easy to follow and pleasant to watch.  She is encouraging and inspiring without being annoying, overly perky or barky like certain others.  My advice is to find a big room and have fun with this DVD!",1340323200,,565,4.264150943396227

3. Targets and tones areas fast.

I've been doing this for 2 1/2 weeks and a co-worker came up to me
to tell me ""how cut my arms are""...and I haven't worked out for 2 years, and didn't tell them I was working out at home.. Now that's PROOF!

I particularly enjoy the innovation of the moves; there were several ab and lower body toners that I've never even heard of before--a real rarity in fitness DVDs! I would ABSOLUTELY recommend these 5 workouts to anyone who wants to either explore or expand their knowledge of pilates, and definitely to anyone looking to get the most bang for their buck if they're limited on time (these workouts move quickly, but that's great for someone not looking to waste a moment)! Even after only 10 minutes you've got a great workout here, and it only keeps getting better as you try each new segment. An ""A"" for sure!",1325203200,3,818,4.423841059602649

I use this as a 10-minute add-on to the end of a workout.  For example, I'll do a 35-minute lower body DVD first, then put in the 10-minute abs workout.

But please, be VERY careful during the upper body segment.  Kimberly does a set of ""rear flies."" She leans over and raises her arms to shoulder level, almost behind her back.  I'm not sure what the proper form is for this exercise. But when I tried to do what she did, I hyperextended and gave myself tendonitis!  Make sure your arms point forward 30 and don't go up as far.

It's broken down into 5 segments: arms, core, legs, flexibility and cardio. I found only the legs section difficult to do. After 10 minutes of doing it, my legs are totally sore. I can't do the legs section every consecutive day so I have to take a day or twos break before I do the legs section again. Other than that, all the other sessions are relatively not too difficult. I really love this workout because I usually combine and do the arms, core and legs in a day and after that I'm sweating so much and feel like I've really worked out. I only do the cardio and flexibility workouts once in a while because they are a little challenging for me. Overall, this is a very good buy.",1322524800,,823,4.248407643312102

2606085,5,B000GEIRB4,"While I'm a very avid exerciser who has done nearly every type of workout there is, I'd never really tried a DVD focused fully on pilates.  This may not have been the best intro-to-pilates DVD to pick, but I am so glad that I got this workout over any other pilates DVD on the market!

The moves included are extremely challenging and sometimes make me more sore than some of my boot camp workouts.  The instructor also moves very quickly through the moves but always manages to still explain them well enough that a novice like me could follow the movements without too much difficulty (I'll admit that the first time I did this DVD I was lagging a bit behind, though).  Like most of the other reviewers have said, the instructor-Andrea Leigh Rogers was very brisk and and moved very quickly, somewhat different from her other 10 Minute Solution DVD.  However, I still found her to be friendly and helpful, making the workout be much more enjoyable than it would have been with a boring instructor.

There are 5 10-minute workouts on the DVD with the first 4 containing floorwork and the last one being standing work.  The floorwork sections require a small inflatable ball that comes with the DVD and is easy to blow up and use.  I thought that the ball added an additional level to some moves that I'm not sure would have challenged me despite my newness to pilates.  The majority of the moves are focused on abs and lower body-specifically, the glutes and thighs.  However, the workout still sculpts other muscle groups such as the quads and shoulders just to a much lesser degree.

Because I've never really done a pilates DVD before, I'm not entirely sure of the names of the moves included; but I do know that there was definite variety in all of the sections, and I have never gotten the least bit bored when I've done these workouts.  Like I said earlier, the moves are very tough!  When I first began, there were moves that I could not finish, because my muscles were too fatigues.  I have become much more able to do the workouts after just a few times through this DVD, though.  There are still some areas I haven't reached in flexibility, but I am still able to do the exercises just with slight modifications.

Overall, I can't recommend this pilates DVD enough!  Intermediate and Advanced exercisers of pilates will definitely find a challenge in this workout, and Beginners will find a huge challenge.  However, I think this is still doable for all levels, and it will absolutely leave you sore in the morning!",1312934400,5,2526,4.625560538116592
2606086,5,B000GEIRB4,"I exercise regularly and own many DVDs. My acquaintance with pilates is not new either. I can say-without hesitation- that the workouts in this DVD are so unique, efficient and fun I look forward to do them. For the first time in all those years I have been exercising with VHS/DVDs (well above 10), I am considering to purchase the SAME DVD and own a second one just in case something happens to the one I use all the time. The moves are smart. So smart to the point they fascinate me every time I do. I will be purchasing other DVDs by the same instructor.

2606088,4,B000GEIRB4,"This DVD is part of the 10 Minute Solution series, DVDs which offer five 10-Minute workouts.  Quick Sculpt Pilates is led by Andrea Leigh Rogers, who more recently has founded the Xtend Barre workout franchise (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xtend-Barre-Lean-Chiseled/dp/B004BBDHFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xtend Barre: Lean & Chiseled</a>).  Rogers has a background in professional dance and is certified in classical Pilates instruction.  Here she uses a small Pilates ball in all but the very last workout segment; the ball adds a bit of a refreshing spin to the traditional Pilates moves.  The only other prop required for this workout is a mat.

Like all of the DVDs in the 10 Minute Solution series, Quick Sculpt Pilates is Customizable.  The Main Menu offers options to Play All, Select One Workout, or Program Your Workout (select 1-5 segments for a customized workout experience).  I have listed the segments below in the order which the appear on the menu as well as have provided brief descriptions of each.

TOTAL BODY TONER
This section starts with several exercises adapted from the Pilates reformer.  For these moves, Rogers is lying on her back with the ball between her ankles for several versions of in/out moves.  This is followed by variations on the Hundred (keeping the ball between the ankles and squeezing in), the Roll-Up (ball between the hands), and the Rollover (returning the ball between the ankles).  Next comes Coordination, Single Leg Circles with one foot pressing into the ball, and Open Leg Rocker with the ball between the thighs.  The most challenging exercise of the segment follows:  ""Teaser Toss,"" in which you roll up into teaser, shift the ball from your hands to your feet and back again.  Rogers concludes with a version of Saw, holding the ball in one hand.

BUN AND THIGH SCULPTOR
For this segment, Rogers completes all of the work on one side before moving on to the other side.  The fairly challenging side kick series starts with the ball under the torso and includes kicks front/back, kicks up/down, leg circles, passe, hot potato, and ronde de jambe.  Rogers also transitions the ball to between the thighs for both single and double leg lifts.  She concludes this segment lying on the back for some brief bridging work for the hamstrings/glutes performed with the feet on the ball.

STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY TRAINING
Because this segment focuses largely on strengthening the back, the majority of the exercises are performed while lying on the stomach.  Rogers begins with the ball under the hands, rolling in and out for Swan Prep.  Next, she moves the ball to behind the knee for Single Leg Kicks and then between the ankles for Double Leg Kicks and Leg Lifts.  She continues with alternating arm and leg lifts, moving into Swimming (somewhat difficult with the ball still between the ankles!).  At this point, Rogers shifts to lying on the back for moves adapted from the Spinal Corrector apparatus.  Here, the ball is placed under the tailbone and the legs engage in Froggy, Scissors, Helicopter, and Heel Beats.  She concludes with Spine Stretch Forward (ball under the hands).

CORE CONDITIONING
In this segment, Rogers beings with the Pilates ""Series of Five,"" although each segment is of course modified to incorporate the ball.  For the Single Leg Stretch, she passes the ball under the knees.  For Double Leg Stretch, she holds the ball between the ankles.  For the Double Straight Leg Stretch, Rogers again passes the ball behind her now-straight legs.  When performing the Leg Lowers, Rogers again holds the ball between her ankles, adding in a triple pulse on the way down.  Finally, for Criss-Cross, she balances the ball between the opposite elbow/knee, then switches.  Following the Series of Five, Rogers places the ball between her thighs for a series of hip tucks; this is followed by single-leg Teasers, rolling the ball up the leg.  She concludes with a seated twist/reach and a version of Rowing.

STANDING PILATES SCULPT
This segment surprised me.  As noted above, it is the only section that does not use the ball, and I was expecting traditional Pilates standing exercises like the Pilates arms series.  Instead, Rogers adapts MAT exercises to a standing format, which makes for an interesting change of pace, including some balance challenges.  She starts with a one-legged version of the Hundred and then does standing Single Leg Circles to the front, side, and back.  Other interesting variations include a standing Roll-Down and standing Rolling Like a Ball (again, more of a balance challenge).  The only time that Rogers goes down to the mat here is a combination roll-down/swan prep move.

Overall, I did like how the ball added a unique challenge to the Pilates moves featured in this workout.  Since I have never had the opportunity to use the Reformer or other Pilates machines, I enjoyed experimenting with some of the moves that stimulated these.  In addition, I felt a nice burn during the Bun and Thigh Sculptor, and although I am an intermediate exercise, I was generally challenged by the other workouts.

I do want to add a caution about Rogers' instruction.  She talks QUITE fast--during the first workout in particular, I felt like I was listening to her on fast forward!  She allows absolutely NO time for setup or instruction; rather, she just moves briskly from move-to-move, side-to-side, barely giving the viewer time to take a breath.  For this reason, prior experience with Pilates is a MUST for those interested in this DVD.  If Rogers had been a bit less frenetic in her instruction, I might have given this DVD 5-stars, but still, these workouts are quite worthwhile, and I do recommend them.

P.S.--If you happen to get a copy of this DVD without the ball, you can use a ball like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-Body-Back-Ball-Pump/dp/B00374O8JK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9"" Body Back Ball & Pump</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soft-Gym-Overball-Assorted-Colors-LE9505/dp/B002C9GORA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soft Gym Overball (Assorted Colors) # LE9505</a>.",1308009600,9,6220,5.324795081967213
2606089,4,B000GEIRB4,I was looking for a short exercise and found this amazing balance ball workout. If you can't afford your own personal trainer then this dvd will help you. Awesome! Easy to follow. I have two kids and a single parent i  don't have much time but 10 min. Workout really helps. I recommended it to all nt friends who have a busy lifestyle.,1307232000,,335,4.317460317460317
2606090,5,B000GEIRB4,I teach gym at an all girls alternative high school and we LOVE this workout.  The abs section is AWESOME.  This is the most requested exercise ball dvd by my students.,1303689600,,168,4.387096774193548
2606091,4,B000GEIRB4,"I rather enjoy this 10 minute Solutions workout dvd and think it is one of the better workout ball dvds out there. I typically do all 5 segments in one workout but what's nice about this dvd is you could customize your workout to include any number of them. This is most geared to beginners and low intermediates, however, I think is appropriate for all levels. This is not one of those workout dvds that's too easy to be worthwhile for the more advanced exerciser. I consider myself intermediate and found it somewhat challenging. The 5 segments are as follows:

1) Lower Body-- There are a lot of squats and lunges in this section and quite a few repetitions. You bounce and raise the ball overhead as well which gets you really working. There's also some glute and hamstring work. This is one of the more challenging segments and good for working most of the lower body muscles.

2) Upper Body-- I actually really enjoyed this section but I had to increase the weight amount from what she uses. There's a weights circuit that is repeated 3 times and each time there are slight variations on some of the exercises to keep your interest and work a little bit differently. She gets at all of the major muscles in the arms, shoulders, upper back and chest. By the third rep my muscles were fatigued.

3) Core-- There are several crunches and oblique work while sitting on the ball and leaning over it on your side. She shows how to make the exercises easier or more difficult based on your level. There's some more ab work laying on the ground with your feet on the ball and finally some plank work. The exercises in and of themselves are not too difficult but I really enjoy the added challenge of balancing on the ball, which I always notice most with core work.

4) Cardio-- It begins kind of slowly with squats and lunges, again with bouncing and tossing the ball. It's kind of fun but didn't do much for my heart rate. She then adds in some jumping exercises which get you working more. They're not super high impact and for many of them the ball helps with the impact so it's not too hard on your knees. She gets a lot of variety into this little 10 minute segment and in the end, it did feel like a somewhat intense cardio workout.

5) Flexibility-- I was kind of disappointed in this section. There are lunges and hip flexor stretches, but they didn't feel all that different from what was done in earlier segments other than holding the positions a little longer. She also stretches your hamstrings and there are some arm/shoulder stretches while seated on the ball. I feel like you could have gotten much deeper stretches using the ball during the 10 minute time period but it's still a nice end to the workout.

This is one of my favorite stability ball workout dvds. The exercises offer a decent amount of variety and a nice, attainable challenge, and the instructor Kimberly is very pleasant and gives clear instructions. So far I like all of the 10 minute Solutions dvds I've tried.",1301961600,4,2995,4.526802218114603
2606092,5,B000GEIRB4,"After buying a fitness ball I wanted to have some good exercise routines. First I bought a book but it didn't work as you have to stop every time to read the instructions! I still use it to do the warm up and also the instruction of how to sit correctly on the ball because there are none on the DVD. I have quite a bit of space in my living room but not where I can see the TV, still it works so the amount of space needed to do the exercises is not horrendous! My living room ceiling is also not too high but, not being very tall I manage to do the exercises where you have to lift the ball. If you are taller and your ceiling is as high as mine (modern house) you won't be able to stretch your arms. But.... the routines are fun and not too difficult, still you feel that you have really worked out! I have only tried two so far but I will try all the other ones this week. I read a lot of reviews before I decided to buy this DVD and I must say that I don't regret it. I own a few other 10 Minute Solution DVD and I really like them except maybe the Salsa one because I struggle with the speed of the explanations.",1299456000,,1118,3.865217391304348

I look forward to when I can have better stability on using the ball.",1298678400,,350,4.161764705882353
2606094,5,B000GEIRB4,"This is my favorite workout DVD.  I like that you can mix and match the 5 10-minute segments to customize a workout.  Instructions are easy to follow, even for a beginner--that is a beginner with the fitness ball.  If you are completely out of shape, the exercises will be quite challenging.  If you are in tip top shape, they probably won't challenging enough.  This is great for those of us who are in between.  I think it's a fun DVD and it helps motivate me to exercise on days I don't feel like it:  I'll start with one 10-minute workout; often that gets me going and I add 1 or 2 more.",1298160000,2,591,4.223214285714286
2606095,5,B000GEIRB4,"Finally an exercise DVD that is workable and also works. Many individual movements are executed at a fast pace and make the 10 minutes fly by. You can select one or several of the 10 minute routines depending on your time and energy level. Even doing one 10 minute routine leaves you feeling invigorated and thoroughly toned. Dont be put off by the ball. It is small, blown up with a straw and held between the knees or thighs to intensify the toning.",1297555200,2,451,4.445783132530121

2606098,5,B000GEIRB4,"To summarize, I would recommend this DVD.
Pros:
- Routines are interesting enough.
- It's fun.
- It's easy to just pick one workout if you don't have a lot of time.
- The instructor is OK, and so is the music and the stage/set - I'm not disappointed, but not impressed either.
- I got a really good shoulders work out from the upper body track.
- All the routines seem to work the abs/engage the abs to some degree.
Cons:
- Not many cons. One con was that the instructor used the same weights for all the upper body exercises - for the shoulders I was really challenged w/ my 5lb weights, but for the biceps 5lbs was very easy. Yet the DVD doesn't give enough time for you to switch from one set of weights to another.
Notes:
- You need weights to do some of the exercises - in the DVD the instructor uses 2 lb weights in the DVD but says that you can work up to larger weights. I used 5 lb weights (I work out regularly and that was the correct weight for me, although I think if I keep doing this DVD I'll work up to being able to use 8 lb weights).
- One other note - the instructor does some of the moves rather fast. This could frustrate someone who does not exercise regularly (for me it was fine).
- Also, I'm 5'6"" and used a 75cm exercise ball, which was too big for me. I think a 65cm ball is the correct size for most women.",1295827200,4,1334,4.0
2606099,4,B000GEIRB4,"You will need a 12x12 space to do these workuots.  Remember you're going to be lifting and throwing and bouncing an ENORMOUS BALL during this workout!  Also, make sure your ceilings are at least 3 ft. highher than the tips of your fingers or the ball will catch during the over the head lifts!
Great variety and heart-revving workouts though!!",1295136000,,343,4.7
2606100,4,B000GEIRB4,"I love working out with my stability ball and this DVD is a good workout.  You can do 10 minutes, 20, 30, 40 or all for 50 minutes.  I suggest working up to that, though!  Easy to follow directions, she has a nice voice and a positive attitude which I appreciate.  I would recommend this DVD for an all-over good exercise program.",1293580800,2,330,4.274193548387097
2606101,4,B000GEIRB4,A great work out and a nice one for my 50 DVDs collection. Works a lot of muscle groups as you will feel it the next day.  Something different for me.  Great workout!!,1293148800,,167,4.03030303030303
2606102,3,B000GEIRB4,"This DVD has 5-10 minute workouts focusing on lower body, upper body, core, cardio and flexibility.  The lower body workout is challenging with squats, lunges, and raising the ball over your head and jumping.  The Core workout focuses on crunches and working your obliques.  The flexibility workout is just that: testing our your flexibility and stretching a lot.  That would be a good cool down.  Overall, this was an ok workout, but working out with fitness balls are normally low intensity.  I consider myself healthy and active, and I normally do moderate to high intensity workouts each week. So, in my opinion, I consider this workout to be low intensity and good to do on your ""off"" day, or if you don't have a lot of time to workout.",1293062400,2,741,4.705426356589148

2606104,5,B000GEIRB4,"This is the first time I've worked on a stability ball and I really enjoyed it. The moves are not terribly exciting or varied, but I don't mind because Kimberly has such a great, friendly personality (""You wanted to do another set, right?"" ""Now hand me the weights. Don't actually hand them to me, we're not done yet."") The lower body section has some excellent moves for the hamstrings, we often hear about stretching them but this has some of the few moves I've seen that really strengthens them. The moves in the upper body section are very controlled so you can keep increasing your weight without losing form. The stretch program, while not superior, is very good considering that this comes from Ten Minute Solution (I've been underwhelmed by many of their stretches, check out Madeleine Lewis for some good ones.) I initially used a weighted ball (it's got sand in the bottom) which is great for people who want to move the focus from the core to the arms. I have a low ceiling, which could be problematic with the lifting the ball overhead, but I think it's fine just lifting the ball to head height. I'll definitely look for more Kimberly Spreen workouts.",1291507200,,1164,4.655339805825243

Honestly, though, there have been several times when I said I would just do 2 and before I knew it I'd done all 5 workouts. It feels so good and the flexibility routine is a good way to strech out the muscles after each workout.

I recommend you are familiar with Pilates movements because this is more likely for intermediate-advanced due to the pace.  My favorite qualities about this exercise dvd is the additional tool of the small, lightweight ball which feel nice when you hug and squeeze the ball(tension); transitions between exercises: from difficult alternates to less difficult; Standing Pilates and Strength & Flexibility segments are my usual rotation.

She has applied her fitness expertise in designing each 10-minute segment for maximum effectiveness in working the large muscle groups. Kimberly is cheerful and genuine in her encouragement.

Thanks to her coaching, even balance-challenged people like myself can move smoothly on the ball from kneeling to prone, or sitting to hip-lift exercise sets. There are no gimmicky moves, such as rolling one leg on the ball (suffered elsewhere). Hand weight work is integrated thoughtfully, and core work for the back is the best I've found among fitness ball DVDs.

I just wish that Ms. Spreen would release a Fitness Ball II Workout! ;>",1255737600,,781,5.141732283464567

2606131,4,B000GEIRB4,"I am beginning to wonder if the 'Quick' in this title, has a double meaning in that the instructor not only talks very quickly, but also carries out the moves in double quick time.  Not that this is a bad thing, just a change of pace from the previous Pilates DVDs from 10 Minute Solutions.

There are 5, 10 minute workouts, mostly concentrating on lower body, abs, flexibility and balance.  The first 4 workouts are fantastic (once you get up to the instructor's speed) and the ball presents more of a challenge than I could have imagined.  The routines are both stretching and challenging,  fantastic for toning, core stability, balance, strength, posture and flexibility.  The moves are fun too -  my favourites including 'the helicopter' and the sequence of ballet moves, plus pulsing the ball is alot harder than it looks, and you will really feel your muscles burning when you're done.

The standing abs workout is the only section not to utilise the ball, and while I'm not convinced of the difference it will make to defining a better waist, the balance work is brilliant - very graceful.  There isn't a dedicated section for arms, but this routine is done with your arms held up, so you will get some work done here, and in the other segments, as part of the overall sequences.

The instructor also focuses on coordinating and posture, explaining all the moves clearly, but in a very hurried fashion.  She comes across as efficient and precise, preferring brisk instruction over a friendlier, more relaxed style, but this doesn't distract from the workout, my only criticism would be the overuse of the word 'gorgeous' as it's said so frequently, I found myself looking out for it!

Overall, a great addition to the 10 Minute Solution Pilates series.

As a footnote, in case you were wondering, the ball is quite small, and comes with a straw device that you use to inflate with your mouth, bit like a very sturdy balloon.",1251936000,26,1931,4.745508982035928

The cool thing with this set of work-outs is you use your core the entire time for balance using the ball. Also, when doing the core-specific 10-minute segment, you get an EXTRA intense work-out because of the ball. This is my first stability ball dvd and my first time using the ball so I can't really compare it to others. But I really enjoyed it and REALLY felt worked out! The instructor is good and the work-outs are perfectly paced. It was actually FUN which means I'll stick with it :)  Highly recommended!",1251417600,,689,4.468253968253968

However, I bought my fitness ball separate from the DVD because it was less expensive. Big mistake.

My fitness ball seems to be smaller than Kimberly's. Although I can do most of the exercises, there are parts where she is leaning forward on her ball, which I can't do.

This one is my favorite and I find that I do this about 3 times a week.  The instructor is great and not at all annoying.  Kimberly is encouraging and fun.  And the 10 min for each segment flies by so before you know it, you have done a 30 min workout.  My favorite segments are the upper body, abs (and I HATE ab work), and flexibility.

The cardio section is fantastic and really gets your heart pumping.
The weights section is also impressive and I would suggest for novices to use light weights as by the 3rd set your arms feel like dropping off!

This DVD also gives you the option of customising your workout by mixing up the sessions and by doing so there is the right amount of time to have a drink and catch your breath in between.

This is one of the best all-round workouts I have come across.  The instructor is one of the better ones as well.  Kimberly cues well, has a sense of humour and sounds like she knows her stuff.  I will be looking for more of her workout DVDs.",1234742400,,702,4.28030303030303

I especially like the 10 minute aspect of it, because you can choose which areas to focus on or you can do the whole workout at one time. It's versatile and because the sections are only 10 minutes each, I am more motivated to do them. I can also stop after I've done a few areas if I get interrupted by work, for example, and come back later to complete the other sections. Very convenient and works with my schedule. I like the exercises with the ball as well. This is the first workout with a stability ball that I've done and I enjoy it. The teacher is personable and motivating.",1232496000,,670,4.2421875

My favorite one is the Flexibility section since I was able to pick this one up the most quickly for some reason so I can use it more often than the others as of right now where I am in the practice with the ball, though I have also using the Core also and have been enjoying the ab work.

2606150,4,B000GEIRB4,"this is a very good dvd, i would say for an intermediate level. i was not at beginner level when i introduced it into my weekly exercise routine (3 times a week power walking, 3 days a week, 10 minute solution dvd, which i vary), and the first couple of days afteward, my ribs hurt when i sneezed!
she is a good instructor and fairly easy to follow.
*she has the lower body workouts which are effective, but not too difficult for someone who is already in shape.
*i like the arm/shoulder routine very much. it is the first arm routine i've seen in the 10 minute series where you are using weights for a total of 8 minutes straight, with no break. it is true that you can not switch the weights during the routine, unless you want to miss some of the reps. just use whatever weights are right for u. it's become easier as i've gotten used to it, but was quite challenging initially; still makes me break a sweat, though. and seems to be great at shaping your arms and shoulders very very nicely!
*AB routine excellent and very effective. i like starting with a total of 64 crunches on the ball! during the AB section, i do have some trouble keeping the ball in place during the oblique crunches, it seems to slip out of place, when i lean sideways on it.
*cardio routine fast and fun, overall. not terribly difficult; there were a few harder segments - pulse and jumps, jacks with ball, but overall, not too tough to keep up with.

a few negatives:
* at times, her cueing is not great. she will say, now we'll add a shoulder press here, and then she won't add it till she's done 2 more bicep curls, while you've been ready to do the shoulder press already. you have to get used to that.
her counting during the pulse and jump reps in the cardio segment is NOT good AT ALL. she counts 4, 3, 2 jump, however; she is pulsing down 4, 3, 2 , ONE and then jumping. make sure you count on your own for FOUR pulses. even she confuses herself with it, and at one point, she pulses for only 3 and then jumps, and messes up on 2 reps.
* i also dislike that there is virtually NO cool down stretches at all. in other 10 min. solution dvd's i use, there are a few cool down seconds, without taking away from the efficiency of the routines. for example, in the AB segment, after the 10 min. workout, she has u do a child's pose curl and that is it. after the cardio routin, you also have a couple of stretches to very quickly bring your heart rate down.

one more point, i have a hearing loss and wear 2 hearing aids. although i can hear the tv when it's on, it's tough for me to understand new words, esp. during a fast paced workout and I am very pleased with the closed captioned on the dvd! a nice surprise, since the first one i have - target toning for beginners, does not have closed captioned.

overall, i LUV the 10 minute solution series. Of all the dvd's i have in the series (target toning for beginners, tone trouble zones & hot body boot camp - amy bento, and this one) i do the first four segments (don't have the extra time for the final stretch segment...). i do recommend this dvd and think it's a fun, effective way to change up your routine.",1226707200,,3146,4.2052980132450335

2606166,5,B000GEIRB4,"I'm in relatively good shape and this video gives me a solid workout.  The instructor doesn't have an annoying voice; she IS... jolly?

It has five sections and gives you the option to pick and choose to form a ""program"" at the beginning, and then it'll play them in the order you picked (so you don't have to keep going back to the menu to play a section again or to skip some).  Or you can do them all, or you can do one at a time.

The sections are:

-Butt and Thigh Tone-Up
-Arms and Shoulder Sculptor
-Firm, Flat Abs
-Total Body Fat Burner
-Ultra Stretch

The sections sort of overlap because it's hard to isolate one muscle for every move she's got for the ball because it's such a big tool, but that's a good thing.  It lets me work out without overtaxing one muscle and getting frustrated.  She's got fun moves and routines for the ball.  I enjoy doing the video.  It's easy for the first few minutes, but then ends up with me feeling like I really did some work.",1218931200,,971,4.228260869565218

2606171,3,B000GEIRB4,"The exercise part is fine, but there are a few things that make this a ""three"":
Part of the exercise sequences have you swinging the ball overhead - unless one is remarkably short, it is necessary to have very high ceilings in the exercise space (not the ""normal"" 8 foot ceilings).
The pump provided is flimsy.
The ball ""off gases"" for about a week.

All of the problems are manageable - just annoying.",1210204800,5,402,4.506849315068493

You would think that using the fitness ball that it would be an easy workout, but it is not.  I can feel the burn in my muscles in all the segments, and my heart rate pumping in the cardio section.  One of the advantages to this workout is that it is intense but still easy on the joints.  I have lupus so I need something that doesn't stress my joints and the ball really reduced the impact on my joints, while still working my muscles.  My sister and I do the dvd together and we both break out into a sweat and are breathing hard by the end.

I do recommend getting a fitness ball that is really stiff.  If your ball is too soft, or squishy, some of the moves will be impossible to perform.",1210118400,,966,3.9637305699481864
2606173,4,B000GEIRB4,"I like this DVD, but only when combined with other fitness DVDs. Usually I'll do 10 minutes of this one to warm up or cool down, then pop in a cardio dvd or a more intensive 10 minute solutions -- like carb burner -- and do a couple of sections of that, followed by a cool down.

The legs section on this is a great warmup for your legs, especially the hamstrings. If you do this one and then go for a hike the blood will already be flowing to your muscles! I also liked the abs because it forced me to do 10 min of abs on the ball whereas normally I'll just drop down and do a few crunches.

I agree with one of the other reviewers that the weights she uses in the arms section are unrealistic. I just change out 5 pound and 10 pound weights and don't worry about doing every single rep, as long as I feel challenged.  If you want a good weights workout, stick with Jari Love.

The instructors seem to be consistently enthusiastic without being too cloying and help keep you motivated.  This particular DVD is fairly challenging even for someone who works out regularly like myself, and it offers a good break from your usual workout if that's what you're looking for. You can always rely on these DVDs to have a sufficient warm-up and cool down and brief stretches at the end of each segment, so it's all very low-impact and safe if followed correctly. I also have the pilates band 10 Minute DVD, which I would also highly recommend.

2606191,5,B000GEIRB4,"I've been working out daily for over 11 years and recently got a stability ball to work into my exercise rotations.

I have several Stability Ball dvd programs and thought this one would be good to add into the mix.

I was thoroughly impressed with it!

I generally like to combine several segments together and love the flexibility the program gives me in how I can organize the workouts in any sequence I want.

Each 10 minute routine is self contained as well so on a day where where I might just want to do only one of the programs from this dvd and maybe then do some other type of exercise I know that I have the option of doing just one of them and that it'll stand up on it's own.

For someone who may be seriously limited on time I believe you can do 20 minutes of this program a day and see real benefits. Just the lower body and upper body workouts on this program will give you plenty of challenge to build strength in both areas while working your core at the same time. You could do that combination three days a week and then maybe combine the other workouts to do in different combinations on the in between days.

With 10 minute solutions there's never an excuse for ""not having enough time"", even if you only did one section per day, just about EVERYONE has 10 minutes to spare to take care of the body you must live with 24-7 for the rest of your life! :)

This is an awesome video, and I always end up doing at least 2 or 3 10-minute segments each time!  The instructor moves rapidly which is nice (no boring downtime), and at the end of 10 minutes I have worked up a sweat...especially with the Cardio section.

I have done all 5 segments together, and broken up in to targeted areas when I'm short on time.  I love that there is a 10-min segment for the total body, so if I feel really lazy or rushed I can still hit all areas (and not just abs/butt/arms, though you can isolate those, too).  For each segment, there is some repetition, but that splits up the exercises (so you do 3 circuits of all arm movements instead of 50 bicep curls in a row).  The only thing I'd change is adding a countdown timer (as used in the ""Quick Fix"" series)... but 10 mins goes by quickly in these high-energy, positive workouts--and they make me sweat, which was my main goal!",1191196800,3,803,4.555555555555555

2606195,5,B000GEIRB4,"A description of the video has already been impressively done by many reviewers before me. I, like them, find the short 10-minute segments that you can program the way you like to be its most attractive feature. This, being said, I don't want to negate the excellent stage presence of Kimberly Spreen, the leader of the exercises. Before I owned the Fitness Ball Workout DVD, I used an aerobic exercise video of hers called Fast Cheetah. Her calm, cheerful, and encouraging style keeps me going when the going gets rough. I disagree with those who say this is a good beginner DVD, however. The segments are tough and even though they are short, they cannot be completed by someone unfamiliar with the exercise ball or who have not built up their aerobic capacity. I run an exercise class at my church and beginners do not have this right away. Before using the stability ball, I work on increasing my students' aerobic capacity. Once this is developed, I use the Basic Step DVD by Cathe for beginning work on the ball. It takes over a month for many novices to be able to balance and do some simple sit-ups and leg raises on the ball. While they are learning to balance on the ball, I have them learn their abdominal exercises on a mat. Once the aerobic capacity, abdominal strength and balance has begun to develop, we put it all together. Now we're ready for 10 Minute Solution: Fitness Ball Workouts with Kimberly Spreen!

Here, a lot of good instructors do that - Jillian Michaels for example - great fitness knowledge, completely off the beat, it simply doesn't flow!

As for this DVD, I was really pleased, split into a couple sections - upper body, lower body, core, stretches, very good selection of exercise, decent number of reps, good teaching points.

I'm over 50 and found some of the other workouts put too much strain on my hips.  However, I do the upper body workout along with my cardio workout on the bike.  It makes a good pair for me.

2606211,5,B000GEIRB4,"This video does everything it advertises.  I use it for 10-20 minutes a day, 5 days a week and I'm getting results in just over a month.  The ab routine is exceptional.  The lower body and cardio workouts both get your heart pumping a bit (especially if you use big movements).  The stretch section is thorough.  I could really feel my arm muscles burn in the upper body portion with the right size weights for me.

I tried the 'as seen on tv' core stability ball workout and it was great, too, but I was never able to customize it to my needs and time constraints.  Also, they would send a new video to me every other month, whether it would fit for me or not -- and if it did not fit for me, they would give me the option of sending it back -- on MY dime.  This program never gets boring and I can certainly find 10-20 minutes in my day to do this workout on the weekdays, and I walk with my daughter on the weekends.  When I do finally feel like it is too much of a routine, I'm going to try the 10 Minute Yoga Solution to mix and match with this one just to bring something different into the mix.  It is definitely straight forward and efficient.  Do remember, however, even if you only work out for 10 minutes, there is no cool down at the end of each section.  Do some slow pacing around and slow, deep breathing stretches afterward for 5 minutes or so to get your heart rate back to an acceptable level.

A final thought...., if you don't care about anything else I've said, do know that out of the 22 exercise videos I've purchased (cardio, dance, Latin, bellydance, yoga, taichi, qigong -- I like trying new things), this is the fastest working fitness solution I have ever used!",1179014400,25,1689,4.240625
2606212,4,B000GEIRB4,"Just to let you know, that I didn't buy the DVD online. I was at Ross the other day and saw the DVD (Ross is great for cheap workout DVD's).  I had no idea what the DVD would be like, but since the stability ball that I bought from Walmart didn't come with a DVD, I decided to give this one a try and for 4.99, even if it sucked it wouldn't be a big deal.

Well needless to say the DVD did not suck at all.  I work out pretty regularly and I still found it challenging, but not too challenging that a beginner couldn't do it.  Just when you are starting out do not panic when you feel like you are losing your balance or doing a little shaking.  This is just your body saying take your time and you will get it.

If you haven't bought your stability ball yet, make sure you get one that is appropriate for your height.  If you are under 5'5"" then you should get

the 55 cm ball, if you are taller, than get the 65 cm ball.  I am just under 5'5"", I bought the smaller ball first and it wasn't big enough, I have really long legs so I needed the bigger ball.  I would suggest when you buy the ball if you purchase it from a store with a liberal return policy.  I bought mine from Walmart and I had no trouble exchanging it for the larger ball.

I am glad that I bought the DVD and have been telling everyone about it. Just make sure your local discount store doesn't have it before you order it here, it will save you on shipping and the price.  But, if you can't find it go ahead and order it here, it is worth it!

2606238,4,B000GEIRB4,"Fitness Ball Workouts is a sequence of five short fitness routines, each of which use a stability ball.  Because this DVD is part of the 10 Minute Solution series, each workout is only 10 minutes long, and the fully programmable feature allows you to mix and match up to six segments to create your own, completely customized routine--very nice!  None of the segments have formal warm-ups or cool-downs, but most do prepare you with a few moves in the beginning and then add some quick stretches at the end.  I've provided a brief overview for each of the five routines below:

1. Lower Body.  Although this segment uses no weights, it was probably the most challenging of the five.  Kimberly begins with simple squats and side-to-side lunges, but she eventually adds in bouncing the ball and raising it overhead; combined with the high number of repetitions, you'll be really working here.  Next comes some glute work while lying face down on the ball, and finally, there is a tough hamstring portion performed lying with your feet on the ball.

2. Upper Body.  This segment was probably the most disappointing, especially given that Kimberly uses such light weights (I believe she is using 3#).  She begins by warming up the upper body with push-ups (an easier version with hands on the ball) and then moves into an upper body circuit.  The circuit includes rows, tricep kickbacks, bicep curls, shoulder presses, side raises, and front raises; it is repeated three times, each time adding a few new moves such as flyes/rear flyes.  Kimberly moves quickly, which makes it difficult to vary your weights as needed (I tried to switch between 5# and 8#).

3. Core.  Kimberly does warm you up here with some spinal rolls and core twists holding the ball.  She performs several sets of crunches while seated on the ball, adding a twisting move to target the obliques.  More oblique work follows while lying sideways over the ball, and then Kimberly moves to the floor for additional crunches, this time passing the ball from feet to hands.  Some brief back work follows (kneeling while leaning forward on the ball), and then Kimberly finishes with plank work (arms/hands on ball).

4. Cardio.  This segment begins with squats and lunges, rolling the ball in front of you for balance.  Kimberly adds in bouncing the ball and tossing it overhead, which was kind of fun.  She then ups the intensity with some impact moves such as jacks (holding the ball overhead) and plyo squat jumps (hands on the ball).  There is a brief interval where you continue to work while seated on the ball, but then it's back on your feet for more jumps, hopping out to plank with your hands on the ball.  This segment ends with a squat and roll over the ball plus a few quick stretches.  Although this routine was fairly intense, my HR was only in my target zone for about half the workout (5 minutes).  Also, it took up quite a bit of room in my small space.

5. Flexibility.  In this final segment, Kimberly leads you through a series of stretches using the ball.  There is more of a lower body emphasis, beginning with lunges/hip flexor stretches as well as some standing hamstring stretches.  There are a few upper body stretches performed seated on the ball, but for some reason, Kimberly moves very quickly through these and does not hold them for as long as the lower body stretches.

Overall, although these were generally solid, well-designed routines, I didn't really enjoy this workout.  I'm not sure that the 10-minute format works well for mixing strength and cardio; an all-strength program might have been better.  However, I would recommend this video to those who like Kimberly, enjoy using the ball, and prefer to break their workouts into shorter segments; the fact that the routines are programmable is definitely a huge plus as well.",1156982400,239,3827,4.786585365853658

8131121,4,B000GEIRB4,"These are just so-so exercises.  It's good to change up your routine but I'm not wild about this one.  The 10 Minute Solution series is a good one and I like the variety, but I probably wouldn't buy this one again just because it's meh.  The core workout hurt my back so I had to do part of it on the floor instead of the ball. If you're out of shape and just starting to exercise you might like it better than I do.",1467158400,,416,3.9285714285714284

8131124,5,B000GEIRB4,"I love the 10 minute video series! This DVD is wonderful because it incorporates a stability ball into the exercises, which makes them more challenging. Some of the 10 minute videos are a bit too easy, but the inclusion of the stability ball into the exercises pushes this one up a notch. It's not just used for crunches but is incorporated creatively (tossing it up, bouncing it, moving side to side with it, etc). Ultimately this is a video I use on a ""light"" day of exercise (I generally run or do a more difficult P90x-style workout video). But it's fun, effective, and the trainer has a nice, neutral personality that is pleasant and encouraging (and not off-putting like some DVD trainers).",1457568000,,696,4.713114754098361
