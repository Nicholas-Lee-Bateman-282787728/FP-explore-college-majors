8086007,4,B000BF0DH4,Great way to fine tune your TV. Real easy to do.,1484092800,,48,3.4545454545454546
8086008,3,B000BF0DH4,"This is adequate for a beginners setup. Can't help but feel that this would have been a better fit if my home theater were 10 years old. It does help for the general settings, but not really for newer HDTV's.",1299888000,,208,4.225
8086009,5,B000BF0DH4,Did not want a DVD that was highly technical. Provided easy solutions to help me make adjustments.,1266796800,2,98,4.823529411764706
8086010,3,B000BF0DH4,"Great idea, but didn't really do anything that my receiver couldn't, just verified that I had it set up properly!  Oh well.  It also took some guess work to figure out how to really do what they wanted you to do... not a tool more of a toy!",1203206400,5,240,3.9791666666666665
8086011,2,B000BF0DH4,"Should you purchase this audio/video equipment set-up disk, be prepared to feel almost alone during the task. The screens are generally helpful, but can sometimes leave you asking, ""Couldn't they explain this process a little better?"" For TV display settings, the task is best accomplished by pausing ""Ultimate"" and accessing your TV's set-up menu. This instruction is not well explained and discovering it for yourself can result in re-visiting the same Ultimate track repeatedly until the task is completed. Prior knowledge of the HDTV display setup menu and repeat function on your DVD player are good to know. You may require several visits to some Ultimate set-up screens before moving on to the next chapter.

The audio portion is entertaining, although brief. Dolby Digital 5.1 and THS are explained well enough to discover whether your receiver and/or DVD player are capable of processing one or both of these audio formats.

To conclude, this diminutive, basic tool helps only marginally to increase your watching and listening pleasure beyond the factory presets.",1155513600,35,1073,5.305882352941176
8086012,4,B000BF0DH4,"Not a ton of features, but did improve performance of a new, high-quality LCD HDTV.",1153353600,12,83,4.6
