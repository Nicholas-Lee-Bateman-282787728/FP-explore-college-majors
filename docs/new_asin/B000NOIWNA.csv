8180220,1,B000NOIWNA,"I really love orchestral music and ballet. However, I really hate opera singing and this is loaded with it. I would probably love it if not for the operetic singing...",1490054400,,167,4.6
8180221,2,B000NOIWNA,"It took me several weeks to get through this unimpressive production. It has been such a torture that I couldn't last more than a few minutes at a time, and gave up with 20 minutes left. The only reason this was released was Thielemann. He adopts very slow tempi, and finds a ""spiritual"" angle to this work. One can write volumes about the subtlety and refinement of the orchestral playing. If you like H&G as a mini-Parsifal, this is for you, but if you are looking for a children's opera, for fun, you will not find it here. The singers are good but some are poorly cast for video. They mostly just stand or sit and deliver, and the camera work is very basic and static. Vienna doesn't have the stage-lip tracking robotic camera that the MET inaugurated and that even smaller houses now have. Not every house has that camera, but IIRC this video has the camera locked on the singers for long minutes, changing at most from closeups to midrange but without changing angles. It is not pleasant to watch some of the singers at all, let alone for long, static minutes, in close-up and mid-range. It is not pleasant to watch anything here: The production is cheap, unimaginative, has no flair; it's just bland. It does not satisfy either as a traditional production or as a new take. It captures nothing of the fears, humor or bite of this work. I found the whole business painfully and unbearably boring. There are many annoying H&G productions. For sheer, good humored fun nothing still beats Bruce Bonnell's MET 1982 video (in English) with Frederica von Stade, Judith Blegen and Rosalind Elias. Thomas Fulton at the pit reaches at the MET at 103 minutes the right proportion between the light and sinister aspects of the work, that Thielemann drags here at 113 minutes. The picture and sound are up to today's standards, but the Wiener Staatsoper has IMO the best acoustic in the world for a large house, at least the best balanced, and none of this is captured here.",1483920000,3,1968,4.6257142857142854
8180222,5,B000NOIWNA,"This live performance was recorded in 2015 at the Vienna State Opera under Christian Thielemann. The actual recording is strikingly realistic giving depth to the sound-stage and excellent vocal and instrumental timbres. The camera work is crisp and detailed giving a clear sense of involvement for the viewer without being in any way invasive of the performers. The sound is presented in DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 as well as PCM stereo Subtitles are provided in English, Native German, French, Spanish and Korean.

The stage director, Adrian Noble, has made a point of creating a believable child-based production that brings both drama and fun to the proceedings. His long experience as artistic Director of the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1990-2003 has no doubt under-scored his obvious ability to create a scenario that connects with an audience without having to resort to strange concepts. In this he is ably abetted by costume designer Anthony Ward.

The very informative and interesting booklet takes the form of interviews with both the conductor Christian Thielemann and, separately, Adrian Noble who are individually able to express their intentions at some length. Unity of purpose becomes apparent. Particularly interesting is Thielemanns stress on the need to keep a close eye on proportion when handling the dynamics of the fairly large orchestra. There is a constant need to stop it from overpowering the on-stage activities.

The concept of setting this production in Victorian times as an era, rather than in any detail, allows the use of the circular imagery of a lanterna magica projector to lead into each of the three acts. In this way a link is made between the privations of the Hansel and Gretel story and the experience of many children living at the notional period. This lends a suggestion of reality to the folk tale and its general setting.

The performers are all well-chosen. The two children, Daniela Sindram and Ileana Tonca, are not allowed to become cartoon characters  Hansel in particular is restrained to naughtiness rather than wickedness and Gretel is realistically slender in build. The father, Adrian Erod, is cheerfully believable and his love of beer is clearly a trial for his wife. His wife, played by Janina Baechle, is clearly at the end of her tolerance driven by extreme poverty. By this time she, unlike any of the other characters, has no sense of humour left, and she presents rather an ominous figure. This is reinforced by her dominant physique which makes the references by her husband as little mother rather doubtful.

The witch, Michaela Schuster, presents a cheerful rather than a villainous protagonist. She obviously relishes her role and is fun to watch. Her eventual demise is amusing rather than horrifying or burdened with vindictiveness. The remaining roles are equally well presented and performed with a most attractive sense of magic surrounding them  Sandman, the Dew Fairy and the 14 angels who jointly look after Hansel and Gretel overnight in the forest.

Without wishing to spoil the sense of unveiling delights in terms of the overall presentation, one has to mention the very lovable characterisation of the moon projected onto the backdrop. This is a joyous production with much beauty and one where everything seems to proceed to a celebratory conclusion of secure warmth for all.

Collectors should applaud the far more affordable price being asked for this disc (UK), either as Blu-ray as reviewed here, or DVD. This must be further reason for praise due to Euroarts for this incentive. It offers a clear challenge to other labels still expecting premium prices. There are several new Euroarts issues at these reduced prices recently available and reviews will be following shortly!

This is a presentation of the fairy story that will give safe musical and dramatic pleasure to children of all ages including the retired!",1475366400,2,3904,5.1242138364779874
8180223,3,B000NOIWNA,"Purchased this version based on the reviews above, but find that I cannot completely agree with them.  The music, singing and acting are top notch, but I was very disappointed in the sets.  They look like something you would see at a local amateur production.  Very minimal.  Sorry.",1294185600,,282,4.8125
8180224,5,B000NOIWNA,"In the past decade or so there has been a tendency to sweep away the fairy tale trappings of this story and redress it in modern terms.  In the past few decades we've seen Hansel and Gretel as everything from first generation immigrants lost in New York's Central Park to tykes lost in a house of walking trees and captured by a tenor who runs an industrial kitchen.  While I'm all for fresh looks at classic works the risk of doing so with a fairy tale like this is that the sets and costumes get so far afield from its origins that I can't help but wonder if the children in the audience have any idea as to what is going on.

What makes this production so refreshing and wonderful is that it is a happy blend of the contemporary and the traditional.  While the standard scenic representations are gone, what remains are images that convey the feeling that the originals did.  Hansel and Gretel don't find a gingerbread house but find themselves in a candyland just as tempting. This is one of my favorite operas and I would have to say this is now my favorite version of it.  Beautifully sung, perfectly directed and the transfer and sound are gorgeous!",1212192000,2,1156,4.454976303317536
8180225,5,B000NOIWNA,"I loved this production!  Hansel, Antigone Papoulkas who gets five stars herself, and Gretel, Anna Gabler, were wonderfully bratty and childlike in their appearance, behavior and mannerisms, unlike the sappy performances in other productions, e.g., with Edita Gruberova or Fredericka Von Strade.  The parents, played to perfection by Hans-Joachim Ketelsen and Irmgard Vilsmaier, were great singers.  The witch, Iris Vermillion, appeared as a beautiful vamp who soon pulled off her red wig and put on creepy gloves to transform her hands, covered her skin-tight red gown with a frumpy dress complete with built-in hunchback, and donned coke bottle eyeglasses to show her blindness, etc.  Bald and creepy!  Great acting, great singing by everyone.

The lighting effects, staging, choreography and direction made this a first class, entertaining opera.  The music, conducted by Michael Hofstetter, was perfect from start to finish.  Also appealling were the frequent audience shots of cute little toddlers paying rapt attention.

I've seen a few versions of this opera and this is the only one I'd recommend or watch more than once.",1189555200,9,1129,5.442528735632184
8180226,4,B000NOIWNA,"This new DVD gives us a real directorial find in Katharina Thalbach.  She has approached this very familiar and beloved opera with fresh insights, giving us a combination of childhood nightmares and adult reflections on them.  She doesn't reset the opera or update it.  The children act like the little brats they are and learn to fend for themselves in a very scary world.  The Witch begins by trying to seduce the children (particularly the pubescent Hansel) and soon reveals herself to look like something out of Roald Dahl's ""The Witches"" - bald, self-important, dangerous.  Iris Vermilion does a great job with a role that is usually overplayed.  She is comical and repulsive all at once.  The parents are excellent in their rather stylized make-up. Irmgard Vilsmaier should have a bigger career than she does now, singing with the type of steadiness and security so often missing in today's Wagnerian productions.  The children sing well if not memorably (Gretel is strained on top and doesn't have the top D - it's optional anyway).  Those who want more traditional fare should stick with the Met's beautiful 1982 production (OOP right now) or Everding's lovely studio version (DG).  But Thalbach's version deserves to be heard and discussed.  It is never outrageous and always thought-provoking.",1181865600,10,1303,5.099056603773585
