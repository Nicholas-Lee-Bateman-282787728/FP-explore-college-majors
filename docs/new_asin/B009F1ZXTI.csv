5323794,3,B009F1ZXTI,"Romantic comedies are so cookie cutter nowadays that I rarely find any of them really good or great.  For the most part I find them just okay. I already predicted the ending to this movie (anyone can really) but it has a charm to it. The two leads have chemistry and I LOL at several scenes (like the bachelor and bachelorette parties). Mo Gaffney has a small but HILARIOUS part.  If you're in the mood for something cute and generally like the romantic comedies the Family and Lifetime channels air during the holidays, then I recommend this.",1356220800,,543,4.587628865979381
5323795,2,B009F1ZXTI,"This movie is so bad I don't even know where to begin. It's like I was watching something directed by a high school student. Its very low quality in sound and cinematography. It had strange awkward scenes that didn't make a lot of sense. The acting by the 2 main characters was fine, I wouldn't mind seeing them in something else. But the rest of the acting stunk! The plot actually could have been good, but the low quality of the directing, writing, producing, acting.....ugh! What a waste of time!",1356134400,3,500,4.566666666666666
5323796,1,B009F1ZXTI,"Very overtly sexual without actually showing the physical act.  Constantly talking about the details of sex, etc.",1514419200,,113,5.647058823529412
5323797,1,B009F1ZXTI,Not a family film. Too many unnecessary sexual references. Bad acting and not worth your time.,1514246400,,94,4.9375
5323798,1,B009F1ZXTI,"First: This is NOT a Christian movie. It's a mock-Christians movie. Mildly amusing. Accents were way too strong most of the time. Girls were one-dimensional. Good, traditional plot, stupid storyline and just plain bad dialogue. The lead was handsome. I hope he gets some better jobs from this.",1514073600,,293,5.125

5323800,2,B009F1ZXTI,"This looked cute, and during the movie ""Christianity"" was talked about however, it was very inappropriate. They never showed anything bad, but it was hinted at, and not a subtle hint either.",1512950400,2,190,4.96875
5323801,2,B009F1ZXTI,"Disappointed.  Seemed like a cute idea but it was downright inappropriate at the beginning amount taking Christ's name in vain.  Call me old fashioned, I don't care.  I was looking for a sweet Hallmark like movie and this wasn't it.  The acting was also not the best.",1512432000,3,267,4.617021276595745

5323803,1,B009F1ZXTI,"I like flics where the high school sweet hearts end back up together, but this movie was awful! The original story line sounded great, but there were so many scenes and references to sex that didn't need to be there and were irrelevant to the plot. Not worth it.",1512000000,,262,4.36734693877551
5323804,1,B009F1ZXTI,This is so bad that I couldn't watch iT MORE THAN 15 MINUTES.,1511827200,,61,3.769230769230769
5323805,2,B009F1ZXTI,"So I didn't finish the movie. I watched maybe the first 15 minutes, so perhaps my issues were resolved. But there were a few ethnically insensitive jokes that rubbed me the wrong way (one about a woman wearing a burka because ""Daddy was going to take [her] to Saudi Arabia on oil business"" and another about how the ""Chinese don't celebrate the birth of Christ,"" which honestly I couldn't tell if that was directed at Chinese people in general or the supposedly ignorant Texans, so that tells you something about the acting and delivery.) Are either of these a huge problem? Nope, but they were cheap jokes at the expense of other cultures that served no purpose to the plot, and it annoyed me. Also, the Texas accents were ridiculous, and the guys were being super creepy at the bachelor party. Like stop. I chose this movie because I did NOT want doofy dudes who can't figure out how to entertain themselves without the help of strippers, and because I wanted to support a movie directed by a woman. OH and the first scene involves a girl going down on her boyfriend. Again: I'm in the market for wholesome Christmas rom-com here. Go down on whomever you please, but NOT IN MY WHOLESOME CHRISTMAS MOVIE.",1511395200,,1205,4.609302325581395
5323806,1,B009F1ZXTI,"Within the first two minutes, the girlfriend is doing a blow job to her boyfriend!!!!! How do you call this a FAMILY MOVIE?????",1510358400,,127,4.565217391304348
5323807,1,B009F1ZXTI,"For a supposed family movie the first 2 minutes is complete trash.  Terrible acting, terrible accents, terrible show.",1508976000,,117,5.5
5323808,4,B009F1ZXTI,"All right. Typical romcom where lost love returns and causes emotional chaos to former lover. Good message about not 'settling', causing a future loveless marriage, as so many do.  Unlike others I watched this with, I think the real 'cheating' is to marry someone you don't love. Be fair and let your intended move on to find a guy who loves only her for always. Warning, offensive material, light crudeness and politically incorrect situations. The easily offended or drama inclined should pass on this one, unless of course your a ranter looking to be offended.

5323809,1,B009F1ZXTI,"There's a section in this movie that has a couple lambasting ""A-rabs"", eurotrash, homosexuals, and scientists while the two main characters watch on, not saying anything as the couple spews racist and ignorant rhetoric. I have absolutely no idea why this is available on Amazon and am extremely disappointed that the company let this movie through. Not only is the acting poor, the storyline weak (the groom tries to sleep with the main female character the night before his wedding), and the message horrible (cheat on your fiancee the day before the wedding to find your true love), but there's a nice dash of racism in there too.",1507939200,,632,4.861111111111111

5323811,2,B009F1ZXTI,I thought it was fair until the end which was horrible because the truth why they broke up years ago doesn't come out to Amy. I wouldn't waste time watching it like I did.,1504310400,,171,4.0588235294117645
5323812,1,B009F1ZXTI,amateurish writing and acting- ghastly.  IF it were meant as tongue in cheek then MAYBE but I couldn't stick around long enough to find out.  I'm a big fan of formulaic rom-coms and this was painful and cringe worthy,1503446400,,216,4.512820512820513
5323813,1,B009F1ZXTI,"This movie was offensive and crude, lacking in humor with a boring storyline. Every character was a poorly written, un-nuanced stereotype.

I really didn't get drawn in to any of the characters at all and for someone to want to try to rekindle a relationship that close to their wedding seems like a dirty dog.  It's really predictable, too. Not sure if the editing took out any good scenes or they just decided at one point that they were in too deep to give up.",1483920000,,493,4.114583333333333

5323919,3,B009F1ZXTI,"I generally enjoy these cheesy holiday movies (or I guess Hallmark Channel-esque), but this one was... not good. I would not go so far as to say bad, because the acting was not all terrible and the story line is what you would expect from this movie (a few parts were little racier than Hallmark movies).

Parts of the movie felt a little out of place or forced. There were a few slightly offensive jokes (poking fun at religion or foreigners), though I think I was more offended by the quality of the jokes rather than their content.

If you know you like crappy movies (which I typically do, but I was not super into this one), then I guess you can give it a shot. It kind of falls apart a little at the end, but I was using this movie to keep me company as I did chores, so it did do what I wanted.

NOTE: I would feel really embarrassed watching this in mixed company...lol...there are scenes that are a bit risqu. (Once again, not what I was expecting, but just enough to make it a little spicy.)

5323942,3,B009F1ZXTI,"One of the problems with this film is that the director apparently couldn't decide whether it should be a romantic comedy or a romantic drama. Additionally, the director was so concerned with the length of the film that she cut out approximately 5 critical minutes that would have gone a long way to clarifying certain situations and making things more sensible. We learn this from the Special Features section. She arbitrarily felt that this type of movie shouldn't be much more than 85 minutes which, on the face of it, is ridiculous.

When the film opens, Daniel Bonjour is in a serious relationship with his girl friend and about to propose. However, he is also looking after his sickly divorced father who suddenly has a heart attack and requires emergency care. Unable to leave him, DB sends a 12 something year old to tell his girl friend about his predicament. Unbeknownst to DB, the youngster has a serious crush on him and lies to the girl friend about the situation. The gf, without questioning anything, leaves for points beyond. She is angry and upset and so is her mother.  Fast forward 7 years. DB is now engaged to be married to the little girl (now grown up) whose father is wealthy and makes DB a manager of his business (to the consternation of DB's best friend who actually may have deserved the position). At this point, the viewer is entitled to wonder how in the world the young man or young woman who left him never bothered to get in touch during the 7 year period if, in fact, they were so much in love with each other.

On the eve of the nuptials to be, the original girl friend returns home and just happens to be staying in the same hotel as the planned wedding. She is now a succesful businesswoman. From here on, despite many bumps and a few laughs, one can guess what the ultimate outcome will be. Unfortunately, thanks to the poor editing and silly directorial decisions, the main characters are never informed as to what actually happened to cause the interruption 7 years earlier in their relationship. One gimmick the director employs is to have a scene suddenly go dark and then jump to the next one with no transition, thereby saving film time and any explanation. DB's father gives no inkling of his earlier illness which also seems strange.

I gave this film 3 stars instead of 2 based upon the performances of the two lead actors who could have really shined and displayed more chemistry with a different director. Since the movie was shot in 18 days, I also have to give everyone some extra credit. Daniel Bonjour, as the groom to be, was especially credible (one can see him in MIDNIGHT MOVIE where he also comported himself well). For those who would enjoy some very light romantic fluff and a few situational laughs (an ANIMAL HOUSE ripoff doesn't quite work), you could do worse. Buy an inexpensive Very Good copy. Finally, the title of this review will become self-explanatory once you see the film.",1372809600,3,2946,4.637931034482759
5323943,2,B009F1ZXTI,"When I watched this movie I had expected something fantastic, a romantic comedy.  When I finished watching this movie I still had expected something fantastic, a romantic comedy, but was unfortunately left disappointed.  It was like popping popcorn and finding that only half the bag had popped.  There was so much potential in the movie that was not captured.  Some of the acting was truly impressive but the plot lines were largely disappointingly executed.

There was a large gap in time that appeared to have been cut out in the name of shortening the length of the movie.  Other plot lines failed the basic common sense tests.  Do we really expect a girl madly in love with a boy to not call or contact their boyfriend?  Will she really drive off or will she drive over to say goodbye?  Amy's departure was disappointing and did not have the heart-wrenching drama that one would expect.  If it did it would have killed the plot line of a 11 or 12 year old girl pursuing an 18 year old man for the next 7 years.  ...and how long had Dixie and JB dated before tying the knot?  At least they had not hooked up when she was 16 and he was 23; that was clarified in the plot line.

This movie had a lot of potential, decent cinematography, some surprisingly good acting, but poorly assembled storyboarding and a plot line with more holes in it than a colander.",1358726400,,1359,4.475609756097561
5323944,5,B009F1ZXTI,"If you don't like movies like The Wedding Crashers, Bridesmaids, or Forgetting Sarah Marshal, then this movie is not for you.  It contains crude humor, sexual jokes and social, political and religious satire.  So if you are a sexually uptight holy roller, this movie may not be for you.  Everyone else, ENJOY!  There were some fun, laugh out loud moments, and great chemestry between the lead actors, funny supporting characters, and the pacing picks up fast and doesn't slow down until the end.  Like most romantic comedies, it is predictable, you know at the end the boy gets the girl, but finding out how it all goes down is what makes it so the fun!  It's also refreshing to see new up and coming actors in the leads.  And even with all that crude (sexual) humor, there is no nudity or sex, no bad language or cursing and no drug use.",1358467200,5,838,4.509933774834437
