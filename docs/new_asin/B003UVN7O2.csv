Can't wait for a sequel by this production team and actors.
Great film",1282435200,4,154,4.344827586206897

8406235,1,B003UVN7O2,"Wow this is a terrible movie. I don't recommend wasting time with this one. The positive ""reviews"" are clearly written by producers (I even notice they praise producers...haven't ever seen that done before!). The acting is seriously bad and characters are just not worth trying to figure out or get to like. It's just a time-waster...for viewers, the cast, the crew...everyone involved!",1437177600,,386,5.241935483870968

8406237,3,B003UVN7O2,The Brazen Bull was little better than the last movie I got  but as all way Michael was very good at playing a mad man,1373241600,,118,3.72
8406238,1,B003UVN7O2,"I can't help but wonder if some of the reviews here were written by people involved with the production of this movie, or their mothers.  Either that, or they saw a different movie than I did.  The acting in this movie was terrible--except for a good job by Michael Madsen.  The ""good"" characters were so unlikable, and played so poorly that I almost was on the side of the psycho guy.  There's a lot of running around in an empty building, a lot of gore, and not much of a plot.  I did watch to the end of the film, expecting an explanation, which when it came was pretty lame.  Don't waste your time.",1349568000,2,602,4.2368421052631575
8406239,3,B003UVN7O2,"Is nothing sacred anymore?  It's gotten to the point you can't even buy up rundown foreclosed properties with the intention of rezoning them for residential use and making millions of dollars without some whack job coming out of the woodwork and torturing and killing you nowadays, insisting that, through bribery and backroom deals you've caused him to lose everything in his life that meant anything, his family, his marriage, and the building that he was trying unsuccessfully to have rezoned for residential use himself.

This is the premise of the 2010 movie THE BRAZEN BULL, starring Jennifer Tisdale and Michael Madsen.  Tisdale plays Lauren, a young woman just getting started in the real estate business with her partner and fiancee Tyler.  They've recently acquired a large office building in downtown LA and are planning to have it zoned for residential use, put a lot of money into it with the intention of getting even more money out of it.  On this particular day they are doing a walk-through of the place--Lauren's friend Ashley has come along to document the doings with her video camera for some kind of documentary she's making--but almost as soon as they've got started, Tyler finds a room that's been plastered with photos of himself and Lauren, along with information about the building and the couple's family and friends.  Before he can get Lauren and get the hell out of there, Tyler is knocked unconscious.

Meanwhile Lauren and Ashley have found the body of their maintenance man, Carlos, disemboweled in the boiler room.  From there they find a room with a TV hooked up to a camera where Michael Madsen's maniac character can talk to them while he makes them watch him torture Tyler.

THE BRAZEN BULL wants to be more than it is.  It wants to have a message, it wants to be a violent epic (I'm sure the intention was that Madsen would channel his old RESERVOIR DOGS character for the torture scenes, which he does not), it wants to be a movie with a point.  The bad part is, that point, that message, that epic feel, is all squandered by a 30-minute buildup and then 50 more minutes of nothing at all.  There's no tension in the interrogation scene once Lauren and Ashley are tied up.  There's not even any build up to Ashley's death (spoiler, Ashley gets killed), it's just over and done with no fanfare.

And when the madman takes off to intercept Lauren's cop mother played by Rachel Hunter, Lauren's attempt at escape is carried off with absolutely NO real effort on Lauren's part.  He might as well have just told her ""Sit there, unbound, and don't move"" for all the struggle she had to put into getting away.

I kept trying to get into THE BRAZEN BULL, but the subtext of the movie was handled with all the subtlety of a bulldozer reinforced with bulletproof steel barreling through town.  This is yet another place where the film's short run time works against it; THE BRAZEN BULL wants desperately to SAY something, but it's just not given the room it needs to stretch out and get comfortable.

BRAZEN BULL is the brainchild of Douglas Efford-Argent, who has a small list of low budget movies to his name, like REALITY HORROR NIGHT and THE HOUSE, but who's biggest claim to fame is probably as a camera operator for STORAGE WARS.

The cast is a mix of names, almost-names and never-heard-ofs (Rachel Hunter and Madsen being the names, with Tisdale pulling a close second; sister to the Disney star, she's been in a few things I've seen, most notably the After Dark horror movie DARK RIDE.  David Frank Fletcher, whom I've never heard of played Tyler with Gwenolyn Garver pulling up the rear as Ashley . . . she also worked as editor of the movie) and I'm going to go out on a limb here and say the word of the day on set must have been, without fail every day, abandon, because these people certainly weren't holding anything back.

Thomas Bilyeu and Chris Van de Polder wrote the screenplay from the story by Efford-Argent and Nicholas Mark Harding (no, you've never heard of any of them, and you never will again), and a good 40% of the dialogue had to have come straight from the scriptwriting handbook chapter on tension.  Under ""What words to NEVER put in your characters' mouths.""  And what happens when we mix bad script with over-acting?  Class?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Class?

That's right: CRAP!

I will give THE BRAZEN BULL points for at least TRYING to say what it wanted to say, and for at least having the bulls to not flinch when it came to the gore, but unfortunately good intentions and decent special effects don't make up for a lackluster movie, and believe me, ""lackluster"" fits this movie to a T.",1346198400,,4648,4.661764705882353
8406240,3,B003UVN7O2,"I wanted to like BRAZEN BULL more than i do.  Michael Madsen as a psycho killer had lots of promise, but the script and co-stars did nothing to help him out.  Madsen's performance is highly stylized and not the least bit convincing.  His brutality is almost comical and by the end, he seems fed up--not with his character's plight--but with the film itself.
Jennifer Tisdale and David Fletcher are simply awful and Rachel Hunter ultimately wasted.  The complex plot has its good points but is ambiguous by its conclusion...and th post-credits ending a real copout.  It should have been better!",1302480000,,593,4.89
8406241,1,B003UVN7O2,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Wasted $$ on renting this one.  I didn't even care what happened to the characters because their acting was just that bad.,1295049600,3,170,4.3125
8406242,1,B003UVN7O2,"I bought this on the recommendation of the other reviewers. This is the worst film that I have ever seen in my entire life.  To quote another reviewer on About.com: ""grim, dull, poorly-made, torture retread, unoriginal, unlikeable characters""  ""Mediocre acting"" was also mentioned and that is being kind.",1294790400,,304,5.3125
8406243,5,B003UVN7O2,"If your looking for a thriller,this is for you. The whole movie was definitly keeping us on our toes....and on the edge of our seat. Excellent story plot,beleivable.
