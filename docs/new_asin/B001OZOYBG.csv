8331765,5,B001OZOYBG,"Excellent excercises and activities for treating low back pain.  I've recommended this tape for many years and had excellent feedback from those who've watched the video and followed the advice therein.  Originally I got this tape to treat my own injured back, and have purchased many copies through the years to lend to others (I don't always get them back!)  Both my general practitioner and neurologist expressed being ""impressed"" by the tape, and each ordered several copies to lend to patients - they each told me that all of their patients reported significant relief from pain after viewing and doing the exercises in the video.  My advice to all:  if any one exercise increases pain, skip it and go on to the next exercise.
