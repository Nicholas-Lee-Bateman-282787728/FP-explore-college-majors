4435664,5,B004NBHVNQ,South Riding was very interesting when shown on PBS here in St. Louis. Greatful to have it as part of my Dvd Library!,1307836800,,117,4.130434782608695
4435665,3,B004NBHVNQ,"This well-acted drama, based on a beloved novel, certainly has possibilities: Anna Maxwell Martin as the school's new headmistress, Penelope Wilton as her eventual ally on the town council, and David Morrissey as the handsome brooding hero are all excellent, as are the various youngsters playing the schoolgirls. The cinematography of the churning North Sea is spectacular. But too many unresolved plot-lines have been left hanging like tangled wires in an unfinished construction of a schoolroom. We get glimpses of characters and plot rather than fully developed characterisations and motivations. For example, in this production, the abrupt introduction of the woman, who was prepared to drop everything to keep house in a shanty for the rather unpleasant father of five children, seems to serve merely as a plot device to get Lydia back to school. As with the three new episodes of ""Upstairs-Donwstairs"", the writers have tried to stuff too many ideas into too short-a time slot.

Let us hope that this BBC trend does not continue!

P.S. There is a 1974 version (DVD issued in 2007), with the late great actress of British theatre, Dorothy Tutin, playing the Schoolmistress. Highly rated, this ""South Riding"" is on four discs and in thirteen episodes, an indication of what viewers are missing. Unfortunately it is available only in PAL, so unless one has a multi-region DVD player, one will be unable to see it on this side of the Pond.",1306454400,5,1442,5.054621848739496
4435666,1,B004NBHVNQ,"While the actors involved were first rate, there was nothing for them to do but wallow in one of the worst scripts I have ever seen produced by PBS.  The various plots remained undeveloped and often, pointless.  One kept hoping that some turn in the plot would make sense - it never did!  I would never watch this again or recommend it to a soul.  The scenery was lovely, but does not make up for the horrendous story.",1305676800,10,418,4.32051282051282
4435667,2,B004NBHVNQ,"I wish I could write a more positive review but I really feel only 2 1/2 stars is the best I can do.  The plot of South Riding would do Thomas Hardy proud except that he would have filled in the spaces.  There were so many possibilities here that were not explored adequately or at all and were brought to a hurried and jumbled end, and of course the overall tenor was grim.  I did like the actors--especially Anna Maxwell-Martin..  All the central characters were well acted--  David Morrissey and Penelope Wilton were both memorable but were constricted by the script.  I would very much like to see more of Maxwell-Martin because she is new to me.  The scenery was, as many have noted, stunning, and it certainly got across the dismal quality of life in that era.  However, there were just too many dangling story lines and too many things happening without adequate leadin or explanation, and it really was sooo depressing.",1305676800,21,927,4.644171779141105

4435670,2,B004NBHVNQ,"Although I liked the production and the characters, I feel the author made some implausible choices with the plot.  First, most patients with ? schizophrenia don't jump off tall buildings while normal when young as Robert's wife did.  Exactly what was wrong with Robert's wife was never developed, likely because of a lack of knowledge of psychiatric disease.  Also I found it very odd that Robert's daughter chose to go with her grandfather at the end, leaving behind the house she had lived in all her life and all the people she had ever known--unbelievable considering her extreme anxiety and previous clinging behavior!  And then the darkest part, the cliff breaks off and dumps Robert and his horse down to the sea!  The exact reverse of the male protagonist in Jane Eyre, whose wife dies, freeing him to remarry.  Overall a very unrealistic and unfulfilling story.",1305590400,6,871,4.931506849315069
4435671,1,B004NBHVNQ,South Riding was very disappointing! The plot is an undeveloped hodge-podge of clutter all crammed together.  The male characters are stiff and boring and one wonders why the creators would choose those actors at all for male-lead roles. None of the characters make me care about them at all!,1304467200,17,292,4.959183673469388
4435672,5,B004NBHVNQ,"Sarah Burton arrives in early 1930s a Yorkshire town, her hometown, to serve as headmistress in a girl's school. Is she an early feminist? The drama is conflicting, emotion interspersed, but the period telling is superb. Anna Maxwell Martin gives the Sarah character a believable struggle in this BBC adaptation of the last written book by Winifred Holtby. Equally stellar in performance is David Morrisey as Carne, a conservative farmer and politician initially opposed to Sarah. This farmer has a sick wife, a shy daughter, and plenty of opinion. Of course there is conflict as well as prejudicial issues dealing with others from the community and the school. Not really a romance, more of a study on characters and struggles of life in a time and place when one should know and keep their place.

There is politicking in the British style, especially through Alderwoman Beddows (Penelope Wilton). Council meetings do some havoc on the community and individual family situations. As a result, not everything turns up a bed of roses. There is struggle with recession. A truth quite realistic on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1930s. A nice period piece. Sit back and enjoy the characters and the interaction. Rural strength of people in a beautiful Yorkshire setting.

Character depth within the people of South Riding hamlet makes this worthy of 5 stars.",1301529600,55,1359,5.008849557522124

4435680,5,B004NBHVNQ,"I have just read all of the reviews to the film version of what is one of the most outstanding books written by Winifred Haltby. Winifred Haltby was closely associated with small towns in Yorkshire during the early part of the 20th Century and her book ""South Riding"" is a complex study of the development of local parish councils and how they conducted public business and developed a social system that precedes the welfare state now enjoyed by people who live in modern Britain. The book sets out to show rather than explain how much good, or harm, a local council can bring about for the inhabitants of a small area. Haltby was"" a campaigner for human mercy and justice""* and she recognizes the efforts of local councils to meet their obligations to the poor and needy as well as the well off. She is describing 'the administrative County of York"" and how it met and sometimes failed to meet the needs of its people. This is demonstrated within the context of each of the characters. Each character represents a constituent part of the whole panorama created by the story. This book is not entertainment nor is the film version that was made originally for a British television audience that may well understand its nuances since most British people are familiar with the machinations of the British council system.

The movie version of this book succeeds in that it concentrates the most important elements of the story into a relatively brief three-part series. I cannot believe that viewers and reviewers could not recognize that Mrs. Carne's return to her home is because Maythorpe has been turned into a mental hospital to serve the people of Kiplington. And the movie makes very clear she is beyond the benefits of more advanced treatment. And the death of Robert Carne: he suffers an horrendous accident when the cliff edge crumbles; he does NOT commit suicide. Midge ""calms down"" and appears to become a more normal child following her father's death because her rightful grandfather comes back to offer her a home with him where she knows she will live in comfort for the rest of her childhood. The grandfather is making up for his neglect of his own sick daughter, Midge's mother. He may also be about to repeat the mistakes made in the mother's childhood.

The movie conscientiously sets out to make the major points very clear. The levels of greed, hypocrisy, corruption, self-serving, serious concern for the community, and true altruism, are all clearly personified in the various characters. What is proved to the viewer is that wherever human beings try to organize themselves into a civilized society, there is no such thing as an ideal group of people. What this movie shows is that people are basically good and the events in human experience usually produce good at least for 90% of the beneficiaries.

When I set out to become a teacher of Literature a lifetime ago, I was determined to cast out the darkness of ignorance! This comment is one more attempt to be a beacon of understanding.

4435681,5,B004NBHVNQ,What a complete surprise when I saw this for the first time some time ago on Public Television.  I immediately bought a copy for my daughter and then decided I had to have one for myself as well.  A thorough delight.,1396483200,,216,4.2439024390243905

4435683,4,B004NBHVNQ,"South Riding happened to show up on PBS one night when nothing else interested me.  Though it seemed the dark side of human nature was around every corner in this series, it compressed the reality of a full life into a 3-part series.  Hopefully most people get a chance to smell the roses a bit in life, the most uplifting part was the ending.  All that said, I fully enjoyed the series.  I saw only the first 2 parts on PBS so I bought the 3-part series on DVD.  Maybe I'm a bit biased since I was raised in the Northeast of England with very happy childhood memories, the film was like touching bases again after these past 50+ years of not having lived there.  The acting was great.  Very good indeed.  Though set relatively early in the 1900s, you don't have to go back that far in time to have seen such swatches of poverty and people of extremely limited financial means living near those more fortunate.  The storyline was very good though dark but the uplifting ending makes watching the rest of it all seem well worthwhile.",1378166400,2,1032,4.417989417989418

I am sorry if they are going to have such adult  scenes at least they could warn you instead I had to turn it off afraid to continue for fear of more of the same...badly done from a director that I have come to admire.

4435686,3,B004NBHVNQ,"I attempted to watch this twice before I could get into it. The beginning is slow. It's filmed in low light and done in dark tones so it starts out with a depressing feel as well. Once it got going, I was riveted however. I am not sure how that happened really. The acting was good. The scenery was spectacular. I don't think I've ever seen a movie based in 1930's England where poverty reigned so that bit of culture was also interesting, but it was just one big, depressing event after another. Many parts of the story went to fast and weren't thoroughly explained while others just meandered along, so the pacing felt really off to me- especially everything after the funeral. While I was very engaged in the story, it also felt very unsatisfying. It ends with this really happy music, but I was feeling like, ""What's that all about?"" The good things at the end did not make up for all the rest of it. All in all, it's a strange movie.",1321228800,4,938,4.365714285714286

4435688,5,B004NBHVNQ,"South Riding is a three part serial from a long tradition of period dramas made for TV. However, it stands out from most of its peers as it based on the book of the same name by Winifred Holtby, which is a classic. In the 1930s Sarah returns to her native South Riding of Yorkshire from London, and is interviewed for the job of headteacher at a local girls high school which Ofsted would certainly describe as failing! Despite fundamental differences with some members of the interviewing panel she gets the job.

There are two different ways of rating this mini series. Taken in isolation it is absorbing and entertaining and is certainly worth Five Stars, and this is what I have based my rating on. However, there is no way that a book of this complexity can be adequately translated into three hours of TV viewing so of necessity, only some of the major strands can be picked up and to some extent developed in this time period. I would imagine that the previous TV series from the 1970s which ran to 13 parts was much more satisfactory in this respect. Therefore based on a judgement of how well the series reflects the book, we are probably looking at Two Stars.

The beauty of the book, which does translate to a large extent into the TV adaptation, is the superb portrayal of the diverse characters within this rural community. Some are major and memorable characters such as Lydia, the brilliant scholar from the shacks (temporary slum housing scheduled for demolition) with a difficult family background who like Sarah is new to the school - when her mother dies she struggles to keep her scholarship place at the school. Another key figure is Robert Carne, who has enormous pressures in his life with a mentally unbalanced wife and a delicate daughter as well as extreme economic difficulties and who develops a rapport with Sarah which initially appears unlikely. There are also a host of minor characters who enrich the community with their complex and varied individual quirks. This is all set against the background of the depressed economy of the 1930s and the strains within the community which this creates.

Like most of these TV mini series, this will be better viewed in one go with the boxed set rather than waiting a frustrating week to see the next instalment on TV. Provided you do not watch with too many pre conceived expectations you will thoroughly enjoy it. However, if you are looking for a series which reflects the book it is based on you are going to be sorely disappointed and would probably do best to avoid.",1320364800,4,2545,4.676339285714286
4435689,2,B004NBHVNQ,"This movie was a decent effort, but I was a little disappointed by how it ended, and how (SPOILER ALERT?) some story lines weren't really wrapped up.  And just a warning, there's a bit in this movie that would probably get it a PG-13 rating in the US.  A little different from some of the other BBC movies I've seen.",1319587200,3,316,4.25
4435690,2,B004NBHVNQ,"This is the weirdest period production I've seen in a while, and a terribly disappointing effort from the master of the adaptation, Andrew Davies. Fair warning: I'm including spoilers, because I can't adequately justify my complaints without them.

Firstly, the pros. Anna Maxwell Martin is bright, beautiful and interesting. Her costumes are so lovely I want them for myself, and she is a stellar actress. I have no complaints about her performance whatsoever (although I do have some issues with the character). David Morrissey is also excellent. He has a knack for portraying both the absolutely repulsive (ie. Bradley Headstone in 'Our Mutual Friend', Stephen Collins in 'State of Play') and the terrifically endearing (ie. Colonel Brandon in 'Sense and Sensibility') and sometimes both at once (friendly/murderous Nazi Gunther Weber in 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin'). In 'South Riding' he's utterly convincing as a brusque Yorkshireman. Other stand-out performances include the always marvellous Penelope Wilton, and Charlie May Clarke, who plays impoverished and heavily accented student Lydia Holly with such authenticity it's hard to believe she's not real.

The landscape is breathtaking, and the sweeping cinematography very impressive. The score is very dramatic too. In short, the production values generally are excellent. Unfortunately, once you're fully invested in the characters and in love with the scenery, the director abruptly pulls the rug out from under you. For the sake of brevity, I'm going to list the awkwardly resolved plot points that left me scratching my head:

*I found myself wondering if I had missed an episode, or at least some vital piece of the action, as love interest Robert Carne (David Morrisey) and his horse abruptly plunge off a cliff. One minute he's enjoying the bracing Yorkshire rain, the next we're told his horse has been found on the beach below. Are we to assume he's dead, or hope he's alive? Apparently the former: there's a sudden funeral. His body must have washed up at some point (I can't be sure - all we see is a dark shape bobbing in the waves as children play on the beach), but the sequence of events at this point is so confused it's hard to work out what's actually happened. When the action turned abruptly from the graveside ceremony to Carne riding breathlessly along the cliffs, I thought for a moment he was crashing the funeral to exclaim ""that body isn't mine!"". It turned out to be an awkwardly inserted flashback, complete with dodgy CGI, to explain how he'd died (mudslide).

*Ms Burton (Anna Maxwell Martin) announces at the funeral that she knew Carne well, and was not ashamed to say it. The problem is, she didn't know him well. She helped him deliver a calf, and they had a single date (followed by a late-night tryst that ultimately didn't pan out, due to a mysterious heart condition that is never adequately explained). The chemistry between the two is palpable, but the relationship isn't explored in enough depth to make Carne's death truly devastating. The romance began pretty abruptly (something along the lines of ""would you like to come to my room?""), and the only reason it wasn't a shock was because we've all seen tv shows before, and we all know the main guy usually hooks up with the main girl. It could have been handled with more grace, but I guess delivering a calf with someone is the sort of icky/lovely bonding experience that rapidly accelerates the relationship to Stage Two, whether you like it or not.

*Socialist Joe Astell's declaration of love for Ms Burton comes completely out of the blue, and lacks resonance. I was never quite sure what he was doing in the story, or what his relationship to Ms Burton was, but in the final episode she emphatically declares that they are ""just friends"", then emphatically kisses him. Then the mudslide, then Astell's proposal (of sorts), which is confusing and ill-timed, as though the director is trying to tie up loose ends we didn't even know were there.

*After her father's death, Carne's daughter Midge, whom the first and second episodes imply is prone to psychosis and cruelty, inexplicably decides to live with her grandfather, whom neither Midge nor the audience has ever met until the last five minutes of the program. This, despite her father asking the beloved and familiar Mrs Beddows to raise Midge in the event of his death.

*Carne's mentally ill wife, who is usually doped up and restrained when he visits her in the asylum, is suddenly released after his death and returns home to Midge and the grandfather. Throughout the marriage she was suicidal and promiscuous, and Carne announces shortly before he dies that it doesn't looks like she will ever be well enough to leave the asylum. So what's the deal? Is she recovered? Was it a madwoman-in-the-attic type scenario, the psychologically unbalanced wife imprisoned by a husband who is himself no angel, or is she genuinely in need of full time care? The story never lets us in on her diagnosis, but I'm not confident that she's fit to raise a daughter, and we don't even witness the reunion. It's unsatisfying. Moreover, Ms Burton seems to have formed no lasting bond with Midge despite claiming to 'know' her father, and it's unclear why Midge is so indifferent about Mrs Beddows.

*Lydia Holly returns to school and becomes a teacher, which is as it should be. The circumstances are bizarre, though. After the sudden death of his wife (presumably due to a botched abortion?), her father decides, apparently on the spur of the moment, to propose marriage to a decent-looking woman we've never met before. Why she accepts the offer of a destitute widower with four or five kids - including an infant - and living in what can only be described as a converted tram is not clear, but it does wrap everything up in a neat little package, which I guess was the point.

*Married councillor Alfred Huggins' relationship with Bessy Warbuckle is disturbing, in that I can't tell whether she's supposed to be intellectually challenged or not. She's sophisticated enough to seduce Huggins, but blithely announces her pregnancy as though he'll receive it as happy news. Either way, once her scheming fiancee has extorted a large sum from Huggins, she seems to vanish from the story. Huggins gets his comeuppance in the form of a major financial loss, but it's not clear why the eccentric and corrupt Alderman Snaith gets away with his machinations, or really what he has to do with the story at all, except as a plot device. I may have actually missed something there, because I don't totally get what happened in the end.

Ultimately, the various storylines converge in a tangled mess in the third and final episode, and resolve themselves unsatisfactorily or not at all. Everything winds up very suddenly, and it left me puzzled and frustrated. It wasn't the story of triumph over struggle and poverty that I had hoped it would be. I didn't necessarily anticipate a happy ending, but an audience is always entitled to a satisfying one, because we've engaged with the characters and invested in the story. Sarah Burton's motivations remained a mystery, and her militant feminism and defiant attitude too often came across as unprovoked irritability. Though she succeeds in drawing promising student Lydia Holly back to school, she fails to engage with her on her level, or to present realistic solutions to the problems of a critically impoverished single-parent family. While Lydia triumphs, fellow student Midge Carne is abandoned to an indifferent fate.

Despite it's visual beauty and glossy production values, the meaning of this story is obscured in a confused conclusion, and I'm disappointed.",1318464000,23,7707,4.966666666666667

The class distinctions that were peculiar to England especially in the thirties after the First World War play a big part in this story. The girls are from very different back grounds. Some from extreme poverty and some from the peerage which does seem somewhat unlikely , but interesting.
Sarah also has suitors that add to the romantic in all of us  .The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the depiction of a Methodist minister who is totally corrupt, also unrealistic . Why do authors always pick on ministers to be bad guys ?
