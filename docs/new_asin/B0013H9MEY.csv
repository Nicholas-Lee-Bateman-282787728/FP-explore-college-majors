8250955,5,B0013H9MEY,Very interesting movie. Glad I bought it. A real different world those people live in. Not certain I could survive in such a lifestyle but was really an eye opener to that dream factory they call L.A.,1458604800,,200,4.4324324324324325
8250956,4,B0013H9MEY,"I am disappointed in the price.  I taped it back in the 90's when it was on tv and wanted to update to dvd.
It is an excellent movie.  Paul Winfield, CC Pounder, and Neal McDonough are the leaders of a very good.cast.
I was hoping for a sequel for  many years after it aired.
Not only is there no sequel, but the cost of this one is prohibitive.",1410739200,,345,3.971014492753623
8250957,5,B0013H9MEY,Saw only part of this when it originally broadcast.  Just ordered from Sasquatch video for $21.94 including shipping.  I've been looking for a DVD at a decent cost for years.  Can't wait to watch it.  The storyline is fascinating.,1382745600,10,230,4.82051282051282
8250958,5,B0013H9MEY,"I absolutely loved this movie.  I remember it from when I was growing up.  I totally agree with the previous comments. My favorite part of this movie is definitely the epic wardrobe.  Considering when it was released and that is was meant for TV, the graphics are also very nicely done.  The price is absolutely insane. Try going to Times Forgotten DVD online. It is actually a reasonable price there. :o)",1377648000,,405,4.661971830985915
8250959,5,B0013H9MEY,"Debz Vidz wants $125.90 + 2.99 for a movie that can be ordered online for $17.99 - I guess I'm not allowed to say here the name of the site, but you can find it easily. Don't pay an insane price for a dvd (or sales tax either)",1363132800,2,226,3.7291666666666665
8250960,4,B0013H9MEY,I really enjoyed this movie when it aired on the Sci-fi channel. I have found dvds for only $17.99.  This guy who is selling this here is ridiculously way too overpriced.,1244332800,11,170,4.483870967741935
8250961,5,B0013H9MEY,"I really liked this movie when I saw it ages ago and would really like to get a copy on DVD. However, I can not imagine a reason for the price this seller is asking, even if they have the only DVD copy available, even if it were autographed by the entire cast and crew, I still would not pay $130. Even though I really liked the movie I would rather never see it again than pay that much.",1242777600,6,388,3.9240506329113924
8250962,5,B0013H9MEY,"White Dwarf is a great movie, but NO movie is worth this asking price. I just bought a copy on Ebay for less than $20. If you're a fan of this movie, but don't want to pay 6 times a regular DVD price, check Ebay... the seller had 4 copies... now 3.",1234396800,,248,3.7884615384615383
8250963,5,B0013H9MEY,"I would have loved to own this on DVD, however the price is to silly for a DVD, damn its not gold you know.",1213574400,,107,3.5
8250964,5,B0013H9MEY,"I was disappointed to see the price of this DVD when I looked for it.  I copied the movie from a TV presentation a long time ago (80's?)and wanted to replace my poor quality VHS with a DVD.  Guess I've got a collectible.  The storyline is unique about a society on a star far from earth where there is either all light or all dark all of the time.  The characters are colorful and not run of the mill good or bad.  They include a cynical materialistic young doctor from New York come to serve an internship on the White Dwarf; a seasoned doctor who can kill with his voice; a teen shape-shifter abandoned by his mother; a beautiful princess who must unite the light and dark sides; a beautiful and sad lady who is doomed to live forever; as well as various kindly but repulsive creatures (no copies from another movie). The acting is good and while set in the far distant future galaxies away, the costumes and music are early 1900's earth-style.  I really love this movie and will patiently await the time when I can afford $125.",1207785600,14,1030,4.394736842105263
