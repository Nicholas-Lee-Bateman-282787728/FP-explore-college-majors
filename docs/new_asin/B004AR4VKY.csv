8420655,4,B004AR4VKY,"Narrated by Michael Murphy, this AMERICAN EXPERIENCE episode profiles the three year Greely Expedition, headed by Lt. Adolphus Greely. It was an ill-conceived US Army Signal Corp project manned mostly by cavalry privates with no harsh weather or seagoing experience. Their eastern Canadian mission had two public goals: to establish a meterological Arctic base, and to take polar and astronomical observations, and a private aim: to travel further north than the British had in the 17th Century.

Two men managed to beat that British mark by 4 miles, and scientific data was indeed gathered and carefully recorded. Everything else, unfortunately was a botch.

After the first winter, and with a resupply ship unable to reach them,  Lt. Greely made the decision to head south in three small open boats toward a Greenland rendevous point. Miraculously, all 26 safely reached Ft. Conger, a warm and sturdily-built outpost surrounded by wild caribou and musk ox that could've sustained them for years, if necessary.

Believing he was obeying orders, the lieutenant made the expedition abandon this refuge and push further south over some of the most treacherous waters on Earth, a trip that reduced him to the edge of a nervous breakdown. He believed a rescue ship was waiting, but there was none. Unknown to Greely, two missions had already failed.  One of the ships was crushed by ice and sunk. Thus, the rescuers needed rescuing themselves.

Too far south to dare making their way back up to Ft. Conger, the expedition was forced to winter in the open. They endured terrible weather and little food. As everyone weakened, the dead were left unburied, for no one had the strength to hack through ice to make shallow graves. In these darkest perpetual nights of 1883-84, corpses were cannibalized.

That any survived is a miracle brought about only by the tireless efforts of Greely's wife, who never abandoned hope. She used newspaper publicity to shame the government into dispatching yet another rescue mission, an effort that succeeded in June '84. By then, only seven remained barely alive. One man died aboardship, and the other half-dozen were transported back to the U.S.

To the end of his long life, Lt. Greely never complained of being abandoned in the frigid Arctic. (NOT IN THE DOCUMENTARY:) Over time he rose in rank to brigadier general and was appointed Signal Corp Chief by Grover Cleveland. Greely, now a Maj. General, was military commander during the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake recovery. He retired two years later at age 64, and lived to be 91.",1334361600,2,2565,5.0188235294117645
8420656,3,B004AR4VKY,"If you liked DVDs on the Endurance, Shackleton's tragedy in Antarctica, or PBS' ""Arctic Passage,"" then you will like this.  For those unfamiliar with those sad tales, if you liked Cameron's ""Titanic,"" this may appeal to you.  Basically, if you want to explore how voyages fail and how sadly life is lost, then this will fascinate you.

This also points to being screwed over by the powers that be (like the Company vs. Ellen Ripley).  The US military sent these men on a mission to the Arctic, but didn't give them a ship, promising to pick them up the next year.  One ship did try to pick them up, but when it abandoned that mission, no replacement followed up on the promise.  Later, the military blamed the men when it was exposed for its renege.

This made me think of ""Mutiny on the Bounty,"" however, mutiny was avoided here.  In fact, Mr. Greely was a dynamic character.  He lost the trust of his men, but then gained it back.  The facts here have ""He's not heavy; he's my brother"" themes to it.  Some of the men saved a frostbitten comrade, rather than carry meat left by the British that would have fed others.  Another man did the same.

Unsurprisingly, the crew was male, but there are interests to women as well.  One of the interviewed scholars was a woman.  The men were saved because Greely's wife exposed the military's cowardice to the press.  Perhaps this work is an example of strong love between two spouses.  This is the first time I've heard of white explorers traveling to the Arctic but having no contact with the Inuit people.

Just as I was about to say that ""This disaster was nothing like the Donner Party,"" the work concludes by revealing that the men tried to hide their cannibalism.  The work suggests they garnered no sympathy, but hey!, desperate times call for desperate measures.

There is a bit of a silver lining here.  Unlike Shackleton's crew that did not beat the Norwegians to the South Pole, Greely's crew did beat the Brits' record going North at the time.  An interviewee stated that the numbers Greely recorded can help us to measure the extent of global warming.",1308268800,3,2107,4.592493297587131
