1881261,4,B000099635,"This is a great DVD for a fan of the Matrix or for introducing someone to anime. If you're a fan of the Matrix, it answers some of the unanswered questions from the movies. ""We don't know who struck first, us or them. But we do know it was us that scorched the sky."" Thanks to ""Second Renaissance,"" now we know who struck first and more.
If you want to introduce someone to anime, this is also good because of the diversity in this DVD. Each segment shows a differant aspect of what anime has to offer. It's like a really nice sampler platter to help whet the appetite.
There's only reason I didn't give five stars. Some segments were way too compact for the amount of story they were trying to cram in.  To be fair, there's only so much story you can cram into a 9-16 minute frame of time. That these writers/directors were able to do as much with their segments as they did is a real testiment to their skill.
A word on the sound track, it's definetely worth the extra bit of cash. With 12 tracks including ""Meat Beat Manifesto"" and ""Juno Reactor,"" it's a great listen to.",1054771200,,1074,4.29064039408867
1881262,5,B000099635,"Alrighty, this will be a bit different from my usual reviews. Animatrix is done as an omnibus, so therefore, I shall give my opinion of each segment on its own.
1. Final Flight of the Osiris: Top notch computer animation and a story that leads straight into the second movie. This one is more eye-candy than anything else, but it's good eye-candy.
2. The Second Renaisance Pts. 1 & 2: The history of our future, as told by the archives of Zion. Learn the chilling origin of the Matrix, and learn that the machines aren't the only ones to blame for the downfall of humanity. Chilling and graphic imagery, with direct parallels to well known historical events. This gives us an expanded view of what Morpheus told Neo in the first movie. Not for the squeamish.
3. Kid's Story: Utilizing bizarre imagery, this is the tale of one young man who became aware of the Matrix, and his efforts to escape. Symbolism is thick, and there are thoughts on modern youth culture in this world.
4. Program: All cel animation, but you would never know from looking at it. Two lovers quarrel over returning to the Matrix as they fight in a gorgeous rendition of old Japan. This one will leave an indelible mark on the viewer. The keen ear will detect superb voice acting from Samuri Jack's title actor, Phil LaMarr.
5. World Record: This one is wholly symbollic of man's eternal struggle, not against machine, though the Matrix is certainly involved, but rather, against his own human limitations. A tribute to the indomitable spirit of humanity. This tale is about a track runner trying hard to push the limits of his mind and body...and paying a heavy price for doing so.
6. Beyond: A glitch...or a haunted house. Either way, a group of children discover a place of magic in the world. But the Agents have discovered it, as well. Ever wonder why there is no magic left in the world? This story will offer you one possible reason.
7. A Detective Story: Harken back to the days of Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe in this film noir homage. Detective Ash is hired to find Trinity, but his search through the looking glass and down the rabbit hole will not be an easy one. The art here reflects the true beauty of old black and white films.
8. Matriculated: What if the problem is that humans and machines never really tried to understand one another? What if neither understood the others suffering? Is it possible to reach out and offer an olive branch for peace? Or have the machines learned too well the art of cruelty from their former masters? This one features the familiar art style of Peter Chung, of Aeon Flux and Reign: The Conqueror fame. Also voice acting by Dwight Schultz from Star Trek: The Next Generation.
Enthusiasts of voice acting will recognize several voices, including Tara Strong, notably of the Powerpuff Girls, Kevin Richardson, who, ironically enough, played Morpheus in a Matrix parody done by Kevin Smith in his Clerks animated series, and the voices of Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Matt McKenzie of the original movie.
The soundtrack disc included is also of good quality, featuring a number of innovative techno style songs, most notably the track ""Who Am I?"" from the Kid's Story segment.
The only pity is that we will never get an anthology like this for television, because there is so much of the Matrix that could be delved into.
P.S. There is no spoon.",1054771200,5,3372,4.66890756302521
1881263,5,B000099635,"I knew buying this that with 9 short films there had to be a couple ones that weren't great. I was shocked to see each film is beyond the level of fantastic. I can't believe how good ALL these films were. Any fan of The Matrix, CGI, or Anime, will love this. In fact, I think anyone who likes movies in general will find all these films to be great.",1054771200,,349,4.0
1881264,2,B000099635,"I am a huge Matrix fan, but I was disappointed with Animatrix.  I went out and bought it the first day because I thought it would be great.  My friends and I watched it together and were not impressed.  Kid Story and Detective Story are the only two I really liked.  Kid Story tells the story of the kid in Reloaded that is obsessed with Neo, so it is good to know the story behind him.  Also, many of the stories tell a lot of the background info of Matrix, which is interesting.  This video is something all Matrix fans should see, but don't buy it.  You probably won't want to see it more than once or twice.",1054771200,2,611,4.127118644067797
1881265,4,B000099635,"Hooboy, I can't say much at the moment other than that it kicked ... I went ahead and picked up the slightly more expensive gift set, which comes packaged with a soundtrack CD (Which I'll get to in a moment), and oh, it was worth the [money]. I'll spare you a detailed summary of events and instead deliver a few personal comments. Keep in mind, though, I haven't been able to sift through the entire thing as of yet.
First of all, let me be clear about this - there are a few shorts I simply did not like enough to view a second time I've already seen. Second Renaissance via the web release, and while interesting, they don't demand a second look like some of the others; Matriculated alienated me with its funked up animation, but did something to bridge the gap with an interesting story; meanwhile, Program's dialogue made my cry and the animation simply laughed at me while the story delivered blows to my face.
So you may be thinking, ""What? So now we're looking at 5 animated shorts... are they really worth it?"" The answer, of course, is yes, by all means yes, forever yes! Perhaps that level of enthusiasm isn't warranted, but I simply really dug this collection. Onto the ones I liked in ascending order...
Oh, hey, be warned of some possible spoilers. I don't plan on revealing raw facts, but some obvious conclusions can be drawn from what I write, so if you haven't already been spoiled, be wary, or try to contract a case or short-term memory loss. Either should suffice, although the comedic opportunities accompanying the latter make for a more hilarious situation.
Detective Story: Gritty animation, grim story. As stylistic as it was, the animation eventually started to wear on my eyes, but the story held me to a reluctant and fitting end. Didn't entice me too much, but I liked it enough.
World Record: Interesting animation develops into curious animation (d)evolves into disturbing and messed up animation as a track star goes all-out to break records and, consequentially, himself. I liked the dub, and as weird as the character designs were, I found myself attracted to them by the end of the segment. Worth a good few views.
Final Flight of the Osiris: I can hear the people screaming at me for not placing this one at the top, but luckily I do not care what they think. This is one of the more visually appealing segments of the DVD; in fact, I may be shortchanging it, as in places it's simply unbelievably cool and realistic. Graphically, Square has come quite a long way from The Sprits Within, but unfortunately the dialogue is as terse and flat as ever. While the dub doesn't approach the level of flat-out mind-numbing burning OH GOD THE FIRE BURNING BURNING pain that is Program, it still lacks much. Nice overall, though, and definitely worth more than a couple viewings.
Beyond: Personally, I find this to be the most interesting of all of the shorts. The concept is original (and actually ties in at a small level with the Oracle's explanation of the supernatural in Reloaded), the animation is lovely, I dug the characters (for such a short story, they were developed surprisingly well), and I want to keep watching it because it's relatively inspiring. There is little actual action, but the premise upon which the story is based leads me to think that an entire animated series could be based off of this, because it's so open-ended and appealing. Overall, I give it ""Boogie Supreme,"" but I don't know exactly what that is. I'm sure it's something good, though.
Kid's Story: It ties into the Matrix! Yeah, so do the others, but I found this one to be the most attention-grabbing, and the relationship between Reloaded and this segment is very, very clear, if inconsequential. Probably the most badass of all of the shorts, there's an extended skateboard chase (believe me, it's exponentially better than the two-word description may have you thinking), and the animation style is brilliant. Same director as Detective Story, Shinichiro Watanabe, but the animation is completely different. Produced as rough-edged sketches, the images and especially the fluid animation of Kid's Story really grabbed me. It's also got the closest thing to an action scene from The Matrix as exists on this disc (so I say, others may disagree), and overall I'd say it is my favorite. Also note that Keanu Reeves supplies the voice of Neo in this segment, and the annoying kid (""Kid""?) from Reloaded is here, voice and animated representation intact. Imagine that, being picked to not only star in Reloaded but also have your likeness injected into a indisputably badass animated short. Full-star groove.
And the soundtrack CD! I love this thing. I dig 3/4 of this cd, and as cheap as it was, it's a great deal. The last three songs (Juno Reactor and two no-name electronic bands - sorry to offend the one or two followers of either of them) grow repetitive quickly, and the last two are unfortunately laced with blatantly annoying samples from The Matrix. The first 9, though, I love. Completely and totally. It's worth the few extra dollars for the gift set, believe me.",1054684800,,5093,4.762443438914027
1881266,4,B000099635,"Animatrix is a must for any true fan of the Matrix. I purchased the Animatrix because I wanted to know the the backround behind the series. And it delivered beyond what I expected. The art work and CG animation is some of the best I've seen to date. If you've read some of the other reviews you probably noticed that violence comes up more than once in the reviews.  NO KIDDIN'! This is not for children. Although The violence in the film is used to make a point, it is also down right disturbing.",1054598400,,497,4.287234042553192
1881267,5,B000099635,"This was the most brilliantly interpeted, scripted and thought provoking thing I have seen in a very long time.  The DVD gives you background filler for what the Matrix is and the Wachowski brothers allow some of Japan's best anime artists to interpet the 9 different stories on their own.  I think, just like art, each viewer will have a different type of experience.  You have 9 wonderful compelling stories and the visual style is so different that it adds much value to the telling of the stories.  The brothers had a vision and clearly the Matrix effected many people and, what a wonderful gift they gave by incorporating the world of anime into the telling of their vision.  But not only is it visually stunning and stylish, but the music is dead on.  There are all sorts of morals in the stories.  From SECOND RENNAISSANCE'S man's destructive nature and his down fall, to the sort of, don't-play-with-fire nature of MATRICULATED and the playfulness and joy of BEYOND.  Plus the DVD special features take us into each director of each piece explaining his ""art"" and how the film the Matrix effected them.  We even get a little history on the orgins of anime.  It was just really enjoyable to watch people who are so passionate about their craft and about the Matrix.  I think you will enjoy this immensly and take something out of it yourself.",1054598400,,1349,4.673728813559322

1881274,5,B000099635,"I'm surprised to read reviews that marginalize the commentary.

Why?

The commentary says the Matrix and the Wachowski brothers' work is essentially inspired by the Japanese animation style.  Not just in visual perspectives, but Japanese animation and other media has long had an apocalyptic thread of reference (tied to the history of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings, of course).  So for a series of anime shorts to be then based on the Matrix, things come full circle.

It also says some writers chose to write their interpretations purely from scratch, rather than use existing references the brothers provided.  So I think it's easier to view these episodes as side stories more or less exploring the concept of the Matrix, although a few had specific references and connections to the main story.  It's slightly comparable to fan fiction, but with much more structure, and full official support, although I think that's a relatively crude and incomplete analogy, now that I think of it.

I mean, c'mon, those that visited [...] when the promo website FIRST started-- weren't you thinking of the conceptual possibilities of the Matrix then?

I think the brothers stumbled a bit with Reloaded and Revolutions, and I seem to recall other fans were similarly disappointed.  Again, as The Animatrix is not fully bound by the main story, I think that makes it a gem, and worth keeping in a collection even if you don't collect the other two movies.  It's certainly not a piece that is not much more than promotional fluff (as others pointed out with other animated tie-ins to other movies). It more or less stands well on its own.  You could view this before the first movie and I don't think it'd necessarily spoil things.

Oh, and I'm one of those movie soundtrack nuts, so I did buy this packaged with the CD soundtrack and enjoyed it as well.  I think it related much better to The Matrix movie, actually (as it did have voice samples from the movie) but then it didn't have commercial artists singing songs that weren't necessarily written with the movie in mind (which is fairly typical of studio movie soundtracks, including The Matrix).",1337904000,3,2147,4.878787878787879

You all liked the Animatrix the first time around, but you'd be surprised how rewarding it is to watch it again and see everything again in a fresh light.

1881280,5,B000099635,"This dvd comes with a musical cd which is great now about this dvd. The U.S. people went to Japan to have them draw the cartoons of nine short movies that involes the Martix movies each with different stories. The americans wrote the stories. To tell what I think about each story look down below.

FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS (8/10)-This one is the only one in 3D graphics I say it looks pretty good, I love it when while they were inside the ship shooting at the machines that were outside just like in the ""Matrix Revolutions"", the dissapointing thing was at the end they all died anyway.

SECOND RENAISSANCE PART 1 & 2 (10/10)-This one is the best of all of them. I wish it was a movie of it's own making it to the big screen. The drawings were 100% perfect especially on how the United Nation building was drawn. Both 1 & 2 is telling you on how it all started when man invented machines to do work for them then on machine was the first to kill his master then all the humans were distorying the machines then the machine created a city for themselves to get back at humanity.

KID'S STORY (7/10)-The animation was very good at first until the agents arived at this boys high school and started chasing him at his school he was running on his skate board thats when the picture started to look so blury and way out of drawn right which ruined it for me. This boy was a lost soul to commit suicide.

PROGRAM (5/10)-For me it was ""ok"". I liked the fighting in the forest when that man and woman were knights to me those were good moves, the animation was a bit bad it looked like that anime show ""Regin"". The story was a bit entertaining when this man wanted this woman to come with him to leave the matrix she refuses then kills him, then she wakes up learns that it was all a test and she pass but she didn't took it too well.

WORLD RECORD (4/10)-World Record was the worstest onw I hated out of the most. All it had was a man who was not suppose to race on his legs or else he could gets paralise for good he didn't listen when his legs started to break the whole picture started to look so stupid and weird it usually had nothing to do with the matrix movies. I always fast foward through this one movie what a waste. Also very bad animation.

BEYOND (5.5/10)-It was just 50/50 for me. I could have been better. Just some girl who loses her cat she goes off to fine it in the ally with a bunch of kids playing and for some reason either they have magic powers or were they was at gravity is not a law I didn't get.

A DETECTIVE STORY (6/10)-I feel the same way about this one. Some detective is going after a computer hacker. It starts to get interesting when he meets Trinity on the train then the agents started shooting at her and him was my favorite part. Trinity her animated version looked very good in this movie.

MATRICULATED (6/10)-Don't know much to say about the last movie except it was alright. They were turing machines programing them to be on their side for a change. In the end all of the people died from fighting the evil machines, the only left alive was one machine which looked heart broken seeing that woman died.",1120608000,,3145,4.247491638795987
1881281,4,B000099635,"The Animatrix is a perfect crossover between American action and the greatest Japanese animation. There are 9 different stories, some written by the brothers themselves, others by artist from around the world who also used their own style of drawing, which makes it look a little uneven. It does however sets a perfect setting. A detective story for example evokes the time of the thirties and old newspapers. The last story is more comic book style, not so much animation.
For those interested in the mythology of the Matrix, this movie will provide more insight in how the Matrix works and how it came into existence, we finally are shown the events that lead to machines taking over. It reminded me a little of the Terminator movies.
It may also be a good introduction into Japanese animation, which is not like Disney, but far more artful.
This animation is a perfect addition for Matrix fans AND Japanese Animation fans",1086912000,,924,4.817610062893082
1881282,4,B000099635,"The Matrix had a lot of firsts in it. The first movie to use bullet time, the first movie to bring comic book and anime storytelling to live action, etc. On it's own The Matrix is a landmark film and had the Wachowski brothers left it at that, it would have been enough. Little did we know in 1999 (the year the Matrix was released) that the brothers had much more in store for us.
While doing a press junket in Japan, the Wachowski brothers took the opportunity to meet some of the directors of their favorite anime series and movies. On the plane ride back they hatched the idea that they would go beyond just the next two films that were planned to finish the trilogy. They decided to include anime and video games as additional mediums to tell their story. To my knowledge, no director has ever done this and this marks yet another first in the history of film.
The Animatrix is a collection of short stories all told through animation. Most of the directors come from Japanese animation, or anime as it is typically called. For many viewers, this was their first introduction to anime. Titles such as Cowboy BeBop, Ghost In The Shell and Blue Submarine No. 6 may be completely foreign to most American audiences, but with the Animatrix, they were being introduced to some of the best anime directors in the world.
Of the 9 segments contained in the Animatrix, only 4 of them were actually written by the Wachowski brothers. The other six were written by the Directors themselves. That being said, the Brothers did produce all of the segments to ensure that they other writers stayed true to the mythos of The Matrix. What the Wachowski brothers didn't do however was direct any of the segments. They actually turned over the reigns to the anime directors themselves. Not many directors would have been this collaborative, but it just goes to show what huge fans of anime the two brothers are.
Now you might be thinking, ""Well, this is just a cartoon, so what does it really matter?"" Given the fact that they didn't direct them and only wrote 4 of the 9 segments, the Animatrix, it might appear that this is just some marketing ploy, or some fanciful project that doesn't relate to The Matrix Trilogy at all. That is not the case. The Animatrix contains stories that not only relate to the Matrix, but actually include story arcs that tie directly into the movies.
Besides the 9 segments themselves, the DVD is jam packed with bonus materials. There are director commentaries for 4 segments as well as a history of Anime and a ""making-of"" documentary as well. If you like bonus materials on a DVD, you won't be disappointed in this one. There is also a package that includes a soundtrack to the Animatrix as well. The soundtrack is very good an includes some great techno music.
All in all, if you're a fan of the Matrix, then this is a must have in your collection. Even if you're not a huge fan of the Matrix it's still worth a watch. The fact that the story for the Matrix Saga weaves excellently through the Animatrix, you don't know the whole story if you haven't seen this DVD. There are references to it in both The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. You're enjoyment of the movies will be that much more heightened as a result of it.",1077840000,3,3254,4.5451448040885865
1881283,5,B000099635,"I purchased the Animatrix fairly recently. I have to say, this is good stuff. Others might say the stories are weak believe me, they are not, in fact, they make a lot of sense and are very clever ideas especially on The Second Renaissance 1&2. It explains everything The Matrix left you hanging on. It goes deeper than reloaded could have and I will not comment on Revolutions not having seen it yet. If you did enjoy Reloaded and if you've seen and enjoyed Revolutions, you should enjoy this",1071619200,,492,4.53932584269663
1881284,4,B000099635,"Nine short films that explain and digs in The Matrix Mythology. Six of them are outstanding (Final Flight of the Osiris, The second Renaissance Part I and II, Kid's Story, Program, and Beyond), one that is good (World Record), but not matching the storyline level of the best Animatrix, and two, that even though in their beautiful visuals, never achieves more beyond that (A Detectives Story, and Matriculated). I recommended to look at then as a whole, a full-length film divided in nine episodes, this because they are really part of single stage proposal, their goal is to make complete the whole picture, and so they do with a great effect. Fans of Japanimation will find it as a real piece of art, (visually it is, the quality and diversity of the animation is a strong element to take into consideration, always with the highly appealing Anime style), the ones that don't know the genre will find it breathtaking and refreshing, a real compelling view of The Matrix world and logic, here to make the Trilogy more accessible but maintaining its complex architecture of science fiction style.
The Wachowski Brothers enlisted an arsenal of first class Japanimation directors, and one from the computer animation world to bring to screen their innovative idea. Some of them where the main influence for The Matrix development, so in this cases, it became almost a matter of retribution, or an imposed tribute to then selves.
Final Flight of the Osiris (the first short in the package), made entirely of computer animation, is a prelude to The Matrix Reloaded. How the Osiris encounters the Sentinel Army and the communication of this to Zion, is the story. It can't be view along from the Trilogy because its intention is to illustrated (not tell), how humans spotted the invasion, plus it shows a quite sensual duel between its main characters before the tragedy (directed by Animation director of Final Fantasy, the Spirits Within, Andy Jones). Fast, accurate and captivating, a quick and sharp ride. The Second Renaissance Part I and II, shockingly narrates the facts of how the machines came to be the human predators. With a smart straight documentary style, the story captivates the scary sense of the first Matrix, more solid this time, the best of the Animatrix. Kid's Story, makes clear all about that none sense character appearing from no where in Reloaded, the graphic rough style is very much in the mood of this simple but emotional story, another piece that explains some facts of Reloaded. Program (written and directed by Ninja Scroll director), manipulates a computer training program that teaches a lesson to one of its users, but the lesson is all about possible betrayal disguised in a couple's love, the lesson is hard to learn, shocking and sharp. Beyond, the most poetic and beautiful of the Animatrix (a real pain in the a... for the producers because of its director slow making), tells the original story of a bunch of kids that encounters a fluctuation in the Matrix, shaped in the form of a haunted house, is a delicate view in this cold artificial world, like a rose in a pond. This six shorts are captivating with a imaginative view and narration that quickly takes you directly into their stories, an achievement very difficult to obtain in short films, sum to this the great musical work from Don Davis (redeeming himself from his mediocre work in The Matrix), rising the emotional twists and still moments. World Record is a good effort, but the story is not clearly explained, making it a little confusing in its resolution, so the goal of the runner is missed in the way for glory, somewhere in the script. A Detective Story (as the rest of the Animatrix), surprises with its animation, but the story is both boring (specially when comparison it with the previous seven shorts), and flat, do your business in the bathroom while this short is on, it is something like a Black Detective story, but without the charm of the genre it tries to emulate. Finally Matriculated is by far, the worst, annoying and pointless it tells an Alice in Wonder Land plot, only in abusing of it's own director work shipping of his animation, nothing more. The extras are more than interesting (specially, Scrolls to Screen; The History and Culture of Anime, a documentary), and the quality of the sound sure makes the experience worth buying or renting it, definitively a far better choice to have instead of Reloaded and Revolutions.",1070236800,2,4453,4.86824769433465

The CD was a different story.  If it were not for the CD in this set, I would have given this a five star rating.  If I were to do it all over again, I would have only purchased the DVD and skipped the CD.

1881288,4,B000099635,"I liked most of these stories if for nothing more than the artwork. I had my biggest problem with ""The Second Renaissance Parts I & II. I don't think we'd get that stupid and let machines come that far. The orginal robot should have been taken apart to find out what went wrong and then all other machines should have been updated accordingly. If I had my way I'd write ""The Second Renaissance Part III"". Ideally we'd get Joe Pantoliano to do the voice. I'd go something like this.
Fade in showing the machines digging. They find a bunker under ground. Inside is a skeleton of a long dead man and a recording device. The machines play the recording. (From the way the person is dressed in the recording and what's left of the skeleton, it's the same person.)
Recording beings. (The speaker is drinking what appears to be scotch and is getting ""looser"" as the speech goes on.)
(Speaker fills a glass)
Senator Reagan: This is Senator Reagan, if you are watching this recording now it probably means that those damn machines took over and the human race is being slaughtered wholesale. I tried to stop them I really did. When that first thing was put on trial I ranted against it. That right, I called it a thing. That's all it is. Those damn liberals think these over grown TV's and toaster ovens should have rights. I said no and tore three part on the senate floor had them rebuilt. They worked fine. Try doing that to a flesh and blood human. That only made me look like a bad guy. Well excuse me for defending the human race. It should have been taken apart to see how it developed a sense of self-preservation. Isaac Asimov anybody??? I, Robot??? Ring any bells???? No...
(Fills a glass again)
We destroyed most of them but not enough of them. They moved to the Middle East and set up ""01"" and we let these little trash compactors get away with it. We let them set up industries. Why??? No one saw it coming. They didn't ""pay"" their workers the way we did. Their workers didn't sleep, eat, unionize... That was the first and only time I asked, ""Where's the damn union when you need it??"" Labor activists should have been up in arms over this. But they weren't. I was stunned at the lack of outrage.
(Fills a glass, speech is slurring)
We nuked them. The EPM, blast wave and heat got some but not all of them. We stopped. Why??? People were too afraid to let their source for cheap goods dry up. They offered the olive branch, and then we decide to get tough on them. It was already too late for that. I personally put forth a banishment idea. Get those walking microwaves ovens off the planet. They could go to the Moon, Mars, leave the solar system all together. They could see if we are alone in the universe, but no.
We blackened the sky to stop them. I'd love to get my hands on the geniuses that thunk that one up. That's world government for ya.
(Fills the glass and downs it in one gulp)
Then things got really ugly, full-blown war. It started out looking like we might win this, but they were suckering us into a trap. They knew our weakness, their troops, if they can be call that didn't fear death. They can be put back together good as new. They unleashed plagues that made Ebola look like a skin rash. I even heard rumors that they stared using humans as a power source. That's rich, biometric energy it's called.
(Grabs the bottle and drinks straight from it, speech impaired)
It's getting very bleak now and I'm one of the lucky ones that got to hide were they would have a hard time finding me. If hiding makes me a coward so be it. I have no idea what's happening on the surface right now, but it's a good possibility that I could be the last ""free"" human on Earth. Funny, I'm free, but I'm trapped in a buried bunker. I only hope that humans are watching this and laughing their a$$es off at me, instead of those metal hunks of junk. If it is the machines, and I'm not a religious man, God have mercy on us all for what we have done and what we have failed to do.
(Throws the bottle against the wall, hear it shatter)

The recording ends.
Machines move on.
A little while later humans show up. They play the recording for themselves. Pull away from the site showing the humans watching the tape and the beginning of the audio starts again.",1059609600,2,4323,4.35811648079306
1881289,5,B000099635,"I have to admit that as much as I was anticipating the release of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" in the Spring of 2003, I was not particularly impressed with the effort. Sure, the special effects were terrific and (most of) the action sequences were amazing, but the movie eventually disappeared up its own @rse and drowned in a sea of metaphysical philosophical nospeak. It really didn't add much to the story as introduced in the original ""Matrix"" movie.
>
Which is why I find ""The Animatrix"" so much more rewarding and entertaining to watch. I was skeptical about the notion of an animated interpretation of ""The Matrix"" (what would be the point as beautifully presented as it was in live action?), but not only does ""The Animatrix"" expand dramatically on the themes of the first ""Matrix"" movie, this expansion also enables it to stand (to a large degree) independently of the first movie altogether.
>
""Final Flight of the Osiris"" starts the program; the graphics are amazing enough, but the true reason for this episode is to introduce the video game ""Enter The Matrix"" (and to show off the animation skills of its creators); it looks great, but it has little purpose.
>
""The Second Renaissance (Pts. I & II)"" does more to explain the cirumstances under which the characters in ""The Matrix"" movies have found themselves; extremely well-thought out and executed.
>
""Kid's Story"" is a bit of a Gen-X take on the ""awakening"" experience detailed in the first ""Matrix"" movie (guest appearances from Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in the English translations are a nice touch).
>
""Program"" is another variation on the training exercises within the virtual world; terrific animation from the folks who brought you ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust"" and ""Ninja Scroll"".
>
""World Record"" is dismissed by other reviewers, but I found it to be another interesting take on the ""awakening"" theme.
>
""Beyond"" was the first episode I'd seen from this collection; it is perhaps the most original interpretation of ""The Matrix"" themes to be found on this DVD (think back to Neo's ""deja vu"" experience from the first movie as a point-of-reference); many aspects of this story have ""other-worldly"" applications that weren't breached during either ""Matrix"" live-action movie...this one may have the most Japanese soul of all entries included here.
>
""A Detective Story"" is obviously (and brilliantly) done by the folks behind ""Cowboy Bebop""; very noir, very pulp fiction-esque, and another cameo appearance by Carrie-Anne Moss. Slickly done and my favorite episode to watch just for the sheer beauty of the production.
>
""Matriculated"" completes the collection, an hallucinogenic collection of images that begin wihtin the real world and pick up to a nearly lysergic rate with another training exercise session (although this one designed with the idea of ""converting"" enemy machines to the side of the human beings). My favorite anime artist, Peter Chung of ""Aeon Flux"" and ""Reign"" fame is the creative force behind this episode; like the other writers/directors/producers involved with this project, he makes the segment with which he's involved indelibly his own.
>
The soundtrack CD that accompanies the DVD in this set is also a worthy purchase; I'm no fan of electronica music, but the works included in ""The Animatrix"" are tastefully selected and rank high within the echelon of great anime' soundtracks. The songs are prominently mixed within the movie's audio mix (with the exception of ""Hands Around My Throat"" by Death In Vegas, my personal favorite track) and are recognizable at once when listened to after viewing the movie.  The bonus, non-soundtrack selections inspired from the first ""Matrix"" movie (and including dialogue samples from it as well) ""Red Pill, Blue Pill"" and ""The Real"" cap off a terrific listening experience.
>
If you watch the movie and enjoy it, a prominent aspect for your enjoyment will undoubtedly be the soundtrack; I knew after a single viewing that I had to own the DVD as well as its score CD, and I am absolutely satisfied with both.",1057190400,,4051,5.03725782414307

1. Final Flight Of The Osiris 10/10 STARS
A prequel to The Matrix Reloaded. Excellent CGI animation and sets up the movie well. One of the best films on the DVD, undoubtedly. FAVORITE SCENE: The sexy game of strip swordfight at the beginning.
2. The Second Renaissance Part I 10/10 STARS
While gory and violent, this movie is my personal favorite. This one is not for children. It explains the Genesis of The Matrix. Again with triumphant animation. FAVORITE SCENE: The robot mob's battle at Washington D.C.
3. The Second Renaissance Part II 10/10 STARS
This one focuses more on action. More of the same great animation and some really unique creations. FAVORITE SCENE: The robot horse riding out at the beginning of the war.
4. Kid's Story 9/10 STARS
The hand-drawn animation fits well here. This is the story of the kid in Reloaded that freed himself from the Matrix. FAVORITE SCENE: The skateboarding chase.
5. Beyond 9/10 STARS
Creepy animation. Strange story. FAVORITE SCENE: The falling contest between the two boys.
6. Program 10/10 STARS
Excellent fighting and animation. Equally good storyline. FAVORITE SCENE: The whole fighting sequence.
7. World Record 10/10 STARS
Possibly one of the best films on the DVD. Also gets an award for the Best Agent Design (ties with A Detective Story) FAVORITE SCENE: The end AKA 'Free Freeee'
8. A Detective Story 7/10 STARS
Good animation. Cheesy storyline. Good Agent Design. FAVORITE SCENE: ""For what it's worth, I think you could have handled the truth.""

1881293,5,B000099635,"In The Animatrix, the storyline of the Matrix trilogy is further expanded with 9 animated shorts by some of the best in the field.
Each of the short films helps to explain a part of the Matrix that was glossed over in the movies, helping to enrich our understanding of what was going on and where these characters came from.
A number of famous anime names were involved in this creation, including Shinchiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop), Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll), and Koji Morimoto (Robot Carnival). Because of this, each short has its own style, telling its own piece of the story in a unique way. This also means that some of the shorts are brilliant, but others are not quite as technically stellar.
An example of how the shorts fill in pieces can be seen with Final Flight of the Osiris, created by Square Pictures (the guys behind the Final Fantasy movie). In the movie The Matrix Reloaded, things begin with a mysterious package that ""Thadeus"" got to a post office, sacrificing his entire crew to do. Pretty much nothing else is said about that - the story focusses on what the package held. To help clarify this background, the game ""Enter the Matrix"" is all about how Niobe and Ghost managed to get to this package in the post office, and get it out to safety.
But Final Flight of the Osiris takes it one step further. It introduces us to Thadeus and his crew, and explains how they saw what they then felt was so important to tell others about. The only way they thought they could get the news to others was to put it in a package and drop the package into a mailbox - sending it to a secure post office box.
So a character and situation that maybe got one line in the movie now takes on a life of its own - helping to explain further both the movie and the game.
Matrix fans will love all of the extra information they're given by these shorts, and anime fans will love some of the gorgeous work shown by some of the best anime people around.
Yes, they're short. And yes, they're not related to each other. But each is a small work of art that helps show just how amazingly far we've come in anime - and gives a hint of what is yet to come.",1055894400,,2154,4.347394540942928
1881294,5,B000099635,"*No Spoilers*
To get started, movies I like are a little 'different' from your average Joe. I like DVD's like Fight Club, Se7en, Pulp Fiction, Who framed Roger Rabbit, Family Guy, and El Mariachi. I like anime as much as the next guy (Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Ninja Scroll), but I don't actually 'own' any of those yet. So why did I bother with this one?
Let's be honest, compilations rarely work, or if they do, they come out 'okay'. Take 'Four Rooms' for example, the first 'episode' [stinks], the second was alright, and the last two directed by Robert Rodriguez then Quentin Tarantino ROCKED. Looking at The Animatrix, reviews told me that it was either hit or miss as well. Well, I can tell you that this dvd is definitely a 'hit' and not the ladder. Looking at what reviewers said, its apparent that they think 'World Record' is the weakest of the nine. Well...no its not, in fact, my friends and I were pulled into its unique storyline and the way it was animated. All of these were unique and great in their own way, and if I had to pick favorates I'd have to say FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS, THE SECOND RENAISSANCE PARTS 1 AND 2, and KIDS STORY because of their tie ins with the trilogy as well as being particularly great, and DETECTIVE STORY and MATRICULATED (the Aeon Flux guy does a great job here, it's the last of the nine and is the longest and most 'out there').
I should also add that when I first saw RELOADED at the movie theater I didn't like it as the air conditioner was out and everyone just wanted to go home. I suggest giving it another shot, as I saw the movie at IMAX for a second viewing and I have to say it was great. You don't have to have liked any of the previous movies to appreciate The Animatrix, though.
For a final note, do what I did and get the two disk version of this movie. The soundtrack to this movie makes excellent background music for your room, computer, etc. Also despite what (ahem) some reviewers have said about you not being able to play all of the episodes at once, they are blind for not seeing the 'play all' feature at the bottom of the screen. No the credits do not play inbetween episodes, they all play at the end.
(I just want to say that this DVD looks cool playing on any TV in your house, no matter where its at.)
I hope this review was helpful, as I've seen a lot of...shall we say...unaccurate ones, so I hope this helps clear the fog.",1055808000,,2404,4.285714285714286
1881295,4,B000099635,"The animatrix was an interesting collection of animations styles, all set across the backdrop of the matrix. While I do admit that some of the sequences fell short of actually dealing with the matrix, or actually making much sense to begin with, (yes, I actually understood what was going on, but I mean making sense as having any relevance.) Two of the styles of animation were annoying (Kid's story and World Record.) If there had been more focus on the actual matrix world, instead of just taking place there, it might have been a smidgen better. All together it was an excellent collection of short anime features. (and the flight of the Osiris, which was an awesome CGI feature.) The best sequence dealt with the uprise of the machines against the humans, and how humanity basically screwed itself over. (The Second Renaissance I&II) I could tell where most of the plot was going before each segment was even 3 or 4 minutes in, so no surprise there. The wierdest segment would have to be matriculated, which was chock full of bizzaire and psychadelic images. All and all, a decent flick, especially if you area big fan of the matrix world. I was also amazed by the fact that in the english dub on the DVD, when Trinity and Neo speak, it is actually their respective actors that speak, instead of a dub over of someone else, which I was surprised by, it was interesting. I would rather watch it in japanese though, because it is, after all anime, and I prefer watching my anime in japanese, being as it is from japan (the Flight of the osiris was made by Square, the same guys who did final fantasy:spirits within, so I'm guessing it's japanese dub came first too, being japanese and all, but I could be wrong.)
The CD that came with this gift set was nice too, basically it is just a collection of the music from the film, so if you liked the music, or some electronica, (although this stuff isn't what I'm used to listening too, Im more of a hard trance/rave electronic music junkie) its pretty good.

1881296,4,B000099635,"As a big anime fan I was thrilled to find out that the Animatrix was going to be released. This collection of 9 animated shorts, for the most part, doesn't disappoint.
Final Flight of the Osiris: Square pictures deliveres, in stunning CG detail, an entertaining plot that leads right into Reloaded and the Enter the Matrix game. There's a sword fight simulation, a chase scene in the real world on board the Osiris and some delightful acrobatics done inside the matrix. The visuals look even better than FF: The Spirits Within. A-
The 2nd Renaissance Parts 1&2: This short does a great job at telling the history of mankind from the not-too-distant future to the time of the first Matrix movie. Graphic battle scenes ensue and there is imagery that parallels the Tieneman Square Rebellion and Vietnam war executions. You really feel that mankind has been wronged by the end. B+
Kid's Story: One of my two favorite shorts on the compilation, it tells the story of a lonely American high school student who discovers that the matix exists in a similar way to how Neo did in the first movie. The beautiful art style must be noted because it's one of the things that makes this short stand out. The sketchy effect gives the caracter's a great sense of motion and personality. A
Beyond: This short, which was over two years in the making, shows an anomele within the matrix. It's a ""haunted house"" to the local kids who stumble across the various outworldly characteristics that had been overlooked in the matrix's programming. The kid's take the this glitch to be a playhouse of sorts, but there bubble gets busted later. A-
World Record: A world class runner almost breaks out of the matrix by breaking the set limits the human body was programmed to be capable of. Some reviewers have put down the art style which is an ignorant remark. Without the distortions of the character models, this short would lose a great deal of it's appeal. The running animations work because they are a bit distorted. The ends lets one draw hi/her own conclusions as well. Overall, a cool supplement to the Matirx trilogy. B+
Program: A battle simulation with a feudal Japanese setting. Throughout the fight, one cahacter tries to convince the other that they should be reinserted into the matrix. This is a beautiful anime to watch and is one of the more traditional shorts in the compilation. The traditional Japanese elements like colors, costume design and settings are all done well. B+
Detective Story: This is my favorite short in the Animatrix. The hard-boiled film noir style is a fun concept that isn't seen much these days. The appearance every texture is given makes each still frame look as if it's fresh of a newspaper press. The story follows a detective, Mr. Ash, as he tracks down computer hacker Trinity. The story is great, but it really needs to be seen to be appreciated. A
Matriculated: From Peter Chang, this short brings up the possibility of the machines right to choose what side to be on as humans try to convince a captive drone to join the freedom fight. This is done through some very trippy visuals and colors. This is my least favorite short, the underlying concept is interesting but some of the things done inside the machines minds just seem pointless. Sometimes the CG and hand drawn animation doesn't fuse all that well in my opinion either. C+
On other aspect of the DVD that really shines is the bonus material. There are cohesive ""making-of"" supplements for each film and audio commentaries from the directors for four of the shorts. These give the viewer a greater appreciation for the works presented. There's also a nice little ""history of anime"" short that will do well to educate those not familiar with anime. Also it shows how much anime has been an influence on the Matrix trilogy.
Finally I must mention the great sountrack that plays throughout the shorts. There are great tracks from Layo&Bushwacka!, Juno Reactor, Massive Attack, Tech Itch, Junkie XL and more. Orchestrated scores are used on a few of the shorts and fit in nicely where a techno beat wouldn't feel appropriate.",1055030400,19,4108,4.771067415730337

In other words, all of the pieces penned by The Boys (Final Flight of the Osirus, Renn. Pt 1&2, and Kid's Story) are simply INTENSE breathtaking shorts.  I understood M2(Reloaded) a lot more the next time I saw it after watching ""Final Flight..."" and ""Kid's Story"".  After watching the first four shorts I felt as of I had been Clubbed to Death, so to speak.

HOWEVER, and much to my dismay, I don't think the other pieces are of the same caliber.  The weakest piece is ""The Program"" and is unfortunately placed IMHO (although there really is no other slot it would have fit in either) right after the Warchowski Quadruple Punch at the beginning.  The four of the final five pieces were a bit like reading mediocre fan fiction.  The last Short came the closest to actual comprehension of The Boys vision, *I* believe, but it has been dubbed confusing by many.
It is definitely one of the most philosphical pieces, and echos M2's bourgeoning message that the only way for either man or machine to survive, is to come to the reluctant realization that both Man and Machine need each other to survive.

Buy it if you are a COLLECTOR or a FAN(atic). Rent this if you are more casual about the Matrix-verse.  If you want another hour of side story featuring Niobe, buy the Enter the Matrix video game.

1881299,5,B000099635,"...""The Matrix: Reloaded"" and ""Enter the Matrix"" game combined. The animation was particularly good, especially for ""Matriculated"" (since Peter Cheung is one of my favorite producers/animators, etc.).  The storytelling resembles the original ""Matrix"" movie, in that it is not so canned and prepared.  Rather each of the shorts flesh out rather nicely in their own ways.  I will explain the few that I liked particularly.
Final Flight of the Osiris: This short was the prelude in ""Enter the Matrix"" game and the backstory to ""The Matrix: Reloaded.""  Excellent 3-D modeling and animation.  Basically the Osiris is destroyed after being pursued by the Sentinels and the package arrives in some post office.
Second Renaissance: Parts 1 & 2:  Explains how the Matrix was formed and the existence of coldless machines and their ""symbiotic"" relationships with humans. This anime contained very disturbing scenes of war, conflict and basically humanity at its worst.
Matriculated: This is an anime how humans are humanizing the very machines that are attempting to destroy them.  This describes the conflict whether machines are really tools at all or contain sentient existence (like cells in the human body).  Basically, machines undergo self-realisation in this anime.  (Side note on my part: Maybe Agent Smith and/or (some of the) the Machines will undergo such humanization in the final installment of the Matrix trilogy? Good question, eh?)
Overall, this DVD was really worth purchasing compared to ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" or the game.  At least it was much more entertaining.",1054857600,,1573,5.331983805668016

7990138,5,B000099635,"The Animatrix is better than the movies. A must see if you are a fan. I do love The Matrix and The Matrix: Reloaded. We all know Revolutions is meh. Too bad the Wachowski bro... I mean, sisters, have had a difficult the finding that level of success again. Cloud Atlas was great but I couldn't get halfway through Jupiter Ascending even though I like the two leads.",1478822400,,365,4.382352941176471
7990139,5,B000099635,"This film is great to own and the low price ($4 including shipping!) and the decent soundtrack, this is worth owning. Even if you aren't a fan of the Matrix films. The Animatrix is certainly better than the Matrix sequels.",1468627200,,222,4.575

7990142,5,B000099635,"I was never a fan of the Matrix trilogy (as the Nostalgia Critic says, there are more of us). But I adore animation and watched this set of short stories on an anime streaming site, then decided to purchase it because I liked it so much. Each story is a small piece of the Matrix world and it explains it beautifully.

I wish the Matrix had had more of this style of  storytelling. Even if you don't always understand what is going on (Matriculated) you do feel for and understand the characters.

I highly recommend this piece for all.",1438646400,,536,4.393939393939394

7990145,4,B000099635,"The 9 shorts were pretty good. Its not necessarily a must see, but its a nice backdrop to the trilogy. If anything, it brings hope that more spinoffs might be coming down the road in the Matrix universe that might not have anything to do with the main story - and hopefully takes place entirely in the Matrix.

The DVD video quality is very good. The sound quality is superb - it easily bests the original Matrix movie sound mix on DVD or Blu-ray.",1401235200,,447,4.321428571428571
