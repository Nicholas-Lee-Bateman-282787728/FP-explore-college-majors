4710137,3,B005IUJI14,"I stun myself when I keep saying this: The WWE produces some decent-to-excellent flicks. They're all action of course; but there is, amazingly, an underlying strength of story and plot in their productions. Don't care if it's formulaic. They're spot on and entertaining. Which is a far cry from the astounding amount of pretentious, ridiculous and generally worthless films that are pooped out every year from all corners of the globe.

John Cena, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dwayne-Johnson/dp/B00016MSV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dwayne Johnson</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steve-Austin/dp/B0035G5IZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steve Austin</a>, has the abilities to become a full-fledged actor. Like his compatriots, he projects much more than his biceps; I'm talking for-real thespian skills. Now, obviously, we're not discussing a run toward an Oscar. But I won't diminish the solid efforts of these performers simply because their background is in the form of a canvas mat and not a New York or London acting studio.

And the consistent ironic element when I review their films: I can't stand professional wrestling. <g>

In this production, Cena plays one of four siblings - three brothers and a sister. They, like the classic tv show 'Bonanza' (which is often referred to by the characters), have the same father but were born to different mothers. And each one is completely unlike the others.

The first born brother is a hot-tempered police officer, recently suspended from the job for constantly manhandling the perps and skels. Second in line is a wannabe businessman who looks and acts more like a con-man. Their kid brother is a thief, but a young man with a very gentle and kind soul. And their sister is the only 'normal' one out of the bunch. Although the film doesn't delve into her character, it's apparent that she is the only sibling who leads a typically average life.

They've reunited after many years of separation, mostly by choice and one instance of circumstance, to bury their father and collect on a $12 million dollar inheritance. The older brothers just want to receive their share of the money and get away from each other as soon as possible. However, and you knew this was coming, there's a catch. Their filial sister has been named executor of the estate. And she has every intention of fulfilling their father's last wish - that all his children get back together to form a successful business. One that has to function for two years before the inheritance can be distributed.

This forces the siblings together, whether they like it or not; obviously more the latter less the former. Clearly not the ideal situation to form an enterprise, much less a successful one.

Still, as the eldest, Cena, having recently been suspended again from the force, is without a paycheck. His weasel brother is in hock up to his eyeballs. And his newly discovered baby brother was recently released from prison. He decides that perhaps this might be a way to earn some coin during his official conduct review, which honestly does not bode well for him or his police career. So, if they have to work with one another for the next couple of years, they decide bounty hunting is a business they can all contribute toward. And they even have a job ready at hand.

Brother number two, played by funny Ethan Embry, is a bail bondsman who laid out his last penny getting a serious scumbag out on provisional release. No surprise, the convict disappeared. And if the runner doesn't show up for his court appearance, he's out $50K.

But what seems like a straight-forward skip trace, quickly escalates into a much bigger problem. While on bail release, it turns out their bail jumper played a key role in the kidnapping of a billionaire. This exacerbates a simple mission into something much more complicated - and the problems associated with the kidnapping, which includes an attempted assassination of the brothers, get progressively worse.

While 'Reunion' isn't an award contender, and it's clearly not intended for that audience, it's obviously meeting the demands of the action/comedy market. And speaking as one cinephile - I enjoyed it enough to justify a rental fee.",1324425600,,4300,5.245997088791849
4710138,4,B005IUJI14,"Nina Cleary's (Amy Smart) father recently died with his last wish being to bring his three sons of suspended cop Sam (John Cena) & bail bondsman Leo (Ethan Embry) & ex-con Douglas (Boyd Holbrook) together so as a condition of his will, they will each collect an inheritance of $3 million if they were to run a family business together for two years.  There is clear tension between Sam & Rico as they haven't seen each other in a decade while the youngest one in Douglas had never met any of his siblings previously.  Meanwhile, a couple of hitmen take a corporation owner in Kyle Wills (Gregg Henry) hostage into Mexico with one of the kidnappers being identified as Leo's bailjumper named Edgar (Rio Alexander) who left him in debt, the brothers are convinced to go find him & get the reward money.  In Mexico, they run into various issues such as getting information from Edgar's famous girlfriend who just happens to have an eye for Douglas, a drug lord named Verdugo (J.D. Garfield) who tells them to leave town or be killed, the kidnappers trying to kill them, meeting up with a woman named Theresa Trujillo (Lela Loren) who ends up having a common enemy with the boys, and the brothers trying to tolerate each other throughout the entire venture.

I will say that I've enjoyed this movie more than the recent WWE films releases as the attempts at comedy/action were good & not overdone.  This was a different movie than Cena's previous two are he did more acting here than we've seen from his previous two action based movies (""The Marine"" & ""12 Rounds"") while everyone else played their parts well so this is a movie I would watch more than a second time & recommend for a viewing.",1323129600,6,1689,4.598006644518272
4710139,5,B005IUJI14,"The movie opens with a number of disconnected subplots: A rich man in a limo shows a disinterest in his son, a man (Boyd Holbrook) getting out of prison, a woman (Amy Smart) looking around a kitchen, a bail bondsman (Ethan Embry) screaming on the phone, and a cop (John Cena) on suspension. The rich man is kidnapped by Mexicans and as it turns out the other 4 are all 1/2 brothers/sister and their common estranged dad, who was worth millions, has just passed on. The catch is that in order to share $12 million, the four of them, who all hate each other, must work together in a family business for two years...without killing each other.

So what family business do these 4 open up? As it turns out one of the Mexicans who has kidnapped the millionaire is a bail skip for Ethan Embry. Ethan knows that this Mexican hung out at an unnamed strip club in Mexico with a girl named ""Angela."" So all they have to do is go find him. Amy (plays a small role) loves all of her brothers unconditionally because they are family. The brothers tolerate each other at best. What I thought was going to be an action flick was a good comedy-action-drama. My fears that a wrestler would stink it up were unwarranted as John Cena did an impressive job...for a wrestler. The dialouge was simple and amusing. The plot had enough action to hold my interest. The movie sets up for an interesting sequel. This is a good ""B"" action-drama film. 4 1/2 stars

4710140,3,B005IUJI14,"""What are the 3 of us gonna do together for 2 years without killing each other?""  After the death of thier father 3 brothers are reunited with thier sister and get news about the will.  They will each inherit 3 million dollars, if they can work together for 2 years.  That's where the problems begin.  This is a very surprising movie.  Very funny and enjoyable throughout.  Nothing really that amazing here but very entertaining.  This is the type of movie that you can predict what happens next as you watch, but that does not hurt the movie at all.  This is a different type of role for John Cena as it is more comedy oriented but enough of him beating people up to appease his fans.  This is not a movie to rush out and watch, but this is one that you will not be disappointed when you see it.  Overall, a very funny and entertaing way to spend an hour and a half.  I give it a B+.

4710156,5,B005IUJI14,"The Reunion was a very well written and enjoyable movie.  The acting is great, with Amy Smart being especially good and believable.  The story also has a depth which surprised me.  The four adult children of an alcoholic and abusive father (they all have different mothers) come together when the father dies.

The psychological undercurrent in the characters is portrayed accurately and with great understanding of how adult children of abuse can respond.

The plot is fun and the movie has a great pace.  Humorous and adventurous, and by the end of the movie I genuinely liked the characters.

Some mild violence, and some bleeped language in the end credits, but otherwise a great film for most all ages.

I rate this movie a sold A",1410220800,,735,4.777777777777778

4710159,4,B005IUJI14,"This is a funny movie!

It has a very Western-style theme to it, so if you like Westerns, you might like this one.
The DVD arrived in good shape and the movie played flawlessly.

It is certainly not an award-winning plot, but it is very entertaining. I bought it solely because Ethan Embry was in it, but was surprised to find that I genuinely enjoyed the story.

For those Amy Smart fans, her role in the movie is not nearly as big as I thought it would be. She is only in the beginning and the end.

I recommend watching this movie.",1396310400,,534,4.205882352941177
4710160,5,B005IUJI14,"I have to say that I find the majority (not all) of the WWE movies to be very entertaining and fun. ""The Reunion"" definitely falls into that category. Amy Smart is in it at the beginning and end only but we get Denise Chanian and I thought she was terrific. The plot 3 brothers get together to find a bail jumper and kidnap victim and they don't get along and don't know the younger brother. Much more to it but it would take forever to tell it. Boyd Holbrook as the youngest and unknown brother who is also a thief and really great with the ladies is sweet and innocently adorable. Ethan Embry as the middle brother, is a bail bondsman and is really angry at his older brother. Finally John Cena, the older suspended from the police force for excessive violence brother is terrific. All 3 brothers play their parts great and you love watching the bond grow.

4710173,5,B005IUJI14,"Saw this on Showtime today--enjoyed it so much I'm buying a copy.  I loved the interaction of the self-named 'Bonanza' brothers.  John Cena plays the older brother, we have the middle brother and Little Joe.  They all bring different personalities and attributes to this adventure (police officer, bail bondsman and criminal)  The younger brother (the criminal)  had been a juvenile offender and spent time on a ranch--the scene  where he tames an abused horse to ride is an example of what makes this movie 'human' and not just an epic with a bunch of muscle bound guys running around blowing things up.  The characters resemble those in one of my favorite movies ""Bandits"".  These brothers are also just men in phoney red capes--the adventure doesn't go as planned, but they are together and that was their father's and sisters goal.  Any mom would want to hug these boys.",1384732800,,874,4.851351351351352

8475073,5,B005IUJI14,"THE REUNION

This is easily one of my favorite films from WWE. This flick stars John Cena along with Ethan Embry, Boyd Holbrook, and Amy Smart and they make for a great group as siblings. Despite what people say about Cena I think he has done just fine as an actor. In fact it is this film here that I think he seems most natural, maybe because he had done a few prior to this and he was settling into acting. He did well in his first two flicks for WWE in The Marine and 12 Rounds but it was his performance in Legendary that really impressed me.

Here we meet four siblings, three brothers and one sister, who come together for the first time as a group after their father has died. They will be getting what he left behind in his will but there is a catch, they must all work together in a family business if they can do so and stay together they get the money. Well it just so happen that the middle brother runs a bail bond company and he needs to bring in a guy who skipped out on him. so they go into the bounty hunting business but their first case takes them into something that is much bigger than one guy skipping out.

S movie was really enjoyable to me but I cant really pinpoint what it was. The action is good but not as big as other WWE films and while funny it isn't overly so. Maybe it is the dynamic between the siblings here, particularly the three brothers once they go on their adventure. The chemistry between these guys shines through the screen and you can tell that these guys had a great time making the movie together. So much so that I would really like to see a sequel to this film, make that happen WWE.

The DVD comes with behind the scenes and making of stuff but I wish there would have been an audio commentary. It would have been a great to get our four stars along with writer/director Mike Pavone on there cutting up and talking about the movie. Pavone also wrote, directed or produced many for films for the WWE like Legendary, Knucklehead, The Chaperone, Thats What I Am, Inside Out, Bending the Rules and Barricade.",1423526400,,2056,4.237244897959184
