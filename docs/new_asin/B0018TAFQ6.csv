3421032,1,B0018TAFQ6,"Let me start by saying that the purpose of this review is of course to prevent other potential buyers of this product from wasting their time and money as I have done.
My negative review of this garbage in no way reflects my opinion of the video game for which it is supposed to serve as a prequel to. The video game Dead Space is a monumentally fun and scary game for which I easily give 4 stars to, however, Dead Space: Downfall is a huge dissappointment.
Not only is Dead Space: Downfall a complete bore to watch, its short in length, seems hastily put together to promote the video game, and isn't even a real prequel as it does absolutely nothing to clarify any confusion with the loose plot of the game.
If you've played the game and have anxiously awaited seeing this movie thinking that it would give you some insight into the storyline or even get you excited about playing the game, you're in for a big letdown. Key characters in the game are completely left out of the movie and virtually no cohesive storyline is even attempted. It's sad really because had the movie's makers actually created a real prequel to the game, it could have been wonderful. But they didn't, and it's not. The bottom line is that it's obvious that the makers of this movie didn't have the chance to play through the final market version of the game.
Dead Space: Downfall is just a failed attempt at hyping a great video game. Don't believe me? Rent before you buy, you'll be glad that you did.",1225756800,14,1481,4.448529411764706

Watch them in that order so you know what's really going on :)",1225497600,2,191,4.457142857142857
3421034,5,B0018TAFQ6,"This Movie was perfect in setting the story for the game which follows right after it finishes, ill try my best to keep any and all spoilers out of this, so u can get the full experience of the movie & game for yourself

This gives u an insight as to how everything kicks off, whats what, why are things like this in the game, where the alien scourge came from, what the actual events on the Ishimura were that lead to its complete ""Down-Fall""

if your intrested in the Game ""Dead Space"" then i highly recommend that you watch this first so you can start the game off with some knowledge as to whats going on, as for me it hightened the game experience for me i would hope that it does that same for you",1225324800,3,703,4.124087591240876
3421035,5,B0018TAFQ6,"Here we have a really good, and incredibly disturbing animated sci-fi Horror film! `Dead Space: Downfall' is a full-length film which serves as a very cool prequel to the video game that was just unleashed onto the world. Just in time for Halloween, this movie serves up a nice big plate of blood, guts, and sci-fi monster horror.

Weather you are a fan of Dead Space, animation, horror, or science fiction this is one of those movies that just hits your geek glands in all the right places. It is ultra violent and very clever in the way they execute the story and action sequences. This animated movie does not hold back on the blood, violence, and action. The creative team really takes it to a whole new level on American animated violence.

The film takes place on a spacecraft during a mining mission. They uncover an ancient artifact that they think may prove the existence of God. The only problem is it seems like it proves more of the existent of the devil. It's like a Pandora's Box and the crew just opened it. The crew remove the artifact from its resting place and bring it onto the ship, because it sounded like a good idea at the time. So what happens? Only one of the worst things imaginable. A long-dormant alien race is unleashed on the ship, to viciously tear apart, and take over every human on board. The crew is totally unprepared for this madness, and it turns into one hell of a crazy blood bath battle for survival. A little slice of heaven that transforms the spacecraft into a living hell.

I had a great time watching this movie. The action comes at you really fast and once it starts there is no letting up. One scene after another you get bombarded with fun badassery as you follow a small group of soldiers trying to survive the carnage that beats down on them.

Just to give you an idea, if I were to compare this movie to any other film it would be `Event Horizon'. `Dead Space: Downfall' is actually a better film than most of the horror films Hollywood has been releasing in theaters recently.

You gotta watch this movie!",1225324800,5,2058,4.477333333333333

3421037,5,B0018TAFQ6,"Okay, let's get this out of the way first. The animation is rendered by an American animation studio, Film Roman, but the action scenes are all anime inspired. On that alone I give it props. The image is clean and crisp, but the TRUE HD audio really kicks when the blasting starts. It sort of reminds me of ""Dark Fury"" and Aeon Flux, just a smidge.

I blind bought this and it was worth it, I'm off to buy the game.",1225238400,4,415,4.1234567901234565
3421038,1,B0018TAFQ6,"Very generic animation movie - the prequel to the videogame. Silly thing is they've taken 70min of animation that could've been easily been summed up into 5min FMV. A ship collects a mysterious statue from a planet, the people who were sent onto the planet get infected, the spacecraft goes back to the main ship and everybody gets infected or turned into a monster.

There's only really one type of monster too, the ones who look exactly like humans but have pointy arms and legs (guts may be spilling out). The animation on the creatures is repetitive, the backgrounds don't really work too well with the characters (lack of detail), the characters aren't interesting aside from using the f word every 5 seconds and the storyline goes nowhere

May be worth watching if you're intending to play the game but I'd stick with a rental",1225238400,4,838,4.726027397260274

3421040,3,B0018TAFQ6,"Dead Space: Downfall serves its purpose as being a decent animated prelude to EA's great space based survival horror video game, delivering the goods in terms of blood and gore.  However, there's little else to be found than that here, and that may be absolutely fine with you.  The story revolves around the uncovering of an ancient artifact, and the events that transpire afterwards that involve people going insane and murdering one another.  Before you know it, there's mutated zombie beasts running amok, and no one is safe.  What Dead Space: Downfall does manage to accomplish is explain some plot points from the video game, as well as set-up what to expect if you haven't played it yet.  Other than provide ample amounts of bloody, gorey violence, the animation itself is pretty lackluster.  Things aren't really helped much thanks to some atrocious dialogue and a cliche script from the comic book writing tandem of Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray (whose work has ranged from great to awful) that becomes hard to follow in the midst of all the violence.  Still, Dead Space: Downfall has a great music score, some genuinely creppy moments, and decent voice talent that includes Bruce Boxleitner and Kelly Hu.  All in all, Dead Space: Downfall serves as being a decent animated prelude to EA's great game, and for fans who have played it already or are looking to, this animated dirge is worth a look.",1225152000,36,1408,4.861924686192468

It seems to spark a wave of homicidal attacks by ordinary normal people.
As the space ship with artifact lifts off the planet population self destructs. A monsters and blood type horror film that
should probably not be seen by younger people.
The animation is not all that good by the voice acting is first quality.
There is a mystery connecting the artifact to the earth church and the

3421058,3,B0018TAFQ6,"It's fun in that mindless entertainment sort of way (which isn't really a good thing since the movie is supposed to be serious). I really wanted to love this movie, but I can't deny the facts: it's too thin on plot, it's too bland overall, and there's nothing really unique going on. The violence is so over the top that it really failed to even affect me by the time I made it halfway through the movie.
But it's an okay movie. I love the animation. Only recently have I become interested in different animated movies and series, but there's something very appealing about animation, and Dead Space: Downfall, if nothing else, is very well animated (even if a bit cheap-ish looking). The aliens were pretty cool looking.
It's only a three star movie, true, but I won't lie, for some reason I am so excited to see the sequel. At only an hour and fifteen minutes or so, I'd say it's worth watching this movie once, especially if you're a fan of space horror. Also, if you're a fan of gore (you sicko) then you'll be more than satisfied with the heavy dose in Dead Space Downfall.",1433289600,,1078,4.44949494949495

The cartoon is about a space mining crew that unearths an ancient artifact that's believed to have the answers to the origin of man. But as it turns out the artifact is keeping murderous creatures from being released. This is a prequel to a popular video game of the same name. It was good but i expected better.

3421078,3,B0018TAFQ6,"PRECISION: I never played the ""Dead Space"" game, therefore I review this film as if it was just a ""stand alone"" SF anime, not connected to the wider universe created by the initial game and its two sequels. This review contains limited SPOILERS.

After watching ""Dead space: downfall"" I must say that it was a rather honest SF/zombie flick, albeit unusual as it is a cartoon or if you prefer an anime.

The film begins when an alien artefact, nicknamed ""The Marker"", is discovered on the planet Aegis VII. The Church of Unitology, which seems to be amongst the main institutions ruling this particular universe, mandates the captain of the mining ship USG Ishimura to retrieve ""The Marker"", which is considered as a kind of holy relic.

While the ship approaches her crew receives radio reports of an outbreak of violent behaviour among the colonists. ""The Marker"" is brought aboard and then ship's Head of Security Alissa Vincent asks to investigate the colony. And then the film really begins...

This film is a kind of prequel to the three ""Dead Space"" games and therefore some of things shown on the screen are not really explained, as the director assumed that viewers will be already familiar with them - we are especially NOT informed about what exactly is the Church of Unitology and why does it considers ""The Markers"" (it seems there is more than one) as such holy items. But fully understanding  those things is not absolutely necessary, as the film quickly focuses on the fate of USG Ishimura and her crew. Alissa Vincent and her security team are the main heroes of the film.

The story is fast paced, there is lot of action scenes and they are mostly good, dialogs are quite honest for a SF/action anime and there is even some humour, mostly in form of verbal sniping between two security team members, a rookie named Dobbs and a seriously weird girl named Shen. The character of Alissa Vincent is rather well done and she is definitely more interesting than the usual ""chick with gun from action movies"". The film is surprisingly violent and even gory for an anime, the butcher bill is very heavy and the general atmosphere is very, very dark and tragic.

Therefore, even if you are not a fan of the ""Dead Space"" games but just an amateur of Sci-Fi and action movies, this quite entertaining little film can be an interesting viewing. I am rather glad that I discovered it and I think that I will keep the DVD on the special shelf reserved to SF curiosities.",1391472000,2,2473,4.671264367816092
3421079,3,B0018TAFQ6,"This is a very forgettable cartoon with little originality. The artistic execution per se meets the standards of the genre. The story itself is banal; about greedy people finding a dangerous alien object and suffering the consequences. The characters are stereotypical and psychologically unrealistic. The only somewhat original and vaguely interesting element is the notion of a religious leadership cabal usurping political power and duping its followers toward sinister purposes, but this idea is not well developed.",1391212800,,519,5.753246753246753

Part of the fun of the first game is how the story unfolds, and watching the video after playing the first game will help if you are still confused. The story will be better if you play the game first.

The video animation itself is not the best. Voice acting is really good, however. There is a lot of gore in this film.

Kudos to those who decided to make a video based on a game series. That is why I gave this a 5 rating instead of a 4. More entertainment choices are always nice.",1360713600,,575,4.218181818181818

The leader in this genre used to be Japanese anime films, but now there is a decent number of respectable English language productions.  Here we have Dead Space: Downfall, a direct to DVD release about a future where human society is ruled by one church.  This church has infiltrated a journey to another world to collect an artifact from their mythology.  However, the trip runs afoul of horrific evil, including creatures that turn people into cannibalistic, violent creatures.  This short movie features lots of action, blood, gore, and language.  However, the animation is average, well below that of today's animated big-screen releases from Disney, Dreamworks or Pixar.  The storyline is familiar to those who have played the Dead Space video games.  The cast of voices are mainly nobodies in Hollywood.

I wasn't aware it was old-school animation at first (I assumed a 3D CGI game would have a 3D CGI movie ... totally wrong there).

The story definitely helps to set the stage for the game, but the animation style is far short of what I'd expect for a film based on a graphic-intensive game.  The dialog of the movie also leaves much to be desired.

3421100,3,B0018TAFQ6,"This is the back story leading up to the first Dead Space video game.

We find out how the USG Ishimura became overrun during the outbreak that started on Aegis VII. The Ishimura was sent to mine the planet for materials, but then the Marker was discovered. Suddenly the colonists were beginning to commit suicide and murder each other, presumably influenced by the Marker's power.

Crew members of the Ishimura struggle amongst each other over their belief systems, and what the Marker truly represents. Their confidence in their captain's ability to remain objective both as a leader and as a Unitologist is challenged also.

As you might imagine, everything goes to Hell once the outbreak reaches the ship.

There is no appearance or mention of Isaac Clarke, and the Necromorphs/creatures seem crude in appearance, and there is an overall lack of detail in the visual style of everything.

But- This movie is inexpensive enough, and it is pretty cool after all. So if you like DS as much as
I do, than you've probably already decided to buy it. I'd say it's worth it.

3421107,3,B0018TAFQ6,"I've always been a big fan of Dead Space, the misbegotten love child of several sci-fi horror franchises combined into one gloriously freaky video game. The setting features the blue-collar grittiness of ""Alien"" crossed with the body morphing horror of ""The Thing."" In Dead Space you play Isaac Clarke (an amalgam of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, titans of sci-fi), a man on a mission. ""Dead Space: Downfall"" is what happened to the USG Ishimura, a ""planetcracker"" ship dedicated to mining massive amounts of material from planets.

Dead Space shares more in common than just horror in space with ""Alien""; the Nostromo was also towing mineral ore when it encountered an alien life form. Because these are civilians up against an alien threat, the weapons of choice in Dead Space are mining tools. ""Dead Space: Downfall"" tries to balance the thematic lead up to the video game with the necessary requirements of a heavily-armed security crew gunning for necromorphs.

About those necromorphs. The Dead Space franchise is a little unclear on how they are formed. They are tied in some way to something called the Red Marker, an object that looks a lot like a DNA strand that just happens to be a holy relic of the Church of Unitology. The Marker drives people nuts that come into contact with it and also, maybe, possibly reanimates the dead with an alien lifeform. Or maybe flying sheet monsters do it as depicted in the ""Downfall.""

Whatever the case, necromorphs are bad news, animating the humanoid form in creative ways, some of which are taken straight from John Carpenter's ""The Thing."" It takes the crew a while to figure out what's going on, and by then it's too late - the more people die, the more necromorphs spring up.

The action begins with the miners on the planetoid, slowly going bonkers as they finish up mining the planet Aegis VII. It's not hard to equate the discovery of the Red Marker with the insanity outbreak, which soon shifts to the Ishimura. Like ""Alien,"" corporate greed has a role in Captain Mathius' (Jim Cummings) decision to ignore the rising paranoia of his crew. Sanity falls to head of security Alissa Vincent (Nike Futterman) and ship's doctor Kyne (Keith Szarabajka). Alissa arms up and, with her security team in tow, goes bug hunting.

Thematically, this movie is inspired by ""Alien"" and then when the guns come out, ""Aliens,"" but it never quite strikes the right balance between the two. The work ethic of regular Joes up against an alien threat is disrupted by a peculiar cyberpunk-looking Shen (Kelly Hu), with a shaved head and impractical long locks that make her a very poor choice for security. When the massive Unitologist engineer Samuel Irons (Kevin Michael Richardson, who voices a character in every cartoon these days) shows up, it's hard to see him as a regular guy - he's so big he looks like he could smash necromorphs with his fists alone. Any horror that might be gained from sympathizing with the folks on the Ishimura fades with Alissa's awful rah-rah dialogue. She's like an imitation of the Marines from ""Aliens"" without actually earning her stripes.

Anyone who knows the plot of the Dead Space game knows that the crew is doomed; conversely, finding out what happened to the crew is part of the horror of the game, which leaves ""Downfall"" in the peculiar position of dissatisfying any audience that might be interested in it. It's not a terrible film, but a weak copy of better horror movies that have gone before.",1340236800,,3483,4.816053511705686
3421108,2,B0018TAFQ6,"This movie is not unwatchable...it's just not very good.  From a ""movie/storytelling"" standpoint, it has flat characters that aren't worth caring about, terrible dialogue (lots of swearing to appeal to 14 year old boys, I guess?), and kind of crummy animation.  I feel like there is a trend for American movie makers to use ""anime"" style artwork as a sort of gimmick, but to loss of good storytelling (""Batman: Gotham Knight"", most of ""The Animatrix"", some others I cannot think of).
From a video game fan standpoint, the movie suffers from a lack of relation to the game, and a failure to develop characters we learn about but never meet in-game.  Where is Security Officer Temple?  That guy was awesome in the audio logs!  And Dr Mercer?  Surely we could have learned more about him.  I could go on, but you get the idea.

An example that sticks out in particular is the video shows the marker being black - it is actually red (and the scale of the marker in the video is ambiguously larger than it really is). Also, the necromorphs are not afraid of the marker, but the video portrays it otherwise. Finally, the video shows the primary source of infection is the flying bat things - in the game story, that is only one of the forms of spreading the infection.

3421116,3,B0018TAFQ6,"(This review is mostly for people who are curious about this animated sci-fi horror-survival movie and not familiar or interested in the video games)

After watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Space-Aftermath/dp/B0047S4USO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Space: Aftermath</a>&nbsp;I was curious enough to go back and watch the first movie in the series, partly because of B5's Bruce Boxleitner voice-acting in it. If you haven't seen either one, start with ""Downfall"" and then watch ""Aftermath"", although both can be watched stand alone.

This animated movie is centered around the discovery of an alien artifact on another planet and the spaceship involved in the recovery of this artifact. As the genre suggests, this is a horror/gore/survival type of a movie, but because it is animated, the gore is not as stomach turning as it would have been if it was a live-action movie. It is a relatively interesting and watchable movie, action-packed. Just like Aftermath, they are more along the lines of the Syfy Original Movies than 2001 or Battlestar Galactica.

In terms of production and such, Downfall is not as polished as Aftermath, but then again, Aftermath came out 2+ years later, which in the world of computers/animation is a longer time than in might sound.

Because this is intended as an introduction to the game, it does not need to have the stereotypical plot flow and conclusion, which (intentionally or not) is a plus since I am sure a lot of us are tired of predictable formulaic movie endings.

My opinion if you are not a fan of the game or a Boxleitner die-hard must-have everything fan: watch the movie first (rental, cable, etc) and then decide whether you want to make the DVD/BluRay purchase.",1297468800,,1768,5.345323741007194

3421133,5,B0018TAFQ6,"I know nothing of Dead Space, I'm by far no gamer, but Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray have written a nastily brutal animated movie of alien-invasion zombie take-over. WARNING:  Spoilers Hereafter. The story centers around an alien religious artifact's entrapment of a human space crew. Thinking they've discovered the find of the century, they learn too late that the alien life form actually conspired with their minds to get the humans to remove and transport the artifact to a new and viable home where it can find innumerable new hosts for their parasitic selves. And the story is as nasty and brutal as it gets. This is a full run of scenes of killing, violence, biological degradation of one species upon another, lots of guts, lots of blood, lots of screams, a little bit of redemptive but all-too-sad sacrifice of self for others, murder, beatings, vomiting, horrific hallucinations, and, to top it all off, the cult classic scene of the year:  SYRINGE TO THE EYE! To state the obvious, this is not for the kiddies. This is just profanity-laced violence stacked upon violence. That doesn't mean, though, that there aren't things to like here. Alissa Vincent is a female leader in charge of a crack commando team who makes it to the very end, although, she dies, too. But I love the opening scene where she picks up her coffee cup and we see her cup  blotter: a bloody picture of the USG Ishimura's latest homicide victim. And then there's Samuel Irons, a monolithic, kind-hearted, wise giant of a man who works as an engineer and, though he disagrees with the way the religious artifact is, in his opinion, being manhandled, he is the biggest and strongest force in saving as many people as possible until the very end. Technically, the animation is pretty good (not the best I've ever seen, but probably a 4 out of 5), the voice actors chosen do a great job (although I still can't understand how people can scream on cue, but these folks do the job over and over and over and over), and the story, even for its seemingly simple plot line of kill or be killed makes you get rather philosophical about life and death and how in the world we can face the end when we truly know that there is no hope. As to price, I got this at a well-reduced used price, probably wouldn't have paid full retail for it, but if you like what Palmiotti and Gray are doing with DC's Jonah Hex or are quite into the game, I can't think of a better alien story after Alien.

3421134,3,B0018TAFQ6,"While I normally like to go into a good amount of depth into my reviews, I'm keeping this one a little short since there really isn't a lot to explain for Dead Space Downfall.

Dead Space Downfall serves as a prequel to the hit video game (and one of my personal favorites), Dead Space.  On a remote mining colony called Aegis VII, an alien artifact (simply called the Marker) is extracted and many of the miners involved in the operation believe it's proof that God exists.  However, ever since the Marker was extracted, murders and homicides have increased drastically on the colony.  The mining ship (aka ""planet cracker"") USG Ishimura comes in to break off the section of the planet containing the Marker and the artifact itself is brought on the Ishimura.  One of the miners down on the colony sees his wife or girlfriend (don't know exactly the relationship) kill herself with a laser-tipped pickax and the miner puts her body on a small transport shuttle, heading back to the Ishimura.  However, he doesn't know that a Necromorph alien snuck on the shuttle and infested the dead woman's body, turning her into a flesh-eating monstrosity, killing the miner and crashing the shuttle in the Ishimura's hangar bay; from that moment on, all hell breaks loose on the ship.  Me and my friends like to poke fun at this scene by saying this:

""Congratulations!!  You just created the plot for an entire video game!!""

I'd like to get the bad stuff out of the way first.  While the plot is somewhat interesting (particularly the struggle between the Unitologists and the ""nonbelievers"") and sets up the story pretty nicely for the Dead Space video game, these events are predictable if you've played the game.  Character development is completely absent in this cinematic bloodbath and there's not much depth to them at all, either.  The characters pretty much remain the same throughout the feature and exist solely for the plot.

Since an interesting plot and intriguing, dymanic characters are what make a film great, you may be asking ""Duckman, what's the saving grace of Dead Space Downfall?""  What makes DSD worth watching on occasion is its indulgence in completely mindless yet enjoyable violence.  There's more violence in DSD than you can shake a Plasma Cutter at, and when taken by itself, it's pretty fun to watch.  The Necromorphs are ripping the Ishimura's crew members to pieces and head of security, Alyssa Vincent, has to lead her subordinates into this hell and do what they can to save the ship.  Vincent and her crew initially combat the Necromorphs with guns, but when an engineer named Irons comes into the picture with some sort of energy saw, that's when the action gets better.  I can watch the crew members decapitate the Necromorphs with those tools all day since nothing says ""awesome"" more than that.  While this method of combat sure is awesome, I was kinda disappointed that they limited themselves to using those tools when they could have used such great tools for the job like the Force Gun, Line Cutter, and Blowtorch.  Though I must say, I laughed pretty hard when that fat naked guy in the shower room got ripped into pieces by one of the aliens.

While most movies based off video games have little or nothing in common with the game they're based off of (particularly that cinematic disaster known as Super Mario Bros.), I do have to commend Dead Space Downfall for following the Ishimura's design, character designs, and Necromorph designs down to a T.  The Necromorph designs are excellent for their originality and repulsion factor since they're horribly distorted human cadavers with spikes, tentacles, and razor-sharp teeth galore.  The baby corpses with tentacles have to be my favorite Necromorph designs since they're so unexpected and hideous.

The voice acting is pretty decent, bordering on average at times.  The best voice acting came from none other than Jim Cummings (known for his voices for Winnie the Pooh, Darkwing Duck, and Dr. Robotnik in SatAM Sonic) as the horribly deranged Unitologist and captain of the Ishimura, Captain Mathias.  Since Cummings has a penchant for voicing deranged tyrant-like characters, he was perfect for that role since Mathias doesn't care about the safety of his crew, he just wants to bring the Marker back to the Church of Unitology.

The animation and artwork is pretty decent, though nothing really special.  Pretty standard 2D animation fused with standard 3D animation.

When all is said and done, Dead Space Downfall is a mindless gore-infested popcorn flick that's fun to watch on occasion.  While people looking for nothing but animated gore may like this, I would recommend this only to fans of the Dead Space video game since fans of that game would hold more appreciation for Dead Space Downfall than viewers who haven't played the game.",1250467200,2,4834,4.916256157635468

3421136,3,B0018TAFQ6,"Dead Space: Downfall (Chuck Patton, 2008)

Short (seventy-four minute), sweet animated flick that did exactly what it was supposed to in my case: made me want to play Dead Space. Conceived as a prequel to the game, it tells the story of how the artifact (and the zombies) got onto the ship in the first place. A fun story and some decent voice acting, but the level of animation is somewhere between Saturday morning cartoons and Terrence and Philip. For hardcore videogame fans rather than animation buffs, but as long as you're willing to accept the crude animation, not too bad. ** ",1248739200,,585,4.7254901960784315

I was really set on just buying the movie but thankfully a friend found a way to just rent it from the Xbox movie store.  I'm glad I just rented it.  Downfall is a short prequel to the game so don't expect much out of it.  It answers a few questions from the game and fills in for how the whole mess started but really nothing too revealing.  The animation is good but at times seems choppy and a few frame rates short.  The length of the movie seems appropriate but it all just feels rushed and ends too quickly, it could've been drawn out a lot.  There is a crap load of blood in this flick, seriously, don't let the kids watch this, not unless you're ready to pay for at least 5 years of therapy.  If you're a diehard fan of Dead Space the game, then you'll love this, otherwise just try and watch it for free or without paying too much.

3421138,4,B0018TAFQ6,"The video game industry is one awesome profitable industry. It's funny when you think about it, since the industry started with games like ""Space Invaders"" and the dawn of the Sega Genesis. Capcom's ""Resident Evil"" and ""Street Fighter"" have spawned several mainstream movies in its wake, Akklaim also with the ""Mortal Kombat"" franchise. Now, EA's science fiction survival horror game ""DEAD SPACE"" is a marketing giant in itself, and studios have come up with a sequel of sorts in the form of ""DEADSPACE: DOWNFALL"". Those who have played the game is no doubt familiar with its violent, brutality and bloody nature. I haven't played the game, but this film certainly has made me wish I had.

In a remote planet colony of Aegis, the mining ship USG Ishimura is summoned to tow an ancient alien artifact and a human colony. A large hole is cut in the ground and the huge artifact is taken aboard the ship. But before the ship becomes en-route to its coordinates, strange things begin to happen in the planet below. People begin to lose control of their actions, mutilating themselves and killing one another in a flurry of gruesome deaths. There appears to be an alien force behind all this, a mysterious alien race came along the artifact for the ride. They kill, and mutate their victims into mutated killers that wish to feed on human flesh. The captain of the Ishimura is adamant on bringing the artifact to Earth and such a move can bring major disaster. Alyssa Vincent (voiced by Nika Futterman) is the ship's security chief and serves as the only reasonable person amid all the madness. She and her team of crack mercenaries are the only hope for the remaining crew of the Ishimura as they blast the mutated zombies with guns, laser pick axs and saws. But it may already be too late...

""Deadspace: Downfall"" is one film that relies on its best assets to deliver on its entertainment value. The film itself feels a small part of a rather huge whole, offering very little characterization and the qualities of the mysterious artifact is only mildly touched upon. The film also hints at certain religious misconceptions and human error. The premise of a crew stuck in space with an alien menace have been done before by movies such as ""Alien"" and ""Event Horizon"". While the film offers little new, what makes it succeed is the manner of which it unfolds, with certain scenes of action and gore nicely placed throughout the screenplay to deliver an intense atmosphere.

Ok, so the film is animated and the gore scenes can't look all that real right? Well, being animated, the film does have its weaknesses in delivering its blood and gore factor. Even with its nicely done animation, the film's bloody scenes may look rather gross, but cannot really compare to the awesome gross-out factor of a live-action film. To compensate, the film's violence is actually on overdrive, as we see mutilated limbs, entrails being devoured, sliced heads, decapitations, essentially, no one is left unscathed. The film is flashy, and brutally violent; it is definitely not for the faint of heart--the film is an unrelenting bloodbath.

There was one scene when a religious man named Irons made himself a decoy for others to get away. It was a practice in pure courageous sacrifice that gave the film some emotional impact. It may seem contrived at first, but the director Chuck Patton managed to play out the scene very well. The characters may lack very little characterization, but what little development there may be is seen in its violent encounters. The adage ""action speaks louder than words"" comes to mind, I had no difficulty connecting with the protagonists as I see them fight for their lives. The film is also full of creepy atmosphere, and has that touch of simplicity which I liked. It was also paced well, and its 75 minute run time provides the intense but breezy experience needed to keep the screenplay compact. Going a little longer may make the film a little repetitive, I was happy to see its direction practice a sense of restraint.

While the film isn't without its faults, the weak plot development may seem a little contrived at times and some of the motivations weren't fully fleshed out; I found the film quite enjoyable for a direct to dvd movie. I know that this was meant as a background for the game, and a small part of a whole, and I am sure those who played the game can make better sense of its storyline. I am pretty sure that fans of the game would no doubt be interested, heck, it made me curious as to what the game is about.

""Dead Space: Downfall"" will not become a classic but it makes use of its best assets to the maximum in narrative. The kill scenes were quite inventive and violent, and the action more than compensates for its weaknesses. It may be feel a little empty if you are unfamiliar with its source material but I guess I'm just happy to see American studios going over the stereotype that cartoons are all meant for kids. The film channels the best its got quite well, I found it very entertaining.

3421139,5,B0018TAFQ6,"Well, to start off, if you think this movie does not piece the game together at all, you are wrong. True it does not show any weapons relevant to the game or even show any people that made video or audio logs during the game itself. But, the main idea of the game was brought out which was important: how the ship got the way it is. Even though it follows a girl that has nothing to do with Isaac, everything that goes on around her explains how the people got the way they were and the events that took place prior to the game.
 So in conclusion, I thought it was a very exceptional movie which was a good set up to the game that you get to play.",1245888000,,647,3.976923076923077

Humans in outer space discovering a sculpture that turns them into cannibal mutants, sounds familiar and boring, but thankfully the makers of this film raised the goreometer level and concentrated on the surviving side of the story, leaving the explanation to be discovered in the video game, which by the way is great.

Yes the animation isn't that good looking, but the editing and the gore scenes are well made, I ended up saying to myself ""what the hell is going on?"" When some killing scenes didn't stop.  Watch out for the nearly headless woman and the needle.

The DVD extras are one deleted story board scene, movei and game trailers, photo gallery and an isolated soundtrack. There are also trailers of some B horror movies. Nice touch with the cover, it shows a severed left arm, the game has a severed right arm.",1244160000,,972,4.767857142857143

Sadly though, it ranked up there with many of the Saturday morning cartoons, with the addition of gore.  Its use of cgi didn't help, mainly because of the poor art work; the cgi didn't blend well where it complimented the movie.

When it comes to fear factor...there wasn't any.  Maybe because it's a cartoon.  I have yet to see a cartoon horror movie that is actually scary.  Live action horror movies use lighting and mood, which can't be reproduced in a cartoon.  At least not well.  Despite the use of props, when you see a live action horror movie, you close your eyes because it looks real.  It's the cheap, low budget movies where you can tell it's all props, which you want to either laugh or make fun of it.  Going live action would have made this movie a little scarier.

Anyone concerned with nudity or looking for it, there isn't any other the scene in the showers, where people are being attacked.  In that segment, you're only going to see nude men, one in particular where you see a guy's ""equipment.""  There are no nude women scenes or sex scenes, which is common with the anime genera.

One pathetic aspect of the movie is that the person putting the story together and/or the director, took ideas from different movies and tries to make it work in this piece.  Many times when a writer or director puts details here and there, it makes a symmetrical arch later in the movie.  With Dead Space, you can see small elements from other horror movies but doesn't make those small elements work because they don't fully use the components to its full extent.

Take for example the end of the movie.  Before it goes to credits, you hear a child's limerick.  The child's limerick doesn't fit any where because you don't have any earlier segments where they utilize aspects of the child's limerick.  You don't see any of the character's childhood where the song is sung, or even anyone communicating with a parent where it makes some sense to include that in this movie.  Furthermore, having the limerick doesn't do anything to enhance fear.

There are portions of the movie where you see what's going on from the monster's point of view.

Granted fans of the game probably have read it already but for a movie, it would have been nice to have included it.  Having scenes of life on Earth would have also been interesting.

As far as the DVD itself, in the special features section, you can hear a soundtrack.  Now if you're thinking a song being sung, you'd be wrong.  It's the background orchestra music that's played in the movie.  I'd only recommend listening to it if you enjoy what you hear in the movie.  When the music is played, your screen goes blank so there's nothing going on other then music.  The DVD also has deleted scenes, which for a cartoon; it's not that interesting to watch since all you're seeing is sketches, with actors reading their lines.  You also have the movie trailer for Dead Space: Downfall.

Surprisingly, the best part of the DVD is the art of Dead Space segment.  A majority of the artwork is from the game and it is beautifully done.  There are only about 4 pieces of work for the movie that is shown and that's set toward the end of the gallery.  Another aspect of Dead Space, that happens to be good, is the trailer for the game.  These two parts of the DVD are the only thing that's of any redeeming value.  Everything else, from the trailers to soundtrack is worthless.

All in all this was a very entertaining movie.  NOTE:  Keep children OUT of the room!!!  Very gorey and not for the squeamish (same goes for the game).",1233273600,,422,4.085365853658536
3421149,2,B0018TAFQ6,"Dead Space the game looks great and so forth. Going to play it soon and am looking forward to it. Before playing the video game I wanted to watch this anime (cartoon) before playing so I can get some preface to the game.

Storyline (2/5)

Without spoiling any part of the story, or going into it, there were still much holes in the story line. You'll know when you watch that you are left with more questions, as they were never addressed in the anime (cartoon) itself.

Graphics (3/5)

Some of the layout looked cool, but the character detail is lacking. Looks simple. Even during the gore and blood, there isn't much detail in that, even (homage to Snagglepuss).

Dialogue (3/5)

Yes, I do not consider dialogue the same as storyline. Dialogue would be he presentation of the storyline, which is good at times and not so good at another. Empty dialogue can be a bit of a bore and certainly needs more depth, which I can't be without spoiling the anime.

Sound/Music  (3/5)

Not bad. Pretty good. Needed more splat sounds for *certain* occasions. Music can drown the dialogue a bit at times, which I consider neglect on their part.

Overall (2/5)

Overall is not average of all the scores together, but the anime as a whole. I was really expecting much from this. Maybe I am disappointed is the reason for scoring so low, but there was so much hype already. The anime doesn't bring the game ANY justice. So, if you've seen this, please do not base Dead Space (game).

Feel free to comment or query if needed, without spoiling anything about the anime.

Thanks for reading. I tried to keep this review short and brief.",1233273600,,1618,4.557093425605537
3421150,4,B0018TAFQ6,"There were a few direct-to-video movies in the late 00's that were done as vehicles for a popular video game, usually for an upcoming release. Some of which like Halo and Mass Effect got turned into an actual anime. Dead Space: Downfall was produced as lead in to the first video game, and one of the first titles to begin this trend. Directed by Chuck Patton who also worked on the Spawn cartoon, this was developed by Film Roman, and the games creators, Electronic Arts.

 Set centuries from now, mankind is under a new religion called Unitology after an alien artifact was located on Earth. Sometime later, a similar one known as the Marker(called the ""Red Marker"" in game canon)is found on another planet, so the the Unitology church sends a ship to bring it back to Earth. A comic book mini-series released prior to this showed how the space colony where the Marker was bring kept slowly descended into madness. The Ishimura starship shows up and takes possession of the Marker, but unleashes a mad plague upon the crew where the start turning into mutated space zombies called Necromorphs. Everyone on board eventually gets killed by the Necromorphs, or from each other's madness. The last survivor is the movies main heroine Alissa who is the head of security. She manages to send a special warning on a beacon into space, but along with herself dying of asphyxiation. This ends with the first games hero boarding the Ishimura.

Downfall works as a fairly good sci-fi horror movie in its own right, without having to have been exposed to any other Dead Space media. It does has some pretty good animation, and doesn't hold back on the gore. There's some good performances by voice actors like Jim Cummings, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Bruce Boxleitner, especially in the scenes highlighting the crew's fall into insanity. It's as good as we're probably going to get to an animated version of Aliens, so give it a watch.",1232841600,,1928,4.783783783783784

I know I raved about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BioShock/dp/B001B1W3GG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BioShock</a>, and I think my raves were warranted.

I guess that I didn't completely remember how exhilarated and immersed I was in RE4, because I started Dead Space this past weekend, and I never felt like I was going to have a heart attack playing Bioshock like I did in Dead Space.

The first affect was when I stomped on something. I never thought that a silly controller vibration could add much to the gaming experience....but don't knock it til ya try it certainly applies here.

Gotta say, I'm not sure that watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Space-Downfall/dp/B001C0NMXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Space: Downfall</a>&nbsp;first was such a great idea.

3421154,1,B0018TAFQ6,"I just saw this.  Actually, I saw it a long time ago and in several better movies.  It wasn't scary, it just kept going on and on with 2-dimensional boring characters and one scene after another where they kept working as hard as possible to broadcast that every move they made was going to be the absolute worst move possible.

There was one moment when I thought there might be a character forming with more motivation than ""I have to go from point A to B"" but that was quickly dashed as he got killed in the same scene.

It just plodded... one step at a time till I was just waiting for the end.

The end of the movie, the actions that were taken, I just want to throttle whoever wrote that and tried to pass it off as making a bit of sense.

I think what people need to understand on the failure with this is just because you get your built-in anime and video game audience doesn't mean you can neglect story, motivation, clone every single character to every other character or bypass any sort of reason just to push your product out by its deadline.

This movie is essentially a prequel for a cross-platform critically acclaimed video game.  Unfortunately the talent used in making the game was not part of this animated movie project.  While the plot could have been good, its execution was horrendous, making it painful to watch.  Gore and foul language are over-the-top, it is as if the producers wanted to make sure this was an ""adult"" film.  If characters are going to curse, they should do so in a grammatically contextually correct way.  Guts strewn across the floor, blood on walls, blood dripping through the air, skulls torn open...gore for gore's sake does not automatically translate to horror and when its animated is seems silly.

3421171,5,B0018TAFQ6,"Having watched the six animated comic issues, (available online at [...] or various other sites), and being drawn into the Dead Space universe there, my interest in the game skyrocketed. It had only moderately caught my eye until I learned that there was free content to explore. After watching the comics, and realizing that this game was going to be right up my alley, (a strongly narrative driven, dark as hell sci-fi horror action romp) I was ecstatic to learn that there was to be an animated movie accompanying the release. I picked up the game on its release and it was exactly what I expected from watching the comics, pure awesomeness. My interest was so piqued at this point I picked up the movie along with it.

My review comes from the standpoint of someone who has watched the comics, played the game, and seen the movie. In my opinion, all three medias are f***ing awesome, and seeing the comics first is absolutely necessary to getting the full experience out of the story. After having the background information from the comics, the story of Downfall seems much more complete, and having watched those two, the game itself is much more enjoyable.

As far as the film goes, as a standalone it would seem perhaps a little weak, but when combined with the other two elements, this is a fantastic experience all around. I highly recommend all three.

I particularly love the voice acting of all three medias. The male and female leads, the doctor, and the colony manager in the comics are great, and Captain Matthias in Downfall stand out for me. I am a big fan of the animation of Downfall, I have no complaints, and the stylistic approach to the comics works very well in my opinion.

If you're a sci-fi/horror fan, do yourself a favor and check out all three medias of this superb universe.",1226880000,,1806,4.652037617554859
3421172,2,B0018TAFQ6,"Downfall is supposed to be the prequel to the Dead Space video game that was released prior to the video. There was a series of preview comics that were downloadable off the XBox marketplace that, and I assumed that the movie was going to be a base for the movie. However, this was not the case.

Ther movie primarily follows the Chief of Security of the Ishimura, who tries to contain the outbreak of violence and the necromorphs on the mining ship. The sequence follows a predictable path of disbelief, followed by a dug-in resistance. Several scenes are badly handled. Namely, a officer sees his own wife decapitate herself, and reacts as if she dropped a carton of eggs on the carpet. The ending is very dark and in line with the games tone. That was probably the only scene that reminded me of the Dead Space game.

Downfall was written and produced by someone who was told the plot of the video game, and maybe saw it played, but had no opportunity to play it themselves, and also had only cliff notes on the backstory. None of the scenes from the movie that appeared in game are remotely similar, and were well done in the video game, so it was disappointing to see them mess with it. None of the weapons of equipment from the game even makes an appearance, though one that does show up prominently, I wish had been in the game.

If the movie had had another title, it would've crawled up to 3 stars, as I wasn't a fan of the srtwork, but the name Dead Space raised expectations, which weren't met on almost every front.",1226707200,21,1527,4.427046263345196
3421173,3,B0018TAFQ6,"Leave it to Electronic Arts to find ways of making money. Recently, they've been doing grand things with new IPs, what with Mirror's Edge and Dead Space. But, even then, they're constantly thinking of the bottom dollar. Cross platform has been a buzz term recently, as a way of maximizing the profits of their newly crafted IPs. Which brings me to Dead Space. Dead Space is already, technically, a trilogy. Sure you have the game, but there's also a comic book detailing what happened on the mining colony where a mysterious artifact was found. Then there's Downfall, this animated movie that bridges the gap between the two stories.

Downfall begins with the discovery of The Marker, an artifact that the religious movement in Dead Space called Unitology, and its removal and transportation to the Ishimura. Very quickly things start to spiral out of control and, without getting into the details, the necromorphs that inhabited and destroyed the colony inadvertently end up on the Ishimura. From this moment on, it's up to head of security Alissa Vincent and her ragtag team of stereotypes to figure out what the hell is going on and...well, I guess it's not a spoiler to say they don't stop it since if they did, we wouldn't have Dead Space, the game.

Honestly, Downfall is about 90% action, 5% filler and 5% story which isn't a bad thing. It's actually a pretty entertaining romp, albeit a generic one that, like the game, steals a lot from other better films. One big problem I had, though, was that I was expecting a bit more connectivity between this and the game. I purposefully waited to watch the film for fear that it would ruin something from the game. Truthfully, though, there's not really much connection. The only link is that of Doctor Kyne and he, in fact, shares a scene in both the game and the movie. Unfortunately, it isn't the exact same scene, which completely ruins the continuity.

It makes for an entertaining stand-alone popcorn flick to people unfamiliar with the game and fleshes out the story for fans of the game somewhat by showing the events leading up to the nerve-wracking experience of the game in greater detail.

 Whether or not you play video games, if you love animated violence then this is as brutal as it gets.  The story involves a mining vessel sent by the fanatical Church of Unitology (Unitarian Scientologists?) to retrieve an artifact on a dead planet. The mining vessels subsist by ""cracking"" planets and selling the ore.  Some say this is detrimental to the harmony of the Universe.  I'd say that in this case, that's an understatement.  The vessel unwittingly unleashes an alien race -named as ""Necromorphs"" in the game- that thrive on dead flesh; possessing, reanimating, molding, and mutating it into forms suitable for slaying even more living things to continually spread the race.  The result is damn horrific by any standard.  To make things worse something is affecting the minds of the crew and driving them mad, making them both eager to die and kill for the aliens.  Mix this with an already fanatical religious sect and you've got trouble.

So other than a typical sci-fi alien/zombie invasion romp, some of the usual ""organized religion will kill us all"" gloom and doom, and a little extra story for gamers what does ""Downfall"" offer?  Violence.  Brutal, inhuman, senseless, bloody, evil, unrelenting, unflinching violence.  Decapitation, dismemberment, jaws ripped off, folks sawed in half (both horizontally and vertically), eyeball socket abuse, gaping neck wounds, viscera aplenty, and a freakin' mutated dead baby biting a dude in the face.  Now that is some hardcore sh!+.  The inside of the ship is practically painted in blood, and there's even a bit o' animated full frontal male nudity if that sort of thing piques your interest.  So yeah, you may want to send the kids into the next room for this one.  The violence in this is awesome.  Also be prepared for almost comically excessive profanity.

So with all the attention showered on the putrid piles of dung that are what usually passes for video game adaptations, why has nobody heard of this?  The likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uwe-Boll/dp/B000EQ5V8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uwe Boll</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul-Anderson/dp/B001GUYB08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul Anderson</a>&nbsp;get notoriety and praise (respectively) for ruining unruinable concepts and franchises while a solid flick like this gets shoved to the back of the shelf?  Double-you. Tea. Eff.  To be fair, ""Downfall"" isn't exactly all it could have been either.  The video game not only looks better visually, but is far more fleshed out storywise.  This film does very little to offer insight into the Necromorphs and few varieties even make appearances.  I was hoping for a lot more.  Practically none of the game's weapons are present either which is odd considering how cool they are and that the game takes place on the exact same ship which has no shortage of said weapons.  At least one character does manage to make their way to the video game, which picks up at the last scene of ""Downfall"".

Gorehounds, adult animation fanatics, sci-fi horror buffs, and video game aficionados are all going to want to see this.  It doesn't offer much more than brutal death, but it offers a whole lot of that.  I wish it had been done in CG to retain more of the game's amazing look and feel and that the story had encompassed more... well, story but this is definitely an entertaining hour and fifteen minutes.  The special features are sparse.  Hopefully more video game adaptations will stick to the animated format which has produced solid if not exceptional films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Street-Fighter/dp/B000FA57T4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Street Fighter</a>&nbsp;(compare that to the laughable live-action version) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-VII-Advent-Children/dp/B000AMJG4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children</a>.

3421176,5,B0018TAFQ6,"I don't think guys like Adam Stapleton paint a real picture here. This movie gives a great backstory and explains motives and actions of all the main characters of the game, except for maybe Dr. Mercer. I enjoyed it a lot and recommend for buying if you really enjoyed the game.",1226448000,,278,4.470588235294118
3421177,5,B0018TAFQ6,"My biggest concern with any sort of video game adaptation is that it will come off as a required element of the video game or vise versa.  This movie is the exact opposite of this fear and that is what makes it great!!  I like the way the movie explored the subtle things in the game without burdening the viewer with feeling like they were playing the game again.  The writers, Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray, paced the story well and make the characters actually interact and feel real despite the animation.  I'm glad I picked up this movie.",1226448000,,545,4.474747474747475
3421178,2,B0018TAFQ6,"As a prequel to a video game it works fine, as a piece of entertainment on its own? No. The animation is nicely drawn but very poorly animated. There is no story beyond ""monster in a box"" and nothing is explained. I guess they leave that for the game.",1226361600,,251,4.142857142857143
3421179,4,B0018TAFQ6,"For those of you who aren't aware, there's significant story arcs precluding the Dead Space game. They come in the form of animated comics released an ""issue"" at a time on both XBL and PSN. These are free downloads and even if you don't purchase Downfall, I strongly recommend downloading the comic series.

Downfall takes place in the space between the animated comics and the game. It's a decent story about how a seemingly routine ""planet crack"" goes awry when a ""marker"" is found on the planet being excavated. There's a nice story here but I don't think it's absolutely necessary to watch to fully enjoy the game. I feel that although the animation was well done and the gore was on par with the game, the story just wasn't creepy or deep enough to really make it a hit.

The creepiness in the animated comics was largely lost in the feature film. Don't get me wrong, it's no Disney movie, I just don't think it was quite on par with its predecessor. Unfortunately, it seemed like one of the major climax/action sequences exists only in the deleted scenes and even then it only exists as an animatic (meaning a series of uncolored rough sketches displayed in succession with audio tracks overlayed, for those unfamiliar with the term.)

Finally I wasn't really impressed with the quality of the blu-ray format. There's some extras in the BluRay live section that I imagine don't exist in DVD form, but I still don't think that the Blu-Ray version is worth the extra $5. The promised cheat codes exist as easter eggs within the movie. Not a big deal for me, but just wanted to give a heads up to those who expect a card with codes listed on it when they open their case.

Honestly, it's not a bad movie by any means. I just think they could've pushed the creepiness a little more as well as putting higher highs and lower lows in the story arc. If you're really psyched about the franchise it's worth getting (again, I'd grab the DVD version and save your five dollars.) If you're on the fence, you may want to rent or borrow it first. If you have no intention of playing the game and are just looking for a good horror anime, I would look elsewhere.",1226275200,10,2154,4.501278772378517
3421180,3,B0018TAFQ6,"Here's a fairly entertaining but also relatively minor sci-fi & horror direct-to-DVD feature. This film is not computer animation (or CGI) like the game, but rather traditional animation.  The film story (like the game) mostly consists of scenes of the uninfected crew members of a spacecraft fighting the zombified former crew, who are infected by some sort of alien life form after they die.  There is not much of a plot beyond this mild ""Alien"" ripoff, and that's one of my main problems with this DVD.  There are many story elements that are introduced briefly but never explained, such as the nature of the ""Unitology"" religion and an associated conspiracy back on Earth, or the fact that the alien artifact is one of three ""markers,"" the other two previously found.  More importantly, what is the connection between the humans who go homicidally crazy (caused by the artifact?) and those who change to alien zombies after infection?  Ultimately these plot limitations prevent the movie from achieving anything more than game tie-in status.  One other note:  the parental warnings on this DVD are well earned, with a lot of cussing and some graphic violence (albeit cartoon violence).",1226188800,4,1189,5.066666666666666
3421181,3,B0018TAFQ6,"Dead Space: Downfall serves its purpose as being a decent animated prelude to EA's great space based survival horror video game, delivering the goods in terms of blood and gore.  However, there's little else to be found than that here, and that may be absolutely fine with you.  The story revolves around the uncovering of an ancient artifact, and the events that transpire afterwards that involve people going insane and murdering one another.  Before you know it, there's mutated zombie beasts running amok, and no one is safe.  What Dead Space: Downfall does manage to accomplish is explain some plot points from the video game, as well as set-up what to expect if you haven't played it yet.  Other than provide ample amounts of bloody, gorey violence, the animation itself is pretty lackluster, and it doesn't look much better or sharper on Blu-Ray either.  Things aren't really helped much thanks to some atrocious dialogue and a cliche script from the comic book writing tandem of Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray (whose work has ranged from great to awful) that becomes hard to follow in the midst of all the violence.  Still, Dead Space: Downfall has a great music score, some genuinely creppy moments, and decent voice talent that includes Bruce Boxleitner and Kelly Hu.  All in all, Dead Space: Downfall serves as being a decent animated prelude to EA's great game, and for fans who have played it already or are looking to, this animated dirge is worth a look.",1226016000,2,1470,4.852
