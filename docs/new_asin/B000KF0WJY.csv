8156187,5,B000KF0WJY,"Tim O'Brien and Hot Rize  (named like many old country bands, after a flour company) are virtuosos of classic bluegrass. A great bonus on this DVD is a performance by Hot Rize's intelligently-tongue-in-cheek alter egos ""Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers,"" who manage to simultaneously celebrate and  poke fun at classic country music.  What a hoot when ""Red"" (Tim O'Brien) tells an interviewer that some day he hopes to have a Bluegrass group traveling in his bus, instead of having to travel around in the shadows of Hot Rize.  This is what bluegrass is supposed to sound like, and the humor of Red Knuckles & the boys rounds out a great package.",1374796800,,647,4.801801801801802

These guys were great musicians!  The musical performance make up for the lack of funny stuff.  This for me this is worth the price of the DVD.

Comedy: D
The ""Red Knuckles & the Trailblazers"" comedy is really not there.  'Red Remembers the 60s' is even lackluster.  There is no funny choreography at all as we see on the Austin City Limits performance earlier that year.  Very disappointing.  The funniest part is Slade doing a bass solo in a song by just thumbing between the A and E strings.

Video Quality: C-
It is washed out color-wise.  I was a little surprised considering this is an official release.

The Hot Rize songs are all great as well as the little talking parts in between.  That makes it not regretting this purchase.",1320796800,,746,4.533834586466165
8156189,5,B000KF0WJY,I always kind of liked Hot Rize but after seeing this DVD I now LOVE Hot Rize. It is really good. I never understood what Red Knuckles was but that part of the DVD was great. I highly recommend this to any bluegrass or music lover. Real good!,1202428800,2,242,4.0625
