1669981,4,B00005V4YF,"This is a story about love, but not a love story, as Angelina Jolie's character says in the movie. It is dark and takes somewhat unreasonable twists. I was not that thrilled about the camera work. I think the movie was made by the same director who made ""Gia,"" but in this case some scenes made my head spin because of the merry-go-round approach of the director. The camera simply twirled a bit too much. I liked Angelia Jolie's performance a lot and wish the critics would get off her back. However, this film feels a little like three films spliced together. The first is a story of a mail-order bride who may not be who she says she is. The second is a stroy of love and (mis)trust. And the third is a dramatic finale. I feel that each of these parts is somehow autonomous and does not need the others to entertain or make a point. I am not sure whose fault this is. I liked the end of this movie, even though as some reviewers have pointed out, it does not quite fit into the atmosphere of the rest of the picture. But perhaps this is the point--love outlives betrayal, obsession, financial catastrophy, and other disasters. Finally, it is possible that this Angelin Jolie's movie is partly autobiographical.

1669982,3,B00005V4YF,"'Original Sin' is a rather well-done film. It has moments of bland dialogue, the sex scenes are a tad corny (because they try so hard to be passionate), but all in all, for other reasons, it is quite a twisting and turning little erotic thriller.
  Antonio Banderas stars as Luis, and Angelina Jolie (looking exceptionally beautiful here) stars as Julia Russell. Luis is a coffee plantation owner, and is in need of a wife who is ""young"" and can ""bear his children"". The movie takes place some 100 years in the past, down in South America, so this somewhat crude need of his is acceptable. Julia is the American woman who has traveled down to meet him and to become his wife. They have only seen pictures of one another. Upon her arrival, Julia does not match her picture, and admits to having sent a false photo, so as not to be involved with a man who ""only desires a pretty face."" Luis admits to his own fib - he had told her through correspondence that he *worked* at the plantation, not that he *owned* it, so as to ward-off any prospective gold diggers. These deceptions only begin to reveal the lies and twisted desires that are to come later in the film. It really does interest you, keeping you on your toes, even if some of the ""surprises"" are somewhat easy to see coming.
  The acting in 'Original Sin' really hits the mark. Antonio Banderas is fine as the subtle and sympathetic Luis. Angelina Jolie continues to grow into a sturdy and mature actress. Thomas Jane, who plays a sinister private detective, also shines in his performance. The locales (including two cities in Cuba during Carnival season) make for rich scenery, and the story does take quite a few turns, always making it engaging. The directing is also interesting, as it makes good use of inventive quick-cut edits. There is quite a bit of eroticism and nudity, as this is most definitely an adult film (R rating).
  The ending of 'Original Sin' was, I thought, a little weak, but it still wasn't enough to detract from its overall strength. The story is adapted from a novel by famed author Cornell Woolrich (whom Alfred Hitchcock loved), thus a trusty blueprint was there to start with. The story isn't really all that spectacular - many ""thrillers"" have come before it where the plot twists, characters are not revealing the entire truth, and there's always a sap to feel sympathy toward. But it is the even-handed directing, wonderful backdrop, and top-notch acting which makes 'Original Sin' rise above the others.",996969600,11,2497,4.689497716894977
1669983,2,B00005V4YF,"the only good point about this movie is the physical beauty of the main actors. there were some steamy love scenes between Jolie and Banderas but other than that the movie is full of unnecessary violence, nudity, and sex. As a love story, the movie doesn't deliver until the final 5 minutes, but overall the movie's simply too slow. The plot, scenery, and acting in itself might deserve more than 2 stars, but coming from two fine actors this movie is simply a disappointment.",996796800,6,476,4.678571428571429
1669984,4,B00005V4YF,"I loved this picture! In Germany it opened a week after ""Tomb Raider"" (so Angelina Jolie was one of the reasons I went to see it), and because it was praised as a love story, I took my girlfriend - and she also loved it! Jolie (more beautiful than ever in those costumes), Banderas and Thomas Jane (""Thursday"") did a good job in their roles, but mostly the erotic and morbid atmosphere of Havanna during carneval was what made the movie so pleasent to watch. The story-twists were good, it was exelently shot - only the ending was a bit of a disapointment, simply because the director chose to lighten up the dark theme of the movie with a happy ending, which doesn't really fit into the flow. To sum it all up: This is not popcorn-cinema! It's a dark love story with great atmosphere! I fully recomend it, although it isn't a movie for all audiences...",995155200,133,853,4.439490445859873

I was flipping through movies on Amazon and saw this and was immediately intrigued with the story line. If you are looking for a movie about passion this is it. It's insane. I also love Angelina Jolie but didn't quite like her for this story line, it still worked though. She is gorgeous of course, but I think sometimes it can be a little distracting. I don't know how to explain it, I know that movies sell when they have really sexy women in it but Im not sure why her acting bothers me. Its still a good story, its kind of not what you'd expect. And the whole time your like ""nooo"" but also ""yess"" and it made me go on an Antonio Banderas marathon after I watched it. Its worth it alone to see him be romantically dreamy for two hours.",1449446400,4,814,4.2243589743589745

1670119,3,B00005V4YF,"Original Sin is an erotic thriller based on the novel,Waltz into Darkness by Cornell Woolrich. Also,it is a remake of Mississippi Mermaid. Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas stars in it. Michael Cristofer directs.

Luis Durand,portrayed by Antonio Banderas, is an 18th century coffee merchant whose supposedly plain mail-order bride turns out to be a sexy bombshell American Julia Russell,played by Angelina Jolie. Handsome and rich,Luis has never married. His expectations for the bride are realistic:kind,true and young enough to bear children. She does not have to be beautiful. But obviously,she sent the wrong photo. She sent someone who is of a plain woman. But she is far from that for she happens to be sultry and beautiful. She confesses she sent the wrong photo because she did not want a man who was attracted only to her beauty. He confesses, too: He owns his plantation and is not simply a worker there. He didn't want to attract a gold-digger.

Then,both get married. At first,they seem happy. He is so smitten that he allows her access to all of his considerable financial resources. But the happiness ends when Julia vanishes in possession of her husband's money. He sets off in pursuit, although whether to kill her or to win her back, not even he can say.

Too bad that the movie is contrived. Also,what's worse,it started to become illogical and absurd as the story progresses. Later,we learn a lot of the information from Julia herself who is in jail and being prepared for execution. Soon after Julia's disappearance, we learn she is not actually Julia at all, and that the real Julia was murdered. And many more plot twist until it provides the audience an ending where everything is turned around and it ends up cheating the audience.

The acting was great in the early scenes for Banderas and Jolie have great chemistry but once Julia's loyalties are brought into question repeatedly, this chemistry is sacrificed for the story. Indeed,both the characters that they have played have become machinations for the plot.

The only good thing about it is that it is high on lust as there are a lot of sensual and sex scenes between Jolie and Banderas that the audience would surely enjoy. But nothing more.",1433721600,,2226,4.893899204244032

Original Sin takes place in Cuba, but I suspect that it was filmed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which has a fort and waterfront very much like that of Havana. With the relations between the US and Cuba warmimg up, it is likely that we will see American movies filmed entirely in Cuba, hopefully without the presence of the Miami Mafia, which ran the country during Batista's reign. It would be great to have a film about Ernest Hemingway, who was one of Havana's most famous residents, with Angelina Jolie as his Cuban girlfriend (I'd like to hear her speaking Spanish). With Cuban workers making only the equivalent of 30 dollars per year, the economy could use a stimulus.",1366416000,,745,4.694656488549619

1670270,5,B00005V4YF,"This is a story about love,  as Bonny Castle would say.  It's a story about a man and a woman from two different worlds,  who come together in marriage,  and find out what it really means to be one.

Some would say this is a movie about a con artist who screwed her husband over.  A con artist who was unworthy of the man she married.  They might say she made her husband look like a fool.  But truly,  it is the con artist who is the fool,  who managed to con herself into believing she could be nothing but the lowest of the low, even when the best was given to her.

In both characters we see what could be seen as unconventional,  cynical standards.  Luis expected a homely, simple wife,  not even expecting love.  Bonny expected money,  not expecting a husband that would accept her for all her flaws and help her fight her demons.  The moral of this story could perhaps be that if a couple is willing,  they can overcome obstacles in their lives and grow by marriage.  But of course,  there are always con artists in the real world who are just evil and cannot be helped.

I would go as far as to say that Billy is the movie's evil.  Billy offers everyone help, at a price.  He does not advise on what is best for everyone,  but what is essentially best for him.  He uses Luis in every way but makes himself out to be a friendly ally.  He does all he can to keep Bonny within her own limitations,  which really just become the limitations set by Billy.  The scratches almost like a marking on her very soul, as if to say her soul is his.

Rounding up,  I'll give this a 5 star review.  I almost gave it 4 stars because the casing did not have any of those inserts that I like to read and look at.  Bought this for around $9,  which is excellent for a blue-ray price.  I wanted this on Instant Video but Amazon does not appear to have it.",1361491200,2,1843,4.127478753541077

It goes beyond that,It is historically Inaccurate Cuba does not Look Like Mexico and Several other but typical of Movies and Hollywood and popular mindset in General about Cuba.

1670277,5,B00005V4YF,"I love this movie. I don't care how far fetched the plot is or how melodramatic the movie is. I found everything that makes me enjoy watching a movie right here. And yes seeing Angelina in her Lara Croft toned bod in the buff was the icing on this sinfully delicious devils food cake.
  In short, Original Sin is a romantic thriller. Set in the late 1800s, a wealthy Cuban merchant (Banderas) has sent off for a mail ordered bride who turns out not be the plain looking woman in the picture but a  ravishing beauty (Jolie). But beneath her beauty and wanton sexuality lies a truely dangerous heart.
  I won't go any further storywise except to say that this movie does go pretty far off in left field. I mean, how many times does a woman have to try and kill you before you say ""Enough!""? And yes there are lots of graphic sexuality shown; lots of close ups on limbs innertwined, lots of thrusting, and heavy on the moaning and the panting. Remember this version was released back when you could actually tell what scenes were re-instated instead of just a desperate marketing ploy to try and sell a cruddy movie that bombed in its theatrical run. But, for what its worth, the movie does entertain for its two hour span and even now, eleven years after purchasing it, I never grow bored while watching it. I guess the real moral of the story is if you order a bride off the Internet or from a catalogue and someone who looks like Angelina Jolie shows up, its probably better to Return To Sender.",1332460800,,1495,4.421818181818182

Antonio Bandaras's character is so dumb that even after Angelina's character has played him over and over, he still comes back to her. One part of the movie especially annoyed me, and that was the scene where he is having a poker game and Angelina is giving him hand signals to show what cards they have. Does anyone else think it is really stupid that they thought the men wouldn't notice she continually walks around the table over and over and over, and he keeps looking at her? Seriously that must have been one of the dumbest things I have ever seen. As far as the ending, really dumb, she is acting like she is playing both men throughout the whole movie and then all of a sudden she is in love with him.

It is also a visually sumptuous film, with some richly textured scenes. Ensure to select the unrated version. Her first words evoke the extremes of love; ""the power to heal, the power to destroy"". This is how the film proceeds. It is about deception. At one point the central male character is discussing love and lust with his best friend. ""What's the difference"" he asks.

1670309,4,B00005V4YF,"OK, OK, I know: implausible plot, unlikely twists and turns, and a lead male character whose IQ seems about the same as his shoe size (at least as far as love is concerned)--so why the 4 stars?  Easy, great cinematography, steamy scenes featuring Angelina Jolie (and Antonio Banderas for those with affinity toward males) naked, and a storyline that helps you escape reality for a couple of hours.

""Original Sin"" takes place in early 20th Century Cuba, where Banderas has arranged for marriage with a white woman from the mainland US.  However, when he sees her for the first time, he finds out she is not the down-home girl he was expecting, but rather a beautiful woman whom, despite his original intentions, he falls in love with.  Unfortunately, his wife, deviously played by Jolie, turns out to be looking for more than love.

As the situation steadily moves along, the plot weaves its way through several twists and turns that are interesting, even if slightly predictable.  While this movie is not in the same historical time, it has the feel of romantic drama/thriller flicks such as ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Guilty as Sin"" and/or ""Basic Instinct""...not in the same league as the first and last mentioned, but certainly worth a look.",1286496000,,1238,4.899521531100478

1670311,4,B00005V4YF,This movie is really a piece of work. It's like a boat ride leaving the beautiful scenes along the river course and being drawn towards a dark cave.

1670313,2,B00005V4YF,"Perhaps the training I received at UCLA in Theater Arts/Motion Pictures has ""spoiled"" me. A better word of course would be ""made me more discerning."" But then I also remember many of the old time films, directors, actors. I have to agree with the negative reviews this movie received. It is so amateurishly directed that I could not stand to view it all the way through but had to turn it off in disgust half the way through. The amateurish direction resulted in poor acting (though Banderas tried his best he was hamstrung by faulty direction). Of course a really good actor would shine through even the worst of films as John Barrymore did.

But as long as there is the glamor & glitz of Hollywood, fans will be mesmerized by the stars & will have no discernment as to what is poor & what is not.",1263686400,2,798,4.428571428571429
1670314,4,B00005V4YF,"Yes, this plot tends to derail the film in parts (I mean really, this is not a realistic film at all), but the performances, the stunning direction, the love scenes, the steamy chemistry and the art direction (those sets are glorious) make this a very rewarding and splendidly desirable movie to watch.  I like how some state this is `so bad it's good', but I really don't think it's `bad' at all.  It's sleek, sensual and provoking, not to mention gorgeous to look at.

The film centers around the whirlwind romance between a wealthy Cuban coffee plantation owner named Luis who sends away for a mail-order bride named Julia only to find that she is far from what he expected.  The two are obviously very attracted to one another and soon fall into love, or so it seems.  When Julia disappears with all of Luis's money, not to mention his heart, he sets out to find her and exact his revenge.  His journey leads him to find a world filled to the brim with intrigue, danger and romance.

The first half of the film is a stunning unraveling of love and lust, and Angelina Jolie's languid sensuality coupled with Antonia Banderas's fearlessness really elevates the scenes and creates something that feels beautiful yet almost dirty; tender yet dangerous.  The second half of the film starts strong, with wild splashes of color and deftly cultivated sequences of desire, but soon after the couple is reunited the sudden game of cat-and-mouse starts to delve into tediousness.  The ending to me was a cop-out (even if it's what you secretly are desiring) and it gave the film an almost camp like feeling (the way the character's seem to be toying with you is somewhat off putting in a `look we can be funny' kind of way).

It's that last quarter of the film that really drives a nail in the coffin for me.

As for the bulk of the film though, `Original Sin' really does it for me.  Jolie is a very spirited and competent performer.  The only fault that could be found her is that she does rest on her natural desirable qualities in a lot of her work (very reminiscent of Johansson in that regard) but when the script calls for it, how can you `fault' her.  The script definitely calls for it here, and she delivers.  You believe her, even when the dialog seems to be fighting against her (the fiery ""because I was falling in love with my husband!"" scene is a bit contrived, but she makes it work somehow).  Banderas doesn't fare as well as Jolie, but he goes for it.  I've always enjoyed him, but I've always found his acting a bit awkward.  I think it's the way he speaks for me.  I love when foreign actors convert to English films (I love foreign actors, period) but some have trouble with the language and they speak in way that makes each word almost seem like a struggle.  Banderas gives me that vibe, thus making some of his dialog seem unconvincing.

For me, this biggest acting glitch is Thomas Jane (who ruins a lot of the second half for me as well) and honestly feel if the part had been recast the film would have worked much better in the end, but then again, the character was pretty horrible to begin with.

So, watch the movie.  It is not as bad as some claim it to be, and even when it falls short it makes up for it in other areas.  Some say this is a skin flick (the unrated version certainly straddles the fence of `adult entertainment') but there is more here than that.  The darkness attributed to the plot adds a layer to the film that takes it out of that lazy category and gives it a life of its own.",1258675200,3,3522,4.423255813953489

This is the story of a Cuban coffee farmer, Luis (Antonio Banderas) who asks to be brought from the USA, a woman so he can marry and have children. As he works too much, he has no time for knowing a woman the usual way. He becomes astonished when at the port, he looks at his future wife, a very beautiful woman called Julia (Angelina Jolie). The actors have a real chemistry, it can be seen whenever they look at each other and in the famous sensual scenes. Julia has a mysterious past and constant nightmares trouble her. The story becomes a bit confused as a letter is exchanged between Julia and her supposed sister. Then, we have the appearance of a weird detective, Walter Downs (Thomas Jane) and the subsequent Julia's disappearance. From that point on, Luis travels to Havana searching for his wife and his life turns upside down... I didn't like Angelina Jolie's character very much, her betrayal,even though you will see, her past follows her to the present and she cannot get rid of it.

They were beautiful together and sizzled the screen with their bedroom and tub love making. It was definatly an afternoon turn on to see these two great actors make love in such a realistic fashion it made me blush.

When Luis (Bandaras) meets his mail-order-bride Julia (Jolie) he is stunned at her beauty.  She is nothing like he expected, yet he marries her immediatly.  Luis is the perfect gentleman, and that makes Julia's next move even harder.  Once she has gained Luis' trust she leaves him, taking him for every cent.  Luis then, with the help of a P.I., decides he will find her, and kill her.  The problem is that he still loves her.  But does she love him?  This film shows the dark side of love, the side that allows you to love someone you don't even know, but can feel, someone you connect with, someone that makes you whole.  Jolie and Bandaras are spot on (especially with their clothes off...HOT HOT HOT) and they work wonders with this script.  I have watched this film over and over and still can't get enough of it.  The unrated version of this film offers a steamier and much more explicet love scene with movement and lots of nudity (no full frontal Bandaras shots though, you'll have to settle for quite a few butt shots) and it includes a few other sex scenes, less explicet, that were cut from the movie entirly.

1670367,1,B00005V4YF,"Antonio Banderas plays a rich coffee magnate who is so stupid you can't believe he ever got wealthy when he's running around giving money freely to a woman (Angelina Jolie) who lied to him from the moment they met.  She didn't want him to be blinded by a pretty girl, so she sent a photo of the girl he was actually supposed to marry.  Well, we never get to see the pretty girl, because Jolie must have killed her too.  The only reason this woman is ""hot"" is because she'll take her clothes off and have sex with anybody (if you've seen Gia, you'll know what I mean).  Neither she or Banderas (who isn't a very good actor either and seems intent on overembellishing his accent) have any chemistry, and you wonder what he keeps forgiving her for when he catches up to her.  My guess?  The age old weakness most straight guys have for bad girls in bed, and all the sex in this movie gets old fast.  It's so stupid, because nobody has interludes like that unless they're shooting a blue movie.  The only blue here is the shade you will turn by the boredom with the weak plot.

You can see right through this silly waste of two hours you'll never get back:  this adaptation from Waltz into Darkness was remade especially for the purpose of exploiting two celebrities with highly sensual images and nothing more.  This movie is as bad as Showgirls and one star less than Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, because at least Beyond is badly funny in an entertaining way.  Not only is their relationship devoid of any true sense of love, but you also get this overwhelming desire to see creepy, unconvincing Billy (played horribly by Thomas Jane) get the girl.  Billy?  What a stupid name for a bad guy, but I guess it wouldn't make a difference even if his name was Ralph or Percival.

Early on in the movie, the so-called beauty Julia/Bonnie/I forget what else--wants to see a really bad theater group, and a friend of theirs comments on what a cheap mellowdrama is being presented.  My thoughts about Original Sin exactly.  The plot is stupid, and the dialogue is so bad it's over the top.  In the end, the movie makes absolutely no sense, and you wish you would get a payoff, but you don't.  The rat poison doesn't do its job, and neither does the executioner.  All I really am sure of is that, with all the rape scenes that Jolie's horrible character seems to enjoy and her portrayal of a woman who's asking for it constantly, that women should find this movie grossly offensive and degrading to our gender, and I'm not even a feminist!  As for studmuffin Banderas?  He really has no business in front of a camera because his acting scope is on par with the little boy who was in Problem Child with John Ritter.  However, he is a good director (Crazy in Alabama).  Heed my advice and avoid Original Sin; the two hours you waste on it will be unforgivable.",1121558400,16,2849,4.445086705202312

Much to his surprise, the woman that steps off the ship is Jolie, a real babe.  There is an immediate attraction and soon they are married, having a great time with each other with lots of romantic scenes.  This is soon to end, however, when he discovers that she has deceived him.  The woman he was supposed to marry has disappeared.  And who, exactly is this beautiful creature who fate has brought to his door?  This is just the first half hour of the film, however, and from here on there are ups and downs and lots of deceptions.  The man is smitten and Jolie has him wrapped around her finger.  The plot thickens.

I've never thought much of Jolie as an actress.  That is why she is so perfect for this part.  She's supposed to play a ""bad"" actress, and the role calls for a lot of ""over-acting"".  This made me enjoy her performance.  And she also wears beautiful clothes and is a pleasure to look at.  Antonio Banderas is completely believable as the man who she makes jump through hoops.  But he doesn't really get much sympathy because he lets her do it to him.  And, in a funny way, it is Jolie who I wound up empathizing with.  She's cast as a survivor and it's a good role.

There is certainly too much melodrama in the production.  And the situations are just often just not believable.  And yet I enjoyed every bit of this film and wouldn't change a word.  .

After watching the movie, I bought the original book and read it.  It was quite different from the movie (as usual), with an extra character that is integral to the story.  The movie, as someone mentioned, AS USUAL, was ""Hollywood-esqued"" but still has a wonderful surprise ending.

I found the movie to be MORE intriguing than the book (for ONCE) with more twists to the plot.  And of course, Bandaras is nice to look at! hehehe...

Waiting until 2001 to turn this particular novel into an American movie starring Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie has a couple of interesting impacts (the book was filed as ""La Sirne du Mississipi"" by Francois Truffaut in 1969 with Jean-Paul Belmondo and Catherine Deneuve).  The first is that the unrated version of ""Original Sin"" available on DVD is able to have nude scenes featuring the two stars.  The second, and I was dare say more important difference, is that director Michael Cristofer, who also did the film's screenplay, released his film to an audience that was weaned on films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sting/dp/0783225873/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sting</a>"" and have had their suspicions raised to red level by ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Usual-Suspects/dp/B00005V9HH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Usual Suspects</a>"" and other films in that mode.

It is clear from the start that there are trust issues with this story.  Jolie first appears as a woman in prison who is facing execution by garroting in a particularly wicked looking chair.  She is telling her story to a priest (confession seems too strong a word to describe her narrative).  Our assumption is that she must have committed murder to deserve such a fate, and so the story begins.  Luis Vargas (Banderas) is the rich co-owner of a coffee plantation on Cuba around the previous turn of the century.  For reasons that would certainly belie the actor's good looks his character has sent away for a bride from the United States.  He shows her photograph to his friends; his intended is rather plain looking, but his goal is to find someone who is kind, true, and young enough to bear children.  Neither her being beautiful nor him being in love is part of the plan.

But then Julia Russell (Jolie) shows up and clearly has lied about her looks.  She does not want to wanted for her pretty face and it seems clear she has a past she is trying to get away from if not hide outright.  Luis confesses that he has lied as well, hiding the fact of his wealth.  This leads Julia to conclude that these two strangers who are about to be married in a few hour's time have at least one thing in common: ""Neither one of us can be trusted.""  Luis might not believe her, but we certainly do.  They marry and if there is not love between them the sex seems to be really great.  But then there are uneasy letters from Julia's sister and then an American private investigator, Walter Downs (Thomas Jane), arrives in Cuba, hired to find out what is really happening to Julia.

The good news is that no matter how suspicious you are about what is happening in this movie, you are never going to figure out the ending.  You might stumble on it, but it will be the result of blind luck rather than reasoned formulations.  There is an inherent ambiguity to both the characters and their actions, and if you told me that Cristofer had purposefully made sure all of the scenes could be read in opposite directions I would not be surprised.  At some point you will learn not to be surprised by what is happening and then it becomes a question of how far the momentum of the plot twists will take you.

However, the bad news is finding a character to root for as this game plays itself out.  Luis should be the obvious choice, but you can get weary trying to decide if he is in love or just trying to get revenge.  Besides, there is something pathetic about this rich and handsome man intending to buy himself a homely bride.  When he realizes he has been stupid and keeps on doing stupid things, Luis becomes an even more pathetic figure.  There is a limit as to how stupid the hero gets to be in a movie such as this one.  This story would work a lot better if the leading man were not so much more better looking than the leading woman.  But then when they look at each other each has the same reason to like what they see.  Still, the dynamic bothers me at times.

We are told that this is not a love story, but rather a story about love.  But that is no more of a trustworthy comment that anything else we hear in this film.  Ultimately, I come to the sad conclusion that the sex scenes were probably the best part of this film.  At the end, when all the twists are out in the open and I think back on what the final revelation means for every thing up to that point, I still cannot connect all of the dots and have it make sense.  It is like the payoff exists despite the setup and not because of it.  Or, to put it another way, the tricks of all the plot twists are not up to the treat of the sex scenes.  If that sounds like a good thing to you, then ""Original Sin"" might not be such a disappointment to you as it was to me.",1099008000,7,5386,4.997757847533633

The plot as i know has been taken from a novel that not many people bothered reading. The story is ok (as i said i wasn't exactly concentrating) and the only thing i remember about this movie is the Kama Sutra type poses by the lead pair. Hollywood will really need to do something about what it churns out.

The plot, the performances and the direction are really nothing to write home about. If you are having one of those evenings when you are feeling lazy to do anything and would wish Angelina was in bed with you, then go for it and freeze the Kama sutra poses.",1092096000,4,888,4.311377245508982

1670400,2,B00005V4YF,"WARNING: SOME VERY MILD SPOILERS*****
The first time I saw this, I was prepared to laugh at a sleazy, direct-to-video Harlequin novel-on-celluloid. What is it about Antonio Banderas? He's very handsome and not a bad actor, but he seems to choose a lot of really cheesy projects, ""Femme Fatale"" being a particularly awful one I recall watching.
But I thought this was a decently entertaining, if not brilliantly deep film. I was unaware at that time of it's provenance -- it's based on an excellent novel by Cornell Woolrich called ""Waltz into Darkness"". The book is well worth reading if you like this film. It was also made into a film in the mid-sixties by Francois Truffaut called (inexplicably ) ""Mississippi Mermaid"". Strange title, because the original novel is set in 1870s New Orleans and Julia travels to meet Louis on a steamer down the Mississipp BUT in the Truffaut film he reset the story in the 60s and the action of the film in colonial Africa and the French Riviera!
""Original Sin"" is, interesting, vastly closer to the novel than the Truffaut version. The setting is changed to Cuba, presumably to accodomodate Bandera's accent, but the period is correct and the story doesn't work well in modern times, so overall, I find ""Original Sin"" to be the better of the two movies -- and that's saying a lot, as Truffaut is revered as a brilliant director. (""Mississippi Mermaid"" is NOT by any means one of his better efforts, however.)
An early cautionary tale of ""personals ads"" and blind dating, the story seems even more relevant today than when it was written. Luis (Banderas) writes to a mail order bride, who is supposed to be plain, shy and religious. He is surprised when stunningly beautiful and sexy Julia (Angelina Jolie, of the collagen injected lips) shows up. Even though she betrays him and cheats on him and steals all his money...he still loves her. Both film versions clean up the ending -- I won't give the film ending away -- but in the book, Julia/Bonny actually kills Louis/Luis. A very bleak ending. Don't worry, the movie is a lot more fun.
The kind of film that falls under the heading of ""guilty pleasure"", ""Original Sin"" has lots of great costumes and sets and Banderas and Jolie are two of the sexiest people imaginable and we get to watch them getting hot and heavy. (BTW: the ""unrated version"" isn't really all that dirty...I don't get the rating thing. The sex isn't graphic or bizarre in any way -- it's two people who are MARRIED and making love. In the age of ""Sex in the City"", what the heck is the big deal?)
Anyways, call over your best girlfriends, microwave some popcorn and have a good time....",1088294400,,2644,4.688172043010753

1670402,3,B00005V4YF,"Unlike most flawed dramas, Original Sin is actually better in its second half, when some gripping plot twists occur. Antonio Bandaras makes his character three dimensional. Angelina Jolie is given less to work with, and we never quite understand her character but that doesn't take from her charm as the protagonist.
All that is fine and dandy, but something big is missing from the overall feel of the film. The color tone through out is semi-sepia, which gives it a tinge of brownish orange -- quite irritating if you know that the real Spain could have been spectacular on screen anyway! The camerawork is quaky at times, which I found rather distracting, and the same goes for the pieces of soft porn thrown in, replete with predictable and occasionally even corny dialogue.
Nonetheless, the movie progresses into a good plot, until an almost unprecedented fantastically dramatic ending. Which is great!
Problem? Even though the end had come, and gone, the movie went on. What should have been an awesome dramatic ending was lurched 180 around towards what can only be described as a Hollywoodesque denouement. As if somebody had quite literally glued that ending onto the movie after it was already finished. What could have been a solid 4.5 to 5, turned to a meagre 3 in the last 10 (unforgivable) minutes.

1670403,3,B00005V4YF,"I rented Orginial Sin knowing it would be a terrible movie. But it was actually a pretty good movie, an almost Hitchcockian film, almost as good as the Talented Mr. Ripley.

Sure, there's sex in it. You see a lot of Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas, as well as other people. But there's a story beneath all of it, and it's an intriguing movie even without the sex scenes. Jolie plays Jane Russell, who marries a Cuban coffee plantation owner named Luis Vargas through mail order--except only when they finally meet does he learn that she's beautiful and she learns that he is rich. However, Luis begins to discover that his bride has lied about more than her beauty, though he cannot stop loving her even as she deceives him.

Banderas and Jolie are very good actors, and are very convincing together. The sets and scenery of colonial Cuba are elegantly done, and the music is both atmospheric and sultry. But it's far from perfect. The supporting cast, both in characterization and acting, is quite bad. And the ending is improbable, though satisfying.

It's really not a bad film overall, which is the biggest shock of all. The salvation comes from Banderas's and Jolie's talented acting.",1074902400,,1193,4.781553398058253

When she arrives, he instantly falls in love with her.  At first, their relationship seems to be going along fine, but things begin to change.  His wife, Julia, runs away with all his money after he added her name to his account.  The rest of the movie follows Luis as he tries to find her again as he chases her across Cuba.  This movie isn't as bad as some people made it out to be although it isn't a great movie.  It is beautifully shot with plenty of fantastic settings and lush colors.

Thomas Jane is very good in a creepy role as Detective Walter Downs who is investigating something about Julia's past.

1670417,4,B00005V4YF,"How far would you go for love and how much would you sacrifice?  These are the central points in this story.  The film is a period piece, set in 19th century Cuba.  A time when men were chivalrous and women were, well, powerless...or so we would think.  Luis Vargas (Banderas) is a wealthy coffee merchant who sends away for a wife.  All he knows of his wife to be, is from her letters.  When he finally meets her, he is shocked and then mesmerized by Julia's (Jolie) beauty and her apparent sexuality.  They are wed on the day they meet and Luis's life, as he knows it, is never the same again.
This film could have easily turned into a cheap melodrama, were it not for the skill and smoldering sex appeal of Banderas and Jolie.  While the viewer must suspend some disbelief as the plot twists and turns (especially at the end), and while parts of the movie are predictable, the story somehow still remains intriguing and viable.

What I found was a wonderfully twisted plot that involves layer upon layer of deception. IF you pay attention to the narrator, you realize she's telling a story to a priest who's lead a very sheltered life-and she's telling the story for a reason.
Now I'll admit seeing Antonio Banderas naked (there's no full frontal nudity for either actor) can be distracting, but this is perhaps the most complexly woven plot I've run into in a long time. I'd be proud to have written this one. And while Angelina's naked ... don't do a thing for me, Antonio distracted me enough to have to watch it several times. To sort out the details of the plot. Yeah. That was it.
I have recommended this to several writers as a study guide on Erotic Romantic Suspense. It has all the best elements-a man you wish would love you that way-a woman you love to hate and then hate to love-and a plot you can never be sure of. And Luis is not too stupid to live. He's just in love. A sin we can easily forgive him for.

1670425,4,B00005V4YF,"This is a movie for the fans of the actors: Jolie and Banderas. I do think that Jolie lights up the screen throughout this film, even though she plays a dark character. The actors save this picture from being just another unremarkable B movie. Since I saw this movie in theaters in the Summer of 2001, I have changed my mind about directing and camera work. Originally, I felt that the fast-pace and seemingly aimless movement of the camera were making me dizzy, but when I saw this movie more recently on a big-screen TV, I realized that this style of directing gave the picture a much needed feeling of fast pace and change. Without this, and without Jolie, I suspect I would have been bored by the movie and would have fallen asleep before it was over.
Jolie is Bonnie Castle, an actress and a thief, who travels with an accomplice played, I believe, my her real world brother. They (or he) murder Julia, the woman who is supposed to become the wife of Louis, the character played by Banderas. Jolie's character Bonnie Castle takes Julia's place and disembarks in Cuba to meet her future husband. Well, Banderas meets Jolie. Both of them are dark. He is handsome. She is beautiful. He is not very much concerned that Angelina Jolie does not look like the picture of Julia. The are wedded the same day. He allows her ""time"" before they consummate their marriage. But it does not take too much time, and about 15 minutes into the film we have our first, and by far the most explicit, love scene.
I will not reveal the plot that follows. Suffice it to say that it is a bit unrealistic: a huge withdrawal from the bank without informing the cosigner (what kind of banking laws did they have in Cuba?); real bullets replaced by blanks, seamlessly and just in time; Jolie and Banderas gulping coffee at all hours like there was no tomorrow; the drinking of rat poison... Just takes your breath away, doesn't it? However, reminiscent of real life developments, a knife is being used to gently cut Angelina's flesh. And if that what some people are doing to themselves in reality, then is the plot of the movie really so far-fetched?
Ultimately, the message is clear: you can't get away from love. Or obsession, or stupidity, or lust. You just cannot get away. We are stuck in this world--the only world we've got, and the only world we know something about. I know that in this world it is good to have nice distractions, like this well-acted, even if a bit less than excellent film.",1052265600,7,2479,4.560538116591928

But there are always the occasional theatrical releases, such as Basic Instinct (great sex scenes, sporadically interesting story), Bound (steamy sex scenes, good plot, Jennifer Tilly is annoying as hell), Wild Things (dull sex scenes, fun plot twists), and Color of Night (ludicrous story, but features one of the best sex scenes in mainstream cinema!).  Original Sin can be added to the list, but it's easily the worst of this lot, giving us two stars who generate no heat and a story that isn't ridiculously convoluted enought to be trashy fun.  Really, this movie's all talk, without enough genuine passion, suspense, and not enough bare skin (and I saw the unrated version).
Antonio Banderas stars as an incredibly dumb coffee mill owner who's just been arranged to meet his mail-order bride.  He's written letters to her and has seen some pictures of her, but when he meets her face-to-face, she's nothing like he expects.  This bride turns out to be Angelina Jolie, whose sensuous looks and curves captivates our protagonist.  It seems she sent a different picture of herself so that a man won't be looking to marry her for her looks.  What a great, deceptive start to their marriage. Oh, yes, their marriage is bliss, as they continously make love and declare their love for one another.  But then it turns out she actually isn't his mail-order bride; she's taken all his money, leaving poor Banderas heart-broken and dead-set to find her.  Enter Thomas Jane, whose role is obvious from the start to any semi-keen viewer.
Original Sin is the kind of film that will probably have your eyes rolling from all the overdone dialogue (""Can't you see I cannot...LIVE without you?!) and squirming in your seat as you wait for something important to happen.  Story-wise, well, you'd be surprised how little plot there is.  Aside from what I've described, there's hardly anything else to be mentioned.  None of the plot twists are surprising or even amusingly over-the-top, so you'll probably find yourself tapping your feet out of boredom.
This might have been a somewhat engaging venture if I cared about the situation and the characters, but no, Banderas' is too gullible to root for and Jolie is...well...I've honestly never much liked Jolie; she's always one-note with her performances and her huge lips and really creepy resemblance to Jon Voight (her dad) is a distraction that not even decent acting (which she doesn't even qualify for) can account for.  The fact that both actors (as well as Thomas Jane) don't even seem to realize they're starring in such a trashy film only damages the film further.  They take this material waaayyy too seriously.
The only thing worthy of note in this entire film is a somewhat graphic sex scene between Banderas and Jolie.  Cinema these days has grown rather tame with on-screen sex, so I guess it's nice to see nudity on display in a big-studio release (though, make no mistake, even unrated, this scene is still not as graphic or even as well-directed as the sex scenes in Color of Night or Basic Instinct).  Unfortunately, director Michael Cristofer manages to even screw up this scene, giving us way too many fade-ins and odd camera angles as if though he thought he was ""spicing"" things up.  No, it just adds a yawn.  Hard to believe, but Jolie managed to star in the two worst films of 2001, an accomplishment I don't think any actor can boast.

It turned out to be a bit better than the soft porn I had expected, with a storyline and everything.  Although some called the ending predictable, I didn't see it coming; although there were parts of the plot I saw from an hour away.

Much panned by critics and a letdown at the box office, this is actually a much better example of its genre than one might first believe. The leads are engaging (particularly the dazzling Jolie), the mystery deep and dark, and the depiction of Eros and the madness induced by his poison arrows true to life. Michael Cristofer's direction is fluid and frequently original, even if his story is not. The film's primary handicaps are a flagging pace in the middle and some glaringly bad dialogue. Of course this isn't high drama, but the viewer who doesn't expect too much should find ""Original Sin"" a generally fun and mostly painless way to waste a couple of expendable hours.",1031443200,,881,4.802631578947368

I had to sit through the torture that was watching this film because it was movie night with my co-workers, and the movie was picked by the person who's turn it was to pick the movie. I think he expected hot scenes with Angelina Jolie because of the title, especially since he did not bother to find out what it was about. All I can say is that although I understood what the film was trying to convey the vehicle by which the msg was being delivered was boring, slow, and sometimes what they said did not make sense to what was happening. In some parts, it was as if the words did not carry as much conviction as needed for whatever was happening at the time.
I would have liked to walk out of the movie, as did the two people sitting besides me, however we stick to whatever movie was chosen by the ""movie picker of the week."" So as one of the people who watched the movie with me had to say: Sitting there not being able to leave was like being killed internally by microscopic fire ants, slowly and tiny bites taking you apart piece by piece....",1030492800,9,1123,4.227906976744186

Where I am especially insulted is that it was rewritten so as to dumb the whole film down so that I, as the ""average"" American, would find it less quirky and original than ""Mermaid"" and more like typical Hollywood drek written for the masses for big box office.  I don't think they got their big box office (thankfully) but this is as unpleasant to watch as ""Mermaid"" was a delight.  A brother to the female lead (Jolie) has been written into the script as a villain and the film goes downhill from the point the brother first appears in the film.  Banderas and Jolie both have acute problems with picking good film projects for their considerable talents, a trend that unfortunately continued for both of them with this film. Finally, in any mail order bride book or movie, did you ever think you'd end up with Antonio Banderas or Jean Paul Belmondo as a husband or Angelina Jolie or Catherine Deneuve as a wife?  I certainly didn't.  I was willing to go with that preposterous notion because ""Mermaid"" was so good but wasn't willing to go with it here. Really, we'd all be mail order brides and grooms if we could get these kinds of results through placing a mail order.  My advice: buy ""Mississippi Mermaid"" instead.

True, Luis seems a little less wordly than you would expect a rich, prostitute user of pre revelutionary Cuba to be, but Antonio is able to carry that off. One of the most believiable scenes is Luis, drunk and longing for Julia, is bent on finding her to kill her. You hope that he does! The story is a bit strained but I grew up on this kind of love hungary ""film noir"" movie. All in all, it is intertaining and isn't that what this is all about? If we wnated plausable stories we wouldn't be watching a to be intertained but to be educated.
I think this movie did educate, don't get me wrong, the love scenes between Julia and Luis were VERY educational and believable, i'm sure many would have loved to change partners with Antonio or Anjolina!

These two actors provide the sexual tension lacking from many of todays movies.  If you are looking for a true to life movie, this probably isn't for you.

1670477,5,B00005V4YF,"i have to say, i love this movie ... ""you can't walk away from love"" how true is that? To see a person who is so much in love and can do anything and everything to be with the other is just an amazing thing. Antonio (Luis in the movie) kills a detective and ""will do it again"" as he said in the movie, just to be with Angelina)--and I do know some guys that would too, hehehe [....] Love lets you forgive and forget, and I guess this movie shows the deepest and darkest feeling of a man, once he is truly in love. My boyfriend once said the things Luis has said but i didn't believe him, now that I've seen the movie, the excelent convincing act of Antonio, I start to believe that men are capible of loving as deep as women do. After all, they are humans! :p
The scenery is beautiful and i haven't seem a movie with an erotic scenery after the movie ""Indocine"" The wardrops just a fasticinating ... curves around Angelina's body and Antonio's great bottom (not to mention, the ""steamful"" scene-- only unrated has extra [....] The plot is twisted, making you have to follow it carefully. The language uses in film is the best. It tells each actions and feelings precisely. The movie is even stated ""This is not a love story but this is a story about love"" and I have to agree, it is! It tells you much about the differences between love and lust--in the comparasion and contrast between Luis and Billy (Bonnie's first love) The actions and the words are painted beautifully but bluntly on how the characters' views and feelings. You don't have to guess much on the plot but the plot itself make you think, make you choose which side are you on, make you feel sorry for a person who is fighting between good and evil, love and lust, new and old; and the pain of wanting to let go and become new but afraid of not being accepted. As much as I praise this, the ending is just too off ... maybe it is me but the ending seems to be detacted from the great hr and a half of the movie. I'm still thinking on how did they have the ending. But anyway, Antonio's naked body is it for me! love the accent, love the act, love him, and love his cute behind!

I strongly believe that this film proves that no matter what kind of person you are, there is someone out there in the world that will love you in spite of all of your flaws, the way Luis felt for Julia. In spite of her treachery, he still loved her, because that is what true love is. Julia is right, it is not a love story, but it IS a story about love.",1023667200,2,602,4.2894736842105265

Yeah, maybe just the one - personally I think it's seen better days.  Somebody else described ""Original Sin"" as a convincing period piece.  Um, it's not.  This is not Cuba of any period, this is a 2 hour Ralph Lauren Safari ad.  But you know, I saw it in the theatre (on a date, isn't that hilarious) and then I rented the DVD, cuz what can I say, sometimes I enjoy a 2 hour Ralph Lauren Safari ad.  Specifically I like that scene with all those petals raining down on that huge party in the hotel in (I think it's supposed to be) Havana.  I watch that and I want to be there.  Also, the actors are eye candy.  And since I did see both the theatrical release and the DVD, I know what the DVD includes for ""extra footage"" - but I could probably have guessed anyway.  I mean, we've got two naked people on a bed of roses on the cover, with ""Unrated Edition"" scrolled across the top and a pull-quote that says ""Steamy!""  Things get pretty raw in this movie considering it isn't an actual porno - don't watch it if sex annoys you or whatever.  I wonder if Melanie and Billy Bob get together on a Sunday night and watch it.  Other than that it just seems to play off Angelina Jolie's public persona as a beautiful, slightly disturbed, sexually charismatic in a vaguely wicked way, thrill-seeking bad girl.  It's a shame she hasn't been in more really good films, cuz she has proved she can act.  But ""Tomb Raider"" was awful, ""Life or Something Like It"" was awful, and this is beyond awful.  So awful it's hilarious - which can be a good thing.  Watch it and laugh, or watch it for the lush department store idealizations of Cuba, or watch it cuz you like to see pretty naked people having sex (admit it).

Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie are an attractive and charismatic pair, and the lush scenery (set it Cuba, I believe filmed in Mexico)and interesting, if not always logical or believable story make for good entertainment. Original Sin deals with a painful paradox --being madly in love with someone you know you can't trust. Even the overwrought melodrama and sometimes silly dialogue do not take away the basic fascination of this sort of eternal human problem.

Jolie plays Julia, a mail order bride who turns out to be something quite different from the catalogue item.  Banderas plays Luis, who falls instantly and madly (and stupidly) in love with her upon picking her up from her journey.
They have steamy sex with lots of gratuitous nudity and then the story begins.  Julia skips town with a bunch of Luis' cash and for the rest of the film, Luis follows her around like a lovesick lap dog begging her to take him back and abuse him some more.  The plot twists and turns, but the ""surprises"" are so obvious that they may as well have put up road signs saying, ""WATCH OUT, PLOT TWIST AHEAD.""
The dialogue is banal and mindless and the characters are transparent and simplistic.  The viewer comes away without being able to identify with either character.  Luis is so pathetic that we can feel only disgust and lack of respect for all his groveling, and Julia is so callous and wicked that no amount of attractiveness can overcome the revulsion she elicits.

There is one scene near the beginning of the movie that reveals a little to much to be called rated R, and seems to go on a little longer than necessary (about a full 2 minutes)... but other than that, i can hardly see what must have been cut out of the rated R version.
The plot of this movie is rather UNoriginal and predictable... but honestly, who watches an Angelina Jolie movie for the plot??? (think: Lara Croft: Tomb Raider).  A woman decieves a man, the man falls in love with her, and in the end... the woman realizes that she loves him back... blah blah.
HOWEVER, the visuals in this movie are incredible.  The costumes, the scenery, Angelina's hair-do's, etc. are just absolutely breath-taking.  It is a period piece - set in Cuba - and is very convincing in its setting.
I'd reccommend this movie not for the steamy sex (you'll be disappointed at the lack of it), not for the plot (because you'll guess it quite quickly), but just for the georgeous scenery and costumes (and beautiful actress too!).

The plot of ""Original Sin"" isn't too original. Wealthy Cuban landowner Antonio Banderas buys a mail-order bride (Jolie) and gets a little more than he bargained for. Not only is his bride-to-be more beautiful than the photo she sent, she is quite the cat in bed. Not exactly the demur Virginia schoolteacher she professed to be.
Following the typical Hollywood ""stupid male"" syndrome, Banderas signs over access to his fortune to his new bride, only to find she has absconded with his money. Not only does Banderas go off half-cocked in search of Jolie, but when he finds her, he only wishes to bed her, not concerned his fortune is gone. A bit too unrealistic here, considering Banderas was homicidal and violent only minutes earlier. Of course, Jolie is also following the Hollywood stereotype of female characters that fall in love with men who wish to kill them.
Thomas Jane adds an exciting dimension to the movie as the psychotic sidekick of Jolie, although their relationship isn't quite defined, nor explained. The ""spit in the mouth"" routine was quite disgusting and could have been left out with no detrimental affects to the movie.
In all, if you wish to see a lot of Angelina Jolie naked, this is the movie for you, although the flapping breast image was a bit much. Myself, personally, I could have went without seeing the naked butt of Antonio Banderas repeatedly, but to each their own. ""Original Sin"" is a skin flick of mild entertainment value.

At first, it moved along so fast that you were left wondering ""how did they get here"" or ""why did this happen"" Then towards the end of the movie, it's moving so slow that you're just begging for it to end. There were several plot holes that left me questioning some things in the film still. There was barely any character development at all and what there was of it, was just plain confusing. You don't really care about the characters and you can't really identify with them either.
The good sides: The reason I gave this any stars at all, was because the actors did a good job in the film. They didn't have much to work with and the script was weak at best, but Angelina did a good job and Antonio as well. This is the reason I gave this film 2 stars.
Otherwise, this film is not worth much. It's either confusing or boring depending on what point in the movie you're watching.

Angelina and Antonia Bare much. This is true. But its nothing that can't be seen in Tomb Raider, or Never Talk to Strangers (for the ladies).

1670515,4,B00005V4YF,"This is the kind of favorite movie you have to sit down and plot out your reasons for liking. Otherwise, you might feel guilty, uncultured, hedonistic... So I choose to plot out MY reasons here, for your judgement.
First, the drawbacks. The plot. It's not all that plausible. It's filled with sweeping turns, and its twists are definitely full spirals. There's not much subtlety in it to speak of. But that didn't bother me as a viewer--after all, the premise is that a man gets a mail-order bride and spends the rest of his time trying to figure her out! How much reality does one logically expect from that? But the premise is intriguing, it's interesting, and most importantly, Jolie and Banderas never let that interest wane. Their performances are emotional and strong. At one point when I was watching the movie I paused and thought, ""this is really stretching my suspension of belief,"" but no sooner did i think that than Jolie pulled out emotions that seemed so real and intense (Banderas closely following suit) that the entire situation was validated. That's what I think a good movie does--if it takes you out of the ordinary, fine, that's what entertainment does; but a good movie makes it real by showing you the people involved in the situation, and by understanding them you believe in and understand and forgive the implausibility of the situation. The movie explores the boundaries of fidelity, love, and honesty. I love it for that.
This is not Oscar-worthy, but it is, in my opinion, a very good film. The mood and the visuals are artistically consistent, and I respect movies that can do that.
Two things keep this from being an art film: the wild, fantasy plot, and the soft-porn-ishness of the sex scenes (very much a la Gia, which isn't surprising considering the director. I suspect that he just really likes seeing Angelina nude). But no matter how weird the plot, it's entertaining and (dare I say) thought provoking, and I can't think of many people who would mind the questionable taste of the sex between Angelina and Antonio.
The wardrobe's nice too.",1016323200,15,2080,4.796657381615599

We got gorgeous Angelina Jolie and sexy Antonio Banderas, and what do we expect more?  Yes, the story is ridiculous, I admit, but the classic noir ""Double Indenmity"" has also a very far-fetched story that would easily match that of this film.  Some point out that there already has been a French version of the story in ""Mississipi Mermaid"" directed by Truffaut, claiming ""Original Sin"" is just another Hollywood-made trash  remake, but Truffaut's one is not among his best works in spite of two French icons Catherine Deneuve and Jean-Paul Belmondo.
Simply put, ""Original Sin"" is about love.  Lots of love.  The film is set in the 19th century, Cuba.  Antonio made success with coffee trade, and receives a mail-ordered bride, Angelina.  They soon marry, and love each other, but she suddenly disappears with all his money.  Enraged Antonio traces her to Havana, where he finds out Angelina, now with a different beau.  Instead of killing her, he loves her again.  No, he makes love much, much, again.  But she has a secret, for which she suffers....  Nothing should be said about the latter half of the film (which completely differs from Truffaut's rather somber version) except that the ever winding story goes like Mulholland Drive.
The suspense element is too thin and the whole storyline is too incredible to take seriously, but the film somehow succeeds on one level, that is, descriptions of illogically passionate love between two leads, whose emotions flare up with enough chemistry to convince that they (actors) really mean it.  Antonio, first trying to take back money, soon decides to give everything; Angelina, first trying to deceive him, soon gives up herself.  I don't know how American audiences reacted to this illogical behaviors -- some have said it's stupid, yes, I understand -- but I, a Japanese, somehow find myself drawn deeply into their emotional relations.  After all, love is what makes people ridiculous, isn't it?  If so, they are very credible, I believe.
Everyone would agree that the production design is fine, and costume (of Angelina Jolie, especially) is delightful to look at.  (It was actually shot in Mexico; imagine wearing a suit there.)  Good photography makes up for perhaps unnecessary plot twist at the end.  Campy, you might say.  But as a ""Woman of Fate"" Angelina Jolie is perfect, and I am not the only one who would give everything to her -- and you too, Billy Bob?",1016064000,86,2530,4.947867298578199

Bandares and the always-delightful Jolie have a sexual chemistry that practically explodes off the screen.  I'm not going to summarize the plot; there are other reviews that can do that for you.  All I can say is this movie is a wonderful escape from reality for about 2 hours.  More absurd than any soap opera, more sexual than an HBO dramedy, and more sinister than Buffy, ""Original Sin"" will have your eyes glued to the screen as you silently fret that other people will discover you're not only watching it, but relishing it.",1007078400,3,678,4.720338983050848

However, this lover makes a dangerous wife.  She is heartless and born without a soul, but she makes a beautiful thief of hearts nonetheless.
The storyline draws the viewer through a twisted path of suspicion, betrayal, steaming sensuality and murder.  It is Eden gone very wrong.  A garden of lush erotica conceals a diabolical and rabid form of corruption.
I would suggest that the movie be seen.  Because of its utter lack of morality, it proves that beauty is only skin deep, a liar can never be trusted, and true love is the rarest and most precious of realities...if it can be found at all.",1005177600,,759,4.676691729323308

1670549,3,B00005V4YF,"The camera loves both Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas and it's exploited to the hilt in Michael Cristopher's ""Original Sin"" in which there is nothing much that is original or ground breaking. But like Cristopher's HBO, ""Gia"" Ms. Jolie's talents and attributes are much on display in ""Original Sin."" Is there a face in movies today that can tell a story as well as Jolie's or Banderas'? Banderas as Luis Vargas, a South American plantation owner, ""orders"" a mail bride, Julia Russel. Who lands, via Delaware but Ms. Jolie with not only trunk loads of clothes but also a trunk load of secrets. Banderas is looking for an heir not a mate, per se but Jolie has other things in mind i.e basically to win Banderas over and steal his money. But instead she falls in love with him...or does she? Cristopher sets up a portent tropical milieu filled with bananas, coffee and mosquito netting where the humidity and sexual attraction is so thick you could cut it with a knife. There are several plot twists that lead to deception and betrayal that require a lot of suspension of disbelief on the viewer's part to swallow and much of this works. Cristopher tries to do it all in the high style of the late 50's potboilers like ""The Long Hot Summer"" or ""Written on the Wind"" and almost succeeds. But hey with Jolie and Banderas as his actors he's got most of his work done with just a close-up and a twitch or a raised eywbrow on either of their faces. This movie is a HOOT and along the way you just may sweat and shiver along with the actors. Take a sweat rag with you to the theater...just in case.",998956800,18,1592,4.474226804123711
1670550,3,B00005V4YF,"This movie starts out like any terrible made for TV soap opera, but amazingly it continues to get better and it finishes up as an interesting new take on the femme fatale archetype.  It is somewhat hard to believe that such a well worn plot could yield any knew ideas, yet this film seems to make an interesting reversal on the theme that indicates a reflection of a social change in regards to the role of women and men in society.
The basic plot centers around a wealthy businessman (played by Antonio Banderas) who orders off for a mail-order bride who ""is not meant to be beautiful"" but rather, ""loyal, loving, and young enough to bear children.""  What he gets is Angelina Jolie, and though she isn't what he expected or claimed he wanted, he graciously decides to marry her anyway (I bet that was a tough choice).  I'm not giving anything away by telling you that Jolie totally screws up Banderas' life, stealing his fortune and causing him to lose his prestigious position.
Ok, so the plot of a woman whose sexuality is so strong that it causes a man to destroy his life isn't anything new.  But what makes this movie interesting is that it highlights the extreme vulnerablity of men.  Banderas' character is constantly willing to forgive Jolie's, not because of some crude lustful desire, but out of a sincere love and acceptance for Jolie's character.  Jolie's character is absolutely foul, and everybody in the film understands that, this makes the willingness for acceptance shown by the cuckolded Banderas oddly touching.  In a way, this film takes the old belief that love is essentially acceptance and forgiveness and takes it to such an extreme as to be totally absurd.  But if you're willing to go with it, the film is quite interesting.
In order for the film to work at all, there must be some sort of explination for Jolie's character, Bonnie.  She must be essentially good, but forced, somehow, to perform evil.  This difficulty is handled with the introduction of Billy.  Billy is essentially Bonnie's pimp and is able to exert an iron hold on her emotions.  Their relationship is quite similar to that shown between Sharon Stone and James Woods in ""Casino.""  It seems quite clear that our society believes that women are inherently vulnerable to decietful males.  The prevalence of deadbeat dads seems to bear this out, but for the sake of maintaining a more equal view of gender, perhaps it should be suggested that this is just a male fantasy.  However, even as a fantasy,this idea has some revelance and social impact that should be explored.  The main question it raises is: if women are suceptible to these adverse influences, how can you pry them away?  Real love should be the answer, but ""Original Sin"" suggests that any woman actually in this position would be leary enough of lies in the disguise of real love to disregard love if it ever did turn up.
It is an interesting question, and it was totally surprising to see it dealt with so deftly in a movie such as this.  Granted, there are many things that are terrible about this film.  Many of the scenes go on too long and seem redundant or ridiculous.  However, both Banderas and Jolie are superb and you can't help but be drawn in.  In the end, you find yourself thinking about this movie a lot more than you ever anticipated you would.  It is a pleasant surprise and that alone makes it worth taking a look at.",998092800,6,3395,4.651591289782244

1670552,2,B00005V4YF,"""Original Sin"" is a daring but unsuccessful attempt at an erotic thriller, baring Angelina Jolie's bust but never bearing a soul worth caring about. Actors Jolie and Antonio Banderas are in fine form, and just to see them act together is worth it, even if their talents are cast into a lost cause.
The writer and director of the film, Michael Christofer, gives the film two different complexes. One makes the film look like an honest effort on his part to make a movie that reveals too many of its secrets work. The other makes it look like one of those skin flicks that one can easily find on Cinemax in the early hours before dawn, only given an A-list cast and Hollywood gloss.
The film stars Banderas as Luis Durand, a rich coffee mill owner who is looking for a woman to be his wife, bear him children, and be kind and loyal. He's not interested in love, though his head certainly turns when he meets the woman he has sent for, Julia Russell, played by the overly busty Jolie. She provides simple explanations for why she did not write to him, and why the photograph he received looks nothing like her.
They waste no time in getting married, then taking their time to get to know one another. He gives her full access to his bank accounts, his house, and his love, which is sullied when she runs away, his money in hand. What she leaves behind is a trunk with the real Julia Russell's belongings inside, and feelings of betrayal and rage in Luis's heart.
Up to this point, the movie has built up some momentum. A scene involving Julia's sister protesting that the handwriting in Julia's letter is not that of her sister's has some impact an the opener for Luis's realization that Julia is not really Julia at all. And, despite what the critics will say, Jolie and Banderas do have some chemistry onscreen, more so in scenes that do not involve sex.
The movie is bold in giving us such a vivid depiction of sexual activity, however softcore it is, but in doing this, it causes the audience to lose interest in the rest of the story. Not only were people in the audience snickering during these scenes, but they really do not fit into the big picture. We know they are in love, so what is the purpose of scenes such as this?
As the film moves on, it begins to trip on itself. Luis hunts and reclaims Julia, and they reconcile their differences. When a rather mysterious detective comes into play (played by Thomas Jane), Luis shoots him, and the story turns into Bonnie and Clyde (incidentally, Julia's real name in the film is Bonnie). They go on the run, still being chased by the detective who is still alive and meeting Julia in secret to discuss Luis's financial ruin and timely death.
Truth is, the movie is just not that interesting. The beginning is not too bad, but the second half of the film is unbelievable, contrived, and listless. Luis wants her back because he is so consumed by his love for her, which would be convincing if the movie did not play him to be a whining martyr. He has force in the beginning, but as the movie wears out its welcome, he becomes little more than putty in Julia's hands.
The ending is also a complete betrayal of what the movie has been trying to prove all along. In the beginning narration, it is said that ""this is not a story about love, but about the power it holds over people."" The movie gets the power point right, yes, but in the end, the love aspect of that speech finds its way into the picture, throwing us for a loop when our predictions were centered on an unhappy ending.
Watching ""Original Sin"" reminded me of such movies as ""The Scarlet Letter"" and ""Eye of the Beholder,"" two movies that were given harsh reviews as well. ""Letter"" worked for me because, despite the fact that it strayed from the novel, the story was still enjoyable. ""Beholder"" was a nice unconventional film to watch, with superb lead performances. ""Original Sin"" is unconventional, and has good acting, but somewhere along the line, it fails to hold any interest as it dwindles down.",997574400,15,4015,4.501369863013698

A few nude scenes, bloody shootings, unnatural coincidences, and a love triangle.  Well, this movie was satisfying with all that plus a few twists of the story. No wonder the movie hall was empty. It is a movie directed by Michael Cristofer and acted out somewhat well by Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie and Thomas Jane in the backdrop of Havana a hundred years back.

1670555,3,B00005V4YF,"With stars such as Angelina Jolie, and Antonio Bandaras one would think that 'Original Sin' would be a certain blockbuster. The plot holds promise as the audience is slowly drawn into the seductive world of early 1900's Cuba, each image lush as it exploits the tropic clime in which the movie is set. The sun gleaming brightly as Luis rushes towards the docks to meet his mail order bride to be. Each second passes interminably, as the film tries to build tension, as Luis searches for his bride to be, before he finally finds Julia amongst the many travellers.  Enchanted by the unexpected beauty Luis finds himself immersed in a web of intrigue, lies, and obsession as he follows where his heart takes him.
The Premise of 'Original Sin' IS interesting. How far would you go for love? When does love become obsession? However the questions remain up in the air as the actors go through the motions in a somewhat mechanical manner as the plot of this 'thriller' twists and turns rather predictably.
The love scenes added little to the overall plot of the movie, even if they were mildly entertaining in their own right. There were only two things memorable about the movie: 1.) The Cinematography, served to enhance so/so performances and created a beautiful yet sometimes dark setting.  2.) Jolie's performance in a single scene near the end of the movie.
Otherwise 'Original Sin' is an average movie. A good way to pass time, but not something that will be remembered long past the time the theatre posters have been taken down, and it's pushed from the new release rack in the video store.",997315200,6,1592,4.743682310469314
