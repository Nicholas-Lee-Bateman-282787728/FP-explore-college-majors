8447003,5,B004XJM42Q,"Fascinating! It isn't easy to see the fleas, but they really do seem to be ""trained"". It would be wonderful to have some sophisticated camera-work that really zooms in on the fleas.  The kind of patience and ingenuity it required to put this circus together certainly justifies a fancier production, with more camera angles and closer close-ups. Each flea has a name and a specialty. Daniel Cros  gives a fine show followed by a discussion of the training process.",1408492800,,464,4.860759493670886
