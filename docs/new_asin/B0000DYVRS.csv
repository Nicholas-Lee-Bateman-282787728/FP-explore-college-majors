1928324,4,B0000DYVRS,"Its brilliant, exept for the fact that songs are missing. If you watch ""Cry Me River"" first you will be blown away, its that good and i'm not saying it just because i'm a fan, IT'S BRILLIANT!!!
Buy it fans and those who like him a bit.",1072569600,,235,4.0212765957446805
1928325,4,B0000DYVRS,all in all it was great but it definently doesnt seem the same after seeing ot live. they only played 6 of the 13 or 12 or watever songs on it the the video was hott an dso is justin i suggest you buy it also becuz of the bonus cd w/ im lovin it and worthy of ( a hiiden tra ck only a few people got lucky to get on the original cd) and 2 remixes. good except for miising songs actually would be 4.9,1072051200,,399,3.5977011494252875
1928326,5,B0000DYVRS,"I bought this dvd on Saturday 20, and couldn't stop playing later!  although you are not his fan, I think you may be change your mind if you see his performance in this dvd!  He's a real artist that can sings and dances. I love everything about him, I love every songs but my favorite is 'Cry me a river' because in this song he seems mysterious man that looks calm and hot at the same time!  I love emotion of song and his acting, so I was impressed and cried. I never loved any singers like him before. I think he's cute and has talent. Like a fan from USA said, 'I can't imagine music without him'.  I'm really glad with his success, I love him and he will on my heart forever....",1071964800,,683,4.074626865671642
1928327,5,B0000DYVRS,we couldn't afford tickets to the justified and stripped tour when it came to town and i was really bummed because justin is my definate favorite artist.  hes so talented and awesome at what he does and hes even totally sexy to add to that...when i got this dvd for an early xmas present i was so happy cuz i got to see sorta what went down and its so awesome..definately best dvd of all time!! =D,1071878400,,397,4.1558441558441555
1928328,5,B0000DYVRS,"i have to say this video is HOT, because it make me feel that i am still part in the concert, and its a bit short wish can be longer. other then that i love it, it make me happy when i see him after a long stress out day at work. so i been very happy about this dvd.",1070928000,3,266,3.45
1928329,2,B0000DYVRS,"Although the show is great and the bonus CD is a nice extra I think a playing time of only 44 minutes is way too short. It's not even the full show as at least the track ""Last night"" is excluded from this DVD that is so short already !!! Why such a rush job ??? Why not a cool tour documentary about the amazing year Justin had both on and off the road ? What about tour rehearsals and stuff like that ? A ""full"" DVD with the bonus CD as addition (for a bonus CD there's nothing to complain as the audio CD is a really neat extra)would be the package that was REALLY interesting. This seems like a quick cash-in and somehow I do expect a ""full"" DVD incl. rehearsals etc. next year...",1070496000,,683,4.029411764705882
1928330,5,B0000DYVRS,dis is the best dvd eva! and justin is turning up d heat wit his hott looks and all. he was looken hotter dan eva. the sound is different slightly but it is even moor awesome dan d original. im a picky person and i luv dis 1 so u have a good chance of luving it 2!!,1067644800,2,265,3.586206896551724
1928331,5,B0000DYVRS,"Only place you can see the New ""I'm Loving it"" video. Shows a more intamate outlook towards Justin. See him comefront many intresting Dilemnas Towards his England Tour. Very Must-Have for any Music,Dvd,Or Jt Lake Fan.",1065830400,11,217,5.055555555555555
1928370,5,B0000DYVRS,cant  help myself he is the best entertainer this side of heaven  see how  much i like him nice real,1366070400,,100,3.9
1928371,5,B0000DYVRS,"its not easy for an american to cross over to england... and vice versa. which is why when you find yourself in demand in both, you act as a representative showing common ground. to do that your music has to show what is great about one, and honor what is just as good, in another. artists are ambassadors whether they want to be or not. music will always have that unifying effect when power is used responsibly. this video does just that.",1364169600,,440,4.378048780487805
1928372,5,B0000DYVRS,this is an awesome product because it didn't stop at any time and it looked new. In the future i might purchase another product.,1357084800,,128,4.375
1928373,1,B0000DYVRS,I was very dissapointed with this DVD. Half the songs on the DVD I had never heard and the DVD wasn't very long.,1223769600,,112,3.9130434782608696
1928374,5,B0000DYVRS,"I LOVED this DVD. I know that someone in these reviews complained that it wasn't the ""whole concert"". Let's compare 1/2 concert vs. none. It's like they put many clips of the concert smoothly together. You heard JT singing clearly and saw him dancing clearly. It was several songs from Justified and made me feel like I was at a JT concert again. A MUST FOR ALL FANS AND COLLECTORS!",1191628800,,382,4.4714285714285715
1928375,4,B0000DYVRS,"I was reading pass reviews on this DVD and I had to see it to believe it. I'm a huge fan of his and I didn't care that it was only 90 minutes of show time. Although, their could have been some more features. Hopefully when Justin comes back on tour again and puts out a new album, i'll release another DVD with more extended material. Another good thing is that it has a BONUS CD! So if your a true fan you will really enjoy the DVD!",1125619200,,433,3.9318181818181817
1928376,4,B0000DYVRS,"This DVD shows off Justin's amazing stage presence and considerable skill in working the audience. However, the whole concert is not featured for some reason, which is a bit of a shame - I was at one of his Wembley Arena dates, and the audience response to ""Take It From Here"" was fantastic, so I don't know why they have omitted it.
The audio CD is good just for ""Lovin' It"" - anyone who has the European version of ""Justified"" will probably have ""Worthy Of"" already.
Worth buying if you are a JT fan.",1082678400,6,502,4.351063829787234
1928377,3,B0000DYVRS,I was very upset to see that it wasn't the whole concert (meaning just Justin...not Christina).  When buying it I had expectations of the whole concert...I mean why would you only put some of the performances on there?  Of course I would have still bought it if I had known and wouldn't sell it because it is Justin.  However I will say that I was disapointed.,1077926400,4,360,4.424242424242424
1928378,5,B0000DYVRS,"It's so damn good!!!!!you can see Justin's great live performances!!!his lives are the best that I've ever seen! but it's a little short,only less than 1 hour",1077667200,2,158,4.888888888888889
1928408,4,B0000DYVRS,if u like justin this is the perfct dvd for u. its just justin being hisself and doing what he loves to do. the way he loves to do it. his own way. ithink this is one of the best dvds i have ever seen. i think u will love it.,1077148800,,225,3.4313725490196076
1928409,3,B0000DYVRS,"Took my cousin (15) and myself (33) to his concert 2003 (San Jose,Ca) but of course bought the tickets too late (3 days) and had seats behind the stage (which they should sell cheaper),we could see him (his back)/dancers (there backs) come to the corner of the stage once and a while but luckly we had a small screen to watch the concert (but it would of been 10 times worth it if we had seats visibale to the front of the stage 'cause of the way ALL the girls where SCREAMING- I felt we were missing Alot...I think he's a GREAT dancer (wished I could dance like him) and singer (lyrics to the point)...My favorite part from the concert is when he did the Live Beat Box for almost 10 minutes straight (which it's very long being done live) but was not on this dvd (not Justified)...Justin?!, did you have any say/input into this dvd and why didn't you add the Beat Box performance?!",1076716800,,882,4.351515151515152
1928410,3,B0000DYVRS,"I will admit I and my 5 year old daughter, enjoyed watching this DVD. HOWEVER, my disappointment is that it is clear that this does not show the entire concert. I am a huge NSync and JT fan (probably the oldest at 41 - no kidding!) and have all the NSync concert videos since where I live its kind of difficult to get to see one live (somewhere in the Caribbean is all I'll say!). I have never felt ""cheated"" when I watched the NSync videos in the way that I have for this one. But, I'm glad I got it and its an essential part of any true fan's collection.  So, a message to all fans...this is a must get....but try not to be as disappointed as I am that its just a portion of the concert and not the entire show. Hopefully the producers will issue another with the entire show sometime in the future.",1074988800,5,801,4.101910828025478
1928411,4,B0000DYVRS,"First off, I saw this boy live during the summer and man! I was impressed, this boy can jam!! He put on an awesome show and it shows on this DVD. Justin proves that he's got what it takes to be a talent solo performer, he sings, dances and plays instruments plus he wrote all the songs on his debut album...what more can you ask for? Filmed in London, this felt like I was back in my seat at the SBC Center in San Antonio this past June. It was incredible, even Christina put on a good show because the next day I rushed to buy her album, ""Stripped"". Justin put his heart and soul in this tour and you can truly tell. Still, I docked a star due to it's shortness, seriously, he sang almost every song off of his album except for ""(Oh, No) What You Got?"" and ""Never Again"", he even played guitar on ""Take It From Here"" (my personal fave off the album), why did they take all this good stuff out and only featured Justin dancing away on his most major hits? With featuring the ""I'm Lovin' It"" video (which he just looks fine in) and a bonus CD with two remixes, ""I'm Lovin' It"" and a unreleased ""Justified"" track makes this DVD worthwhile to get even though the concert could've been longer. A must have for Justin fans everywhere and for those who missed this awesome concert.",1074902400,2,1275,4.251028806584362
1928412,4,B0000DYVRS,"It's JT live! Not the same videos you see over and over again. Therefore this is highly recommended over the JT video collection. He is all sweaty in this one. Seems like a lot of times he is not singing though, but it's him live!",1074124800,,230,4.133333333333334
1928413,5,B0000DYVRS,"I was at this concert, and I can assure you that what you see on the DVD is only half as good as the full concert was. Even so, this is a must have for all JT fans and anyone else who wants to see how live performing should be done.",1073347200,,232,3.5686274509803924
1928414,3,B0000DYVRS,"No the concert was not disappointing... the fact that only 6 songs were featured in this ""Live"" DVD.  As for the performance itself.. Justin definitely knows how to put on a good show.. if only his fans could get to re-live it in its entirety!  I hope Christina's DVD has the whole concert... they should have released a Justified and Stripped DVD with both concerts..that would have been a sell out!!  C'mon guys... get a clue!!  Still... just to have snippets from an excellent performance.. u have to get this DVD!",1073260800,2,517,4.648351648351649
1928415,3,B0000DYVRS,"Justin & Britney have to be the greatest entertainers on the planet. I just don't understand the songs that Justin performed at this concert were cut from the DVD??? It just makes no sense especially since they were all great performances.
The bonus cd which includes ""I'm Loving It"" and the ""I'm Loving It"" music video is great. ""Worthy Of"" is a definet must have and the two remixes are great also.",1072915200,2,400,4.569444444444445
1928416,4,B0000DYVRS,"This JT DVD comes in a beautiful, colorful package.  It folds out to contain the live DVD and then the bonus music CD.  It also has a booklet with the tracklisting and some artsy JT photos.
The DVD itself is good, albeit very short.  It includes a nifty Tour Diary with some photos of JT hanging out backstage playing table tennis, working out and includes some stills of him onstage.  The concert includes all of JT's released singles, here's the DVD track list:
1. Intro
2. Rock Your Body
3. Right for Me
4. Gone/Girlfriend/Senorita
5. Nothin' Else
