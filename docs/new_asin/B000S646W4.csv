8601944,4,B000S646W4,"This film starts at Nikko, the shrine to Ieasu Tokugawa, the first of the Tokugawa Shoguns.  It features exquisitely decorated temple carvings of dragons and other decorations.  One temple is dedicated to warriors who fell during Kublai Khan's two attempted invasions of Japan.  Kublai Khan was ultimately defeated by the Kamikaze or ""Divine Wind"" when his invading fleets were broken up by storms.  The film presents a temple where, in previous centuries, women seeking a divorce could obtain one if they were willing to live for three years as nuns.  Several Zen temples are presented, some of them with Cherry trees or Junipers planted hundreds of years ago, including the ""Mind-Character Garden"" - a Zen garden with a pool in the shape of the character for the word ""Mind.""  Also, a temple to Hachiman, the god of war and, a hall lined with ""Hell judges"" - bureaucrats from Hell with horrific faces.  The film takes us to the Kamakura ""Dai-Butsu"", an 80-ton statue of Amida Buddha and the #1 tourist attraction in Kamakura.  For unborn or aborted children, there is a temple with a huge collection of Jizo statues; also a 10-faced statue of Kannon, the god of mercy, nine meters tall.  A Shinto temple is presented where, if one burns incense, it is possible to heal different parts of the body by first touching the incense smoke and then touching the part of the body which requires healing.  There are also some shots from the Japan National Museum, which houses the largest art collection in Japan, and shots of the shrine to the Meiji Emperor, who ended the rule of the Tokugawa Shoguns.

""Sakura Petals - The Shoguns"" is accompanied by a low key voice-over historical narrative.  There is no gabby tour guide standing at the center of the scene.  This is a low-budget tourist film, and includes shots of local food and local street scenes.  Like the other Flying Monk films, it is a good film for anyone planning a trip to Asia or simply interested in studying the history of Buddhism in Japan.",1264118400,,2004,4.754335260115607
