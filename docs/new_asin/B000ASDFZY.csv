8079529,5,B000ASDFZY,"I had a version of this on VHS that I had taped off TV, of course I don't have a VCR any longer, and couldn't use my favorite body toning and sculpting tool. So I have both now on DVD, and love them. This is a quick and easy version of the full body workout. Couldn't get through my day without them",1492819200,,299,3.838709677419355
8079530,5,B000ASDFZY,"If you're looking for a quick way to relieve tension and stress that doesn't involve complicated stretch sequences only extremely flexible people can successfully do, then this may the perfect DVD for you.  Unlike the other titles in Michelle LeMay's ""Spirit Flow"" series, these seven ""essential stress relievers"" aren't over-the-top spiritual or difficult for the beginner.  Also different from the other DVDs, this workout is less of a full-body stretch and more of exactly what it says-stress relief.

Like the title says, this workout is divided into seven different sections all intended to melt away stress.  Unfortunately, when the entire 25 minutes (not the 60 minutes the product description says) is done together, it can feel a bit disjointed since the DVD doesn't seem intended to be done as one full routine.  It breaks the attitude of relaxation to do a standing stretch, move to sitting, go back to standing, now lie down etc.  It's not a big deal, it just makes this seem more like a workout and less like a meditation, which can be good.

The seven stress relievers are:

1. Spinal Roll Series - Michelle does this at the beginning of her other ""Spirit Flow"" workouts, as well.  This is basically just rolling down to where you are simply hanging at the waist.  You do it forward and to each side several times.

2. Torso Stretch & Tone - This section is done from a cross-legged position on the ground.  You will lean side-to-side a few times before doing a few rolls forward from one side to the middle to the other side.

3. Upper Body Loosener - This is probably the easiest segment to do.  It's quite simply a neck roll.  Eventually you add your upper back to the roll.

4. Hip & Lower Back - You begin lying down on the floor (you will probably wish to use a mat) and you bring your knees to your chest.  You then cross one ankle over the other knee to feel the stretch and start to rock side to side.  It may be one of the more difficult stretches to do, but it is also one of my favorites.  It's very easy to work up to.

5. Hip & Torso Rock & Roll - From a cross-legged position on the floor, you bend forward and from this position you rock right and left.  You then switch your front leg in your cross-legged position and repeat.

6. Full Body Renewal - Michelle says that this is advanced, but I don't find that it is.  You start with the neck roll that you've already learned and each time get deeper and deeper moving through your upper back, middle back, and lower back.

7. Complete Breath Workout - Lying on the floor, you concentrate on your breathing alone to calm your body down.  Michelle will lead your through deep belly breaths, deep chest breaths, and deep breaths including both the belly and the chest.  I love this segment as it really relaxes me fully.

As I stated before, this DVD is not a full-body stretch.  You really will only stretch your neck, back, hips, and torso.

Considering that this was supposed to be meditative stretching, I didn't think that Michelle moved too slow at all.  I also didn't find any of her outfits extremely improper, although I have to admit that it's a bit odd to do part of a stretch workout in a bikini.  The stretches are all very beginner, but having advanced stretches wouldn't have relieved stress for me-it would have added it since I would have been (badly) trying to master the difficulty.  Even though nothing is very complicated here, I still think that advanced stretchers will find relaxation within these segments.

Overall, I've written somewhat of a lengthy review since there seems to be a bit of debate over whether or not this is a worthwhile DVD.  I hope I've been able to let you know if it's something you want.  I highly recommend it as a very easy stretch DVD that takes less than 30 minutes; it's one of my favorite stretch DVDs to do!

If you want something a bit longer but just as relaxing and simple, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-Candlelight-Yoga/dp/B00006FMB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch - Candlelight Yoga</a>.

8079531,2,B000ASDFZY,"I tried her other Spirit flow almost a year ago & wrote a lengthy review. She moves so slow, you'll fall asleep. She does basic exercises that most dance, etc. use as warm up & she then proceeds to take a 5-7 min warm up & turn it into 22 min.
This is best for those who are totally out of shape or can't exercise. Otherwise save your money.
The production quality is great & I do agree if she has that big a chest (hey she was born lucky), she shouldn't be wearing such a low-cut tank shirt & the bikini on the beach scene... it must be for the men.

I'd write what's in it, but I don't have to since you can see almost the whole thing on youtube.",1184976000,8,648,3.909090909090909
8079532,5,B000ASDFZY,These 7 routines are simple yet highly effective in reducing stress. I can literally feel the tension melting away when I do these stretches. I feel much more balanced in general. The DVD is a must purchase for anyone who just wants to feel better!!,1174521600,5,249,4.555555555555555
8079533,1,B000ASDFZY,"I had trouble taking this routine seriously. First off Michelle LeMay starts by talking about yoga, laying forward with her large chest in plain view. Then in the routines it seems to be all about her and how she looks, including yoga on the beach in a skimpy bikini.

In addition, I think the DVD quality is poor. When played on my DVD player it broke up (like the cheap ones do). I had also purchased one of LeMay's other DVDs and it wouldn't even play. I sent my copy back to Amazon.",1171065600,13,486,4.225806451612903
