2675021,5,B000JJR0RS,"I didn't have any specific expectations in the DVD. The pictures looked pretty, the price was good and so far I had no ""fireplace-DVD"" so I gave it a try.
I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. The cover is nicely designed and the DVD has a stylish shore image printed onto it. The same style is continued in the DVD menus which are easy to use and again pretty to look at. By now I have seen all of the nature scenes (seven) on this DVD and found that they are as promised: relaxing and thanks to their variety fitting all kinds of different moods. Having seen the trailer I already knew I would get a variety of ocean views, a water fall and some green forest like scenes. What the trailer did not tell was how beautiful they look on a TV-sized screen. I love the scenery and the colors! It's also great that there is a choice between the nature sounds and two different music tracks per scene. It jumps up the variety even more. The music itself consists mainly of relaxed piano/violin pieces with catchy little melodies that I don't grow tired of even if they run over a longer period of time like dinner.
For a little break between family and job I used to stand in the kitchen with a coffee in hand and the remaining to-do-list in my head. Now I sit down, turn on the DVD player and enjoy. I really look forward to these timeouts and they put me in a better mood which has already been noticed by my family. During meals the DVD sets a nice atmosphere that my family enjoys very much. Even my pets respond to it. Their favorite is the waterfall with its original sounds. They gather around the TV and listen intently. Quite funny to watch for the rest of us.

Summary: I would recommend this DVD to everyone looking for a relaxation, nature or ""fireplace"" DVD. It makes a great present for practically anyone and any occasion. A great buy for the price.",1161216000,13,1864,4.340974212034384
8151465,2,B000JJR0RS,"The video is taken by the set camera on the scene.
The picture quality is poor, it doesn't really bring you to the scene of serenity to realx.
Kind of reminds me of old cable TV show with low budget.
I'd give away this DVD to someone if anybody wants to have it.
Never seen this again after first time.",1311033600,,302,4.05
8151466,1,B000JJR0RS,"I have HD TV, so maybe that makes a difference.  But this video is really poor.  The beach scenes were so cheesy, fake appearing, as in olden days hollywood movies made on set instead of on site.  The best of the choices is Summer Springs.  Out of seven, it's the only one I can watch.  I'm giving this thing to the library.  Maybe it won't bother someone else so much.  I certainly didn't find anything here to be serene, nor relaxing.  Sorry.  Wasted money.",1264377600,2,459,4.369047619047619
8151467,4,B000JJR0RS,"The Blue Water scene is just like sitting on the beach.  I grew up in Pensacola Florida with white sand beaches and blue green water.  The ""Blue Water"" segment produces the same chemical feeling of relaxtion in my body that sitting on the beach does.  I watch it almost every morning for a half hour while reading the paper.  The two scenes with birds chirping are annoying though.",1255219200,,381,4.5588235294117645
8151468,2,B000JJR0RS,"I was a bit disappointed when I watched this DVD. It was a bit boring...I mean, you really have to know before you buy this DVD what this DVD really is all about. This is not a movie, this is not a documentary, what they did is just put a rolling camera on a beach for a example in one of their episodes or in the mountains and let it film for about 5-10 minutes. That's it. Nothing more literally! I had a feeling that I was looking at a plain live web camera. No scenery changing, no new views, just the same static picture. It gets really boring after 3-4 minutes. I don't necessarily say that this DVD is horrible, I just want to say that it is overpriced! For the video content it has I would pay no more than, say, $4.99 at the most  - that would be the right price for this type of DVD. On top of everything, the DVD disk they used was actually a DVD-R media! What kind of cheap guys they really are!",1249171200,,907,4.011049723756906
8151469,4,B000JJR0RS,"I really didn't expect much but I was pleasantly surprised. This DVD is a very nicely produced combination of sights and sounds.  Comforting and relaxing, just put it on in the background or at night while going to sleep and before long you realize how well it put's you in a special place.  Tantalizing photography and stunning video with life like nature sounds or gentle music makes going to bed a wonderful experience.  Or just put it in the DVD player and let it loop all day and your home will quickly become a place of tranquility and peacefulness.  You won't be dissapointed with this and the price matches the quality of the product.  Sit back, relax and enjoy.",1231804800,3,670,4.5966386554621845
8151470,5,B000JJR0RS,"I just purchased Views and I must say this DVD is amazing. Beautiful imagery, relaxing sounds. I come home from a very stressful work environment and turn this on now everyday - specifically ""Colder Days."" This DVD is genius to allow you to choose between nature sounds and soothing music. It's also great for my flatscreen tv to be on while having guests over. I even purchased one for my girlfriend who now puts it in to help with her insomnia. Great investment!",1201392000,2,464,4.602409638554217
8151471,1,B000JJR0RS,"I spend a lot of time outdoors, by the ocean or by mountain streams, so it was quickly obvious to me that the scenes on this video have been doctored. In most of the tracks, the foreground is very clearly ""pasted"" onto the background. For example, the birds on a beach in the foreground don't move at all while the ocean in the background does, and while there are bird noises implying moving birds. On one track the ocean waves appeared to have been speeded up. On another, the audio of a stream doesn't seem to match the sounds I would expect from the stream pictured.

This all stresses me out, actually, because it's so jarring to expect true-to-life nature and get something manmade; also, spending money for this unsatisfying video does not exactly promote calm. I do not recommend this if you are very familiar with the outdoors.",1189123200,14,836,4.610738255033557
8151472,5,B000JJR0RS,"I love the water and I love the different options and scenes this dvd provides.  Some of the scenes are from a warm climate and some from a colder one like here in Minnesota.  They remind me of Lake Superior which is where I like to visit, esp. in the fall.  Very soothing and relaxing to fall asleep to or just have on as background sound.",1184716800,,340,4.121212121212121
8151473,5,B000JJR0RS,I really enjoyed the fact that there were several different views to choose from. My 2 favorites are the fisheye one (Rocky Shores?) and the cold day one. Although the nature sounds are pretty cool I usually like to listen to them with the soft music track. The nature sounds are a bit too relaxing so I might watch that if I'm in bed getting ready to go to bed. Otherwise a great collection of views and nice relaxing music to kick back and unwind too.,1161302400,6,453,4.27906976744186
