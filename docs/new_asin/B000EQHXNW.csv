2529746,5,B000EQHXNW,"I've never been a Woody Allen fan.  I don't care much for films about neurotic people, especially autobiographies.  This movie proved to me there is a mature, talented soul hidden inside Allen and it really knows what goes on in the world.

This screenplay drags and can work better than a sleeping pill if you don't give it your undivided attention.  Premise is simple:  Uneducated tennis pro makes friends with rich guy, attracts rich guy's sister, gets taken under wing by rich guy's father, gets hots for rich guy's fiance, and spends most of movie worrying what to do about it.  But, don't touch that remote!  It'll get good, really good.

Allen has touched on a reality different from his other movies. This is actually far more entertaining than watching comedic or neurotic interactions which never seem to resolve to anyone's satisfaction.  While some people may find the ending of this film unsettling, the fact is, in our society luck is a major player in our lives.  I found the film highly plausible and very realistic.  Allen is right on.

Woody, you can get off the shrink's couch now.  You're cured!",1145059200,5,1115,4.774869109947644
2529747,3,B000EQHXNW,"Hmmm. I am still trying to decide whether I enjoyed this film or not. I enjoyed the human interactions and found I connected well with Allen's view on upper-class British life. Nola's comment ""It's such an inbred family"" summed it up well. In fact, I was really enjoying the film, for the first half at least. I could relate to Chris, a man who previously had nothing and then suddenly thrust into a family where money is of no concern at all. Then comes along a woman who makes him question that. I think that aspect of the story is intriguing. However, my trouble with it is how stupidly it is resolved. I shaln't give away any details, but really! I though I was watching a different film of a different genre, and I did not care for that. I kept wondering when the saga would end, and I have to say by the end I was glad it was over. I was left confused, slightly let down, and also amused that such a good beginning to a film ended so mechanically. Still, I enjoyed the overall apsect of it, and I am quite the Scarlet Johanson fan, so on that note I enjoyed it. Overall however, it was a so-so film for me, and not one I will see again in a hurry.",1144454400,12,1153,4.151785714285714
2529748,4,B000EQHXNW,"Woody Allen trades upper-crust Manhattan for filthy rich London, scratchy old jazz records for scratchy old opera records, and his trademark neurotic ""Woody Allen character"" for -- well, thankfully nobody... and while it ain't quite as bleak (or brilliant) as Interiors, there are no laughs (or even giggles) to be had. Match Point is an expertly crafted short story heavy on character development, dialogue, and exposition (but perhaps it's too talky for some -- five people left the theater before it was over.) I still don't understand what the big deal is about Scarlett Johansson -- sure, she's pretty but just so... vacant and distant or something. Otherwise, certainly the best thing Woody Allen has come up with in at least ten years.

Grade: B",1144022400,6,752,5.016
2529749,5,B000EQHXNW,"I first went into this movie expecting something along the lines of Unfaithful meets Fatal Attraction, but to my surprise, it was more like ... oh well, I won't spoil it for you guys :-)

Suffice it to say, this is one smart thriller/drama that takes the subjects of obsession, lust and betrayal to a different level. It's slow paced, like most European films, but it culminates with a big BAAAM.

2529750,5,B000EQHXNW,"this is a really good movie. it shows how luck is a very important part of ur life.  this movie was really great, very smart, not like anything u've ever seen before, the actors performances were amazing and i wonder why jonathan rhys meyers and scarlett johanson weren't nominated at the oscars. but i don't agree with some people, even though it was a great movie that u shouldn't miss, it still wasn't as good and touching and original as brokeback mountain",1142726400,,460,4.609756097560975
2529751,5,B000EQHXNW,"It's been said, but for a while one of the best filmmakers of the 20th century has been staggering with mediocre films not nearly up to his potential. But finally Allen has returned to the game with a subtle but perfectly done thriller which allows him to reinvent himself and discover new terrain like a brand new filmmaker.

Match Point offers a simple but powerful message that luck plays a huge part in everyday life which to a major extent is true. Luck plays a huge part in Chris Wiltons life when he gets a job as a tennis trainer at a fancy club and meets Tom the son of a rich business man. Tom invites Chris to an opera and he meets Chloe the sister of Tom. From there Chris and Chloe start to date and Chris a small and unwealthy man gets introduced to high society life. He's offered a high stakes job, a personal driver, etc, just to bring happiness into the life of Chloe.

Chris is perfectly content until he meets the beautiful Nola played by Scarlett Johansson. Nola is everything Chloe is not, exciting, extremely sexy, and unwealthy which leads to Chris's dilemma. Nola and Chris begin an affair that leads to even more once Tom dumps Nola and gives Chris the opportunity to live out all his sexual desires with a beautiful woman but the high life of Chloe overpowers the little ambitions and lack of money. Match Point is about luck but also about choices made in life for personal enjoyment. Is it better to be rich and not completely satisfied or poor and happy? As a failure, Chris finds luck with Chloe's rich family willing to set him up with whatever he desires.

The film is very similar to Woody's 1989 masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanors and it takes similar turns. Chris gets himself in the situation where he must choose from a small life with a woman he is satisfied and turned on by or choose a high society life with a woman he barely loves and lacks attraction to. I won't tell you what he chooses but I will tell you the dilemma leads Allen to his most satisfying, tense, engaging film in over a decade.

It's great to see Allen take such a simple premise used several times and put all his trademark qualities into it mixed with a discovery of new terrain. Match Point is an engaging, entertaining film that gives you a taste of the high life and shows you what it can lead a man to. 10-10 for this excellent film by the great Woody Allen.",1142467200,6,2376,4.405466970387244
2529752,4,B000EQHXNW,"At the heart of this movie lies a single question:  Is it better to be good or lucky?

Framing this question initially through a simple tennis metaphor, Woody Allen's film gradually expands its application to increasingly weightier matters.  And it is the many clever variations on this one theme that make this movie much more than a suspenseful drama.

The story line follows a former professional tennis player (played by Jonathan Rhys-Myers) as he climbs London's social ladder.  Self-made and incredibly charismatic, the audience can't help but like him at first, despite the calculating way in which he decides to marry into a wealthy British family notwithstanding his burning attraction to his future brother-in-law's girlfriend (played by Scarlett Johansson).

The pervasive use of opera as background music throughout the film both irritating and unnecessary, however, since the mounting sense of tragedy and drama comes through strongly enough thanks to the brilliant plotting and Hitchcock-like camera angles.

The ending, somewhat reminiscent of Allen's ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" answers the movie's central question in an unexpected way that's both appropriate and unsettling.",1141689600,3,1191,5.620111731843576
2529753,5,B000EQHXNW,"I totally agree with Nichols of L.A.  MATCH POINT was the best picture of 2005.  And why it wasn't nominated in every major category by the Academy Awards boggles the mind.  It was certainly better than BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, CRASH AND MUNICH.  (Those films lack the complexity of MATCH POINT.)  The only other film that came close to MATCH POINT's greatness was WALK ON WATER.",1141516800,8,400,4.739130434782608

And these are some sexy folks in an adultery and lust laden storyline, but it's not sexy and they're not credible. Some lines by each actor ring awkward and lack affect in their delivery, likely because they are so incongruent with what one might actually say. So here's where the embarrassment comes in: it's pretty close to what one feels for the comic bombing on stage.  Even the perversely constructed climax only fleetingly jostles the attention.

The plot takes a surprisingly sick twist, which shows you what truly stupid extremes some people are willing to go to after they have previously made poor choices.

Once again, he has reinforced his position as one of the handful of film-makers who could sustain a high level of quality through a good many pictures over a very long period of time.

2529802,3,B000EQHXNW,"Match Point was a disappointment to me, the kind of Woody Allen movie that makes even long-time fans want to go skittering back to the ""early, funny ones.""  What Allen has done is essentially gather up his well-known bag of ""serious"" thematic concerns and storytelling tropes and transpose them to London from New York.  The philandering husband -- the nagging wife -- the casual encounter in a retail district -- the insecurities born of social climbing -- the moral cost of ""having it all"" -- have all been done better before, particularly in CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, which this movie much resembles.  The cast, which includes Scarlett Johannson, is up to snuff, but not enough is asked of them.  Due to the lukewarm treatment of material Allen himself has rendered trite, and the almost complete absence of humor, this one is for Allen completists only.

2529834,4,B000EQHXNW,"Chris Wilton a tennis trainer, who played against Henman, Rusedski, and Agassi, at an exclusive club in London. He began instructing Tom Hewett to improve his game. When Chris was introduced to Tom's finance, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), an aspiring actress from Boulder, Colorado, there was instantaneous chemistry. Chloe was Tom's sister and she doesn't waste any time proposing marriage to Chris. Chris from a modest Irish background jumps at the chance to marry into wealth. He puts on an act making Chloe believe he was in love with her, when his sole interest was in Nola. Chris was preoccupied and resourceful in accompanying Nola alone for extracurricular activities. Chris impregnates Nola after Tom called off the wedding plans. Chris told Nola to have an abortion which she refused, having had two already. Chris felt backed into a corner, because he wasn't going to give up his luxurious lifestyle and settle for Nola. He had to hatch a plan to resolve the matter. Under the direction of Woody Allen, Johansson's performance is spot-on, flawless and she exudes appeal. She portrays the fiancee of a socialite in a setting that is sophisticated, classy, and elegant. The colloquy is smart, witty and progresses along quickly IMO.

The conversation is flatter than tennis courts at a country club, and the characters are the stockest of stock caricatures.  The winning cast members--including Emily Mortimer, Rupert Penry-Jones, Brian Cox, and Penelope Wilton--are wasted here.

The main character's solution for removing a major threat to his plushy lifestyle is so ridiculous it becomes inadvertently funny.

2529851,4,B000EQHXNW,"While watching Match Point I kept thinking: What movie does this remind me of? Oh yes,  A Place in the Sun  (1951 d. George Stevens, based on Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy). Allen  clearly used this movie as his inspiration but added a few twists and role reversals. This doesn't diminish Allen's work but only makes it more interesting. Well worth watching though much of the suspense is diminished if you've already seen A Place in the Sun; if you haven't, I'm sure the viewing experience is quite different.

Spoiler Alert!

In A Place in the Sun a young working class man (Montgomery Clift) gets a job working in his rich uncle's factory where he meets and has an affair with a young blond working class woman with pouty lips (Shelly Winters), whom he does not really love. In the meantime, he starts working his way up in his uncle's business and meets and falls obsessively in love with a rich and beautiful socialite (Elizabeth Taylor). However, the young blond with pouty lips becomes pregnant and demanding. Well young blond winds up dead (is it an accident or murder?) and young man ends up in the electric chair.

In Match Point a young working class man (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) meets rich socialite (Emily Mortimer) and gets a job working in her father's business. They marry though he doesn't really love her. In the meanwhile he meets young blond working class woman with pouty lips and falls obsessively in love with her (Scarlett Johansson). However, the young blond with pouty lips becomes pregnant and demanding. Well young blond winds up dead (we know it's not an accident) and young man gets away with it.

So the only suspense for me in Match Point was figuring out who was going to get murdered: rich socialite or working class blond, and whether he was going to get away with murder.",1384128000,3,1814,4.703470031545741

2529857,5,B000EQHXNW,"in this film allen has gone back to his earlier dilemma from crimes and misdemeanors where he wondered whether someone could commit a great crime and then go on with his life as if nothing had happened. the step further is his exploration of random chance and luck in one's life.  he posits that if one is lucky in life, one can live the good life even though he shouldn't be able to do so.

his characters for this exposition are Jonathan rhys-myers (from THE TUDORS tv series) as a handsome, charming and cultivated man who sets out to marry a very wealthy bride.  he is an excellent tennis player and that is his way of meeting the family and worming his way into it. his target woman has a brother and this brother has a fiance played by scarlett johanssen. he is very attracted to her but he cannot ""waste"" himself on her as she has no money.

that is the set up and we do indeed go back and forth with these characters just like a hotly contested tennis game.  it becomes very hitchcockian, the most so of any allen film. thus this is not a comedic film. although most of his films have some comic element, this one has none so as to keep the suspense and tension up for the hitchcock like exposition.

i really liked it but it is definitely a change of pace for Allen except for his musings about the factor of luck in living our lives.

2529861,1,B000EQHXNW,"For the first hour I wasn't sold on Match Point. Everyone gave okay performances but it dragged on and on. Every scene felt drab and boring, and the pacing was slow and painful, even for a character driven film. However, no character was particularly likeable, which defeats the whole objective of a character driven film. Around the one hour mark, events begin to gain some sort of plot with an announcement from Nola, the woman the main character Chris is having an affair with. Suddenly, the plot seemed to gain some sort of momentum and excitement, and for one moment I looked forward to each scene and hoped that questions would be answered.

Sadly, this build up keeps on soaring until it reaches a point towards the end which seems completely different from what happened before it. Very little development went into the character to explain their actions, which could have made a bit of sense. Without it, the execution, as with much of the film, was dull and unexciting.

With only a good mid-section, which lasts all of twenty minutes, Match Point, for me, is a two hour drag that tries to be a character driven film without any likeable or believable characters.",1374710400,4,1173,4.745098039215686

2529863,1,B000EQHXNW,"I wonder - did Woody Allen think that so few people saw ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" that he decided to make it again, thinking that no one would notice? Or was this his version of Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"" which had already been done with director George Steven's ""A Place in the Sun""? It certainly wasn't Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" which he alluded to several times in the film. ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" was a much better movie and one of his best. And the comparisons to Hitchcock? What is that about? No comparison at all. All the elements that Hitchcock was known for - creating suspense with his camera work and music, creating wonderful chemistry between his actors, and the humor, were lacking in Match Point. I think this movie shows that Mr. Allen has run out of inspiration.",1372636800,8,798,4.7898550724637685
2529864,5,B000EQHXNW,I love this movie; brilliant script by Woody Allen and fantastic acting by all lead characters!  It's a great thriller; and it's sexy and interesting.  What I loved so much is that in the beginning they talked about a tennis match and that moment when the ball either goes over the net the way you want it to or it doesn't.  And then with the ring at the end they tie that all together; and you realize that luck can happen to a person in an instant..or not.  It's just a matter of which way the wind blows.

Annie Hall makes you want to visit NYC. Midnight in Paris makes you want to fly off to Paris. This one will make you dream of London. The cities are always the top stars in Woody Allen films.

You can read what the movie is about from the other reviewers. I'm just going to tell you that it is a good movie with an unexpected twist towards the end. This isn't really one of WA's light romantic comedies. ScarJo shows that she CAN act by playing a young American in London trying to pursue an acting career.

I was completely surprised by it because I expected to see an orignal screen play not a re-make of a movie that was made in the early 1950's with a young Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift - A Place In The Sun.  Both movies are good however, A Place In The Sun is excellent.

I had the same experience when I watched and thoroughly enjoyed Sharkey's Machine with Burt Reynolds.  Its an action packed, macho as only Burt can be remake of Laura with Gene Tierney from the 1940's.

2529879,1,B000EQHXNW,"Yeah, this movie is B-A-D. The writing is awful, I dislike the cast as much as the characters they play (except Scarlett Johanson who is actually miscast).

The characters are completely unrelatable. They just whine about their dispairing lives despite being the upper class. My heart bleeds for these characters.

These characters are like bad characterisations of English people. London is beautifully shot. Except where are the ""Gangstas""? London is a notorious heckhole. These guys are one step away from saying ""Pip, pip"" and eating scones.

To sum up, the film plays out as if written and directed by a giddy socialite drinking too much wine. Well let me tell you something, Andrew Ryan isn't a giddy socialite who can be slapped around by government muscle. And with that, farewell, or dasvidaniya, whichever you prefer.

SEMI-FINAL NOTE: People are afraid to face how great a part of selecting a film is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control. There are moments in life when the film hits the rim of the bin, and for a split second, it can either go forward or fall back. With a little luck, it goes forward, and you win. Or maybe it doesn't, and you lose. Well actually no, I'll just bin it again.

Woody Allen is a genius. He has made both a film and a fine piece of kindling. Seriously though, this is his longest film to date, and it is good fortune I'm getting this one out the way.

I'm off to watch ""Drive"", a good movie.

But the plot pace is glacial even for me, the story predictable and the themes and characters inconsistent.  The tennis touches are largely forgotten a third of the way in, Jonhansson's character develops unevenly and in jumps, and there are several glaring plot holes as things progress.  There was some question as to how things would end, but by then most of my interest had fled and the resolution was flat regardless.

I am not very familiar with the works of Woody Allen and thus could not compare this with his other films.  If that's part of the appeal I could be missing something, but overall for me Match Point unfortunately turned out rather disappointing.",1339286400,,942,4.819875776397516

This is a Woody Allen movie so incestuous little love triangles are only to be expected.

  What begins as your classic Man Marries a Rich Girl and Then Takes a Mistress movie eventually becomes something much more sinister. This is no Bridges of Madison County. In Match Point, a woman does not get to have mind-blowing, adulterous sex with her lover and then just walk away from it all in the end.

  This movie does not have a sympathetic protagonist by any means.  Chris is an absolutely loathsome human being, and the very ending may come as a bit of a disappointment to many.  But you know, I liked this movie anyway.  I can't even explain why I liked it.  It was just so twisted, and I like twisted movies.

I am in complete agreement with the other 1-star reviewers who saw this movie as a predictable and dreadful waste of time, and I am a Woody Allen fan...well, up until now anyway. I really don't know what to make of how bad this film is. I found its inane dialogue and predictable plot pushing the limits of my patience to the point where I could not bear it long enough to watch through to the ending, even while fearing I would miss some big surprise at the end that would justify sitting through it.

Although many reviewers liked Johansson's performance, I felt that after the initial scenes she became much less interesting and seemed to change personality in the second half of the film, transforming from a sensuous, somewhat mysterious and quiet character into a shrill shrew, unable as an actor to rise above the mediocre dialogue and action.

The character of Chris has to be one of the stupidest murderers ever, incapable of realizing how easily found out he would be after leaving clues all over the place, revealing to a friend his desperation over his situation, placing the murder weapon back in the rack in his wife's family home, etc etc.

I normally enjoy the way Woody Allen makes use of music in his films, but the repetitiveness of the same pieces - on scratchy old records - became annoying and intrusive and often did not make sense behind the action.

Scarlett Johansson, who is a beautiful woman, was so not convincing in this movie. In fact, her character was the of the worst in the film. The lead actor, Jonathan Rhys Myers was a close second. The opera-tennis combo theme (which was odd to say the least) did nothing for the story. After the first 30 minutes, all tennis playing was over. The operas and opera music was far too stylish for such a bland group of actors. None of them captured the sleek, seductive, and risky behavior their characters displayed.

2529889,4,B000EQHXNW,"My review is of the movie itself and not of the specifics of the DVD presentation per se (I haven't watched the DVD yet, but bought it to keep, as it was on sale for a good price and I had liked the movie a lot)

Had I not known before I saw this movie that it was a Woody Allen's, I probably could not have guessed it. To me, it was a strong departure from Allen's style of the previous 3 decades.

The ""day-to-day"" interaction of the characters is very interesting. It makes one think deeply about the characters' motivations, and about the interactions between their ""ideals"", their needs, their perceptions of the practicalities of their lives, and their survival instincts. As the various characters are in very different situations, and as some are ""good"" and others are ""not"", really ? ,  ""survival"" can be a bit relative here.

But more important, without giving away too much of the plot, is how interesting the way Woody Allen drives the underlying theme, of how much randomness (or ""luck"" if you prefer) there is in life, to an ""unconventional"" end.

When you watch the movie, note when the tennis ball hits the net and then ends on the one side of the court that it probably should not have. This is where the seed of the movie theme is planted. The build up of that theme continues in a subtle way as Allen weaves it in the ""day-to-day"" interaction of the characters, which in itself, as I said, I found very interesting. That theme continues to the ""unconventional"" end of the movie. This is not how movies are ""supposed"" to end. It is ""unfair"" that ""match point"" goes to the undeserving.

This is a critical look at the random component in our lives that is not usually looked at in this manner, perhaps because it offends our sensibilities to think that in reality some match points do go to thoes who ""should not"" win.",1301097600,4,1835,4.495495495495495
2529890,4,B000EQHXNW,"The movie is a tragic opera played out on film.  All the clues to the movie's themes of luck, lust, ambition, wealth, and tragedy are set in place in the first fifteen minutes of the movie.  Once the stage is set the celluloid opera unfolds, nicely complemented by old mono operatic soundtracks.

The movie's tension builds slowly toward the conclusion, even getting uncomfortable at times in a darkly comedic manner.  There are enough misdirections and surprising twists that my wife and I made several involuntary exclamations, often cracking up afterwards.  The movie held our attention right to the end, not out of any sense of greatness, more out of a manipulated sense of morbid curiousity.  One can't help but try and make predictions as the end nears, but unless someone told you of the conclusion, you won't be right.

Once the movie is over we felt no need to watch it again.  We chose instead to cast it to our friends and family, telling them to watch it then pass it along, encouraging the recipients to do the same.  ""Match Point"" is definitely worth watching once.

2529893,5,B000EQHXNW,"This has one of the neatest bits of stage business you are likely to ever see in a movie.  Keep your eye the ball (or ring) as it hits the net, or perhaps a railing.  Whether it falls forward or backward can make all the difference in the world.

I can't believe that tennis players say the same thing that poker players say: ""I'd rather be lucky than good.""  Poker players say that because there is a significant element of chance involved in any given hand; and besides they already think they're good.  It is the other guy who is lucky.

Jonathan Rhys-Meyers stars as Chris Wilton, a poor Irish boy on the make.  He is handsome, charming, smart, and a very good tennis player who is candid about not quite being good enough against the very best.  He gets a job teaching tennis at an exclusive English club and quickly meets and charms a very rich student (Matthew Goode as Tom Hewitt) who has a sister (Chole, played by Emily Mortimer) who finds him irresistible.

Well, how lucky can you get?  Complication: Scarlett (the sexiest woman on earth, at one time, anyway, according to some magazine) Johansson playing Nola Rice, who is seriously dating the very eligible Tom Hewitt.  (You could say she's on the make as well.)  She's an American would-be actress who can't quite wow them at the auditions in London.  She is sitting pretty however because if she marries Tom she will be set for life.

I could go on, but the plot is so delicious that I don't want to spoil it for you.  It's a variation on the venerable theme of rake's progress, employing in an interesting way the old adage, ""The man who marries for money earns it.""  I have only one criticism of this especially well directed effort from the redoubtable Mr. Allen: you could have done without that cheesy ghost or hallucination scene near the end, involving sweet lips Scarlett and her neighbor.

See this for Woody Allen, who is just as smooth with this upscale noir/Hitchcockian thriller as he is with his renowned comedic and satirical efforts.  And to think the guy will be 75 in December.

Allen is to be congratulated on a very fine piece of work. Some reviewers have commented that the middle of the film is somewhat slow, but personally I found the entire thing to be perfectly paced and judged, each element setting up the next in careful succession. The last fifteen minutes, with the ""will he be found out?"" theme, was perhaps a little less than this film deserved, but it's the only slight flaw in an otherwise outstanding story.

2529900,4,B000EQHXNW,"Director/Writer: Woody Allen
Release Date: January 20, 2006
Genre: Psychological drama
Runtime: 2 hours, 5 minutes
Locations: London and the English countryside

THE PLOT: Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is an ex-tennis pro from Ireland and Nola (Scarlett Johansson) a struggling sultry actress from Colorado; both are (unconscious?) social climbers attempting to marry into a rich English family. Chris marries Chloe (Emily Mortimer) even though he passionately lusts for Nola, the latter whom ultimately breaks from the family and the UK. When she returns to London Chris reignites their passion, which can only lead to tragedy. And only luck can save him.

""Match Point"" is the antithesis of the modern 'blockbuster' and all it's moronic trappings -- there's no quick editing, no CGI, no goofy one-liners, no explosions and no promise of $400 million at the box office. No, ""Match Point"" is movie-making based simply on good writing and cinematic storytelling. The first hour plays out like a nigh tedious drama but the second builds momentum like a snowball slowly morphing into an avalanche. Be forewarned, if you don't have the stomach for an hour of soap operatics avoid this movie. For those who do, however, ""Match Point"" is rewarding, unpredictable and original.

Underpinning the drama is the theme of luck. The film starts out with a tennis ball hitting the top of the net; at that point the ball will fall on one side of the net or the other, depending solely on the luck of the player. At first, this seems unrelated to the story, but wait till the end and you'll see everything connect. It's amazing how good writing & storytelling can create a 'Wow' reaction much more so than the most elaborate overkill action sequence with all its requisite cgi and explosions.

I sensed a somewhat sad emptiness in the characters; most of them are neither likable nor unlikable (although Chloe is super-sweet albeit naive), they're just human beings trying to find meaning and fulfillment despite their physical riches or lack thereof. Their innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of religious faith and they search for meaning in the secular world of Dostoevsky, Sophocles, the visual arts and Verdi's operas. Only the mother and main protagonist, Chris, come off unappealing; the mother is just annoyingly snobbish, whereas Chris is so blatantly selfish and flat (not to mention devious) I find it hard to believe any of the characters in the story would find him appealing, let alone worthy of marrying into the family and becoming a prominent part of the business. But this just reveals that they're out of touch with their ""spiritual compass.""

What's ironic is I strangely found myself rooting for Chris in the final act, which doesn't make sense since I'm completely opposed to his (lack of) character and what he does (I can't say more because I don't want to spoil the film). This testifies to Mr. Allen's greatness as a filmmaker. Or maybe I temporarily rooted for him because, regardless of the outcome, I realize no one ultimately ""gets away"" with anything in life -- lucky or not.

The love, I mean lust, scenes between Chris and Nola struck me as ultra-steamy and authentic. This is exactly how a man and woman in illicit passion would secretly go at it. Case in point: the 'rain scene' is potent. Needless to say, ""Match Point"" is a must for Scarlett Johansson fans.

As to the ""Fatal Attraction"" reference: No, you don't have to worry about psycho slasher clichs. ""Match Point"" is smarter and more subtle than that.

GRADE: A-

***SPOILER ALERT***

Someone offered this insight about the story: ""Tennis is a game designed by a creator with a set of rules. You win the point if the ball goes forward or lose the point if the ball falls back. The ring doesn't bounce forward across the other side and into the water and you immediately think Chris has lost the point and will be found out. But since life itself has no designer, and there are no true rules, it turns out that it was actually good luck for Chris because the ring was found by a bum with a history of petty theft and therefore he, not Chris, was thought to be the murderer.""

While this is an intriguing insight and legitimate interpretation, it doesn't rule out a Creator or the fact that there are intrinsic moral laws in the physical universe. For instance, if there are no such laws why does Chris almost have a nervous breakdown after committing the murders? After all, if no such laws exist then it's impossible to break them and meaningless to be upset about it if you do? Why does he see non-literal ghosts of the victims? Obviously he broke an ironclad moral law and was now experiencing the guilt thereof. Yes, luck worked in his favor at the end of the story and this is in line with the insight of one of the wisest persons who ever lived: ""I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all"" (Ecclesiastes 9:11).

Yet, this doesn't preclude the existence of God or that there will be a judgment day in the Supreme Court of the universe. As Christ said, ""There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.""

Simply put, the idea that evil people ""get away"" with their crimes is an illusion.",1258761600,,5563,4.69917864476386
2529901,5,B000EQHXNW,"Woody Allen in his long sojourn to London found a new genre for him, the suspense lust thriller, when he wrote and directed the superb film ""Match Point"" (2005) He also developed there the thriller ""Cassandra's Dream"" with Colin Farrell. With brilliant photography and gorgeous scenes of London he depicts the life of a tennis semi-pro Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a handsome devil with sensual lips, who volleys himself into a life of wealth married to Chloe, the daughter of a moneyed family presided over by father Brian Cox in a thankless role.
Chris is introduced into the family by a young man, Tom, something of a cad and a wastrel, to whom he's giving tennis lessons. The wealthy scion has a stunning girlfriend, Nola, (again with sensuous lips) a would-be actress (Scarlett Johansson). Unfortunately for Chris he falls insanely in love with the money-poor Nola.
His dilemma: Nola gets with child and wants Chris to leave wife Chloe. Danger! Danger! Danger! What is newly rich Chris going to do? Chris is a striver from Ireland who hasn't seen better days yet. At the beginning of the movie Chris is reading ""Crime and Punishment."" He and Nola are two of a kind, both schemers and opportunists. Nola says, ""You'll do very good for yourself unless you blow it."" Nola keeps a diary which chronicles her passionate affair with Chris.
 Most of the movie is taken up with the smoldering passions of Chris and Nola and his devious tricks to find time with his mistress. Suspense, Hitchcockian, keeps building in the film. Her neighbor, that staple of the West End stage, Margaret Tyzack, gets a quick view of Chris. Chris says, ""Faith is the path of least resistance.""
 The soundtrack has arias from famous operas, often old scratchy ones, that provide a brilliant backdrop to the action and maneuvering of Chris. The ending is full of twists and turns and some really clever bits. Luck plays an important role in Chris's life.
 One character at the end quotes Sophocles, ""To never having been born may have been the greatest boon of all.""
 With this movie Woody Allen opened up new territory and gave us a fine motion picture.",1247529600,,2130,4.795640326975477

2529913,4,B000EQHXNW,"A lot's been said, and I'll try not to repeat stuff. Woody's often made films as an homage to his favorite directors. Here he tackles Hitchcock, and though it's been referred to his ""big comeback"", he missed on many levels. Most importantly, Hitch never put so many unlikeable characters in the same film. One, maybe two were enough to keep a Hitchcock plot interesting. With the exception of Emily Mortimer (and maybe Brian Cox), I had no idea where Woody was going with this. Second, Hitchcock relied on music as an integral part of every scene. Woody wasn't as careful, and the score was as bland as the bleak London setting.  Scarlett Johansson was the requisite Hitchcock blonde, but Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was no Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart or Farley Granger or Joseph Cotton. I couldn't have cared less about him and really wasn't surprised that he behaved with such stupidity. Mr. Rhys-Meyers was certainly centered in his conviction of the character that the script required, but what can you do with a boringly written character? There was little room for him to grow. At the end, he was the same idiot as in the beginning. I guess I was waiting for some Hitchcockian revelation, a surprise...or something. The ending was also non-Hitchcockian, because he usually gave justice to the bad guys. No, this homage to Hitchcock fell flat for me, and Woody's cleverness escaped me. I thought ""Match Point"" was a routine thriller, with some fine performances (especially Emily Mortimer), but I'm not compelled to watch it again.

Later under strong pressure from Nola to leave his wife for her, he decides to murder Nola and stay with his wife and hide the secret of the affair he had.

Whats bothering me is that in the end he goes away with his murder. Nothing happens to him, and he doesn't get punished for either cheating on his wife or murdering Nola! Its so unfair that he becomes the winner in the end, but hey, maybe the movie wants us to believe that life is actually unfair.

2529917,3,B000EQHXNW,"Woody Allen, known more for his comedies, tries his hand at a crime drama here. However, some parts of the movie are not as believable as they could be. For example, in this age of DNA testing where even a hair is enough to tie a criminal to a murder, how the police don't find anything that makes Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) culpable to the crime is implausible. Moreover, Wilton's decision to kill Nola (Scarlett Johansson) comes as a bit drastic and extreme to the viewer. And a drug addict killing an old woman for a just a few medications in her bathroom cabinet is improbable. The movie is sprinkled with analogies to tennis which are good, but that's not good enough to give it more than 3 stars.",1228003200,,705,4.4728682170542635
2529918,4,B000EQHXNW,"The critical buzz about Woody Allen's latest film, Match Point, is that it's his best since (fill in the blank), and, to a degree, that's true. The last of his films to attain even a limited greatness was 1999's Sweet And Lowdown, with the magnificent performances of Sean Penn  and Samantha Morton, and the last flat out great Allen film was 1992's Husbands And Wives. But a case can be made that this film is his best since 1989's Crimes And Misdemeanors, the film which is its most obvious philosophic and narrative ancestor. That said, in a sense, this film is also sort of a `Best Of' Woody Allen film, which reuses many of the best scenes and motifs of his best work.
  There is the obvious nod to Crimes And Misdemeanors, in that this film follows a murderer who gets away with his crime of killing his mistress when she gets too clingy and demanding. But, there are nods to Interiors, with the end shot of the film, as the protagonist gazes out a window into a vacant sky, Annie Hall with the scenes of tennis, and several others. Also, as always, there is Allen's `grand idea' that propels the film; in this case another one he has used before, that of luck being the single greatest determinant in someone's success or failure writ small or large, not ethics.... Whether or not this terrific film signals a quality fluke, for Allen's stealing shamelessly from earlier great outings may belie a creative bankruptcy (although one could argue the reassemblage or collage is creative in its own right), or a renascent final Silver Age to bookend his Golden Age (1977's Annie Hall through 1992's Husbands And Wives), only the next few films will herald, but I'd love to see Allen stay away from New York for the next four or five films, and really push himself hard narratively, in a final creative burst. The editing of the film is very crisp, and at only about two hours, the film feels far longer and richer, in the best sense. The English countryside is also beautifully filmed by Allen newcomer Remi Adefarasin.
  As said, without Crimes And Misdemeanors' comedy, this film does not approach the universality of experience that film does (recall the philosopher in that film's documentary within a film, and his narration over the final wedding scenes), but it is still leagues above the usual crap Hollywood puts forth.",1221350400,,2330,4.700980392156863

I've never been a fan of Mr. Allen's overall body of work (although I do think that ""Annie Hall"" is a great American masterpiece), so I viewed this with no expectations whatsoever (one never knows what they'll get out of Scarlett Johannson).

I was pleasantly surprised with the pacing of the movie. It didn't rush, it didn't plod; it just kept a clipped tempo the entire time. I enjoyed the sweeping views of London from the loft, and the lushness of the Queen's Tennis Club where the main character, Chris Wilton (ably played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a tennis instructor.

The issue with this film is that it didn't have the darkness of characterization of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" Matt Damon's portrayal of Ripley as a scheming, manipulative, charming, murdering sadist is far superior to Rhys Meyers' very polite, ingratiating Wilton.

Another problem is Scarlett Johannson as Nola Rice. I enjoy many of Ms. Johansson's films, but this was NOT a favorite of mine. She spent far too much time blowing smoke out of the side of her mouth (literally) and screeching like a howler monkey to be believable (the last 1/3 of the movie attests to this).

2529928,4,B000EQHXNW,"The title of this film is ""Match Point"" which refers to the main character, Chris Walton's profession as a former professional tennis player. It also refers to chance or luck and how luck may direct our destiny and course of action. I also think the term Match Point may refer to Woody Allen playing a game that Patricia Highsmith plays so well in ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""The Amazing Mr. Ripley"" which is the game of determining under what conditions and stresses might an ordinary person commit a terrible murder.

The character of Chris Walton, played beautifully by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, is certainly typical of Highsmith. He is the handsome but talented man of humble beginnings who seeks the finer things in life and will actually reach the point where he will kill to maintain his lifestyle. He is coldly calculating with many social skills and a bright intellect. Thus when ultra-rich Chloe Hewett falls in love with him, he is only too obliging to be seduced and to marry this pleasant and gentle heiress. Yet he is driven by passion and obsession for his brother-in-law's girlfriend, Nola Rice, played perfectly by Scarlett Johansson.

The film does a good job of demonstrating how hot passions may come and go and are rarely the basis for sound decision making.

This is a different pattern than was seen in Theodore Dressler's An American Tragedy, though there are similar plot devices. In An American Tragedy, a young poor man is offered romance with a beautiful rich girl if only he did not have a pregnant girlfriend at the time. This is pure Highsmith since it is the desperations, the calculations, the lack of guilt, the cool cover-up, and the final lack of remorse that makes Chris more akin to Ripley.

Woody tries to throw us off the track by having Chris read Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and then refer to this book several times throughout the film. Woody even has the crime of passion involve an innocent land lady like is seen in Crime in Punishment. But the consciousness of Woody's main character is more Highsmith than Dostoevsky. He is sophisticated evil residing in a man of grace and beauty.

The plot is well constructed and logical yet never reveals too much. The viewer is really not sure how Chris will decide between his pregnant wife and his pregnant mistress or how he will work himself out of the terrible mess he has created. Woody creates a building tension and apprehension as the film moves to an unexpected climax.",1200182400,,2467,4.768149882903981

Within 30 minutes the  characters have definitively sealed themselves as one-dimensional cardboard bores.  For 90 minutes one keeps hoping that a twist of plot, a stunningly revealed detail, or a leap forward in portraiture will propel the film out of first gear.  Nothing happens.

The dialogue is predictable, but when predictable dialogue is poorly written, the viewer's agony is increased.  The world knows Woody Allen can be a clever conversationalist, but in this film only a few of Penelope Wilton's lines are truly amusing.

Of the several inept effects that produced inadvertent laughter, a particularly annoying feature was the placement of random Italian opera arias as background music.  Was this designed to add ""sophistication"" to the film in light of several characters' expressed fondness for opera?  The effect, at an intellectual level one might expect in a freshman film major project, fell flat.  Musical excerpts from Bellini's  ""La Sonnambula"" would have been most appropriate for the sleep-walking pace of this non-film.",1198195200,13,1125,5.445086705202312

2529956,3,B000EQHXNW,"I think the main problem with this movie is that they tried to give it such a stiff, British air, but the entire thing came across as being very staged and wooden. Prime offender is the lead actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who is a very pleasing-looking young man, but certainly not the kind of person who can shoulder the weight of one entire film (I recently watched him in the miniseries ""Gormenghast"" where he was the lead and he suffered similar problems there too).

Scarlett Johansson, who is now officially the muse of Allen, turns up every now and then looking all Scarletty, pout and all. Let me say this - the role is NOT a stretch for the actress as I suspect this is how she is in real life too. Also, I especially had a problem with the supposed sex scenes between Meyers and Johansson - they were lifeless, passionless and it looked like both the actors were really trying to get into one another without much success (it actually looked like a gay man and a lesbian woman trying to hit it off - you can imagine THAT!).

The secondary characters play their parts a whole lot better. But thats a pity because most of the screen time is wasted on the leads. What IS good about this, is that the dialogue is impeccable. Not groundbreaking, mind you, but certainly a cut above the rest, to be sure. Allen is great at this sort of thing, I only wish he would get over his obsession with Scarlett and give parts to other, more deserving actresses. All she has is amazing beauty, but I hardly think shes a talented actress (unless biting your lips and giving men come-hither looks is your definition of acting).

The tennis allegories and innuendoes also tend to wear thin after a point, and the 'chilling ending' was pretty much an afterthought (the lead actor kills his pregnant girlfriend and escapes unscathed). I also didn't quite understand the 'passionate relationship' between him and his girlfriend played by Scarlett, as they seemed very 'not into each other'. A severe problem of bad casting one might say.

In a film where the leads are supposed to carry the movie forward, this was an exercise in futility, as neither was there much to write home about, nor is Jonathan Rhys Meyers capable of handling such a demanding role with the precision it deserves (notice the scenes where he needs to look smouldering and brazen - he only looks girlish and confused, not to mention coy and retiring). His great beauty apart, this was a hollow performance.

Woody Allen is a great writer and film-maker, but I think that 'Scoop' that came after this was definitely a far superior film. His films exist in a parallel, almost theatrical universe and this might be a bit too convoluted for some audiences, and here the message and delivery is a bit lost. Gorgeously shot though. England has never looked this inviting.",1190678400,2,2822,4.624750499001996
2529957,5,B000EQHXNW,"This story is superbly staged and performed. I cannot reveal the surprise ending; but I can point to a brief line of conversation in the movie that
not only defines Mr Allen's fascination with a very dark side of our human nature, but also defines the age, the era, and  the moral malaise in which we have  all found ourselves. This is precisely what makes this movie and script a timeless classic that will be played in the next generation for what it reveals about all of us. This IS the definition of ""Art""....a visual image that accurately portrays, reveals, and identifies the particular fashions and social mores of a given culture in history. Just as we would look at an artifact and say, ""Oh this is from ancient Egypt"". Folks will one day pick up this movie and say ""Oh this was from ancient America""

The conversation goes something like this: Rhys Myers is a tennis coach who finds himself catapulted into wealth thanks to the sweetest gal on earth, played by Emily Mortimer, who falls in love with him right off; and remains hapless and loyal, while Rhys himself is tragically attracted to the femme fatale in the script played by the comely Scarlett Johansson. Before this, however, it is revealed that Rhy's ..father?..""Lost his legs and found Jesus"". To which Rhy's future brother in law, the other poor little rich boy, brother of  classically sweet Emily...replies, apologetically, that ""It doesn't seem like a fair trade"".  It is then remarked , words to the effect, ""...that it is said that all life came about as an accident. That there is no right or wrong"".

This is the literary epicenter around which this ill fated romance turns. But beyond that....it is the moral focal point around which the entire western world revolves. For this reason, this movie will be one that will be shown generations from now - which may well be used in classrooms to provide some clue as to ""What happened to the once great nation of America?  Is this then, dear students, where it all went horribly wrong for those wretched souls?""

Humans by nature, have aspirations to lift themselves and their lifestyles above what they grew up in. Some do it through hardwork while others seek easier means. In a more family oriented society, marrying into a higher strata of society (while not always acceptable) is a means of doing that.

More often than not we learn from our mistakes but for that we need that element of luck which will let our mistakes slide. That forms a core element in this movie.

This is not a movie where the Woody Allen style is splashed across the pages. His style is content being the subtext to the story.

Jonathan Rhys-Meyers steals the show with his beautifully understated performance. The zealousness to rise in life couples with a deep sense of vulnerabilty to make the character of Chris Wilton truly memorable.

Same is true for Scarlett Johnansson. The seductiveness is just a cloak over the inner struggles of a girl trying to build a career and find love. Nola Rice like many young women clings to blind hope that maybe her married lover would be hers someday. Very few actresses these days are as talented as Miss Johansson.

2529961,5,B000EQHXNW,"Being known as Woody Allen's comeback film is not an easy title to carry, but `Match Point' lives up to its title every second of screen time.  It's sexy and tense, expertly paced and tightly scripted.  `Match Point' is, for lack of a better word, perfect.  The film flows so evenly and keeps your interest throughout, and actually is able to catch the viewer off guard in the final act of the film by expertly crafting a script that disguises itself very well.  That's not to say that the film isn't mysterious from the very beginning; it's dark and ominous in a very discreet and subtle way.  The chemistry between the entire cast is rock solid as well, from Jonathon Rhys Meyers to the every scrumptious Scarlett Johansson, and adds layer upon layer to the understanding and ultimate climax of the film.

The story follows Chris Wilton, played by Rhys Meyers, who marries into wealth when he finds the beautiful Chloe Hewett, played by Emily Mortimer.  Everything seems to be going well for Chris, a former tennis pro turned business man by his new father in law.  He has a beautiful apartment, a beautiful wife and a well paying job, and then walks in Nola Rice, fianc&eacute;e to Chloe's brother Tom.  Nola is sexy, she's confident and she's everything Chris has ever wanted in a woman, but she's taken, and so is he.  Slowly though the two of them begin to test the waters of chastity and fidelity, and then when Nola is dumped by Tom she becomes fair game for Chris and the two fall deep into a passion they've never experienced before.

Problems arise though when Nola decides she's tired of being the `other woman'.  She's convinced that Chris loves her and not his wife and is determined to have Chris all to herself.  Chris is plagued with decision.  Should he leave his wife and his easy life, all his newfound wealth for a woman who can only offer him passion?  Should he stay with his wife and forsake his heart's desire?  If he stays with his wife how can he convince Nola to stay quiet or, better yet, go away?  The film takes a twist I personally didn't see coming and leaves you somewhat breathless in its raw delivery.

The acting here is superb.  Scarlett Johansson is a scene stealer as the delicious Nola Rice.  She's very aware of her sexuality and uses it as a weapon against Chris but more importantly against the audience.  Johansson was the perfect choice for the other woman because it's very believable that any man would be drawn to her regardless of the life they are leading.  Jonathon Rhys Meyers is also excellent in this film.  His performance is very detailed.  You can read the constant uneasiness in his face, the constant overwhelming concern about his actions.  Emily Mortimer is also fantastic, albeit very sorely underused.  Her few key scenes are effective, but she's not given enough of a chance to develop her character.  Woody Allen also directs this masterpiece so evenly.  His script is tight, his editing is fantastic and the finished product is one to watch again and again.  And have I mentioned that London, being the backdrop, is effortlessly captivating and a perfect mood setter!

If a well paced and thought provoking thriller is what you're looking for then `Match Point' may just be the film you need to see.  It'll keep you at the edge of your seat throughout and is sure to please anyone in your company.  It's edgy, it's sexy and it's intense.  I still don't quite understand the rating though.  The film is PG-13 at best.  The sexuality is mild, nothing you couldn't watch on television, and the violence is mostly off camera.  `Match Point' delivers scene after scene and remains one of my favorite films of 2005, one of the most surprising, the most entertaining and the most rewatchable films in recent years.",1184112000,2,3774,4.665151515151515
2529972,5,B000EQHXNW,"This was a very un-Woody Allen movie, many people said.  I would have to agree, as it takes place in London rather than his native New York.  Yet, it had some very valid points that I didn't consider until the plot got rolling.

Johnathan Rhys-Meyers plays Chris, a tennis pro who is looking to establish himself.  After landing a job as a tennis pro at an English country club, he meets Tom, a member, and the two become friends despite their social standig.  Eventually his sister, Chloe, falls for him and the two begin seeing each other.  Chris, however, developes an infatuation with Nola (Scarlette Johansen), Tom's girlfriend.  The two of them are outsiders to Tom and Chloe's family (a borish American actress and a tennis pro), but Chris is accepted as they see him as having potential while Nola is looking to hitch her wagon to wealth and privilage.  Chris would prove himself to be such a man as well, but it will reveil itself as the movie progresses.  Nola and Chris will have one encounter, but she disappears once Tom and her split.  Months later, she reappears after Chris and Chloe are married, and they take up with the affair once again.

Chris changes during this time.  While he is first seen as an all around ""nice guy"" who made a mistake with Nola, he shows another side of himself.  He is concerned with social climbing, wanting the wealth and privilage of the Hewitt family.  He is bored being married to Chloe, but realizes she is part of his all too important image.  He's married to the boss's daughter, he's being groomed to fill the old man's place someday, and he needs a wife and family to add to his all too important image.  He tries to juggle both women at the same time, but finds Nola is demanding more and more of his time.  Eventually, he devises a plot to eliminate Nola all together once she gives him an ultimatum - run off with me or I'll tell everyone you got me pregnant.  He murderes Nola, makes it look like a burglary, and, strangely enough, gets away with it even though he's questioned by the police with a telltale diary.

What does this say about human nature?  Funny how our needs and wants change with circumstance.  Chris wants the beautiful bombshell, then once he gets her he doesn't want what he's got.  Nola resists her urges for Chris when she is with Tom, but once she gives in she seems to have no qualms about their affair and wants more from him.  Tom wants a gorgeous, exciting woman like Nola, but disposes of her to marry a more respectable woman in the end.  And look at all the people who fell in line with the plot who suffered (the neighbor lady in Nola's apartment building).

2529975,1,B000EQHXNW,"How, as a Londoner, to handle the extreme cognitive challenge that is ""Match Point""? Let's try....

A favourite TV ad airing in the UK features a young swain bringing his girl home after a date and kissing her lips, only to retch on the taste of the Marmite she has secretly been eating. The very-postmodern makers of Marmite cleverly play on the average Brit consumer's knowledge that ""you either love it or hate it"" and are grown-up-enough to positively delight in confronting rejection.

And so with Woody Allen. Much has been written about him as an ""acquired taste"" and, certainly after 20 years of wrestling with acquiring it, one can see that the self-styled-tortured-yet-somehow-loveable-New-York-intellectual persona has its attractions when presented in a home milieu (e.g. Annie Hall, Manhattan) or as a comic abstraction (e.g. Everything You Always... , Bananas).

However, ""Match Point"" forces us to remember the reviewer who once said ""If ever the proverbial barrel were found to have a false bottom, this would be discovered lurking thereunder"".

Where to begin? As a Brit, but lover of all things New Yorker, I really wanted this to be a clever take on English manners; perhaps a postmodern riff on the old Ealing comedies staple about getting away with murder over a nice cup ot tea, or a homage to early (Gainsborough) Hitchcock. Unfortunately what Woody delivers is a - well - wooden assemblage of faux-Brit leads supported by some surprisingly distinguished Brit actors who should have had the professional maturity to recognise a tin-eared script when they first read it, and refuse a part in this nonsense. The only (though considerable) redeeming feature is Scarlet Johanssen, whose performance uniquely rises above the confines of a headachingly-dreadful script, to deliver something approaching a compelling account of character.

One feels short-changed: Years of critical acclaim lead one to expect ""Woody Allen as sharp social observer"". What he delivers is neither sharp, nor dramatically credible, nor even, come to think of it, particularly observant of any species of real people interacting, whether English, American or any other.

The reviewer who talked up the ""exciting twist"" is probably thinking of the one shot, heavily trailed and bloated with self-satisfied symbolism, when a piece of evidence of a murder hangs, literally, in a balance between discovery and oblivion. This could only be found ""suspenseful"" if one had slept through the first three reels (a distinct possibility, of course).

This is one of only a handful of films which has ever forced me to consider walking out of the theatre. We watched it to the end, through gritted teeth, in the expectation - ultimately disappointed - that the plot might deliver some justification for having appropriated our eyeballs for two hours.

I am, of course, prey to prejudice here simply by being a Londoner, reviewing a film made by a New Yorker, but the London of ""Match Point"" is about as credible as the New York of ""GhostBusters"". Save your money and treat your eyeballs to a decent piece of entertainment - like, perhaps, ""Howl's Moving Castle"", which is altogether more satisfying and (alarmingly enough) more credible.

Ms Johanssen's presence is the only reason to buy this film at all: A heroic and quite watchable attempt to give life to a character built entirely of recycled cardboard but whose ""back story"" circumstances at least offer an intelligent actor some basis for between-the-lines character development. For the sake of her career I hope she is not misled by any further specious offers of big-name collaboration - she is capable of so much better than this and in any case already has triple-A arthouse credentials after ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"". And Mr Allen - as a professional introspect, surely you should be more aware of playing to your strengths and knowing your natural limits? - pleeeease stick to what you do best and give us more footnotes on New York life. (There was a rumour that ""Match Point"" was originally going to be made in the USA; if so this may be a plausible excuse for the movie's complete lack of any local idiom. It doesn't excuse its other failings.)

Oh, and Marmite is (allegedly) made by scraping the dregs of brewer's yeast out of the bottom of fermenting vats. So maybe it's a fair analogy.",1182470400,28,4369,5.0304287690179805

""Match Point"" is a delicate and elegant thriller that has kept me tied to my chair expectantly for its ultimate resolution. The movie has a particular style, very much a-la Hitchcock but still faithful to Allen's own genius. Consistent with Allen's work in NYC, the city of London plays a starring role in the movie and is funny to see how an American director ends up making such a beutiful portrait of a city not quite praised by its own children. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers delivers an impressive performance as the ambitious and young American tennis promise who relocates to London in search of success and ends up marrying the daughter of a wealthy entrepeneur. The marriage means not only financial stability but also the opportunity to step into the rigid upper class London. However, things start to fall apart when he falls madly in love with Nola (Scarlett Johansson), an aspiring actress also struggling her way into the rich and famous.

Both Chris and Nola share similarities in that they are outsiders, trying to break into the Hewett's traditionalist, English upper class world view (and Allen, the Jewish New Yorker, portrays this world with superb accuracy, right down to the fine nuances of the class system - such as the food you order, and conversational patterns at the dinner table). Chris plays his cards right - dating Chloe, marrying her, and finding a lucrative job in his father in law's company, with opportunity for career development. Nola, on the other hand, is alienated by Eleanor Hewitt's snobbish distain for her acting ambitions. Chris, taking advantage of her uncertainty, her vulnerability, begins a passionate affair with Nola while he is married to Chloe. Nola is dumped by Tom, who marries another woman, more suited to his well bred family mating strategy, and leaves the country.

She returns to Britain and bumps into Chris while he is visiting the Tate Modern with his wife - another instance of luck, and Chris rekindles the affair, with greater lust and passion. Predictably, he becomes torn between the two women in his life - the sweet, good natured, and well bred Chloe (Emily Mortimer - who plays a difficult and important role very skilfully) who is desperate for a baby and also holds the key to the wealthy privileges Chris enjoys from the Hewetts, and the tempestuous actress Nola whom he loves with great passion but knows he can have no stable future with. How to resolve this? the path Chris resolves on, in the spirit of Dostoyevsky (note that in a key scene at the start of the novel he reads Crime and Punishment with an accompanying guide to the novel) is a Russian denoument full of dark nights of the soul, existentialist torment and deep issues of morality. The plot twists at the end are cleverly worked out, I won't reveal the tantalising conclusion, but be assured that the image at the start of the movie of a tennis ball slapping into the net chord and hovering tantalisingly in the air, the viewer uncertain which side of the net it will fall on, is a key image reprised later in the film.

And more generally, how does Match Point, a rare departure from his native side of the Atlantic, compare with the rest of Allen's work. I agree with the general consensus that Match Point represents a late period renaussance for Allen, continuing the good work from Melinda and Melinda. It is clever, well written and slickly plotted. The acting is generally first rate. One thing missing for me though: the laughs. Allen must have gone to herculean efforts to supress his natural bountiful intelligent wit in order to set a comedy amongst the modern British Upper classes who these days are not so much eccentric non-conformists as simply very very boring, having to work long hours in boring city jobs as the only way of viably maintaining their Belgravia houses and country estates. This film reflects this well, since not one of the characters has so much of a trace as a sense of humour. It is an excercise in massive self restraint on the part of all the actors. The only one who lets off steam is Scarlett Johansson when she becomes hysterical as Chris prevaricates about leaving his wife. Come on Woody - you seem to know the British Upper classes so well: even the stiffest of upper lips has to wobble sometimes and give way to a giggle every now and then, otherwise they would be driven completely nuts - which is what actually happens to the protagonist in this movie! Ah, well, it all fits into place somehow.",1180224000,,4417,4.771241830065359

Woody Allen has used the elements of ""Crime and Punishment"" to create a mainstream of events that intertwine with his recurring themes.. yet unlike Dovstoyesky's great novel, there is no redemption here, and that is part of the message

Opera plays a significant role here, almost as another actor as well.

Facing reality as it is, this handsome tennis player, who has accepted his vanishing-non-glory and is sinking into oblition, but has not accepted its finacial consecuences (such as having a shoe box of a department in London).. yet this is an astute social climber, he is well mannered and can adapt to the circunstances.. he uses as trampolin the wealthy country club where he teaches tennis... and indeed he mingles with the Hewetts, an aristocratic family who also share his love of opera.. but the psychopath cannot be contained and he pushes his luck to the limit...",1179100800,,930,4.987096774193549

2529992,3,B000EQHXNW,"How does a young man get rid of an obsessed lover that he himself was onced obsessed with?  That is the plot that Woody Allen crafts in Match Point.  In typical Allen fashion, the young man happens to be married and the object of his lust was the fiancee of his wife's brother.  We see once again Allen's interest in human relations.  Only this time comedy, satire, and neurotic compulsiveness are not at the forefront; murder is.  I felt that Allen didn't fully explore the depth of character needed to keep this viewer emotionally engaged. Scarlett Johansson is beautiful, but her role as the seductress turned stalker is uneven.  Allen did not get enough from her and I believe she still has much more to give. Jonathan Meyers in the lead is good, but he is no Ray Milland (Dial M for Murder) or Michael Douglass ( Fatal Attraction). The film lacks suspenseful editing and it never really reaches a climatic pitch.  The exterior shots of London and the use of tennis, highbrow English nobilty, and opera add to the film's plot, but not enough to save it from its first gear pace. I did like the twist that concluded the movie though. The supporting roles of the British police investigators were- how shall I say ""splendid"".",1174867200,6,1227,4.626728110599078

These characters simply don't have enough water under their bridges or connections of responsibility to make their moral decisions significant enough for us, the viewers. It ends up no more than a story you might read about in the newspaper, and then turn the page. The dialogue is mundane, uninteresting, unrevealing.  Woody Allen yearns so much to be Chekov that he strays from his own genius. This is a completely serious movie that remains flat throughout, despite a surprising turn.  And that turn tells us that there actually is no presence of love in this plot at all--which indicates that the demon in this story is only from the shallowest levels of hell--a devil of straw--just evil chaff in the wind. Instead, for a very strong, punch-in-the-gut movie about infidelity, I would suggest Mike Nichols' ""Closer""--a strong conflict with morally challenged characters whose dialogue is far from mundane, heavily energetic and engaging, and without the affected Chekov. Lots of coincidental similarities in the two movies too--same settings, similar characters, and even Jude Law looks and speaks a lot like Jonathan Myers (check out the similarities in the DVD cover illustrations). But in ""Closer,"" Law's character's inner conflicts are much more externalized, giving us a sense of the whys and wherefores of his actions. Myers character simply doesn't flesh out. In the end, we really don't care about him anymore. He's no Hamlet, nor even Macbeth.

Even if this were a new film, it's terribly flawed. The viewer isn't trusted at all to understand the issues of the story, and so themes and images are featured in a highly repetitious manner. (One scene I especially hated was a closeup of a tennis ball straddling the net and eventually tipping to illustrate the theme of chance, which had already come up numerous times...) Disappointing.

""Math Point"" was one of very few movies from 2005 that I really wanted to see and could not wait for it to open. High praise from both the critics and the audience alike only contributed to my impatience. What did I get? Allen recycled one of his own earlier masterpieces, used only a drama part of it and created a good-looking movie with myriads of references to the works of literature and cinema that had told the same story much better than he did this time. What is fascinating, the earlier masterpiece that I've mentioned above is twenty minutes shorter than ""Match Point"" but it had said so much more with such power that Allen himself was not able to recreate. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is not Martin Landau and Scarlet Johansson is not Angelica Huston. It is nothing wrong to borrow from himself but nothing original or compelling came from ""Match Point"". I enjoyed his silly ""Scoop"" and his dramedic ""Melinda & Melinda"" much better than his almost universally proclaimed as masterpiece ""Match Point"". I said once and I am repeating that Allen makes good, very good and excellent films. Let's say that I prefer his combination of drama and comedy to pure drama. There have been many great dramas but ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is beyond great, it is unique. ""Match point"" lacks Allen's unique personality. It is not a bad movie but it could've been done by any director.

One last note: more than once I've seen the same scene in the movies lately - the main character reads a Dostoyevsky's novel in an opening scene - gives you a very good idea what to expect by the end.",1173657600,2,1619,4.618055555555555
2529996,2,B000EQHXNW,"Any type of romantic film, be it comedy or tragedy, must capture, at least, the attention of the audience by making the characters interesting.  Usually we feel sympathy for the lovers and wish them well.  However, we may even despise one or both of them but the story may still be compelling.

The problem, for me, about Match Point, is that, although both Chris Wilton and Nola Rice are physically attractive, I really do not care what happens to them.  In such a case as Iago, a schemer can be fascinating but I found both Chris and Nola to be boring to the nth degree.

Why would anyone with the wonderful wife and general set up in life, throw it away for an affair with Nola?  I am not sure if the problem was in the acting or in the script but she was nothing but dull.  The brother of Chris' wife, Chloe, made the best decision of his life when he dumped her.

However, the ending does make the whole project more interesting but I will not mention what happens.  Perhaps the interesting ending saves the film but still I have some reservations.

If you want a film along the lines of ""Fatal Attraction,"" the heroine has to be more than just outwardly attractive.  I should say that I am a great fan of Woody Allen, and this is only the 2nd time that I have felt disappointed by his films.",1173225600,6,1297,4.318181818181818

This movie will definately make you wonder about Love, Lust and Life.",1172361600,,357,4.507692307692308
2529998,4,B000EQHXNW,"I don't think there has been a modern filmmaker who has examined romantic love and relationships as in depth as Woody Allen. Allen has been a prolific filmmaker who often writes, directs, produces, and acts in his own pictures. Out of the Allen canon, 90% of the films revolve around romantic love. However, despite the many awards and the adoration of critics and the love of many New Yorkers, Allen has never been a popular filmmaker. His films tend to fall on the high end of art and are usually ignored (many times undeservedly so) by the general public. That was until Allen left New York and the U.S. and decided to try to make a film entirely overseas in the mother country of England. When he did that, he made a small little picture entitled MATCH POINT that not only is a quirky modern murder mystery that examines the difference between lust and love, but also became his first film in nearly two-decades to make a huge profit.

MATCH POINT stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Chris Wilton, a former tennis pro seeking to start a new life. Even though Chris can play tennis really well, he never was much of a contender. However, he hasn't lost much talent and has a lot of skills and talks his way into being hired as an instructor at a posh London club. While working there he befriends the wealthy Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode). Tom invites Chris to the family estate where he meets Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris finds Chloe somewhat attractive, but sees in her more as a means of attaining social stature and wealth. While at the estate Chris is also introduced to Tom's American girlfriend, Nola (Scarlett Johansson). Chris is smitten with Nola and she is attracted to him as well, but it is with Chloe that Chris begins a relationship. She's the key to his future.

Chris treats Chloe well and her parents begin to accept him into their family. However, the Hewetts shun Nola. She's an American and an actress, two things that the wealthy old family just can't seem to abide with. Chloe's father soon offers Chris a job with the family company and Chris' social star is on the rise. Although he treats Chloe affectionately, it is with Nola that Chris seeks his true pleasure. The two begin a heated, passionate affair. They become consumed by their lust for each other. Yet, just as Chris is using Chloe, Nola is using Chris to further her own interests. However, Nola doesn't really suspect that Chris is playing her, too. It is a conflict between love and lust, between ambition and simple goal-setting, and between good and evil.

The film never glorifies Chris' bad behavior. Of course, it doesn't make excuses for the bad choices that the other characters make, either. Instead, the film displays what happens when people allow themselves to be controlled by their unbridled passions. It's a modern morality tale that we can all learn from. Having been written and directed by Woody Allen makes MATCH POINT even more interesting. This is a must see film for fans of Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson. It's also a great film to watch if you're in the mood for a serious, intriguing drama with a strong, moral message.",1172016000,,3144,4.681735985533454
2529999,1,B000EQHXNW,"I knew going into this not to expect a Woody Allen movie.  For one, he usually writes a part for himself, which nobody but him could play.  That's the type of Woody Allen movie I like and feels natural.  Match Point on the contrary just felt empty.  This isn't to say Woody has lost his touch.  I very much enjoyed Scoop, in which Scarlett Johansson stars with him in.

Like I said before, I knew this would not be a typical Woody movie, but I wonder if it had been directed by anyone else would I have liked it any better or worse.  The whole movie is basically about an affair.  I wish I could ellaborate on that, but that really is pretty much the whole plot, spelled out for you.

Jonathan Rhys Meyers does an OK job and Scarlett is pretty much what you expect.  They have an affair, but then what?  Scene after scene of her demanding to know when he's going to leave his wife for her like he keeps promising he will.  His real wife suspects he's having an affair because he's always on the phone with her and he denys it.  It felt like there wasn't enough written to fill a whole movie so Woody just repeated the same scenes over and over until it becomes tedious beyond belief.

I can't ruin the ending for you.  I wish I could to save you 2 uneventful hours of your time, but let's just say nothing changes.  No consequences, no point A to point B, just a monotonous string of events that leads no where and leaves you feeling worse than you did before you watched it.",1171670400,11,1475,4.214285714285714

In the scenes where Chris, the supposed tennis pro, is on court, his playing is mediocre at best - he's not good even by teaching pro standards, so he certainly isn't convincing as a former tour player who, according to his friend from the tennis tour, could have conceivably beaten any of the top players in the world.  Even the tennis-related dialogue seems lifted from a Thirties film set at a country club; the chats about ""top seeds"" aren't believable to anyone who has any familiarity with the pro tennis world.  For Heaven's sake, at the start of the film Chris even mispronounces the name of Greg Rusedski, who is a former Top 5 player from England!  I can't believe someone didn't catch that.  Oh, well - I suppose I should just be pleased that tennis was the focal point of a major film...and ""Match Point"" is certainly vastly superior to the hackneyed ""Wimbledon"".",1170892800,5,983,4.758823529411765
2530001,3,B000EQHXNW,"In this film Woody Allen has delivered a decent yet predictable movie that does have a surprise twist at the end. You will see some very nice shots of London in this film.

He plays a failed tennis pro who leads on a sweet girl and her loving family who you feel really cares for him. All the while he is pursuing what would become his brother-in-laws fianc&eacute;e. All I could think of this character from the moment he met Nola, played by Scarlett Johansson, was that he was a truly pathetic human being. So the movie does stir emotions in you as you watch it, the feeling of tension.

Chris marries sweet and loving Chloe, played by Emily Mortimer, in order to acquire a life of wealth and success. His father-in-law provides him with a job, training, an education and a guarantee that he will never want for anything as long as Chloe was happy.

2530024,4,B000EQHXNW,"Woody Allen's first film shot in London is very different from most of his previous work. The acting is uniformly excellent, the sets and panoramic views are magnificent and really show off the best of modern London, the pace works well, and the drama gradually sucks you in. The story is fairly serious, there is little humour (zany or otherwise).

Some people will really like this, others will find it hard work or depressing. About three quarters of the way through there is a shock twist, the story changes from drama to thriller and doesn't end the way most people will have anticipated. The good aspect of this is that the film isn't boringly predictable, the problem is that some viewers will have great difficulty in suspending disbelief that the final outcome could possibly happen.

The central character, Chris Wilton (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a former tennis professional from a poor Irish background. The film starts with him doing a voice-over about the fact that in tennis sometimes the ball catches in the top of the net. If it tips over, ""you win,"" if the ball falls back to your side, ""you lose."" Much later in the film, you see a round object hit the top of a barrier as it falls, and the camera zooms in in exactly the same way - it is clear that which side of the barrier the object falls will have life transforming consequences for the central character. And it does - but not in the way you expect.

Jonathan Rhys Meyers delivers an excellent performance as Chris Wilton, flawless except perhaps that he seems to have too perfectly removed the least sign in his looks, accent, mannerisms or dress that he supposedly comes from a poor Irish background. Arriving in London, he gets a job as a tennis coach, and one of his clients, Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) introduces Chris to his super-wealthy family. Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) falls very deeply in love with Chris: her father Alec (Brian Cox) is also impressed by him, and before he knows it Chris is being groomed both as Chloe's future husband and for a glittering business career in one of Alec's companies.

Chris is quickly seduced both by Chloe and by the life of wealth and comfort which her family offers. The one barrier on his path to a life of success and affluence is that he is badly smitten by Tom's fiancee Nola, played by Scarlett Johanssen. Perhaps the most implausible of the many unlikely elements of the film is that Scarlett Johanssen's character is a failing actress - for all the suggestion that she loses her confidence at interviews it is hard to credit that the smouldering femme fatale she plays throughout the film would be unable to land any acting roles.

The love triangle between Chris, Nola, and Chloe leads steadily and inexorably to disaster, but not the disaster which the viewer thinks you can see coming. At first Chris seems to be faced with a choice -  on one side his wealthy and comfortable life with a woman who loves him, on the other, poverty and the woman who he really lusts after. You are never quite sure which of them - if either - he truly loves. But the choice he actually makes is much darker.

Emily Mortimer is in great danger of getting typecast as the nice girl who falls badly for a man who lets her down, but perhaps this is because, as in ""Sleeping Dictionary"" and ""Young Adam,"" she plays this roles very well.

Besides Rhys Meyers, Johanssen, and Mortimer, the rest of the cast are excellent, including James Nesbitt as a police detective.

The shared taste which gets Chris his initial introduction to Tom's family is a love of Opera, and the soundtrack features many opera greats including arias from La Traviata, Rigoletto and Macbeth, both recent performances and old recordings by Caruso and others.

The biggest issue which many people, especially those who know London well, will have with the film is the credibility of the conclusion. I don't think anyone can have told Woody Allen that Britain has a fifth of the world's CCTV cameras and London has more of them than any other city on earth - to say more than that would give away the ending.

Overall this was a clever and stylish film. I'm glad I watched it, but would put this down as one to rent rather than buy.",1169337600,5,4233,4.615691489361702

2530026,5,B000EQHXNW,"Although similar to Allen's Crimes and Mesdemeanors, (1989) Match Point differs in many significant areas, including the ruthless social climbing of the protagonist, Chris Wilton, (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) as he moves into London's wealthy class.

Meyers gave a compelling and strong performance as Chris Wilton reminding me of the literary character, Tom Ripley, who similarly pushes his way up the social ladder using anything at his disposal to attain what he wants, including murder. Ripley has often been characterized as the likable sociopath and villain, however, there's really nothing to like about Wilton, finding myself throughout the viewing wanting him to stumble and be discovered as the fraud he truly is. Wilton is handsome and charming, subtlety seducing Chloe Hewitt (Emily Mortimer) the daughter of a wealthy business man, Alec Hewitt (Brian Cox) eventually wriggles into their world of class and privilege.

Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) is a mid-western girl trying to become an actress in London. Rice meets the Hewitt son Tom, (Matthew Goode) and becomes his fianc.

Johansson's performance is right on the mark, a sultry and beautiful femme fatale, whose sexual magnetism pulls the now married Chris Wilton into a lurid and obsessive affair. The scenes between Johansson and Meyers are performed extremely well as one can at times fill the heat come off the screen.

Unfortunately it has been stated in other reviews that Allen is out of his comfort zone in London making this picture and this is reflected in the production - I couldn't disagree more as Remi Adefarasin's cinematography is at times brilliant, capturing many beautiful areas of London. This film was indeed creatively and professionally shot.

Woody Allen's screenplay, well, particularly the dialogue, is absolutely shining with wit and depth. In fact it is the dialogue the carries the film along. After a slew of average films, (for Woody Allen) Match Point stands out as and can stand with, his other master pieces such as Hannah and her Sisters, Crimes and Mesdemeanors, Annie Hall and The Purple Rose of Cairo.

As a Woody Allen fan for many years, I've followed his career through its ups and downs, and Match Point clearly demonstrates that the old master continues to have what it takes to create a great film.",1168041600,5,2308,5.141333333333334

I haven't seen the film Crimes and Misdemoneanors but I still felt like I've here before.  Two thirds of the film reminds me of the Julia Roberts's film Closer with out the crude language.  It was impossible to connect with Chris's (Jonathan Rhys Meyers)charcter, an ambitious ex-tennis pro who seems to navigate fairly easily up the social ladder and who showed early signs of craziness becomes obsessed with a woman who he only wants as a playmate.  Typical.  Nola's character doesn't seem as consistent.  She is this aggressive woman who shows a zest for life-then when she hooks up with Chris, she's sudden a very needy woman who needs everything spelled out to her.  Any femme fatale worth their salt would have weighed this situation differently.  Chris was a man who would have had nothing if he'd left his wife.  As harsh as this sounds-she would have been better off remaining the mistress of a wealthy man than the wife of a broke one.  I'm just saying.

2530028,3,B000EQHXNW,"I always thought that Crimes and Misdemeanors, despite its commercial success, was Woody Allen's most cynical movie. He followed that film with some silly fun films (Bullets Over Broadway, Manhattan Murder Mystery, MIghty Aphrodite) and some strange ones (Husbands and Wives, Shadows and Fog), among others, mostly I suppose to dilute the bad taste it left in his mouth.  I mean, what was he REALLY saying?  That murder is OK as long as you can get away with it?  Come on, we know that couldn't sit well with the Wood Man.  So he went and made a bunch of movies to cleanse his exposed immoral soul!!!  Or something psychoish like that.

With Matchpoint, it seems that Allen has decided to take a deep breath and delve back into the dark side.  In Crimes and Misdemeanors, Martin Landau plays a now-privileged opthamologist who has embarked on an affair that can destroy his successful life.  After playing some moral games in his head, he digs deep and decides to put a hit on his lover, played sadly by the incomparable Angelica Huston.  Somehow, he gets away with it. (Or does he? as Woody Allen's character asks in the last scene of the 1989 film).  Well, now it's 2005 or 2006, whatever, it's now.  And so we now have a mentally not tough tennis pro played by Jonathan Myers who takes on the Landau role.  Instead of Angelica Huston, now Allen gives us the biggest gun of all, the incomparably gorgeous Scarlett Johansson.  Oh God.... What to do?  Do you keep the privileged life you have always dreamed of?  Or do you throw it all away and relegate yourself to a penniless existence, all so you can make endless love with Scarlett Johansson?  Hmmm.  What a moral dilemma. Talk about your Greek tragedy!

Allen also is out of place in England, which is a very different society than the US, and his portrayal of its elite has no depth beyond well-trod formulas of priviledge based on hard work.

This is a story about a humble tennis pro and aspired American actress played by Scarlet Johansen.  They both try to climb up social ladder by connecting wealthy people and possibly marry into their family.  This movie offers you great writing and smart plot.  Woody Allen uses tennis as metaphor.  In the moment of the tennis match, ball hit the top of the net and it may end up either side of the court to decide the winner.  This metaphor was adapted wisely at the end of the movie.  The movie wisely portraits human natures, desires, behaviors, passions, and it was developed into love/drama/black comedy/thriller masterpiece.  I am thankful that Mike refused to give up details of the movie because less you know is better.  If you wanna be amused, do not even read a back of the DVD box.",1165449600,3,1073,4.541666666666667

This is one of those movies that make you think after watching it. The movie is about how luck changed Chris' (main character) life.

When you're playing tennis, sometimes the ball hits the net, and for a split moment, the ball can either go forward and you win, or it can go back and you lose. - from the movie.

After watching it, you can't stop, but rewind Chris' life in your head and analyze how his life changed because of this often overlooked thing, called luck. ""What if he hadn't met that person? What if he didn't do what he did?""

But it didn't stop there. The next day, I found myself analyzing my own life and how luck (or lack of) affected my life. You want to think that luck had nothing to do with who you are, but think about it. Just the fact that you were lucky enough to be born in a democracy in a great country should be reason enough to give ""luck"" more merit than it has.

Its a familiar situation, but it takes place among the veddy, veddy British with Scarlett Johannssen as the mistress.

The major plot hole: if the murdered Scarlett left a diary behind why didn't she mention she was pregnant in it? Or did I miss something?",1164153600,5,459,4.542168674698795
2530054,2,B000EQHXNW,"Nominally a story of a young man who by sheer luck is drawn into a life of wealth and love between two women.  One becomes his wife from whose family affords him a wealthy lifestyle and a lucrative career.  He's love for her is real and it is a comforting Eros that has all the marks being built for a lifetime.  His mistress, however, is only of modest means but, in contrast to his wife, is mercurial, exciting, and erotic.  Naturally, it is the mistress that becomes pregnant.  As his mistress puts pressure on him to leave his wealth and wife for her, he struggles with how to live with the best of both worlds.  Under the threat that the mistress will inform the wife, the young man hatches a murder plot which succeeds only by a single happenstance of fortune.

This could have been an excellent and well told story; but its unusual plot is completely ruined by a plodding, graduate school concern to show literary sophistication.  In other words, it is quite dull.  A complete waste of the talents of the actors.

This film has all the things we have come to love and hate coming from Woody Allen.  The main character is a pipe for Allen's own belief in universe without justice and purpose.  It is not exactly a warming point of view; but it does provide the mainspring for the story's novel resolution.  At the same time, the film is at pains to show the cosmopolitanism, refined taste, and the odd belief that ordinary human concerns and pursuits are raised to Olympian, rarified heights by eccentricity Allen projects on his characters.  This is all too precious.  To add to the lack of verisimilitude, the mistress is an unemployed actress of a modest background who is forced to take a low paying job in London; yet she seems to have lots of spare time, spends loads of money, and lives in an apartment we should all be so lucky to get much the same as her wealthy counterparts.

In the end, our murderer is confronted by the ghosts of his victims.  It is here that the story's ""message"" comes through.  It is tempting to construe the murderer's calm rebuff to these specters as a mere rationalization.  Instead, it is Allen's resolution of the old theological problem the presence of evil in a universe under the control of a good, all-powerful God.

To wit:  There is no God.  No purpose.  No justice.  Evil exists--but it simply ""is"" as all other things in life ""are"".

 I doubt if Allen thinks he came across this viewpoint all by himself.  A man as well read as Allen surely knows this variety of nihilism can be found in the ancient Greeks.  Be that as it may, it is hardly a thought underrepresented in modern culture.  This is where I fault Allen the most.  Most of nihilism's acolytes have the good sense to make their hobbyhorse entertaining and fun.  There are musicians who believe their tune making is more artistic and ""musical"" if they avoid all the attractive ""hooks"".  Perhaps Allen believes his molasses-like, mirthless narrative is a mark of thoughtful seriousness.

What is this film about? I can't be bothered to tell you because you'll get bored. You have to see it to appreciate it.

Boxed into a corner and facing imminent disclosure, he comes to a desperate conclusion: Someone must die to cover his sins.

2530058,4,B000EQHXNW,"Woody Allen's ""Match Point"" is impossible to relate to - unless you were born with a $20 million trust fund.  Allen's movie explores the England of tennis clubs, massive country estates, posh London townhouses, opera, and the appearance of ""work.""  Maybe some readers out there know what it's like to have Daddy basically buy you a gorgeous husband, but I doubt that it's many.

In other respects, ""Match Point"" explores what is a near-universal human experience - pondering what I will do to protect the life I have built.  That Allen may explore this idea in a rather unconventional way just makes it all the more entertaining.

Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Chris, a poor Irish lad who has abandoned the competitive life of the pro tennis circuit to teach tennis at one of London's most elite clubs.  Allegedly self-reliance and ""wanting to make a contribution,"" Chris is also the kind of guy who reads ""Crime and Punishment"" with the Cambridge Companion by his side to help him through the tough parts.  Chris really doesn't want to do his own heavy lifting.

This is proven when he gets invited to the opera by one of his students, Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode).  Tom is the scion of one of England's wealthiest families, heading by business tycoon Alec (Brian Cox).  Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), is attractive, intelligent, and spoiled rotten.  As an aside, it is amazing what a little make-up and costume work can do, 'cause Chloe is a bit frumpy, while the dazzling Ms. Mortimer can also be radiant - see her brief role as ""Perfect Girl"" in ""Notting Hill.""  But I digress.

Chloe wants Chris.  Badly.  So Daddy buys Chris.  Sure, Chris protests about paying his own way and all that, but soon Chris is living in an amazing flat Alec purchased for him and Chloe, spending nights at the opera in the family box, being driven by the company car to a job given to him by Alec, and shopping at those London stores where you need a personal financial statement just to get int the door.  Chris is the epitome of the kept man - Chloe even says what is necessary for him to keep his dignity as they both know it is being washed away.

Allen injects a wicked dagger into this tranquil scene in the form of Nola (the superbly-sultry Scarlett Johansson).  Nola is engaged to Tom, but Chris can't keep his eyes or hands off of her.  But Tom's family does not really approve of the American Nola, who is only a struggling actress.

The plot seemingly boils down to whether Chris will act on his lust for Nola, thereby putting his perfect life of ease at risk.  Because it's Scarlett, every man in the audience is tempted along with Chris.  But fortunately for the audience, Allen has some dastardly twists and turns in store, and what seems to be a conventional set-up develops swiftly into a dark and sordid tale.

""Match Point"" opens with Chris reading the line, ""I'd rather be lucky than good.""  When a main character says that, you know the story will either turn on his good luck or his bad luck.  It is to Allen's credit that the audience will go back and forth - like a tennis match - on whether Chris's luck will hold or break.  Ultimately, only at match point will the answer be revealed.

While hardly an amazing movie, ""Match Point"" is a lot of dark fun.  Watch it for some black humor and some unsettling moments, and to go green with envy that you were not born wealthy and English.",1163116800,3,3393,4.56198347107438
2530059,2,B000EQHXNW,"Match Point may offer a change of locale and style for Woody Allen but it does nothing to redress the continuing decline of his work. It's not bad, more flat, partially because of some awkward dialogue (Allen really doesn't have an ear for the British dialects, going either for Dick Van Dyke or Medieval King-speak) and some uninspiring lead performances. Social climbing tennis pro Jonathan Rhys Myers, the poor man's Jude Law, says all his lines correctly and with almost perfect diction without ever convincing there's anything but an actor who'll never fulfil his early promise underneath, but it's Scarlet Johannson who is the film's most surprising casualty as a struggling actress. Faced with such awkwardly on the nose dialogue and such a stock character, she visibly flounders for much of the first half of the film as if cast adrift by a director afraid of interfering with the actors by ever directing them no matter how apparent it is that they need help. Supporting players are mostly left to do their best with one-note parts to varying degrees of success (Matthew Goode, Ewan Bremner Alexander Armstrong), laziness (Brian Cox, Paul Kaye) and embarrassment (James Nesbitt and a startlingly inept Colin Salmon). The second half does improve, though there's the definite feeling that Allen is dodging the issue in the potentially promising but unintentionally laughable closing scenes, and some of the dialogue is painfully amateur. With its shades of A Kiss Before Dying via the Martin Landau plot strand of Crimes and Misdemeanors but without the interesting bits, this never really feels quite like a proper movie. A bit of a plodder.",1162684800,,1650,5.069852941176471
2530060,5,B000EQHXNW,"Having seen Woody Allen's Annie Hall at such a cynical, nearly adult-like age (about two to three weeks ago), I quickly fell in love with the thin Jew who lives behind Coke bottle glasses. Although his works in recent memory haven't been quite memorable (e.g. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, Hollywood Ending, the disastrous Celebrity and the disregarded Melinda and Melinda), there was something about Match Point that struck somewhere in the realm of classy.

Scarlett Johansson, who might be remembered as the dull figure from the dry and morose Lost in Translation (yes, I indeed hated the film), lights up the screen alongside Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. The two find themselves in a heated love story that takes elements of 2004's Closer, the gritty dark persona of human life in Unfaithful, and the ridiculous and moronic elite of any Oscar Wilde play. The story starts with the introduction of pretty boy Chris Wilton - a successful tennis pro that comes to teach London's wealthy residents. Through his new career, Chris (Rhys-Meyers) finds a future in one of his client's sisters, Chloe (Emily Mortimer). In a seemingly happy and surreal attempt at a marriage, the white road is offset by an affair Chris decides to attempt with Nola (Johansson) - who is to be wed to Chloe's brother. I think America's seen enough soap operas to know what happens next - or at least to have some expectations.

Allen takes the simple, standard love affair of Match Point and strikes it repeatedly with twists both on an emotional platform and on the usual thrill ride that is offered at most of film's carnivals. For the first time in ages, Allen dives deep into the characters and reveals an almost neo-realist outlook on the persona of every character he creates. The emotions are raw, and, while the story is standard flair and foam, Allen throws in elements of Dostoevsky and nearly depicts an adaptation of Crime and Punishment.

Everything works here, and the film bites both the heart and the lips. It's tense, bewildering, and all at once exciting to the point where the viewer is as unsure of what will happen next as the characters are with their own choices. Great developments in the themes of guilt and conscience are presented, and while the love story may have some smiling, the conclusion, and rather dark underbelly of the film, will have others dwindling.

Match Point is without a doubt one of the finest films of its genre and one of the first. There is something here both recognizable and new; I'm still uncertain. Rest assured, this is a great film.",1161820800,7,2560,4.824601366742597
2530061,3,B000EQHXNW,"Am I the only person who found the whole story like something out of a soap opera? The social climbing, the adultery, the pregnancy, the murder...it's a little too much like something that you would see on daytime tv. I didn't find the plot twist that shocking, I'm sorry. I think the desperation was pretty apparent so if you were paying attention, it shouldn't have greatly surprised you. I think the problem was that it was done so matter-of-factly. Like in sports films when the star player dramatically falls down and breaks their neck and the audience is supposed to gasp in horror. It's been done to death. Maybe I'm just a cynical moviegoer, but instead of being shocked, I rolled my eyes.

Now there are plaenty of good things about this film too. The acting for one is notable especially Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. Whoever casted him did a good job because he just has one of those faces where you're never quite sure what's going on underneath. I also think the writing and directing was done very well. The characters are well developed throughout the story, and my attention was pretty well kept. However, I found myself looking at the time wondering when it was going to be over. I guess I kept waiting for something else to happen. Basically, the story unerwhelmed me and I found it tedious.

As far as the movie goes, I guess it's one of Woody's better films of late, but is that a compliment?  It reminded me of 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' but in that movie we had a likable Woody Allen character to root for.  In this movie everybody is pretty much unlikable.

Though the movie is full of lust, love, the fear of not getting to live a lavish lifestyle because your cheating on your wife, oh and the woman you cheated with is also your brother-in-law's girlfriend.

 See what makes Match Point so mysterious and vile is that I could tell most of the film and the viewer still wouldn't be prepared for the huge plot twist. I have seen some crazy twist in a movie but the one in this film was badly needed. You start to get lost somewhere around the middle when the director works that movie magic that makes time go faster. You have no idea what the heck is going on because you had no fair warning like a big ""2 years later "" sign and you think it's still the same year. Besides that and seeing Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johansson rolling around every 10 minutes I'd say everything else was done well.

2530065,5,B000EQHXNW,"Woody Allen (even when writing for the English) must have at least one split infinitive, this one comes during if I remember the last 10 minutes.  Also his language for the British has a strong american flavor.  The movie was a half hour too long.  Like someone else said, it dragged, though not in the middle, but at the begining.  Chris' divided emotions could have been shown in about 10 minutes, and I wish they had been.  The rest of the movie, though, was a knock out.  Another review said there was very little music in it.  The damn thing was loaded with music.  Opera was the background music, just as Tin Pan Alley made up the soundtrack for ""Bullets Over Broadway.""  Because in this flick, all the main characters were opera buffs.  Me, too.  And I thought it was clever.  Along with other things, Allen has a  genius for picking his soundtracks.  Yes.  It's similar in some ways to ""Crimes and Misdemeanors.""  Particularly in its cynicism, though Crimes was more cynical.  I didn't see the hero in this movie as a bad man.  More like a trapped one.  In a nod to Bergman (?), the hero at the start of the flick is reading ""Crime and Punishment,"" then as another person pointed out, looking up what he's read in a ""what does it really mean"" type reference.  Except that that particular Dostoyevsky isn't all that hard to understand, and as the plot discloses, our hero is not that stupid.  Not at all.  I thought I was going to quit and throw it away during the 1st 30 or 45 minutes, then it got going.  I wish it had been Allen's (and Bergman's) usual 82 minutes long.  I think if it had been, I would consider it (with ""Annie Hall"") Allen's best movie.  With the qualifications already mentioned.  Finally, as for it's being a ""thriller,"" you have to wait for that, and I almost called the blurb a fraud and chucked it.  Glad I didn't.

2530066,4,B000EQHXNW,"Woody Allen finally left New York City, perhaps for good, and comes back with this `serious' work. `Match Point' stars Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Chris Wilton, a former pro tennis player and social climber, whose life reminds you of the novels of Patricia Highsmith. In fact, you can call him Talented Mr. Ripley, but Allen re-uses and gives sly twists to the familiar rules of thrillers and melodramas so cleverly that Chris's story becomes a study of our life in general seen from a delightfully cynical point of view.

I don't have much to say about the plot itself. The fast-paced story about ambitious Chris is set in London, where he meets two girls: Chloe (Emily Mortimer), good-natured girl and daughter of a rich president of some big company, and Nora (Scarlett Johansson), American girl who wants to be an actress. So which choice will Chris take?

[CLEVER MELODRAMA] The answer is, of course, ""Both."" `Match Point' is about infidelity or ambition, but at the same time it is about chance, or luck, and the role it plays in our life. Allen intentionally employs various kind of clich seen in noirs or thrillers to emphasize this point, which is ultimately summarized with the neat conclusion at the last five minutes of the film. It is not as surprising as some people say - we have seen a much cleverer one in `Plein soleil' (1960) based on, yes, Patricia Highsimth - but it is still well-calculated.

Frankly I don't agree with Allen's view on life, but its cynicism is certainly fascinating. Allen's London is, quite understandably, that of outsiders, seen from the viewpoint of a tourist, and the film's postcard beauty, people living there might say, does not really represent the city. Still we should know that this is not about the real London or its high society; it is about the imaginary place hovering between reality and fiction.

The film also has some shrewd references to opera, painting, and literature. An American in England is a familiar theme in novels, and one Dostoevsky novel plays a significant role in the plot twist. But you don't have to know these things at all; it is a thriller in Woody Allen style. There are no quirkily funny dialogues, but still `Match Point' is a compelling drama with one or two interesting commentaries about life.",1160006400,2,2276,4.798469387755102
2530067,5,B000EQHXNW,"There exists an erroneous notion among the majority of the aesthetic audience that great artists will inevitably produce great works. However, upon close examination of the careers of those few considered to be masters, one must note that in only the rarest cases do artists experience unencumbered access to the greatest reaches of their talents. ""The House of Mirth"" and ""The Age of Innocence"" stand out almost like flukes in the career of Edith Wharton; Eugene O'Neill produced two or three ""Emporer Jones""es for every ""The Iceman Cometh,"" and ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" remains singular among his works; twenty years passed between Kurosawa's ""Throne of Blood"" and his ""Kagemusha."" Is there any doubt, then, that Woody Allen can be considered a great artist?
  If there exists such doubt, ""Match Point"" should dispel it. This rich and complex moral tale is woven in the fine, subtle threads of a great novel. It explicates its themes in frank but poetic observations: the fall of a tennis ball caught in the net becomes the very notion of chance; a jarring painting displays a woman's inner life. Allen is in full form here, writing characters whose tastes and actions say much more about them than they'd ever say about themselves, and guiding actors to inject into each character an inner life, displayed in fleeting glances and tilts of the head. Like a great novel, ""Match Point"" contains not a word misplaced; it manages to fully evoke characters and themes without ever seeming forced or heavy handed.
  Allen framed his recent film ""Melinda and Melinda"" around an argument over the relative qualities of tragedy and comedy in art, telling his story twice with minor changes meant to illustrate those forms. ""Match Point"" is a similarly illustrative tale: this one is meant to demostrate that life is governed by chance. It is an informal affair, not at all prescriptive- Allen does not attempt to prove anything, save within the confines of his tale. Thus ""Match Point"" is a culmination of his work not only in ""Melinda and Melinda,"" but also ""Crimes and Misdemeanors""- the work in Allen's ouvre whose theme ""Match Point"" most clearly echoes. It is, however, a more mature work than either, as it neither explicates its own intentions nor offers its themes as an argument; it doesn't tell, it shows, and never has the old addage about how to make a movie been more right.
  Having thus argued for the film a a compliment to Allen's canon, all that remains is to look at it singularly. ""Match Point"" is a Dreiserian melodrama composed with the musical clarity of top-form Scott Fitzgerald. It tells of a thoroughly Fitzgeraldian protagonist- a directionless man prone to extravegance and dissipation- meeting and being assimilated into an effete capitalist aristocracy. Chris is the sort of young man who begrudges not being able to pick up a tab, and yet never picks one up. Born poor in Ireland, he has gone to the limit of his only known talent- tennis- and been found wanting. While dating the sister of the man who pays his bills he meets that man's fiancee, the similarly coddled American actress Nola, and seeing in her a bit of his mercenary self (coupled with the body of Scarlett Johansson), he is instantly smitten. The two embark on a sensuous affair that threatens Chris's increasingly comfortable lifestyle; much devilish duplicity ensues. Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Chris, has an incredible sensuousness in his face and demeanor, and uses it to convey his character's crass materialism vividly. He imbues Chris, an increasingly despicable person, with enough emotion to make him the object of empathy- no small feat. Johansson makes Nola, a character simultaneously aware of, and willing to use, her impact on men and yet still quite reserved about doing so, believable- she invests her character with a much-needed sincerity. Emily Mortimer, as Chris's girlfriend and later wife Chloe, is both vivacious and kind, both sweet and needy. She is the film's most easily empathizable character, but one no less difficult to grasp than Chris or Nola, and Mortimer does a fantastic job. And, as is usual with an Allen film, the cinematography is superb and the staging very natural. Opera is used as knowingly and as comfortably as ever jazz was in an Allen film. Altogether, Allen and his cast and crew create a world that is both lived-in and breathable. The scenes of seduction are infused with an eroticism heretofore largely absent in Allen's work, and the dialogue rolls off the actors' tongues like off-screen conversation- there is none of Allen's schtick here, nor is there any of his sometimes stagey formalism. ""Match Point"" is both intellectually engaging and tremendously entertaining, like the work of Fitzgerald or Dostoevsky. It is realism in its purest, most rewarding form.
  Woody Allen has submitted his masterpiece in ""Match Point."" It recalls themes long embedded in his work, but synthesizes them into an altogether realistic and altogether original film. There is no precedent for ""Match Point"" in Allen's canon. While ""Annie Hall,"" ""Hannah and Her Sisters,"" ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" and, arguably, ""Manhattan"" and ""Bullets Over Broadway"" are classics, Allen has stepped outside his traditional technique here to both validate them as classics and repudiate them as immature, by showing precisely what else he is capable of creating. Let us now lay any remaining doubt of Allen's genius to rest. ""Match Point"" is proof that Woody Allen is an artist of the highest order.",1159401600,7,5516,5.020765027322405

2530070,5,B000EQHXNW,"Woody Allen's 'Match Point' makes all the right moves.  From the beginning, British pro-tennis champion, Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rys Meyers), reflects that it is better to be lucky than it is to be good.  As he narrates we see a tennis match going on where only the ball is presented.  The volley goes until the ball hits the net, then the shot is frozen.  Which side will the ball land?  We're not sure.  We have to keep watching.  Not since the orchestra was used at the beginning of Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' has a focal point been more effectively presented to start a drama.  'Match Point' is always absorbing and presents its story in a unique way that all but guarantees it will please the audience.

Chloe Hewett (Emily Mortimer), the daughter of a wealthy aristocrat, falls in love with Chris, and it is during their dating that he becomes infatuated with his fiance's brother's girlfriend, Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), an American actress who has relocated from the States.  His interest becomes an obsession, including all his efforts to make them into a foursome.  Convenient for him, Nola visits the family and becomes available in a blow-out scene from which she flees.  Awkwardly, the two consummate their longings, and from there complications naturally develop because of his two love interests.  He loves his fiance, Chloe, but has a passionate desire for Nola.  Chloe's family provides the trappings of wealth Chris also desires, and it seems all but likely that Tom, his future brother-in-law, will be betrothed to Nola.  Naturally, life doesn't work as planned.  Chris and Chloe get married.  Tom breaks off his relationship with Nola and marries someone else.  In the meantime, Chris does everything to push his employment responsibilities aside and cheat with Nola.  Chloe is obsessed with having children and their ability to conceive creates great tension.  Nola, on the other hand, quickly conceives herself after passion has left them off-guard and without proper prevention.  His decisions to try and have it all with money, lust, and love are the focal point of the rest of the movie.  To elaborate would spoil the fun, and, indeed, there is much to love about the development of this fine movie.

'Match Point' has all the greatness of genuine acting and masterful direction.  The details are effective and the relationships unfold in an intriguing fashion.  There is a subjective comparison to make:  Some of the movie reminds one of 'Closer,' but 'Match Point' is so unique that any comparisons to another movie are unfair.  'Match Point' is a superb creation that scores points for expert form and execution.",1159056000,,2664,4.968325791855204
2530071,3,B000EQHXNW,"I must admit I was disappointed.  I have really liked Woody Allen films - with or without him.  But this is a heavy handed revisiting of 'Crimes and Misdemeaners', still one of his very best.  The performers are fine but the characters are shallow and totally unaware of themselves and EVERYTHING going on around them.  A bit of Horatio Alger by Dickens and CSI.  The moral dilemma (if any of these characters are aware of the concept) is so blatantly all or nothing and the characters so at the mercy of luck (the point, eh?) that I felt nothing for them.  Not sorrow at their passing or joy at their success or sympathy at their wins or losses.  I simply didn't care or feel any guilt at not caring.  I didn't even analyze it to death.  Just on to the next DVD on rotation.  If the story appeals to you by all means see Crimes & Mis.  A much better, more subtle, more troubling, more rewarding film.",1158019200,2,901,4.335329341317365

A friend talked me into watching it.  I was surprised.  It was good.  I think in great part, because Allen was not IN it.  The movie had an interesting story line, with some twists and turns I didn't expect.

Definitely worth watching.",1157846400,2,377,4.0
2530093,2,B000EQHXNW,"Combine wheezy Hitchcock references, a ham-fisted lecture on Dostoevsky-ish nihilism, exhausted romantic misadventure formulaic pap and BAM; game, set, and Match Point.

Only an American would concoct such a fawning and loopy view of English upper crustaceans; these are not people so much as caricatures snipped from Punch cartoons.  (The most egregious example is Tom, played by Matthew Goode, who speaks like a contestant in the Monty Python Upper Class Twit of the Year Contest.)

Glossy and superficial, the movie resembles a collection of Architectural Digest photographs populated by Calvin Klein models.  London has never looked lovelier, but after careful scrutiny, MP delivers less than meets the eye.

This is not a typical Allen film, there's no small circle of hopelessly neurotic, narcissistic intellectuals swapping snappy patter and falling in and out of bed.  Nor is it funny.  The first two thirds consist of a brutally slow boy meets girl, boy marries nice girl, boy has affair with not nice girl, boy in terrible jam story.  The acting is good, Chris, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, projects the requisite moral emptiness and cowardice.

Scarlett Johansson, Nola, brings Body by Fisher appeal to the tale, but is so maddeningly wrong that viewers will want to slap Chris in the face with a large fish.  When Chris marries Chloe, we know long before any of the characters do that she is selling herself cheap.  Chloe is played by the enchanting Emily Mortimer, (unforgettable in Dear Frankie).  She is so unequivocally kind and good that watching Chris abuse her is especially painful and, in an odd and gloomy way, somehow inevitable.

Act three finds the picture completely changing gears as it attempts to hook viewers with a murder mystery.  While there is a murder, the only mystery in this picture is why Allen felt compelled to make it.  Critics will compare it to Crimes And Misdemeanors, but it's not nearly that good.  Get Broadway Danny Rose instead.",1157760000,5,1971,5.074534161490683
2530094,5,B000EQHXNW,"Over the course of a long career Allen has covered a lot of ground in his films, even if many think only of the New York settings and the autobiographical tilt of some of his work.
This crisp, extremely well-written film moves quickly through its main character's rise and fall in a distinctly American story of success and the soul. Echoes as disparate as Hitchcock and Theodore Drieser enrich the almost noirish guilt and claustrophobia which enlarge this character study into a nail-biting thriller. Comparisons to Crimes and Misdemeanors are inevitable, but this movie feels like an enlargement rather than a regurgitation of the former's themes.
This is a sharp, challenging entertainment for the discerning viewer, whether a fan of Allen's earlier work or not.",1157414400,5,766,5.136
2530095,5,B000EQHXNW,"A stylish, amoral  head trip of a movie that early-on explores the infamous question of whether it is better to be good or lucky. (I think this film gives its writer's opinion, and does so in a very interesting fashion.) Match Point is the sort of film that only reveals its true nature long after we'd mistakenly believed we'd summed it all up. What begins amid manners and mores as an exploration of relationships and social climbing (and luck) enters its final act as something else entirely: a psychological drama of intensely suspenseful proportions. This frigidly detached British-flavored drama was aptly billed with a tag line taken from a critic's interpretation as he asked, ""Think you know how it will end? Guess again."" And that critic was precisely right. I was stunned by the several unforeseen twists in the plot, all leading to a nerve-gripping ending, and was pleasantly surprised by this entire movie. It's among the best films I've seen in at least a year or two---skillfully-acted, carefully-crafted, with a rewarding focus on setting---and it's well worth owning on DVD.",1157328000,3,1091,5.027624309392265
2530096,3,B000EQHXNW,"This is a remake of Allen's earlier film ""Crimes and Misdemeanors""--only this time it takes place in London. Chris Wilton is an upwardly striving ex-tennis pro who, by a stoke of luck, marries into an enormously wealthy, upper-class family. The family talks in the same stilted way that the rich, WASP family in Allen's film ""Interiors"" did--Allen's writing about a world where he's an outsider and it shows. But Wilcox is an outsider too, and is undone by his affair with his brother-in-law's ex-fiancee, a failed American actress named Nola Rice, who's an emotional mess and trouble with a capitol T. She threatens to go to his wife and like Judah Rosenthal in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" Wilton plots her murder. Johnathan Rhys Meyers simply doesn't yet have the depth as an actor that the middle-aged Martin Landau did in C&M, so the emotional impact of the film ends up feeling muted. Also, in C&M, Allen's characters were in a New York milieu that Allen knew inside and out, and it gave the film (and Landau's character) a fluency and emotional depth that's missing here. The only authentic characterization in the film is Scarlett Johansson's as the neurotic Nola Rice. She's terrific and the film feels stiff and lifeless when she's not on the screen (maybe that's why Allen has to bring her back as a ghost). Rice is a female character-type Allen loves and knows all too well, and she brings out the best in him as a writer and director.

Allen sanitizes London in this film the same way he sanitizes New York. Woody Allen's cities are aesthetically and culturally beautiful environments for the rich. There's no place for the poor (or even the middle-class) except in their roles as maids, secretaries, nannies and chauffers for their wealthy employers. Or, like Nola Rice,  they can be illicit lovers and get in the way. Why is Allen so enthralled with wealth? Maybe he feels (or knows from experience) that poverty carries no intrinsic virtue. LIke Chris Wilton realizes in this film when he's faced with the loss of his affluent lifestyle, it just means you don't have any money.",1157155200,4,2091,4.821727019498607
2530097,2,B000EQHXNW,"The only thing I found worth watching in this film was Jonathan Rhys Meyers.  He kept me happily distracted from the awful storyline.  Woody has hit rock bottom. How original: boy wants to rise to the top and marries boss's daughter and then falls in love with a would-be actress.

Allen has made a film about English Upper Class that he obviously knows nothing about.  Woody Allen has done some less than great movies in recent years, but now he just seems to be going through the motions. Where's the clever dialog, the deep character studies and the intriguing plots and subplots that are hallmarks of his better work? The script and the direction seemed like the work of a college film major with a big budget.

It was lamentably long and so predictable to be excruciating.

There is no chemistry between any of the characters. It is dull and there doesn't seem to be any meaning at all, or reason. It's hard to care about any of the characters. The dialog is so written, as in, it seems as if the actors are reading written lines. The entire film seems as if it's a rehearsal rather than a film. The story centers on a young man who is a tennis instructor for the rich and then he marries into a very nice (much too nice) rich family. He then, for no apparent reason other than lust, has an affair with an American actress, girlfriend of his brother-in-law.  This film is compared to 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' because of the basic theme, and that is a travesty. 'Crimes and Misdemeaners' is one of the best films of all time.  This movie is horrific. Avoid it at any cost",1156550400,7,1576,4.466898954703833
2530098,1,B000EQHXNW,"Crimes and Misdemeanors is one of my favorite movies of all time. This film, although similar in plot and theme, is one of the worst. What we have here is a silly hodge podge of Crime and Punishment, Fatal Attraction, Titanic and Beverly Hills 90210.

The only engaging, credible character is the brother-in-law how is a minor character serving only to establish a plot point. What is supposed to be alluring about the Johanssen character? A wealthy, charming British man of the caliber of Tom is going to fall in love at first sight with somebody who comes across as any random second year theater major in the United States? The whole movie hinges on the Johanssen character being an irresistable sex siren that any man would make any sacrifice to have. She's not worldly, she's not very articulate, she's attractive but not stunning. She's American and comes from an undistinguished family. That's just to add the irrelevant 'Titanic' subplot for the mother-in-law.

The male lead is supposed to be Raskolnikov from Crime and Punishment. He wants to be the superman and ""do something important""? And that's supposed to manifest itself in reading Crime and Punishment on screen, going to the opera, taking an unspecified job in your father-in-law's generic, successful 'heavy hitter' corporation and then chasing around a blond Shannon Doherty behind your generic wife who can't get pregnant's back? I half expected them to be in a booth at the Peach Pit listing to opera on the jukebox. Well, Woody did shoehorn a murder of an old lady in there but that doesn't add to this guy's credibility of a superman in the making.

And thriller's need sharp, intelligent law enforcement officers. Not keystone cops who abandon a slum dunk case, on a dime, because of a red herring coincidence. Maybe in the 19th Century law enforcement would have looked the other way to protect the reputation of a prominent business family. In the 21st century, this would have been leaked to the tabloids faster than you can say Jack Sprat.

2530099,5,B000EQHXNW,"I am going to try and keep the following as spoiler free as possible, but do yourself a favor and watch the movie.

Just watch it. Stars Scarlet Johansson and that Irish dude (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) from [I]Bend it like Beckham[/I], directed by Woody Allen.

For the first three quarters it is a very interesting tale about the journey of an ex

Tennis pro, turned coach looking for more meaning from life. At relatively the same point in his life he meets two women. One is a young woman (Emily Mortimer) from an extremely wealthy and influential family, who is homely and highly available. The other is an extremely sexy out of work actress, Nola Rice (Scarlet Johansson).

The movie eventually sees him become that typical married man caught in a torrid affair. It is a marriage that brings him a lot of comfort, but there are certain needs that only Nola Rice can satisfy.

There is only so much story you can tell on the subject of adultery, and the movie covers it all in an extremely interesting manner. Yet whenever there is a story of an affair, you know you will hit crossroads.

As I watched a part of me wondered how it was possible for the movie to end in a satisfying manner. That was when a very small voice suggested something dark and devious.

It was just a fantasy, I swear. But it looks like Woody Allen had the same one.

I actually didn't know this was a Woody Allen film, and it certainly wasn't a typical one. I thought it was extremely good, and would recommend it to anyone.",1155600000,2,1499,4.445255474452555

True, like most Allen film in my opinion, most of the development at the beginning is a little on the dry side and can be tedious, but what a pay off. I think one thing that movies with almost hypnotically boring character development is that they unknowingly, or not, draw the audience in and passively forcing them to relate on a different level than normal with the players. I know that I can relate to most of the characters feelings, maybe not actions however. So, without giving away the parts of the movie that makes it fun to watch a movie, I would definitely recommend this. As a side note, maybe I will go back and re-watch some of Allen's movies after seeing this one...maybe I shrugged something off as being boring and missed out.",1155254400,2,898,4.515337423312883
2530101,4,B000EQHXNW,"Match Point is a refreshing film and should cause anyone, Woody Allen fan or not, to take notice of Allen's future films.  Especially anything that doesn't feature Allen in his signature comedy/anlayzing life type of work.

Match Point is a slow paced mystery that keeps the viewer wondering what will happen next.  None of the characters create any real emotional connection with the audience; viewers will probably like and dislike them all in one way or another.  But this turns  out to be the genius of the work.  There is no need to become involved on an emotional level with the characters themselves; it is the story itself that keeps one involved. The music, the scenery and the setting are so beautiful and engaging that they, too, contribute to this effect. There really is no ""bad guy"" or ""good guy"" to root for or against.

The tennis ""match point"" theme, and the idea that life is as much about luck as anything else, should have been drawn on a bit more, especially toward the end of the film.  Even resorting to a ""flashback"" memory of the ball teetering on the net (shown at the beginning of the film) would have been a useful device to tantalize the audience about what choice the main character is going make next. This would have caused the suspense level to have been built up a bit earlier on, with more of a transition into the characters' evolution. As it is, the suspense comes on rather suddenly about three quarters of the way through the film.  That is not to imply that the film isn't interesting until then.  It is; things could just have begun sooner.

Some are calling the film ""Hitchcockian"", however it doesn't contain the element of suspense all the way through to equate it with Hitchcock's work. But a similar type of irony used by Hitchcock does exisit and Match Point succeeds in that it leaves one wondering how much of life really is luck.",1155081600,,1879,4.612612612612613
2530102,1,B000EQHXNW,"I am baffled by the overwhelming number of glowing reviews for this movie.  Contrary to what I read, I didn't find the acting scintillating, the script intelligent, and I particularly did not find the plot clever, sexy, or unexpected.

The only interpretation of Match Point I have found even remotely interesting is that it is a modern-day resetting of a classic opera plot.  Opera plots have to be pretty simple: the plot is repeated about 20 times, usually in a foreign tongue in an inhuman register.  Films, however, necessitate a little more depth: the wealthy family is sucessful at 'business.'  What business is it?  Not important if it comes in the middle of a recitative, but rather watery if never explained in a drawing-room discussion.

The film takes the first hour to set the scene, but I can set it for you in one sentence: social climber meets a rich boy with a elligable sister and a hot fiancee.  The great thing is, you can probably fill in the plot arc yourself!  There are absolutely no surprises in the first 2/3 of this film, so save yourself the bland summary of wealthy upper crust Britain, punctuated by intellectual name-dropping (Wow, the wealthy snobs have read Dostoyevski, how illuminating).

The final part of the film could actually be interesting, but the film seems a little too pleased with itself for me to respect it.  I did find it intense when the hero's luck is running out, and the final twist is unexpected, but after an hour and a half of this snooze-fest, it's not enough.  It doesn't make you re-evaluate the entire plot (which is what a good twist ending is supposed to do), instead it's just a lame attempt to attach meaning to a tired tale.",1154908800,12,1689,4.668918918918919
2530103,4,B000EQHXNW,"I've always hoped that some day, some director would get an homage to Hitchcock reasonably right, Here's one, in the form of the almost too clever ""Match Point""--and directed by, of all people, Woody Allen.

Allen understands the principle that the way to create the most suspense is to let the audience in on the ""secret"" (Doris Day waiting for the cymbal player in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"") so that the fun comes with waiting to see how things play out.

Scarlett Johannson, this era's uber-femme, takes the role of the ""Hitchcock Blonde,"" and she's wonderfully pheromonal as Nola, an aggressive brassy-voiced American wannabee actress living in London (180 degrees from her, so far, signature role in ""Lost in Translation""). Jonathan Rhys Meyers is her match as the amoral, social-climbing former tennis touring pro (a salute to ""Strangers on a Train""?), who reads but maybe doesn't quite get the point of Dostoyevsky (clue alert!), and Emily Mortimer takes the role Allen would once have given to Diane Keaton, as Chris's naive wife, Chloe. They inject passion into what are, essentially, cardboard characters (as with Hitchcock, don't waste time supposing that these people are in any sense real).

The last half hour or so, when the plot unfolds with this annoying opera aria on the sound track (it adds to the agita, but you may want to reach for your mute button and turn on the English subtitles), ranks with the best stuff Allen's ever done (and we haven't seen much of his best lately), and he even tacks on one of those tongue-in-cheek ""feel good"" endings Hitchcock opted for (""Vertigo,"" ""Psycho,"" and those monologues at the end of his tv shows).

That's not really true.  Her demands are realistic.  In fact, although Chris is always playing the ""be realistic"" game with Nola, she has much more common sense than he does.  Many critics have said that Jonathan Rhys Meyers should have gotten a Oscar nomination, I disagree.  His acting is never convincing to me.  Scarlet Johansson on the other hand may have just been good enough to get one but even she was not great enough to win.  The story is interesting and the unrealistic ending works because it was artistically crafted, rather than just happening because the writer ran out of ideas.  The end in very disturbing and optimistic, which makes is even more disturbing in my opinion.  Rating wise, I am a little bit surprised that this film got a R rating.  There is NO bad language, only implied violence, and although the movie is about sex, there are no real sex scenes.  I'm not sure how this movie ever got a R rating.  Also I'm not sure how it got categorized as a thriller.  In my opinion, this film is a domestic drama.

With Chole, he has financial stability and true love. Nola is from the ""slums"" of Boulder, Colorado (I live in the Denver metro area and knows it's a rich area).

2530106,5,B000EQHXNW,"I have been a silent witness about the progressive process of Woody Allen's creative maturity. I would say this third stage spans from ""Crimes and misdemeanors"" until this rounded masterpiece ""Match point."" Woody has recurred to emblematic metaphors (such the brilliant ""Mighty Aphrodite"", to acidic plots such Deconstructing Harry or self-biographic approaches in ""Celebrity"")  Allen has made a journey inside the human soul, its fears and anguishes. And I must recognize this emblematic and opened tribute to Dostoievsky with ""Crime and punishment"" was revitalized and modernized with mesmerizing results.

Chris Walton is a mysterious newcomer, who thanks to his kind manners and magnetic presence has reached the peak in the social status. All of us ignore his origins, but we are aware about his ambition, his love for power, the delights  the good life in pursuit of achieve the coveted status, but without renounce to his hidden passion: the verboten fruit. As a matter of fact, he loves to be placed in the best of both worlds. To maintain his status and enjoy this risky love affair.

As you may guess, this intriguing situation will reach its boiling point through a definitive resolution, where the lucky factor (as smartly is graphically established in the opening shots) seems to determine the punishment is merely a random choice, where the ferocious determination may become the difference that makes the difference.

You should scrutinize how the ethics, as well as any human consideration, or a tennis ball may work out of one side of the ground and not necessarily on the opposite one.

But Walton unconsciously, seems to act according that reminded personage of Karamazov Brothers: ""If God does not exist, then all is permitted.""

This story has been done before about a cad trying to reach the top by marrying a wealthy heiress while chasing after a would-be actress, with no scruples whatsoever.

No surprises in this film, only surprise at how boring Woody Allen's movies are and how non-talented actresses like Johanssen can rise to the top.",1154304000,12,665,4.483333333333333
2530108,4,B000EQHXNW,"Woody Allen inspires passionate discussion, mind-boggling intellectualization, expert opinion, and unfettered ranting. You could spend the rest of your life studying his films - I believe I saw that someone is researching a Ph. D. thesis on the use of opera in ""Match Point."" Someone, somewhere, is preparing the definitive comparison of ""Match Point"" with ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" and will hopefully put all related questions to rest. And don't even mention New York vs London.

Well, I have seen a few Woody Allen films, enjoyed many of them, and have largely forgotten most since ""The Purple Rose of Cairo."" I wouldn't be a very respected member of the discussion circle. But I enjoyed this film a lot. Among other things, I think it is well-written, well-acted, and has a lot of techniques that remind me of the Woody Allen films I enjoyed so much. Like when Chris, the protagonist, encounters someone he knows on the street and starts talking to them - but you don't see them until they walk into the camera's range. Little things like that. The film doesn't have a traditional Hollywood ending, in my opinion, and I thought it was very fitting that opera played such a key role. The few opera librettos that I have seen are really very simple as stories, and don't demand a lot of thinking on the part of the listeners/viewers. The film revolves around the role of chance, or luck, in certain key events of life, and - on an individual basis - I think it's an interesting point. And a bonus: now I know why the Italian custodians at school used to listen to opera all night while cleaning the classrooms. That alone makes the film worth seeing.

I found a few things a little stretch in credibility: I don't think a ruling class family as wealthy and established as the Hewitts would be quite so susceptible to the intrusion of ""lower-class"" outsiders. But warning: everything I know about the personal behavior of rich people I learned from watching The Gilmore Girls. And I found Nola, the character played by Scarlet Johanssen, to be a little hard to believe. She morphs from a self-confident flirt at the beginning to a desperate victim at the end, without any clear line of development, although the ping-pong game foretells how the relationship will proceed. Nola is such a key player, but I find her somewhat unconvincing, perhaps more due to ellipses in the script than to problems with her acting. But it's an opera - the story is superficial, there are dramatic clashes, big emotions, ruling class figures, sex and passion. Just like the online discussion about the movie. Funny, Yogi, but I don't remember if a fat lady sings at the end or not. Oh well, that's the way the cookie crumbles. Wait - wrong metaphor.",1154304000,6,2731,4.747368421052632

The acting was needlessly amatuer. Can't anyone see the holes in SJ's performance? The scene were she is ""drunk""? i wanted to grab her and say ""please stop wiggling your head and rolling your eyes"". Was that Woody's direction? AMAZING! hands clapping! encore! snore/yawn...

2530110,3,B000EQHXNW,"The last Woody Allen movie I saw was Everyone Says I Love You which wasn't exactly the best way to spend an evening. Since then I've kind of avoided his movies since they're usually the same thing. On a recent rental check, the only thing that even remotely interested me was Match Point so I thought ""meh, why not?"" Well turns out it's 0 for...I don't know how many movies he's got but I didn't really like this one.

Chris(Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is a former tennis pro living in London. He meets Tom and Chloe(Emily Mortimer) who instantly falls for Chris. They begin a courtship until Chris meets Tom's fiance Nola(Scarlett Johanssen). Chris very much likes Nola but he's with Chloe but that doesn't stop him from starting an affair which makes you wonder how exactly do you stop a marriage from falling apart when you have a mistress.

In watching the film, 2 things struck me: how oddball the editing is and how the writing didn't strike me that much. Little scenes happen here and there to give some ""insight"" into character's lives but they're so fleeting they don't really give you anything. Ooh a character reads a book, so they like to read! A character has a quick thing at the office so he must be busy! But that's all it is, it's a lazy attempt at giving character's some added depth where the writing failed. But then we get scenes that kind of go on forever that don't reveal anything. Doesn't help that the writing is kind of stagnant and the delivery is worse.

Where the film does pick up though is how Chris deals with his problem which is quite gritty and raw. However there is some plotholes that are easy to figure out if you think about it. But it does present a good anti-adultery message, especially when pregnancy is involved. In a weird way it does come out of left field since the film's so talky than it becomes, I don't know, a Coppola movie for one scene.

Is there much good in this film? Well the ending and the turn Chris' character takes is good but everything else leading up to it is so plain that I actually started to play guitar and read while the movie was playing. It's clearly a love it or hate it film and I know I didn't love it.",1153958400,5,2173,4.41147132169576
2530111,1,B000EQHXNW,"I was looking forward to this movie because Scarlet Johansson is in it.  I've enjoyed her work so far.  The fact that Woody Allen made this movie made it even more enticing.  And when I saw that Brian Cox (one of my favorite actors thanks to the Borne Idenity and Supremacy) was in the film, I snatched it up straight away.  But people please hear me when I say this:  This movie is the worst picture I've seen in a long time.  I was surprised to see so many positive reviews and that this film is ranked as one of Amazon's ""Best DVD's of the Year so Far.""  Heck maybe I'm the crazy one.  However,

1.  The entire dialogue was forced, false, and over-acted.  Too intricate to be spoken with any personality.  You could almost sense the actors focusing on the lines vice trying to stay in character.

2.  The interactions between characters were tedius and boring.  I can understand foreshadowing and character development through conversation but it was again way too overdone.  I kept feeling the same thing through every scene, ""Come on already!  Tell the story!""

3.  The upper class family that Chris was so desparate to be a part of was painfully prim, proper, and downright annoying to watch.  Why not, for the sake of the movie, especially in having Brian Cox cast as the father, insert a little humor into their goings on?  It didn't have to be a ""Wedding Crashers"" type representation upper class comedy, but a little bit would have held my interest better. Every time the rich family was on screen they doted around doing what rich people do, wearing rich people clothes, but without personality or depth.  It seemed lazy on the film maker part to have them only represent extreme wealth, snoot-iness and nothing more.

4.  The length of the film was way too long, thanks to the intricate dialouge and run on scenes.  It seemed as if Woody had ultimate control of the editing and decided to keep every inch of stock on the reel for the theatrical release.

5.  With everything listed above, the plot of this movie became entirely too predictable, leaving me with a feeling that the film maker deemed his audience naive and downright stupid. To the point where everything had to be laid out accross the screen in a manner that a 5 year old could follow along.

I'm sure there is a population of Woody Allen fans who adore this movie, and this review isn't intended to sway or downplay their appreciation or opinion of him.  But for the layman, the everyman, allow me to recommend that you let this movie sit on the shelf, it's not worth the money.",1153872000,25,2556,4.543859649122807
2530112,4,B000EQHXNW,"First of all i must say that as many of you, i think the film is worth the watch only because of Scarlett Johansson, she is a very good actress.  If you like Scarlett Johansson or Woody Allen's work, you may say the film writing, directing, and acting is EXCELLENT, but rather than being excellent, at some points the film turns to be very naive, I really liked the film a lot, even the ending cliche, but being objective there are many things that left all of us with big Doubts.

SPOILER WARNING (don't read here if you haven't watched the film)

as other reviwers i really disagree with the british police ""investigation"".
they are supossed to do an autopsy right?
couldn't they found out that Nola was pregnant?
nobody heard 2 shotgun shots? they must be deft...
Nola told her friend at the Boutique about Chris, and who knows, maybe all the details about their relationship, and the police never talked to her... that's very annoying.
Those details are very very clumpsy, it is hard to believe that such a intelligent man like woody allen made those mistakes (even if it was on purpose) i don't care, it's stupid.

i really liked the first hour and a half, but then... you jump into the world of Chris, the luckiest irish in the UK.  better have luck than being good. Who Knows.

without those details i think it is a very good film, so many fine details, common of Woody Allen.

2530113,2,B000EQHXNW,"I do not know exactly what I had expected the title to mean, but whatever it was, I was wrong. I think I had imagined something having to do with matches and fire. The title, I thought, was perfect for the film. It is a reference to the game of tennis where either in your favor or against you, the fate of the match potentially rests in the outcome of this one point. It could go either way. The theme from the movie that each situation, each conversation, could go either way depending on nothing more than a whim, was pulled together with those two words which combine as figurehead for the movie. I liked that a lot. And over the 2 hours and 4 minutes at which Match Point weighs in, I liked almost nothing else.

I did like the performance by Matthew Goode who played Tom Hewett. He is sort of...if Hugh Grant and Tom Cavanagh had a baby. Charming, British and yet gangly and awkward.

I was not at all impressed with Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Though as I recall, the good things I had heard from my sister-in-law may not have mentioned anything beyond his good looks. I thought his acting was forced and choppy. As the movie began I thought his acting would ruin the movie. Then I remembered that Scarlett Johansson was in it, too. (That means it would be her acting that would stand out as the low-point.) He seemed overly dramatic at times as if his talent may be more fitting for on-stage rather than on-screen. Besides, he looks and sounds a little too much like Joaquin Phoenix (think about it).

Just as she does in all of her movies, Ms. Johansson underwhelmed me yet again. Her delivery seems completely devoid of emotion and a passion for her craft. It is probably best noted from her performance in In Good Company, but it surfaced again here. I have seen the same lists as you, where she is listed near the top of the hottest and the sexiest actors. I have read the same articles as you, where she is touted as the first and only actress to define our generation with her grace and natural ability while the camera rolls. I just have not seen it for myself. To me she is best suited for awkward, angsty teen roles like the one she played in Ghost World.

I was just reading an IMDb forum spoiler discussion on the movie and someone pointed out an interesting parallel between one of the characters in the film and a book read by one of the characters. I love subtle references like this, even when, like this one, I have not read the book. Kudos to Woody Allen for that.

I wish I could give Mr. Allen more credit in my thoughts on his work. I have not seen what many consider his best films, but of the others I have seen I have not been a fan. To that point, however, some have gone so far as to call Match Point his crowning achievement. I guess I just do not understand his genius. So many people talk about what the man is able to do and it must be entirely over my head.

The synopsis provided with the DVD mentions mystery where the only real mystery was when was the movie going to finally end. It also includes a quote that refers to Match Point as one of the most erotic movies in years. The most erotic point was when Rhys-Meyers was saturating Ms. Johansson with massage oil. She's completely covered from the viewer's standpoint and looks like she needs a magazine to cure her boredom. It looked like the cover from a cheap steamy-romance novel. I say cheap because I bet Rhys-Meyers's scrawny frame doesn't tip the scales at more than 160 pounds.

Regardless of lofty promises and salesmanship on behalf of the promoters of the DVD, the movie was a disappointment. I cannot remember a time when I have had such an urge to get up and turn off a movie. And I probably would have had I not been entertaining guests. Match Point, or as I affectionately refer to it: ""The Movie That Never Ends,"" seemed to really drag on and on.",1153785600,12,3850,4.346314325452017
2530114,3,B000EQHXNW,"As many have already said:

1) The central twist of the movie has already been seen.  What makes Crimes and Misdemeanors so original is the idea that bad guys don't always get caught.  Any repeat of that theme will lack originality.  Crimes and Misdemeanors is brilliant, and eliminates the need for this movie altogether.

2) The plot, and character motivations, display too many holes in order to arrive at the punchline.  ""I'm a tennis player, and I'm in this love triangle.  My wife asked me if I'm having an affair.  If I tell the truth, she'll be upset and get over it quickly.  But it would be much more interesting to do away with the one I really love.  The guilt thing is a blast!""  ""I'm a detective, and I've figured out this crime.  But the lady's ring was found on someone else.  I might as well just drop the case.""  ""I'm a beautiful woman, and this guy is madly in love with me. The entire movie audience is pulling for me.  I think I'll become a shrill bitch and drive him to murder.""

What makes the movie somewhat sickening is the realism of the murders.  The victims get, oh, a half second to realize their fate.  So hum drum, like being shot in your sleep.  The writer and director of the movie seems to be taking a morally neutral stance on these murders.  That's sickening.

Nonetheless, the movie is well crafted.  The dialogue seems real, and that's a Woodie Allen strength that few can match.",1153440000,7,1417,4.453125

One of his students is a wealthy man about his age, who takes an immediate liking to Chris, especially when he finds Chris is fond of opera.  He invites Chris to the opera to share his family's box.  At the opera, the man's sister (Cloe) takes and immediate liking to Chris.  Pretty soon they are dating.  Chris seems to be real happy and since Cloe's family likes Chris too, Cloe's father offers Chris a high level job in one of his companies.  This seems to be the rags to riches story until he meets his friend's fiance Nola (Scarlett Johannsen) and immediately is overpowered by her looks.  The four periodically double date and Chris and Nola seem to flirt with each other when they can.

His infatuation with Nola seems pretty evident when he shows his immediate disappointment when Cloe turns down a double date.  Chris hems and haws but finally convinces Cloe to accept the date.  His night gets ruined though because Nola fails to show up due to a headache.

One day on the parents estate, Chris and Cloe get entangled in a secret tryst.  With that behind them, Chris is due to be married to Cloe and seems to be doing quite well as an executive in her father's company.  Nola and her fiance break up and Chris cannot go on with enjoying what he has.  Instead he tries to track down Nola who has left the country.

Chris and Cloe get married and they immediately start trying to have a baby.  It becomes an obsession for Cloe who wants three.  One day while wandering an art gallery with Cloe, Chris espies Nola walking.  She apparently has returned.  Chris decides to take the plunge that will only lead to ruin to his seemingly ""perfect"" life and pursues Nola.

2530116,4,B000EQHXNW,"It may appear that Woody Allen watched a little too much Wimbledon before writing this movie, but we can forgive him for that.  Stories of love triangles with tennis imagery would not normally seem to go together too well, but Allen does draw the audience into this story.  One can even make the argument that the fellow himself is somewhat like a tennis ball being batted between two women.

In my book, any film that stars Scarlett Johansson gets an automatic 3 stars right off the bat.  Fans of her work will enjoy this film.  She plays a character that is far more luscious than the demure, naive girl in LOST IN TRANSLATION.  She's a diversified actress who proves she can go in any direction necessary to give a good portrayal.

2530120,5,B000EQHXNW,"Woody Allen's ""Match Point"" is reminiscent----in the best possible sense----of those well-crafted and entertaining films that used to be released not only by Hollywood but also by London. The scenario is informed by movies such as ""Room at the Top"" with its social-climbing anti-hero on the one hand and those ironic British mysteries in which crime pays----to a certain extent----on the other. Allen's plot and characterizations have also been crafted with an intricacy and psychological insight that would do Agatha Christie proud.

I do not want to give away Allen's ironic twist, clues of which are provided both in the title and in the DVD cover, other than to say that it is a stunner!

Instead of wasting time, money, and gas to drive to the cineplex and watch the same old Hollywood summer blockbusters, purchase this DVD, stay home, and enjoy an armchair visit to England for a glimpse of a fascinating world to which one----in the shoes of Allen's antihero----might easily become accustomed.",1152316800,3,1001,5.0606060606060606

He is so good at portraying a demented, obsessive or possessed character.  This film is worth watching.  But, I have a major offense against the ending of the film.  When there was a crime such as murder occurred, shouldn't the investigation started by performing an autopsy on the victim's body.  If the police had done so, they would have discovered the REAL motive for the murder.  It just seemed so implausible unless British policemen are always doing such a clumsy job.

2530122,5,B000EQHXNW,"Over the years, there have been a limited number of movies that left me stunned: not in the sense of being shocked but in the sense of being overwhelmed by a powerful message. It's a solid clue that the movie you just saw was some sort of a masterpiece.  I had known ahead of time that Woody Allen was very pleased with how ""Match Point"" had turned out even to the point of suggesting that it was his greatest movie.  As a fan of Allen's movies, I took that as quite a recommendation.  However, I had no other advance information about the movie except that it involved tennis.

I won't attempt to try and spell out the plot because I enjoyed the movie as much as I did by not having any preconceptions.  However, it is a morality play that examines the role of fate (luck) in our lives.  As the movies unfolds and the characters develop, we find ourselves getting involved with the ""hero"".  We agonize over his decisions and his behavior primarily because the director enabled us to know him so well.  If, at times, the movie seems to creep along, it is because Allen knows how to properly set the stage.  When things do happen quickly, everything we've learned comes into play and we are rewarded for our attentiveness.

This is a movie where you find yourself knowing what you'd do in the same situation but agonizing over what the main character will do.  A mistake born of passion grows out of control.  Where will it end.  Where DID it end?

""Match Point"" is a movie for those who want to be drawn into a dramatic look at the casualties of our passions.  It reminded me of Allen's ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" but even better.",1152057600,4,1629,4.437710437710438
2530123,2,B000EQHXNW,"I do not normally review movies although I watch probably close to a hundred films every year and have done so for decades. I have enjoyed many many Woody Allen films from his earliest comedies on thru his later dramas.

Match Point, at least on initial viewing, does nothing for his resume. To be sure, there are some great moments in the film. I feel the early flirtatious conversations between Johannson and Meyers are almost classic. In some ways, I would compare them with the conversations between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint in North by Northwest. Their conversations are obvertly sexual without being the least bit profane or vulgar. They are adult in the best sense of that word. The acting and the writing of these scenes are perfect and only add to the disappointment of the rest of the film.

My first negative point is the character played by Emily Mortimer. Mortimer fails to convince me that her character would be as bland and clueless as she seems to be. Since I think of Mortimer as being a reliable actress I tend to blame the script in part for this failure.

But the first real sin of the film is its utter predictability. I turned to my wife after Meyers and Johannson renewed their affair and predicted the rest of the film. (Spoiler alert- read no further if you have not seen the film and still give a hoot about the so-called ""twist"").

 I did not foresee, however, the murder of the landlady. That combined with the murder of Johannson's character is the origin of the ""disgusting"" in my title (the second real sin of the film). These are not the actions of an existentialist. Existentialists are, on the whole, if you actually read them, a rather responsible lot. The murders might be the actions of a nihilist or a sad, weak coward. Or the type of guy who would leave his long time partner for a much much younger woman.

I guess what I am saying is that in many ways this film is a good metaphor for Allen himself. Very smart at times, very glossy but with no real moral center at all. It makes me sad to say this after all these years but my reaction to the next Woody Allen film will be indifference.",1151798400,10,2135,4.461538461538462
2530124,5,B000EQHXNW,"Being a great fan of Woody Allen, I have most of his films, not only the classic ones, but also his newer films.  From his previous films, I knew that he had been successful in dramas just as well,  although comedy has always been the area where he excelled.  Match Point expresses the maturity and a sense of zen in the career of a master director.  It is a film which flows effortlessly from the beginning to the end, where the background (London) becomes a perfect setting for the plot (much like a Hitchcock film).  Actually, the film resembles a Hitchcock film in many ways, from the suspense that builds gradually towards the end, the constant expectation that any minute Chris's relationship will be revealed, to Allen's excellent use of music throughout the film.

Although the plot is one of the most well known and repeated cliches in film making, it is astonishing how  Woody Allen has presented it with such freshness. In a true Shakespearean manner, the film is built on a number of classic themes going parallel to each other: human weaknesses; the conflict between a comfortable but not so exciting family life vs. the passion felt towards another woman; infidelity; the role of chance in changing one's life; feelings of guilt; ambition and obsession ...  The scenes where the family gathers to discuss family matters and party scenes -which are always Allen's favorite-contribute to the overall cohesiveness of the film.

I see Match Point as a brilliant work of art accomplished during the later stages in the life of a true master director, Woody Allen.",1151539200,9,1572,4.835820895522388
2530125,3,B000EQHXNW,"Judging by Jonathan Rhys Meyers' (Chris Wilton) choice of reading material early in his climber (that would be social, not rock) days, Woody wants to invoke Dostoevsky.  And yes, there is a bit of Crime and Punishment here, also Crimes and Misdemeanors, also lesser Hitchcock, but mostly it's 2/3 The Talented Mr. Ripley, with a third An American Tragedy and a little twist at the end.  Way too long at over two hours and with Rhys Meyers at his smarmiest (which, to be fair, is precisely what he is supposed to be) Match Point is chiefly enjoyable for the last half hour and the way Scarlett Johansson burns through her part and the movie.  See it for her, but for not much else.",1151452800,6,680,4.512195121951219
2530126,2,B000EQHXNW,"This film was heralded as Woody Allen's comeback though it's hard to see why. I know many people loved it which was why I was excited to see it but it's such a disappointment. Match Point opens fairly strongly with Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) applying for a position as a tennis instructor at a ritzy country club. He's hired. One of his pupils is Tom Hewlett, the playboy son of a wealthy family. The two hit it off (they both share a love of opera). Tom invites Chris to join him for an opera performance with his family, and thus Chris is inducted into the high society Britain. He meets, Chloe, Chris's sister who falls instantly in love with him. It seems that Chris is about to find himself in an exceedingly comfortable lifestyle. The movie springs along until Tom's finace Nola (Scarlett Johansson) arrives. Chris and Nola two start an ill-advised romance and it's trouble from there on out.

The characters, although played by exceedingly attractive young actors, fail to grab your attention. The actors fail to convey the depth necessary for the roles. Scarlett johanssan, who's portrayal was heralded, particularly disappointed me by how awful she was. Although she looks the part, she's too self-conscious. I could see her trying to be sexy and jaded throughout the entire movie. Rhys-Meyers fares slightly better. There are moments where he oozes charm and one can see why the Hewletts are instantly drawn to him. Yet in somber moments he too seems be forcing it.

Then there's the plot...in this type of movie, the plot matters. And in the last third of this movie the plot is so full of holes...well you'll have to see for yourself but I cannot understand how people could rave about this movie given what happens. Even if the previous parts had been decent it would not have made up for the mess of the last third.

The movie is stylish without a doubt. And the premise of it was promising, but the execution was clumsy. The acting by the leads (Johansson and Rhys-Meyers) was second rate, though I suspect that may be more the director's fault because I have seen them act better in other roles; the supporting cast was able if not particularly noteworthy.",1151193600,15,2181,4.734210526315789

But on the other, the story is nothing new and it made me squirm in my seat.  Meyers plays a tennis pro who falls in love with a lovely, but naive, British aristocrat played by Emily Mortimer.  They marry and Meyers gets a cushy job working for his father-in-law.  Of course he risks it all by having an affair with Johansson's character.  The movie was good enough to get me to care about Meyers-I found myself hoping he would not get caught.  But the movie really didn't have anything new to say. At least it didn't have the typical happy Hollywood ending.  If about 15 minutes were shaved off, I would probably have given it 4 stars.",1150761600,6,741,4.397058823529412

2530135,4,B000EQHXNW,"As already said, this follows the story of a young tennis pro turned upper class leech.  The story flows slowly, but is thoroughly engrossing.  The performances are great- (except I think Johansson's performance is hampered by poor writing, relying too much on her beauty and her being American, her character is soundly flat) - the rich mother is a baiting harpy - Brian Cox is great, as usual, as the benevolent patriarch- the rich children are boring and shallow (though the son has the most important lines- eg. the discussion in the bar about hard work vs. his comments at the end about what he wants for his nephew- trying to be vague!) - and, despite a genuine charm and appeal, you never fully understand the main character's sincerity and motivation - which allows the movie to maintain an ambiguous tone.

The morally ambiguous tone is what really makes the movie interesting and worth a renting- you may be surprised by its thoughtfulness.  As they make FAR TOO obvious, the movie is a modern interpretation/manipulation/rewrite of Crime and Punishment (great book!).  Instead of following Dostoyevsky's theme of morality (sorry to simplify a great book!), it follows the theme of chance- not just in how it affects our 'success', but also how it affects our moral make-up.  What I found interesting is that the movie is a sort of reverse Crime and Punishment, but a reverse of someone who would read the book as though it was a precursor to Horatio Algers ideology (luck vs. hard work).  It fails (or intentionally avoids?) much of the religious-moral discussion.  Of course, the main character fails to understand the book as well, which I think is the point of the scene where he is attempting to read it.

If you have never read C&P (and if you didn't, do so!- I'm not religious and the book is, but I loved it!)...if you haven't read it, you may not appreciate the slight manipulations of plot and theme and you'll totally miss the importance of the detectives.  If you have read it, then you may be bothered how it uses C&P as a guide, but neither comes close enough to the story to satisfy the relationsonship - nor stray far enough to stake out its own thematic commentary.",1150243200,3,2192,4.714659685863874

2530139,2,B000EQHXNW,"I feel I was duped into watching ""Match Point"" by a professional reviewing corps willing, urging and openly rooting for Woody Allen to come out with something resembling good product.  The movie flat-out does not compare in any way to the glowing reviews you've seen thrown around.  To the contrary, it was an excruciating viewing experience.  The few viewers here on these pages with the guts to call it out have it right: this is soap-opera quality stuff with appalling bad and stilted dialogue.  Plus, Allen needs an editor to push back on him: the movie is overly-long by at least 20 minutes.  My wife and I were inventing reasons to leave the room (must brush teeth; do plants need watering?) only to come back five minutes later and find nothing meaningful had transpired.

Plus, I'm in agreement with the reviewer here who picks up on the unreasonability of the film's overlauded ""non-Hollywood ending"":  the police run an investigation and don't bother talking to Nola's co-worker?  We see a critical small scene where Nola indicates she's meeting with Chris that night.  Let's review: it's obvious from that quick scene that the romance with Chris is a recurring topic; the scene establishes that the co-worker knows there's a meeting that evening; and the investigators are savvy enough to have found and mined Nola's diary.  You're telling me they didn't interview the co-worker?  Give me a break.",1149897600,14,1408,4.948936170212766
2530140,3,B000EQHXNW,"Yes, it's a return to pretty-good film-making for Woddy Allen, but not as wondrous as critics would have you believe.  First, Scarlett J. is perhaps miscast, not because she doesn't do well -- she is a marvel to behold and to listen to, with the dusky voice -- but she is too young to be washed-up in her career, as we are supposed to believe, and too lovely to be rejected by any man.  Second, the plot takes a terrible turn toward genre when our hero decides to kill his mistress, rather than, well, doing something else to resolve his problem.  CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS went down the same plot road, but it made sense in that film.  It didn't fit this film, and the plot overruled the excellent characterization which Woody had accomplished to that point.",1149811200,10,757,4.544117647058823
2530141,3,B000EQHXNW,"It's obvious that Woody Allen has a penchant for Russian literature, especially with Dostoevsky. This is all fine and dandy, but he already basically the same plot line with Crimes and Misdemeanors. With slight alterations, change of locale and personnel, viola you have new movie. Or you have the same movie with different fleas.
The performances and acting are great overall, with Jonathan Rhys and Billy Cox taking the lead. It's Scarlett's performance which leaves much to be desired. She is out of her league with acting of this caliber and does not fit in.
Of course, movies in general do not come close to the depth of the novel, nor should they. Crime and Punishment is a work of great spiritual and psychological detail. Moreover, the main character has a much greater moral dilemma to deal with. The kinds of problems that Allen's characters have to deal with pale in comparison.
In a way, Allen tries to make his criminals look excusable for what they did. But it really is hard to forgive a married man for infidelity and murder. It's not very far reaching in its implications and doesn't really have a cosmic ring to it.
I suppose this kind of movie is considered sophisticated in this day and age, where people don't read or understand literature. And Allen is no exception or else he would not have taken such creative license with such an important literary work. It only scratches the bare surface of the great Russian novels, and in the end does them a great injustice.
Movies are much better off on their own, than alluding to great writings that require much more time and work to understand. Match Point is one of those movies.",1149638400,8,1648,4.705882352941177

This film is mostly a rehash of the ideas and scenes from Woody's earlier films, and if you've seen them, then this one isn't worth your time.",1149552000,9,339,4.396825396825397
2530143,4,B000EQHXNW,"MATCH POINT is a Woody Allen film without Woody Allen and reminds me of his CRIMES AND MISDEMEANERS. MATCH POINT has that same theme of a man entangled with two women and having to choose between good and evil as did CRIMES. It has that same serious, melancholy feeling to it as well. In both cases, things work out but don't end well. In MATCH POINT we have an ex-tennis pro from humble a background named Chris who becomes involved with Chloe, a rich girl. But then Chris meets meets Nola, the girlfriend of his potentially future brother-in-law. He is much more attracted to Nola but marriage to Chloe promises a properous and comfortable life for him. It's a hard choice, usually made by attractive women who pick wealthy men over better-looking alternatives. Although, perhaps in the case of women, sex appeal is not as important as security. For men, sexual attraction is very high on their list if not at the top. So, in a way, MATCH POINT is formulated on shaky psychological/sociological grounds, namely, that a man like Chris would give up good sex for lots of money. Think about it: Chris is attractive, already a successful tennis player, could make a decent living as a tennis pro and is sharp enough to do any number of things. Yet, he seems intent on being rich. And while being rich is the apparent motivation for his later moral choices, to me there doesn't seem to be much development of that motivation in the script. All we know is that Chris came from a modest background. Apparently, he is just lazy and doesn't really want to work. That is certainly a character flaw behind many an evil deed. But that is only my guess; it would be nice to have that idea, if true for the character, developed more in the screenplay. We are talking about some serious stuff here and at the end we really don't understand why Chris behaved as he did. Still, this is just a fun quibble. MATCH POINT is a good film and I'm glad to see Woody Allen back making good films once again.",1149552000,3,1984,4.513888888888889

You could see the ending coming a mile away, and the more the story went on, the more despicable Johnathan Rhys Meyers' character Chris became.  Maybe this was a comedy, because Allen actually expects people too root for someone this shallow and evil?  Another case in point is that the police working on the murder of his mistress Nola (Scarlett Johansson) and the poor, innocent lady downstairs conducted the sloppiest detective work since Jon Bonet Ramsey.  The girl at the boutique who knew about Nola seeing Chris, and the man he banged into on the street after committing the crime were never questioned?  Worst of all is the ending.  If Woody Allen is morally depraved enough to glorify unpunished murderers, let him, but as far as this viewer is concerned his loyal fans of his can have him.",1149465600,8,976,4.733727810650888

You would be hard pressed to find another individual that acts, directs, and writes screenplays such as this.  Especially when you factor in the ease in which Woody handles a variety of genres, from drama, to comedy, to this British thriller.

This movie had an excellent pace, and was very well acted.  Johannsen is a gorgeous woman that came into her own in this film.

2530146,5,B000EQHXNW,"It is strange but, the way movies are announced sometimes helps in  losing you. The marketing of Match Point emphasized the setting of this movie within the London upper class society and the relation between two couples: I was highly surprised when I found it was indeed a crime thriller, a genre very much in vogue again nowadays.  In the best way the movie deals with the story of a social climber and in one line his future brother in law uses clearly the word hustler, a hustler who plays by chance.  (Wait to see who wins).

Full of many literary, artistic, sports (the metaphor of the net is so good) and musical references very well crafted by Woody Allen (a connosieur), the movie also includes its victims  (whose names I don't tell) clues are given to you.  By the way, I keep saying when watching ""someone is going to die here""...

A superb performance by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and an excellent appearance by Scarlett Johansson as an American aspiring actress, lost in this upper class greed.

Basically, Chris has an affair w/ Nola and gets her pregnant.  So what does this guy do?  He basically tries to buy time to figure out which girl matters to him most.  His final decision: Kill the neighbor and then shoot Nola dead.  At the end?  Chris gets away with murder and the film ends right there?!?!?  What?!?!?  It's obvious Scarlett's character had some bad luck and you feel bad for her cause honestly, Chris was simply using her.  When Nola gets the call from him about good news, you want something good to happen to her.  Then she was killed by him.

You expect to see some kind of resolution, at least a decent ending.  What you get was nothing, because this movie offers nothing for you to experience.

First, the movie depicts the modern, affluent side of London - the new London Gherkin (Sir Norman Foster), the Advant Garde dream apartment with floor-to-ceiling window overlooking a majestic bridge in blue waters, the beautiful country house to spend a weekend away from the city.

Second, the plot involves money, love, murder; all because of the fact that this young man Chris Wilton is on his way to reach the top rung of the social ladder by all means. And the opening scene where a tennis ball lingered above the net, about to decide which side it will fall on, nicely echoes the shot near the end where the critical diamond ring lingered above the fence, about to decide the fate of the young man.

Third, Scarlett Johansson as Nora is a natural beauty who captures every scene in a seemingly effortless and unpretentious way. Nora is a head-to-heel romantic. She is as uncalculating as Chris is scheming against anyone who gets in his way.

Now after watching the 2 hour and four minute film, my thoughts on the movie are slightly tainted. I very much enjoyed the devilish plot, teeming with scandal and suspense, but the conclusion just didn't sit well with me. The ending seemed completely cold to me. I didn't get any resolution whatsoever. Jonathan Rhys Meyers' character was the most complex and complicated to understand, even though his actions were quite predictable (I saw the whole 'murder & robbery' play out in my mind twenty minutes before it happened). Aside from the ending, I very much enjoyed the movie. The acting was just stupendous, preferably in regards to Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. I do recomend this movie to those who love a good scandalous drama, but be aware the ending is still very scandalous, however unsatisfying it may be.",1149292800,2,972,4.969325153374233
2530150,3,B000EQHXNW,"This film has a couple of things going for it:

1.  Strong cast, very telegenic leads in Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, and Emily Mortimer; beautiful settings and cinematography --- a pleasure to watch!

2.  Beautiful operatic score, a departure from Allen's usual jazzy scores --- very easy on the ears!

3.  Nice dark unifying theme: the universe being run by blind chance rather than any rhyme or reason.  The ending, in which a crime goes unsolved out of sheer dumb luck on the part of the culprit, almost salvaged the rest of the film.

Now, the bad news:

1.  Undoubtedly one of Woody Allen's worst scripts in years.  The dialogue is often just downright AWFUL in many places, sticking out like a sore thumb, totally written-sounding and contrived.

2.  A very soap opera-like plotline, full of predictable melodrama and potboiler hooks, with emotional peaks and crises you can see coming a hundred miles away ... drearily prosaic stuff esp. considering Allen's body of work.  Luckily the last 1/4 of the film does become at least a LITTLE creative.

3.  No satisfying carnal scenes between Johanssen and Meyers.  In fact, zero nudity not even the PG-13 variety --- very huge SIGH there...

I usually agree with Roger Ebert, but for him to put this film in the same pantheon as ""Annie Hall"" and other true masterpieces by Allen, is truly puzzling.",1149206400,8,1364,4.8311688311688314
2530151,5,B000EQHXNW,"Luck trumps all in Match Point, the brilliantly dark latest film by director Woody Allen.

 For Match Point, Allen leaves his comfort zone of neurotic comedy and New York City to explore the dramatic possibilities of grey, upper class London. The result: a story with a twist unlike any Allen has told before. And with parallels to Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, it will likely leave a foul taste in your mouth.

 The story centers on the clever and brooding Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a poor tennis instructor from Ireland trying to climb the ranks of English high society. Meyers acts with such menace that it will thoroughly shock fans of Bend It Like Beckham, in which Meyers plays the amazingly perfect heartthrob coach of a women's soccer team.

 Chris reads Dostoevsky and plays his hand to its greatest advantage, wooing a sweet rich girl, Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Things get complicated, however, when Chris meets his match in the form of the seductive Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), whose sexual confidence causes her to proclaim that men find her ""sexy"" though not necessarily ""beautiful.""

 The provocative and attractive nature of the actors enhances the passion between Wilton and Rice, and the chemistry between Meyers and Johansson is undeniable. In one scene, Chris confronts Nola in the gardens of an English countryside estate. In the middle of the pouring rain, the setting is dreary yet beautiful. Dripping wet, the pair lustfully explores their passion for one another.

 Allen doesn't completely abandon his comedic flair, however, and Match Point has its share of dry comedy. Most comes in the form of subtle cracks at the excessive nature of the upper class lifestyle. The pairing of actors Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton as Chloe's parents makes for a few laughs, with lines like, ""Eleanor, I think you have had one too many G and T's.""

 Nineteenth century opera on scratchy early twentieth century recordings provides a fitting score and gives the film a classically old but treasured vibe. And Match Point is a classic in its own right, proving that even well into his prime, Woody Allen still has some luck in him yet.",1149120000,2,2161,4.972222222222222
2530152,4,B000EQHXNW,"It sounds like a stretch, I know, but I think Woody Allen may have made a political allegory with this film.  The clue is a few specific words during dialogue in the penultimate scene with Jonathan Rhys Meyers (as Chris Wilton) where he discusses what has happened (or ponders it--a particularly eerie part of the film).  I'm inclined to see the story as more than a morality tale because of that clue.  As others have noted, one of the most intriguing things about this movie is the presence of hints throughout, so it would not surprise me to find out that the plot is a comment on particular real contemporary events. Judge for yourself (I won't say what I think it is about).

Beyond that, there is no question the film is very good. It makes the viewer uncomfortable on several levels, one indication of its worth as art. There was only a moment when I was not absolutely glued to the script. At one point Jonathan Rhys Meyers, whose acting is top-notch here, delivers a line that brought a chuckle that was certainly not intended. My wife and I both noticed it at the same time. He utters an urgent appeal that is word-for-word from the mouth of his character Cassander in the film Alexander, and worse, his enuciation is precisely the same as well. It jolted me out of this film and into a scene in Alexander--I've never had that happen except maybe when watching old John Wayne movies.  Still this is a good film, and it increases my respect for Woody Allen.",1148860800,5,1466,4.516981132075472
2530153,5,B000EQHXNW,"There can be no doubt that Woody Allen is a talented filmmaker, but there can also be no doubt that his last few films have been tragic missteps (although I liked ""Anything Else"").  Mr. Allen is back in true form with this off the wall British potboiler about wealth, privilege and how a man can become a monster.  Yes a monster, like Hannibal Lechter (spelling)? We see the devil is a gentleman; at least he starts out that way.  A man becomes evil when he A. Gives in to temptation even at risk to his and other peoples well being. B. When he continues this risky/dangerous behavior after he knows he should not, a habit can become an addiction and the monster cares not. C. He chooses to do great evil rather then face  his own demons, great evil being to do irreparable harm to people who have done nothing to him and do not, by any means, deserve there fate. The monster may even feel bad about it, but he is a monster first and he feels he was forced to do it.  This sounds weird but that's how I see Match Point.  The main character is a decent if flawed person who has incredible luck, he is more then lucky and turns his good fortune into better fortune, he sees temptation and gives in like a drug addict or problem gambler, he refuses to deal with his behavior even when he sees it will be his undoing, when all seems lost he has a choice and his choice is a monstrous one.  There is a macabre fascination with watching this film a second or third time, we can see the tragic tale unfolding, the scratchy opera soundtrack lets us know that tragedy is coming (and I don't know an opera from a pop tart). But this is not a tragedy like an earthquake or fire; this is the tragedy of an opera where people do great evil to each other.  The film is so predictable in the first and second act's that when it takes a hard left in the third act we are truly shocked and the ending (I will not give away the ending as it would ruin the film) is as cynical and monstrous as the events themselves.  This is a quiet, well-made shocker, which I can watch, over and over again and see new things.  With the sleazy slasher films making a comeback (Hostel, Wolf Creek etc) it is good to see that not all evildoers wear hockey masks or use chainsaws.",1148774400,2,2244,4.22196261682243

And I even loved the fact that there wasn't a single likeable person in the entire film.

But soon enough the movie took a turn for the worst. Beginning with the introduction of Scarlett Johannson's (sp?) character. I have only seen her in a couple of things, including Ghost World in which I thought she did a good job. But it was hard watching her in this role---reminded me of Sofia Coppola in the Godfather III. Just a wooden, uninteresting performance. And there was absolutely no chemistry whatsoever between her and the guy she was having an affair with. Considering that was basically the center of the movie, that made the overall film tough to believe on any level.

Oh, and another huge flaw (SPOILER ALERT). Remember when the character of Chris calls Nola at work to set up a meeting, at which time he plans to murder her. Nola then told her co-worker she was going to meet him. Don't you think the police would have talked to people at her work, who could have confirmed that Nola was going to meet Chris? I'm sure she mentioned something about her work in the diary, which lead the police to Chris in the first place.

My only other complaint is that the movie should have been about a half hour shorter, not that it would improve the 2 star rating at all, but it just dragged on and on.

I cannot recommend this film to Woody Allen fans who grew up on films like Annie Hall, Manhattan, or even Husbands And Wives. And especially if you have seen Crimes And Misdemeanors, this one will seem very unoriginal.",1147996800,8,1646,4.476666666666667

Was it really directed by Woody Allen?  I had to check the DVD cover to be sure.

I did like the idea of the ""matchpoint"", explained via narration in the begining of the film and the scene of the tennis ball striking the top of the net with the potential to fall on either side.  Woody Allen explored the concept of how fortune and luck played a bigger role in people's lives more than they claimed it did.  In the case of the main character Chris, fortune very quickly was falling out of favor with him.  Was he man enough to withstand the consequences or would he force fate his way?

2530160,3,B000EQHXNW,"After just recently being drawn in by Woody Allen classic like ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and ""Annie Hall,"" I went into Match Point expecting great things.  I may have overshot a little.  With great casting, solid performances, and interesting characters I was somehow unsure how I left the theater feeling somewhat cheated.

That is, until I realized that I didn't feel challenged by Allen to examine morality or human relationships as I have been in the past.  The ""surprise"" ending was unexpected, yes, but was lacking believability as well as purpose.

I do suggest seeing it for yourself, but I think you will feel the ""senselessness"" of the final scene.",1147910400,5,658,5.0
2530161,3,B000EQHXNW,"After all the hype about Woody Allen's ""comeback"" film, I was eager to see what the fuss was about. All those movie critics can't be wrong, right? Well, they were. Remove Woody's name from the credits, and all you have is an ordinary love triangle with a murder tacked on near the end.

If you know ""Crime and Punishment,"" ""An American Tragedy"" or Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" as well as the Scott Peterson case, you know what I mean. It's a tired old plot - social climber has affair with poor girl, gets her pregnant and decides to murder her in order to be with a wealthy woman.

Yawn. Still, Woody has made a film that's watchable. He was smart to film in Britain. Woody is so out of touch with real American life (few minorities; lots of fancy apartments with rich people) that the stuffy British upper class life suits him.

However, his constant, irritating use of scratchy old records for a soundtrack and his inability to write dialogue for REAL people in their 20s and 30s makes it clear that Woody is trapped in the past. The truth is, he's an old-fogey, and the people who love him can't admit he's behind the times. After all, his fans tend to be old too.",1147824000,6,1174,4.425925925925926

Consider: Pretty boy raises his personal status in life by marrying (or dating in PLACE) into a very wealthy family full of privilege; a life he won't give up at any cost.  On the side, he has a pregnant mistress (Shelly Winters in PLACE) who threatens to cause trouble and destroy the world he's become accustom to.  He decides to do away with the mistress and end his misery.  In MATCH POINT, though, our protaganist cleverly and luckily gets away with it.

On the part of luck, I have to give Allen credit for the old lady's wedding ring sequence; in that by bouncing backwards off of the railing, it serves to exonerate our ""hero"".  That was, indeed, a clever twist.

Before Allen dies (someday), I would love to see one more film with him and Diane Keaton.  The two shared an incredible chemistry that has never been duplicated.",1147737600,3,1109,4.5606060606060606

He meets Tom Hewitt, a wealthy young man whose common love of opera opens up a world of riches and high class mingling for the middle class Chris. Chris's luck starts to improve when Tom's sister Chloe falls in love with him, thus giving him opportunities for a lucrative career and a life of riches. When Chris meets Tom's fiance, Nola (played by the over-the-top sexy Scarlett Johanssen), he finds himself torn between his passion for the wealthy and proper Chloe and the pure lustful desire for Nola.

When I found out that this movie was directed by Woody Allen, I figured that it would be obnoxiously funny or quirky. Turns out that I was wrong as hell. For a movie pegged as a drama, it is unbearably suspenseful and thought provoking. This film unfolds like a play, with the actors engaging in long dialogue and exquisitely portraying their characters. However, what makes this drama different is how the well-developed characters play a part in the suspense that occurrs as a result of Chris's descent into madness as the stress of having an affair with Nola takes a tragic toll on him.

This movie was so excellent that I recommend it to everyone. I don't see how anyone would find fault in this film. It is pure brilliance from the tennis ball at the beginning to the ring at the end.

2530165,2,B000EQHXNW,"This is an odd experience for a British Woody Allen fan: it's set in London and most of the characters are British, but it's not a Britain I know.
Granted the characters are part of the landed gentry and a bit posh, but their speech patterns are all wrong. I watched it with a group of friends and we had a good laugh at the unrealistic dialogue that seems to come from Jane Austen's time. Actually it's quite offputting.
There are some big question marks about the basic premise: Chris, the lead guy, is supposed to be from Ireland, but has a cut-glass English accent. And he acts like he's never been to London before. Like he's from another planet.
The locations are all weird, perhaps partly because of the lack of 'on location' background noise. This is a very quiet London Allen's found. If only it was like that.
What all this does is give the movie a very inauthentic feel.
It's not helped by the the young lead, whose acting is wooden and unconvincing. It's possible he was floundering with the terrible script, but some of the other actors managed well enough. He though, more than anything else, makes the story hard to believe. You find yourself watching actors instead of getting involved in the story.
The bits of opera thrown in at melodramatic moments are rather ridiculous too.
But as mentioned, the script is perhaps the worst thing. It really does seem like some terrible Mills and Boon story at times, and you just can't avoid thinking about it, all through the movie.
Bravo, I guess, to WA for doing something a little bit different, though as one friend commented, it's really just 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' without the laughs.",1147564800,17,1649,4.6506849315068495

2530167,3,B000EQHXNW,"Some reviewers and movie-goers have been stunned by the transformation of Woody Allen as a director because of this film, and there's no doubt that this is a step in the right direction. His horrible, horrible, horrible film THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION completely turned me off (not to mention some of his less-than-appropriate personal behavior ...but that's another story). Woody had trouble seeing himself as an older guy in many of his more recent releases and seriously miscast himself in roles that were never intended for a short, balding, and aging man.

Thankfully, here in MATCH POINT, Woody's balding pate never makes an appearance. He's planted firmly behind the camera as director, and this is a very good thing (but not a great one).

I will give Woody Allen credit; he's gone off his previously overly beaten path and is branching out into realms unknown to him. Match Point is a case in point (no pun intended). Here we have a young tennis pro stud named Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who comes to London from Ireland in pursuit of a better life. He meets up with a nice, wealthy young man named Tom and is quickly introduced to his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). A relationship starts to build but not before Chris runs into Tom's fianc?, Nola (Scarlett Johansson), a blond bombshell who's ready to ignite anything near her. Chris marries Chloe but not before having ""an encounter"" with Nola, setting the stage for a relationship nightmare in the future. Tom breaks up with Nola, thus allowing Chris more access to her, but when pregnancies, family fortunes, and the future of everything Chris has been working for comes to a head, he has to make a choice; a terrible and wrong ...but lucky choice.

I don't want to give too much away here in case some of you decide to watch the flick. If you've seen it already, let me say that I don't agree with Chris' choice (obviously) but one can see why a man (or woman) could be driven to do such a horrendous thing.

I'm gauging this film based on other movies, not just other Woody Allen movies - thus my negative rating. Although this is a giant leap in the right direction for Mr. Allen, it still held a narcoleptic pace. The acting was okay, nothing extraordinary, but nothing to jump up and down about either. The sets ...eh. Nothing great there either. The dialogue was okay but sometimes felt forced and speedy. When Chris first meets Nola over a ping-pong table, their actions and emotions feel rushed.

Match Point has been compared, in theme, to Hitchcock. I beg to differ. Woody isn't that good, but perhaps with a little time he'll get there.",1147392000,3,2623,4.681127982646421

2530169,4,B000EQHXNW,"Viewers of MATCH POINT need to know that it is a very unique film for Woody Allen. It is the longest film that he has ever made. It's the first movie he has set entirely in England. And it's also one of his least personal movies. For longtime fans, this may be a welcome change-up, as they may have grown justifiably tired of Allen's recent subpar performances on his home court of Manhattan. (Oops, mixed sports metaphor there!)

There are two other things about MATCH POINT that are worth noting:

1. Hang in there. After 90 minutes, I was starting to lose my patience with the movie a bit. It is a beautiful-looking film, and the cast is excellent (including lead Scarlett Johansson who plays a part originally intended for Kate Winslet), but the story is neither comedy nor suspenseful drama. In fact , if one were to read the script of this portion of the film, it would come across as mildly interesting and utterly unremarkable.

2. At the 90 minute mark, the film turns into a thriller. Much of the material that has gone before (which seemed unimportant) now comes into play. I'm not going spoil any plot elements, but for me, the end vindicated the trials of the preliminary parts of the film's story.

SIDELIGHT: Because MATCH POINT turns into a serious genre exercise with seemingly no relation to Allen's previous oeuvre, I believe that if you stripped the film of its credits and showed it to an unsuspecting cinephile, they would be hard pressed to identify the famous director.",1147305600,2,1493,4.665399239543726
2530170,5,B000EQHXNW,"'Match Point', after much debate, is the film I would personally name as best of 2005.  The reason being is that it's refreshing.  It's smart and intoxicating, and while nothing really new it's original in it's own unoriginality.  In other words it feels better than the average film.  Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is an Irish tennis instructor whos moved to London and is just trying to make it when he meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) and through Tom he meets Chloe (Emily Mortimer), Tom's sister.  Chloe falls in love with Chris quickly, and Chloe's family does as well, falling for his charm and giving him a high position in the family business so he can support their daughter.  All seems well until Chris meets Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) and he's immediatly smitten with her beauty and apparent sexuality.  Some of his first words to her are ""has anyone ever told you you have very sensual lips?""  I'm sure they have.  Nola, confident in her affect on the opposite sex, plays with him almost, leading him on by a string as he desires her more and more.  The problem is that she is engaged to Tom, and through the course of time Chris becomes engaged to Chloe.  Eventually though thier desires for one another turn to lust and that lust manifest itself in an afair, an afair that continues past Chris's marriage to Chloe and Tom's split from Nola.  Chris is satisfied with his situation until Nola demands more, demands he leave his wife and marry her.  Now Chris is faced with a problem.  He's comfortable with his life, his easy life, and he doesn't want to destroy that.  He doesn't want to sacrifice his comfortable marriage and easy money for a lust driven relationship but Nola is getting desperate and is jeopordizing everything.  ""Be reasonable...""  Will he?  Brilliant script, acting, directing...everything is TOP-NOTCH especially the performances by both Johansson and Rhys Meyers who to me resembles and 20 something Joaquin Phoenix with Colin Ferralls accent.  I still can't believe that the acadamy has passed over Miss Johansson for the FOURTH time now!  You'd think she'd have won the thing by now.  Anyways, I recommend this film HIGHLY, and by the way, I just wanted to make clear that this film did not deserve the R rating for theres not one cuss word uttered in the entire film, no violence, and the sexuality is breif PG-13 status...I've seen MUCH worse of TV's Nip/Tuck...",1147305600,2,2405,4.788834951456311

I went into this thinking it would be a ""Closer"" like film--and though I do see the similarities in tone and feel--this film is different in it's own right. Has any reviewer ever read any tragic plays of Sophlocles? This reminds me of a Sophlocles play (indeed--the end has a magnificent quote from the man by the main character). The film does a good job at foreshadowing events to come by interspersing little hints throughout the film. Te ending is not a ""shock"" as everyone says but almost a logical conclusion in terms of classic tragedy. Many people will dislike this film, but I think that if one looks at it like one looks at an opera (which is a key aspect of the film) or tragic literature, then it will become a familiar yet unique experience. No film has ever been able to capture the tragedy of plays that i've seen--this comes very close.

  The only reason I have not given this film 5 stars is the fact that the film did not give me any sort of revelation. The films that are worth five stars are ones that you can take away from constantly throughout your entire life. I have a feeling that the reason I have not felt that it applies to my life all that much is that I am still young and have not truly felt the tragedy of love and reality. However,  the film certainly impacted me and I will be coming back to it to think about little subtleties.

Holding more grip than the bowl of Nascar space grits I had enjoyed that morning, Woody Allen kept me pensive and gooey eyed to swim beyond 'cliche, cliche, cliche - twist'.  The film is honest.  The characters do not endure extraordinary circumstance excepting only the superficial drapings of thier societal roles.  The lead faces critical consequence of a moral audience in that he portrays the villain to the masses by way of mad frenzy to feed the flesh and have all.

2530180,5,B000EQHXNW,"If I had to sum up the theme of this movie, I'd have to say it has to do with luck but the theme is far less important that its execution - and the result is a riveting movie, buoyed by the strong performances of every actor in this movie (Scarlett Johansson, Johnathan Rhys-Myers, Emily Mortimer,etc. Like so many Woody Allen movies, this one centers upon certain philosophical questions about life's meaning and the role that fate and destiny play. Is there an Ultimate Plan and how much comes down to luck and chance?

  The whole theme of luck is hinted at in the opening scenes of this film when a tennis ball is shown in flight, falling and then hitting the net, then frozen, neither falling on one side or the other, serving as a metaphor for luck. Which side will get the point and will that particular point determine the game?

  From that early scene, we are drawn into the life of Chris Wilton (Johnathan Rhys-Meyers), a former tennis pro who never made it to the very top and so is now working at a country club, teaching whoever comes his way. It is his good fortune to meet a young man who shares an interest in opera and who invites Chris to the opera.

  He doesn't know it but his life is already going down a certain path, one which will result in a web of intriguing complications. First he'll meet the young man's sister, Chloe, a woman who is smitten with him. THen he'll met the man's fiance, Nola, played quite well by Scarlett Johannsen, a woman who manages to be sexy, mysterious and flirtatious but also able to set limits as long as she is engaged.

  But when she is dumped by her fiance, Nola is open to having an affair with Chris. THe complication? He is by now married to Chloe and the marriage comes with an arranged job, a cushy new lifestyle and plenty of other quite appealing benefits, especially for a man without ""prospects"", someone used to working hard to get by. Suddenly everything has been handed to him.

  Nola is his Achilles heel, however, and she is also his passion. He lusts for her as he will never lust for his wife but Chris is not so smitten that he doesn't realize that Nola is a bit of a loose cannon. She is a  struggling actress who hasn't really gotten a major part, is impetuous and perhaps even emotionally unhinged. Perhaps that is even part of the attraction for Chris, a man who seems to manage to juggle both women, wife and mistress, quite adroitly...for a time.

  Then it all starts to unravel but not in the way you might expect. At this point, I think it is best to leave the rest up in the air because anything I add would be a MAJOR spoiler.

  I'll add just a couple of suggestions : no matter how caught up you get in the situation and what is happening in the movie, pay attention to the way luck and chance play out here. It is both amusing and horrifying and it makes for one very good film. It is the best Woody Allen film I've seen in years. Somehow it all comes together in this film and it all seems to work.

I was riveted by watching the chemistry between Chris and Nola and I wondered how far he'd go for his passions and how much he'd risk for her. I was a bit surprised by the events that transpired in this movie, although I can't say I didn't see hints of what was to come. Still, it wasn't entirely predictable. There were moments of true surprise.

  I think some of the success of this film comes down to the fact that the characters (with the exception of Nola, who has fled her home state of Colorado) are British and their restraint, their controlled emotions, make every violent act just that much more shocking, the way darkness sets off the light - or vice versa.",1146787200,3,3662,4.325036603221084
2530181,4,B000EQHXNW,"Like most Woody Allen films MATCH POINT is confessional and semi-autobiographical. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Chris, a retired British tennis pro, and the lovely and dynamic Scarlett Johanssen plays Nola, his American mistress in London.

Although the three-and-a-half star MATCH POINT is deplorably overlong, Allen handles the story well: Chris is married into the very wealthy, respectable, and reasonably normal oh-so-English Hewitt family. He and his wife Chloe are trying to have a baby, Chloe desperately so.

While Chris spends his days working for Chloe's father he falls passionately in love with Nola, a struggling actress who is everything his pleasant but conventional wife is not. Johanssen is the Golden Woman, a tempestuous, beautiful dream. Ultimately, of course, she wants exactly what Chloe has.

The rather lighthearted story begins to take on darker and darker hues as the tale unfolds. It is important to note that MATCH POINT never becomes INTERIORS.

Chris finds himself juggling two lives and is unable to commit fully to either one. His final choice is explosive and shocking, and leaves everyone's life ineradicably altered.

Johanssen is not just a pretty face. The twenty-one year old actress carries this demanding and mature role very well. While Allen spends most of his time on character development and, of course motivation, the rest of the characters are just backdrop.

A big difference between the two films, however, is that Crimes and Misdemeanors is almost equal parts comedy and drama, while Match Point is serious throughout.  Although Match Point is Allen's first commercially and critically successful serious film, I miss the comedic aspects of his work. But I suppose that if he decides to occasionally produce serious film work of this quality, I will more than gladly hold my breath from time to time.

But I can't help thinking that Crimes and Misdemeanors is the more accomplished film, in that it dares to mix serious subject matter (premeditated murder) with comedy. (But then, how many people have argued, quite effectively, that there is nothing more serious than comedy...?)

Some people have argued that Match Point is the less preachy and the more subtle of the two films, but they don't seem to take into account that comedy typically attacks its targets in a very direct way and can't help coming off a bit preachy so much of the time.  This is the nature of comedy.

From the wonderfully adept handling of the soundtrack and the unhurried, mostly natural pace of the editing to the carefully selected locations and restrained art direction -- including a Bergman-like confrontation with ghosts -- ""Match Point"" shows its purpose in every measure. There are few better combinations of art and comment capable of being so completely entertaining as well.",1146441600,3,1163,5.258064516129032
2530187,5,B000EQHXNW,"Before Match Point, I felt that Woody Allen was a boring pseudo-intellectual American with too much angst, low self-esteem, and envy for ""immortal"" concepts (such as God, Divine Providence, and immortality), who was made famous by other Americans like himself.

Granted, there are many points made by Allen over the years, which have aggrandized the legacy of East Coast Brahmins, in general, but, to me, he and they, have been just too, too, too boring.  Moreover, I just wished they could be more like the Europeans (e.g. the French), whom they seemed to ""imitate"" in a grudging ungracious manner.  Of course, it's moot to argue that American culture depends on old Latin and Anglo-Saxon culture for its very existence, but these days there are all kinds of people, from all kinds of places, who make bold statements with no basis in history, truth, experience, or reason.  I would expect them to not understand this review in any way.

However, in Match Point, Woody has grown past his adolescent neuroses and created a world-class film, about very universal concepts.  Luckily, most reviews seem to concur that this film deals deftly with social classes, gender, love, lust, fear, guilt, and punishment.  This movie takes Woody's former pre-occupation with neurosis and synthesizes all into a screenplay that combines all the quirky idiosyncrasies common to rich intellectuals and makes them very believable and full of pathos.  (That's if you believe that even this film is anecdotal, in a sense.)  Before, I never sympathized with any Allen characters, at all.  This time, I felt genuine emotion for just about everyone (smile).

What I loved most about this movie is summarized by the tennis game theory of match point.  When the ball hits the net, it stalls, and then falls backward from the net or forward over the net.  If it falls backward, the player loses, if it falls forward, the player wins.  Either way, the game ends.

When that ring hits the wall and falls backward, we just know that Chris has lost, not the material comforts he bargained for, but self-esteem, joy, and inner peace.  He will probably, forever, have to entertain Nola and her neighbor as his ""confidants"" for eternity (in bed, on the streets, at dinner, . . . ).

Such a tragic thought, but a form of justice.",1146355200,5,2295,4.888888888888889
2530188,3,B000EQHXNW,"I can't understand why some have awarded this movie five stars - it's simply not that good.  The movie falls into two distinct parts, joined together by the theme of the importance of luck.  The first half sets the scene well, though Allen's tenuous grasp on dramatic continuity is annoying (e.g. Chris and Nola make passionate love in a field in the pouring rain, end of scene, no mention of their reception when they go back indoors).  The second half (from Nola's discovery that she is pregnant) is truly dreadful - but credit to Scarlett Johansson for being irresistible in part one and the total opposite in part two.  I was glad when it was over.",1146355200,10,652,4.594827586206897
2530189,5,B000EQHXNW,"Matchpoint is a suspenseful story involving a love triangle and a Greek tragedy that opens up in the middle of the fifth set.  We are invited to watch this match, the minds and lives of the upper crust, as we meander around the grounds of London.  The actors are generally exceptional.  Beautiful Scarlett oozes sexual energy and tension though she plays the ""ugly American"".  The irony is heavy in this drama and the darker side of human nature pleasantly laid open to the grandstands.

Remember how we hated John McEnroe, hoped he would lose, yet still loved his game?  Well, the same principle is at work on us in this movie.

The most exciting part of a tennis match is the tiebreaker; and doubly so if the tiebreaker is in the final match of the tournament.  Woody manages to maintain that ""tiebreaker"" level of intensity throughout this film.  We won't stop watching until the final point is decided and the victor raises the trophy.

Side (minor) note:

The only weak spot in the film is the tennis!  Certainly tennis is often thought of as an elitist sport and as such made sense in this movie, but couldn't Woody have used a stunt man with a believable forehand?",1146268800,5,1171,4.603864734299517
2530190,5,B000EQHXNW,"In ""Match Point,"" Woody Allen serves up a quiet, yet powerful, morality tale.  Directed without flair and with little music, the story pulls us along by the strength of its intrigue.

When a tennis pro begins dating a woman with British class and money, he sees a life of ease and luxury ahead.  And yet, he is drawn to the wild and unpredictable side of an aspiring American actress who is also dating a wealthy Brit.  By turns slow and inexorable, the characters make choices that push them into ever-deepening trouble.  The final decisions will change their lives in unexpected ways.  Irony and justice play their hands alongside tragedy.

Told with great restraint, ""Match Point"" never glorifies the characters' poor decisions.  In fact, I see no reason for the R rating.  Through wonderful acting and sublime direction, this movie makes its point and lets us mull the consequences.",1146268800,57,886,4.9324324324324325
2530191,5,B000EQHXNW,"Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) once played on the professional men's tour and is now taking gainful employment as a tennis pro.  He illustrates the importance of luck by showing a tennis ball striking the tape at the top of the net.  The shot is played out in slow motion so we can see the point at which the ball is either going to sustain its spin and make it over the net to drop on the other side for a winning point, or it is going to drop down on the same side and cost who hit it a point (then again, it could be a serve and therefore either a bad first serve or a double fault if it is a second; but the assumption is that it is a regular shot and not a serve, so we will proceed on that basis).  We are given to believe that Chris' life is heading for such a moment, although we expect it to be rendered metaphorically and not quite so literally.

At the tennis club Chris works with Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), who is impressed enough by the former pro to invite him to the opera when he discovers it is something Chris enjoys.  The Hewett family has box seats, which seems a bit ostentatious for a place where ""La Traviata"" is being performed with only a piano accompaniment, but clearly the Hewetts have money.  When Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), discovers she likes Chris he is invited to the family home.  Her parents, Alec (Brian Cox) and Eleanor (Penelope Wilton), welcome him and since his daughter clearly wants Chris, Alec offers him a job in one of his companies.  After all, you have to be more than a tennis pro to live in this world.

Tom is dating Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), an American who has aspirations of being an actress but even less drive than Chris to attain such a professional goal.  There are sparks between Nola and Chris, but she is not going to marry a tennis pro and he makes the prudent choice to marry Chloe.  But after Chris marries, Tom breaks up with Nola, making her available.  More importantly, she is more interested this time around.  So while Chris is trying unsuccessfully to get Chloe pregnant, he has an affair with Nola and the irony continues as she is the one who becomes pregnant.  What does Tom do now?

Answering that question would give away the fun.  ""Match Point"" is one of those movies where it takes a while for you to discover what it is about, even with the help given by the opening shot and narration.  Suffice it to say that when you come up with the name of the director whose ballpark Allen is playing in this time around it is not going to be Ingmar Bergman who comes to mind.  In fact, if you skipped the opening credits of this film you would be hard pressed to ever think of Allen as being involved creatively.  The storyline is not familiar territory, his stock characters are not on display, and there is virtually nothing in the way of humor.  Only if you know it is Allen do you notice the improvisational dialogue and the tendency to position the camera and let things happen in front of it instead of panning or zooming.

Even if this is a Woody Allen film unlike previous Woody Allen films, it appears to be required to put ""Match Point"" in a frame of reference to those previous movies.  I would have to point to ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" for its fatalism, ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" because it turns out that what it is about is exactly what it tells us up front it is about, and ""Interiors"" since Allen neither appears as an actor in his film nor foists another in the Woody Allen role on us.  ""Stardust Memories"" also springs to mind because I end up thinking that it has been a long time since people from a planet, whether this one or some other, complained that they liked his earlier, funnier films.  ""Match Point"" certainly leaves things wide open as to what he will do next, especially now that he has once again caught our attention.",1146268800,2,3843,4.372714486638538
2530192,3,B000EQHXNW,"First off, a confession, Allen has never been one of my favorite directors.  He's usually derivative and self-absorbed and favors style over content, often to the extreme.  So when I heard ""Woody is back"" with Match Point I was intrigued but not exactly giddy with anticipation.

Sitting through the DVD of this -- a DVD without a single Extra Feature or Bonus, by the way -- I had to admit this is probably Woody's best film since Manhattan, but at 2 hours 4 minutes a better editor could have trimmed at least a half hour and prevented the nearly-fatal slump halfway in.

The characters are appealingly drawn. Scarlett Johansson is yummy in the Glenn Close role, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers makes a pretty good Jude Law, although the rise of his character Chris from tennis teacher to business magnate is underexplained.  The best member of the cast is Emily Mortimer as Chloe, the wife who doesn't deserve her heartbreak.  She's earnest and bewildered in just the right combination, and stands out as an actor in this cast.

Unfortunately the pacing lags, the camera-moves too often mimic Ingmar Bergman, the lighting is noticable (not a good thing) and the monochromatic interior sets are laughably overdone. While the film develops some sincere tension in the final minutes, it was a long hard slog getting there.

Hey, at least Woody didn't cast himself as the romantic lead.",1146268800,,1378,4.858974358974359
2530193,4,B000EQHXNW,"""People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck,"" says Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), retired tennis pro, now instructor to the county club set. One of his clients is Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), son of a wealthy businessman. The two men hit it off over their mutual love of opera, and soon Chris is socializing with the Hewett family. Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer) is quite taken with the handsome, young tennis instructor. And Chris, in turn, is taken with Tom's fiancee Nola (Scarlett Johanssen), a sexy, flirtatious American, somehow in London to advance her struggling acting career. Chloe's heart is set on marrying Chris -after she first finagles him a high-paying, upwardly mobile career in her father's business. For Chris, it's the chance of a lifetime. But there is always Nola, whose sensuality is difficult to resist. And Nola is trouble.

""Match Point"" recalls writer/director Woody Allen's earlier and greater film ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"", but with attractive young stars and a focus on the role luck plays in its characters' fates. It doesn't engage the audience the way Allen's best films do, perhaps because it's not as emotionally credible. And it runs a little too long. But the cast is talented and attractive. Chris and Nola are both ambitious souls who know how to exploit the guilt of rich people. And I might add that they both know how to pout to great effect. It's only a shame that Emily Mortimer is overshadowed by her co-stars. It is strange to see Mortimer playing a plain woman slighted for the younger, sexier Johanssen, when Mortimer is quite a bombshell herself. ""Match Point"" isn't a great film, but it's enjoyable. Not only for Woody Allen devotees and the art house crowd -the film isn't obscure or idiosyncratic in style or theme.

The DVD (Dreamworks 2006): There are no bonus features. Subtitles available in English, Spanish, and French. Dubbing available in French.",1146182400,3,1946,4.966257668711656
2530194,5,B000EQHXNW,"`Match Point', written and directed by Woody Allen, is like a long drink of cool water for devoted Woody Allen fans, as it is easily his best movie since `Crimes and Misdemeanors', to which it has many similarities.

As many earlier reviewers have said, the film breaks with many Allen traditions, as it is filmed entirely in London and environs and it has none of Allen's usual cast of actors. It also has virtually no jokes, and yet it is not as stiff and solemn as his first `serious' movie, `Interiors'. And yet, someone familiar with Allen's complete body of work will be able to see glimpses of his recurring themes lightly sprinkled here and there throughout the movie.

The most pervasive themes are guilt, lust, and luck. One may almost go so far as to say that this story is an homage to the great Russian novelist, Dosteyevsky and his novel, `Crime and Punishment', as the main character, Chris, is seen reading this novel at the beginning of the film, and Dosteyevsky is mentioned near the close of the movie. Lust and its consequences are themes in virtually every Allen movie, and he has attacked the subject from just about every angle. It is the main theme in all his best movies such as `Annie Hall', `Hannah and Her Sisters', `Crimes and Misdemeanors', `Manhattan', and `Husbands and Wives. Luck, written large in the form of the caprice of a cosmically indifferent physics and its inherent chance may not be a subject of many of Allen's movies, but it is often tied in with one of his favorite subjects, dispair and lack of faith.

Several of Allen's minor themes also pop up here and there, such as scenes taking place in and at the entrance to theaters and scenes taking place while there is action on the screen or stage in the background. In this case, it isn't `Casablanca' or some fictional `Purple Rose of Cairo', but some major live operatic scenes. Classic opera also forms the musical backdrop to all the action. And, except for the `Desdemona' aria from Verdi's `Othello', the appropriateness of the operatic backdrops escapes me, largely due to my paltry knowledge of the operatic canon. My only other observation about them is that Allen seems to have gone out of his way to pick scratchy recordings, probably from old vinyl records. I also have to believe that Allen has a special affinity to tennis, as the game and the tennis court appears at an important point in Allen's most important earlier movie, `Annie Hall'. In this movie, tennis is important mostly as an illustration of the capriciousness on chance and how, at the very end, a small twist of fate, not unlike the fall of a tennis ball poised above the net can make the difference between a loss and `match point'.

Unlike virtually every other Allen movie I have seen (and I have seen every one!), this story is played entirely straight from first scene to last. I think there are even more pieces of humor in the average `Law and Order' or `CSI' episode than there is in this film. This is important because it doesn't detract in any way from the real matter at hand, the attraction between the two primary characters played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Chris) and Scarlett Johansson (Nola), in spite of Rhys-Meyers' engagement and marriage to the Chloe, the character played by Emily Mortimer.

One thing you see in this movie which I have always respected in Allen's films is that the main characters are COMPETANT. We are generally not dealing with characticures of weak characters here. Even Allen's own nebbish character in many of his movies is generally a successful comedian, writer, or even detective (`Curse of the Jade Scorpion'). Poor son-in-law Chris is played as a genuinely talented up and comer, who fulfills his promise when given a convenient mid-level position in pappa-in-law's company. And, Chris' wealthy inlaws, played by Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton are played straight as an arrow, being totally devoted to the happiness of their daughter and her husband. The most important relationship between Chris and Nola is an expansion of the adulterous relation which dominates the `Crimes' half of `Crimes and Misdemeanors'. As this story takes center stage, it is much better developed here, and Johansson does at least as well as the older Angelica Houston does in `Crimes...'. The only problem, if any, is that Rhys-Meyers is just not quite as effective at playing out the guilt theme as the much older veteran actor, Martin Landau.

The only other problem I had with the acting and the story was that the Cloe character, as played by Emily Mortimer seemed simply too oblivious to her husband's lack of interest. She caught on too late and believed Chris' protestations of innocence all to readily.

The ending, I believe, depends on just a little suspension of disbelief. If one were to believe modern TV cop shows, the detectives are all bulldogs who rarely shrug off a lead. And, I suspect the fictional offspring of Inspector Lestrade are just a tad too willing to believe the story of a wealthy family scion, given a convincing, albeit thin circumstance leading the police to a different, totally unconnected perp. But, it all works, and works well. While it may not be as strong a performance (given the absence of a lead such as Bill Murray) as in `Lost in Translation', Johansson's performance is worth the price of admission and all other actors carry their roles very, very well.

And, London fills in for Allen at least as well as his favorite scenes from New York.",1146182400,4,5491,4.784810126582278
2530195,5,B000EQHXNW,"I admit I am one of the many who thought this man was past his prime. I still watch all his films in the theater, but with each passing year I seem to be more and more alone, and I can't say I blame the viewing public.

But no more. The movie is an bleak look at betrayal, illicit sex, hypocrisy, and crime. Perfectly cast and beautifully acted, this film's London location is one of its strongest assists. While the story isn't original - infidelity leading to betrayal - what makes this film special is Allen's masterful direction. The dialogue is crisp and the story is superbly plotted.

Scarlett Johansson gives what may be her best performance. I watch her and almost cannot believe how young she still is. Ferociously sexy yet subtly coy, she dominates every scene in which she appears.

Allen should consider shooting in London more often.",1146182400,6,847,4.633333333333334
2530196,5,B000EQHXNW,"Which side of the luck net are you on? Could you give up the taste of privilege for something as meaningless as love! This isn't what I'd call a happy ending movie. Why does one person's life go one way while another's goes so unfortunate?

It all comes down to who plays ball, if mother says your dreams are foolish you'd better hope you're lucky enough to prove her wrong. Hard work is a given but it all comes down to luck.

Of course the rich don't have to believe in luck, their money provides them with plenty of, all the luck they need. Money makes people doubt the possibility instead of just assuming the possibility.

If you want to see a sexy film see Allen's Match Point. Scarlett Johansson wows as a struggling actor, the whole cast gives a magnificent performance. Woody Allen gives an honest look at the way life can leave a bad taste in your mouth or an ache in your heart.

2530197,5,B000EQHXNW,"I've never liked Woody Allen. Even if I saw a movie by him that I liked, it was only a vague liking and had nothing to do with Allen. I liked ""Mighty Aphrodite"" but that was because of Mira Sorvino and ""Sweet and Lowdown"" was good, but had a lot of faults. I've never seen any of his ""good movies"" like Annie Hall as it turns out, so maybe he's better than I thought. Here is Woody Allen's first movie that is not set in New York and doesn't even mention New York; It's unlike any other Woody Allen movie but it still has the Woody Allen look and feel. The weird music and the way it's filmed, etc. The movie features a great cast (which is usually abundant in Allen's films) and it features Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Emily Mortimer, Scarlett Johansson, and Brian Cox. The movie takes a few minutes to achieve it's balance and once it does, it's pure entertainment. It's smart, it's got style, great acting, and a good script. The dialouge is also very good and I don't know if I'd consider the film ""noir"" as it's been called by a few people. But, anyway. Rhys Meyers, in a really good performance, plays Chris. Chris is a tennis pro who meets two very different woman through his friend Tom.

He meets Tom's sister Chloe (Mortimer) and Tom's fiancee Nola (Johansson). Chloe is sweet and loving and will bring Tom success and fortune. Nola is sensuous, gorgeous, and exciting. Well, Chris marries Chloe and Tom breaks up with Nola. After a chance meeting, Chris meets Nola again and the two begin an affair. I had read the reviews for this movie and had read about the twist at the end of the movie. After about an hour into this movie, I thought I had it pegged. Allen then turns the tables and a few unexpected things happen. Once again, you think you have it pegged when in the final moments Allen throws a curveball. I like how the very beginning of the movie sets up what's to happen at the end. The movie has some great scenes, the first scene in the bar with Chris and Nola is really good. The dialouge here is just spectacular. One viewer complained that the first scene in the bar was brilliant with sexual innuendo's flying everywhere, but when you reach the next bar scene it's reduced to ""Can I buy you a drink?"" This isn't a lack of creativity on Allen's part, it's meant to show how the relationship between Nola and Chris has changed. The scene with the ring is well filmed and I love the ending, although it's not ""one of the best endings in recent years"" or anything. I also want to bring up Johansson's performance. She's a great actress, but takes a lot of roles where she doesn't really get to show us how good she is (The Island for example). So this is a nice change of pace for her. Also, just as a side note for Johansson fans, there is no nudity in this film whatsoever. It comes close once or twice, but that's it. But, anyway, this is probably one of Allen's best films and it's certainly a triumph after a series of movies which have tanked both commerically and critically.

This movie is one to talk about afterward and definately not cliche. The only negative thing about this movie is the lack of extras, or really no DVD extras.

2530201,5,B000EQHXNW,"Woody Allen is always at his finest when he stays away from self-parody: the man can write and direct brilliantly and create solid gems of cultural/society examinations with the best of them!  MATCH POINT is a case in point. From the opening credits, to the keenly meaningful voice-over about the significance of luck in molding the course of our lives, to the arresting pause of a tennis ball frozen in its rise from a struck net before falling to either side, to the use of scratchy Enrico Caruso recordings  - all of these are indications that Allen is about to lead us into a world defined by walking on razor blade edges.  Match Point is an intelligent, burnished, glowing little masterpiece of movie making, a thriller that keeps the viewer bound until the surprise ending.

Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers, groomed and handsome and magnetic in his first role as a non-quirky oddball) is a lower middle class ex tennis pro who begins his new life as a tennis teacher in a wealthy club where he encounters the Hewett family, a family of immense wealth lead by a benevolent father (Brian Cox), a class conscious mother (Penelope Wilton), a handsome son Tom (Matthew Goode) who is dating a middle class American wannabe actress Nola (Scarlett Johansson), and daughter Chloe (Emily Mortimer).  Chris' good looks and manners win the family's affection and he is melded into the fabric of wealth through his attention to Chloe and his movement into the father's business. Sadly for all Chris is attracted to the sensuous Nola who, despite her physical attraction for Chris, knows the steps to climb up the ladder to wealth by being engaged to Tom.

Chris falls in love with his new life of luxury, marries Chloe who wants to have children immediately, and yet he lusts for Nola.  In time Nola and Tom part (the reason to be outlined later in the film) and though hesitant to shake Chris' marriage to Chloe, Nola becomes physically involved with Chris.  The inherent dangers of Chris' infidelity grow to tragic proportions and his knotty dilemma of choosing his new life of comfort versus his lust for Nola result in bits and pieces of luck that determine the outcome of the film.

For this viewer it is difficult to fault any aspect of this film: the cinematography by Remi Adefarasin is not only stunning visually - it also captures the tension of the film in mixing tight shots with panoramas isolating the characters in motion of betrayal;  the film's music score is almost entirely opera excerpts from old Caruso recordings (know the opera excerpts and the story is enhanced!) and from 'live' stage performances at Covent Garden (superb singing and staging oddly accompanied by only a piano!).  But the brilliance of this ensemble is Allen's keenly sensitive eye and timing and pacing of a suspense thriller that always has as its base a fine dollop of social comment and lusty romance.  The cast is impeccable, from the consistently superb smaller roles to the tour de force acting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, and Emily Mortimer.  This is clearly one of the finest works of Woody Allen's long career and hopefully he will continue along this vein.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, April 06",1146009600,8,3208,4.839122486288848

2530203,5,B000EQHXNW,"Woody Allen heads for London in his powerful, disturbing, and brilliantly acted MATCH POINT, which was an Oscar nominee for Original Screenplay.  We have an ensemble cast of six, billed alphabetically as always with Allen:  Brian Cox, Matthew Goode, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, and Penelope Wilton.  Woody does not appear in it or even narrate voice-over.

Rhys-Meyers is the anti-hero, Chris, a former tennis pro and now an instructor.  He is a working class cad who sleeps around with his brother-in-law's sluttish American fiancee Nola (Johansson) even after marrying into wealth with the beautiful and elegant British Chloe (Mortimer).  What we have here is a skillful blend of equal parts Dreiser's AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY, Dostoevsky's CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, and original Woody Allen.  Amid a backdrop of strikingly original and fresh London locales, Chris keeps having sexual encounters with Chloe (whose smoking in the film's first half is a major irritation for me), while his loving wife suspects nothing.  Why anyone married to this likeable and loving Chloe would want to have an affair with the coarse and unpleasant Nola is part of MATCH POINT's ironic complexity.  Seemingly, Allen does not want the affairs to make sense.

When Nola gets pregnant, refuses an abortion after two failed marriages, and demands that Chris leave his wife, the film's second half really kicks into gear.  Woody ventures into the darkest and most chilling material he has ever created.  MATCH POINT becomes ironic and enthralling.  This is Woody Allen's longest film at 124 minutes, but one of his very finest.  It is flawless and dead serious adult filmmaking.  One wishes he would stay abroad for a while and make more films that do not feature him in them!

The only fault is not a film flaw at all, but rather the lack of bonuses on a DVD retailing for a steep $30 (I paid $20 at Target; Amazon has it for even less).  But from what I have read about Woody Allen and what he thinks about his movies and which are the best and worst, he is his own executioner.  We are probably better off interpreting this film and other Allen ones as we choose.  Still, I would like the filmmaker to let me know if I am on the right track in hating Nola and embracing Chloe in this movie.  Critics I've read can't even agree that Chris and Chloe are married to one another!  Then why would Nola ask Chris to divorce Chloe when Nola gets pregnant?  It all makes for great coffee house or bedroom conversation after seeing this magnificent movie in a theater or on home video.",1145923200,3,2580,4.8159090909090905
2530204,5,B000EQHXNW,"""Match Point"" is brilliant! Woody Allen's directing and screenplay (Oscar-nominated screenplay and has won 3 oscars, thus far) are awesome. One of the finest films in recent history. Jonathan Rhys Meyers' & Scarlett Johansson's performances are excellent. The opera music that is used in the background is excellent. The cinematography by Remi Adefarasin (he, ironic did the cinematography to ""In Good Company"" (2004) which also stars Johansson & nominated for an Oscar for her work on ""Elizabeth"" (1998) is excellent. The film editing by Alisa Lepselter (who has film edited Allen's films for the last 7 years) is excellent. The casting by Patricia Kerrigan DiCerto (who has worked on Allen's films for the last 11 years), Gail Stevens & Juliet Taylor (who has worked on Allen's films for the last 31 years) is excellent. The production design by Jim Clay is excellent. The set decoration by Caroline Smith is excellent. The costume design by Jill Taylor is excellent. This is an intriguing murder mystery that keeps you thinking.",1145923200,,1031,5.142857142857143

Also, if she really was pregnant, the cops could have proved the affair so not sure if she really was.

I really enjoyed this film and the acting was really well done.

2530206,5,B000EQHXNW,"Match Point is a great film. It is a step above and beyond most films released these days.

The film, at it's heart, is about the meaning of life. Is there a God? Is there justice? Match Point takes the stance that unpredictable luck is one of the biggest factors in life. The tennis ball analogy at the beginning of the film lays this philosphy out perfectly. In tennis, there's a point in the match where the ball hits the top of the net. If it goes forward, you win the point. If the ball comes back at you, the point is lost.

But be careful. The opening is the key to the film. Tennis is a game created by someone. Therefore the game has a clear set of rules. It has a design. But does life itself have a design? When your match point arrives, does it really matter which side of the net your ball lands on? Is justice served, or do we live in a world with no design or meaning, without a God?",1145750400,,898,4.067796610169491
2530207,4,B000EQHXNW,"Most thrillers, such as Basic Instinct, Maltese Falcon, Bullitt, or North by Northwest...can be enjoyed over and over because of their overpowering sense of style. Perhaps the greatest sin of the ""average"" thriller is, despite the redemption it offers in the end, it can make murder appear ""glamorous"" or at least clothe the crimes in a stylish cinematic technique.

Match Point's fundamentally different approach denies us the stylish pleasures and light humor of the typical thriller while also denying redemption and justice. Which for many, will truly bring a sense of disgust.

Match Point is not stylish or cool. There are no comfortable barriers here. It is a movie you can watch only once, but the awful story may stay with you forever.

Time and again we had to keep telling ourselves ""This is just a movie."" The tension and procrastination of the situation Chris gets himself into is just unbelievable; I was practically clawing my eyes out. This guy is nuts!

In the end, Chris does what is expedient, and damn what may go on inside him. Perhaps Allen will make a ""Match Point 2"" in which Chris is shown raising his children and still shielding his guilt. ;-)

The focus for everyone is on Chris' impossibly contradicted state of mind. I thought he was going to have a nervous breakdown and kill himself. How can he live with his wife Chloe and her family and not inadvertently reveal his inner turmoil? I don't buy it. Or if I do buy it, that cannot possibly be the end of the story.

The ending is unsatisfying by the measure of conventional drama for at least three reasons:
1. There is no redemption.
2. There is no release.
3. There is no resolution.

The viewer is denied the satisfaction of resolution and the relief of justice served. There is no denouement. Except perhaps for the ""relief"" that occurs after the actual murders. Unlike your typical thriller, I really felt that what happened was appalling, beyond the cinematic sense of ""appalling"". The penetrating depth and truthfulness was unlike any other ""thriller"", if one can even call this film a thriller. It's unpleasant to watch.

So Woody Allen has made a REALLY original movie here, which takes some rather unique turns within the suspense genre that I really haven't seen before. It is indeed Hitchcock, minus the lighthearted Hitchcock humor. There isn't a grain of humor in this movie! Nothing to break the tension, which is why I was still shaking for ten minutes after seeing it. Even the score, which consists solely of scratchy opera recordings, provides no relief.

The brutal and naked immorality of the crime Match Point depicts is itself as strong and astringent a moral statement as I think I have ever seen in a film. Chris commits a crime against everyone, even himself.

I don't think this is the kind of story people go to movies for. It is the kind of story people go to church for. It is not ""entertainment"". It can only make you glad you're living your own life and not Chris'. The only thing left is GUILT. Not external guilt, not the kind associated with a gavel pounding on a bench or with handcuffs and prison bars. This is a wrenching story of internal guilt.

For the opposite type of story, see a thriller from the Watergate era (circa 1972), such as ""The Getaway"" or ""The Hot Rock.""",1145750400,3,3291,4.706086956521739
2530208,5,B000EQHXNW,"Just when you think you have pegged Woody Allen to a certain type of film, he surprises everyone with a film like this.  Working at a video story, I found some of the conversations that I heard right around Match Point's theatrical release interesting.  They would go something like: ""Oh, I really want to see the new Woody Allen movie, Match Point.""  ""Oh really, what's it about?""  ""Tennis, or something.""  I don't think anything could have prepared these people for the show they were about to get.  The beginning of the film finds Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) taking up a job teaching tennis (this is really the only tennis in the film).  Chris is ambitious, greatly wanting to ""make something"" of his life, as he puts it.  Before long, he meets Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), and Tom's sexy fiance Nola Rice (played wonderfully by Scarlett Johansson).  Immediately, Chris is extremely attracted to Nola, and their tension is immediately felt.  The disappointing part about this is that we are thrown into a sense of passion, only to be left hanging when Chris and Nola's relationship takes a dive down to a more basic level.  In their first encounter, they are flirting like mad, with sexual inuendo's flying every which way, and the viewer is intrigued.  But in their next encounters, their relationship is reduced to ""Hey, how are you? Care for a drink?"" and in which we find out everything there is to know about Nola and her past.  This is the only problem with the film.  Couldn't we leave Nola as a mystery, like Glenn Close's character in Fatal Attraction?  Now, Johansson's character isn't nearly as bad as Alex, but more on this later.  Chris and Nola have a heated encounter later, but nothing becomes of it.  Nola and Tom break up, and Nola vanishes from our lives, during which Chris marries Chloe.  Almost immediately, we see a change in Chris.  He quits his job to work for Chloe's father Alec (Brian Cox) at a big mega-corporation.  Immediately, Chris' character begins to change, and we can see he is bored; bored with Chloe and her desperation to become pregnant, bored with the nine to five office job, and bored with the stuff he didn't want.  Then, Nola reenters the picture, and her flame with Chris ignites again.  She becomes a bit obsessive, begging Chris to leave Chloe, and calling him at all hours of the day.  This is the part where Allen starts toying with us.  Do we side with Chris?  He's obviously doing Chloe wrong.  Or do we side with Nola?  Yes, she's a bit obsessive, but can we blame her?  Chris feeds her with empty promise after empty promise, with absolutely no outcome.  When Nola becomes pregnant, the real suspense begins.  What is Chris to do?

Woody Allen crafts an ending that is the perfect example of how to use a ""twist ending"" that is so often misused by filmmakers and writers.  The film is so well written, so well put together, and so well acted.  Meyers is the perfect person for this role, and he almost reminds me of a cleaner, well-dressed, Irish Joaquin Phoenix.  Allen's writing has been a little off lately, but Match Point puts him back on track.  Hopefully he can follow this one up with something equally as good, if not better.  Match Point is emotionally, physically, and psychologically tense from beginning to end, always one step ahead of the viewer.  Match Point is one of 2005's best films, and a triumph for Woody Allen.",1145664000,4,3434,4.682274247491639
2530209,2,B000EQHXNW,"I find it sad that audiences and critics feel compelled to blow so much sunshine up Woody Allen's you-know-what just because he finally made another even watchable film. The utter mediocrity of his last dozen or so movies is no reason to trumpet the release of Match Point, a film that is at best bearable and probably most accurately described as, well... pointless.

Even a return to more fundamental narrative style doesn't prevent huge doses of classic Woody Allen ""classturbation,"" in which lavish settings and the details of an exhorbitant lifetsyle become characters as important as any of the ones embodied by the actors. Bryan Cox's character seems to be drowning in his own affluence in just about every scene; it is downright painful how many times he mutters the same line, ""You know you two will never have to worry about money"" to his daughter and son-in-law. Cox's performance seeks to reinforce Allen's cinematic creedo, which his own personal roles usually spend countless scenes belaboring: no amount of personal or financial success can ease the basic human restlessness and discomfort within all of us.

Match Point, however, disembarks from the usual Allen blueprint of disjointed, exhaustively expositional dialogue-driven scenes in favor of a more plot-driven narrative. But with such a simplistic plot, bereft of complexity and subtext, this isn't even necessarily a positive departure for the filmmaker. The slow buildup of tension within the second act is the closest this story gets to engaging its audience, before a twist at the second act climax that sends the tale spinning off beyond unbelievability into downright absurdity. Any value that Allen derives from his little third act twist-within-a-twist (involving use of a metaphorical ""net ball"" in tennis) is promptly squashed by more heavy-handed expositional dialogue between his too-dim-to-believe police investigators. It is as if Allen himself grew too excited by his newly rediscovered skill with more conventional narrative, and lost sight of how subtlty fits into that equation.

If anything, the commercial and critical success of Match Point will hopefully encourage Woody Allen to pursue a disciplined approach to his storytelling in the future. But that is not a good enough reason to sing the praises of such a lackluster effort as this.",1145491200,16,2333,5.266129032258065
2530210,5,B000EQHXNW,"It is not a match what Mr Allen has won. It's a whole Grand Slam tournament. He has put all his balls unreachable to any enemy.

Allen normally makes you think about life and makes you give a sunrise out. Allen was not used to make a film like this. I can see some traces of the best Hitchcock in this movie. Also, it is fantastic to see how he has cared about landscapes in the town and at the village.

The treatment of the actors is what you can expect from Allen. Scarlett and Jonathan are incredible. The supporting actors give an atmosphere of mystery and crudelity that surrounds the loving couple.

Yes, you need to see the credits to believe this is a film by Woody Allen. Personally, I like his films, but this is what makes him a great director. Saving distances is like when Spielberg is capable of making ""Jaws"" and ""Jurassic Park"" and, in the other hand, he can make ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Color Purple"".

Allen, so, has been able to do ""Bananas"", ""Annie Hall"" and now ""Match Point"". You win.",1145232000,6,1011,4.390374331550802
