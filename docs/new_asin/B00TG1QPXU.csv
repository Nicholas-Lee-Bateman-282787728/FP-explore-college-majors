7007066,5,B00TG1QPXU,"Six votes? Thats it? C'mon people, I haven't even watched it yet and given that he's one of only a dozen or so celebrities in this country towing the ""Wake up to reality"" line, GIVE THE VOTE! Heres a 5 Star Bill. You better not disappoint me...oh, an to those good ol' boy that as he's repetitive or reusing material you should know that Bill writes all his own material. Thats right- from Real Time to the stand up, working 365 days a year, it's all drippings from Bills created mind-grapes. Yucking Fea.",1447545600,,505,4.440860215053763

7007079,1,B00TG1QPXU,"I see why Bill can be controversial, and I do put that into perspective.  I do like many of Bill's real beliefs, not because he just speaks for the sake of speaking or to be glib, but what he says does have a lot of logic - even if nobody sees it.  You don't need to see logic to know it's there, rather to imagine the logic and to go from there.  Good stuff Bill, I like your style, I've got to say.",1464134400,,400,3.7951807228915664

8701592,3,B00TG1QPXU,Compared to Bill's weekly monologues on Real Time this dvd is a real disappointment. Far too much yelling out from audience members is very annoying. especially when added to the so so comedy. I'm really sorry I bought this one. I've always been a big of fan of Bill Maher.,1500336000,,273,4.48

8701595,3,B00TG1QPXU,"I am not a big fan of BM, but this is worthy to watch to kill an hour if only to learn of his relationship or comments on Trump. This is filmed before even the nomination of Trump, so his observations are strangely prescient.",1484438400,,225,4.136363636363637
