8536809,5,B0096PBCXO,"What a thrilling adventure, just like being a kid and go to the matinees again. River pirates, action, romance, colorful 19th Century outfits and all. The print is not totally crisp all the time but it really is all right. Lex Barker is a great actor. His Tarzan films were good but I always thought they should have made him into a more sophisticated Lord Greystoke/ Tarzan instead of the old grunting stuff. In Duel on the Mississippi he shows qualified acting. Patricia Medina is a dashing heroine and Ian Keith, John Dehner and all the rest are likewise fine. Sit back, forget about problems og everyday life and enjoy!",1438387200,,623,4.672727272727273
