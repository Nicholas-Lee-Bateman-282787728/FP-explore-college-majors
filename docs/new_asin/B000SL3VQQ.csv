8205807,5,B000SL3VQQ,"While it's not fancy or flashy, this dvd provides clear instruction on techniques and more importantly on the principles that make the techniques work. Great for new rookies or for veterans who need a refresher.",1347926400,,211,5.057142857142857
8205808,3,B000SL3VQQ,It is a good demonstration of techniques that you can use. it would have probably received a five star if the photography was professionally done.,1230508800,2,146,4.88
8205809,4,B000SL3VQQ,"This film is targeted towards law enforcement officers and it features a limited number of control and takedown techniques applicable to real life situations. There are only handful of techniques with some variations on the film. This is a good thing, as you really don't need that many techniques, and that way there is sufficient time devoted to instruction of each technique.

The instruction of techniques is very detailed, in fact at the beginning the film seemed to advance even bit too slow for my taste, but then the viewers who are not familiar with the techniques have a better chance of catching the techniques on the first run.

The only downside on the film is production. The film is otherwise OK, but there does not seem to be no-one to operate the camera, as the camera does not move when the subjects on the screen move to the edge of the picture. On many occasions, half of the screen is empty and all of the action happens on the edge of the screen and the subject are only partially visible on the screen. At least on one occasion the instructor is speaking directly to the camera, but the top of his head is cut off from the picture! Luckily, that does not prevent the viewer from seeing the action properly.

To sum it up, I would recommend this film to anyone involved in law enforcement, corrections of similar profession. If the actual filming would have been done better, this would have been a 5-star film.
