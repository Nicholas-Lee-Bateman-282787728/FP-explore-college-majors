8054501,2,B0007Z9QVC,"Nemec provided me with some of cinema's most sublime 60s cinema, and this in a very fertile period of European product. 'Diamonds of the Night' remains a cherished experience. But then came the Fall and, as we discover in this film, Nemec, when confronted by the Russians with the prospect of internment or enforced exile, opted for the latter, and settled in America. It was a decision that unhinged Nemec, certainly on the evidence submitted on this film. Nemec's courage to tell all in this rambling reconstruction is to be applauded. But only the most devout follower of his work would claim it as much more than this.",1134259200,3,622,4.768518518518518
