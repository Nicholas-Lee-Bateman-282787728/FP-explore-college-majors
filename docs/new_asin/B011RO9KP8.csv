8724981,4,B011RO9KP8,"Looks like a really good mystery. I love those old British mysteries from the 30s & 40s. But ""spoiler alert""!! Do not read the back of the DVD case in the picture on this listing unless you want to know what is probably most if not all of the mystery involved. Very bad decision by someone to put what is probably the ending(unless that's just the beginning, in which case I'd be very impressed with a mystery from that era having more than one or two twists to the story, though there are a few, but I'm guessing the story's not that elaborate) in the synopsis on the back cover!! So beware! Still, the film looks like great fun, if it's a decent copy. No way to really tell though. Might be a third or fourth generation copy off of a vhs, as was another DVD in the series, as one reviewer wrote. Another reviewer said as much, and it sounded pretty much unwatchable. I wish someone who's seen this copy would comment on it. Might save people a lot of money. So again beware. For a cheap price, I might take a chance. Really like Alistair Sims, Sidney Gilliat had a hand in the writing, and it just looks like a lot of fun!",1465516800,10,1124,4.232558139534884
