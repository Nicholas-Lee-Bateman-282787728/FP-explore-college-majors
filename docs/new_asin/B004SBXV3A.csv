8439636,2,B004SBXV3A,"It has a few (very few!), brief (very brief!) cinema moments that evoke GODFATHER 1, but these are fleeting and don't typify the film as a whole.  Whenever the film needs to be moved along, good old violence/murder/robbery/shoot-em-in-the-head gets the script writers out of a jam and affords them a fresh mini-start.  The abrupt cutting also leads to confusion as to what actors fit in where, and whose side they're on.  The plot is basically simple, and the constant string of violent events diverts our attention from the slim premise that's stretched out for over two hours.  As a change of pace from the violence, we watch other cliches of gangster films: retreads of boring nude sex scenes & domestic tensions that haven't changed since Steve McQueen in BULLIT and Pacino in HEAT; these are phased in and out in a calculating way.  The high point of the film is the-center-of-Paris, casket tribute to a murdered policeman where the photography team hits its zenith and, in fact, they are extraordinarily adroit throughout the film and keep scenes fresh and inventive.  This is desperately needed,  because the substance of the story is kept shallow.  The final scene, too, relies on violence-out-of-nowhere as a quick way to close the film.  Over reliance on formulas and ""hook the audience"" gambits leave one with the empty feeling this is an elaborate shell game, rescued by very competent cinematography.",1365033600,,1413,5.004273504273504
8439637,3,B004SBXV3A,"Former cop Olivier Marchal's classy French policier has in its favour it has two great performers on top form in Daniel Auteuil and, especially, Gerard Depardieu (who gives surprising depth to what appears to be a seriously underwritten part consisting mainly of troubled glances) and the neatest set of moral bear traps to face a movie cop since the original Insomnia as the two veterans compete for a promotion held out as the prize for bringing in a dangerous gang of armed robbers with disastrous consequences. Yet while the performances are strong and the script better than average for the genre, the musical score is a major problem that unfortunately works so strongly against the film that it ends up drowning many of its good points. It's not that the main theme is bad, but does it HAVE to be used without variation in almost every single scene in the last two thirds of the picture? Sadly, this is by no means an exaggeration, and the repetition does the film no favours.

A US remake with a no-doubt sleepwalking Robert De Niro has long been in the offing, but while you're waiting, Tartan's BluRay boasts a decent 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, with the extras carried over from their UK release - 9-minute interview with the director, making of documentary, wardrobe and gunsd featurettes and trailers - with Marchal's audio commentary, the 69-minute documentary and other extras from the more comprehensive French release still missing.",1351555200,3,1449,4.962962962962963
8439638,4,B004SBXV3A,"Also known as ""36 Quai des Orfvres,"" ""Department 36,"" or just plain ""36,"" this is a French film from 2004 starring the great Daniel Auteuil and Grard Depardieu. The film shows a much darker side of Paris than most people are used to seeing. Criminals are very violent and do not fear the police, while the police themselves are morally questionable.

Daniel Auteuil plays Leo Vrinks, who leads his own ""Strike Team."" They brutalize criminals and do not follow police procedure, yet Vrinks does have a good heart and believes he is in the right. Depardieu who plays Denis Klein on the otherhand, is an opportunistic and cold hearted scoundrel who will do anything to get ahead no matter how horrible it is.

The two put in very good performances, and they are not seen as ""movie cops,"" but real people with emotions and depth. One might even compare their rivalry to Pacino and DeNiro's in ""Heat."" Auteuil and Depardieu play off of each other very well during their heated confrontation that slowly boils.

While this is not an action film, there is good action to be found which shows the brutality of the bank robbers and how efficient the police are.

The film is based on writer and director Olivier Marchal's experiences as a cop, and it's amazing to know how many of the events really happened.

""36"" is a very good movie that combines police procedural, thriller, and morality tale into one.",1307923200,15,1397,4.709016393442623
