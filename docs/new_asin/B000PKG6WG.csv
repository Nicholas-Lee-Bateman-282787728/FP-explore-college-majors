8192177,2,B000PKG6WG,"I bought this based on the previous two Ian Roussel videos that I purchased...which were great.  In the extras on this DVD, there is a short piece from him, which I enjoyed.  The rest, however, is terrible.  I found it very difficult to watch, or even listen to, due to the poor camera work and fairly annoying music.  Minimal clear pictures of cars...lots of pin-up girls.  Not something that I will ever watch again.  Not worth the purchase price.  Save your money.",1452729600,,467,4.621951219512195

8192180,4,B000PKG6WG,It was real interesting to see how the car Kulture started and evolved over the years I loved it .,1383091200,2,98,3.95
8192181,1,B000PKG6WG,"Other than the  Ian Rousell part about redoing a shoebox Ford, this video was a complete waste of time and effort
I thought I was going to get motion sickness from the camera moving around so fast, and because of the fast movement you couldn't really get a very good look at the cars ,or the women ! wasted my money on this one !",1352160000,,329,4.061538461538461

8192183,4,B000PKG6WG,"This is a great way to spend an hour, plus a couple of interesting bits in the bonus material for another 15-20 minutes. Better than Back from the Dead 2, just behind Back from the Dead 1 in terms of entertainment value. For the price, you won't be sorry. There are currently two 1-star reviews for this DVD, one because a guy bought a scratched copy and the other because he doesn't like rat rods and this DVD has some. Neither of those reviews should even be listed here, they're pointless and don't speak to the film itself. Ignore them. If you like hot rods, rat rods, kustom cars, and great music, you're gonna love this disc.",1334102400,8,631,4.401709401709402
8192184,1,B000PKG6WG,"Save your money. This DVD is a waste of money. It has a bunch of beat up ""Rat Rods"" and really doesn't focus on cars. Rent it if you really want to see it,it's terrible!",1325894400,,169,3.857142857142857
