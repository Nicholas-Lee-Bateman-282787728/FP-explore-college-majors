5178636,5,B008QOH1NG,"Hair metal, the once heralded king of the late 1980s and the butt of many jokes in the post-Nevermind 1990s, has some of the most rabid fans in the world. Over the past couple of decades, bands that once reigned the rock radio airwaves have been making a comeback, fighting the stereotypes and releasing new music. Religious rockers Stryper, however, may have been one of the last groups people expected to reunite. Singer Michael Sweet enjoyed some success as a solo artist and other band members found other projects, but a few years ago Stryper, whose name is a reference to Isaiah 53:5, decided to take the stage together once again.

With Live in Indonesia at the Java Rockin' Land, fans have the opportunity to relive the glory days of the yellow-and-black attack (sans the spandex). Brothers Michael and Robert Sweet, Oz Fox, and Timothy Gaines blast through 69 minutes of classic Stryper material, from the big hit ""Honestly"" to the fan favorites ""The Rock That Makes Me Roll"" and ""Soldiers Under Command."" The concert is what you would expect from a band that is three decades old; the songs still pack the same punch, even if the singer isn't able to quite reach the notes after all these years. That's not to say he sings poorly; on the contrary, Michael's voice sounds good, just not perfect...but what's the point of a live recording if it sounds just like the studio release?",1354233600,6,1389,4.739669421487603

5178689,4,B008QOH1NG,As a kid I grew up on Stryper from the yellow and black attack to when they even went to the blue and black to crossover to main stream. When I saw this video on Amazon I was really curious to see how they sounded after not hearing them for many many years. I was first amazed how large the crowd was and they stage show which you immediately see from the opening song. Wow !!!! They sound amazing even better than when I use to rock out to them many many years ago. They put on an amazing show in this video so good that I looked up their recent cd and even purchased a few. This is a great concert with great sound and video quality. If you were ever a Stryper fan at anytime you gotta see this video it will knock you socks off !!!!!

I was completely floored.  Excellent videography, clean sound production.  Yeah, they had to go to Indonesia to actually fill a stadium, but honestly, I was blown away.  I wish they had skipped the hair, makeup and spandex back in the day, because I might have actually been a fan.  The music is definitely still 80's highly produced metal, you know, the kind with the raw edges smoothed over, and the concert was about the music, not the gimmickry, and the music stands on it's own.  Searing tenor harmonies, precision dueling guitar riffs, tight, solid drumming.  Oh, and lyrically safe given the Christian subject matter in the songs.",1463961600,2,807,4.714285714285714

Michael Sweet's voice is still amazing, Robert Sweet still kicks (you-know-what) on the drums, Tim Gaines still has the pounding bass lines and both Oz Fox & Michael deliver some of the BEST dual guitar work in the business.

5178726,5,B008QOH1NG,"Stryper-Live in Indonesia-This video is so good, I thoroughly enjoy popping this DVD into my DVD player every chance I get. The video quality is excellent. A handful of times the camera gets washed out by a spot light, and a handful of times a camera is out of focus for a second, but is corrected immediately. Ill get to the sound quality in a minute, but let me just say that the sound quality is so good that none of what I mention here detracts from this video. I was a little disappointed in the fact that they did a keyboard only version of Honestly instead of the album, drum version. And, Its obvious, to me anyway, that they cut out a chunk of video during the Loud N Clear guitar solos, and I wish they would have left more of that in the final video project. At an hour and ten minutes, this video is worth every penny. The sound quality is very good. The drums are miced properly. Robert sweet is an incredible drummer. One of my favorite parts of his performance is when he takes a second to smile and point at the camera during All for One. The guitars are nice and beefy. Michael Sweet and Oz Fox are very talented guitarists. Timothy Gaines is an accomplished bassist, in his own right, and holds his own for the Loud N Clear solos. The overall mix is very good, and near-perfect in my opinion. A Stryper fan to any degree should enjoy this video. That being said, I would highly recommend this video to all Stryper fans. You will not be disappointed. I certainly wasnt. This video is a real joy to watch.",1432339200,,1521,4.303135888501743
5178727,5,B008QOH1NG,"When I was in high school, Stryper was one of my favorite bands.  Truth be told though, when ""Calling on you"" came out, it was something that helped me turn my life over to Jesus.  Being a musician, it hit me right between the eyes and really encouraged me.  Now, years later, I was amazed to see they were still playing together, and the performance was outstanding.  One of the BEST dual guitar acts EVER and they never missed a beat.  To top it all off, the lyrics meant a lot more to me at 46yrs of age - I knew all of the lyrics back then, but they had a substantially greater impact as I heard them for the first time in years.  These guys were bold and it's VERY encouraging to know that it wasn't just a gimmick - they truly accepted the truth and fought to present it to a generation of rock fans.  That truth is Jesus.",1430784000,,828,4.105590062111801

5178744,3,B008QOH1NG,"I enjoyed this recording of Stryper live, but their interaction with the Indonesian crowd was strained. I believe most of those in attendance had little idea of the bands significance or the meaning of their lyrics. The 'sing-along' portions were really sad. The other live recordings of Stryper (such as the one in PR) are much more enjoyable.

5178745,2,B008QOH1NG,"I've always been a fan of Stryper, so I was really looking forward to this video.  I've enjoyed the fact that they've stayed in it and kept producing new albums.  Michael's voice continues to be awesome!  This video showcases the band's talent, no argument there.  Every member of  the band exhibits amazing skill!  Robert's drumming is awesome!  Tim's bass rocks!  Oz is always shredding perfection.  I truly love these guys.... BUT... (if I may be bluntly honest) the bummer for me about this video was that they didn't appear to be having much fun.  It shows on their faces.  Even the crowd seems to know it and it was disappointing to watch Michael stopping the band to lecture the crowd on getting involved.  I'm glad I only rented this DVD... I will not be adding it to my collection, sadly.  All due respect to the guys because I love them and they remain one of my favorite bands (not to mention my brothers in Jesus), but I was just sad to watch this performance because they didn't seem to be having much fun.

I've played in a couple of bands myself and one thing I've learned is that EVEN IF YOU SUCK, the crowd will have a blast and think you're awesome if you're actually smiling and having fun playing.  I never would have believed that before seeing it, because I'm so picky about music...  But it's really true.  People are not just connecting with the music.  It's the whole experience and these guys need to totally let their lights shine because it's the best part about the music!  Maybe it wasn't a great day for them...  Maybe there were other things going on that just caused this impression to come across... and maybe it's just me... But I noticed it nevertheless and so this won't be my favorite Stryper video, unfortunately.

This video was a massive contrast to their earlier production ""Greatest Hits Live In Puerto Rico"", which was pure awesome and the guys totally appeared to be having lots of fun in that video... and Michael's singing performance in that video was absolutely tops as well!!!!  Way awesome!!!!

This one wasn't awful though...  There are some fantastic performances!  The music is awesome!  That's my only complaint; that it doesn't feel as fun as it should have.  Call me crazy.",1378512000,,2230,4.6368286445012785
5178746,5,B008QOH1NG,"I've seen Stryper live in concert twice, and I quickly realized they are one of the few bands that sound just as good live as they do on their recordings, if not better.  In my opinion, Michael Sweet has one of the greatest rock voices of all time, and 25 years after the band was at their pinnacle, he still hits those notes just like he always has.  This concert has a nice set list of familiar songs mixed with a few ""B-sides"", and their performance is top notch throughout.",1378425600,,477,4.288888888888889

I know none of their songs.

I watched it and thought the production was very well done. The band sounded good, the camera work was fantasic and the mix of the music seemed correct.

That's about all I can say since I know almost nothing about this band... If you are a Stryper fan, I would think you would like it?

5178751,4,B008QOH1NG,"I will qualify this review by first saying that I have seen Stryper twice in concert recently, once on the ""Reborn"" tour and once on the ""Murder by Pride"" and the performances by all were STELLAR.  I had also heard and seen the Puerto Rico concert and thought that while excellent, the more recent live concerts I went to sounded heavier and superior to that recording.  This is why I was SO stoked to get and watch ""Live At Java Rockin' Land"".  All of the potential seemed to be there.  Tim was back and with LONG hair, the had their new stryped outfits, etc.  I figured this would be the best live concert ever.  While it was very decent, I feel it fell quite a bit short of what it should have/could have been and I agree with the other review that felt the Puerto Rico DVD is better.

1.  The whole band must have been majorly jet-lagged from having to travel half-way around the world.  I have done this twice and it takes me at least 3-4 days to just get semi-OK feeling.  I can imagine the guys were seriously affected in their performance as a result of this.  Michael's vocals were amazing in the two concerts I went to recently and in this performance he obviously struggled.  In addition, the whole band seemed tired and lacking energy.  If you watch both this and the Puerto Rico video back to back, it is obvious they had a LOT more energy and were much more animated in that show.  I have no doubt the guys still possess the same energy so I will once again blame being fatigued by the journey.  Also, in the concerts I went to, while limited to stage size, the guys seemed plenty lively and I anticipated the same at least for this DVD.

2.  The crowd.  I generally prefer recorded live concerts to minimize crowd noise that distracts from the performance while still allowing it to enhance the effect of the overall experience.  This is obviously a delicate balance.  On this recording/performance though, the crowd seemed very foreign to the show (no pun intended).  Whether it was the production of the recording or the reality of what actually was the case, I thought the crowd feedback was audibly lacking.  In addition, when the cameras panned out to the crowd, it seemed like they were watching and responding to something very unfamiliar to them.  I am sure this is a very frustrating scenario to a band and came across as unpleasant to me, a fan, who hopes to feel a part of a huge, raging crowd that is experiencing an amazing performance as if I was there.

In summary, this concert is still a good performance and worth the price I paid.  It could have been spectacular though and if I had to buy only one, I would get the Puerto Rico show even though Tim's hair was short, their outfits were not as cool, Michael's hair was a little too retro-looking, and they didn't sound as heavy as in more recent performances.",1364342400,,2842,4.450676982591876

5178753,2,B008QOH1NG,"In my opinion, Stryper should move forward with songs from their new albums.  They have been back long enough now to wear out the greatness of their old songs.  On this video, they seem tired; thus the music is not that great.  Michael Sweet avoids hitting the high notes and rarely belts out those high-energy screams that we really enjoy.  They rely on their ""Celebrity"" status to carry this product because the quality is not there.  I love Stryper, but they should have prepared a better concert or concert setting where they could have put in at least 100%.",1363392000,,562,4.636363636363637

5178755,5,B008QOH1NG,"Let me begin by saying I just received my DVD today. I finished watching it and I am 100% satisfied! I have been a ""Stryper"" fan faithfully since their EP release ""Yellow and Black Attack"" in 1984. I have seen them when they where huge and also later and have never ever been let down. These guys just plain throw down and always have! This DVD sounds great! Has a real good mix for the sound. I thought I would miss the 5.1 Surround Sound but it sounded so good I can't complain. The live footage is shot very good and covers all members unlike alot of other videos I have seen by other bands. ""Stryper"" has always been incredible musicians as well as people and CAN HOLD UP TO ANY BAND ANY TIME. ""Michael Sweet"" and ""Oz Fox"" are simply one of the best guitar duo's you will ever see or hear. It is awesome having ""Tim Gaines"" back in the band after the short stint without him because he is an amazing bass player and singer. ""Robert Sweet"" of coarse is one of the coolest drummers ever and is rock solid still to this day. The band sounds very tight as they have been every concert I have seen. I do want to address some of the reviews about ""Michael's"" singing. People have said he can't hit the notes like he used to. This is what I suggest to those people. You might want to take another listen because ""Michael"" hits his trademark highs very well just for instance on the ending of ""The Way"" ""To Hell With The Devil"" and check out his excellant vocal intro for ""Soldiers Under Command"" with the croud and again smoking vocal ending for that song. ""Michael"" has always sang with the croud and let the croud sing. The reason is because the fans like the band so much and he gets them into it. Why not let them join in the fun. ""Michael Sweet"" is one of the coolest lead guitar front men bar none still to this day and still has an incredible voice. If you like Stryper do yourself a favor and buy this because you will love it. My son who is 16 grew up listening to Stryper and his words to me after was that they are one of the best live bands he has ever seen and couldn't believe how tight they were. Very cool DVD!

Musicianship is tight and the twin leads and trade off's of Michael & Oz are most excellent, while Tim lays down some cool bass riffage and Robert follows with lots of nice fills. Overall the sound quality sounded pretty amazing on my Yamha 7- channel surround sound system....sending my neighbors screaming for more!!
Michael's vocal's have tamed down over the yrs. and he doesent get some of the high notes he once did, but he is pushin' 50, so with that said....he still sound rather awesome and they still put on a good show....plus have not lost any talent whatsoever!
This is a good buy for anyone who like high voltage rock'nroll !",1357257600,,802,4.493150684931507
5178757,1,B008QOH1NG,"It was the worst dvd i every bought.  production was good, but their best song honestly was done with just a piano no strong ballad and if that wasn't enogh, he had the crowd sing most of the lyrics.  DONT BUY THIS",1357084800,,214,4.071428571428571
