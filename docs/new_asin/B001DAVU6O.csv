8292459,4,B001DAVU6O,"This was a movie that explores what will happen to the filmmaker's brother once his parents are no longer around to care for him.  It was done in a loving, respectful manner.  It reveals his life from childhood to adulthood to us through conversations with him and his family.  The camera follows him into his job search and daily life.  I am thankful to get this glimpse into the challenges of one man and to get an honest glimpse into how it can affect the whole family.",1287964800,,472,4.390804597701149
