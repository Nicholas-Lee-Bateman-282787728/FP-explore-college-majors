1579039,5,B00005JP2O,"I saw this movie a couple of times on afternoon TV at least forty years ago and would give anything to have it on DVD. It's a hilarious farce with Tallulah Bankhead giving an unforgettable (well, obviously) performance, ranging from sharp wit to pure slapstick. Catherine the Great, a part she was born to play, and admirably backed up by a stellar supporting cast. It was prepared and partially shot by Lubitsch, then when he fell ill Otto Preminger took over. Please bring it back!",1193961600,14,483,4.694117647058824
1579230,4,B00005JP2O,"Lubitsch may have been aging at the time, but he had the ability to handle this kind of close-to-censorable material with the aplomb he had always shown.  Of course, this is a rare time to watch Tallulah in action.  Nothing in the plot matters when she lets loose with that voice and that dialogue.  And William Eythe, wrongfully thought of as 'bland', is quite on the mark as her 'wished-for conquest'. It remains film to savor.  A fine film at the time of the director's fine 'Cluny Brown'.",1370563200,5,492,4.556818181818182
1579231,5,B00005JP2O,This is a rarely seen and never available film until now when 20th Century Fox releases their pristine print of a classic film. This is the fabulous Tallulah Bankhead at her royal best with snappy hilarious dialogue. This is Ernst Lubitsch at his finest. Beautiful costumes and sets with a rarely seen Tallulah in all her glory. A must!,1366416000,4,336,4.711864406779661
1579232,4,B00005JP2O,"""A Royal Scandal"" is a Royal Treat with members of the Hollywood royal comedy teams of the 40s. The film was developed by comedy master Ernst Lubitsch (1892-1947) who gave us such memorable films as ""Ninotchka"" (1939), ""The Shop Around the Corner"" (1940), and ""To Be or Not to Be"" (1942). Multi-talented Otto Preminger took the directing reigns when Lubitch got sick, and stayed true to Lubitsch's intentions. Lubitsch liked to say ""Nobody should try to play comedy unless they have a circus going on inside"", and this film is every bit a fun circus with fast delivered witty lines, slapstick at every turn, and marvelous tongue-in-cheek performances from all.

The film features Tallulah Bankhead as Catherine the Great with Charles Coburn, Anne Baxter, Mischa Auer, and Sig Ruman as members of her court. William Eythe co-stars as Bankhead's love interest.

Tallulah Bankhead (1902-68) was more of a personal force than an actress, although she had many memorable performances to her credit, including her award winning role as the cynical journalist in ""Lifeboat"" (1944). This is perhaps her finest screen role.

Fat and funny Sig Ruman (1884-1967) was everyone's favorite German, best known as Sgt. Schulz from ""Stalag 17"" (1953) and opera owner Hermann Gottlieb in ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935). He plays a rebellious General.

Mischa Auer (1905-67) was nominated for an Oscar for his role in ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936), one of more than 100+ films he made, often playing a foreigner in films like ""Clive of India"" (1935) and ""Anna Karenina"" (1935). I liked him best as the ballet teacher from ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938).

Charles Coburn (1877-1961) plays Catherine's Chancellor. He appeared in more than 50 films, from 1933 through 1962. He was nominated for an Oscar 3 times and won once (""The More the Merrier"" in 1943). I remember him best as ""Piggy"" in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blonds"" (1953).

Bosley Crowther in The NY Times called it ""an oddly dull and generally witless show"". But Variety said ""A Royal Scandal is a highly hilarious comedy with superb performances"" and called it ""a farce of real proportions.""

The reason for the mixed messages on this film is that this 1945 comedy seems more like a 30s screwball comedy or one of the Marx Brothers films from that era. So it's slightly out of sync with the times. Comedy in the mid 40s was more oriented to films from Frank Capra (It's a Wonderful Life"") Preston Sturges (""Sullivan's Travels"", ""Hail the Conquering Hero""), Hope/Crosby Road shows, and Tracy-Hepburn comedies.

1945 was not a banner year for films. The top grossing films were ""Mom and Dad"", ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", ""Leave Her to Heaven"", ""Spellbound"", and ""Anchors Aweigh."" The big Oscar and Golden Globe winner was ""The Lost Weekend"" (Picture, Director, Actor). Notable films released that year included: Joan Crawford's Oscar winning ""Mildred Pierce"" and film noir classic ""Scarlett Street"".

Bottom line - a great 30s style comedy with some of the masters of screen comedy.",1345161600,,3011,4.98207171314741

1579234,5,B00005JP2O,"I was deLIghted to see this old film by Otto Preminger again.  I first saw it in
auckland in 1949 and have wanted to see it again ever since.  By the magic of Amazon.com I have realised that second watching.  Ernst LUbitsch produced many great comedies like Ninotchka, &  Tovarich with Garbo and Colbert;  but this one makes fun of Catharine of Russia in a delightful way.  When Tallulah Bankhead finds her treasurer, Charles Coburn, has dipped into the till,  she says ""I don't mind you taking a little out of the treasury, but Nicolai,  take it easy"".  And when Catherine is furious with her maid (Anne Baxter) and picks up a vase,  Anne says , handing her another vase, ""Not that vase, your Majesty,  that's your Majesty's favourite""
It's situations like thia that make this film unique.  Even to the end when Vincent Price as the French Ambassador arrives at her Court.  Tallulah says ""I'm lonelier than all the lonely women in all my lonely lands""  What Vincent says next you'll have to get the movie to find out.  Jonathan",1324339200,2,1028,4.602209944751381
1579235,4,B00005JP2O,"After he had ""Laura"" under his belt (which some people erroneously say he merely followed Rouben Mamoulian's blueprint, another director he replaced) in 1944, Otto Preminger accepted the directorial helm from another ailing master, Ernst Lubitsch for a comedy titled ""A Royal Scandal"" (GB title: ""Czarina"") in 1945, the same year he directed another film noir classic, ""Fallen Angel.""  Otto insisted that the film star his friend, Tallulah Bankhead (who had just done Alfred Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"") and cast Anne Baxter, Vincent Price, Charles Coburn and especially William Eythe, a 20th Century-Fox lead actor who had appeared in ""The Ox-Bow Incident"" and ""Song of Bernadette"" before Otto again cast him in ""Centennial Summer.""  Eythe had the choice role of the 24 year old soldier the Czarina, Catherine the Great (Bankhead) uses as her latest boy toy, who had been Anne Baxter's fiance.  The rivalry between Bankhead and Baxter is done VERY Preminger and the casting of Eythe is similarly curious, if after seeing Otto's films, to know Otto can cast very well and effectively, and a sign of his pleasure with them, repeatedly.  Despite reviewers, Eythe holds up with solid professional Bankhead quite well.  Otto did not have the greatest success with ""A Royal Scandal,"" but looking at it several times, it improves with viewings and (the week I bought this DVD, it sold out all available copies except a used copy for over $83.) so I am probably not alone to feel it is fashionable all over again.  I can only imagine what would be done with this premise today, but here it remains completely delightful.  As was not the case with ""Laura,"" for ""A Royal Scandal,"" Lubitsch, who had suffered a heart attack, retained producer credit, so I suppose Otto was a little cramped in being free to be himself.  This edition is an import from Portugal and Spain but also in English, all regions, full screen, b&w.",1319673600,6,1906,4.952978056426332

readings. Pic was s'posed to be directed by Lubitsch,

humorless Otto Preminger. (Did Otto ever direct a good
movie? 'Laura,' you say...he followed the Mamoulian
blueprint). To quote Walter Kerr on Tallulah: ""She presides
over the party like a fabulous hostess."" As Catherine the Great,
Tallulah is mighty funny. With ""Lifeboat"" we have two visuals
of the legendary Tallulah. The souffle occasionally rises here,

1579237,3,B00005JP2O,"When I was a kid I saw this movie five days in a row on ""Million Dollar Movie,"" a New York City TV show of the late 1950s.  As a ten year-old, I was enchanted by the sets and costumes, by what I thought was scintillating dialogue, and by Tallulah Bankhead, Charles Coburn and Vincent Price.  I never forgot it, and was thrilled when it finally showed up on DVD.

Well...what a disappointment!  Yes, Vincent Price is wonderful in the two scenes in which he appears (""Some say, 'See Naples, and die'...I say, 'See Catherine...and live!"").  Coburn does his droll best to move things along. And Bankhead does occasionally amuse as the spoiled, lascivious autocrat of all the Russias.

But...comedy?  It falls very, very flat.  I blame Otto Preminger's direction for this -- it is so heavy-handed that it just weighs down the entire film, which congeals like a huge lump of cold overcooked pasta.  If only Lubitsch had directed; this film and script are the sort of things he lent his light satirical touch to so well.

And finally, there is William Eythe, the Tyrone Power lookalike whom Catherine promotes on a daily basis from a simple lieutenant on the western front to commander of the palace guard.  He's just awful -- frantic, breathless, and one-note throughout.

Sometimes childhood memories are utterly false.",1248652800,4,1314,4.816964285714286
1579238,5,B00005JP2O,"A Royal Scandal has taken a critical drubbing over the year and director Preminger professed not to like it. The film is brilliantly paced (rapid fire and crackling dialogue throughout), superbly acted, magnificently designed and photographed, and scored very creatively by Alfred Newman. One sees the seeds for Tallulah's famous offstage character in her shameless cruising of the young soldier who wants no greater glory than to be close to the throne and at this point she is young enough to pull it off gracefully, veering just to the edge of camp without crossing the line. Charles Coburn is very wisely used; a consummate reactor, he is often seen in the background tellingly reacting to two characters' interaction in the foreground. Anne Baxter brings fire and music to her role as the soldier's fiance and Vincent Price brings a great deal of wit to what is little more than a cameo as the French ambassador.

Talullah's film appearances were few (The Cheat only recently released on DVD) and this showed her at her forte: comedy. Granted, she was also one of the great dramatic actresses of her day - her performance in The Little Foxes on Broadway is considered to be one of the finest of the 20th century - but more marketable actresses always won out over her in Hollywood; she never forgave Bette Davis for ""stealing"" the role of Regina in Foxes from her.",1238371200,8,1369,4.8008474576271185
1579239,4,B00005JP2O,"**** 1945. Directed by Otto Preminger. St.-Petersburg, Russia. XVIIIth century. Catherine the Great has just fired her last lover when she meets the naive Alexei Chernoff who wants to warn her against a possible revolution. This film was meant to be directed by Ernst Lubitsch who chose the script before falling ill. Nonetheless, ROYAL SCANDAL remains a sophisticated comedy  la Lubitsch with witty and energetic dialogues. Tallulah Bankhead, Charles Coburn, Anne Baxter, William Eythe, Vincent Price and Sig Ruman are all given the opportunity to present a one (wo-) man show worth remembering. Highly recommended.

In addition to the present edition, you can find a zone 2 DVD released by the BFI (British Film Institute) at amazon.co.uk or another zone 2 DVD released by Columbia Classics at amazon.fr.",1211155200,6,806,5.2890625
7942017,2,B00005JP2O,"The name above the title is ""Ernst Lubitsch"" but don't be fooled. According to IMDB, he wrote the script and began the work on this film, but after he became ill, Otto Preminger took the reins  and is credited as director. As I watched this film (Fox Cinema Archives DVD), there were hints of Lubitsch, but it never came to level of the sophisticated comedy of Lubitsch. The movie started off  with touches of comedy, but didn't have much of a plot, and then tried to be dramatic and tragic at the end, and everything ended up in a mess. Tallulah was spicy as usual, but she just didn't seem to fit the role of Catherine the Great. Anne Baxter's role was too small and really didn't work for her, and who's this guy William Eythe? I'd never heard of him until this film. That role should have been Tyrone Power's, surely. So, with a replaced director, convoluted script and miscast actors, this one was a let-down. Fox needs to release some ""real"" classic films from their vaults and leave these ho-hums on the shelf or as fillers in box sets.",1524009600,,1043,4.455497382198953

7942019,4,B00005JP2O,"""A Royal Scandal"" is a funny film.  Directed by the ponderous Otto Preminger but designed, prepared and produced by a failing Ernst Lubitsch, the mark of the latter is more obvious than the former.  Tallulah Bankhead has a great part as Catherine the Great, the ""mother of Russia"" and she is very funny.  This may be the best memorial on film of her razor-sharp skill as a comedic actress.  She dominates and when she is off camera, you eagerly await her next appearance.  Like all Lubitsch films, there is a great supporting cast, including sly Charles Coburn, often visible in the background and upstaging the other actors with his facial expressions, Vincent Price in an hilarious parody of a French consul and Sig Ruman as the head of the traitors. Anne Baxter plays a maid-in-waiting and is OK. William Eythe plays the dim-witted young soldier who catches Catherine's eye and is also very funny.  He and Bankhead are a great team.  The film is also superbly produced with great sets, costumes and photography, a sumptuous production in every way.

The film is one of the Fox Cinema Archive Series and the good news is the print is excellent although this series are bare bones; a pity too, because a little research indicates that there was plenty going on behind the scenes and information about all that would have been welcome.",1451260800,,1335,4.773913043478261

7942023,5,B00005JP2O,"This is a true classic film starring Tallulah Bankhead as the Russian Empress, Catherine the Great, and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. The film was based on the play ""Die Zarin"" (The Czarina) by Lajos B&iacute;r&oacute; and Melchior Lengyel in which the Russian empress falls in love with a young lieutenant named Alexei Chernoff, and later she appoints him as the Chief of the Imperial Guard. This film is remake of the silent movie, ""Forbidden Paradise"" (1924), also directed by Lubitsch, and starred Pola Negri as Catherine the Great.

Tallulah Bankhead in the leading role is simple great. Her deep voice is well suited in her seduction scenes with sixteen years younger Chernoff, played by William Eythe.  Bankhead's costumes are fabulous and the jewelry exquisite. I thoroughly enjoyed this film which has that ""Lubitsch touch.""
