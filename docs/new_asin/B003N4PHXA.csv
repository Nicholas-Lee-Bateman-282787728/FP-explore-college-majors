8598226,2,B003N4PHXA,"Out of the 8 movies of this package, 3 movies for some odd reason would freeze.
I tried the same 3 movies in another dvd player just in case mine was acting up.  Still freezing.
A little disappointed because my father was so looking forward to watching these movies.
The other 5 movies were great. Image--nice and clear.  Sound--good taking in consideration when movies were made.",1390348800,,380,4.742424242424242
