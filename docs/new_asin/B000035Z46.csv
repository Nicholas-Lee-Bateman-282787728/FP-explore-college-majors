1259793,4,B000035Z46,"I am a Disney fan.  Quoting ""Roger Rabbit"", ""Goofy's a genius.""  This movie  does not disappoint in its quality.  On the whole it is a very good movie, but  They have done much better.  Goofy  isn't goofy enough.  His son is too cynical, the situations that Goofy gets  into could be a bit more fantastic.  It's just missing a notch that Disney  and Goofy usually give us.",955584000,,372,4.402985074626866
1259794,5,B000035Z46,"Don't buy this expecting a sequel to 'A Goofy Movie'. The only similiarity is the cast...minus Roxanne. Alright, she was cute, but the plot of X-Goofy isn't romance...(that's for Goofy and Sylvia (proof that you DON'T have to  be skinny to look hot in a jumpsuit!))...but of Max and the boys winning  the X-games and of course...the wonderfully touching generation gap between  father and son. The disco sequence and the dancing behind the credits are  worth the price alone. Bobby had me on the *floor*! ^_^",954979200,,508,4.872093023255814
1259795,2,B000035Z46,i simply didn't think anything of this movie.it was hilarious in some parts but the rest was just okay.not too bad for a sequel but i liked the first one better,953164800,,160,4.193548387096774
1259796,5,B000035Z46,"""~I was a big fan of the original 'A Goofy Movie' and was eagerly awaiting the sequel when I saw an advertisement for it prior to Thanksgiving in 1999.""~ hand has visions of freedom and the 'X games' dancing in his head and presumably girls and keggers as well; though he  former is glossed over and the latter ignored for the sake of the small  set. These dreams are rudely interrupted by the return of Goofy who,  dressed in '70's clothes, immediately begins treating his boy as, well his  boy.""~ cheating to accomplish that. a movie that would have worked on  the big screen.  Go buy it.",953078400,,590,4.4672897196261685
1259797,4,B000035Z46,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie.  Actually, I expected it to be similar to the bad sequels that Disney usually puts out.  Most straight to video sequels tend to have bad animation quality.  The quality of  animation was good in this ""Goofy"" sequel.  I was starting high  school with the first ""Goofy"" movie.  Coincidence that Max and I  started college ""together"".  It was really touching to see how  such a big event as going to college in life impacts both parents and  children.  I was glad to see PJ get a girl!  The whole coffe house scene  was very amusing. lol",952646400,2,580,4.451923076923077
1259798,4,B000035Z46,"While this, in my opinion, didn't live up to the first movie, it was a well-done sequel.  The boys have grown up (including, thank God, Bobby), and are ready to move out ... except Max's past, or, rather, his Dad, keeps  haunting him.
There are parts that were superb, including ""beret  girl's"" fixation on PJ (the fat guy finally scores! :) ), and the  introduction of Miss Marpole as Goofy's ""distraction"" was beyond  excellent.  Like another reviewer, I severely missed Roxanne; she should've  joined the guys at State U.
So why was it inferior to the first?  Possibly because it rehashes situations that, I thought, were resolved in  the first movie.  I thought Max had finally dealt with being the son of  Goofy, yet here we see he hasn't.  It's almost like the PowerLine concert  never happened.  It just didn't make sense.",952646400,,829,4.746478873239437
1259799,5,B000035Z46,"An Extremely Goofy Movie is one of the best animated features to come from Disney in a long time. Unlike their recent paint by number theatrical releases that emphasize marketable characters and a predictable formula  this film has a charming and refreshing story, vibrant artwork and best of  all, Goofy. This is a good follow-up for A Goofy Movie. If you're looking  for an animated film the whole family can enjoy this is it.",952128000,,428,4.756756756756757
1259800,2,B000035Z46,"This watched more like an episode of the tv series ""Goof Troop"" than a real movie.  Same underdeveloped plot, same predictable slapstick, and what the heck happened to Bobby?  He used to be the coolest cat around,  but now?  Shame on you Disney.  Shame.",952128000,3,253,4.659090909090909
1259801,2,B000035Z46,"I'm sorry, but the Disney folk are both geniuses and idiots at the same time. First they released ""A Goofy Movie"" a few years back; this was an incredible and hilarious film that many people enjoyed. And based on  the success of this first film, they have just released this  direct-to-video sequel (a la ""Aladdin: Return of Jafar"" and  ""The Lion King II: Simba's Pride""). However, this second  installment, while not terrible, is significantly worse than the first one.  Now, the Disney folks are geniuses because they banked on the success of  the previous one and are hoping that it's success will carry over into this  new one. And they are idiots because, had they actually made this second  one GOOD, many more people would have paid even bigger bucks to perhaps see  a third installment in a few years... unfortunately, Disney does not think  that far ahead (Sorry, Mr. Eisner. I love Splash Mountain, though. And the  Twilight Zone Tower of Terror).",951868800,9,957,4.809815950920245

When she opened the box & saw what was inside she had tears in her eyes. We later watched it & it was perfect. Thank you, Amazon.",1514073600,,272,3.6271186440677967
1259823,3,B000035Z46,"The original Goofy Movie is great.  It's touching story and yet delightfully goofy in nature.  This sequel just doesn't quite hit the spot.  Its got its goofy moments but it comes across more cheesy than goofy.  It's still a fun watch with the kids but it's not the kind of movie that has a lot f rewatch value, whereas I'd re-watch the original.",1513641600,,346,4.444444444444445

She loves seeing Goofy on his own with a son going away to college.  I find the story line interesting enough to watch along with her.  There are some references that she probably doesn't get, like when Goofy is daydreaming back to the 70's and everything is getting all psychedelic, but the story is pretty easy to follow along.  I recommend this for any Disney Fan.",1471132800,,498,4.428571428571429

I haven't seen the original ""Goofy Movie"", but I may. For a supposedly silly kid-flick I was surprised at the depth of the real-life pathos, having gone through the parent/child separation agony (both as the child and later on as the parent), been fired by a demonic boss at a killer-drudge factory job, (Goofy's Unemployment Office lady was much more compassionate than the frustrating apathy I received!), returned to college as an older student, and taken an embarrassingly hard class from a teacher who was my recent ex-wife! The movie may be a bit too heavy for little kids (or a great lesson in managing-enduring real-life hassles). I was glad to see the fat kid get a sharp and competent girl. And I must admit, Miss Marpole was so hot I thought my screen was going to ignite! Was I happy that even an aging Goofy can find true love? ... or was I jealous because she was such a ""fox""??!! I laughed, I cried, I sweated and even got tremors! Any more stimulation and I may have had a heart-attack!

1260152,3,B000035Z46,"An Extremely Goofy Movie is a direct-to-video sequel, and it shows. Goofy and his son Max star in another movie about the two coming to terms with each other despite their differences. Therein lies the movie's weakness. A Goofy Movie had already done this. Was there really need for the same scenario to unfold; Max being embarrassed by his dad and learning to accept him? Goofy learning to let go and realize Max was an adult? An Extremely Goofy Movie is about both these things, and not as strongly developed.

Max is now going off to college with his friends PJ and Bobby. Max is intensely relieved to be rid of his dad, and looks forward to the three of them winning the College X-Games (involving rollerskating, bicycling and skateboarding among other things). Goofy is on the complete other shoe, depressed about Max moving away from home. This melancholy inadvertently causes him to lose his job at the factory. Realizing that he can only get another job by earning a college degree, Goofy enrolls in Max's college, to his horror. Cue Goofy's lack of parental distance. Things get worse when Goofy ends up being selected to join the Gammas, the X-Games champions and Max's arch-rivals.

I found myself very annoyed at both Max and Goofy during this film. Whereas in A Goofy Movie, you both understood and were frustrated by the pair of them, here they both were just bang out of order on so many occasions. Goofy goes beyond just being overly upset about letting Max go off to live his life; he barges into Max's dorm room, takes seats next to his son when Max is inviting a girl to sit there, the list goes on and on. Max is just as frustrating. Here, he is about 50% less mature than he was in A Goofy Movie; snotty and braggy, and very much mean to his father on many occasions. Pride comes before you take a fall, Max. Why, exactly, is winning the X-Games so important to him, anyway? Way more important than college itself, apparently. He's hardly a likeable character at all in this film, which is a bad thing. Annoying as he is as well, I usually found myself on Goofy's side.

Furthermore, where is Roxanne? The movie makes no acknowledgement that she even exists, and this after everything Max went through in A Goofy Movie to impress her. Also, Bradley Uppercrust the Third and his posse the Gammas get away with just too many things in the movie. No marginally organized sporting event would let what they do go by unnoticed; they even pull off many tricks with crowds of people around them!

Having said all of that, I still enjoy An Extremely Goofy Movie. Goofy is a riot as ever, especially when he gets into that 70s groove of his (being when he last was at college). Him dealing with his son having grown up and going to college really touches a chord with me, being at college myself. Goofy's romance with the ungainly college librarian, Sylvia, is wonderful; we don't often get to see Goofy in love, and he and Sylvia make a cute couple. We have other great supporting characters such as Tank, Bradley's muscle and the two duelling X-game reporters.

Finally, the movie LOOKS great! The character animation is all first class, especially for a direct-to-video Disney sequel. Take Return of Jafar and compare the animation in that with An Extremely Goofy Movie; like night and day. The music is alright, and has a distinct 70s flair whenever Goofy is in that mode. It's just a shame that there are no real musical numbers; none of the characters sing in this movie.

Overall, An Extremely Goofy Movie is an entertaining, heartwarming watch. It has its shortcomings to match, though, and in the end, it only ends up as average, beautiful in terms of character animation but ugly in terms of story and character development. See it if you must, but don't expect it to hold up on repeat viewings.",1316908800,2,3817,4.622418879056047
1260153,1,B000035Z46,"Whoever said sequels aren't always as good as their predecessors is describing ""An Extremely Goofy Movie"". A very disappointing sequel that isn't even half as good as ""A Goofy Movie"" with none of the main characters doing any songs in the film and some previous characters are omitted from the film. The movie's story line surrounds Goofy more then it does both him and his son, Max, but still follows the same plot as the first film (Goofy and Max getting stuck in a position where they have to work things out between them and find the bond between father and son) not something that should have been repeated if you ask me. As far as I'm concerned I have seen it but have no intentions of owning it. If you wanna good ""Goofy Movie"" get the first one not this one. I can say I think they need to bring out a 3rd and final film so we can find out what happened to the missing characters (Stacey & Roxanne).

That is my opinion on this movie.",1270598400,4,942,4.292134831460674

1260168,5,B000035Z46,"From the great Disney cartoon classic shorts to the modern cartoons, characters like Goofy have been loved by all. Other characters have moved in directions like Goofy's ""Goof Troop"" with Max; Chip & Dale became ""Rescue Rangers"" and met up with Monterey Jack, Gadget, etc.; Pooh created great new movies and the cherished New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. These modernized cartoons have preserved the charm of the original cartoon shorts. ""A Goofy Movie"" was wonderful--the music was well-written, the story was entertaining, sincere, and humorous, the animation was colorful and attractive. ""An Extremely Goofy Movie"" continues the story of modern-day father Goofy and his relationship with his son, Max. Goofy's still as goofy as he was in his original cartoons, and Max would seem to be have been inspired by the young son given to Goofy in some of the short cartoons. This sequel to the Goofy Movie is excellent like the first one. The beginning focuses on Max's departure to college, which is touching. The college itself is fun to watch as it has a very diverse campus. Roxanne, my favorite character in the original, is not featured in this movie, which initially seems a disappointment or discontinuity. However, when one considers that high school crushes are usually not lasting things, and the reality that Roxanne would have been more likely to attend a different school...it seems that for once Disney did move in a more 'real life' direction rather than a 'cute' one, where the two of them would've still been together. I still would have liked to see her again, or hear her name mentioned, or see the graduation ceremony. One can only hope that she moved on to success and happiness; she seems like the type who will. But this movie goes straight into Max's college career and does it well. It DOES lack great music, but the tunes somehow manage to go without being terribly missed. Goofy, in fact, ends up requiring a degree and, of course, much to his son's chagrin, joining him for his first year of college. The overarching plotline of this movie follows Max, PJ, and Bobby's (yes, they all DID go to the same college) ambitious X Games endeavor to unseat Bradley Uppercrust III (one of the few characters I've found who's not only meant to be dislikable but actually is) and his Gammas as the skateboarding kings of the campus. Of course, this intertwines with the theme of father/son bonding and how Goofy wants Max to see that focusing on his goals is the only way to achieve success in his future. To me, the more interesting parts of the movie occur when Goofy falls in love with Sylvia Marpole, the librarian who shares his passion for 70's memorabilia and disco, and when PJ hooks up with the 'beret girl' who hangs out at the Bean Scene Cafe.

Goofy falling in love sounds like it would be cliche, predictable, and corny/cheesy, right? Actually, it's not...it's nicely done. Sylvia is quite compatible with him and an interesting, well-developed character (especially for only being introduced in this one film). The same goes for the smart, poetic Beret Girl who sees something in PJ that other girls don't, and becomes his girlfriend. Character design and development in this (and actually, both Goofy Movies) is quite good. Sylvia and Beret (would be nice to call her by a name, but somehow it seems fitting with her that we're not allowed to know her name...hmmm!) reminded me vaguely of Chel from 'The Road to El Dorado.' I am much more impressed with this movie, however.

From the great cartoon classics to the modern Goofy Movies that have evolved, it's clear that he's one of those characters who always turns out wonderful animation and never disappoints.",1120176000,,3693,4.841772151898734

Hilarity ensues as Goofy is forced to get a college education to further himself, ending up attending the same school as Max.  Skateboarding, bad hair, and disco music pepper the remainder of the film, giving you a real sense of closure in the storyline when the end finally arrives, however it does leave things open ended enough to ask the question ""The Goofiest Movie?""
The DVD release is fabulous.  The menus are a bit obnoxious, and the bonus content is not as thorough as one would like it (what is ""Kids Nuttiest Jokes"" doing on here?), but it's nice to get a ""widescreen"" version of the film (even if it isn't 'true' widescreen) - an option offered only to viewers of the UK ""Goofy Movie"" DVD.

I've been watching animation for a while, and this has to be one of my favortie Disney movies so far. Although I wasn't too anxious for it's release (considering Disney was squirting out sequels like mad at the time), I found it very entertaining with great morals without sacrificing the entertainment. You still have your classic Goofy slapstick for the younger viewers, real life conflicts, and some stuff only the adults will get; so it's a win-win for everyone. The animation was also quite good, for a sequel anyway. In relation to the first Goofy movie, this one might appeal more to the older audiences in the sence there are less out-there humorous situations, and more down-to-earth events with the college. I also found the college backdrop to be quite enriching to the story, and the skateboarding theme was good, both of which have never been seen in Disney before. Oh, and the 'villian team who cheats like crazy' maybe a tad predictable, but let me just say Bradley Uppercrust the Third is by far one of the best villians I have ever seen. Amoung one of the many new characters, he is the college hero (a real ladies man) and therefore is not a stereotypical evil Disney villian (trust me, you'll come to love his evil grin too). All, and all, this was a superb movie in all aspects and is a great video for families, animation lovers, people who just can't get out of the 70's, or people who just want to see the great villany (::sigh::).",1002931200,2,1615,4.690140845070423

This has the same sort of theme as the former, but presents it in a fresh, new way, unlike some Disney sequels with reused and borrowed plots.  Basiclly, this is an outline of the plot: When Max goes off to collage, Goofy gets fired from his job because he's thinking about him instead of doing the work.  When he applies for a new one elsewhere, he finds out that they won't grant him one because he doesn't have a full collage dagree.  Any Goofy fan can figure out what happens next--Goofy goes to collage.  THE SAME COLLAGE THAT MAX IS ATTENDING.  From there, it just gets funnier and funnier as Goofy falls in love with the librarian (yes, believe it but don't ask), and more.  The nice thing is that this movie is a worthy follow-up to the first, not just some old thing they make in an hour and throw out on the market in a fancy case so they can make some $$.  While not perfect, neither was ""Goofy Movie"", and this follows it rather nicely.  It embodies the same youthful spirit that Goofy has always had, and will please the fans.  Good job, Disney--well done.",972691200,5,1359,4.4534412955465585
1260188,4,B000035Z46,"Having never seen the original ""Goofy Movie"" I really had nothing to compare this to, except the old ""Goof Troop"" series.  However, I found this video very entertaining.  Despite the rather cliched situations found in pretty much every college movie (the college is ALWAYS an old, east-coast style school with old brick buildings and ivy-covered walls, there's ALWAYS a ""big game"" at the end, although the whole ""X-Games"" motif was rather refreshing, and ALWAYS an evil fraternity who cheats to win, although you would think someone would notice the rocket skateboards and various acts of sabotage...) they play with these conventions to create a heartwarming and touching narrative about the bond between a father and his son.  It is so exciting to see Max realize that his father is pretty cool after all, and Goofy realize that Max has grown up and they both need to get on with their lives.  It's also interesting to see an older and somewhat wiser group of characters since the ""Goof Troop"" series... you don't see cartoons age a lot in American animation... we see Goofy a little less frantic than his early days in the old Disney shorts, trying to control (yet not all that well) his innate klutziness, we see Max's change from the happy-go-lucky middle schooler in ""Goof Troop"" to an embittered yet honest young man, and we see P.J. (the stereotypical fat kid) display some ""hidden talents"" and get the girl at the end.  While they could have done a lot more with the story, Disney has produced a charming and humorous narrative which has a simple yet cool message for kids, and some inside humor and nifty nostalgia for adults.  Hopefully this is not the end of a trend of good direct-to-video releases.",971568000,2,1712,4.8061224489795915

1260190,5,B000035Z46,I think that the Extremely Goofy Movie is the best movie Disney has made. It is so funny but it is also based on true feeling. It is a great movie and I advise that if you havn't seen this movie that you really should. It  is great if you are babysitting!

7916879,5,B000035Z46,"I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that A feel-good, laugh-along winner! (Michael Trotman, Family Fun Magazine) Join Goofy and his son Max in a hip and hilarious all-new movie that kicks up outrageous fun on the road to higher education. It's all extreme sports and a life of freedom as Max sets off for college but Goofy misses Max so much, he literally falls down on the job. The laughs come fast and furious as he shows up, leisure suit and all, to finish college alongside Max and his friends. When Goofy meets the librarian, they hit it off and spark a stuck-in-the-seventies disco inferno that steals the show. But as Goofy tries to get closer to Max, both must go the the extreme to learn how to live their own lives... together! From inspired high-energy music to the antics of one of Disney's most beloved dads, An Extremely Goofy Movie proves that two Goofs are better than one! What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.",1518480000,,1045,4.447916666666667
