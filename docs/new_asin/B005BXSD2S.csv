8464413,2,B005BXSD2S,"In this movie you are watching a young boy as he lives a few weeks, or maybe a few months, of his life. It seems very realistic, perhaps too realistic because nothing exciting ever happens.

Personally I found Yusuf somewhat annoying. He drifts through life dreaming of doing better, but does nothing to fulfill these dreams. He wants to do well in school but is unwilling to do his homework. He cheats on his school work in more than one way, memorizing a story and pretending to read, and stealing homework from another boy.

He seems to have very little compassion for others, such as the boy whom he stole the homework from. In fact he shows very little emotion at all. It is obvious he idolizes his father (which is to be expected at that age) but at the same time seems standoffish around him. Even after his father has been gone so long that it is obvious something is wrong Yusuf shows no strong emotion. As a result I did not feel any emotional tie to the character which is one reason I felt let down by the movie.

From the buildup for this movie I expected more.",1433808000,,1074,4.36
8464414,5,B005BXSD2S,"This is the best portrayal of stuttering I've ever seen on film. In my opinion, better than Rocket Science, and even The King's Speech. And on top of that, it's a beautiful film all around -- story, acting, and directing. I was amazed by it.",1414281600,,241,4.377777777777778
8464415,5,B005BXSD2S,"Set in the Black Sea area of Turkey, BAL is a vivid depiction of village life under threat.  Yakup (Erdal Besikcioglu) tries to make a living collecting honey, but finds that there is no money in it.  He travels to another part of the region in search of better prospects, but meets a sticky end.  His fellow-villagers eke out an existence through traditional pursuits such as rope-making, but they cannot really survive.  The main focus of the action is on Yusuf (Bora Altas) a young boy who feels unable to communicate with the outside world; possessed of a stammer, he is frequently laughed at by his classmates.  The only was he can survive is through dreams of a better life - whether it be in the Black Sea region, or as symbolized by the elements (such as the moon).  The cinematic style is slow, with plenty of long shots allowing viewers to contemplate the characters' reactions within the frame.  However director Semih Kaplanoglu uses this style to make an acute commentary on a declining way of life, as well as showing the ways in which children are often forced to do things they don't want to, both at home and at school.  A complex film that befits repeated viewings.",1384387200,,1183,4.626794258373206
8464416,2,B005BXSD2S,"I bought this film based on its word of mouth greatness. But I was very disappointed. It was like watching a silent movie. Very few people spoke. There were many scenes where the actors were starring at someone or something for what seemed like an eternity. The last scene shows the boy asleep beneath a tree sleeping for over a minute. How long does it take to show someone asleep?  The plot was disappointing to say the least.

The story involved a little boy whose father is a bee keeper. It appears the father has epliepsy but no mention is made of it. The boy has a severe stutttering problem too. Once again, it behaves like a silent movie. I could go on and on.

If you look at the screen credits, you will see that the director and screen writer are one in the same; Semih Kaplanoglu. Is this an issue? It could be. The only other film I know of that was directed and written by the same person was Matewan by John Sayles. But Matewan was an excellent film that the screenwriter took time to perfect. Semih Kaplanoglu, on the other hand, seems to be  a brilliant photographer who was lacking in the ability to craft an excellent screenplay that would hold the viewer's attention.

I think I am being very generous by giving this film a two star rating. If there are some out there who saw Bal and think it was great, please leave your comments because I would give anything to know why this film is so special. I was bored to tears.",1337385600,2,1440,4.338289962825279
8464417,4,B005BXSD2S,"This film compares to ""Le Quattro Volte"" and it's similar story of a life far removed from cities that, incidentally, half the world's population only knows. Both films are spiritual and revolve around the natural lifestyles found in mountainous villages. Both are enigmatic in that both are more visual than verbal and in both films the outcomes for the central characters are left for the viewer to decipher. In Bal, Yusaf, a young boy, additionally has a stuttering problem in which, quite accurately I should say, he partially overcomes by whispering, but unfortunately he lives in a Islamic village and conservative interpretations of the Qur'an regard that as how the evil of Satan speaks to a person. That burden and his isolation at school makes him dependent on his isolated home and in following his father as he wanders the mountainous forests to harvest honey from their hand made hives. Incidentally, I thought the educational setting and how it was conducted to be the most intriguing of all the scenes.
The film needed to have both the characters and scenes be less fragmented especially with Yusaf left hanging at the end. It was hard to give coherence and completion or at least some sense of direction to the story.",1323734400,3,1233,4.904306220095694
8464418,5,B005BXSD2S,"This simple plot turns around an introspective child who finds in his father his best friend - a humble honey collector - he is a very quiet and almost doesn't talk. His behavior really worries his mother who seriously meditates what will be about his future.

Uncapable to read fluent is of the laughingstock of his classmates, his affinity with nature is admirable, specially when we watch him accompanying his father in his daily forays into the forest in search of precious honey.

But then an unexpected event occurs, a fact that will change their lives forever.

This beautiful film has a leisurely pace moments of indescribable beauty, with wild nature as an additional character. A real gem of the Turkish cinema, which is showing strong and growing vitality within the scope of world cinema.

Do not miss it.

P.D.This film won the Berlin Golden Bear for best film in 2010.",1316131200,5,882,4.814569536423841
