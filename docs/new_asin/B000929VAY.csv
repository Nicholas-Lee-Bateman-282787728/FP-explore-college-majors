The lead guy (one of them) is still trying to get in ""good"" with the lady of choice.  The other has major issues going on at home (if you can call it that).  An aunt that is verbally/phsically abusive to him and his younger brother.  She treats them like a couple of pets and sometimes even worse than that.  Making them sit on the floor and not with the rest of the family.  Not allowing them to eat.  I know people suck sometimes but dag this woman has some serious issues going on no question.

I don't want give away anything else though cause you really need to check out this latest/greatest volume of Gantz.  Pretty soon you'll be yelling GANTZ!!

Hopefully you'll enjoy and have fun with this new dark, funny, serious anime.  I gave it a shot and now i'm loving everything that comes my way from it.",1117670400,,964,4.324022346368715
