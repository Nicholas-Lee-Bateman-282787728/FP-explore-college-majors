But, my grandson just became a fireman and I wanted to get him a nice gift, so I purchased this. He sent me a nice note and said that everyone at the firehouse watched them with him and they thought that the way the director captured the fires was very realistic and they then had a discussion about how they would have fought the blazes and learnd from the experience. I can't ask for more than that for a history of fire.",1148428800,,523,4.24
8056274,5,B0008GRFPO,"I could not be happier with this collection. The films come from a the turn of the century up to roughly the end of the 1930s and early 1940s and gave me a decent overall sense of how fires were fought before the advent of modern technical firestop teams.

You can go either way when you think about these films - some seem to be telling a story of brave dudes overcoming heavy odds to stop huge blazes, while other clips are interesting just for the way the director managed to capture the dancing of the flames on film.

The fact that they are filmed in silence adds an eerie quality to the production and it took me several days to get through all of the footage.",1146528000,,666,4.2362204724409445
