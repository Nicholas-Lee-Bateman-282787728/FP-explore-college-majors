I bought it out of curiosity.  It was definitely a ""taste"" of what you can expect from watching the TV series.  I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to get a copy first of all and then, at a reasonable price.  Amazon is the best!  Please note that it is Region 2, so you must have a multi-region dvd player to watch it.",1376006400,,502,4.081632653061225
