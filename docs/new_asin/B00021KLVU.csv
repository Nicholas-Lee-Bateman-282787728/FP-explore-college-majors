2054166,3,B00021KLVU,A simple but amusing little movie that i find enjoyable and wouldn't mind adding to my dvd collection if a dvd version was release. A movie about a girl who is turn into a boy during a eclipse and get the chance to decide which sex she wants to stay when given a chance to change back. One of the funnier gender shifting comedies out there.,1130457600,6,340,4.166666666666667

8019964,5,B00021KLVU,Been looking for this for a while just couldn't remember the name. Very funny movie where a girl named milly makes a wish to be a boy and it comes true. Look for a young Seth green it to me needs to be on blu-Ray like the part when his/her dad is teaching how to fight and cuss of course she meets a group of friends who has bullys after them. I say give it a try,1435795200,,363,3.727272727272727
8019965,5,B00021KLVU,"I loved the movie. Being a comedy I was expecting it to be funny but it was funnier than I expected yet without getting ridiculous.

The movie gets into teenagers' attitudes and perspectives as they view, relate to, and try to understand the opposite sex. The writing and directing were good and the acting by Pamela Adlon was superb. Other than the magical body change the actions of the characters do seem plausible. Pamela did a great job of portraying a teenager trying to fit in as a boy even though raised as a girl. She did a great job making the situation seem believable. (The body change is only spoken of, there is no nudity.)

The attitude and approach of Willy/Milly's parents to the situation also added to the overall humor of the movie.

The DVD case compares this movie to ""Freaky Friday"", ""Big"" and ""Vice Versa"" but that is not really an accurate comparison since these are age switches not sex changes and two are full body switches between two people instead of just one person changing. ""Help! I'M A Boy""  and ""The Hot Chick"" would be a little closer since they do include a sex change along with the body switch, but they are still body switches and not just a change in one body. ""Boys Don't Cry"" would be still closer since it is the story of a hermaphrodite who switched from being a girl to being a boy while in high school, however it is not a comedy it is a tragic drama. ""Just One of the Guys"" is the closest comparison of the movies I have seen since it is about a girl who disguises herself as a boy and enrolls in a new school because she has been the victim of sexual discriminated in her old school. The main difference between the plot of ""Just One of the Guys"" and of ""Something Special"" is that in ""Just One of the Guys"" she is only disguised as a boy while in ""Something Special"" she undergoes a physical change first. Overall I preferred ""Something Special"", it seems more realistic once it gets past the magical change in the main character's body.
One final note, a couple of the reviewers stated that the DVD would not play on their DVD player. PLEASE NOTE: ""ASIN: B002BZZ5SY"" IS A PAL DVD, IT WILL NOT PLAY ON MOST U.S. DVD PLAYERS! Amazon does sale DVD players which will play PAL DVD's.",1422662400,,2231,4.407766990291262

8019967,1,B00021KLVU,This dvd is unplayable- I tried it on 3 different DVD players! I searched for this title everywhere and then waited and waited for it to arrive....all for nothing! What a waste and BIG disappointment.,1383609600,,200,4.742857142857143
8019968,5,B00021KLVU,The VHS quality was better than the DVD.  Great flick! Real Cheesey! I love it! I don't know why this was not released in the USA.  It even has two titles.,1355097600,,155,3.967741935483871
8019969,1,B00021KLVU,"I love this movie, but the DVD did not work.  I even had the DVD player that was recommned to me.  I guess I will continue to watch the VHS.",1355097600,,140,3.6333333333333333
8019970,4,B00021KLVU,"This is one of those little comedies that either captures your attention or loses you. If you allow yourself to play along and don't mind comedy that's cute, clever and fun you'll find Something Special about the movie. Tackling many of the high-school issues that are still relevant today including bullying, gender roles, sexuality and self-identity, Pamela Segall hits the mark with this ""After School"" style flick that's both entertaining and useful in starting dialogues with your own kids.

I decided to write this review to offer an alternative to those folk who are looking for this flick on dvd.  Apparently, due to licensing restrictions of some kind,...""Due to our licensing agreements this video is currently not available for purchase or rental [on DVD]. -- Amazon""

So either you purchase it on Amazon.uk in region 0 PAL (europe format)

Or you can still get this flick in Region 1 NTSC (U.S., Canada format) as part of a bundle. I just purchased:

8019971,3,B00021KLVU,"The DVD I purchased was new ... but the opening credits music was replaces w/ some stupid song!  We LOVE the opening music on the original VHS!  Also, this isn't ""DVD"" quality, sort of looks copied from VHS (a worse copy than the one I already own) - there are occasional ""film"" damage spots in upper right of the video.
Still a must have movie though!",1264896000,4,352,4.318181818181818
8019972,4,B00021KLVU,"I wish this would be put onto DVD. Millie, a teenage girl thinks life as a boy would be easier/better. During an eclipse she performs a ""ceremony"" with materials bought from the neighborhood ""salesman"" (a 10 year old Seth Green) to make her deepest, darkest hearts desire come true. She gets her wish and assumes the identity of Willie, a newcomer to the area. But she soon discovers that life as a teenage boy is no easier than being a girl. She's thrown into awkward teenage situations with babes and bullies, surrounded by her new geeky friends. She must ultimately choose.
It is oh so corny, but I'm a fan.",1190160000,4,610,4.554545454545455
