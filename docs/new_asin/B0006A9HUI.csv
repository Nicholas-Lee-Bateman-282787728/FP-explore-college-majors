2180898,5,B0006A9HUI,"As an observer of art and appreciator of great artists, I found this to be a rare insight into the craft of these two dancers and how they did what they did in terms of their style.  Anyone can dance and learn steps, but it is how these artists work that sets them apart.  They become the characters and we forget they are real people.  They bring us momentarily into this unreal fantasy world which they create so well.  This is what I enjoyed about this performance.  Lynn Seymour is a great dance actress and Nureyev is so intense that there is not a dull moment here.",1139356800,7,571,4.299065420560748
2180899,3,B0006A9HUI,"This GISELLE is certainly enjoyable, and presents two of ballet's greats, but I personally would not toss it up as a first recommendation. The ballet is very cut, in fact the entire DVD clocks in at around seventy minutes. The entire peasant scene is removed from Act One. The production is attractive, but very studio bound, a real 70's video tape ambiance, and a mite cheap looking here and there. I must say I agree with the other reviewers here regarding Seymour - a wonderful dancer caught late in her career in a role physically not terribly congenial to her at this time (she plays Giselle's mother in the trashy-but-fun film DANCERS, shot a few years after this.) There is a wanting of ethereal quality in Act Two. That said, her sincerity is often quite arresting, and she is a fine balletic actress, so this can still be a fun performance if you don't look too hard. I know I will be creamed for this, but I am not terribly fond of Nureyev in this particular outing. The technical skill is of course prodigious, I am less happy with him dramatically here. He does some sardonic faces here and there that border on camp, and for a couple of reasons (some I won't say out loud) he and Seymour aren't the most plausible love couple, even in balletic terms. The Myrtha of Monica Mason is excellent, cold as ice, hard as diamonds, and technically dazzling. A good group of Wilis too, the initial ensemble is taken at a rather rapid clip, and the corps rise to the occasion quite well.

Fans of these particular dancers will want this and should treasure it. For those looking for a good basic GISELLE video, there are other choices that might be more satisfying.",1114905600,21,1667,4.556666666666667
2180900,5,B0006A9HUI,"If someone wanted to know what a classic performance was, this would be a great example.  This performance and presentation are nearly perfect.  The image quality is great and the sound quality is excellent.  The only flaw is that the color intensity is a little weak, which gives it a slight sepia appearance, which is not really a bad thing for a period piece.  The orchestral version used here is a little unusual.  It may be the edition they used.  It has a very clear chamber orchestra quality enhanced by excellent microphone placement and good engineering.
  The peasant pas de deux is actually danced by Seymour and Nureyev, themselves, typically Nureyev.  The choreography he uses for this part is quite interesting.  Nureyev is in classic form here and he looks like he's enjoying himself, as is the rest of this excellent cast( the corps, too!).  Nureyev was a very fine ballet actor and his mime(which includes all non-dance modes of expression) is great here.  In the beginning of the first act he is very amusing in the way he tells his servant not to worry about his little adventure to come.  Because this is in such great condition and a great performance, it is a fine choice for all audiences.",1107216000,15,1212,4.714285714285714
2180901,3,B0006A9HUI,"Having been a true balletomane for the past 45 years, I have, I think, seen many of the greats. Three of them are starring in this studio version of GISELLE.

Nureyev is, well, Rudi. Remember this was 1979 and he was truly at his heights, but I always thought that he was always, well, Rudi. His acting is ALWAYS the same, his (lack of) emotion is ALWAYS the same. Gratefully there's only one rondejambe in the whole piece.

Seymour was one of  the great dramatic ballerinas of all time, but short and had a stocky torso. This killed it for me. Her line was beautiful...but short. She seemed more ""stage-born"" than air borne and was a tad, dare I mention it, long in the toe-shoe for the role.

The best, by far, was Monica Mason as the Queen of the Willis.

What dancing! What drama! What  a face! She is an exquisite woman and I remember her dancing leads in SWAN LAKE as well as ROMEO and JULIET. She made this viewing more than worthwhile.

She joins the ""Myrtha"" pantheon of Toni Lander and the beyond spectacular Martine Van Hamel as one of the greatest Myrta's ever.

For the novice I think this is a lovely introduction to the ballet. It is abridged and the ""friends pas de deux"" is eliminted completely in act one. For the ""maven"" one is better off w/the ABT or Royal versions. Sorry. Jeff",1104105600,12,1298,4.401673640167364

8040970,2,B0006A9HUI,"This DVD gave me the impression that the entire production was for the sole purpose of showing off Nureyev, most likely by Nureyev.  What happened to most of Act I and great hunks of Act II? And the dance of the Willis was incredibly fast, particularly what we used to call the ""bacanall.""  Hurry,hurry, so as to concentrate on Nureyev.  Thank God they didn't do away with Myrtha. No, I would not reccommend this DVD, there are many excellent Giselles out there.",1284595200,3,462,4.609756097560975
8040971,3,B0006A9HUI,"This version of Giselle is a bit of a disappointment because so much dancing was cut from both the first and second acts.  On the positive side, the fact that the performance was filmed in a studio enabled the stage designers to do more with sets and camera angles, to enhance dramatic effect.  The dancers use mime to a greater extent in this performance than in other versions of Giselle currently available on video.  Lynn Seymour is endearing, but her technical capabilities were obviously not equal to the demands of the role (why was she cast instead of a younger dancer?).  Nureyev does not seem to have decided whether to play Albrecht as designing cad or a lovestruck suitor.  His dancing is OK, but if you want to see some of the weaknesses in his technique, this performance will provide the opportunity.  In any case, he also looks too old for the role.  Monica Mason is excellent as Myrtha and the staging of the entrance of the wilis at the beginning of Act II is highly effective.  Be sure to watch one of the longer versions of Giselle, available on DVD, to see the dancing cut from this version.",1271289600,4,1112,4.552763819095477
8040972,4,B0006A9HUI,"I hope you have read all of the above reviews, because they all have good points to consider.

My only objection to the ballet is the length, as it is only 78 minutes. Almost no peasant dances and a condensed 2nd act also, for which there could be NO excuse. That's why we buy ""Giselle"" for goodness sake. I bought this version on Ivy Lin's recommendation, knowing for instance, that Lynn Seymour was a little heavy. In spite of that she played a beautiful Giselle, and I'm sure there are a few heavy weights out there who can identify with her. The only thing she could not do was fly, but her dancing was good, she looked good in her mad scene, and rather than hiding her face in her hands, like some, she acted her part with expression. I felt sympathy for her Giselle. A lot has been said about the fact that Giselle kills herself with Albrecht's sword, and the act of suicide is not how the original version portrayed her death. In all five of my versions, suicide is used. Death from a broken heart would be more heart rending for us, but actresses who could convince us would be hard to find. The only two I've seen who have come close to convincing me is Karen Kain in the Canadian version and Christine Walsh in the Australian Ballet version. I think (correct me if I'm wrong) some Churches forbid burial on so called sacred ground (Church cemetery) when suicide is the cause of death, which is the reason Giselle is buried on unconsecrated ground in the Forest. Even though she didn't commit suicide, the Christine Walsh ""Giselle"" was also buried on unconsecrated ground in a Forest glade. My understanding is, that because of her act of forgiveness, Giselle freed her spirit of wondering the dark  Forests for all eternity with Myrtha and the other Wilis.

Monica Mason IS Myrtha (Meer-ta). She is the best Myrtha of them all. Scary is the word for it. The lighting added to the eerie atmosphere of the night-time Forrest, as everything is back-lit, except for low intensity spotlights on the principles. Some of the white dancing in the 2nd act was abbreviated so much and the music was sped up to the point that if you blinked you are apt to miss the spectacular dance of the Wilis when they hop on one foot in the arabesque. I have never heard that music played so fast in any Giselle. It is so beautiful, why not slow it down instead? Lynn's Giselle shows a tender forgiveness for Albrecht's carelessness in love. I have wondered, however, if the Princess Bathilde, his former fiance, ever forgives him. I have heard that there is a version showing her (Bathilde) coming to reclaim Albrecht. Does anyone know?

This was a film sound stage production, and may not have had a live orchestra. It certainly had no audience. It is claimed to be Dolby 2.0 sound. The video format is 4:3 ratio.

P.S. I now have a sixth version of Giselle by the Australian Ballet, staring Christine Walsh, and Kelvin Coe. I found it on Amazon. UK. I have been looking for another ballet with Christine Walsh for a year, and fortunately found this one, which is very good. The Australian Ballet version is the only version in my collection of six, where Giselle does NOT stab herself with Albrecht's sword. She attempts to, but is prevented by Albrecht. She dies of heart failure, and is quite convincing in her portrayal of a frail young girl with a weak heart, and driven to utter destruction by anxiety and betrayal. Her mad scene is very well done, but the producers foolishly had her in close-up when she picked the Daisey for the ""he loves me, he loves me not"" portion of the mad scene.",1232755200,3,3583,4.531684698608965
