3145486,4,B0015LPRSI,"I don't know....I didn't dislike this film, but I also didn't think a remake was necessary after the Merchant-Ivory version that I thoroughly enjoyed. I thought the acting was fine, but I don't think it was bettter. Also, (im just going to say it) Andrew Davies is way overrated as a screenplay adapter. And as for the huge ending change (that's not in the book)... I didn't really mind it, and it was tragically romantic...but I just don't like adapters taking huge liberties with novels, and it wasn't necessary, and if you are going to take liberties, I just think they should be a little less obvious and easy.
Anyway, all that said....I love PBS and ""Masterpiece"" (though the name change was silly), keep the adaptations coming",1208044800,7,732,4.771653543307087
3145487,1,B0015LPRSI,"I will state upfront that I'm a huge EM Forster fan and the Merchant/Ivory version of this novel is one of my all-time favorites, so when I first heard that Masterpiece Theatre was going to film their own version, I thought: Blasphemy!!!! lol  But I took my chances and just finished watching this version on PBS. Why bother? There may have been a scene or two that you don't see in the Merchant/Ivory version, that is true to the book (the Roman scenes for instance) but this version was what I call a ""why bother"". Nothing new or interesting was added to this version (except the last 15 minutes, which is horrible!). The acting was average at best, the script almost boring and the ending....don't even get me started! Spolier alert (which never happens in the book, or M/I version): Lucy might possibly fall in love with the Italian carriage guide? Please! I'm a romantic at heart, but come on! Another spoiler alert: and George Emerson dying on the battlefields! What? Yes the screenwriter has said that he came across a postscript that Forster wrote 50 years later, but even Andrew Davies has changed that! Leave the novel alone....it's just as perfect as it is! Needless to say, skip this version and go directly to Merchant/Ivory!",1208044800,26,1238,4.731481481481482
3145488,1,B0015LPRSI,"If you're a fan of this great novel, do not watch this adaptation.  The acting was very lack luster and it just didn't capture the feel and the essence of the novel.  There was no wit and so many things were either added or changed.  There was no need for a sex scene when so much about the novel is about repressed sexuality and freedom to make choices.  It did not have to be spelled out for the viewer.  The transformation of Lucy Honeychurch was barely touched upon and I think E.M. Forster's underlying messages were completely lost.

I have no idea what they were thinking when they decided to change the ending. I watched it open mouthed in disbelief. It was unnecessary and I think it totally took away the meaning of the novel.  The ending is supposed to make you feel optimistic and good, despite the obstacles the lovers face.  This ending was depressing and sad.  I think the viewers were cheated.

If you want to watch a better adaptation, watch the 1985 version with Helena Bonham Carter, Julian Sands and Maggie Smith.  No, it's not a perfect adaptation if you want it to be completely true to the book, but it follows the novel much more closely and the casting is wonderful.  Julian Sands, in my opinion, perfectly portrayed George Emerson and Maggie Smith was wonderful as Charlotte Bartlett.  Denholm Elliot was incredibly believable in his touching portrayal of the older Mr. Emerson.

I'm only giving this adaptation one star because it was visually pleasant to watch.  Otherwise I think one star may have been pushing it.",1208044800,45,1543,4.662962962962963
3145489,3,B0015LPRSI,"I have not read the book or watched any other adaptation.  If you have, bear in mind that my review is not based on any comparisons.

This was a light movie with enjoyable scenes scattered throughout, but the overall story seemed very thin.  We are introduced to a Miss Honeychurch early on, who is on vacation.  She meets Mr. Emerson and it seems there is a mutual attraction.  They have maybe two conversations before she leaves.  She meets up with Mr. Vyse, a neighbor who it appears she has been acquainted with for some time.  She and Mr. Vyse become engaged and she appears perfectly happy with the choice.  Then Mr. Emerson moves into the neighborhood (we assume by design) and Miss Honeychurch is immediately flustered and forced to choose between the two men.

The problem with this is that we haven't been given a chance to care about any of these characters.  A movie with a love triangle needs to make the viewer root for someone.  The other characters try by giving their opinions, but we don't know enough about the other characters to know which opinions to trust.  The movie just lacked good characterization all over the place and then ended somewhat muddled and sudden.  But it was not all bad.  There was occasional witty dialogue and pretty scenery.",1208044800,5,1269,4.683257918552036
3145490,2,B0015LPRSI,"Though I don't feel the 1985 theatrical adaptation fully lives up to the expectations I'd built from reading the book, this 2008 version is even more lacking. I do feel Elaine Cassidy looks a bit more realistic as the tepid, muddled Lucy Honeychurch (Bonham-Carter was a bit too ""polished"" for me), but her portrayal of Lucy lacked the subtlety Bonham-Carter did bring to the screen. In fact, none of the actors were able to convey the gentle hints and ironic turns to the plot as seen in the book and the '85 version. I can place the blame heavily on the writing: Davies stripped the plot of its sweet, nuanced and very Austen-like exploration of the maturation of an Edwardian lady for an aggressiveness--both in dialogue and in the characters. Everything is spelled out instead of shown through the characters's actions, and by changing the ending, tweaking characters, as well as injecting a crudely sexual element, Davies basically took the book and adapted it with his own agenda in mind. I'd only recommend this movie if you have a thing for period movies and like watching all sorts of adaptations of your favorite book, whether they be poor or not.",1207872000,27,1157,4.79

3145503,5,B0015LPRSI,"I think Elaine Cassidy is extraordinary in this film.  I saw this version before the earlier version, and perhaps thats one reason I have felt that no other Lucy Honeychurch could ever be as fully engaged -- and engaging -- in this role as Cassidy is.  She has wonderful timing and intricate variety of expression for showing us what a character is feeling.  She looks the part exactly!  Her scene with Timothy Spall (Georges father) in the cottage near the end of the film is mesmerizing, a great duet, one could say, between two actors of genius!  The careful pacing of the director and every detail of speech and demeanor is perfect.  I hope this scene in particular will become known to more and more people who can appreciate its artistry.
 The whole cast is wonderful, and I feel we see three especially powerful performers in Cassidy, Spall, and a magnificently confused Charlotte!  (A woman named Sophie Thompson, I believe; even Maggie Smith is not her equal in this role.)  I feel the early scene in the pension is beautifully composed and full of interest, the humor delicious.
  Im not so sure about the flash forward in the opening of the film, and our glimpse of George lying dead on the battlefield of WW1 casts a pall of sadness over the story which is a wrong move.  Lucys run to the swimming hole is thrilling, but cutting directly to her manic lovemaking with George in the pension is not, perhaps, quite the tender coming together we expected.  (More than a hint, probably, of male fantasy here  in terms of the makers of the film.)
 Considering Cassidys deep impersonation of Miss Honeychurch.
I wish I could see this actor in other serious and artistic
films.  The 2005 mini-series Fingersmith can be seen on YouTube, and that, too, is a remarkable show, full of careful, expressive faces and images somewhat like certain French films of old.  Cassidy personifies the strange and interesting character Maud Lilly to perfection!  She seems to live her characters every step of the way, and so we live them with her -- simply the mark of a great actor, perhaps.
 Im sure shes fine all through the current series The Paradise, but I cant get much involved in so confused a narrative as that.  For those in London Im sure it would be good to see this actress on stage in Turgenev.
 On the whole, Im not sure this is a wonderful world for actors, perhaps especially women actors, in these days of violence in movies, cops and robbers galore, ugly intrigue  as if this is all of human life thats worth portraying.  E. M. Forster knew otherwise, as did Dickens, i. e., and most of our other great writers.  ##",1414800000,3,2624,4.617710583153348

3145507,1,B0015LPRSI,"I saw the Merchant-Ivory version of E.M. Forster's classic chick-lit romance when it first came out in the theatres in 1986, so I was looking forward to watching the 2007 version that aired on Masterpiece Theatre.  Maybe I was spoiled by Merchant-Ivory, but the newer version was so disappointing.  It basically followed the novel, but without the humor, without the charm, without the character development, without the storyline that you get in the 1986 movie.  Maybe it was the writers, maybe it was the actors and casting, and I was particularly disappointed and appalled by the ending.  The ending in this version appears no where in the book, so I'm not sure why the producers/writers/directors thought changing the ending, and in particular to that ending, would be a good idea.  What were they thinking?

Since comparisons with the 1986 Merchant-Ivory movie are inevitable, I'm also disappointed in the actors cast in the later version as well as in the character development and lack of humor.  What makes Forster's novel such a delight is its humor, character development, storyline, and a typical chick-lit love conquers all theme.  I did not get the sense that the characters in the later version connected--unlike Bonham Carter and Sands, you knew they had chemistry, even if she wasn't willing to acknowledge it for some time.  Maybe I've been spoiled by the finer actors in the Merchant-Ivory version, but I liked everyone in that movie much better.  The sense that they were a real family, squabbling with eachother yet you knew that they loved eachother.  The same is true of the relationship between the Emersons.  Merchant-Ivory conveyed the love the Emersons had for eachother, and how much the older Mr Emerson wanted his son to find love and be happy.  I did not get that sense with the 2007 version.

If you're looking for a delightful movie, check out Merchant-Ivory's version, or read the book.  I'm glad that I rented 2007 version from the library instead of buying it.",1398643200,4,1995,4.948948948948949

3145511,4,B0015LPRSI,"The 1986 Merchant/Ivory adaptation of ""A Room with a View"" is one of my favorite movies; I also like the book.

That said, I really enjoyed this adaptation as well, when I saw it originally aired in November 2007 on ITV/Channel 3 in the UK. It's very important to keep in mind that this was made for a general public British TV audience - not for American/International art-house cinema audiences or PBS viewers.

Yes, it's different than ""the original"", but you need to enjoy it for what its is (someone else's interpretation)rather than consider it only in comparison to what many people feel is the definitive version. If you really love a story, there should be some enjoyment in watching different interpretations of that story for the purpose of comparing and contrasting, and seeing it through different eyes - rather than just in the (re-)telling of the story itself. Of course you're bound to prefer some versions to others, but don't write this off because it's not a duplicate of Merchant/Ivory.

I'm really surprised but how upset some reviewers are by this version - it's not that different/off the mark from the book.

If you are dead-set on benchmarking this against the Merchant/Ivory classic, don't bother getting it as you'll be wasting your time and money. If you can watch it with an open mind, you'll enjoy it for what is - and there is some excellent casting and acting.

One last thought - as a piece of (British) primetime television, this is fantastic compared to the usual TV broadcast rubbish (reality shows, un-funny politcally-correct comedies, soap operas, etc.)",1284163200,25,1592,4.903345724907063
3145512,3,B0015LPRSI,"On its own, this is an ok film. Funny, unpredictable, a bit odd, with a rather forced ending. However, after watching the older movie adaptation of E. M. Forster's novel, I appreciate this adaptation more. Not that the other is worse; they both have weaknesses, in different areas. First off, I thought the casting and acting in this version were overall much better, especially the lead - Sophie Thompson did a really great job. Maybe it's me, but Helena Bonham-Carter's acting in the other version felt wooden and was generally unconvincing. The exception is George - I thought George was cast much better in the 1980s adaptation. He has much more character, and seems more like an actual person than a caricature (which is how George Emerson-this-version came across - he's just a little too random).
The other downside of this version: the way the story was told didn't do much for me. The chemistry between George and Lucy is pretty much non-existant, and the tacked-on ending feels clumsy and strained. Where did the scriptwriters get that ending, anyway??
Put briefly, my ideal adaptation would have the cast from this version (except for George) and the storyline/most of the script from the other.",1255046400,,1206,4.945812807881773
3145513,3,B0015LPRSI,"I have no idea why the Brits are making new versions of works by Austen and now Forster and shortening them to one and half hours. It makes you feel like you're watching a Reader's Digest version.

The new adaptation has a very good cast, particularly Timothy and Rafe Spall as Mr. Emerson and his son. I also liked the casting of Elaine Cassidy as Lucy. Cassidy is not as beautiful as Helen Bonham Carter and I found her more believable. I also preferred Rafe Spall to Julian Sands because Spall is less self-conscious as an actor because he doesn't have to worry about his looks so much. In such a short amount of time I believed he was in love with Lucy.

But as another review points out, the storytelling seems rushed and they should have devoted another half hour to characterization. And I really found the new ending unnecessary.

I didn't dislike this version though. It's enjoyable in its own way but if you haven't seen the Merchant Ivory version, you need to immediately.

(I do hope British television stays away from Maurice and Howards End. Those two films are Merchant Ivory at their best, along with The Remains of the Day.)",1249257600,,1141,4.578431372549019
3145514,3,B0015LPRSI,"This isn't a bad movie in and of itself.  It's an interesting story, but it's not ""A Room with a View"".

Whether or not you think the Merchant Ivory version was too pretty or too uppity, is irrelevant.  The M/I version was the real story.  It was faithfully adpated from the book, almost to the last word written by Forster.  It was ""A Room with a View"" - no question.

This version of ARWAV is really just loosely based on the book.  Yes, there are some story parallels, but that's about it.  This movie tries too hard to inject 21st century sexual sensibilities into it.  Much of what is implicit in the book and the M/I version has to be spelled out in this movie just because of the belief that today's viewers want more sex.  Lucy didn't have to tell Cecil in the book or the M/I movie that when she used to bathe at the ""Sacred Lake"" that she had ""nothing on"".  That sort of thing was implicit.  While Lucy's sexual liberation is a main theme of the story, I highly doubt a woman of her time and social status would have run into the pond and embraced a naked man (or spoken to a man in the hallway while he was dressed in just a towel).  The ending was almost ridiculous and totally unnecessary.  It truly made the book into a different story.

For the most part, I found the characters very undeveloped.  Mr. Beebe, so likeable in the book and the M/I film, is underused and stiff. Charlotte's overprotectiveness and prissiness never really comes through.  George, so broody, shy and quiet in the original story, comes off as such a goofball it's hard to understand Lucy's attraction to him.

I sort of like how they interpreted Cecil though.  I love Daniel Day Lewis, but his portrayal of Cecil in the M/I version was almost a caricature.  This Cecil seems a little less like a cartoon, although manages to be just as unlikeable.  However, I was really irked that the movie left out a major plot point.  The Emersons just magically appear in the neighborhood in this version.  We never learn about Cecil's fiendish plot to bring them there.  I think that is such a major insight into his character and I don't know why this script left it out.

If you want to watch this movie because you want to see an interesting love story, feel free to watch.  If you want to watch this movie because you love ""A Room with a View"", skip it.",1247097600,8,2337,4.376744186046512
3145515,4,B0015LPRSI,"I thought this was a good adaptation of the book.  Most of the actors did a fine job with their roles and the couple of exceptions weren't enough to bring it down for me.  I was happy to see that in this version they left in the film a bit of George's sensuality that would have shocked Lucy and her peers of the period.  My only real disappointment, but it was a major one, was the added ending.  This wasn't an alternate ending, just a several minute epilogue that to me doesn't seem related to E.M. Forster's message or intent.",1242000000,,530,4.27
3145516,3,B0015LPRSI,"When one has a Merchant-Ivory production to compare oneself to, one has to be extra careful and quite apparently the authors of the movie failed to remember about this warning. They were apparently aware of the existence of the earlier version and tried to do their best to do something different. And they failed. Partly because they tried at the same time to do something different from the book.
The moments of the movie which are good are not very different from the 1986 version. Well, there is not much one can do with Florence but I guess there is something one could do to make the Florentine part not look as if some scenes were exactly reshot with a different cast.
There are parts of the new movie which are different - we get a Roman bit (not really included in the novel...) which is nice and colourful (in general, this version is much more subdued than the 1986 one) but it only presents Cecil in a completely wrong light. When he can't kiss Lucy we can't help but wonder (even though the script includes a bit too many allusions to his homosexuality ;) why it is so difficult for him.
And then there is the whole structure of the movie. The book (and Merchant/Ivory movie) is set within a time frame of the year. Lucy and Charlotte arrive in Florence in the spring, the English part takes place in the summer, the conflict coincides with the arrival of the autumn, and Lucy is back in Florence in the early spring with George. You don't believe me? Well, don't take my word for it. Read the book!
This modest time frame was apparently not enough for producers - they had to add to the novel another time frame and make Lucy revist Italy in 1922, some years after George... was killed in the Great War. Which only proves that getting a decent critical edition can be crucial to success - George could not get killed in the war because he was a consciencious objector and did time for that. He did fight, however, in the Second World War. Anyone who read the book knows this from Forster's postscript written in 1958.
The movie ends with Lucy reunited with the Italian coachman. If all her liberation was aimed at this, well, did she really have to wait for some twenty years? It seems the more a waste of time as Lucy of 2007 version is by far more liberated than she was twenty years earlier. This makes the movie more modern but undermines the crucial issue of the plot - spiritual maturation and liberation.
In short - a lavish TV production. Not very bad but it doesn't measure up to the 1986 version.",1238803200,6,2520,4.444924406047516

3145518,2,B0015LPRSI,"After having adapted so many great Victorian novels for the BBC successfully, Andrew Davies tried to set the bar for himself even higher by adapting this E. M. Forster novel which most people would think had been definitively adapted as a film in 1986 by Merchant/Ivory. To give Davies credit, he does work to make this adaptation as different as possible, so he intriguingly plays up the class difference between Lucy Honeychurch and her suitor George Emerson (an element all but ignored in the Merchant-Ivory film) and also elects to have her other suitor, Cecil Vyse, more of a Bloomsbury type than he was in Daniel Day-Lewis's indelible broad caricature of the role from twenty-some years ago. All this seems potentially quite interesting; but Davies--disastrously--chose to make this version much grimmer than the 1986 film. All of the more comic elements of the original novel are drained away so completely that you'd think this were an adaptation of George Moore rather than of one of Forster's funniest novel. The cinematographer's palette here is murky and unlovely, and there's even a grossly unneeded framing device involving George Emerson's death in the trenches of the war and Lucy's return visit to Florence in the 20s that seem pompous and unwieldy. All the actors, even the excellent Sophie Thompson, seem suitably depressed and unhappy; this is really an experiment that failed.",1234137600,16,1397,5.131578947368421

I have never seen the Merchant/Ivory production either. And so I decided to watch the Andrew Davies version to see if I had been missing anything. Not knowing  the story, the opening sequences were quite confusing, and the production as a whole took a long time to get going, so much so that part way through I almost gave up. But perserverance won through, and I found myself enjoying the story at the end, not knowing at that stage that the bedroom and final scenes are the additions of the producer. One can understand the pathos and sense of loneliness when Lucy returned to the place where she and the young Mr Emerson had taken their first kiss, but there was the underlying assumption that perhaps Lucy, now a widow, was going to take up with the Italian who had driven their carriage to the fields 10 years previously! It all seemed out of place somehow, and didn't ring true.

3145524,3,B0015LPRSI,"I didn't hate this version of Room With a View.  Yes, I have seen the Merchant Ivory version.  Yes, I have read the book. Although I thought the cast of the Merchant Ivory production was magnificent, I actually like a great deal of the cast in this adaptation as well, so I was prepared to view this with an open mind and not hate it instantly because it wasn't Merchant Ivory.  I have seen several of this cast (Cassidy, Cusak, Thompson, Spall) in other productions and thought they were wonderful.  The aspects of this production I found most disappointing were the script and direction.  I found the dialogue to be lackluster, and the interpretation of some of the characters (primarily Cecil) just plain dull.  I have admired some of Davies' adaptations in the past, but his more recent works seem to have an underlying conceit in them that I find distasteful, as though he would deign to ""improve"" the works of the authors he is adapting.  Davies is, indeed a gifted and talented man, but is he really so lofty that he feels capable of enhancing Austen, Forster, and Waugh?  He had a wonderful cast of people to work with for this adaptation, but their performances were never going to reach the stellar level they were capable of when the script they were given to work with was second rate.  I know there was a time limitation, but the story was just diluted and unnecessary additions were made (the additional meeting with the gig driver, George's death, etc)that seemed to serve no purpose other than to needlessly outrage the audience.  I don't understand why Davies feels the need to shock a response out of his audience, rather than impress them with quality.  That cheapens the whole production.

What a relief to finally see a film adaptation of ""Room With A View"" which is not seen through rose colored glasses  and dripping in gossamer. Every M/I film has the same prettified, romanticized, Hollywoodized take on period pieces. The Andrew Davies version is both much closer to the book in spirit than the M/I version and yet shakes it up in a way that beautifully brings all the social, historical and sexual issues into play. The actors look and behave like real people with real dimension instead of character archtypes as in the M/I version. Casting the father and son team of Timothy and Rafe Spall is a stroke of genius. Elaine Cassidy's take on  Lucy's inner turmoil and longing is spot on and all the supporting roles are seamless. All this fuss and moaning about the endng is really a tempest in a teacup. The ending is startling, yet innovative, provocative and is based on Forster's own musings. It does exactly what a film adaption should do - adapt!

Not only are the characters somewhat unbelievable (the acting isn't exactly terrible, the writing just seems a bit dodgy), but it turned one of my favorite ""Yes! Life is to be lived!"" stories into something utterly depressing.

The plot only roughly keeps to Forster's original, the characters are far from being similar and the ending was absolutely terrible.

3145528,2,B0015LPRSI,"I gave this production 2 stars because the overall production quality and acting was fair enough. On the other hand... I had doubts about this remake from the beginning- it's always dangerous to remake something done so well once. Some (on this site) found the 1985 version stuffy and too romantic, but that's the whole point. The juxtoposition of fantastically sensual scenery against turn of the century English stuffiness was explosive and revealed Lucy's conflict as well as her passionate piano playing. This version suffers from a lack of chemistry between its stars. I'm really not sure if I would have realized there was any attraction between them at all without previous knowledge of the story. So, the supporting cast could not provide the magic of the Merchant/Ivory version and the leads had no chemistry, but it was better than I feared it would be all around---UNTIL the end. The end was awful- it completely gutted the author's intent. SPOILERS!!!
Forster did not even leave George's fate up to question- he put him back in Florence after WWI and states specifically that he was a conscientious objector- fully in line with his RWAV characterization. Lucy's tracking down of the gig driver was just tacky and suggests that George was not the catalyst of her sexual awakening, but a place holder. Awful. These were carefully built characters who were gutted in the last minutes of this adaption.
Lastly, the only real excuse to remake this film would be to do it as Forster privately imagined it- as a tale of two men- it would be neither difficult nor terribly shocking today. That would be interesting. This was not and appalled at the end.",1208304000,6,1657,4.879432624113475

But that mournful note is felt throughout the movie as the tragic music keeps playing in the background, which was awkward when immediately following the funny scenes.  Equally out of place was the altered timeline, with the values and dress belonging to a different decade.  The acting was also disappointingly lackluster, and the production was so wrapped up in being a new ""Room"" that the spirit and cleverness of Forster were sadly missing.

Film scripts are not novels, please note:  they should be a reflection of the filmmaker's view of the essence of the source.  The intuitively clever casting of Timothy and Rafe Spall as the Emersons pere et fils added great authenticity to their depiction of a warm filial relationship.  And the real-life sensuousness and adult vitality of this version, and this Lucy, triumphed over the overstuffed Merchant Ivory film -- with that buxom little pixie Bonham Carter looking much too young to have an adult relationship with either of the men in her scope.  The fact that Andrew Davies did his homework and found Forster's late-in-life ruminations on what might have happened to Lucy and George after their marriage, is delineated in his beautiful coda to the film; and the creation of the long shot of the gorgeous dying light over the Arno transitioning to the light of death over the World War I battlefield is a stroke of cinematic genius. As for the viewers who wish for a happy ending -- Lucy and George lived on the brink of the most disastrous years of the war-torn 20th century, and what happened to them reflects the truth of the history of England's tragedy and triumph in those years. (Remember: Forster thought this film's coda would be a likely conclusion to his tale, too.)

The scene where Cecil is reading the barely-fictionalized account of Lucy and George's kiss, in front of her whole family and George, was emotional torture, and perfectly acted.

3145533,5,B0015LPRSI,"Disclaimer: I'm a guy, and my wife made me watch this. I hadn't read the book or seen the Merchant of Venice or Ivory Soap versions before, so I wasn't ""tainted."" On top of that, I hate period-pieces, can't stand costumes, and would rather eat glass than read Jane Oyster, or whatever her name is.

Now that that's out of the way, this was a pretty cool movie. It didn't have any of the typical smarmy way of mixing the lugubrious with the slick. The acting was very good (I loved that rat-guy from ""Harry Potter""); the photography excellent but not overwhelming, as was the scenery; and I barely noticed the costumes (so they must have been done well).

Elaine Cassidy and the actor who played George Emerson, who's name I've unfortunately forgotten (no YOU google it!) were surprisingly and wonderfully believable, even for a dyspeptic skeptic like myself. I'm looking forward to seeing more of them in the future.

I particularly appreciated the segue to the battlefield. As E.M. Forster didn't exactly fit the Rambo-mold, I had feared that this was going to be another chick-flick that was going to make some point about the gore and uselessness of war, yadda-yadda-yadda. But the scene was great! Unremarkable place, anonymous shelling, dead body, no pithy and lugubrious final words. I like that they kept the romance in the romance, and out of the trenches. I don't know if that was Forster's foresight, or that of the producers, but good job all-round!

A guy could watch this kind of film and not want to heave, and that earns my respect. Even an American guy. (You know, the kind that doesn't appreciate literature, and doesn't get sarcasm.)

P.S. If you don't like what a movie does to a book, read the book and leave the movie alone. (You don't see me going to Tolkien adaptations, do you?) Apple ; orange. Orange ; apple.

Rafe Spall is an improvement over Julian Sands, so I was very disappointed by Andrew Davies' tacked on and very unnecessary ""twist"" at the end.  Since the book was written in 1908, there certainly was never anything about WWI.  The less-than-90-minute time frame is just too short to really do justice to these classics that PBS is redoing.

I especially enjoyed the lead actress...she brought a vigor and innocence and rich expressiveness to the role. Unlike Sands, the young actor who played George Emerson has an appealing earthiness and his grin showed joy. The cinematography was also lovely --- oh my, the scenery! --- those shot-from-below views of the Florentine statuary were seductive and fascinating. The lovemaking scene near the end that some prudish reviewers object to was gorgeous, the rumpled white sheets, the way the light came in.

3145540,3,B0015LPRSI,"2008's A Room With A View"" is a Masterpiece Theater dramatization of E.M. Forster's novel of the same name, adapted for the screen by veteran writer Andrew Davies (Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility). The film is produced to the usual quality PBS standards but the adaptation may represent a case of overreaching.

The story concerns a young and proper Englishwoman named Lucy, who visits Italy with her spinster chaperone Charlotte in the years prior to the First World War. Upon arrival at a pensione, Lucy and Charlotte find their assigned room lacks a promised view. A Mr. Emerson and his son George obligingly switch accomodations so that Lucy gets her view. In touring nearby Florence, Lucy gets to know Mr. Emerson and George, who are, shockingly, amiable but freethinking socialists and atheists. When Lucy witnesses a street murder, it is George who rescues her. On a subsequent visit to the beautiful Italian countryside, George surprises Lucy by kissing her. Lucy's shocked chaperone rushes her off to Rome to stay with a neighbor from England, a Mr. Vyse. Lucy and Mr. Vyse become engaged and return to England. The engagement falls apart when George appears in Lucy's village, forcing her to confront her lack of real passion for Mr. Vyse.

The movie features nicely romantic location shooting in Italy and England. Elaine Cassidy is very acceptable as the young Englishwoman struggling to deal with the conflict between her feelings and her expectations. The supporting cast provides good context for Lucy's dilemma as the touring party in Italy and her family in England. This reviewer wishes they had been given more screen time.

Being in love is by definition an irrational state; romantic comedy is mostly for the spectators as we watch people in love go through awkward self-discovery. The process is acceptable as entertainment because, at least in fiction, we expect happy endings. Andrew Davies has been remarkably successful in refreshing Jane Austen's novels for a modern audience, by bringing out points of interest for the modern viewer without damaging the author's original intent. In this case, he may have been less successful. Lucy's sexual awakening is unsubtle. Davies' new ending is, in its first part, a real downer, and in the second, rather implausible. This reviewer was disappointed.

""A Room With A View"" is worth a look as a different take on a familiar story. Viewers may form their own opinions on whether it is an improvement or not.",1208131200,,2486,5.056097560975609

Why bother? There may have been a scene or two that you don't see in the Merchant/Ivory version, that is true to the book (the Roman scenes for instance) but this version was what I call a ""why bother"".

3379985,1,B0015LPRSI,"If you're a fan of this great novel, do not watch this adaptation.  The acting was very lack luster and it just didn't capture the feel and the essence of the novel.  There was no wit and so many things were either added or changed.  There was no need for a sex scene when so much about the novel is about repressed sexuality and freedom to make choices.  It did not have to be spelled out for the viewer.  The transformation of Lucy Honeychurch was barely touched upon and I think E.M. Forster's underlying messages were completely lost.

I have no idea what they were thinking when they decided to change the ending. I watched it open mouthed in disbelief. It was unnecessary and I think it totally took away the meaning of the novel.  The ending is supposed to make you feel optimistic and good, despite the obstacles the lovers face.  This ending was depressing and sad.  I think the viewers were cheated.

If you want to watch a better adaptation, watch the 1985 version with Helena Bonham Carter, Julian Sands and Maggie Smith.  No, it's not a perfect adaptation if you want it to be completely true to the book, but it follows the novel much more closely and the casting is wonderful.  Julian Sands, in my opinion, perfectly portrayed George Emerson and Maggie Smith was wonderful as Charlotte Bartlett.  Denholm Elliot was incredibly believable in his touching portrayal of the older Mr. Emerson.

3379986,3,B0015LPRSI,"I have not read the book or watched any other adaptation.  If you have, bear in mind that my review is not based on any comparisons.

This was a light movie with enjoyable scenes scattered throughout, but the overall story seemed very thin.  We are introduced to a Miss Honeychurch early on, who is on vacation.  She meets Mr. Emerson and it seems there is a mutual attraction.  They have maybe two conversations before she leaves.  She meets up with Mr. Vyse, a neighbor who it appears she has been acquainted with for some time.  She and Mr. Vyse become engaged and she appears perfectly happy with the choice.  Then Mr. Emerson moves into the neighborhood (we assume by design) and Miss Honeychurch is immediately flustered and forced to choose between the two men.

The problem with this is that we haven't been given a chance to care about any of these characters.  A movie with a love triangle needs to make the viewer root for someone.  The other characters try by giving their opinions, but we don't know enough about the other characters to know which opinions to trust.  The movie just lacked good characterization all over the place and then ended somewhat muddled and sudden.  But it was not all bad.

I do feel Elaine Cassidy looks a bit more realistic as the tepid, muddled Lucy Honeychurch (Bonham-Carter was a bit too ""polished"" for me), but her portrayal of Lucy lacked the subtlety Bonham-Carter did bring to the screen. In fact, none of the actors were able to convey the gentle hints and ironic turns to the plot as seen in the book and the '85 version. I can place the blame heavily on the writing: Davies stripped the plot of its sweet, nuanced and very Austen-like exploration of the maturation of an Edwardian lady for an aggressiveness--both in dialogue and in the characters. Everything is spelled out instead of shown through the characters's actions, and by changing the ending, tweaking characters, as well as injecting a crudely sexual element, Davies basically took the book and adapted it with his own agenda in mind.

I saw this version before the earlier version, and perhaps thats one reason I have felt that no other Lucy Honeychurch could ever be as fully engaged -- and engaging -- in this role as Cassidy is.  She has wonderful timing and intricate variety of expression for showing us what a character is feeling.  She looks the part exactly!  Her scene with Timothy Spall (Georges father) in the cottage near the end of the film is mesmerizing, a great duet, one could say, between two actors of genius!  The careful pacing of the director and every detail of speech and demeanor is perfect.  I hope this scene in particular will become known to more and more people who can appreciate its artistry.
 The whole cast is wonderful, and I feel we see three especially powerful performers in Cassidy, Spall, and a magnificently confused Charlotte!  (A woman named Sophie Thompson, I believe; even Maggie Smith is not her equal in this role.)  I feel the early scene in the pension is beautifully composed and full of interest, the humor delicious.
  Im not so sure about the flash forward in the opening of the film, and our glimpse of George lying dead on the battlefield of WW1 casts a pall of sadness over the story which is a wrong move.  Lucys run to the swimming hole is thrilling, but cutting directly to her manic lovemaking with George in the pension is not, perhaps, quite the tender coming together we expected.  (More than a hint, probably, of male fantasy here  in terms of the makers of the film.)
 Considering Cassidys deep impersonation of Miss Honeychurch.
I wish I could see this actor in other serious and artistic
films.  The 2005 mini-series Fingersmith can be seen on YouTube, and that, too, is a remarkable show, full of careful, expressive faces and images somewhat like certain French films of old.  Cassidy personifies the strange and interesting character Maud Lilly to perfection!  She seems to live her characters every step of the way, and so we live them with her -- simply the mark of a great actor, perhaps.
 Im sure shes fine all through the current series The Paradise, but I cant get much involved in so confused a narrative as that.  For those in London Im sure it would be good to see this actress on stage in Turgenev.
 On the whole, Im not sure this is a wonderful world for actors, perhaps especially women actors, in these days of violence in movies, cops and robbers galore, ugly intrigue  as if this is all of human life thats worth portraying.  E. M. Forster knew otherwise, as did Dickens, i. e., and most of our other great writers.  ##",1414800000,3,2624,4.617710583153348

Forster's classic chick-lit romance when it first came out in the theatres in 1986, so I was looking forward to watching the 2007 version that aired on Masterpiece Theatre.  Maybe I was spoiled by Merchant-Ivory, but the newer version was so disappointing.  It basically followed the novel, but without the humor, without the charm, without the character development, without the storyline that you get in the 1986 movie.  Maybe it was the writers, maybe it was the actors and casting, and I was particularly disappointed and appalled by the ending.  The ending in this version appears no where in the book, so I'm not sure why the producers/writers/directors thought changing the ending, and in particular to that ending, would be a good idea.  What were they thinking?

Since comparisons with the 1986 Merchant-Ivory movie are inevitable, I'm also disappointed in the actors cast in the later version as well as in the character development and lack of humor.  What makes Forster's novel such a delight is its humor, character development, storyline, and a typical chick-lit love conquers all theme.  I did not get the sense that the characters in the later version connected--unlike Bonham Carter and Sands, you knew they had chemistry, even if she wasn't willing to acknowledge it for some time.  Maybe I've been spoiled by the finer actors in the Merchant-Ivory version, but I liked everyone in that movie much better.  The sense that they were a real family, squabbling with eachother yet you knew that they loved eachother.  The same is true of the relationship between the Emersons.  Merchant-Ivory conveyed the love the Emersons had for eachother, and how much the older Mr Emerson wanted his son to find love and be happy.  I did not get that sense with the 2007 version.

Yes, it's different than ""the original"", but you need to enjoy it for what its is (someone else's interpretation)rather than consider it only in comparison to what many people feel is the definitive version. If you really love a story, there should be some enjoyment in watching different interpretations of that story for the purpose of comparing and contrasting, and seeing it through different eyes - rather than just in the (re-)telling of the story itself. Of course you're bound to prefer some versions to others, but don't write this off because it's not a duplicate of Merchant/Ivory.

I'm really surprised but how upset some reviewers are by this version - it's not that different/off the mark from the book.

If you are dead-set on benchmarking this against the Merchant/Ivory classic, don't bother getting it as you'll be wasting your time and money. If you can watch it with an open mind, you'll enjoy it for what is - and there is some excellent casting and acting.

One last thought - as a piece of (British) primetime television, this is fantastic compared to the usual TV broadcast rubbish (reality shows, un-funny politcally-correct comedies, soap operas, etc.)",1284163200,25,1592,4.903345724907063
3380009,3,B0015LPRSI,"On its own, this is an ok film. Funny, unpredictable, a bit odd, with a rather forced ending. However, after watching the older movie adaptation of E. M. Forster's novel, I appreciate this adaptation more. Not that the other is worse; they both have weaknesses, in different areas. First off, I thought the casting and acting in this version were overall much better, especially the lead - Sophie Thompson did a really great job. Maybe it's me, but Helena Bonham-Carter's acting in the other version felt wooden and was generally unconvincing. The exception is George - I thought George was cast much better in the 1980s adaptation. He has much more character, and seems more like an actual person than a caricature (which is how George Emerson-this-version came across - he's just a little too random).
The other downside of this version: the way the story was told didn't do much for me. The chemistry between George and Lucy is pretty much non-existant, and the tacked-on ending feels clumsy and strained. Where did the scriptwriters get that ending, anyway??
Put briefly, my ideal adaptation would have the cast from this version (except for George) and the storyline/most of the script from the other.",1255046400,,1206,4.945812807881773
3380010,3,B0015LPRSI,"I have no idea why the Brits are making new versions of works by Austen and now Forster and shortening them to one and half hours. It makes you feel like you're watching a Reader's Digest version.

The new adaptation has a very good cast, particularly Timothy and Rafe Spall as Mr. Emerson and his son. I also liked the casting of Elaine Cassidy as Lucy. Cassidy is not as beautiful as Helen Bonham Carter and I found her more believable. I also preferred Rafe Spall to Julian Sands because Spall is less self-conscious as an actor because he doesn't have to worry about his looks so much. In such a short amount of time I believed he was in love with Lucy.

But as another review points out, the storytelling seems rushed and they should have devoted another half hour to characterization. And I really found the new ending unnecessary.

I didn't dislike this version though. It's enjoyable in its own way but if you haven't seen the Merchant Ivory version, you need to immediately.

(I do hope British television stays away from Maurice and Howards End. Those two films are Merchant Ivory at their best, along with The Remains of the Day.)",1249257600,,1141,4.578431372549019
3380011,3,B0015LPRSI,"This isn't a bad movie in and of itself.  It's an interesting story, but it's not ""A Room with a View"".

Whether or not you think the Merchant Ivory version was too pretty or too uppity, is irrelevant.  The M/I version was the real story.  It was faithfully adpated from the book, almost to the last word written by Forster.  It was ""A Room with a View"" - no question.

This version of ARWAV is really just loosely based on the book.  Yes, there are some story parallels, but that's about it.  This movie tries too hard to inject 21st century sexual sensibilities into it.  Much of what is implicit in the book and the M/I version has to be spelled out in this movie just because of the belief that today's viewers want more sex.  Lucy didn't have to tell Cecil in the book or the M/I movie that when she used to bathe at the ""Sacred Lake"" that she had ""nothing on"".  That sort of thing was implicit.  While Lucy's sexual liberation is a main theme of the story, I highly doubt a woman of her time and social status would have run into the pond and embraced a naked man (or spoken to a man in the hallway while he was dressed in just a towel).  The ending was almost ridiculous and totally unnecessary.  It truly made the book into a different story.

For the most part, I found the characters very undeveloped.  Mr. Beebe, so likeable in the book and the M/I film, is underused and stiff. Charlotte's overprotectiveness and prissiness never really comes through.  George, so broody, shy and quiet in the original story, comes off as such a goofball it's hard to understand Lucy's attraction to him.

I sort of like how they interpreted Cecil though.  I love Daniel Day Lewis, but his portrayal of Cecil in the M/I version was almost a caricature.  This Cecil seems a little less like a cartoon, although manages to be just as unlikeable.  However, I was really irked that the movie left out a major plot point.  The Emersons just magically appear in the neighborhood in this version.  We never learn about Cecil's fiendish plot to bring them there.  I think that is such a major insight into his character and I don't know why this script left it out.

If you want to watch this movie because you want to see an interesting love story, feel free to watch.  If you want to watch this movie because you love ""A Room with a View"", skip it.",1247097600,8,2337,4.376744186046512

I was happy to see that in this version they left in the film a bit of George's sensuality that would have shocked Lucy and her peers of the period.  My only real disappointment, but it was a major one, was the added ending.  This wasn't an alternate ending, just a several minute epilogue that to me doesn't seem related to E.M. Forster's message or intent.",1242000000,,530,4.27
3380013,3,B0015LPRSI,"When one has a Merchant-Ivory production to compare oneself to, one has to be extra careful and quite apparently the authors of the movie failed to remember about this warning. They were apparently aware of the existence of the earlier version and tried to do their best to do something different. And they failed. Partly because they tried at the same time to do something different from the book.
The moments of the movie which are good are not very different from the 1986 version. Well, there is not much one can do with Florence but I guess there is something one could do to make the Florentine part not look as if some scenes were exactly reshot with a different cast.
There are parts of the new movie which are different - we get a Roman bit (not really included in the novel...) which is nice and colourful (in general, this version is much more subdued than the 1986 one) but it only presents Cecil in a completely wrong light. When he can't kiss Lucy we can't help but wonder (even though the script includes a bit too many allusions to his homosexuality ;) why it is so difficult for him.
And then there is the whole structure of the movie. The book (and Merchant/Ivory movie) is set within a time frame of the year. Lucy and Charlotte arrive in Florence in the spring, the English part takes place in the summer, the conflict coincides with the arrival of the autumn, and Lucy is back in Florence in the early spring with George. You don't believe me? Well, don't take my word for it. Read the book!
This modest time frame was apparently not enough for producers - they had to add to the novel another time frame and make Lucy revist Italy in 1922, some years after George... was killed in the Great War. Which only proves that getting a decent critical edition can be crucial to success - George could not get killed in the war because he was a consciencious objector and did time for that. He did fight, however, in the Second World War. Anyone who read the book knows this from Forster's postscript written in 1958.
The movie ends with Lucy reunited with the Italian coachman. If all her liberation was aimed at this, well, did she really have to wait for some twenty years? It seems the more a waste of time as Lucy of 2007 version is by far more liberated than she was twenty years earlier. This makes the movie more modern but undermines the crucial issue of the plot - spiritual maturation and liberation.
In short - a lavish TV production. Not very bad but it doesn't measure up to the 1986 version.",1238803200,6,2520,4.444924406047516

3380015,2,B0015LPRSI,"After having adapted so many great Victorian novels for the BBC successfully, Andrew Davies tried to set the bar for himself even higher by adapting this E. M. Forster novel which most people would think had been definitively adapted as a film in 1986 by Merchant/Ivory. To give Davies credit, he does work to make this adaptation as different as possible, so he intriguingly plays up the class difference between Lucy Honeychurch and her suitor George Emerson (an element all but ignored in the Merchant-Ivory film) and also elects to have her other suitor, Cecil Vyse, more of a Bloomsbury type than he was in Daniel Day-Lewis's indelible broad caricature of the role from twenty-some years ago. All this seems potentially quite interesting; but Davies--disastrously--chose to make this version much grimmer than the 1986 film. All of the more comic elements of the original novel are drained away so completely that you'd think this were an adaptation of George Moore rather than of one of Forster's funniest novel. The cinematographer's palette here is murky and unlovely, and there's even a grossly unneeded framing device involving George Emerson's death in the trenches of the war and Lucy's return visit to Florence in the 20s that seem pompous and unwieldy.

I have never seen the Merchant/Ivory production either. And so I decided to watch the Andrew Davies version to see if I had been missing anything. Not knowing  the story, the opening sequences were quite confusing, and the production as a whole took a long time to get going, so much so that part way through I almost gave up. But perserverance won through, and I found myself enjoying the story at the end, not knowing at that stage that the bedroom and final scenes are the additions of the producer. One can understand the pathos and sense of loneliness when Lucy returned to the place where she and the young Mr Emerson had taken their first kiss, but there was the underlying assumption that perhaps Lucy, now a widow, was going to take up with the Italian who had driven their carriage to the fields 10 years previously! It all seemed out of place somehow, and didn't ring true.

I have seen several of this cast (Cassidy, Cusak, Thompson, Spall) in other productions and thought they were wonderful.  The aspects of this production I found most disappointing were the script and direction.  I found the dialogue to be lackluster, and the interpretation of some of the characters (primarily Cecil) just plain dull.  I have admired some of Davies' adaptations in the past, but his more recent works seem to have an underlying conceit in them that I find distasteful, as though he would deign to ""improve"" the works of the authors he is adapting.  Davies is, indeed a gifted and talented man, but is he really so lofty that he feels capable of enhancing Austen, Forster, and Waugh?  He had a wonderful cast of people to work with for this adaptation, but their performances were never going to reach the stellar level they were capable of when the script they were given to work with was second rate.  I know there was a time limitation, but the story was just diluted and unnecessary additions were made (the additional meeting with the gig driver, George's death, etc)that seemed to serve no purpose other than to needlessly outrage the audience.

Every M/I film has the same prettified, romanticized, Hollywoodized take on period pieces.

I had doubts about this remake from the beginning- it's always dangerous to remake something done so well once. Some (on this site) found the 1985 version stuffy and too romantic, but that's the whole point. The juxtoposition of fantastically sensual scenery against turn of the century English stuffiness was explosive and revealed Lucy's conflict as well as her passionate piano playing. This version suffers from a lack of chemistry between its stars. I'm really not sure if I would have realized there was any attraction between them at all without previous knowledge of the story. So, the supporting cast could not provide the magic of the Merchant/Ivory version and the leads had no chemistry, but it was better than I feared it would be all around---UNTIL the end. The end was awful- it completely gutted the author's intent. SPOILERS!!!
Forster did not even leave George's fate up to question- he put him back in Florence after WWI and states specifically that he was a conscientious objector- fully in line with his RWAV characterization. Lucy's tracking down of the gig driver was just tacky and suggests that George was not the catalyst of her sexual awakening, but a place holder. Awful. These were carefully built characters who were gutted in the last minutes of this adaption.
Lastly, the only real excuse to remake this film would be to do it as Forster privately imagined it- as a tale of two men- it would be neither difficult nor terribly shocking today. That would be interesting. This was not and appalled at the end.",1208304000,6,1657,4.879432624113475

Film scripts are not novels, please note:  they should be a reflection of the filmmaker's view of the essence of the source.  The intuitively clever casting of Timothy and Rafe Spall as the Emersons pere et fils added great authenticity to their depiction of a warm filial relationship.  And the real-life sensuousness and adult vitality of this version, and this Lucy, triumphed over the overstuffed Merchant Ivory film -- with that buxom little pixie Bonham Carter looking much too young to have an adult relationship with either of the men in her scope.  The fact that Andrew Davies did his homework and found Forster's late-in-life ruminations on what might have happened to Lucy and George after their marriage, is delineated in his beautiful coda to the film; and the creation of the long shot of the gorgeous dying light over the Arno transitioning to the light of death over the World War I battlefield is a stroke of cinematic genius. As for the viewers who wish for a happy ending -- Lucy and George lived on the brink of the most disastrous years of the war-torn 20th century, and what happened to them reflects the truth of the history of England's tragedy and triumph in those years.

On top of that, I hate period-pieces, can't stand costumes, and would rather eat glass than read Jane Oyster, or whatever her name is.

Now that that's out of the way, this was a pretty cool movie. It didn't have any of the typical smarmy way of mixing the lugubrious with the slick. The acting was very good (I loved that rat-guy from ""Harry Potter""); the photography excellent but not overwhelming, as was the scenery; and I barely noticed the costumes (so they must have been done well).

Elaine Cassidy and the actor who played George Emerson, who's name I've unfortunately forgotten (no YOU google it!) were surprisingly and wonderfully believable, even for a dyspeptic skeptic like myself. I'm looking forward to seeing more of them in the future.

I particularly appreciated the segue to the battlefield. As E.M. Forster didn't exactly fit the Rambo-mold, I had feared that this was going to be another chick-flick that was going to make some point about the gore and uselessness of war, yadda-yadda-yadda. But the scene was great! Unremarkable place, anonymous shelling, dead body, no pithy and lugubrious final words. I like that they kept the romance in the romance, and out of the trenches.

What a difference a cast can make: not one of the actors was half so good as those in the original, not one scene compared in quality.  There is nothing to recommend in this movie.  I rate it No Stars.",1208131200,5,392,4.47887323943662

3380037,3,B0015LPRSI,"2008's A Room With A View"" is a Masterpiece Theater dramatization of E.M. Forster's novel of the same name, adapted for the screen by veteran writer Andrew Davies (Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility). The film is produced to the usual quality PBS standards but the adaptation may represent a case of overreaching.

The story concerns a young and proper Englishwoman named Lucy, who visits Italy with her spinster chaperone Charlotte in the years prior to the First World War. Upon arrival at a pensione, Lucy and Charlotte find their assigned room lacks a promised view. A Mr. Emerson and his son George obligingly switch accomodations so that Lucy gets her view. In touring nearby Florence, Lucy gets to know Mr. Emerson and George, who are, shockingly, amiable but freethinking socialists and atheists. When Lucy witnesses a street murder, it is George who rescues her. On a subsequent visit to the beautiful Italian countryside, George surprises Lucy by kissing her. Lucy's shocked chaperone rushes her off to Rome to stay with a neighbor from England, a Mr. Vyse. Lucy and Mr. Vyse become engaged and return to England. The engagement falls apart when George appears in Lucy's village, forcing her to confront her lack of real passion for Mr. Vyse.

The movie features nicely romantic location shooting in Italy and England. Elaine Cassidy is very acceptable as the young Englishwoman struggling to deal with the conflict between her feelings and her expectations. The supporting cast provides good context for Lucy's dilemma as the touring party in Italy and her family in England. This reviewer wishes they had been given more screen time.

Being in love is by definition an irrational state; romantic comedy is mostly for the spectators as we watch people in love go through awkward self-discovery. The process is acceptable as entertainment because, at least in fiction, we expect happy endings. Andrew Davies has been remarkably successful in refreshing Jane Austen's novels for a modern audience, by bringing out points of interest for the modern viewer without damaging the author's original intent. In this case, he may have been less successful. Lucy's sexual awakening is unsubtle. Davies' new ending is, in its first part, a real downer, and in the second, rather implausible. This reviewer was disappointed.

""A Room With A View"" is worth a look as a different take on a familiar story. Viewers may form their own opinions on whether it is an improvement or not.",1208131200,,2486,5.056097560975609
8258955,1,B0015LPRSI,"I suppose this was true to the book in some respects, but it veered off course now and then.  I do understand that in adapting a book for a movie, some things will have to be changed or even lost.  This is why everyone always say that the book is so much better.  This didn't seem to capture the spirit of the book and that is what a good movie adaptation should do.  The characters of Lucy and George seemed so boring and unappealing that I really didn't care what happened to them.  The bit at the end (which I won't give away) just ruined the whole thing.  A little bit of unnecessary  ""realism""  that was not in the book at all an just spoiled the beauty of the happy ending.  I have read this book several times and am a fan of the Merchant Ivory movie, so it was hard for me to like this even though I really wanted to try.",1497484800,2,829,4.03680981595092

8258957,3,B0015LPRSI,"Yes, it was well acted and entertaining and some of the music was great..... But.. I can only watch so much of this period upper class British romance stuff without questioning whether they ever had much of substance to their lives. There were wars, disease, people starving, industrial revolution, scientific discoveries and development etc....but apparently the most important thing must have been aimless travel and who is romantic with who...and whether they are rich enough or not... Too much of it just puts me in an uncaring mood. The only reference to war was near the end when the love interest was killed....but it was not important enough to acknowledge for the rest of the story.",1470960000,,691,4.9655172413793105
8258958,5,B0015LPRSI,"Very different from the more famous version, but beautifully acted and set and costumes seemed to really give a more natural view of the period.",1453248000,,144,4.8
8258959,4,B0015LPRSI,"While there has been a lot of comparison made to the Merchant Ivory production of A Room with a View, in writing this review, I don't feel it would be fair to compare. I did watch both movies back to back, starting with the 2007 version. It only whet my appetite to watch the original 1985 Merchant Ivory production. Just to get to the point, I don't hate the 2007 version, and I gave it some time to process what was so wonderful about the 1985 version and what was so enjoyable about the 2007 version.

These are two very different movies with the same plot, perhaps dialogue even, but made quite differently. Another reviewer titled their review A Room with a Different View, and I think that is quite fitting. Let's face it nothing will live up to the Merchant Ivory production. That was made with love, heart, soul and a little bit of Pixie dust. The cast was irreplaceable: Helena Bonham-Carter, Maggie Davis, (gasp!) Daniel Day Lewis, Julian Sands (who I never fell out of love with), Judi Dench, Simon Callow, Rupert Graves (now on the BBC's Sherlock), Denholm Elliott (who has the most adorable expression in his eyes). Unusually, these actors agreed to a salary cut to perform in this production. Then there is the score. The music is to die for. I still swoon when I hear it. Every attention to detail was given in addition to a rich style production. And remember: location, location location. So you see I'm a fan.

But this newer version of the classic E.M. Forster romance is commendable as well. I thought it was well cast. Elaine Cassidy in the role of Lucy Honeychurch is refreshing, smart, and independent. Laurence Fox who played Cecil Vyse made the role his own. Rafe Spall was a worthy George, he didn't make me swoon all over the place, but I liked him. I honestly don't remember the score, but that isn't important. I'm sure it was good. There wasn't the attention to detail that we have been spoiled by from the Merchant Ivory production, but this 2007 version paid homage to the 1985 film with some of the locations and perhaps a character reprising a role (I don't want to spoil it). There was one  big difference in the framework of the 2007 version. It begins ten years after the 1985 version ends, then jumps around a little bit. I rather liked the new twist in the story, because that could have happened (even though I prefer to not thinking about all that) and I don't want to give anything away here, so I may sound cryptic. But, apparently the reason behind it is based on notes E.M. Forster left behind, but did not incorporate into his book.

So I think it's worth a viewing. If I had never seen the original version then I would be quite satisfied with this rendition. I do happen to like most re-make adaptations in general (i.e. Jane Austen movies, I own several different versions of the same titles) But, my opinion is probably in the minority here.",1447113600,2,2891,4.543186180422265

If I had seen this version on PBS first  I probably would have placed it nearer the bottom of my wish list and purchased it much later on",1426377600,,464,4.8
