5007356,5,B006NKFAA6,"I love the flexibility of picking & choosing which workouts you want to build into your routine for the day (and in what order you want to do them).  There are several new moves - love that feature too.

As others have written, I prefer the mixed ages, shapes & genders in the other workouts.  I'll echo the same on music - prefer some of Leslie's other choices over the music in this one.

I like the toning sessions but wish they were longer as well.

Overall, I'm very glad I purchased this DVD and it will be used on a regular basis.",1332979200,,537,4.174757281553398
5007357,5,B006NKFAA6,"I really love this new exercise dvd because of the ability to create your own workout based on the 5 color coded miles.  She has added new steps that weren't on my other 4 dvds, which keeps you from getting bored.  I have only been walking to her dvds for about 3 months, but I love the simplicity, the pace and the results.  I have had both knees replaced and have no trouble whatsoever doing each of the moves, even the new ones she has added to this dvd.  I highly recommend this and any of her other dvds for a great, walking based workout!",1332979200,3,544,4.152380952380953
5007358,5,B006NKFAA6,"Just tried Leslie's new DVD and it's a good one!  The concept here is that there are are 5 separate one mile workouts that are color coded, plus 5 toning sessions.  You can either pick and choose from the miles and toning sessions to build your own workout or pick one of Leslie's 5 pre-mixes, which have a different number of miles for each day (from 1 - 5).  Each of hers includes warm up, cool down, a selection of miles, and a toning session.  She has a different pre-set for each day of the week, Monday through Friday.  So there is great variety here.  The miles are fast (11-12 minutes not including the warm up and cool down) and include more combination moves with arms to keep your heart rate up.  The toning sessions are on the short side (2 -4 minutes), but are nice to add on to the cardio you get with the walks.  Leslie walks with a variety of walkers and does the toning sessions solo.  My only complaint is that when you build your own workout, you don't get cool down, and you need to program the blue mile first to get a warm up.  But, all in all this is a great varied workout with lots of choices for alternate workouts on different days and a great value for the money.",1332892800,2,1191,4.20704845814978
5007359,3,B006NKFAA6,"I just finished 5 miles and did all of the toning workouts.  There are different moves in this, and I did work up a sweat which was great.

That being said, the toning exercises are minimal in this.  For example, the arms just has 2 sets of biceps curls and then French presses for the triceps.  The chest and back just has 2 sets of pushups (girl style) and a back exercise.  The legs section has back lunges and squats.  Just a couple of minutes of toning in each section.  I guess I was expecting longer, more in depth toning sections.  I would need to do other exercise DVDs in addition to this for toning, as doing this alone would not cut it for me.

I did not care for the music at all.  I thought that dreadful ""Everybody"" song on her other DVDs was the absolute worst, but some of the tunes on this are worse.

Bring back Linda and Jo Ann!  I love Leslie's workouts where there are all different age groups and body types.  This DVD features young fit gals with frozen smiles.

My favorite Leslie DVDs are the Ultimate Collection and the 5 Mile Advanced Walk.  I've shed about 24 pounds since October working out with those DVDs, mixing and matching to do 5 miles a day 5 days a week.  I am a big Leslie fan, but prefer her other workouts to this.",1332806400,81,1256,4.214285714285714
5007360,4,B006NKFAA6,"I enjoyed the workout I got with this dvd, Leslie puts a new twist on some of her ""old"" moves, such as doing a grapevine/kickback combination, and walking up 4 steps instead of 2.  I really worked up a sweat. The set is bright and modern.

What I didn't enjoy was her set of walkers. What I've always loved about Leslie and her DVDS is that she had people of ALL shapes and ages walking with her. This one had mostly young girls who look like they were plucked from the pages of Fitness Magazine.  I'm in my late 40's and have enjoyed watching her DVDS and she shows people younger and older than me that have lost alot of weight doing her walks, as well as gals my age who are fit as can be! I think I'll mostly stick to those tapes and get inspiration from them and go to this one when I tire of my others.

If you are not as put off by that as I am I suggest going immediately to buy this because Leslie delivers (as always!) She's as high energy as ever and I love her no matter what!",1332806400,14,988,4.0

5007362,1,B006NKFAA6,I bought this DVD today and now I'm afraid to open it cause I bought another one Walk Slim 5 Really Big Miles and hated it.  I'm 63 yrs old and her walkers are all young enough to be my grandchildren.  She goes too fast and does not announce what is coming up next until she is almost doing it.  I have her old DVDs and I love those.  She has people my age in them and that's much better for me.  I'm in pretty good shape for my age but don't want to feel like a grandmother while exercising.  I did not enjoy the music either and I love all kinds of music including some hip hop. I guess I will not be able to take it back cause it is already opened.  So I wasted my money.  Will not be doing this again.  :(,1332460800,14,709,3.8013698630136985
5007363,5,B006NKFAA6,"Exercise Videos are finally making a really good use of technology. With this 1 CD you can create
up to 10 different options from a pool of 5 walking segments and 5 toning segments in any sequence
you want.
Each of the five, 1 mile options is a 12 minute walk that is color coded so you can select them in any order you choose. You
can do the purple mile, then yellow, then an ab tone up , then a green mile or something in reverse.
Or you can choose from the segments of 2 - 5 mile workouts that Leslie has already pre set by day of the week. The funny thing is you actually have the option to do 10 miles in any sequence you choose. While that is not the intent of the program, it simply shows the flexibility of being able to mix and match workouts, doing a favorite walk twice or doing an all toning session.

Of course there are some new moves that keep the variety changing, especially if you use Leslie's line,the ""walk-outs"" can get boring without updating the moves.
There is also a fresh set of walkers, which also helps as some past videos often featured many of her
wonderful staff members more often then one might like.
If you like Leslie's program then this addition is completely new.

Advanced users might be disappointed with the intensity level, which is not a high cardio sweat drip monster mile. That said you can do a little boosting with making sure your form is spot on, and picking up your legs a bit higher and using your arms when she may not be. Making sure you have a strong pump to the arms or raising them above the head. These miles don't use weights or walk boosters so you can certainly add a walkvest, or hand or leg weights. There are many workouts out there that are just too intense, where there goal is an extreme 60-90 day make over. Those are great, provided you are physically able to do many of the challenging exercises in those programs. Often people have to do the opposite which is pare down those high intensity workouts until their ready. Leslie's program is geared toward the beginner and starter intermediate who want to get started and tone up.

5 Stars but Room For Improvement:
What would have been fantastic, is if Leslie had used one of the 5 Miles as one of her JOG Mile segments and one as  her Bootcamp Mile segments&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-Walk-Weight-Loss-Bootcamp-Kit/dp/B003F3NDS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone: Walk Weight Loss Bootcamp Kit</a>.

5007364,5,B006NKFAA6,"I am not sure why this is on pre-order because I picked up the Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan DVD while in Target and yesterday I popped it in to walk my walk.  This DVD is set up with pre-programmed walks for Monday - Friday or you can customize it by picking the color coded one to five miles you want to walk in whatever order you want to walk them.  There is also a toning session for different areas (abs, arms, etc.) which are included one per pre-programmed days or again you can add what you want to the miles you like when customizing.  And of course, a warm up and coool down walk.  It may be the only WAH DVD you will ever need... Though I hope there will be many more to come!  :0)  It will be the one DVD I can take on vacation and still have a variety of walks for the week without have to choose several from my now 28 WAH DVD collection.

5007370,5,B006NKFAA6,"I've had this for months, and thought vaguley I was ""using it""  on the theory that if it's in my house, I must be accomplishing something. Uh, no. But about a month ago, when I decided to get serious about once again incorporating aerobic exercise into my Pilates routine, I tried Sansone because I hate exercising in the unpredictable, too hot, too cold St. Louis weather. When I tried her method, I was delighted to find that she includes dumbed-down versions of steps from aerobic dance when it was wonderful, like dance, and the step hadn't yet been invented. I worked for two years with a professional dancer, so I feel strongly about steps and combinations. The simple combinations and a variety of steps -- and ramping up the pace halfway through -- will make this my go-to for the foreseeable future. I like customizing my workout by choosing warm-up, one of the miles (not up to 2 yet), and cool-down, although some may prefer to do the daily routines instead. I wish I'd given this a good try sooner. But I'm doing it now almost every day, and feel virtuous -- except when Sansone's grating voice and especially her laugh make me momentarily want to reach through the screen and throttle her. But that's a small point: focusing on the movements is the point.",1489968000,4,1268,4.635555555555555

5007383,5,B006NKFAA6,"I love this video.  It's exactly what I had in mind.  Even though I've only done the exercises for Monday and Tuesday, I was amazed at how much was packed into each one (everything is on just one disc).  The exercises are easy to do, but it's the pace that makes it a good cardio routine.  Leslie has just the right personality for this - cheerful and encouraging without being unduly chatty.  At the end of each segment, there's a little something extra. For instance, for Monday, there is a brief period of ab work.  At the end of Tuesday, she includes some work with weights.  I have joint issues, so walking is an excellent exercise for me.  I always feel great after doing these.",1485820800,,684,4.416

5007399,5,B006NKFAA6,"Having lost nearly 60 lbs using Leslie's DVDs for fitness and diet (of course), I must give credit where credit is due.  This is my favorite of the 10 Leslie Sansone DVDs I have purchased over the last 2 years.  Here's why it works for me:
-I can program walks, up to 10 miles at a time (I skipped the blue mile because it was higher intensity at first)
-It doesn't require fancy foot work (I consider myself pretty sure-footed but most aerobic DVDs leave me frustrated with dancy-dance footwork)
-It gets my heart pumping
-It doesn't contain burpees, lunges, or any other grueling type moves that make me wanna: a) cry b) give up c) throw DVD at nearest wall
-I can use my pedometer and count towards my 12k daily goal
-Leslie is so peppy and motivating, she makes me want to exercise and get off my butt
-The production quality is high, the set is professional, the lighting good, the music is spot-on
-Leslie and the other instructors are not ripped, they are just normal fit people, like me
-Don't laugh, but I especially liked the outfits to match the mile: blue, purple, red, etc... FUN!
-The moves are low impact (except BLUE mile), I am 43 years old with tentative knees
When I started on my fitness journey, I would take this DVD when I traveled- my friends would snicker and laugh while I walked with Leslie, but pretty soon everyone joined in and we had a great time together.  I started doing 2 miles a day, then 3, on some days I would have extra time and knock out 4 or even all 5 miles.  These are definitely ""aerobic"" but not crazy.  I would highly recommend to anyone, male or female looking to lose weight thru fitness and diet, mostly because Leslie Sansone makes fitness as easy as it comes.  I have shopped around looking for high intensity training type DVDs, but always come back to Leslie in the end.",1473206400,9,1824,4.429850746268657

It's disjointed, the pace is all over the place, some of the new moves seem not well thought out, the ""models"" are stiff and inflexible, and the music is BAD! Heck! Joanne and the old crew were superb at doing all the moves, and their smiles and enthusiasm were real. One particular model  on this program looks and moves like a robot.

I buy some of the DVDs at Target or wherever and some on Amazon, and I enjoy them all. THIS one, though! Very challenging without all the hopping (I know you can modify the hopping movements, but I like that this is non-hoppy for everyone).

5007416,5,B006NKFAA6,"I've gone through each of the miles on this DVD at least once now, and I must say I'm really pleased with the workouts. All the classic walk moves (side steps, kicks, knee lifts, kick backs) are included, but she throws in a bit of variety too. Nothing too crazy, but it makes the workouts a little more interesting.

The DVD includes 5 different miles, identified by color. The red, blue, green, purple, and yellow miles. Leslie and her walk partners are all wearing the coordinating color for the mile they're on. There is also a warm up and a cool down segment. It also includes strength and toning sessions for abs, arms, legs, chest & back, as well as a stretching segment. Typically the strength and toning sessions in Leslie's workouts are brief, and this DVD is no exception. The focus is more on the walking, with some light strength training thrown in.

In the DVD menu you can create your own workout from the options listed above, or there are 5 pre-made workouts for each day of the week to choose from if you don't want to come up with your own combination.

It is important to note that each mile is it's own individual workout, so when you combine miles into one workout, there's a bit of a transition from mile to mile. This did not bother me though. The miles start out more brisk than a warm-up and don't get all the way down to a true cool down, so you still keep a good pace no matter what. Plus, if you're not super fit (like me!) then it can be nice to get a bit of a slower pace while you transition from mile to mile.

Leslie was cheery and talkative like normal! I always find her personality to be fun and genuine. It's why I always gravitate toward her workouts over others.

Leslie's walking buddies in this DVD are cheery and fun young women. The might just be really good actors, but they did seem to genuinely be enjoying themselves during the workout segments. You know how the exuberance can seem forced in a lot of workouts? I didn't feel that here.

I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys walking, needs a low impact workout, or wants a workout they can customize. I love that I can pop it in and do one mile if I'm pressed for time, or do 5 and some strength training if my schedule is open.",1458691200,,2248,4.34047619047619

5007418,5,B006NKFAA6,"I love Leslie Sansone and her Walk Videos.  This one is no exception.  I love the quality of the dvd, and the quality of the workouts she provides.  you get a different workout for 5 days a week to help keep your body guessing what's coming next and keep those muscles training hard and your body feeling better.  Sometimes she gets off beat with herself due to talking, but she always manages to make the workout fun and well, a workout!  If you like Walking, or want to do a walking program at home, I would highly suggest her video(s).  I'm still working hard in my weight loss journey and am a pretty decent sized girl, but she makes the workouts doable and enjoyable.",1458172800,2,672,4.379032258064516

5007420,5,B006NKFAA6,"This is my favorite of Leslie's videos so far. I love how simple it is with no complicated steps to follow (I am extremely uncoordinated so that is important for me to stick with a workout).

This DVD has a plan for 5 days of the week and you can mix and match as you please. I get so many different workouts with just this one DVD so I never get bored.

I've lost 10 pounds so far and my sister has lost 17. This is the only workout I'm doing and I have changed my diet only slightly. I don't really eat much sweets anyway, but I added a lot of fiber and more veggies and that seems to be helping.

If you've gotten discouraged by workout DVDs in the past. I suggest you give this one a try.",1457568000,12,692,3.9285714285714284

You can make this more difficult if you try.  If you are half-hearted about it, you won't get much benefit, even though I guess that's still better than sitting on the couch.  If you are a novice this would be great.  Even if you are pretty athletic, this won't compare to a great training run, but this it can still have a good place in your workout schedule.",1456012800,,511,4.07

I would not mind so much that you get five walks but despite the fact that there are separate warm-up ad cool down sections you still spend a portion of each mile warming up and cooling down which really lowers the intensity.  I stayed around 120 in he beginning and end sections and got up to 130 with heart rate monitor in the middle sections.  I actually counted each step during one ""mile"" and hit around 1,200 steps and so five miles would be 6,000 steps plus the warm-up and cool down.

5007496,4,B006NKFAA6,I was a little disappointed  with this dvd.  each day you basic workout for just a mile  then on Wednesday  and Thursday.  She ( leslie ) pours it on,1423958400,,149,4.0
5007497,5,B006NKFAA6,"This is my favorite Leslie Sansone DVD. There are 5 1-mile workouts, all 12 minutes each. The first 6 minutes of each mile are low impact aerobics, and the last 6 are high impact. When you do more than one in a row, it's sort of like doing interval training. It is such a fantastic workout.

There are suggested workouts for Monday-Friday, or you can create your own workout by stringing together your favorite miles, as well as the warm-up and cool down segments. There are also short segments (3-5 minutes or so) on stretching and toning different muscle groups, but I don't really use them.

I've been using this DVD for about four months now, and I haven't gotten bored with it, which has happened for me with other Leslie Sansone DVDs. She uses many similar moves in the miles (gravevines, knee lifts, kicks, side-steps, kick-backs, arm exercises, etc.), but each mile has a distinct flavor, and I choose them based on what I'm in the mood for. For example, I love grapevines, so I may do the purple and green miles on night, and different miles the next. I also like that on days when I am tired, I can just pop in one mile and do it with light weights, and feel very satisfied at the end of the 12-minute workout.

This DVD is definitely more intense than other DVDs I've done by Leslie Sansone.",1422921600,,1302,4.46218487394958

5007499,3,B006NKFAA6,"I have many, if not most, of Leslie Sansone's DVD's and like most things, some are better than others.  While the concept of having a different walk for 5 days and being able to mix and match to customize your walk is a good one, the execution was flawed.  On the box, the 5 workouts are named for the days of the week and it tells you how many miles each is - and they're varied from 1 to 3 miles.  On the DVD, the individual workouts are named by color, so if you don't have that case close by or instant recall, you're not quite sure how many miles each one of the workouts is.  That alone isn't a big deal, just a minor annoyance.

Then each of the 5 workouts has the same warm up and cool down.  While that's a little monotonous if you would use the DVD with any regularity, it's certainly not a deal breaker.  What I didn't like is that the longest duration of miles, which is on Monday/Yellow, with 3 miles, each mile ended and a new mile started and it was as if you were starting another new workout with the pace slowed down almost to warm-up speed and building.  So just as you're cruising along in Mile 1, that mile ends and you've got a different group of people in another color of outfits and your pace has to slow down, then build up again and that's repeated again in Mile 3.

I wear a pedometer and Mile 1 gets the most steps, followed by Mile 2 and then Mile 3.  Overall, I barely hit 4,000 steps for a 45 minute walk of supposed 3 miles.

Leslie is her usual personable self and perhaps a bit less giddy or silly than she is with the old crew of her instructors.  The gals with her in this series are all younger - some have been seen in past DVD's and some are new.  If it wasn't that the multiple mile workouts weren't a cohesive walk that gradually built in intensity, peaked and gradually slowed, I would have liked it.  I will use it for the 1 mile walks or even use the 3 mile walk in 1 mile increments when I'm only supplementing another workout with some walking - or need a walk of short duration - but I'll look to some of her other 3 mile workouts for those days when I want an actual workout.

5007503,5,B006NKFAA6,"I really enjoy this video. I found Leslie's personality a little grating (laughing a lot) but honestly not enough to reduce the fun of the workouts. I'm a very beginner and it's a relief to have something I can actually do. Right now I can only do one mile segment at a time, but I plan on working my way up.

So many workout DVDs are 'shreds' or 'ultimate body' or whatever, and it's just intimidating. It's nice to have something I can do as a beginner that doesn't kill me, but rather makes me want to come back over and over.

Just walk! It's fun! :-)",1419897600,,555,4.177570093457944

5007507,5,B006NKFAA6,"This is my favorite walking DVD ... Leslie's personality is zany, entertaining and upbeat ... some people think she laughs too much, but I couldn't agree less ... exercise can be a ""strange""  phenonmenon, and your mind can play some mean tricks on you  ... a ""too serious, perfectionistic  approach"" to exercise can turn off ""your inner child"" and result in you somehow ""never getting around"" to doing it ... zany laughter can actually be the impetus that may ""get you off your butt"" when all you want to do is ""sit around"", make excuses, and wallow in self-pity ... as an ex-aerobics instructor myself, I can safely say that (in between that lilt in her voice) Leslie is an instructor who knows what she is doing ... her workouts are extremely informative and safe ... on this particular DVD, one can EASILY ( and I mean easily!) design a personal walking workout or follow Leslie's pre-designed programs (she has one for every day of the week) ... whatever you choose to do, you will have a wonderful experience, and you will love the results!",1418774400,3,1045,4.6378378378378375

5007509,5,B006NKFAA6,"I started walking in the good weather (May), with a friend, and by the time the cold started in October, we were up to between 5 and 6 miles a morning.  We needed to keep going and tried this tape, the 5 mega miles tape, the original ""walk away the pounds"" tape (which is 3 very slow miles).  This one - the Ultimate 5-day walk plan is great because you can walk 1 mile, or 10 miles - because the create your own workout allows you to stack your miles and throw in some of the mini-sessions (abs, legs, stretch).  You can also double up - I like to put in a stretch session after the 1st mile, then do two more miles, two ab sessions, three more miles, and then a stretch.  The feature of making it your own workout is really fantastic and keeps your workout from being too boring/repetitive.  Plus, the moves are easily adaptable to folks with bad hips, knees etc....and vice versa - so for the people who don't think this gives you a great workout - consider adding weights, higher kicks, longer sets etc...Last, I just love her attitude.  She's just like having a class with a friend or walking in a group - time flies by and before you know it, its all over.  Would highly recommend!",1417478400,2,1187,4.272321428571429

I do a different one-mile walk every morning before work, along with the warm-up and cool-down.  It really gets me going and only takes about 20 minutes. If you are like me, you don't have the time or energy for a long workout in the morning. Furthermore, you can create your own custom combination of walks and do a longer session if desired.  I'm a big Leslie fan and find her workouts easy to follow. I also like her ""Walk it Off in 30 Days"" DVD. I do that one in the evenings when I have more time.

5007549,5,B006NKFAA6,"Here is another great workout video by Leslie!
This is such a fun interactive video. You can follow the weekly routine (a workout for Monday-Friday), OR you can build your own workouts with a warm up, how ever many miles you want, a cool down, and strength training. Each mile is color coded which is great because you can remember your favorites and chose to do those.
I would give it 4.5 stars if there was an option, only because I feel like the ""progression"" of the workouts is a bit odd. For example, each mile has a slower part and a faster part, so if you are doing multiple miles it won't really follow the classic warm-up, intense exercise, cool-down format. This is only personal preference though, and in the long run doesn't affect my opinion of the video too much.

5007554,2,B006NKFAA6,"I like the idea of being able to customize a walking workout, depending on how much time you have, energy levels etc...that's the good part of this dvd.

What I didn't like about this dvd was Leslie filling the studio with young women and no one over 30 (from what I could see) in sight!

What happened to all of the ""old"" pals that Leslie use to have along on her dvds, I miss them. These women don't seem like friends on this dvd. There isn't the camaraderie or personable vibe on this one, that was one of the things I liked most about her earlier dvds. Given her own age, I'm surprised and disappointed that Leslie is now apparently gearing new dvds to the younger crowd and leaving everyone else out. There are a LOT of fit women and men in the 40 and over group, why aren't they represented on this dvd as they were in the past?

I won't be buying any more Leslie dvds if this trend towards ageism continues. The Intensity Walk is still my fav of all her dvds so far and that one DOES INCLUDE people from their 20's all the way into their 70's. that's the way it should be.

I don't use the preset workouts, I use the Create Your Own Workout option, which allows you to choose which miles, warm up, cool down, and toning sessions.  You can make each mile as strenuous or mild as you like depending on how hard you want to work.  If you do all five miles and warm up and cool down, you will be working for about an hour and 5 minutes, which I love.  I am a fan of Leslie's, I just like her positive attitude and informative little bits about exercising and why you should exercise.  After a few repetitions of the video, you kind of tune her out but it doesn't bother me, I know the talking part does bother some.

I thought it was a joke and did the workout and it made me sweat after 2 months using youtube videos for the fast speed 4 mile walking as that one had a timer and the 3rd mile one did too which sometimes I use youtube to watch the 3 mile walk for days on my weekend workouts .Cons of this DVD : It has no timer and you have no idea how long workout is going to take and doesn't say on the DVD how long is each workout in each day which is my only issue and driving me crazy okay . I am still timing the workouts of each day of the week because I pause a lot and have a toddler . But, I love this simple workout that does make me sweat and her energy daily has made me in better mood when I dread working out. I enjoy her talking thru other people say she's annoying . I still haven't memorized all of the moves since she added new ones and the harder day that I did workout was FRIDAY AND it was 1:10 mins and I can say FRIDAY is long workout and I didn't pause during it . The others still waiting to see which days are shorter and more aggressive as I think Tuesday is and Friday so far . she's  not fake like the turbo jam lady ( sorry forgot her name ) have her DVD but I don't do that video no more  .I do this video and slim in six video . I plan order something else in near future from Leslie Sansone .

5007569,3,B006NKFAA6,"I'm a huge Leslie Sansone fan, and have done many of her workout DVDs. I was super excited to try this one and add a little variety into my weekly routine. I have to say though, after doing the Monday workout I have no desire to continue through the next four days. The workouts are choppy-three separate miles are played one after the other to make the Monday routine. As such, it feels disconnected and it's super hard to keep a good pace and flow. Each starts out slow and gets faster towards the end (almost to a manic pace in the Yellow mile) but the rhythm just isn't there. Even though I did three full miles, I didn't feel like I got a great workout in the end as some of her others. Just not consistent enough.

I had read many other negative reviews about her companion walkers, and honestly, before I put it in I thought that was a little shallow. I'll just focus on Leslie, I thought, doesn't really matter who else is there. Oh boy, was I wrong, and they are super annoying (no offense girls, I'm sure you're all lovely people). They are clearly fitness professionals, and frankly, they tend to ""show off"" with their moves. That's not what I want to see when I work out. I want to see average people, working as hard as I do to get a good workout. I found the brunette to be especially showy and as much as I tried I couldn't not focus on them at times.

In any case, I'm glad I took this one out of the library instead of buying it, because it will not be making it into the regular rotation. I hope they take some of fans comments and move back towards a full paced workout, and having our old favorite walkers and success stories walk along Leslie.

All five of the walks on this DVD are approximately 12 minutes long, so it's just a matter of what I'm in the mood for. As always, Leslie is a joy to watch. I love the way she interacts with her walkers and doesn't put too much pressure on those of us at home to get everything perfect.

It's easy, but you can increase the amount of walking and bring more difficulty in if you choose. You can also plan your own workout rather than just follow one provided like other videos so each day can be different. I love Leslie as she is motivating, serious about her work and a lot of fun at the same time. Safety including warm ups, cool downs and stretching is included. I'm recovering from illness and have felt weakened in mind because I wasn't able to do other videos. This video is helping me gain efficacy and trust in my own body, which is vital to healing and taking the road to a healthy life.

5007583,5,B006NKFAA6,"I have probably 70 fitness dvd's. Maybe even more than that. A few dvd's were impulsive purchases from informercials, and others were videos that I viewed on another well known website where you can preview dvd's before purchasing. What I have learned is that every type of exercise is not for every person. I think any exercise that a person does consistently with the right type of eating habits can produce results but for me, if I can't get into the exercise then it's just a waste of money. I really really underestimated this dvd because I have owned  Leslie Sansone walking dvd before and I just couldn't get into it. What I really like about this walking plan is that it really is geared towards someone who is between that beginner and intermediate level of exercising. For me, it's not about how long a person has been exercising more than it is about physical abilities. I've been exercising for years off and on but struggle to advance to the workouts that involve a lot of complicated steps and weird positions that I wouldn't do any other time of the day except when working out. I needed something that was realistic to my day-to-day types of movements, yet challenging enough for me to not get bored and still burn some calories.

Leslie Sansone has really stepped her game up in this dvd; literally. I like the fact that it is broken up into 5 days which means I don't have to wake up trying to determine what am I going to do today. Sometimes I spend so much time trying to figure out which workout I want to do that I don't end up doing anything so this helps out significantly in that area.  Also, it was good for me to get back into exercising after a long break without having to start at extreme beginner level exercise  dvd programs. It's just what I needed and I like that I can premix and tailor the walks based on my own preferences. I also like that she adds toning exercises to each days' workout. The toning exercises aren't that long, but it beats a blank.

Overall, it has been a really long time that I have purchased a fitness dvd that challenges me, is fun, doesn't have the dread factor, and is well choreographed. If you are like me where you haven't worked out in a while and you want to get back to it but not start out with exercises that are too basic, or too complicated, you still want to sweat and burn calories, and walk away feeling challenged but not overwhelmed, then this is for you.....",1392249600,,2436,4.428571428571429

I used to do Pilates, yoga, weights, and so forth, but I find I enjoy her workouts most; especially when I am not in the mood to workout. She has this perky attitude, but not so perky it's annoying, that kind of makes you feel perky yourself...even though you are sweating while trying to workout around lazy big dogs. I like this video and her other videos as well for cold days when you don't feel like going for a walk outside or very hot days. Hey if you're going to sweat at least you can sweat in the privacy of your home. Anyways I ramble, this videos as well as her others are great for anyone at any workout level.

5007593,4,B006NKFAA6,"I agree with others when I say the ability to create your own workout with the choices given is very nice. I have done shorter walks the last several days but finally today I was able to do the entire 5 miles plus the strengthening segments. Each mile is unique (see other reviews for more details) and the strengthening segments are short and feel effective BUT (the big but) doing more than 1 mile is a little annoying sometimes because each mile does start off slow (not to mention the several seconds of black screen as a new mile loads). I took advantage of the black screen to grab a drink of water and instead of slowing down at every mile I tried to keep my pace faster and continued with arm movements even when Leslie and the walkers weren't. Or I would take the opportunity for a slow jog forwards and backwards to keep the heart rate up.

Also my complaint with every Leslie workout I have done is the stretching at the end. If I follow her directions I don't feel limber and relaxed. I always have to do additional stretching.

Overall, though, if you know how to tweak her DVD's for your liking they are a great base that isn't too hard and actually makes me look forward to exercising each day (did I just say that??).",1389744000,,1233,4.356521739130435

5007608,5,B006NKFAA6,"This is one of my 2 favorite Leslie videos, and I have a bunch. What I like is that the walks are quick, that it is programmable and there are 5 to choose from for variety, and that Leslie offers different routines in different walks including grapevine, mambo-combo, step-tap, side-step going forward and back, and so on. Each mile is about half moderate rate and half accelerated. At first, the unfamiliar combinations tangled my feet, and I could forget matching the arms at the same time, but I quickly learned the patterns which you usually practice at the slower rate then see again at the faster rate, and built to 3 miles daily plus cool down, about as much time as I want to spend. The warm-up doesn't seem necessary, as the miles don't start out that fast. I love the energy of the 4 walkers she brought to this video, and the music seems better than usual--not recognizable radio songs, but nicer than just a beat. I always think I'll skip the cool down, but I always do it not just because it's right for my body, but because the music and attitude of it leave me feeling happy and refreshed. When I was shopping, I found the detail about the walks, colors, and times in the first couple reviews very helpful, but there's no point in repeating. Trust them",1386720000,,1267,4.489177489177489

She also gives you an option to create your own workout by mixing & matching. Leslie is easy to understand and easy to follow her routines.  She also tells you that if you are having trouble following the routines and want to stop, to just skip to the cool down.  In other words, not to over do it if you can't go any further.

I like the DVDs with five different mile walks so you have more flexibility depending on how many miles you feel like doing.  With this DVD you can follow the pre-made Monday-Friday walks, i.e, Monday is three different mile walks plus a few minutes of ab toning afterward, Tuesday is four miles plus arm toning afterward, etc. You can also set up your own workout by choosing which of the different mile walks you want to do with or without the warm up, cool down, toning and full body stretch. Very versatile. New music which makes it fresh. These really make me sweat!

5007631,2,B006NKFAA6,I have about 10 of Leslie's workout DVD's so I obviously love her but this one is a disappointment to me.  It basically adds different workouts together so when one is done and the next one starts your pace drops back to a warm up pace.  That just doesn't keep your heart rate up which doesn't burn calories at an optimal rate.  I wish I could return it. I only have one other video of hers I don't like so this is a surprise.  It sounds like a great idea to mix and match workouts but it is just not well executed.,1380585600,2,515,4.019607843137255
5007632,5,B006NKFAA6,"I haven't done a Leslie Sansone DVD in years, mainly because I felt that I progressed past them after starting to work out about 5 or 6 years ago. However, I love DVDs that have customizable segments (10 Minute Solutions, Lindsay Brin's Boot Camp), so this one caught my eye.

Each segment is a 12 minute mile. They are fast, and there are lots of moves to amp up the cardio. I use 1.5 lb walking weights to make it even more aerobic. In just a few minutes, I am sweating like crazy. I usually only do 2 or 3 miles, but I recently did all 5 miles, and yikes! It is definitely more of a workout than you expect from a ""walking"" DVD. My workout/exercise history includes 5 half marathons, strength training with a trainer at the gym, weights classes at the gym, the Firm Express kit, 10 Minute Solutions DVDs, Lindsay Brin's Post Natal Boot Camp, and everything Turbo Jam (except for Get On the Ball). I thought this would be a good workout to do on Sunday as my ""rest"" day. I'm definitely not disappointed that it was more challenging than I expected.

I haven't done the 5 day walk plan, but I'm thinking about using it for a week in between Turbo Jam rotation, just to give myself a slight break (even though I love TJ).

The 5 Day Plan looks like this:
Monday - 3 miles (yellow, red green, + abs)
Tuesday - 4 miles (blue, yellow, green, purple, + arms)
Wednesday - 1 mile (red + legs)
Thursday - 2 miles (yellow, green, + chest/back)
Friday - 5 miles (purple, green, red, yellow, blue, + stretch)

Some reviewers have complained that each mile starts out at a slightly slower pace, then picks up halfway through. Honestly, I enjoy that. That slight break at the beginning of each mile helps me gear up for the next fast section, and it's a 12 min mile, so it's not *slow* by any means. I'm a walk/runner anyway, so I guess I'm used to walking/running in intervals. This is the fastest paced DVD I can find by Leslie (at least recently in the Just Walk series in the new, brighter studio), and I hope she does more like this.

The only thing that slightly irks me (and it's really nit picking, I know), is that at the beginning of the blue mile, she refers to the fact that you just did the warm up. They were blue in the warm up, and since she refers to it at the beginning of the blue mile, they had to have done them in that order. But on the Friday walk, the blue mile is the last mile, so her referring to the warm up on the last mile seems a bit strange. That is seriously the only thing that I can find wrong with the DVD.

I am looking forward to more fast-paced DVD's by Leslie. This one is definitely a winner!",1379894400,2,2621,4.211155378486056
5007633,5,B006NKFAA6,"My typical workout routine involves jogging 3-4 miles or doing intermediate difficulty exercise videos, but when I became pregnant, I wasn't comfortable with doing high-impact / higher exertion exercises. I have had some Leslie videos in the past, but this one is the best so far. The customizability of how many miles you do is great, and I like that all of the miles have some kind of boosted / faster pace walking in them. She has a wider variety of easy to do moves, and the techno / dance music suits my personality well. It is one of my go-to cardio videos that I have been able to do all trimesters - makes me feel like I am getting the blood flowing and helps keep my energy up even during the most tiring months. It may not be a great fit if you are looking for advanced cardio, but this will stay in my library post-pregnancy as a easy way to fit in even a little exercise during the week.",1379894400,,899,4.2631578947368425

Like Leslie says in the DVD-our bodies were not meant to be so sedentary! So, I decided to do something about it and checked out a Zumba DVD and this DVD from the library. This won for me-hands down-and so I purchased it. Zumba looks like so much fun, but I just felt awkward and uncoordinated doing it. This video is simple to follow and effective. I love how you can create your own workout each day or follow along with their daily plan. I've been doing this now for 3 weeks and for me, that says a lot!",1377561600,,612,4.024590163934426

When I first tried them, I thought that the toning was too short but the next day----believe me your muscles will let you know that you worked out!  The cast on this one is good, with some familiar faces.  I love the variety of the workouts and that I pick which one will fit into my schedule for the day.

HER LATEST VIDEOS ALSO CRANK UP YOUR HEART RATE (THE POWER SURGES) SO THAT GETS YOU OUT OF A PLATEAU.  IN MY OPINION, LESLIE IS KEEPING UP WITH THE TIMES & CHANGES, BUT SHE STILL MANAGES TO KEEP IT SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE!  I'M A LIVING PROOF OF THAT.

There is not a ton of bouncing around mostly side steps, walk in place, and kicks nothing too exhausting or hard moves. You can pick how many miles you want to do for the day. Sometimes in feeling tired and i don't want to do 3 miles or i don't have time for it.  Each mile is 12 minutes which is good and the time goes by super fast. I find myself actually wanting to work out which is unbelievable for me. With other dvd's i would dread having to work out because there was a lot of floor work or the moves were very challenging. Leslie Sansone makes working out fun, shes energetic, and has a positive attitude and doesnt expect you to do the moves perfectly.  After you finish a workout you feel energized and ready to tackle the day.

Then if you are doing another mile, you have time to recover because the next mile starts out moderate again.",1376006400,,435,4.069767441860465
5007648,5,B006NKFAA6,"I've had ""The Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan"" for over a year now, and I decided to revisit it.  This DVD contains Leslie's fastest walks yet!  There are 5 one-mile walks as well as several toning segments from which you can pick & choose to customize your workout.  I tend to find Leslie's toning a little lacking, but I do love walking with her!

Each of the miles is color-coded, and each clocks in at around 12 minutes each (blue = 12:34; yellow = 12:21; red = 11:44; green = 12:15; purple = 12:09.)  Leslie's one-mile walks are usually about 15 minutes each, so she's really pumped up the intensity on these!  She's also added new music and new moves -- some of the new songs are ""Proud Mary"" and cool instrumental versions of ""Disco Inferno"", ""Born To Be Alive"", and ""Everybody Wants You""; and some of the new (to Leslie) moves include jumping jacks, punching jabs, and mambos (okay, she's done punches and mambos before, but this feels fresher.)

I don't ""do"" exercise plans or rotations; I just walk all five miles with Leslie and the gang and get a great low-impact cardio workout in just over an hour!  I LOVE IT!!",1376006400,,1118,4.472906403940887

It is fast enough for a good work-out without being too difficult and enough variation not to get boring. She doesn't repeat any moves so long at one time that they become annoying and tiresome or too tiring. The pace, moves, and even her instructions throughout make these 5 miles fun. For the first time in all my years of daily exercising, I look forward to the hour rather than dread it.

5007662,5,B006NKFAA6,"This program has 5 separate walks each about a 12 minute mile with some easy arm exercises incorporated to work upper body and increase heart rate.  Over the 5 days the walks are intermixed so each day is a different length walk...2 miles, 5 miles, etc The nice thing is that you can also configure your own workout mixing up the color coded walks to fit what you want on a particular day. The warm up and cool down primarily moderate your heart rate up or down. I don't find her stretches after the walk particularly effective. Her add on spot workouts for arms, abs, etc are OK, not great.

Pros: 5 really good 5 day walks with the option to formulate your own plan.
Cons: Not impressed with cool down stretches. I do my own.
  Spot workouts are just OK

Recommend: Yup, I would definitely recommend this DVD because the walking part...what  you are looking for, is great",1373241600,,873,4.459119496855346

Love the song that starts the green mile!!!!  Love that it automatically starts workout with warmup and ends with cool down so you don't have to preselect them. I love that she uses different types of boosts in each mile so its not boring. If you pick 2 different miles to walk, then you'll be walking for about 30 min since then it adds warmup and cool down walk.

As far as strength exercises- they are on the light side ....not many repetitions.....could be good for beginners or your light workout days. I love Leslie!!!!",1373155200,,679,4.641666666666667
5007664,5,B006NKFAA6,"I happened on this video when I attended my regular Zumba class and found out it was canceled after I arrived.  The substitute ""teacher"" put on this DVD and I sweated to this video as much as I do in my Zumba class.  I went with my friend and she felt the same way.  After class, we both wrote down the name of the video and we both purchased it as soon as we got home.  We've both been enjoying ""walking"" (and sweating) to Leslie Sansone's program on days when we don't have Zumba. The 5 levels of programs are fun and take up very little room. Leslie features routines for EVERY level of fitness. I'm a long-time jogger, I've taken martial arts, and I attend energetic dance classes several times a week (and I'm a senior citizen).  I also add to my fitness by using 2-pound weights while doing the arm motions, but it's not necessary.  This video is totally worth purchasing - for any age group.",1373068800,,898,4.315476190476191
5007665,4,B006NKFAA6,"I'm in the beginner-intermediate phase and find this has helped me move up and up in the length and intensity of the exercise I do. Because I am a believer in intervals rather than keeping the heart rate at a high level for an entire workout, I like the fact that each mile starts with 6 minutes at a moderate pace before picking up to six minutes at a fast pace. It does make me break a sweat; perhaps if I were as advanced as the people who like to go for five fast miles with no letup, this wouldn't be for me, but I suspect it will do the trick for a long time to come.

Sansone's energy is great; sometimes her patter gets to be a little annoying. She does do an excellent job of making sure most of the body gets a workout and some strength building, and pays good attention to alignment and the correct way to do movements. But she also makes some mistakes, including in basic accuracy. At one point she says that when you warm up, oxygen comes in, demanding more of the muscles. It's the other way around. the muscles demand more oxygen. She should know better or hire people to give her an accurate script. But the main thing is, I get a fine workout and feel well exercised, stronger and healthier in a safe workout that costs me a fraction of what I'd pay at a gym. And I can change it up enough to not be doing the exact same thing every day.

Be aware that it's not really a walking tape; it's a low-impact aerobic tape, though I don't know what the jumping jacks and other high-impact moves were doing in the blue segment.

I didn't give it five stars because of the following:

The biggest problem: Don't bother getting this for the strengthening and stretching segments. They're, in a word, useless, a couple of minutes long, leaving out most muscles of whatever she's doing. I simply don't use them at all so I'll have to get a strengthening dvd separately.

The yellow, red and green segments are too similar to each other. If the dvd is going to offer real variety, it should have given each mile a distinctive flavor.

The music, as many have mentioned, isn't the best, though I love the fast music in the purple segment. Cute and totally energizing.

All of that said, yeah, it's not perfection, but I definitely recommend it for intermediate exercisers!",1372291200,,2275,4.376777251184834

It has lot of options, it takes care of all areas of your body, the music is great, I love the energy of Leslie and the girls. Only reason I gave it a star less is because I see a label on my DVD pack which says ""Used, Like New"" so that made me feel like I was sent a returned piece or something. Good thing is its working fine and no issues so far. So, overall this is program very good!! Thanks Leslie, you are awesome!!

5007681,5,B006NKFAA6,"I have several Sansone DVDs, which I just started doing last year, but this easily my favorite and for several reasons. It's perfect for the motivationally challenged, people who are short or time, as well as for those who want to control their workout--whether they're relatively in shape or not. One of the things that I didn't like with her other DVDs was that I couldn't choose what I wanted to do, and this sometimes discouraged or bored me. Some days I only wanted to do a mile, while other days I wanted to more than that, or perhaps add in some muscle toning, since it's the heart of losing weight and getting in shape. I am also the kind of person who needs to psyche themselves out a bit to do something, and stopping to change DVDs or what not tends to stop me from exercising. I am not one for baby steps, nope! I also appreciate it because I live in the foothills and love to walk, but doing a good walk here feels more like a strenuous hike, and/or it's close to 100 degrees out. No thanks!

While I was more consistent with her workouts when compared to my other  DVDS, such as The Firm or Zumba, I was still struggling with staying on top of it and it would sometimes worsen joint issues. This is why I found this particular DVD perfect for my needs. I've been doing it several times a week and fairly consistently, but not religiously, ever since mid-March. I try to do a minimum of 5 miles a week, but I sometimes don't get to and sometimes I'll do more. There was a week or two where I didn't hardly do anything since I had exams to take and had gone out of town (going back to school in my 30s). I also do not diet, but try to be somewhat smart about what I eat and watch my portions to a degree. I've so far lost close to 12 pounds since mid-March just doing this DVD, gentle/stretching yoga and the occasional (i.e. rare) 10-minute Pilates, and it's now currently the end of May. Not bad for not being overly consistent and mostly doing 2 miles each time, I'd say, especially since it feels so effortless due to the easy movements when compared to other things that are high impact.

I love that I can choose to do one of the pre-programmed selections, but I often just pick the ones I like the most. I can do it sick, tired, or aching from certain health problems and having a desk job, and I can make it more challenging when necessary. Basically, short of popping the DVD, I have virtually no excuses not to do it. I usually wind up feeling better when I do them, too. I sometimes tell myself I am going to do the warm-up along with a mile and a cool down, but will often toss in an extra mile or so, just in case. If I don't feel like doing that extra mile later, I don't do it and will skip to the next part, but I'm usually having such a good time with it that I always wind up doing more. Somehow, picking out segments also doesn't feel so time consuming, but that is obviously all psychological. I also love the fact that I can add more miles than the usual 3-5 found on some DVDs if I want to, plus add in the muscle toning or stretching if I want to do that as well. This makes it useful well into the future, especially for those who want to intensify their workout later. I believe you can choose up to 10 different selections, including duplicates of the same segment.

I love the film set on this DVD for some reason, which looks fresh and energizing. Even the clothes they wear are cute and not as distracting as some of the ones in the other DVD. I appreciate the color coordination based on miles, too, and feel that was a good touch. The four women, while slender, are healthy looking and there aren't so many people to distract me or put me off, unlike some of her other DVDs, yet they give me something to look at. Some people have mentioned how they don't sweat. They do sweat, but these are also broken up--meaning, they do it different times. I kind of use their healthy bodies as inspiration to get back into shape, rather than hating on them. They're realistically fit. I also really like the music in this one, much more than some of the other ones I have, which is great for motivation.

So far, my favorite miles are red, purple and blue, which I tend to do the most, but I will also mix-and-match them with green or yellow. I believe two workouts--I think yellow and blue--have some very modified jumping jacks and jump rope, which I'm really not into. Sometimes I'll do them and sometimes I will just do something else. There are pauses between tracks/segments that last several seconds, but I just walk in place or keep moving. Yes, the pace can vary at the start of each segment, which may not be ideal for people who want high intensity, but I kind of consider this interval training, where you raise and lower your heart rate/muscle usage to challenge your body more--kind of like the P90x theory, just mellower and less insane tut. I also like the fact that I can make the most of what I'm doing by making bigger movements, and I later plan to incorporate leg and wrist weights.

All in all, this is great for all around muscle toning and calorie burning, but without the jarring, bootcamp-style repetitiveness found in other workouts. It feels good to do and I never have a moment where I'm wishing we could just finish with a certain move, like arms, because she mixes it up perfectly. It's mellow and easy enough to feel natural while you're doing it, making it good for motivation purposes, but i find it's far more effective than walking or using my treadbeast. The customization of this DVD is also great for those who want control or to vary their routines. It really gives you more bang for you buck. Highly recommend.",1369872000,2,5683,4.336466165413534

5007687,5,B006NKFAA6,I love all of Leslie's workout videos.  They don't seem difficult but I seem to lose weight when I use them.  I had a fat burner on my arm to see how many calories I burn with different dvd's I burned the most calories with these walking dvd's.  I have many more difficult ones and I burned less calories so go figure.  I am guessing the moderate level of intensity for an extended period of time is the ticket.  I don't know BUT they work!,1369008000,,440,4.129411764705883

5007689,5,B006NKFAA6,"I have several of Leslie's dvds but this is definitely a favorite. I like that you can program which of the 5 miles you wish to do for the day - you can repeat miles if there is one you particularly love. The dvd includes short strength training sessions - also programmable.  There is a warm up and cool down session separate from the miles. Because each mile is separate - the first part of the mile is at a slower speed so if you are doing 5 miles - you get some breathers. I use it a lot - makes me feel like I am in control. However,if you like to be told what to do and when - the dvd has workout plans for M-F. Something for everybody.",1368835200,,642,3.9384615384615387
5007690,5,B006NKFAA6,I love this DVD.  Leslie is so upbeat.  The moves are easy to follow.  There is one walk for each day of the week.  The toning sessions after the walks are short but effective.  I don't feel totally exhausted and out of breath.  I just feel like I'm getting a decent workout.,1368748800,,275,4.1923076923076925
5007691,5,B006NKFAA6,"I have several of Leslie Sansone's Walk DVDs.  I have some issues with my hip so I like the fact that I can choose the length for a specific day.  I also like that I can stop whenever I need to without having to call for a ride home :)
This is very useful for those rainy days when I don't want to walk outside or to take along on a trip.  It doesn't require any extra equipment, except maybe some good walking shoes and a little motivation.  I don't use this as my only, or even my primary, exercise routine but I have friends that do.  Her voice can get a little annoying but I just turn down the volume if it starts to bother me.  I would recommend this for many different fitness levels from beginner to intermediate and even advanced for a light workout.",1368489600,,759,4.129251700680272
5007692,4,B006NKFAA6,"This DVD is divided up into Miles of color. Then she has these other extra goodies toward the end, which I will explain.

Blue Mile
** The blue mile is the toughest. It's calm at first, but by the time you get to the second song, you'll have a lot of bouncing. It involves some quick jumping jacks and jumping rope, which is not bad at all, especially if you're around my size (164-159 pounds). There are some 'shifts'. She'll make you'll do at least two rounds of those in this mile. I really like the first part of the first song of this mile; it just got me really pumped. But once it started getting techno, the song kind of just blah... There is also a little 'oops' with their sound/voice. During the jumping jacks/rope, you'll see her mouth moving but it does not match what she's saying. You're taken off course with the moves for just about 4 seconds. It's not that bad.

Purple Mile
* This mile starts slow. She'll introduce a 'mambo' move with the feet. That's the only newest move. By the time the second song hits, You'll get faster and do some bouncing. It has some shift and side-shifting punches (almost like kickboxing). The second song in this one was somewhat interesting. It made you feel like you were in some other advanced time.

Green Mile
* There was another 'oops' with the focus of the camera. At one point the entire screen was somewhat blur. I thought for a second that I was probably moving too fast or doing too much. But in this mile there are A LOT of grapevine. I think one time i had actually counted and I did about 30 sets of those all at once while she was talking. I don't think she really meant for it to go on that long.

Red Mile:
* This mile was kind of neutral to me. There's some knee lifts. There is also side-shifting punches in this one too. She only does this in the Red and purple miles.

Yellow Mile
* The yellow mile is a little like the Blue mile, but it involves a lot of fast arms. Even on the first song, you're kind of brisk already. But I think this one is the easiest mile on there.

Other Things

- Warm Up
- Cool down
- Ab session
- Arm Session
- Leg Session
- Chest & Back Session
- Full body stretch

These options are not very long at all. Some are like maybe 7 minutes. I know the ones that require the yoga mat are probably 15 minutes. For the arm session she used dumbbells. One other good thing is that the DVD allows you to schedule your own workout. The system is very easy to use. So,I usually pick the warm up first, then all of her colorful miles (in the exact order as I have in the title of this review) and then her cool down.

**Pros**

- (edit) I said before that the DVD just goes straight to the menu. It doesn't for at least a few seconds. It will just give you that warning/copyright message before advancing. But there are no automatic videos that force you to watch it.

- A schedule is already made for you:
Monday -(Warm up, 3 miles, cool down, + ab Session)
Tuesday - (Warm up, 4 miles, cool down + Arm Session)
Wednesday - ( Warm up, 1 mile, cool down + Leg session)
Thursday - ( Warm up, 2 miles, Cool down + Chest & Back session)
Friday - (Warm Up, 5 miles, cool down + full body stretch)

- She is with other people, which I feel like can really distract you from the pain of the workout. I like to meet new faces and I like to see her interact and laugh with others. Her demeanor is as lively as ever. I think her body looks really good in this DVD. It really motivates me to get that calm hour-glass figure that she has.

- If you're a Veteran Walker and usually like traditional workouts with her, this DVD may be a little tough because there's a lot of bouncing. She likes to challenge you with knee-lifts A LOT, especially the double knee-lifts. According to my Calorie count, you can burn at least 313-446 calories if you do all five miles.

**Cons**
- The music could have been better. I know a lot of reviewers have been complaining about that. I'd give it a 3.7/5. When you first deal with this DVD yes, it may sound a bit weird, but the more you do it and get used to it, the music won't bother you at all. I've pretty much gotten over it and learned to enjoy it anyway. I really liked the cool down songs and even the warm up one.

- There is no clock to let you know how far you are, but I think each mile is like 12 minutes.

Other than that, I do believe the DVD is worth buying, especially if you want to mix it up. I am 26 years old, 5'4 and have lost 16 pounds with her. I was 170, now I'm around 157. I also use a danskins waist training belt, plus some arm wraps, which can help you lose that excess water and make you sweat.",1368403200,,4635,4.104972375690608

5007694,5,B006NKFAA6,"if this is the first LS dvd you've used you'd probably love it.  I have quite a few of her dvd's and this is the most recent edition year I have.  I use them 5 days a week and I really love her workouts.  This one is my favorite because of the different and fresh moves... but... what happened to Leslie??!?  Her hair is dark and flat ironed straight and her face... I can't put my finger on it.  But besides her physical appearance a huge difference is the background people.  One of the things I love about her workouts was that all the people doing them looked like regular people you'd see at the grocery store - young mothers to grandmothers.  This one has 4 aerobic models.  One of them is particularly annoying because she is over acting, huge fake smile plastered on her face and she's constantly nodding in agreement with who knows what.  Then she turns to the person next to her (who thankfully ignores her) and does these faces like, ""omgeeeeee this is so awesome!""  Haha, maybe it's because I use her dvd's every day that I see these blaringly obvious differences.  Like I said, this one so far is my favorite because of all the different and fresh moves but I just put my ipod on and drown out the music and the annoying banter :)",1367971200,2,1243,4.337662337662338

5007697,5,B006NKFAA6,"I have always walked for exercise, usually 20-25 miles a week. Last year, we moved from San Diego's ideal climate to the desert heat of Las Vegas. Walking became an impossible task given the high temperatures. One day I was selecting movie dvd's and I happened upon work out DVD's. After much research, I selected Leslie Sansone's 5 Day walk plan. I couldn't be more pleased as it suits my needs perfectly. In fact, I think it is much better then just walking. It incorporates aerobics and gives me a more vigorous  work out. It has helped me to lose some unwanted weight too. I am really happy that I found it. Thank you Leslie!

5007698,5,B006NKFAA6,This is one of my very favorite workouts!  This workout is for the intermediate to advanced exerciser.  Great cardio....I highly recommend!,1367625600,,139,5.571428571428571
5007699,4,B006NKFAA6,"I use this video when I workout in my home. I love that you don't have to learn steps. If you can walk, you can do this workout. Leslie keeps the pace where it need to be and keeps you moving!",1367625600,,192,3.707317073170732
5007700,4,B006NKFAA6,"I like this dvd so much that I have been using it several times a week since I received it several weeks ago. Sansone is upbeat and encouraging, and her fellow exercisers look fit and trim and happy to be walking/exercising with her. The routines have fairly simple moves, and she always lets us know what is coming up next. She adds new moves step by step so that we don't get confused. I have been walking for years, and this provides a fun alternative when the weather is not conducive for walking outdoors. I like the fact that Sansone gets us to use a lot of different muscles, and she explains why warming up and cooling down are so important!

The dvd has 5 different days of exercise sessions already preprogrammed, but one of the best things about this dvd is that we can create our own exercise sessions. To choose from, there is one short warm-up session, 5 different ""mile"" segments to mix and match ( color-coded, each with some variation in moves), some toning sessions that target specific muscle groups, and a short cool down.

Another reason I like this dvd is that the walking exercise is measurable. I have used Dr Kenneth Cooper's aerobic point system for years to measure how much exercise is enough to maintain a desireable level of aerobic fitness, and the fact that Sansone's walking routines are measured in miles has allowed me to add to my aerobic points each week, which has been super encouraging!  The main reason I do not give this 5 stars is that I do not think the 12-minute miles on the dvd are full miles. Walking at a fast pace on a measured track, I can cover a mile in 14 to 15 minutes. I have to jog in order to cover a mile in 12 minutes, so for the purpose of aerobic points, I count each video ""mile"" as 3/4 of a mile. The first 6 minutes of each video ""mile"" is medium intensity and not too strenuous. The second 6-minutes get the heart rate high enough to get us sweating. It's fun and rewarding to get to the end of each ""mile"" segment!",1367539200,,1981,4.363143631436315
5007701,5,B006NKFAA6,"This DVD is a good way to mix up your daily exercise routine. You can choose one of the preplanned workouts or devise the one that suits you.

5007703,5,B006NKFAA6,"I purchased this dvd mainly for the strength portion as I already own many of Leslie's previous videos.
The strength portion consist of a total body workout divided into short segments that targets
arms, back/chest, abs and legs. The strength exercises are short but effective.  What I like is that you
can customize the order in which you do the segments to make it more interesting or repeat segments to make it
more challenging. This DVD also has 5 cardio segments approximately one mile each that can also be
customized or combined for greater challenge.  The DVD comes with 5 pre-programed workouts for each day of the week.  The only negative in my opinion is that all of the exercisers in the video are at the same level unlike her previous videos there was always at least one person who was a ""beginner"" doing less intense modified versions of the exercise. If you are a beginner or have not exercised in awhile, I would suggest starting with One-mile get up and get started from the ""Walk-Away-the-Pounds"" series and build your way up. Overall however, this DVD is a lot of bang for the buck.  Positives are the versility of the DVD.  I also like that there are fresh new faces, new moves and new music.

I have been using Leslie's DVD's for over 10 years and I have a collection of over 20+ of her videos (I lost count). This lady is truly a blessing.  I love that she talks durng the exercises giving helpful advice on health, wellnes, and the motivational chats makes her unique. Her DVDs are no-nonsense sound exercises with classic moves that even the most amateur person can follow.  If you can commit 30-40 minutes a day 3-5 days a week the reward is that you will look and feel better and the pounds do fall off.  I view this as an investment in my health.  For only a couple of bucks per video I consider this an exceptional value.",1366761600,,1850,4.5119760479041915

5007705,5,B006NKFAA6,"Great work out and even though it is divided by days of the week you can still pick which ever one you want.

5007706,2,B006NKFAA6,"I purchased this DVD because I have several other Leslie Sansone videos, all of which I love, and I wanted something fresh and new. However, I was disappointed that whereas the cover says you are getting five different walks, ranging from one to five miles, you really only get five miles total. Technology enables them to be strung together into a walk of any length, from one to five miles. For me, the workout doesn't flow as well as in Leslie's previous workouts, where she takes you from beginning to end each time, moving from warmup to high intensity and back again to cooldown. In this program, you work up to high intensity for each mile, then pause and drop back to low intensity, work back up to high intensity, pause again and drop back before the next mile. To me, it seems artificial and disjointed. Perhaps I wouldn't have been disappointed if the cover had made clear that you are not getting five complete walks.",1366329600,8,929,4.602409638554217
5007707,4,B006NKFAA6,"I bought this dvd because I had Leslie's 1 & 2 mile dvds and was happy with them. I wanted something new and this fit the bill. There are 5 different days with different workouts each day. Monday is a 3 mile walk + Ab session. Tuesday is a 4 mile walk + arm session. Wednesday - 1 mile walk + Leg session. Thursday - 2 mile walk + Chest & Back session. Friday - 5 mile walk + full body stretch. You can also create your own workout by choosing from the five 1 mile segments, the cool down, the warm up and the 5 toning segments listed above. I like being able to choose which segments I want to use because she uses slightly different steps in each segment. For instance she uses the grapevine in a couple of segments which I like. I do not like the blue 1 mile segment because she adds in partial jumping jacks and a jump rope move that are more high impact than I care to do, but she always lets you know you can go back to walking any time. The warm up is a good length, but I think the cool down is a bit short. I also believe the toning sessions are a bit short, but the exercises are good so I just do extra repetitions after the disc finishes. Overall I really like the disc, I definitely get a great work out.",1366329600,,1217,3.9714285714285715

And to top it off you can either choose how to work out. You can pick Friday for a 5 mile workout, Wednesday for the 1 mile or create the combination you choose and add on the other extra stuff like abs, arms, cool down, etc.  So you can do a red mile, yellow mile, blue mile, cool down, abs for one day and change it up  the next.

As much as I love Leslie and her buddies, there is considerably less ""cheese"", and Leslie keeps the endorphin silliness to a minimum.  Some days I want the cheese and silliness, but not always.

5007722,4,B006NKFAA6,"I love leslie and her inhome walking programs, this one lets you pick whatever day or make your own, I guess i don't like the pause inbetween miles as she uses the same color coded miles and just mixes them up with whatever day you pick to do. I would rather it just keep going if I am doing 4 or 5 miles. In this video its like every mile is its own workout.  I also like that there are short segments for specific toning areas as well as a good start up and cool down.  You cant go wrong with leslie,",1364601600,,502,3.911764705882353
5007723,5,B006NKFAA6,"this is good workout for seniors. You don't need any special equipment and you don't get on the floor, takes very little room",1364601600,,125,4.478260869565218
5007724,5,B006NKFAA6,"Leslie's Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan gives you a real plan for exercise without having to over-exert. If you keep up with the pace to warm up, exercise, and cool down, you will have completed enough movement to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and the extra bonus workouts, which focus on different body parts throughout the week, are quite beneficial, as well. All in all this is a good program and is especially good when the weather doesn't promote getting outside to walk.",1364515200,,470,4.7439024390243905
5007725,5,B006NKFAA6,"I was pleasantly surprised by this workout.  I'm an advanced exerciser who usually does intense cardio and heavy weight training but I was looking for something that would make me feel good and not exhausted on those days I didn't feel like working out.  This workout was just the thing.

I should also mention that this is my first Leslie workout, so I can't compare this to her numerous other walking workouts.

Why I love this workout:

* Leslie.  I love her goofiness and yes, even her constant chatter.  There is just something so likeable about her.

* The versatility of the workout.  There are 5 different 1 mile walks, plus toning sections, warm-up and cool down.  You can do the pre-programmed workouts, one for each day of the week, a walk plus some toning, or design your own workout.  My usual workout is all 5 walking sections, done in different orders each time I do it.  This makes the workout feel new each time.  Each walking section is color-coded and is about 12 minutes long.

* Leslie's meticulous form pointers.  I find it's all too easy to get into a trance when doing simple exercises.  I especially love Leslie's posture pointers.  I sit hunched in front of a computer all day, so I love being reminded to stand straight and tall and keep my core engaged.

* All the different moves.  Leslie has you marching in place, doing grapevines, knee lifts and my favorite, the intensity spurts at the end of each mile.

* The cute background walkers.  I love seeing their smiling faces.  They look like they are having a blast and that makes me smile.

I would caution that the toning sections are very brief, 5 - 10 minutes, and aren't enough to really change your muscles.  But they are nice add-ons if you want to mix things up.

If you want a fun workout that will keep you smiling all day, then this is for you.  No matter what your fitness level, you will get something out of it.",1364342400,,1904,4.478134110787172

5007727,5,B006NKFAA6,Just walk says it all!  No fancy machines or equipment needed.  Just use your legs and walk.  I enjoy Leslie.  She knows when enough is enough on a movement and doesn't push you till it hurts!  Great DVD's!,1364256000,,206,4.315789473684211

5007737,4,B006NKFAA6,"This is truly one of the favorites in my Leslie Sansone collection. Love to be able to pick my miles rather than use the day plans she has, but I try to do every color once a week. Favorite is Red Mile! Only one thing I would change is that all of the walkers look so young. As a 50 something lady, I miss Carol and some of the others. Would much prefer a mix please!!! Nonetheless, a wonderful DVD and worth buying as it is so versatile.",1363392000,3,438,3.9886363636363638

You're moving every minute.  She also has a great warm up and slow down to complete the workout. I  have to work on those three a few more times before I tackle the 4 and 5 mile walks but I'm looking forward to them as well.  I sure do feel great when I complete them and it can't be more convenient.  No special equipment needed, just pop in the DVD and move!  I highly recommend Leslie's DVD for a great workout without leaving home!",1363219200,,599,4.156521739130435

It is set up so you can workout as it is laid out or pick which or how many of the walks you want to do, they are color coded and are yellow, blue, red, green and purple.  Each segment is a bit different than the others so you don't get bogged down doing the same things over and over.  The there are  strength segments you can add to your routines too.  This way you can mix and match your own session as you want it.
Right now I do the red, green and purple sessions and love them!  When I want to change I just go to the set up page, delete the current workout and program what I want next. Very easy to do with on-screen prompts.
Leslie Sansone is so motivating and encouraging!",1363046400,,713,3.9859154929577465

5007747,3,B006NKFAA6,I thought I would really like  this DVD but I don't like a few things on it such as her workout partners. They are all very young and skinny and look like workout models.  What I liked about the other Leslie videos i've used is the fact that she has workout partners of all ages and shapes.  These women don't even break a sweat or look like they are working very hard.  I don't like the break between miles.  Music speed does not remain the same from the end of one mile to the beginning of the next mile.  Does not flow. Will use her other DVDs.,1362528000,2,547,4.065420560747664

I have both back and knee problems and can modify this workout to a level of intensity that is appropriate for me.  The only reason not to give it five stars is that in order to get a walk that is more than one mile (15 minutes), different ""one mile"" walks are added for additional time, so it's choppy to move through the sequence for a given day.  In the interest of full disclosure, I haven't viewed the entire DVD, since I use it so supplement actually walking outdoors when the weather isn't pleasant.",1361318400,,720,4.609375

5007763,5,B006NKFAA6,I love that this CD has a different walk for each day. The longer walks even have a place where you could stop if you lacked time or stamina. Each of these walks is a great workout that will make you sweat and get you into shape!,1361059200,2,229,3.893617021276596

5007768,5,B006NKFAA6,"I have quite a few of Leslie's Walk at Home videos and this is probably my favorite one.  It is a great value for a number of reasons:

1) It provides a structured plan for the entire week Mon- Fri. It is great for helping you set a goal and stick to it- just follow the workouts for the days

2) All 5 days are complete work outs- warm up, walk, cool down and bonus targeting training area (Abs, arms, legs- etc)  You do not have to fast foward to get to a cool down or go back to access the warm up.  If you want to just pop this in and do a work out- it is the full thing

3) You can completely customize your work out with the interactive menu.  it really is build your own workout.  Add your warm up, select from the different miles (each one is a bit different) put your cool down at the end, and maybe select a targeted training session.  Select play my work out and you are done.  It is so versatile.

Bottom line- if you are going to get just one of her DVD's- get this one.  It is so flexible and really a great value for the number of different combinations and options you can set up for yourself.",1360800000,2,1109,3.9683257918552037
5007769,5,B006NKFAA6,"Wow!  I have several of Leslie's DVD's.  This one is my favorite!

Yes, you can do the pre-programmed days, OR you can select the sections you want to do & it will play only those!
Someone with a smart phone should post a picture of the menu screen where you can personalize your choices.  It's like this:  A screen lists the warm-up, each mile, each strength area (arms, abs, etc.) stretch, and cool-down. You click ""select"" on your remote as many times as you want and it will play only those.  I love it!

Also, the music is catchy.  I would not say ""Proud Mary"" is one of my favorite songs, but boy, it makes excercise FUN!

Five stars, Leslie!",1360800000,,648,4.333333333333333
5007770,5,B006NKFAA6,"This is not one of my favorites but I do enjoy it. Exercise made easy. Almost too easy. I have several of Leslie's DVD's and this is very mild compared to some of her others.

Leslie has a younger and perky group to walk with and new moves like the mambo, grapevine, shifts, heels, and new arm movements. The new moves are such a breath of fresh air. So nice to mix things up and ""get light on those feet"" as Leslie likes to say. All of these along with Leslie's four basic steps. It is very customizable and I love that. Makes it easy to squeeze in a workout no matter how much time you can spare during the day.  You can do 1 mile all the way to 10 miles if you want and add in several toning sessions. The toning sessions are meek, only lasting 3 to 4 minutes, but I think this DVD is geared more towards beginners.

This DVD is similar to interval training. After every mile the pace drops down and allows you heart rate to level off and then amps it up a little before the mile ends. Really not great for breaking a sweat and pumping up that heart rate but it keeps you moving and gives you a decent low impact workout. I do take advantage of the little breaks though. Grab a little water and check on the kids.

I also love the fact that Leslie has basically planned out a weeks worth of workouts for you. You don't even have to think about it. Pop it in the player and pick the day.

Monday: 3 Miles plus Ab Session
Tuesday: 4 Miles plus Arm Session
Wednesday: 1 Miles plus Leg Session
Thursday: 2 Miles plus Chest and Back Session
Friday: 5 Miles plus Full Body Stretch.

But like I mentioned before it is also completely customizable. Each mile is color coded (easy to tell due to the casts wardrobe) and has different moves that it seems to focus on a tad more or steps that are even present in other miles. So if you like doing mambo you can do the purple mile, if you like doing half jacks and shifts then you can add the blue mile, and add the yellow mile if you like heels. Then you have 3 miles and you can add any tone session you want... if you want a tone session at all.

It is a great DVD to get that body moving and burn some calories. And for less than $10 you can't ask for anything more.",1360713600,,2211,4.068965517241379
5007771,5,B006NKFAA6,I have a small collection of Leslie Sansone workout dvds and this one is a favorite.  Recommended by diehards and well worth the price!,1360713600,,135,4.625
5007772,5,B006NKFAA6,You can do 1- 5 miles - and mix up the miles to create your own custom workout. I have plenty of her DVD's but I like that she has streamlined them - in terms of the studio/the amount of people in them/and much less chatter! I think she is great but the talk can get to you after many uses! Love that she is incorporating strength training and focusing on arms/abdomen/legs...great workout! Better then the gym..I even gave up my gym membership!,1360627200,2,445,4.373493975903615

I think the music must have been cutting-edge when it was made, but I find it very irritating; it's sort of a tinny, retro machine-shop sound that doesn't vary much. I suppose I could turn off the sound and play my own music with it.",1360454400,14,326,4.45
5007776,5,B006NKFAA6,"I have many of Leslie's DVD's, and this is no disappointment! Compared to some of the older ones, it is a much better workout. I wouldn't start my day without walkin' with Leslie!",1360454400,,179,4.454545454545454

5007778,4,B006NKFAA6,"I am really enjoying this DVD.  I have bought previous DVDs by Sansone and this is by far the best - best produced and best put together.  I like the options for up to five miles and menu choices as other reviewers have mentioned.  I would say it is very basic for beginners or people who are just getting back into exercising (like me!),  I have a knee problem but can do these moves without modification (not including the little extra strengthening moves she throws in at the end, which i do not actually use).  I know that interval training and extremely difficult workouts seem to be the rage, but I like that this is something doable and enjoyable, that gets my heart rate up and my body moving!  If you are trying to work yourself back into fitness and need somewhere to begin, i would recommend this.",1360022400,,808,4.425675675675675

5007781,4,B006NKFAA6,"I really like Leslie Sansone.  My one suggestion would be that she include an option to just hear the music and not her talking.  I always get such a great workout, but her constant talking is annoying.  Please, Leslie, after we have learned the moves we really don't need anything but music to do them.",1359676800,,303,4.472727272727273
5007782,5,B006NKFAA6,"I for one enjoyed this video very much.  I've got her boot camp video (which I also love) and a couple of other ones that I still like, but got bored with quickly.  The music and team of walkers in this videos are a breath of fresh air and offer a more appealing environment for younger women, in my opinion.  If you've worked out to some of Leslie's other videos and thought it too boring, or not quite your style, then you'll want to try this one before giving up!  I'm not making fun of anyone's age because I'm no spring chicken myself, I just think Leslie is trying to appeal to women of all ages and not just the 40 and up crowd.  THIS video succeeds at that attempt.

Again, the beats are fresh and there are some different moves that I wasn't used to such as the grapevine with a hamstring curl.  Leslie is her usual fun self, and even kind of makes fun of herself for ""talking while walking"".  Even though she's sometimes a little corny, I can't help but laugh out loud while I'm working out, and that makes it all worth while.",1359504000,4,1036,4.223350253807107
5007783,5,B006NKFAA6,A fun way to mix up the miles.  Definitely for the experienced walker. Being able to choose the number of miles and  which miles avoids the boredom factor.  Thanks Leslie.,1359417600,,171,4.633333333333334

5007785,5,B006NKFAA6,"I'm just getting back into exercising again after taking a few years off.

Leslie has always been my favorite she's easy to follow and you get results.

Before I stopped exercising the last time I was almost to where I wanted to be. 118lbs (I'm 5'3"") with almost a flat stomach. Using mostly Leslie's dvds with some pilates workouts. It may take a little longer to get where you want to be, but her dvds are ones I can stick with.

This was the first dvd I grabbed when I started again. I love how you can customize how many miles you want to do. I wish this was out last time I was exercising because I wanted to do more than 5 miles at one time.

Now I can do as many miles as I want and build up as I go. Her dvds are so easy to follow that I turn the volume down and put my ipod on and listen to the music I want.

Other dvds of hers I really like is her walk and Jog and 4 Fast Miles.

I highly recommend this dvd!",1359244800,,919,3.835978835978836
5007786,5,B006NKFAA6,I love the feature of being able to create your own workout.  I really like Leslie's workouts--the has a nice personality and she's not too perky like some other video workouts!,1359244800,,177,4.709677419354839
5007787,5,B006NKFAA6,I love these workouts! Very intense or mild depending on your choice. Try it now...you will love it for sure,1359158400,,108,4.45
5007788,5,B006NKFAA6,I have been a fan of leslie sansone's workout for years. This dvd has all of the familiar moves with a few new ones added in. A very effective low impact workout. This dvd also gives you the ability to taper the workouts to your schedule.,1358985600,,238,4.195652173913044
5007789,4,B006NKFAA6,"Before my pregnancy, I was healthy, weight training and running half marathons. I'm now 6 months pregnant and unable to do any of my previous high-impact workouts. A nurse recommended this video and I was really skeptical, walking?? In PLACE?? I've done some of the walks, and once I got over the fact that I was just walking in place, it's actually what I need right now. I can make it more intense on days I have extra energy, but on days where I just need to get moving a little bit, following along is enough. The weight/toning sessions are very simple, but once you know the moves you can do extra sets if you're up for it.
It seems that Leslie has quite a following of women who have been successful losing weight and getting moving from a more sedentary lifestyle, kudos to all of those folks! But I also recommend this to other people who generally can do more athletic workouts, but need something low-impact for whatever reason (pregnancy, injury, etc...).",1358985600,,966,4.589595375722543
5007790,5,B006NKFAA6,"I love to walk and I love this DVD.  There are only five basic movements; a walk, a kick, a knee lift, a tap and a side step.  Each step is demonstrated first before a rep begins to give you the chance to get in step.  Hand movements are added in the same way, demonstration first, then into the rep. With the warm up and a 1 mile you will have done 15 minutes of exercise which feels like an achivement if you are new to exercising, you won't notice the time passing!  Leslie is not like other trainers, her people look happy, she is supportive in her language and they aren't all super skinny gym junkies pushing for a burn - they actually look like they're having fun!  Can't recommend this highly enough.  Plus, with workouts broken in to 1 mile sessions you can stop after one or two and not feel like you've only done half a session! After only three days I can feel the difference on my walk to work in the morning.",1358640000,,922,4.1807909604519775
5007791,5,B006NKFAA6,I have 2 of her DVDs now and they are pretty similar. I love that they are flexible and you chose the amount of time you want to spend at it. There are no fancy steps to learn and very easy to follow.,1358640000,,200,3.6744186046511627
5007792,5,B006NKFAA6,"Leslie's walking videos are the best. All you have to do is look at the ""what products people bought after viewing this"" area and you can tell, no one every buys someone else's videos. It's really hard to choose my favorite one of hers but this is probably it because you can break it into separate workouts complete with the number of miles you want to walk and warm up and cool down all with out stopping to choose the next piece from the menu. I was skeptical about how a video could be ""walking in place"" but it really works and it's not boring while also not being complicated to follow. I have a noticed a difference in my fitness since i started doing her workouts. I have several and love them all. I start every day with a workout with Leslie. Her workouts really are a positive way to start your day.",1358553600,,810,4.266233766233766

The walks are basic and will not over challenge you, but they do keep you interested and moving.  In my opinion this is an inexpensive method of starting a workout routine.  A good solid workout for under $10 is really unheard of.  You can't lose.",1358294400,,415,4.1375
5007794,3,B006NKFAA6,The overall workout serves the purpose of getting you moving and even breaking a sweat.  The biggest problem for me is that I simply detest the music.  Gives me a bad feeling.,1358294400,,175,4.4375
5007795,5,B006NKFAA6,"I bought this DVD a few weeks ago and I cannot say enough good things about it. Everytime I buy one of her videos I am always surprised how much better they keep getting.
This video is tons of fun, I love all of the women, the music is fun/upbeat and find my self dancing while I walk. The best part is that you can pick the order of the workout....there is no way you can get bored with the routines since you can customized them.",1358208000,,431,4.023255813953488

enjoy",1358121600,,118,4.95
5007797,5,B006NKFAA6,"I have about five Leslie Sansone videos and this is my favorite.  A lot of people don't like the fact that each mile is a separate workout with transitions, but I love that.  I just keep walking and grab water during the 3-5 sec blackout.  It is like that so you can create your own workout, which is how I use it.  I know what all the miles are, and choose the ones I want that day.  I also like that there is a slower half and faster half of each mile.  As a former softball player, I am used to training in intervals and find it is best for me.  That way I can go hard core in terms of big steps, sitting into kick-backs and side-steps, kicks, and strides for 4-5 miles, without my heart rate going too high.  I also like how each mile is med-high intensity with the warm-up and cool down separate.  For a few of the DVDs I have, I feel like the first half of the first mile is just warm-up and the last half of the last mile is cool-down.  I don't count those minutes in my calorie count.

I am in my late twenties, so I liked the youthful walkers and music.  It felt more to me like an aerobics class I might go to at my old gym.  Nothing against the older walkers in the earlier videos, but it made me feel a little depressed at how out of shape I let myself get; that I was doing a workout for grandmothers.  No offense to the grandmothers out there.  Just if her goal was for this DVD to reach to a young audience it worked with me.

My second favorite is 5 Day Slim Down.",1357948800,5,1480,3.9661016949152543

Today is Monday so I'm going to do this in order all week and see how if goes to ease myself back into the swing if things.

I did the 5- mile walk Friday and it was not easy! I was pretty worn out by the end after an hour and ten/fifteen mins - but I felt good about burning all those calories and sweating. So I'm hoping by this Friday I'll be able to do five miles with more ease. I've noticed that Leslie looks more in shape than the ""Walk Your Belly Flat"" video - maybe that one was alot older and thus video is more recent? Oh well not that it matters but she looks better and acts more perky in this video.

Great walk! :)",1357516800,,788,3.981012658227848

5007803,5,B006NKFAA6,"Leslie has a winner here, that I will use for YEARS. With five different walks, the DVD (thanks) is set so you can design your own mix of what is on it. Great for time constrained people. PLUS it is varied. BUT remember, based on walking--it is varied within the constraints of the human body. So it does repeat a fair amount. Remember, is about WALKING...and walking is either forward, back or sideways. Personally, I listen to radio or music while DVD is on mute. My suggestion to mix it up with more variety.",1357257600,,511,4.446808510638298

5007810,5,B006NKFAA6,"I'm a walker and I live by the beach where there's a boardwalk so during the Spring and Summer, I've got it made. But I also live in the Northeast USA, where Winters and even Autumns are really cold so I was looking for something I could do at home during that part of the year. This workout DVD turned out to be exactly what I was looking for: I walk Monday through Friday, there's a workout plan for Monday through Friday; I wanted to save money by purchasing an all-inclusive as opposed to a single target area DVD, this one has a plan for the entire body.

I could ""feel it"" the next day after I first tried it and that's always a good sign.

Really like the customized workout feature as well. Normally, I follow the plans day by day but occasionally I like to tailor a walking workout to supplement my different yoga routines on the weekend.

I read some complaints about the music but I liked it. I prefer standard workout music that is about beat/tempo as it relates to the pace of the workout (none of this new trying-too-hard-to-be-hip kind of stuff). It's also fun, starting off with this every morning keeps me energized and moving throughout the day.",1354320000,13,1163,4.425233644859813

I reccommend Leslie's dvd's to anyone whatever their age or whether they're a novice or an expert.,1353715200,,396,4.116883116883117
5007814,5,B006NKFAA6,"i admit:  i hate exercising but love the energy i feel after i do so.  Simply put, i get bored exercising and just don't have the motivation to do so.  I'd say i am a seasoned DVD fitness exerciser as I have a good collection of quality vids from Cathe, Christi Taylor, firm to Dasha Libin's Kettlekickboxing.  I consider myself intermediate as i am returning to watching my weight and regularly doing fitness vids.

Now put in the picture:  Leslie Sansone just walk 5 day plan.  wooohoo.  i really look forward working out.  This video just makes me smile.  Love Leslie here as she is motivating and just pleasant to be with.  Yea so what if she talks alot?  it makes time go faster.  Her companions in all the segments are fun to watch too and also make me smile.  I have owned older vhs Leslie and this is different.  You just don't walk here and pump your arms.  You do side steps, kicks, etc along with arm movements.  You can go as fast as their pace or even faster and i find my HR still going up and i do break a sweat.  I think this vid has helped me tone my legs more (i am never the skinny leg gal type and have thick short muscular legs) and helped me cardio-wise.

Dislikes:  music could be better.  there are some annoying shrilly dance music,  but eventually you kind of block it off after a while.

format:  each mile is one color.  blue mile = 1 mile.  green mile = 1 mile etc.  Toward the halfway end of the mile, Leslie will pick up the pace a bit more.
be careful if you have an old DVD player:  when i pressed on the monday (or any of the daily workout days) workout, it would only let me do one colored mile, instead of the monday miles (which is 2 or 3 miles).  I can only do the create your own workout where you programwhich color mile(s) you want to do.  i still like this b/c i can chose what i want to do....so really not a complaint.  just a heads up for those who own older dvd plyrs.  there is also a mini-weight training part but quite beginner level so i don't do it.

In summary:  awesome video.  my to-go vid as intermed. exerciser b/c you can go faster than Leslie's pace (which is already fast in 2nd half of the mile).  Video is FUN and Leslie's chatting and her companions just make the video pleasant and thereby making the workout go faster.  in 15 min, you have done a mile.....now that's better than doing absolutely NOTHING.  if you have owned older leslie vid, try this one:  it is more than just walking in place.

If you chose anything over a 1 mile walk, it still does it mile by mile so it's not like 5 separate workouts, they are labeled 'blue mile' 'yellow mile' 'red mile' green mile' 'purple mile.' So if you choose Tuesday which is supposed to be a 2 mile workout, it is actually the blue mile then pauses and switches next to the yellow mile. So your heart rate doesn't stay at a high pace for the main part of the workout, after the first mile it will go back down again at the beginning of the 2nd mile then work it's way up again, so it's not consistent. It does have an option where you can create your own workout by selecting which miles and toning exercises you want to do which is nice. I love the ab, arm, and leg toning exercises, they are intense and only a few minutes. She is not alone in the miles but in the toning she is by herself.

The ""choose your own workout"" option is great on the days when I feel like changing up my normal routine.  I am definately happy with my purchase!  Looking forward to seeing what she comes out with next!",1347580800,,306,4.315789473684211
5007832,4,B006NKFAA6,"As always I like Leslie's work out especially the one that we can customize.
The only downfall with Leslie's DVD is that one of the workout from a previous purchase doesn't have sound which makes it difficult to follow. The quality of the DVD is not good, it sometimes static and the sounds come on and off.",1346198400,,307,4.4035087719298245
5007833,3,B006NKFAA6,"I love Leslie and her walks, but despite the cool customization component, this is a boring set.  The miles lack her usual spark, the music is this shrill techno, and the full five miles just seem long. (Walk Slim Fast & Firm, Four Really Big Miles and Walk Away your Waistline with Walkbelt are sweatier and more fun.)I do like the countdown in the final five seconds.

She's got some nice new walkers on this one but they are just background. I miss Joann, Linda and of course Mary Kay--they seemed like a tight group who were out there sweatin' and having fun.",1346112000,,563,4.456310679611651
5007834,5,B006NKFAA6,"I was VERY excited about this DVD because I can feel my body was getting use to my other work out which I believe is the cause for my plateau.
I started this DVD on Wednesday last week and after my work out I felt FANTASTIC!! if you are not familiar with the Walk at Home DVD's they all start with learning the basic steps, and each move thereafter is built off of these three.

Walking in place
Leg lifts
Side step

This DVD is unique whereas you can create your own workout using the color coded workout...Blue, Green Red and Yellow miles. I LOVE THEM ALL! But each one has its own personality. I would have liked to see more advanced walking in one of the mile segments maybe a 1 mile booster for a greater audience.

Monday - 3 Mile Walk + Ab Session - the ab session takes place after the workout and cool down. These mat core exercises you will feel after your first session.

Tuesday - 4 Mile Walk + Arm Session - wow my arms and back is my target area and this session of push and pull Oh weee hurt me!

Wednesday - 1 Mile Walk + Leg Session - All I can say here is Go Legs! Go!

Thursday - 2 Mile Walk + Chest & Back Session - stretching my upper body takes me back to Tuesday no pain no gain.

Friday - 5 Mile Walk + Full Body Stretch - 5 miles and a stretch says it all.

I really like this DVD it has made it to my top 10 Leslie Sansone DVD's right along with the Weight Lost Series.",1346112000,3,1395,3.9395017793594307
5007835,3,B006NKFAA6,"I like this DVD because it has a different workout for each day as well as a ""Create Your Own Workout"" where you can change it up however you like. The packaging is not as durable as most of my other Leslie Sansone DVD's. It seems to be more like thin cardboard and not hard plastic.
I'm a great fan of Leslie Sansone DVD's and have close to two dozen of them. I work out to a different one each day. I do, however, get tired of some of the same music being used on different DVD's and am very disappointed that this seems to continue with new Walk At Home DVD's. I can no longer listen to the ""Everybody"" song that is used when the boosted segment starts. That song is used at least four times on different DVD's in my collection. Surely there must be other music with the same beats per measure that could be used. I believe if each new DVD is truly ""a new DVD"", the music should not have been used previously on any of Leslie's DVD's. Why pay more money for the same moves and same music with only some new faces in the crowd. For me it's actually the music that can be the real motivator to determine how hard I workout. That being said, I still love to hear Leslie's voice along with her encouragement get me started on my workouts.",1344988800,3,1237,4.158333333333333

I'll never get bored with this one because you can customize OR follow the five day plan.",1344902400,,264,4.458333333333333
5007837,5,B006NKFAA6,"I own and rotate between no less than 12 of Leslie Sansones workouts.  As a runner (1/2 marathon and currently training for my first full marathon) I love to use these as an alternative to the treadmill and for keeping me in shape during 'off-season'.  I use ankle and wrist weights on most workouts to intensify things as needed and can get a good workout (just a tip for those whose conditioning has increased to the point where the walks are really cutting it) :)

This DVD is in my top 3 favorites because I can pick/choose which miles I like/don't like and create my own workout- and I can do more than 5 miles. :) That alone is worth it!  I am 36 and likely on the younger set of those who use Leslies Workout (I have used them for 8 years), so I really enjoyed the new music and new faces.  I love Mary Kay, Linda et al, but honestly need a break from seeing the same group of people and hearing the same songs (""Everybody"").  While they were obviously paid participants, I was very inspired by the fit, young women on this DVD- some of them were really doing BIG movements as opposed to other walkers in previous DVDs who barely lift their feet off the ground. I enjoyed the new moves and love that the miles are all pretty up-tempo w/ no huge slow downs when you start the next one- yes, there is a slow down, but its not terrible.

So Leslie- here's my vote for more intense, fast & long walks w options!  Intervals are awesome :)",1344384000,,1440,4.249084249084249

5007839,4,B006NKFAA6,"Leslie FINALLY uses DVD technology!  You can actually customize your workout.  Love it!  I only have one complaint, the miles are referred to by color instead of by length.  Just a tad bit annoying.  I recommend this for novice as well as expert walkers.  Leslie's the same bubbly person she always is.",1343260800,2,302,4.711538461538462
5007840,5,B006NKFAA6,"I get bored very easily with workout videos and I hate doing the same thing over and over. But I also don't want to invest a lot of money in buying several different videos.  What's great about this video is that you can create several different workout combos from this.  It's set up as a 5-day walk plan - ex. Monday is a 3 Mile Walk w/ Ab Session, Tues is 4 Mile Walk with arm session, etc., but you can create your own as well.  I like to do 4-5 Miles and then add at least 2 toning sessions. Some days when I don't have much time, I'll do a quick mile and 1 toning session. The miles are all different - the Green and Yellow ones seem easier, the Blue one is more challenging w/ the jump rope and jumping jack type exercises added.  Also, with the walking and toning sessions, I love that I'm getting an all over body workout.  My husband has said how tone my body is now and that my arms have that ""ripped"" look. I was so excited when I was able to fit into a size 5/6 jeans! Since I've started using the Leslie Sansone videos 6 months ago, I have lost 33 pounds. (This of course is in combo with monitoring what I eat on myfitnesspal.com) To review:

The plus on getting this video:
- Good for beginners to intermediates
- Offers a lot of combo workout routines
- Includes toning exercises (hand weights, abs, legs, arms, stretches)
- Uses 12 minute miles which keeps you on a good pace
- Music is not too bad
- Leslie explains everything very well

My criticisms:
- I wish the toning sessions were longer. They are only 3 - 4 minutes.
- On 3 of the miles, she uses a punch sequence and on 2 of them - the punch count isn't even. For example - you punch 10 times w/ a right arm and then 12 times on the other. I always add more to keep it even.

Overall, I would give this video an A-.  It's my favorite out of all of the Leslie Sansone videos I have. I would definitely recommend adding this one to your collection!  Happy walking!",1342656000,19,1939,4.092348284960422

I walk every day outside, however, due to the heat - I needed to keep up my walks - but needed to walk inside!  Instead of driving somewhere (I am not a gym member) - or getting an expensive treadmill that I cannot afford nor do I have room for - I purchased this tape.  You can do as many miles as you want and I love that it is labeled per days of the week and so you are not doing the same walk each day.  There are also cool down exercises.

Floor exercises are out unless there is a crane available to get me up. I can walk well now and enjoy walking the dog though with his stop and sniff routine, it is not aerobic.  So this works well for me. My heart rate increases and I sweat. I feel like I did something good for myself each time. I alternate her tapes, using a different one each day, averaging 5 days a week and then repeat. Her laugh does bother me and the incessant talking.  But she is so warm hearted and encouraging to her viewers that I try to overlook that.  I usually set it for a 5 mile walk and only add one of the strength training sessions.  I like all of her tapes for different reasons.",1340496000,12,806,4.174193548387096

She has given you your choice of 5 pre-programmed sessions OR you can easily create your own. Simply choose between different 'color coded' walks and an array of short sessions including abs, legs, arms, warm up, cool down, etc. This DVD offers a new and fresh cast of walkers, an updated studio backdrop, new upbeat music and clear step-by-step instructions. This is not a leisurely stroll, but more of a walking aerobic workout. Prepare to break a pleasant sweat! Get off that couch and get moving :)",1339718400,6,590,4.737864077669903

It is still low impact, but with a little bit more power added to it, so you get a better more intense workout. There are some new moves introduced that are exciting, such as the grapevine and punches. I love the variety that the dvd offers so that you do a different workout everyday and you get to mix and match or choose the ones you like to do on any given day. This keeps me from getting bored.

Her DVD's give me a great workout. I can do one mile or go for two or three depending on the time I have. My TOPS group has purchased this DVD to give as a prize to our biggest loser of the month.

I found it a pain that when you choose the 5 miles which is what I do that you then have to go back to each mile so you can do the extras that come with this DVD - time consuming.  A few new moves and music, but much the same in general.  I wish we could have 1 DVD where we could do 5 miles or more without having to warm up and cool down every mile as again I have to advance the DVD and by pass the warmups/cool downs for each mile while I keep jumping around to keep my heart rate up.",1338336000,5,617,3.6165413533834587

5007858,4,B006NKFAA6,"Well, I have only done two day's worth of this dvd, but it is a great one.  This one, like the 5-Really Big Miles, adds a lot of new combinations.  Grape vine with kick backs, shift with punches, jump rope, jog, and the knee lifts with big arm movements (kicks my butt) and more.  There really isn't any ""down time"" in the segments.  Generally when I have a 3 or more mile walk with Leslie I have to have water, but with these, I just don't have time to drink it if I want to keep up.  You can customize the workouts or use the pre-selected format for Monday-Friday.  So far I have just used the daily mixes, no customizing.

This is a higher impact workout than some of her other dvds.  If you have bad knees (which I do) some of these moves can be a little trying.  She does the grapevine kick-back combos for extended periods as well as the double knee lifts with huge arm movements & the jump rope segment in one of the miles will be tough on you.  Each mile finishes strong - she really picks up the pace and keeps you moving & that heart rate up.  Transitions to new mile segments are the only semi-down time since you switch back to a slower pace for a bit.  I think the intensity level are higher, because if you have been doing WATP for a long time you will notice Leslie is probably at her thinnest.

I have found this to be an awesome dvd, challenging and refreshing with the new moves.  It really adds some variety if you have been doing her workouts for a long time.  The ONLY reason I did not give it 5 stars is because each workout day is supposed to add post walk focused workout routine for abs, arms, legs etc.  So, Monday's plan includes an ab workout afterward, but the routine is only a few minutes long, definitely not enough to see results.  I was very disappointed.  Tonight was arm workout and it literally consisted of two different types of bicep curls and one tricep exercise repeated twice.

All in all, I am really happy with this dvd (also try the 5 Really Big Miles, the 3miles on the Burn Body Fat is good as well)",1337644800,2,2047,4.215938303341902

Having watched some DVDs upwards to 100x, I know when the next breath is coming let alone the dialogue!  Thus, the varied workout seems fresh day after day.  Tech improvements are nice in that the warm-up & cool-downs are automatically spliced onto the selected segments.  Nice work Leslie, I appreciate the new options and will keep on walking, guaranteed!

5007868,5,B006NKFAA6,"About me: I am 31 years old, 230lbs, in pretty good shape despite my weight and workout regularly (at least 5-6 times a week). I enjoy Leslie Sansone walks because they are what inspired me to workout and stick to a steady fitness program. About 3 years ago I started walking with her and have lost about 55lbs (eating better and doing other workouts as well). Her workouts just plain make me feel good. I enjoy her DVD's, along with Bob Harper Inside Out Method, Piloxing, Barre workouts, elliptical and hiking; this might give you an idea of the types of workouts I typically do.

I purchased this DVD from Target, not Amazon. So, I have no comment on shipping, just on the DVD itself. I would have purchased it through Amazon, but didn't want to wait for it to arrive in the mail. :) There are some negative reviews of this DVD which made me a little nervous as to whether or not I would like the workout. I loved it. I feel like some of the other DVD's that Leslie Sansone has put out are a little dated and have some music that I really don't care for. However, I have always loved the walks. I actually enjoy the music on this DVD. It's a bit simplistic, but fresh and energetic. I don't care for songs with words because I really don't sing along to them or pay attention to the words anyway. I listen for the beat and all of this music has a strong and ""happy"" beat. The DVD is a bit choppy in that it takes a minute to load when one walk has finished and another starts (if you're doing more than one mile). I keep walking or do jumping jacks during the pauses. I really liked that the miles started off slowly and built up to a faster pace. In doing this I was able to focus on strength during the first part (slower pace) of the walk and cardio on the second (faster pace). What I mean is that the slower pace allowed me to dip deeper into the side steps, lift my legs up much higher, twist my upper body during knee lifts and really get into the moves and use some muscle. The faster pace is where I boosted the entire time, just as she does in some of her other videos. I liked the ""models"" she had exercising along with her. I enjoy seeing people smiling and am motivated by those that exaggerate the moves. It makes me want to smile and really move as well! The change from her normal walkers and music was good, in my opinion. All in all, the video allowed me to work up a really good sweat and also have some fun. Though the toning segments are a little lacking, short and easy. I alternate strength training with cardio, so that didn't bother me because I get my normal strength training in on other days.",1335916800,7,2623,4.225099601593626
5007869,4,B006NKFAA6,"I am a huge fan of Leslie Sansone.  She was smart enough to ""invent"" walking at home, which is a great idea.  I have walked with her for many years and have many of her DVD's, but am always looking for a variety of workouts to add to my library.  After trying out her new Ultimate 5-Day Walk Plan, I can honestly say that I really like it because of being able to do so many different workouts with only one DVD.  After reading the on-line reviews for this DVD, I can't imagine anybody complaining about the team of walkers she brings with her this time.  Get over it people!  You purchased this DVD to workout, not to judge people for whatever reason on the DVD.  Same with the critical comments about her music.  I say thank goodness it isn't the same old music on each DVD she brings us!  That would get boring.  I think she gives us a great workout in each and every day on this DVD.  You will sweat if you do the workout properly.  She has you walking anywhere from one mile to five miles on any given day.  You can even make your own workout on this DVD.  I haven't done that yet since I have not needed to change from the routines she has established.  The only thing I have to complain about on this DVD is the fact that you don't visually see how long the workouts are either on the screen or on the DVD itself (thus 4 stars).  One reviewer was kind enough to include those times in their review--Thank You!  If you want to get a good workout in the comfort of your home, this is the workout for you.

You don't really do a 2 minute boost at the end like your previous workouts, you boost like 5 minutes if not longer, but you never really jog. It is just a really really really fast pace. The moves are AMAZING & you really feel the difference after! She even adds some better cardio moves! I also LOVE the fact that you can customize your workout. Before I bought this, I didn't really understand what it meant to customize the workouts, but you can chose any of the 'color' miles, & any of the muscle workouts. The muscle workouts are great as well. It feels like about 2 or 3 minutes long & you do about 2 workouts for each section you pick to do. It's really a great DVD, my favorite.... I would encourage anybody to buy! :)",1335571200,2,901,4.213872832369942

5007874,5,B006NKFAA6,"This is one of my favorite Leslie workout DVD's to date. I've just gotten back into the habit of exercising every day. So I'm slowly working up to additional miles. Currently I'm only walking 1 mile a day. This DVD basically contains 5 separate ""1 mile"" walks. The DVD offers 5 different combinations of the walks for 5 days of the week. It also contains 5 different (separate) strength building/training exercises that each target a different core area of the body. At the end of each workout M-F you have a different core exercise along with your walking.

BUT what I LOVE about the DVD is that you can customize your OWN workout. You can combine workouts and pick out which core workout you want to do. I love it!

These walks ARE more fast-paced than the other DVD's that I have done, but I love that. It's a little different. Adds a few new moves that are easy to learn (because trust me I cannot do complicated moves!!) It's amazing how just a few simple moves can add such a challenge to these 1 mile workouts! I really love this DVD! I've been recommending it to my friends!",1335225600,3,1082,4.432160804020101

My only problem is that on 2 of the miles the audio is off and it screws me up.  During the jump rope and jumping jack session the audio is off extremely bad.  I tried it on different dvd players and then bought a second one thinking it was just mine.  Nope, it did it on both.  I'm keeping one of them because I really do like the workout but I am not very happy about the audio being off!",1335139200,,495,3.8514851485148514

The music is better on this one, but her walkers aren't the same, doesn't make it as fun as her others. I don't like how the miles get broken up, and her ""toning sessions"" last about 3 whole minutes. I do love Leslie though, and I know a lot of people comment on her chatter, but I like that. Her cheerful disposition makes it fun. On this one she doesn't talk so much, which doesn't make it as fun. But she does incorporate some new moves and you get a great workout from it.",1335139200,3,576,4.06140350877193

5007881,5,B006NKFAA6,"This may be my favorite Leslie Sansone dvd yet! There are so many options! You can create your own workout or you can follow Leslie's 5-day plan. I love the 5-day plan! It adds a little something extra - stretches, ab work, leg work, arm work, etc. But be sure you hydrate before you workout - you WILL sweat! Especially on Day 5! And you may be surprised that there is jumping rope (without the rope) and jumping jacks in the blue mile! Of course, as with all of Leslie's workouts - you get almost the same benefit if you can't do all the moves as long as you keep up the pace. But the jumping is in very short intervals (10 seconds) so you can probably do it regardless of your fitness level. That is what I love about her videos - virtually everyone can do the workouts and benefit from them. Another winner!",1334707200,2,811,4.2387096774193544
5007882,5,B006NKFAA6,I love Leslie. I was very excited that she was coming out with a DVD that was a walk plan for each day. Each day is awesome. The only thing i wish this DVD had was more time training at the end of each day. Five minutes is not enough. That is the only thing i don't like about this DVD. I love the face i can make up my own workout. That makes it even more wonderful. I have used it everyday since i got it. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!,1334707200,,425,3.7865168539325844
5007883,5,B006NKFAA6,"Great walk!!! Refreshing with a couple new moves!

I have been a big fan of Leslie's over the past 2 years and I have purchased many of her videos. I enjoy doing her last two releases because of the added moves, music, and the appearance of the set.",1334275200,,249,4.1875
5007884,5,B006NKFAA6,"I love that this video has a different program for each day of the work week.  The workouts are planned perfectly and are just enough before I start my day.  The Friday workout is the longest, which is good because then you have the weekend to recover and you can feel good about your accomplishment.  Enjoy!!",1334188800,,309,4.482142857142857
5007885,4,B006NKFAA6,"First off, I am pretty new to Leslie's workouts.  I have done a few of her dvd's so far, and I really like the newer ones because of the brighter studio, which for me helps with the atmosphere.  I really love the variety, and the fact that you can pick and choose which miles and extras you want each day, or just choose her plan for each day.  I like that she has some new moves that I hadn't seen: Jump rope, half-jacks, grapevine kickbacks, etc.  I love the different things in the blue mile especially.  You should know, however, that although this is not marketed as ""fast miles"" they are all about 12 minutes, which seems pretty fast to me.  I like it, but just wanted to let others know this.

The reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars:
I really like the dvd's where Leslie has walkers of different ages/body types.  These are all 20/30-somethings with nearly perfect bodies.  Would like to see some people in different stages of life and fitness.  Also, there is only one warm up and cool down for all workouts, and the extra workouts are very, very short at the end.",1333929600,5,1077,4.34
5007886,5,B006NKFAA6,"I really enjoy doing workout ""programs"" so this was a great fit for me. I own 5 Leslie DVD's and this one is a great addition.

PRO's:
1)Five different predetermined workouts. (Monday-Friday)  2)Customized workouts! I can choose my own custom workouts on the weekend or any day of the week. This is a new feature for Leslie. (You do NOT have to customize at all if you don't want to.)  You can choose how many miles, choose which miles you want to walk, and can add one or more toning segments. 3)Great cuing as always.  4)New music!  5)Many different variations than on her other walks!  You move around a lot more on this DVD! 6)Toning segments!  Yes, they are short, but still effective. Some toning is better than none. You can also add more toning sections each day. 7)Pretty, bright set. 8)Leslie is the same sweet, funny, chatty gal that makes working out fun and bearable.

CON's:
There are a couple nit-picky things, but not enough for me to take a star off. There is one song that is too Techno for my liking. That is a personal preference and doesn't detract from the great workout.  There is one section of the blue mile where the audio portion is off.  It is only a few seconds long, but it was not a good edit.

OBSERVATIONS:
I see some have said ""same old Leslie.""  I disagree!  Of course there are some same moves--they are the hallmark of her walking workouts!  There were many different variations and moves.  I found all of the variety made it fun and challenging.  Some have said they didn't like the new crew Leslie used.  Change is hard. I do like seeing young and young at heart in her other videos. A couple of the new crew are a bit animated/over eager. Having a new crew does not ruin this workout for me though. I think it is smart for Leslie to appeal to all ages. Lastly, some people have complained about the transitions from one mile to the next.  What I do to keep my heart rate up is either jog instead of walk or walk and keep my arms moving. It IS that simple. I would not take off a star for the transitions because it did not ruin the workout for me. There are times I like the slow down in the transitions because I am tired and need a bit of a slow down.  That is the beauty of Leslie's walks--you can lower the intensity, stay w/Leslie and her crew's intensity, or pump up the intensity.  It is all up to you.  I have really been enjoying this DVD and know it is one I won't tire of since I have so many options for customization.",1333670400,23,2470,4.291576673866091
5007887,5,B006NKFAA6,"I really like this workout by Leslie. There a few new moves and music. I like the ability to make your own workout. I also like the new walkers, but I agree she should have used women of different ages. I was tired of seeing the other walkers from her olders videos. Leslie really delivered. You get what you put into it...great cardio!",1333670400,,336,4.349206349206349
5007888,5,B006NKFAA6,"In my opinion, this is the best DVD by Leslie so far!  I have several of her DVD's and this one is different in many respects and suits my needs perfectly.  I don't have to think about what to do to workout.  There are 5 days of organized walking with one short workout targeting abs, arms, legs, back and chest and stretch daily.  No thinking involved - I just put the DVD in and do the program!

However, this is where this DVD is different from the others:  There is a separate choice menu where you CAN select different miles and different target workouts. Leslie gives an introduction in the beginning that you must listen to, as she gives instructions on how to do the selecting.  The process is easy as far as I am concerned, and I am technologically challenged.  The workout I did today lasted 50 minutes and in addition to the walking, was tailor-made to target specific areas I desired to exercise.  No matter what I choose, there is an automatic warm-up segment and a cool-down segment, with my selection(s) sandwiched in between.  The chosen segments will run automatically from one to the other, so I don't have to grab the remote and select the next one I want to do.

This is the first time that I have seen this type of option in an exercise DVD, and I own quite a few. This one works well for me. It is brand new, just released in the last month.  New studio background, new exercise participants and new music.  Since it's new, I hesitated to purchase it (""Would this be a re-run of other DVD's?""), and, as stated previously, I do have many Leslie Sansone DVD's.  But I am happy to say I am pleased that I made the purchase.",1333670400,6,1642,4.376237623762377
5007889,2,B006NKFAA6,"This is not for advanced walkers.  What you get is series of 1 mile walks that are not very challenging, Leslie does not
even break a sweat.  Save your money on this one.",1333670400,4,170,4.121212121212121
5007890,3,B006NKFAA6,"I was really looking forward to getting this DVD.  I've been wanting a five-mile walk and really like the idea of customizing it.  But if you choose the 5-mile walk, in between each mile it goes to blank screen and you have to wait for the next mile to start.  I keep walking to keep my heart rate up but then the next mile starts out slowly as if you had just started.  So the whole thing takes longer because you never get fast miles in the middle like some of her other DVD's.  Also, mine happens to skip in the blue mile so I will have to send it back and see if a replacement works better.  I do like some of the new moves she does just for a little variety.  I don't like the new walkers as much as some of her others.  I liked it when Leslie is alone or has a variety of ages and body types. The biggest reason I am disappointed with this DVD is because I feel like I get a much better workout with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-s-Walk-Slim-4-Fast-Miles/dp/B000OYCMMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone's Walk Slim: 4 Fast Miles</a>&nbsp;than with this one.  And that only takes 47 minutes for 4 miles because of the intervals of jogging (or fast walking).  This one takes about 70 minutes for the 5 miles. I like to alternate days of walking fast with days of walking with strength training (weights, stretchy bands, etc.).  This has neither so it doesn't quite fit.  I do think it would be great for beginners to customize and vary 1-, 2- or 3-mile walks.  But for just a bit more advanced (and I am definitely not super advanced), it is not as brisk as some of her other DVD's so it takes just that much longer to do 4 or 5 miles.  Guess I'll keep looking for a five-mile DVD...",1333584000,3,1755,4.547770700636943
5007891,1,B006NKFAA6,"So I been waiting on this DVD like forever. A total Flop! The execution is aweful. So she has 3 miles 4 miles 1 mile 2 miles and 5 miles. The problem is that after you finish one mile and your heart rate is up the next mile starts off slow as if you are just starting out. This is my third Leslie DVD. Her five day slim down is way better cause its five individual miles but they transition into each other meaning you just gonna go faster til five. So you can just do one or go all the way to five with your heart rate staying up. I also have her 1&2 mile which I love. Two more things. The tonining sessions or should I say what toning session....less than five mins. Last point, Leslie has a face full of make up and a snooky hump, so not cool. Glad i only paid 8 bucks. Will be selling it for 5 at my yardsale on saturday, totally a waste of money and space.",1333584000,13,862,3.903409090909091
5007892,2,B006NKFAA6,"I have been a fan of ""Walk Away The Pounds"" for a long time. I do the original 1-mile, 2-mile, and 3-mile videos when it is too hot or the weather is really bad. I have bad knees so low-impact walking is exactly what I need for my legs. I take care of the rest of my body with weights and various cardio-type workouts.

Since I know every word and step of the three videos by now, I thought maybe I'd try something new and buy this video.

Disappointment is the only word I can use. It seems to start out normally, but then about halfway through they start playing this really terrible music with an ultra-fast beat to it, and suddenly everyone is pratically RUNNING. Leslie, ""just walk"" does not mean ""run"".

Then she starts adding some terrible steps. One of them she calls ""tap"" and I guess it's from her childhood tap-dancing classes or something. Well, as a person with bad knees, she is asking for the impossible from me. There are a couple other difficult things she also does that I can't describe in words.

To put it simply, Leslie has forgotten her core audience. If we wanted to do kick-boxing or cardio-dance or P90x we would buy those videos. If she wanted to branch out to harder stuff for a different audience, then she should NOT have labeled this video ""Just Walk"". It's false advertising, and I want my money back.",1333497600,6,1333,4.428571428571429
5007893,4,B006NKFAA6,"This DVD contains an indoor walking plan for five days, from Monday to Friday.  For example, on Monday, you walk for about 46 minutes (the warm up, the 3 miles, and the cool down) and you do abdominal work for about 4 minutes, for a total workout time of just over 50 minutes.

Here's the ""5 Day Walk Plan"".

Monday (50:05)
3 mile walk (46:04)
Abs session (4:01)

Tuesday (1:02.24)
4 mile walk (59:01)
Arms session (3:23)

Wednesday (24:44)
1 mile walk (21:27)
Legs session (3:17)

Thursday (37:12)
2 mile walk (34:19)
Chest and back session (2:53)

Friday (1:14.18) This is the longest at over 1 hour and 14 minutes.
5 mile walk (1:10.45)
Full body stretch (3:33)

For long walks like on Friday, the flow is not as smooth as it should be because  each mile begins slowly and then speeds up so that when you put them together, the long walks are a little choppy.  But, I still enjoyed Ms. Sansone's personality and exuberance.

~~~

If you don't want to follow the 5 day plan, you may customize your own workouts from the 10 segments which are the foundation for the program.

Here is a time outline for the 10 segments.

Blue mile (1 mile, 12:34) Blue is the most intense of all the 1 mile workouts.
Yellow mile (1 mile, 12:21) This color & the remaining colors are of somewhat similar intensity.
Red mile (1 mile, 11:44) Each mile is roughly about 12 minutes each.
Green mile (1 mile, 12:15)
Purple mile (1 mile, 12:09) This is probably the easiest mile segment.

Abs (4:01) For me and for many others, these are very short and very easy sessions.
Arms (3:23)
Legs (3:17)
Chest/back (2:53)
Full body stretch (3:33)

All workouts have the same warm up (4:13) and the same cool down (5:29).

~~~

For those who have never done a Leslie Sansone DVD, here are the basic steps and moves.

Walking in place
Side step
Kick
Knee lift

Arm reach to the front
Arm reach to the ceiling or the sky
Arm reach to the side
Arm reach combos
Hand claps

Here are moves with a little more steps.  Many moves are familiar if have other Leslie Sansone workouts.

Hand tap to opposing leg/knee lift
Grapevine, with kick back
Mambo (easy)
Fast or power walk
Side tap, with turn, with punch
Kick back, with arm pull
Leg + foot shift, with punch
Walk to front and back
Kick with arm reach variations
Walk and tap

The blue mile includes two high impact moves.

Jump rope (rope not needed)
Half jacks (a modified version of jumping jacks)

~~~

I found the exercises in the non-walking segments very easy and quite basic.  Each segment lasts about 3 to 4 minutes.  You may combine them to do a longer workout which may still be very easy for many people. (But, I assume that Ms. Sansone is trying to help people who do not strength train, but need to do it.)

1. Abs:  At four minutes and one second, this is the longest segment.
Single leg raise
Curl up
The hundred
Single leg raise
Criss cross
Stretch

2. Arms:  This is the only segment in which you need a light pair of weights.
Biceps curl
Triceps extension

3. Legs
Back lunge
Squat
Back lunge/squat combo

4. Chest/back
Push up on knees
Modified plank with opposing leg and arm hold

5. Easy and short stretches

This DVD features four new and pleasant young ladies who walk with Ms. Sansone.
I thought the overall DVD was fine, although I do miss Linda, Jo Ann and the other walkers from the previous DVDs.  It's like missing old friends.",1333497600,306,3378,4.430894308943089

This one is great...it's a real walking workout.  I was totally sweaty after doing this one!  There is new moves & music, which if you really pay attention, are some oldies, but goodies with updated beats!!  I like the additional toning segments & you can do them at your pace and length of time.  I also like that you can make up your own workout with the different miles & toning segments, but yet you are also given a daily routine for Monday-Friday.  Keep up the good work Leslie & WAH!!",1333497600,,640,4.19672131147541

5007896,5,B006NKFAA6,"I'm not one to write reviews, but I feel compelled to review Leslie's latest DVD, as I did with her Ultimate Collection because - well, both these DVDs are excellent.  And I do love Leslie, so here goes.

I have about ten of Leslie's DVDs, and this one is going to the top of the pile.  I love it!  First off, I'm grateful to be able to create my own routine.  Miles are coded by color, so it's easy to remember which ones you prefer.  Each mile is fast paced and fun.  The music is not the best I've heard on a Leslie DVD, but it doesn't detract too much from the overall feel of the production, which is light, bright and airy.

That said, I do wish Leslie would put some more thought in her music selections.  Music is extremely important to me, and the right music can be very motivating.  There are some places in the DVD where the transitions between beats are awkward.

The walkers are gorgeous.  My preference is to see walkers of all ages and shapes, so that the rest of us can see that others, who may not be so thin and shapely, are successfully participating.  Nevertheless, the walkers in this DVD are lovely and upbeat.

Someone commented about Leslie's arms, and how they are not in shape. I don't see that at all.  Leslie always looks fabulous to me and she's a lovely woman.  She's genuine and she cares. There is not an inordinate amount of chatter on this DVD, by the way.  Yes, she says the same things over and over, but for first-timers, it's important to hear those things.

I add weights to increase the intensity, and I break out the Stretchie as well.  So it's a great workout for me.  I've been walking with Leslie for about 6 months now.

Thanks to Leslie's wonderful program, I am looking pretty good.  If I could lay off the pizelles, calzones and tiramisu, I'd be in fabulous shape for a mature woman in her 50s.  Under those extra 10 pounds are muscles I never knew I had.  I look at them from time to time in amazement.  Wow.  I have a nice waistline now.  This is ALL due to Leslie's DVDs.

I recommend this to anyone who wants to shape up fairly easily and relatively painlessly.  Leslie's program has done wonders for me and I didn't have to be a  20 pound weight carrying contortionist to get results.

I would rate this as one of Leslie's best.",1333497600,13,2282,4.311320754716981
5007897,5,B006NKFAA6,"I thought The Ultimate Challenge DVD was my favorite, but this one is now my new favorite. Yes, I liked how in the Ultimate Challenge she has older walkers, because I'm 58 and thought, if they could do it so could I. But I like this one because you can create your own combo of walks along w/abs, legs, arms etc. I don't mind the walkers a bit,The WHOLE POINT IS TO MOVE not to be friends w/the walkers. Plus, they're very energetic. I like the different moves (some of the moves I don't do because of shoulder problems, like the jumping, so I just do my favorite moves till it changes back) and I really like the faster pace. Plus, I like a good 5 mile walk. Yes she talks and repeats things, which she does in all her DVD, but I don't mind because I can easily think of other things and tune it out. And sometimes I need the reminder to ""stand up tall, shoulders back, engage your core"".
I like the generic music, which is upbeat. I agree w/another reviewer who thought some of the other reviews were rather harsh because of peripheral reasons.
I've only been doing the Sansone DVDs for about 4 months now, but I'm totally ready to get rid of my treadmill. Now THAT'S boring. I also incorporate my walks w/ her Pilates DVD, which is simple but effective.
I will definitely go back to The Ultimate Challenge to change it up when I reach my goal weight (which is getting really close now!) but I really like this scaled up version.",1333411200,3,1431,4.303703703703704
5007898,2,B006NKFAA6,"I so wanted this to be a new, interesting workout, but I am disappointed.  The same old moves with only slight variations and even the same old phrases!  I have been working out with Leslie since the 1990's.  My very first workout video was ""Basic Stepping with Walk Aerobics"".  It was great.  Bet very few people know Leslie has made 2 step videos!  But, fast forward to 2012 and she is still talking about posture and juice in the joints and how important it is to warm up.  That's what is bugging me the most, her comments never vary.  And while I'm working out, I don't want to be told what a good workout it is, I already bought it, you don't have to sell it to me!  This is the kind of thing that should be stated in an intro, not the workout that people will be doing weekly if not daily.

Having said all that,I do think her workouts are safe and effective. Most of the music is different, but there are still some of the oldies she always uses in there.  The set is different and gone are Mary Kay, Jo and Carol. I miss them. Not that the girls in this workout are in any way annoying, they are not but it's like working out with old friends when the same folks are in the workout.

I do love her positive energy but I can't listen to the same thing over and over any more.",1333411200,7,1282,4.104417670682731
5007899,5,B006NKFAA6,"I have worked out with Leslie for quite some time, and I have had nearly all her dvd's. I love the walking concept because its quick, low impact and does not really ""feel"" like exercise which is how I am able to psych myself into doing it regularly. I am in my early 30's as well, and I LOVE The bright white, vibrant fresh sets. I could not stand the old studio with the black walls, ugg. I only use the fresh set workouts now, the others are just too depressing. However I like the fact that there are new faces, and new music....who wants the same old thing all the time? There are some new moves but still mostly the classic Leslie we all know and love. I LOVE the fact that its customizable and there is a lot of variety here to change it up (which is good for those of use who workout on most days, lets face it, variety is KEY). There are 5 individual miles which you can do 1, 2, or all five, plus there are 5 short toning sessions. Overall a great mix. I get bored with the ""2 up and 2 back"" bit, and usually do squats/lunges or something during this time anyway so I like some toning mixed in. I think anyone who wants a nice low impact, effective workout would like this. Plus ladies who have been working out forever with Leslie will love it as well. Leslie is a real woman, who is aging like everyone else; maintaining her own fitness and motivating others to be positive and healthful which I think is great. She's positive, and bubbly without being fake which is rare these days. One of my all time favorite workouts is the Start! Walking, American heart association walks since Leslie is by herself. I enjoy Leslie and will probably walk with her forever!",1333411200,4,1671,4.274447949526814
5007900,5,B006NKFAA6,"I just did this dvd today and really enjoyed it!! I burned alot of calories (according to my fitbit) than I typically do with Leslie workouts. I first started doing Leslie workouts about 2 years ago when my mom introduced me. My first set was super walk dvd set that is sold on qvc. that is my favorite set, but I really enjoy all of Leslie's dvds-and i have ALOT!
What I liked about this dvd was (1) the new walkers; (2) the new music; (3) the new moves. Everything about the dvd looks updated and fresh.
Im in my late 20s/early 30s so I don't mind thinner younger walkers. I think its great that Leslie uses all kinds of walkers and all ages in her dvds. I don't think its fair for some reviewers to not like this dvd just b/c of the younger walkers. They work hard just like Leslie in the dvd, so who cares how young they are. Im glad I  never have to worry about what the walkers are wearing so that my family can be in the same room when I'm exercising.
Second, I love the updated music. Im use to her other dvds with her elevator music and talking and that has never bothered me. but Im so GLAD that this dvd has more upbeat (no words) music. I think it helped my pace more, because my husband said I seemed to be walking/moving faster than usual when I did this dvd.
Third, I love that Leslie has different moves and a way to schedule and pick your own walking program. That is so cool!!
I gave this 5 stars b/c I really enjoy this new dvd and Im always grateful when Leslie takes the time to come out with new dvds for us!
If you don't like updated walkers or music-then this DVD is NOT for you! I guess just stick with her older dvds...",1333411200,3,1645,4.0928792569659445
5007901,5,B006NKFAA6,"When I ordered this DVD I mostly wanted something which would allow me to do one different mile of strictly walking (no boosters) each weekday at lunchtime.  Unlike Leslie's other 5-miler DVDs (all of which I have and enjoy), this one automatically adds the warm-up and cool-down to the mile one chooses, making for a good workout of about 22 minutes.  Then on weekends I can mix & match the walks and the toning sessions as I wish.  A very versatile DVD.  I don't mind the music and I like seeing the younger walkers. I admire Leslie for changing formats without changing her basic product.  I have been ""walking"" with her for many years, and hope she keeps going for many years to come.",1333411200,,688,4.516129032258065
5007902,3,B006NKFAA6,"I have other DVD's of Leslie Sansone's that I enjoy and feel that I have had a good workout when I am done.  The problem with the format of this DVD is that each ""mile"" stands alone.  Esentially, she starts off each mile as a new workout, which causes the intensity to lag dramatically compared to other workouts she has done in the past.  Usually by the 3rd mile, the intensity is at its peak, but in this format I was barely breathing hard.  In theory, this ""cut and paste"" format is a great idea because you can mix up your workouts and keep things fresh, but the execution is not quite right.  I also agree with other reviews regarding the other walkers being annoying overacheivers, and even Leslie herself is a bit annoying on this video.  She never shuts up; perhaps it seems this way though because every mile is a ""new"" mile so she is compelled to explain everything about the body/posture/muscles over and over for every mile.  This one will not get a lot of use in my house.",1333324800,4,985,4.3791208791208796

8501403,5,B006NKFAA6,"This is my new favorite Leslie video.  I love how you can mix and match miles to make your own workout or pick from the different preprogrammed workouts (they range from 1-5 miles).  I personally like to walk 2 miles each day so I just mix up the different miles (which are color coded) and start walking.  Each session begins with a warm up and ends with a cool down too.  I also like this DVD doesn't have a lot of jumping around like many of her newer videos do.  Lastly, there are strength training workouts you can add to each session if you want too which include abs, arms, legs, chest & back, or full body stretch.  Total running time is 91 minutes.",1519171200,,657,4.258064516129032

8501411,5,B006NKFAA6,"I've been using Leslie Sansone's at home walk system for a long time (remember VHS tapes!).  Recently, I purchased this one and the ""Walk Blasters 10 Different Mini Walks.""  I liked the system before because of the simple moves and how easily the walk could be modified to your fitness level.  With the newer DVDs, I love the system because you still have the benefits of the original walking plan, but can now follow the day to day plan, or use the walk that fits your schedule that day. I don't get bored because I have a different walk each day!  It's a great ""no excuses"" workout for me!",1497571200,,591,4.394495412844036
