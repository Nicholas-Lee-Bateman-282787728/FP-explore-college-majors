3906442,5,B002CMGO5O,Incredibly inspiring.  It shows us that even the most ordinary of us can attain  heroism when the need arises.  I bought 2 copies to give to friends. She was definitely robbed  of a Nobel Peace Prize.,1254355200,6,200,4.472222222222222
3906443,5,B002CMGO5O,"I thought this was a great movie, especially since it was a true story. We need more movies like this.",1252886400,4,102,4.15
3906444,5,B002CMGO5O,"This is a moving, heartwarming movie!  This self-sacrificing woman toiled relentlessly to rescue all these children and then afterward worked to reunite them with their families.  At first, you are concerned that she will be found out and her actions stopped before she could accomplish her tasks.  Then you realize her dedication, focus, determination, and dedication will triumph against all tyranny and oppression.  She is so deserving of honor and praise for her heroic acts all of which could have caused her death not just the torture she was subjected to.  She should not have been just nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, she should have received it.  In comparing her sacrifices and those of Al Gore, he should be ashamed that he was given the award.  She truly earned it.",1250380800,12,782,4.923664122137405
3906445,5,B002CMGO5O,Al Gore should be required to give back the Nobel Peace Prize and it should be awarded to Irena. This is an excellent movie.,1249171200,73,124,4.208333333333333
3906446,5,B002CMGO5O,"This is a touching and wonderful true story.  The first time I saw it on TV I had to have the DVD.  It is amazing what Sendler did to save so many children during WWII, yet few have heard this story.  Sendler touched so many lives.  She died only a couple of years ago at the age of 98.  The story of what she did was only discovered a few years before she died by some students in a Kansas school.  Everything about Sendler's life is absolutely amazing.",1246406400,180,454,4.1022727272727275

3906453,1,B002CMGO5O,"Lots of fictional expansion on the imaginations of people who (since WWII) have thought to themselves ""How could things have gone this situation?"" I've heard too many stories about diamonds being digested and crapped out, some wench secreting kids out of Warsaw in her ""tool box"" a skinny boy jumping from the Auschwitz chimney (that didn't exist until the USSR built it in the 1950s) and apples being thrown to a boy who later married the girl who gave them to him - only to find out it was a deliberate fiction.

I have to know stories like Irene Sendler are somehow ""real"" instead of heart string-tugging fiction like Schindler's List before I lend it any credence. NO, I will not take it on a leap of faith like most.",1502236800,,721,4.546153846153846

3906460,4,B002CMGO5O,This was the first time I've heard of Irena Sendler after a friend of mine told me a story about her. I decided to buy the movie in order to the historical background of Sendler. I was very satisfied with the movie and I have shown the movie to friends and relatives.,1493251200,,267,4.153846153846154
3906461,5,B002CMGO5O,A true hero - a young Polish woman who risks her life taking children out of the ghetto and finding them homes with Catholic families during WWII . Excellent true story... remarkable story !,1491696000,,190,4.617647058823529

3906465,5,B002CMGO5O,"A well done drama that strives to recreate the crime of the holocaust negleting only the emaceation of the people living in the ghetto; of coarse the could not ask the actors and extras to starve. Anna. Paquin performed very well reflecting the seriousness and humanity of the woman,  Irena Sendler who was determined to rescue the youngest of the victims from the Nazi atrocity.
  Veiwers with a human soul are advised to keep a box of tissue near by because this story will touch you. Feel assured if you can weep at the travisty of human cruelty thar hope is with us.",1487289600,,570,4.514563106796117

3906467,5,B002CMGO5O,"An extraordinary movie about a remarkable woman.  If you enjoy movies and books about individuals who rise above their circumstances this is sure to be a pleaser.  From what I understand, this movie is also quite factual with the exception of the love story (but this was just a minor theme in the movie).

Through God's blessing, it seems that compassionate people have been placed in a particular era amidst crises to accomplish great things. In encouraging a young Jewish boy to escape the Warsaw ghetto while he still could, Irena tells him that the future will need his compassion.  Most of use will not rescue thousands of children or accomplish great and noble causes but we can each do our part where it is needed most in the time in which we live.  Highly recommend.",1484092800,8,775,4.669117647058823

I wanted to go beyond Anne Frank and show what other people were doing to take action during WWII and the amazing story this told. The kids LOVED it was true and we ended up doing more research on her. Also, it was a great tie in to History Day - to think that is how she was even acknowledged - made my students really stop and think. I also had quite a few students ask to take it home for their parents to watch with them, and all who did wrote me a personal note to tell me thank you for showing their children another side of WWII and humanity.

3906508,2,B002CMGO5O,"Not as good as other movies about similar stories of WWII heroism.  It took too long to say too little.  Too many scenes showing the same basic things happening and not enough other info to fill out her story.  Didn't show her spiritual motivations or the rich spiritual life of the Polish Christians helping her.  The scenes of Jews worshipping were quite moving, but, without scenes showing Sandler's or other collaborator's spirituality, it seemed as if everyone else was secular.  Yet Sandler was a devout Catholic.  Except for a couple scenes in which she talks to a priest collaborator, you'd never even know.  It also was scanty on details of how their network of support functioned.  I thought the acting was ok but not great, and Ms. Paquin's accent labored and inconsistent. Couldn't they have found a Polish actress - or just skipped the accents?  Having said all that, it's an interesting story and worth seeing.  However, I'd recommend you borrow it or rent it rather than buy it!",1457222400,3,993,4.822485207100592

3906529,3,B002CMGO5O,The story is wonderful.  The PBS special however on Irena Sendler is much more informative and overall better in my view.  Major events like the burning of the ghetto and the Jewish resistance fighters were left out of Courageous Heart.  There were approximately 200 Convents that hid these children in Poland and that was not noted.  There were Polish gangsters who extorted money from the families that were hiding Jews.  These gangsters were not mentioned in Courageous Heart.  Courageous Heart does not make it clear that train loads of 2000 Jews were being taken on a daily basis but this information is in the PBS movie.  The PBS movie also shows the level of starvation in the ghetto and interviews several adults who had been hidden children.  The way the names were hidden in Courageous Heart is contradictory to Irena Sendler's personal description which we can hear in the PBS movie.  Overall Courageous Heart falls short of the very informative PBS documentary movie.,1446076800,6,979,4.957055214723926

3906547,5,B002CMGO5O,"Polish Social Worker, Irena Sendler, is a hero of history's past when WWII dominated with violence and destruction.
The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler is a film about her life and how she risked her own life to help Jewish children escape ghettos during the war.
Her story is definitely one of courage and fearless determination to help children trapped and doomed to a most certain death. It is not an easy movie to watch as it displays the horrors of war but it is very worth watching for the story portrayed.
One of the unique strategies of Irena Sendler was to preserve the true identities of the Jewish children she helped escape by hiding their given names/identity on strips of paper placed in jars. The jars were then buried and to be found after the war was over. She understood the importance of maintaining the true identities of the children for posterity.
Her story is one that captures the selfless acts of one for the sake of many and it gives a glimpse into the heart of a true hero who's memory is worth remembering.
The acting is fine and the movie is made well.
A captivating movie. Highly recommended.",1436832000,2,1124,4.597014925373134

We need to NEVER FORGET the evil of fascism, socialism, Marxism, communism, totalitarianism, progressiveism, globalism, statism and the rest.  If we do, we let it slip into our culture and change the country, such as is happening right now.  The Trans Pacific Partnership, TPP, TPA, TAA trade agreements (look them up) before Congress right now, is a result of that, and we have politicians who are poised to create an authority, an unelected international governing body, to sell us out to an EU style world government if they pass it.  Obama (how a  Marxist got elected is beyond me-people just didn't do their research) wants it desperately so he'll be given more power.

- Why were some Jewish families reluctant to save their children?
- Where did Irena place the Jewish children?
- How many did she successfully place?
- Where did Irena get the money to buy food for the children--initially, and then later?
- What two attributes (one physical, one textual) helped Irena avoid suspicion for so long--in comparison with a hypothetical person named Ireneusz Sadowski?
- What claim or rumor did the Nazis use to discourage medical or other assistance to Jews in the ghetto?
- What organization helped Irena?
- What risk did involvement with that organization bring?
- Why were girls like Irena living with Jewish families in the first place?  (This isn't specific in the movie.  If you can't guess, read the book by Leon Wells called ""Shattered Faith: A Holocaust Legacy."")
- What was the Catholic Church's response to Irena's situation?
- Irena's children had to fool the Nazis, but did they fool Poles too?  Did they need to?  Could they even if they tried?  (This isn't specific in the movie, but consider the fact that in Poland at that time, Jewish children's first language was typically Yiddish, and perhaps then Hebrew.  The children would eventually learn Polish, but how would it sound?)
- What did Irena's involvement with Jews eventually lead to, after the war?",1424044800,2,1505,4.783783783783784

3906614,5,B002CMGO5O,"I've always been interested in the Holocaust, because I'm an activist for women's and GLBT rights and equality. I see certain pundits and politicians of the right-wing who are using exactly the same formula that Hitler used to get an entire population to accept the dehumanization of certain groups of people. Sendler risked her own life to get Jewish children out of Warsaw as they were being rounded up for the death camps, a story I had never heard about. I find it fascinating that so many 'good Germans' were so thoroughly brainwashed against their friends and neighbors that they happily participated in helping the Germans put every Jew and other 'sub-human' or 'non-Aryan' into railroad cars to be sent to their deaths. When I see the pundits of Fixed Noise refer to those they dislike as 'rag-heads' for Muslims, use every insult for blacks except the N-word to disrespect the President and encourage their unbalanced viewers to commit acts of violence upon whomever they have targeted as an 'acceptable' target, I see the voices and faces of hatred and bigotry that were so prevalent in Hitler's day. When Bill O'Reilly used the term ""Tiller the Killer"" to describe a women's clinic doctor over a several week period because he personally is against a woman's right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, until finally one of the fanatics that obeys the orders coming out of the television hunted down Dr. Tiller and shot him---in church---there is absolutely no difference between brainwashing  against doctors who perform abortions by the right-wing and the brainwashing of the German people by Hitler and his henchmen until virtually every non-Jew in Berlin and the big cities in Germany got whatever weapons they could muster, from guns to knives to machetes to clubs and went out in the street, demolishing every Jewish-owned business they could find and beating, stabbing, shooting, and killing with their bare hands every Jewish man, woman, or child that they could find. ""Those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it."" Santayana  It's too bad that our non-functional education system fails to teach students the end result of hatred and bigotry. American children should learn about the Holocaust all throughout their public education so they know what can handle if they allow themselves to be brainwashed into fear of and hatred toward any ethnic, religious, economic, gender-oriented, or racial group. If they allow themselves to be conned into thinking that men are better than women or Christians are better than Jews or Muslims or atheists, or white people are smarter, better, and should have the right to own members of other races, then the kind of behavior displayed in Germany and Poland during the war can----AND WILL---begin again.",1398470400,2,2773,5.0524017467248905

3906643,5,B002CMGO5O,"Beautiful, realistic, gritty, and atypical Hallmark(!) Hall of Fame Presentation. This film by the talented TV director John Kent Harrison (of the ""Pope John Paul II"" CBS miniseries with Jon Voight) tells the true life story of Irena Sendler, a righteous gentile who risked her life to save Jews during the Holocaust. As a Polish Catholic social worker in Warsaw, Sendler oversaw a massive effort to smuggle Jewish children out of the ghetto and into adoptive Christian families during the German occupation of Poland during WWII. She hoped to reunite them with their true families (any that survived) after the war. Powerful but emotionally subtle, this film avoids all hint of melodrama and pandering, never striking a false note. Sendler died just a few years ago, right after being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize won by Barack Obama. It's a rare gem.",1381536000,7,859,5.013986013986014

While the movie does not depict the more graphic details of the Holocaust, it does show the pathos and pain of families torn apart, the anguish of the parents and the bewilderment and terror of the children.
Sendler succeeded in smuggling  approximately 2,500 Jewish children to safety. She was part of the rescue network called Zegota which existed to rescue Jews from the Nazi clutches
she was however caught by the Nazis and horrifically tortured , before being released by a German guard who had been bribed by the Polish underground.

The cameras follow Anna Paquin for the majority of footage and she does a great job of portraying the Polish hero as do the other actors in the minor roles.  Shot in an historic Latvian town, the setting looks pretty authentic to old photos of Polish towns in that era, as do the vehicles and clothing. If I was being critical I'd say the clothing especially in the ghettos was a bit clean and new looking but this was a made for TV movie after all.

It gets more into the venturing through the putrid sewers and living there and that sort of experience from the Jewish people's point of view than A Courageous Heart does which concentrates more on Irena. Both are good films, just concentrating on different perspectives.

The DVD version (sold in Australia anyway you might want to check) comes with a pretty interesting documentary on making the film and teaching the fake made up accent to Anna (who's a New Zealander) and all the other actors.

During World War Two, this selfless, generous woman rescued countless Jewish children from certain death by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland and finding them safe homes with Polish families and also convents and orphanages.

Irena is credibly portrayed by Anna Paquin who shines in her role as the devout and determined social worker/ administrator at a hospital who by virtue of her position is able to enter the Warsaw Ghetto and administer medical services. When Irena witnesses the terrible suffering of the Jewish people trapped in the ghetto, she decides to do all she can to at least save the children, the innocents who were frequently targeted for immediate extermination upon arrival at the death camps like Auschwitz.

Knowing full well that the punishment for helping Jews escape is almost certain death, Irena, together with the help of several loyal colleagues and those working in the Polish Underground manage to save at least 2,500 Jewish children. The number may seem staggering and even unbelievable to some, but bear in mind that the Warsaw Ghetto at capacity had around 400,000 residents crammed into it by the Nazis so 2,500 Jewish children is only a drop in the ocean compared to the vast numbers transported to their deaths. However, the fact that Irena and like-minded people risked their lives to save these children is an incredible feat in itself.

The scenes where Irena is given the children by desperate parents are harrowing, and I could only imagine how those parents must have felt like, knowing that giving up their children may be the only way to ensure their survival. There are many heart-stopping moments in this film, and even gruesome torture scenes, but these things really happened, during a dark time when evil manifested itself in the form of the Third Reich.

3906689,5,B002CMGO5O,"Based on my long-term studies of the Holocaust, I conclude that this movie depiction of Irena Sendler is close to the actual historical events. WARNING: Some of the scenes in the movie are emotionally intense, and may be upsetting to sensitive viewers.

German propaganda had attempted to convince the Poles that the Jews were being locked up in ghettos in order to protect the Polish population from the typhus borne by Jews. For a long time, Jews had thought of the Germans as a very civilized people, for whom mass extermination of peoples would have been unthinkable. Warsaw's Jews deluded themselves into thinking that Warsaw's nearly 500,000-strong Jewish community was too large to be harmed by the Nazis. Then, for a long time, too many Jews had accepted the Germans' ""resettlement"" claims at face value.

Irena's Sendler's offer of help was not all that well received. Many Jewish leaders thought that, since Jews had survived persecutions before, they could do so again, and do it without aid from the Poles. Furthermore, many Jewish parents did not want their children raised by Poles, if only out of the fear that they would, through deliberate acts or passive influences, convert to Christianity. Some Jews thought that the risk of their children converting to Christianity was equivalent in outcome to the risk of dying, while other Jews disagreed with this notion. Then of course it was difficult for parents to voluntarily part with children in the hope that they would survive the war.

Successfully placing Jewish children in Polish homes was very difficult because the Jewish children had to be smuggled out of the ghetto. In addition, Jews did not fit into Polish society. Poland's Jews mostly spoke Yiddish and had a weak understanding of Polish, if that. Poles faced the death penalty for the slightest aid to Jews. In spite of all this, Irena Sendler managed to save 2,500 Jewish children before falling into the hands of the Gestapo. She was repeatedly tortured, and then only a well-placed bribe by the Polish Underground, directed at a corrupt German individual, snatched her in the last minute from the jaws of the executioners.

[It is not true, as asserted by one reviewer, that Polish nationalists (Endeks, the followers of Roman Dmowski) opposed helping Jews. In fact, the one-of-a-kind ZEGOTA aid organization, of which Irena Sendler was a member, contained Poles of all political persuasions, including the Endeks. Members of even the more extreme nationalist ONR also were involved in helping Jews, whether or not they personally had changed their prewar anti-Jewish positions.]",1285372800,109,2612,5.095794392523365

3906691,3,B002CMGO5O,"Hallmark's ""The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler,"" which first aired on CBS on April 19, 2009, does a good job presenting the story of Irena Sendler and Zegota. Very few people are aware of the Council to Aid Jews (code name: Zegota), the Polish underground organization which assisted Jews during the Nazi occupation. It's estimated Zegota saved 4,000 Jews, mainly in the Warsaw area. Irena Sendler (Sendlerowa), the focus of this film, headed the organization's children's section and was responsible for saving the lives of 2,500 Jewish children.

Not all Polish Catholics were interested in assisting Jews. Anti-Semitism was pervasive in Poland prior to the war and continued into the occupation. One of the four political parties which comprised the Polish underground Delegatura, the National Party representing conservative Catholics, refused to support Zegota in any way. It was only until the spring of 1944, when it was already too late, that the Polish Government-in-exile began supporting Zegota with any seriousness. Despite lack of funding and support, the brave and selfless individuals who comprised Zegota carried on with their mission in the face of tremendous danger to their own personal safety.

Anna Pacquin gives a gritty performance as the determined Sendler, although she does seem to play only one note throughout. While this movie was shot in Latvia, Polish film buffs will recognize a number of Polish actors in the cast including the incomparable Danuta Stenka. To its credit, the film does touch upon the anti-Semitic attitudes of some Poles. This is a Hallmark, made-for-television movie so don't expect the large budget accouterments of a theatrical release. That being said, ""The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler"" is both entertaining and informative. A five-star-film? No. But a worthwhile effort. Kudos to Hallmark for bringing the heroic story of Sendler and Zegota to the American general public.",1275955200,90,1935,5.3618421052631575

3906693,5,B002CMGO5O,"This was a great movie about the Holocaust era.  Although it had to depict the trauma of folks giving their children away in order to save/protect them, it also showed how much difference a few compassionate people could make in the lives of others.  Very uplifting.",1268092800,5,266,4.760869565217392

3906696,5,B002CMGO5O,"This is not a feel good movie nor is it based on fanstasy. A disturbing movie that showed an evil that did exist. The movie is based on the reality of a culture showing cruelty to another culture as it tries to obliterate and edradicate it. Holocaust to me is a generalized term that lacks details. This movie, without being gory, shows the emotional upheavel, fear, trama, bravery, cunning, courage, and heart rending details of a people, family and culture in the midst of being destroyed. This movie shows the gates of hell trying to prevail against a people because they were convenient scapegoats. Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler and Schindler's List tell of the horrors of that time.

  Anna Paquin, as a child actor, was adorable in Fly Away Home. Anna is a grown up adult now and did well in the movie. But admirable credit should also go to the supporting cast members, especially the women who show courage and inner strength in looking out for their families.

  Rebecca Windheim is excellent as an effervescent girl coming of age trying to make sense of the intense wicked persecution against her, her family and her people. In the bonus materials I found refreshing the interview of Rebecca and her father Sol Windheim. Sol spoke of immediate family members who were in concentration camps and didn't survive. Maybe he was just grateful his daughter had a part in the movie, but there seemed to be no trace of bitterness in his voice from the experience his family suffered under. He said he was honored that his daughter was in the movie and be the voice of his family that didn't make it out.

  Too bad the book, The Mother of the Holocaust Children, the movie is based on seems to be out of print. It would have been good and said a lot if Irena received the Nobel Peace Prize she was nominated for.",1262908800,11,1818,4.58641975308642
3906697,5,B002CMGO5O,"I agree with all the other reviewers.  This is a great story, a well done movie, and what a pity indeed the nobel peace prize was not awarded to Irena.  The fact that she lived to 98 is remarkable; as well as the students who brought this story to light.  Only one complaint - there are no subtitles.  For such a great,true story, it is a shame that it is not offered in other languages.  The closed caption on my DVD did not work.  This was disappointing because 1) I ordered this especially for my deaf father; and 2) even for those who are not hearing-impaired there are some scenes where the speech is so low it's hard to hear/understand what is being said.",1262563200,11,661,4.290322580645161

3906700,5,B002CMGO5O,"This film tells the compelling story of Polish Catholic social worker, Irena Sendler, in the early 1940s. She engineered and operated a group of compatriots who moved in and out of Warsaw's Jewish Ghetto dressed as nurses employed by Warsaw's Health Department. Even as they worked under the ruse of attempting to prevent and contain the spread of Typhus and Spotted Fever, Sendler and her brave friends emerged each time with the children of consenting Jewish parents. The children were sometimes medicated and concealed in boxes, suitcases and coffins as a means of rescuing them from their imminent deportation to death camps. They were given new identities and placed with Polish families, ophanages, schools, and convents to protect their safety. Sendler kept a hidden record of their birth names and where they were placed with the hope that they would some day be reunited with their own families.

Hallmark continues to be a wonderful source of inspiration and tells of the stories of heartfelt, caring individuals that risked their lives to succeed in what they beleived was right to save the most innocent of souls.",1255478400,321,1125,5.081081081081081

After reading the book and then watching the movie, I was very disappointed in the movie.  The movie gives you so little of the background of the story  and explain to the viewer what this very courageous Polish woman, along with other people, did to save over 2,500 Jewish children in getting them out of the ghetto to safety.  If you are interested in the story of the Warsaw Ghetto, you would love the book Irena's Children.  I would pass on the this movie.",1526947200,,598,4.4907407407407405
