I read the other reviews and I thought people have to be warned about this dvd,it's soooo bad. It's like watching an old vhs tape on a vcr with dirty heads. The price for this cheap but it's still overpriced. Do yourself a favor stay away from this disc.",1338595200,9,344,4.0
8502307,2,B006OT0U8S,"This has to be the worst quality of any dvd i've ever seen, and I own over 2000 of them. Flesh Feast is unwatchable, you can barely tell what's going on in the movie. Three on a Meathook has some good moments and the picture is slightly better then Flesh Feast. I'd avoid this set because of the picture, it's so bad.",1334966400,15,317,4.129032258064516
8502308,1,B006OT0U8S,"I was so excited when I learned that the film, 3 On A Meathook was finally getting an official release on DVD, but my excitement turned to bitter disappointment and then total freakin' anger shortly after I pushed play on my DVD player. The picture quality is beyond terrible. Not only is the transfer taken directly from an old VHS release, it is taken from an ultra-grainy copy that looks as if it had been previously viewed a few hundred times. In fact, it looks like an old bootleg you might have ordered from Midnight Video or Video Search of Miami. There are a few spots where the screen goes momentarily black and the video rolls and re-tracks.

The ""company"" that put this travesty out is called, Grind Global Media, but when I did a Google search, no company information can be found, just sites that are selling this piece of garbage.

The second strike against this DVD is the other feature, Veronica Lake's last film, Flesh Feast; it looks even worse than 3 On A Meathook. It was, also, obviously copied from an old video release but Grind Global Media's version is missing about five minutes of footage.

I own the original VHS releases of both of these films and I can promise anyone reading this review that the original video tapes are far superior in picture and sound quality than the copies the criminals at Grind Global Media are hawking.

It is a shame that companies like Grind Global Media, Cheezy Flicks and CFS Releasing are allowed to sell their junk on Amazon. 3 On A Meathook is a classic drive-in film and this horrible DVD release literally ruins any enjoyment you may have gotten from watching it. Please save your money until a legitimate company releases it or try and find the original Regal Video VHS on Ebay.

You have been warned.",1333497600,37,1767,4.5968253968253965

Both of these movies are tediously bad ,but I could tell that there might have been potential for a few laughs,had I been able to actually view anything on screen! The material used for transfer is god awful! Washed out and faded! Played out crappy VHS tapes stored in the worse conditions are my guess is what they used when they put this garbage on DVD.Total rip off! One big red and orange blur is all I could make out! I have already returned this rip off back to seller! Don't let the cover artwork fool you into thinking your going to have any fun with purchasing this dissapointing product!",1333411200,29,660,4.373983739837398
