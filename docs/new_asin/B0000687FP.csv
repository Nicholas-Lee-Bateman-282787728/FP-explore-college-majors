This is a good movie on the Chinese Crane style of Kung fu.  I studied Crane style in NYC's Chinatown for a brief while and although the actual techniques are not demonstrated fully Bruce Liang or his teacher, you do get the essence of the style -matched with a different bird style that is often overlooked and ignored by many Chinese martial artist.",1423612800,,527,4.377551020408164

I was raised in the theaters watching Bruce Lee movies and we use to go downtown and watch movies like 'Enter the Dragon' with one of these as the co-hit. I was always impressed by Yang Sze and first seen 'Chinese hercules' as a co-hit with 'The return of the dragon'. The name it was first released in the U.S. originally called 'Way of the dragon' da.
We all laughed our asses off by the soundtrack and dub but years later found myself buying these video's and now the DVD's.
I think it is a 'reliving the past' kind of thing. So now I started collecting everything I could find of Yang Sze.
I must of seen this movie already 40 times and still love it. Unfortunately I have been watching it in the 4:3 mode all this time until today which to my surprize is in the full pixel 16:9 mode. The commentary as someone here pointed out is hard to get to. You have to mess with it a bunch of times before you can get it to play.
This is also my first Bruce Liang movie.
Looks like this movie has already gone way up in price due to being out of print now. If you are a serious collector of 'Yang Sze' you gotta get this. You also need to be someone that grew up in the 'Bruce Lee' days back in the early 70's to really appreciate this.",1289606400,2,1281,4.067193675889328
