7847644,3,6303465854,"The feature films of British turned American director Kevin Connor (who has mostly worked in TV) has always been something of a crap shoot. You win some and you lose some. Among the losers are the 3 Edgar Rice Burroughs films (AT THE EARTH'S CORE/LAND THAT TIME FORGOT/PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT), DOMESTIC IMPORT, and ARABIAN ADVENTURE. Among the winners are FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE, WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS, MOTEL HELL, THE HOUSE WHERE EVIL DWELLS, and this film which came as something of a surprise. I had never heard of it and ran across it on Netflix while referencing something else. The trailer was not very promising and the brief synopsis was standard but since Connor's movies are a guilty pleasure of mine, I had to check it out. Turns out that it was well worthwhile but unless you're tuned in to Connor's particular sense of humor and low budget style of filmmaking then it may not appeal to you (as seems to be the case with most other reviewers).

Peter Weller (ROBOCOP) plays a down and out alcoholic detective in East L.A. who's estranged from his wife (Alexandra Paul) and reduced to doing cheap infidelity surveillance work. When his wife is murdered he is drawn into a complicated scheme involving disappearing illegal aliens, organ transplants, and foundation payoffs. After getting no help from his police friend (Michael Anderson Jr) he turns to the illegal immigrants themselves to get the goods on a wealthy businessman (Stacy Keach). The lighting is tawdry, the camerawork and direction are efficient, and the editing is erratic (unrated material may have been added later) but the script is interesting and the performances are solid if somewhat unspectacular. Keach's rationale speech at the end is positively jaw dropping and rivals Patrick O'Neal's in the original STEPFORD WIVES. Not a great movie by any means but a surprisingly engaging one if you just go with the flow. Look for Danny Trejo (SPY KIDS, MACHETE) in a small role near the beginning.",1387670400,,1973,4.924924924924925

7847649,2,6303465854,"The ""hero"" of this crime movie is a foul-mouthed, beat-up, cigarette-always-hanging-out-of-the-mouth, booze-guzzling, bug-eating, cop-turned-low-life-P.I., played by Peter Weller. The character is supposedly redeemed by his basic honesty, feelings toward his wife, and rapport with the down-and-out.

Weller's character is estranged from his wife, played by Alexandra Paul in a couple of brief and shallow scenes. This is in part because as a cop he unwittingly set up a sting on her father concerning a savings-and-loan fraud, which appears to have led the man to hang himself. The wife owns a seedy-neighborhood Southern California bar and grill, which has some employees from south of the border.

The movie begins with a confusing and violent scene in Mexico, in which one man is shot in the head and the face of another (an employee of the bar and grill, I think) is crushed by hand by a tall, burly blonde henchman. When the thugs come looking for a letter that the employee might have sent back to the grill, Weller's wife meets the same fate.

At the bottom of it all is what turns out to be some weird organ harvesting scheme using illegal Mexican immigrants. Just about everyone in the movie seems to have been involved somehow in this ill-defined, gruesome plot. This includes: Stacy Keach, hamming it up as drawling rich guy Shelgrove, who lives in a mansion, owns a firing range that seems to double as a bar, and gives lengthy expositions on Mayan culture; Lori Singer, as the stereotypical breathy-voiced, brooding blonde knockout, at one moment politely business-like, at another a steamy seductress, and at the next cool-and-hard-as-nails, who apparently manages Shelgrove's shooting range and has sometime in the past been an organ recipient (though nothing about this character, or her relationship to anyone else, is made clear); John Rhys Davies as a wholly corrupt, abusive INS agent; a sweaty, neurotic surgeon; Weller's utterly ineffectual cop pal who courted his wife; and even Weller's deceased father-in-law, who took an interest in Mexican immigrants.

There is some mystery and detection, the cast includes some recognizable names, and Weller and Keach are passable. But no one is displayed to good effect. The characters, story, and settings are thin, murky, ugly, and uninvolving. As it unfolds, the story is choppy and obscure, not crisp and dramatic. Despite the grim subject matter, the movie has an incongruous tongue-in-cheek feel, for example, in how in how it presents Weller, Rhys Davis, Shelgrove, and the doctor.

Weller's uncanny ability, while mumbling and shambling along, to keep going through all the smoke, booze, bruises, bullets, complications, and adversaries to get to the bottom of it all is increasingly implausible. A prime example is the scene in which Weller, wounded, drugged senseless, and lying on the doctor's operating table (and why would the bad guys go through this trouble instead of just shooting or strangling him, as they do to everyone else?), pulls himself up, stumbles away, and fights the blonde muscle man to the death.

The movie's way of resolving everything is to kill off characters (good and bad) in one brutal manner or another, including, most wastefully, a female INS agent. Its overall ugliness seems to be done for cheap shock-effect rather than to convey any larger meaning, its style a substitute for telling a clear, full, and effective story. Some gratuitous nudity and tasteless ""comic relief,"" thrown in for good measure, do not help.

Other reviews have rightly pegged Weller's character as a ""stumblebum with a BB gun"" and the movie as a ""muddled tale of slobs and sex."" This is an unpleasant, confusing, poorly developed, unsatisfying movie.",1184112000,4,3733,5.160330578512396
7847650,1,6303465854,"Time to review the 1992 crime drama ""Sunset Grill"" starring Peter Weller and Lori Sanger.  The letterbox states, ""For years private eye Ryder Hart lived on the edge.  Tonight he'll cross the line.""

Well...Ryder (Weller) crosses the line and in the process we're all witnesses to one of the most boring crime flicks on Planet Earth.

Peter Weller walks around for 90 minutes beat-up, bruised and bleeding like a mutt that's just been run over by a semi.

Lori Sanger looks like a wax mannequin at Tussaud's House of Horrors and her acting could be recreated in any viable sound software program.

Grill this one at sunset.  I mean (to get to the point)...take the DVD and throw it into your barbecue grill as a flame starter.

Peter, whom I admired prior to this embarrassment, is no longer a ""Weller"" in my book...he's now a ""Worser"".",1078790400,6,835,4.671232876712328
