2311484,1,B0009PW4D2,"I thought this movie was a put-on for the first few minutes, then I realized it was actually as bad as it seemed.  I paid very little for it and it still cost too much.  The acting is what you might expect from a fourth-grade class doing their first run-through of the school play.  This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen.",1118188800,18,331,4.222222222222222
2311485,1,B0009PW4D2,"I also found the DVD at Wal-Mart for < $9 USD prior to its scheduled release.  Note ""the DVD"" rather than ""my DVD"" as it won't be kept long.  On the disk itself is the phrase ""Guaranteed Superior Quality.""  Not so.  Perfect fodder for the late Mystery Science Theater 3000.

The CGI is at best early to mid 1980s.  See the execrable Thunderchild sequence and the Martian exsanguination of a rather crudely constructed cow (mooing sounds were added apparently so you'd know what you're looking at.)  Rather don't see them.

Thespians: everyone gets to have at least one reaction shot per event, perhaps more.  'Horror' is shown by squinting and showing one's teeth.  IMDb tells me few of the actors have appeared in other films.  Those who have inhabited characters named 'bikini girl' and 'sweater girl.'  Whatever talents they had in those roles did not transfer to this film.  The scenery-chewing actor playing the curate will soon be seen in ""Creatures from the Pink Lagoon.""  The artilleryman's role, important in the book,  is a complete waste.

Filmic style: daytime is orange, night is pale blue - except when they don't use the filters.  No other reviewers have mentioned the jerkiness of movement or green screen induced fuzziness around women's hair.  Wish they'd have used my ancient 'Classics Illustrated' version as a guide for design and brevity.

This three hour behemoth is an acting, directing, CGI, editing, and camerawork mess.  Wish I could give it a negative number of stars.  Shame on Amazon for deleting the initial reviews.  Guys, you might find your earlier review in a Google cache, I did.  New readers beware glowing reviews planted by Pendragon (production company) hirelings.

2311487,1,B0009PW4D2,"Mere words cannot describe the orgasmic joy that raced through me after watching Timothy Heinz's semenal retelling of Mr. H.G. Well's classic science fiction novel WARS OF THE WORLDS.

I feel I simply must express my deepest, most sincerest gratitude to Mr. Heinz and his fine company for making this viewer's life just a little more worth living with their wonderful motion picture event for the ages. That such unbridled excitement can be had for a mere $8.42 at Wal-Mart, that bastion of American ingenuity, FAIR employment practises (take THAT, Robert Greenwald!) and good old wholesome Christian goodness, further cements Mr. Heinz's reputation, at least in my eyes, as a man of vision, faith and enormous entrepreneurial resolve. I for one cannot wait for the next release from Snapdragon Pictures.

But on to the film itself.

With a remarkable sense of realism and an masterful command of the cinematic language unheard of since the days of Cecily DeMille or W.D. Griffins or Charlie Chapman, Heinz deftly transports us back to a time and place that we can only imagine in our inferior minds - Pennsylvania, 1898, where a cast of thousands in their Civil War-era finery are subjected to a terrifying invasion of gigantic mechadroidal spider monsters that lay waste to much of Pittsburgh, including Big Ben!! Sweet Christ on a feathery cloud this movie is fantastic! And the acting, well, don't get me started or Amazon might be forced remove my privileges for unauthorized use of praise! (Ha Ha.  Ha.). Suffice it to say that Tony Piano is ideal as the Main Character, ably switching from a sort of lethargic trance-like condition (totally in keeping with the scepticism of his character) to super heroics that would make John-Claud Vandam hang up his numb-chucks within a single sequence! Truly an acting legend has been born in this film. Mark my words, we'll be hearing a lot more from Mr. Piano down the road. And let us not forget the lovely Jamie Lynn Cease as the ravishing Miss Elfinsteen. What I wouldn't give to put a tap on that and sell it to the world, if you know what I mean. Wait a minute, what DO you think I mean. How DARE you, you heathen sinners.

I've read that TIMOTHY WELLES' WARS OF THE WORLDS cost OVER $175,000 TO MAKE! That's a lot of money, and I can assure you, every penny of it is up on the screen. The special effects in this film, despite the obviously planted naysayers here on Amazon, are some of the finest work I've seen since TV's Harry Thomason graced us with THE DAY IT CAME TO EARTH way, waaay back in 1979 (why I can remember seeing that one at the Starlight Drive In out on the one-oh-five). Hasn't been a decent special-effects driven film since then, I say. In fact, not since THE PASSIONS OF MR. JESUS or LEFT BEHIND II: TRIBULATION FORCE has a movie left me so emotionally drained yet charged with a renewed enthusiasm to confront this hellish liberal cesspool that plagues these end of times! Praise Timmy Heinz! Praise!

This is truly a film for our troubled times, based on a book for our troubled times, except it was for our troubled times back then, and they were less troubled back then than they are now, let me tell you! There's a potent subtext at work in Heinz's film that reminds me of the one posited by the Great Prophet Hal Lindsay in THE LATE GREAT PLANET EARTH in 1977: that mankind should be forever vigilant that its fiery destruction is just around the corner. Be it at the hands of our loving Lord and Saviour, or vast armies of teeming, towering metallic Venusian killbots, both of which can pulverize us into steak seasoning with just one blast from their laser-precision eye-blasters, it WILL happen. Are YOU ready for it?. And, not coincidentally I'm sure, both films share a distinct set of production values. Coincidence? I think not. Verily, great minds direct alike!

In closing, I'd heartily recommend ORSON HEINZ'S BATTLES OF THE PLANETS for the entire family, and even for those not so fortunately blessed, including heathen single mothers and promiscuous single people. Unlike today's cartoons with their ""hip"" humour, their doe-eyed panty-flashing Japanese wiccan-harlots, and their cynical disregard for conservative family values, there's absolutely nothing in H.G. HEINZ'S WORLDS AT THE WAR that wouldn't find solace within the deveoping mind of a five-year-old.

So get thee to your local Wal-Mart, pronto! I've no doubt supplies of this newly-priced-reduced masterpiece are limited, if the praise afforded it here on Amazon is any indication. Why, I was so impressed with the packaging ALONE that I humbly returned a fresh box of Remington .22 Thunderbolts AND a copy of Mel Gibson's Passion of Mr. Jesus Sticker Book to their respective shelves so I could purchase another copy for my in-laws, who are coming over to the trailer this weekend.

Take it from me, a 20-years-married mother of three, they just don't make them like this anymore!

Take Care and May Ramtha Go With You,

Wells' original novel as well as the 1953 film, the first season of the 1980s TV series, and the 2005 film with Tom Cruise. The DVD cover said that this was a faithful adaptation to H.G. Wells' original classic novel so I decided to give it a chance. It was actually pretty good. My main complaint about the film was the length (running a full three hours). I think it would have been better if shortened 30 minutes. I also didn't like the special effects. You can tell this was made on a tiny budget. But it has a great script for the most part, extremely accurate to the original novel, which did please me, and overall it's really enjoyable.

This particular version is very true to the book (as are the musical versions) and director Timothy Hines did a pretty good job although some of the more regular special effects could have been better.

2311517,1,B0009PW4D2,"If Ed Wood had made a version of War of the Worlds, this would be it -- a film so truly bad that it is actually funny. Nothing about this film shows any professional ability, not the special effects (especially the special effects), the acting, the directing, or the editing (if that is what you can call it). I was  looking forward to a film that goes back to the original story and era. What an utter disappointment. Honestly, I wish I could say something good about this movie but I can't. It comes across as one of those drive-in movies of the early 60s. (Can it be that this is what the filmmakers intended?) Half the scenes show the hero running around a forrest or down a road for no apparent purpose. British soldiers are costumed it what appear to be surplus Italian uniforms. Scenes are inserted with no attention to the logic of the story or continuity. Example: In one scene three people are fleeing the Martians and in the very next they are sitting down eating dinner. The hero smiles, puts a bit of food on the end of his fork, puts the food into a glass, knocks the glass over, and then smiles at his girlfriend. (I'm not making this up.) At this point I guess everyone had given up even trying to make this film work and the project had become an inside joke. Wait to see it on Mystery Science Theater 3000.

2311550,4,B0009PW4D2,"This film has its critics and its fans; I am one of its fans.  This movie, made by some unknown company calling itself  Pendragon
pictures, produced this rather low budget effort with sloppy special effects, silly acting and rather shoddy CGI.  In one scene they
showed a train (obviously an American one) passing by, pulled by an American diesel electric locomotive which didn't exist in 1898
and the passenger cars were not British (I worked for a railroad once).  Later they would show another American train, this time with
a steam engine (better!).The picture often jumped, sometimes skip a frame or two, blurry and lousy  color.  So why did I give it 4 stars?
First, because it is the only version of the book that is faithful to the book.  Only a few changes made, very insignificant  while the rest
very closely followed the book, using much the same dialogue.  The martian designs were ok, but I thought the best part of the film
was the beautifully designed martian fighting machines.  Slick, scary and beautiful!!  The  heat ray was ok, not the flaming laser type found in other invasion movies.  The burning of the houses was for the most part done well, though the fire flames looked
fakey.  The best scene of the film (and it is worth seeing) is when our hero and the curate were trapped in the house crushed by the
fallen cylinder.  Here the special effects were very good and the handling machines the martians  really looked good.  I think most
of the studios budget must have gone into the house scenes.  While this would had made a great picture with a larger budget, I
still rank it above Spielbergs  mess.  Only the 1950s Paramount film tops this in my opinion.  If you like H. G. Wells  book you
should watch.  Be warned, it is 3 hours long and some scenes seem to drag unnecessarily but it is still very watchable.",1385424000,,1837,4.584615384615384

I looked at a fair number of these, and they were pretty much on the mark: a) yes, it is closest to Wells' novel; but, b) it is excruciatingly long and repetitious; c) has terrible acting; and d) has atrocious editing of scenes. The heat ray and striding machines are interesting ... but very crude by today's standards ... or maybe even so when the movie was made. The directors made a special effort to have everyone speak with some sort of a British accent. This was reasonably convincing. (Since the movie was made in the US, where did they get all these actors.)
The Martians with their spindly tentacles could never support themselves in earth's 3x greater gravity. Also, why the huge eyes? Are they nocturnal? But these quirks may be traceable back to Wells himself. The music score was pretty good ... and seems to be strongly influenced by the first part of the Russian folk song ""Polyushka."" (Coincidence?)

While I appreciate any effort toward staying true to any novel as the producers tried to do here, I also appreciate sensible narrative to advance the story - something this film sorely lacks. This release could have also been helped if a sense of spatial proportion or relative proximity to any physical location was established or maintained no less, because it seemed to have a camera stuck in every actors face while they stood around like mannequins. Not to mention that walking distances between locations seemed to be within a few yards or so.

The special effects are atrocious, sort of what you'd expect from a high school film project using 1960's technology. I recall thinking that if the dedication to this version of the story was mixed with the budget spent on the Spielberg/Cruise collaboration THEN we might have a film worth watching.

I picked this DVD at my local library, thinking I'd get a faithful period rendition of the H.G. Wells novel, and I wasn't disappointed.  I didn't expect to have Freddy Mercury for a hero, but I have no doubt it was him barely resurrected, especially 15+ minutes of this (surprisingly hirsute) guy shirtless in a meadow with the handsome blonde, slightly effete and largely neurotic clergyman.

I don't know what there is for anyone to like here. This is one of the worst films I've ever tried to watch. I put up with an hour before giving in (also at the point I discovered it's three hours long). Maybe it gets better, but I couldn't take anymore. I wish I could give it negative five stars. Bad acting, bad effects, no continuity, and the most overuse of colored filters ever. If you want to see a scene in orange filter, followed by blue filter, followed by red filter, followed by green filter, this is your movie.

A large meteor (a brown CGI egg thing, with shading but no shadows) crashes near an English village in the late 1800's. it opens up, and giant head on tentacles comes out, looks around, goes back in and comes back with a ""heat ray"" that makes people do a little dance while painted over with CGI flames, and then turn into identical CGI skeletons. Later, two tripod-like CGI monsters start walking around. Well, when they're not floating like they're permanently-posed action figures.

Backgrounds are obvious greenscreen, suitable for 1970s PBS kids shows. The movie is so cheaply done, they couldn't even afford horses for the buckboard that three characters use at one point; in long shots you see the suggestion of CGI horses, but they don't look like they're moving. Later, the same buckboard is blown up; instead of flipping and crashing, it jumps like a board game pawn. Chimneys are blown off a house, to fall at peoples' feet, all CGI rubble, which they stand in front of until it's all fallen, without trying to run or avoid getting hit. It's completely unrealistic. In the trailer, Big Ben is zapped, and the top half then floats over by itself to smack into a bridge. One actor plays two parts, wearing what looks like the same outfit, except one has the most horrible fake mustache I've ever seen in a supposedly serious film. I didn't even know it was two different people until I looked it up on Wikipedia.

While the cheap budget can be a drawback at times, I also had to give the director a lot of credit for making some very daring artistic choices visually. The FX are not meant to suggest anything realistic looking. If the viewer assumes that, the film fails miserably. Instead, director Hines was trying to convey a feeling closer to the book illustrations of the time WAR OF THE WORLDS was written. He was also probably influenced by Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman and early fantasy film pioneer Georges Melies. If the work of those creators isn't your cup of tea, this film won't be, either. My wife and I were thoroughly charmed by the approach.

The film should be viewed in two sittings, or at least with a leisurely intermission. It is long, but it is the book much more than any other film version I've seen. I am also a big fan of the George Pal and Steven Spielberg films as well.

2311691,5,B0009PW4D2,"Sometimes artists and scientists are ahead of their times. Leonardo invented the helicopter and a new kind of realism in painting, hundreds of years before we were ready for them; some consider Shakespeare to be the first ""psychological realist"" in drama, 300 years before Freud. These two of course have been revered through the ages, but sometimes the great innovators are forgotten and only resurrected through chance or the perseverance of a few devoted followers.

Such a one was Timur Hinesikoff (ca 1892-1937?) the director of the great, forgotten (until now) early sound, color and animation masterpiece The War of the Worlds, filmed in the lost community of Nonsensk, located approximately 800 km northwest of Moscow on the shores of the river Doofka, in the summers of 1929 and 1930.

Hinesikoff was apparently an ethnic Latvian, born in South Africa to Marxist radical activists attempting to start a racial revolt in the early 1890s. He seems to have spent his first 6 or 7 years there before being moved to Russia as a refugee after his parents were killed in the Boer war. It is theorized that the shocks he may have experienced during that conflict, the impact of seeing his parents taken away (and possibly, seeing his father shot) before his eyes, may have formed the genesis of his preoccupations with the English socialist writer H.G. Wells and his visions of future-warfare as an adult.

Taken to live in Moscow by his Russian aunt, Hinesikoff learned Russian as a second language and always maintained a proficiency in English, later learning German and French as well. His extended family were members of the intelligentsia, and his uncle Volgon was an inventor and inveterate tinkerer, probably a genius himself who certainly helped spur young Timur on in his experiments with film, sound, and color. Timur encountered such luminaries as Eisenstein, Pudovkin and Kalatozov through whom he learned the rudiments of the film language, but it would be his own inventions of the so-called ""Hinesikoff Process"" and ""Timurkolor"" that would make his name in film history.

Without getting too technical, the Hinesikoff Process was an early multiplane camera system that predated Walt Disney's experiments by nearly a decade; even more novel was the inventor/filmmaker's idea to combine both animation and live action, and to film the whole in color. His Timurkolor was extremely variable in quality due to its need for optimal light conditions - the results typically show bright, almost 3-color Technicolor-type hues in bright natural light but a more artificial 2-color or sepia character in lower light conditions. He also had invented a new film type that would allow a much more seamless blend of the animated effects and the live-action footage - or so it would seem. Alas this last element was never quite perfected and thus the effects sequences in War of the Worlds at times look primitive even by 1930 standards, despite the color and the vastly superior sound.

It should be noted that Hinesikoff was working off a vast fortune; despite his own parents' deeply-held Marxist/anti-capitalist beliefs and his attraction to British-style socialism, it either never occured to the filmmaker that he was only able to create his epic through the system he despised, or there was some justification he devised for it. We will likely never know; most of the director's papers seem to have vanished around the time he did, in a Stalinist purge shortly before World War II. And Hinesikoff apparently spent nearly all of his fortune acquiring the worldwide rights to Wells' bestseller and filming it.

Allowances of course must be made with a film of this type, but it may help to know something of the circumstances in which it was made. Given Hinesikoff's insistance on showing the true horrors of war, and the reluctance of Stalin's government to allow him to film in or near any large city - as well as his insistence on making the film in multiple languages to reach the largest possible audience (a not-uncommon practice in the very early days of sound film), the small town of Nonsensk was chosen, and it was the only possible candidate. Nonsensk, in the late 1920s and early 1930s was an artificially created utopian city, little-known outside of the Party in the Soviet Union at the time and not at all known elsewhere; it was in fact a cosmopolitan, multilingual town made up of Marxist and Communist refugees from England, France, and the United States - mostly the latter - and it was funded as a technological experiment. Here Hinesikoff could find his actors, and build his virtual animation studio. Here also he happened to meet his composer, Jamie Hall, whose lush romantic score was reminiscent of Borodin, and his Swedish production designer Eric Nielsen, responsible for so much of the bright, unearthly and very un-English look of the piece - clearly deliberate and meant to throw the viewer off and create a sense of unease.

The actors were, not surprisingly, mostly amateurs with linguistic backgrounds. As Hinesikoff was spending most of his money on his models and animation, and as this was clearly what was most important to him - the film contains an absolutely unprecedented amount of FX work, which would not be equalled in any film made anywhere until the 1990s - great dramatic ability was not always to be found or even looked for. Then, too, we must remember that the exaggerated style evident in such characters as the Writer (Anthony Piana) was more common in those immediate post-silent days - and The War of the Worlds was, in fact, the very first Soviet sound film released. More problematic to modern audiences still will be the length of the film - 3 hours - but taking a close look at what few records survive of the picture's abortive test screenings indicate that this was problematic for the early audiences as well. Hinesikoff's genius at invention and his forward-looking depiction of future-war did not, apparently, gel even in 1930 with his amateurish cast and his rather too literal screenplay.

Also worth noting are the herky-jerky character of many scenes, particularly ones in which animation is involved; whether this is because they were shot silent and never quite properly synched, or because there are actual frames missing (again, not uncommon with Russian film of the period) remains unknown. In fact, for as many ways as the film points forward, and even might be considered avant-garde, in just as many it remains primitive and tied to the early sound era from which it comes - there is precious little camera movement for example, despite Hinesikoff's smaller, more mobile camera and sophisticated sound equipment.

Still, some were impressed, among them the great writer of the original story himself, who soon afterwards embarked on getting many more of his ideas onto the big screen - the 1930s was a good decade for H.G. Wells indeed. And directors such as Eisenstein, Disney and Powell expressed admiration for the virtuoso effects techniques in the 10 years or so that the film remained in limited circulation; and over the succeeding years it seems that a few major filmmakers of modern times (most notably Guy Maddin and Robbie Moffat) have managed to bask in it's novelty as well. Somehow, though, by 1940 it had vanished out of general circulation, and so it remained for 65 years until the director's great-grandson, the American Timothy Hines, brought it back to life in this stunning DVD.

Some cynics have actually suggested, absent proper documentation either on the disc or in any proper university or film archives, that this whole project is in fact a hoax - that there never was a Hinesikoff, that all of what I have just written was in fact made up by film scholars to discredit Mr. Hines, who unfortunately seems to believe that this is, in fact, his own work. While feeling quite sorry for Mr. Hines in his clearly problematic state, I think it quite obvious that no one, sane or not, could actually have made such a film as this in all seriousness in 2005. As a bold experiment with new technology, far ahead of its time in the between-war years, this is an extraordinary achievement; but as a film made 28 years after Star Wars? No one could make up a joke so bad as that.",1252886400,7,8275,4.916964924838941
2311692,1,B0009PW4D2,"Mere words cannot describe the orgasmic joy that raced through me after watching Timothy Heinz's semenal retelling of Mr. H.G. Well's classic science fiction novel WARS OF THE WORLDS.

I simply must express my deepest, most sincerest gratitude to Mr. Heinz and his fine company for making this viewer's life just a little more worth living with their wonderful motion picture event for the ages. That such unbridled excitement could be had when it was in print for mere dollars, at Wal-Mart, that bastion of American ingenuity, FAIR employment practices (take THAT, Robert Greenwald!) and good old wholesome Christian goodness, further cements Mr. Heinz's reputation, at least in my eyes, as a man of vision, faith and enormous entrepreneurial resolve. I for one cannot wait for the next release from Snapdragon Pictures. That is, now that this critical re-edit has graced our screens.

But on to the film itself. Short form or long, this one's a keeper.

With a eye toward realism and a masterful command of the cinematic language unheard of since the days of Cecily DeMille or W.D. Griffins or Charlie Chapman, Heinz deftly transports us back to a time and place that we can only imagine in our inferior minds - Pennsylvania, 1898, where a cast of thousands in their Civil War-era finery are subjected to a terrifying invasion of gigantic mechadroidal spider monsters that lay waste to much of Pittsburgh, including Big Ben!! Sweet Christ on a feathery cloud this movie is fantastic!

Suffice it to say that Tony Piano is an inspired choice as the Main Character, ably switching from a sort of lethargic trance-like condition (totally in keeping with the scepticism of his character) to super heroics that would make John-Claud Vandam hang up his numb-chucks within a single sequence! Truly an acting legend has been born in this film. Mark my words, we'll be hearing a lot more from Mr. Piano down the road.

And let us not forget the lovely Jamie Lynn Cease as the ravishing Miss Elfinsteen. What I wouldn't give to put a tap on that and sell it to the world, if you know what I mean. Wait a minute, what DO you think I mean. How DARE you, you heathen sinners.

I've read that TIMOTHY WELLES' WARS OF THE WORLDS cost OVER $175,000 TO MAKE! That's a lot of money, and I can assure you, every penny of it is up on the screen, though less so now that he's cut half of it out. The special effects in this film, despite the obviously planted naysayers here on Amazon, are some of the finest work I've seen since TV's Harry Thomason graced us with THE DAY IT CAME TO EARTH way, waaay back in 1979 (why I can remember seeing that one at the Starlight Drive In out on the one-oh-five). Hasn't been a decent special-effects driven film since then, I say. In fact, not since THE PASSIONS OF MR. JESUS or LEFT BEHIND II: TRIBULATION FORCE has a movie left me so emotionally drained yet charged with a renewed enthusiasm to confront this hellish liberal cesspool that plagues these end of times! Praise Timmy Heinz! Praise!

This is truly a film for our troubled times, based on a book for our troubled times, except it was for our troubled times back then, and they were less troubled back then than they are now, let me tell you! There's a potent subtext at work in Heinz's film that reminds me of the one posited by the Great Prophet Hal Lindsay in THE LATE GREAT PLANET EARTH in 1977: that mankind must be forever vigilant that its fiery destruction is just around the corner. Be it at the hands of our loving Lord and Saviour, or vast armies of teeming, towering metallic Venusian killbots, both of which can pulverize us into steak seasoning with just one blast from their laser-precision eye-blasters, it WILL happen. Are YOU ready for it?. And, not coincidentally I'm sure, both films share a distinct set of production values. Coincidence? I think not. Verily, great minds direct alike!

In closing, I'd heartily recommend ORSON HEINZ'S BATTLES OF THE PLANETS for the entire family, and even for those not so fortunately blessed, including heathen unwed mothers and promiscuous single people. Unlike today's cartoons with their ""hip"" humour, their doe-eyed panty-flashing Japanese wiccan-harlots, and their cynical disregard for conservative family values, there's absolutely nothing in H.G. HEINZ'S WORLDS AT THE WAR that wouldn't find solace within the developing mind of a five-year-old.

So get thee to your local Wal-Mart, pronto! I've no doubt supplies of this newly-priced-reduced masterpiece are limited, if the praise afforded it here on Amazon in its original incarnation is any indication. Why, I was so impressed with the packaging ALONE that I humbly returned a fresh box of Remington .22 Thunderbolts AND a copy of Mel Gibson's Passion of Mr. Jesus Sticker Book to their respective shelves so I could purchase another copy for my in-laws, who are coming over to the trailer this weekend.

Take it from me, a 20-years-married mother of three, they just don't make 'em like this anymore!

Take Care and May Ramtha Go With You,

2311693,1,B0009PW4D2,Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen.  You have to make an effort to make something this bad.  Three hours of my life wasted.  I watched it last night and still cannot believe how bad the special efforts were.  They look like a game from a Commodore 64 computer.  The mustache looks plastic and appears like it came out of a Cracker Jack box.  Incredible.,1230422400,2,362,4.409090909090909

2311695,2,B0009PW4D2,"As other reviewers have said, I was looking forward to watching an authentic adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novel.  At the same time, I was aware that this film was made on a modest budget, with the expected results.

Well, this movie was worse than I anticipated.  The special effects looked rather cartoonish, especially compared to the state of the art (Spielberg).  Worse, the use of colored filters in many scenes got to be extremely annoying after awhile.  Even the overall quality of the print was mediocre at best, with oversaturated color and only fair sharpness.  And the acting won't get any Oscar nominations.

Also, I'm wondering if the original 3 hour release would be better to watch storywise.  In this 125 minute version, there is a lot of jumping from one subplot to another without adequate scene development in my opinion.  The Martian ""red weed"" appears briefly in a few scenes without any explanation.

On the plus side, I thought the tripods and handling machines looked pretty cool, the sound effects are pretty good, and the musical score is beautiful.  Unfortunately, that's not enough to overcome the otherwise poorly executed production.  If only the CGI were state of the art, and the color filters eliminated, it would be a good, but not great movie.  If only.....",1229731200,3,1297,4.921658986175115
2311706,1,B0009PW4D2,"I hated the 2005 film with Tom Cruise: it bore so little resemblance to the novel, it shouldn't have been called ""War of the Worlds.""  (Forbidden Planet wasn't called The Tempest, even though it says it was inspired by it.)  I liked the 1953 George Pal film, although it lacked a crucial image that scared me wonderfully at age 10, when I first read the book: the three-legged war machines.  (The George Pal version is embarrassing to watch today too: the leading lady's main job is evidently to scream at the Martians.)  The Orson Welles radio version is my favorite telling of the story, even better than the novel: it's no wonder many people thought it was a real news report.

I therefore welcomed the idea of this film, as a faithful adaptation set in the 1890s.  I enjoyed the scenes of this in Carl Sagan's TV series Cosmos: I long thought it was too bad there wasn't a full-length feature film like this that told the whole story.  I don't mind cheap special effects, if a film is fun to watch: indeed, sometimes bad special effects can make a film more fun to watch, as in some old Doctor Who episodes or Godzilla movies.  IMO, the only real sin a film can commit is to be boring.

This film was excruciatingly boring.  A competent film editor could have reduced it to half its thee-hour length, and should have.  Again, I didn't so much mind the over-use of green-screen techniques (for example, for nearly all the scenes riding in carriages): when Oberon waves his hand and says ""I am invisible"" in A Midsummer Night's Dream, I can see that he's invisible.  This film was 90-95% faithful to the original (the author's making his way into a deserted London at the end is cut), but that might not have been advisable: the whole sub-plot of the writer's brother and the two ladies he befriends could have been cut, as it was little more than a distraction, even in the book.

What was inexcusable was how much time I had to spend twiddling my thumbs, waiting for the next scene, in practically every scene of the film.  They could easily have cut many of the less-effective special effects, for example the last shot of the first meteor seen in flight, the only one in which one can see it in detail.  And why, oh why, do we have to see a human squashed underfoot by a Martian war machine TWICE?!?

It portended badly literally from the very beginning, with the opening narration: ""No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that our world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own...Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this Earth with envious eyes and slowly, and surely, drew their plans against us.""  I still get a chill whenever I listen to Orson Welles read that, even though I've listened to my CD of the radio show hundreds of times; the actor who read it on Cosmos delivered it well, too.  When the guy who read that in this film read it, it was flat and lifeless: Bill Gates could have delivered these lines more effectively.

Furthermore, if the audience must be subjected to having to stare at actors for long periods of time, the actors really ought to convey emotion convincingly, or in other words, act.  Part of the fault here was the direction: but then, this was so bad, I couldn't discern much of the dialog, even though I knew what they were about to say because I re-read the novel recently.  The costumes were OK, except for the leading man's clearly fake mustache: Monty Python did fake mustaches better than that.

That's three hours of my life I'll never get back.  This is one of the few DVDs I have actually thrown in the garbage: I don't want to risk subjecting anyone else to this.",1214784000,4,3828,4.507959479015919

I would give you specifics but the fact is I would have to recount the entire movie.  The acting is terrible, the cinematography would not pass a college course, and the interpretation of the original material is by far the worst.

It took WEEKS for me to get through the whole film.  I literally had to stop over and over because I just couldn't take it!  When I eventually did finish I put the CD away and swore I would never inflict such pain on myself again.  If I could give this no stars, I would.",1203206400,3,749,4.181818181818182
2311709,1,B0009PW4D2,"You're probably an H.G. Wells fan.

You're probably appreciative of independent, low-budget cinema, and unfazed by poor special effects.  You can see past the gloss, and artistry brings more value to a film than millions of dollars of slick production value.

On the flip side, you might even fetch some amusement from occasional bad movies.

Having read the bipolar reviews for this film, you're probably thinking that you can't lose.  If it's good, everyone wins.  If it's bad, at least it should be fun to watch.  But read the reviews carefully.  You might think you can take this movie on, but it's out of your league.  This movie has left a trail of dead optimistic movie buffs in its wake.  Like the rest, it will crush you and dance on your grave.

I was one of those left-for-dead optimistic movie buffs.  I love movies, with my tastes ranging from Harmony Korine to Ed Wood.  I regarded this faithful version of ""War of the Worlds"" as a worthy gamble, capable of a great payoff, and invited over two other optimistic movie buffs to share the risk.  We even had a few drinks, to soften our expectations.

This is one of those bad movies that makes you feel miserable, that makes you feel like a sucker, that makes you regret not stopping it sooner.  This movie basically torments your soul for its entire three-hour runtime.  When we watched it that night, it held up for thirty minutes, max.  At one hour, I was embarrassed.  At two, I was wishing I was dead.  During the final scenes, three-plus hours into the movie's runtime, I was wishing I had never been born.

To paraphrase ""The Simpsons"":  I no longer fear Hell, because I have seen this movie.

Why?  The causes are far too multifarious to sum up with a simple diagnosis, but I'll give it a try.  The pacing was painful.  The acting was excruciating, even egregious.  While Anthony Piana and a few other actors earned their (small) paycheck, the rest of the cast was straight out of a junior-high-school talent show.  The special effects were worse than distracting, in that frequently you couldn't actually tell what was supposed to be happening.  (And if this was supposed to be 'artistic style', it didn't work at all, and the director should have recognized that.)

This was a movie that clearly didn't have any feedback during its production, was created by a director who lacked an eye for competent cinema, and was probably just an avaricious ploy to scam money by pushing a substandard product into the marketplace concurrently with Spielberg's version and riding its wave of publicity.

Still, some people claim to love this movie, and given how radical opinions can swing, I'm certain that some people do.  Yet there's apparently something else at work, resulting in an alternative reason for the bipolar nature of these reviews, and there's much controversy regarding their veracity.  Not just on Amazon, but in other sources as well.  To whit:

-- The film company (Pendragon) insists that they are the subject of a guerilla smear campaign by Paramount, which is using a nameless PR firm to debase the value of this film, since it is viewed as a competitor to Spielberg's version.  (I.e., an army of faceless paid drones are posting negative reviews to make the movie look bad.)

-- Many film enthusiasts believe that numerous false positive reviews have been issued by Pendragon, with the intention of misrepresenting the public opinion regarding their movie, and thus inflating their sales.  (I.e., the filmmaker and his buddies are posting positive reviews to make the movie look good.)

With such identical accusations being flung from opposing sides of the fence, it implies that one of the parties is likely to be correct:  that several of the reviews are fabricated, of either the highly-positive or highly-negative variety.

My one-star review probably indicates where I stand, and I'm so annoyed by Pendragon's apparent act of deception that it fueled me to write this review.  But don't let me alone convince you:

-- Browse the other reviews here on amazon.com.  Be sure to get a representative sample.  (And to get a feeling for their sincerity, browse the reviews for other products written by those reviewers.)

-- Read the discussions/forum about this movie on amazon.com.

-- Read the reviews on IMDB.  (As I write this, it has a rating of 2.5 out of 10, from 798 users.)

-- Check out the Wikipedia entry for this movie.

-- Look at the trailers on youtube.com, as well as the blackmoon spoofs.

You might think, Why do all this research for just a movie?  But this is a *three hour* movie, which hundreds of people claim will not only be a waste of your time, but will spur an emotional response akin to watching a loved one being horribly humiliated on national television.  You owe yourself twenty minutes of confirmation before taking the plunge.  There are lots of data out there, and it will certainly sway you one way or the other.  I wish I had done it myself before pushing ""PLAY"".

Personally, I recommend that you quell your curiosity and stay away.  I don't regard this as a movie, but a con-job disguised as art.  (And honestly, the premise of this film is so promising, I would've been interested in viewing one of the shorter, revised ""director's cuts"" that have since been released, to give the film another chance.  But because of the apparent deception by Pendragon, I'm not going to fall for that again.)

Still, if you decide to venture forth and give this movie a day in court, I'd encourage you to rent it, and of the three versions of this film that exist, you should watch the original, full-length (three-hour) version, so you can see what all the fuss is about.",1199491200,9,5684,4.757420675537359

2311713,2,B0009PW4D2,"I had been eager to see this film version of H.G. Wells classic novel as the producers claimed it would remain faithful to the original location & period of late Victorian Great Britain.

Initially I had been put off from purchasing this film since the original release in 2005 due to the initial, and significant quantity of, complaints of low production values, poor FX , below par acting and ""endless walking scenes"". Suffice to say that my passion for the novel and courisity had got the better of me and I had to see this film for myself.

Basically I was aware of the short comings and did not have high expectations of the production therefore I can say in all honesty that I did enjoy the film despite the faults which are too numerous to list here and have been covered already by reviewers far more eloquent than me.

The editing of scenes & events would confuse a viewer who has not read the original novel and they would soon lose the plot as the film switches between scenes of the narrator in Woking and his brother in London. at one particular moment the brother is supposedly in a London street then suddenly witnesses the attack on the Elfinstone ladies in a country lane and runs to their rescue.

Martian red weed appears just after the attack on both Woking and Shepperton with no explanation within the film at any time as to what it actually is.

Much has been said of the encounter between HMS Thunderchild and the martians as the brother escapes England on a ""paddlesteamer"" , suffice to say it is truly awful and would have been better to be left out altogether. There is one much heralded scene where a tripods legs stride towards and over an artillery battery which is probably the best effect within this film and shows what could have been.

Acting? There is some truly awful dialogue between the characters. I defy anyone for instance not to end up cringing when watching the stilted exchange between the Elfinstone ladies and the brother as they ""discuss"" how they are to escape from England. I would also award the James Doohan award for the worst Scottish accent witnessed on film since Brigadoon when the narrator converses with a soldier on Horsell Common. In contrast when you watch the interaction with the actors trapped in the ruined house, also the encounter by the narrator of the dead woman in a ""London"" street, you are sadly reminded again of what could have been.

I have given this film 2 stars which is generous and for the following reasons.

The music score is fantastic.

It is refreshing that the film is faithful to events in the book and had made the effort , albeit poorly, to set the book in Victorian England and not yet another updated version set in the US. Regretably due to cost constraints British style buildings are digitised and set Monty Python style within a field in Washington State to represent Woking, Shepperton or London.

I did like the design of the fighting machines, also the handlers in the pit scenes.

Above all else my 17 year old daughter who watched this film was not impressed at all but was intrigued as to the films setting and location. As a result she has made the effort to read the novel and to my surprise read it from cover to cover. The irony is that H.G Wells has gained another young admirer despite the very poor quality of this film and for this I am truly grateful.

Would I however recommend this movie to a friend?

Sadly not if I wanted them to stay friends.",1174608000,13,3458,4.540192926045016

[NEW VERSION] As to the editing it is true that the newer one has been improved. The tighter editing made the film's pace faster than the first one. Instead of deleting one entire episode, the newer one shortened or removed one or more shots of each scene. You notice some part of dialogues or shots (of characters walking in the country road, for instance) are missing in the revised edition. This is certainly is improvement as a whole, but the film's tempo would have been much better had they removed certain episodes entirely, such as the one in which an old man is locked in the barn.

However, I didn't notice much difference in the special effects, which was not the best I had seen. I'm sorry if I am wrong, but I watched the earlier version for comparison again and my impression is, frankly, what's the difference? That does not mean they didn't retouch the film. In the original version, film's continuity was not clear in the scenes where we witness the alien's massive attack from the landed cylinder, but the re-edited one makes it clear by inserted footage of moving clouds and added dark tint. The naval action sequence gets much shorter with less shots of the CGI-created boats. All shots of paddle wheeler which were out of place in the original are wisely removed.

But can I call this new film improvement? It is and it is not. It's hard to say. I like the film though I know it is not good. I like the idea of setting the film's time in late Victorian era, but the town didn't look Victorian enough. I like the designs of the tripods better than Spielberg's, but their movements look ... you know ... too light. To really improve these things, the amateurish acting and all means staring from scratch, but that would mean making another film after all.",1173484800,8,2657,4.51875
2311736,5,B0009PW4D2,"What is left to say about this remarkable film ? Make no mistake, Director Tim Hines is a very special talent. I should imagine Spielberg himself has probably praised this film to his friends in private. I should also think that the Master H.G Wells would have been very happy with this accurate portrayal of his classic novel. The FX department at Pendragon deserve a mention for the terrifying martians. The martian machines ''rolling motion'' that Wells describes is accurately reproduced throughout the film. I was shocked to the root of my soul when the martians first appeared from the cylinder. But I knew without even seeing the invaders that that they were going to be shocking by the expressions on the faces of the talented cast, they looked utterly disgusted when standing on the edge of the pit. Throughout the film the tension continues at a very steady pace which was enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. The wonderful finale where our hero, Anthony Piana, seems almost crazed with joy at the strange death of the martians must surely reflect the relief at the massive effort that he put into his triumphant role. I watched the movie with my grandfather who sadly past away a few days after. It's comforting to know that the last film he saw was this.",1167868800,4,1271,4.653333333333333
2311737,5,B0009PW4D2,"Wow.  I saw the original 3 hour version last year, and with effort watched the entire thing in one sitting (while drinking a bottle of wine!).  Although it was somewhat of a disappointment, especially given the hype around the film, I too generally liked it's quirky and antique style.  There were truly some moments of brilliance, but these were ultimately lost in the odd editing and the scenes that dragged and dragged.

I actually was surprised that a re-cut did not come sooner, because even at that time I thought this movie would be really good with some re-tooling.  Well, I've watched this new version, and it is a vast improvement!  Sure, if you hated the original movie with a passion, no re-cut or re-tooling will ever change your opinion.  But this film, at an hour shorter than the original cut - actually has more scenes (such as completing out the artilleryman's story)!  I'm not sure how they added scenes but took off time, but they did!  For the most part, everything is still there, it just plays better, is totally re-edited, and is now the complete story.

And the special effects are improved as well, but the basic animated style of it remains.  They definitely tackled the fixes that really needed improvement - such as giving the heat ray victims a melting flesh sort of look and some other cool things like that.

So overall it's the same movie - but is shortened, added to, improved upon, and much much more watchable.  Oh, and I'm keeping my original copy, BTW - cuz that's just a weird bubble in the history of War of the Worlds renditions, but I'm probably not going to watch it again.

I cannot imagine that shortening the original will do it many favours, as I suspect this will simply lose what quirky charm it has without improving it.  The special effects certainly could do with upgrading, but unless they have been redone from scratch it's unlikely that they'll have changed much.

However, unlike all the previous reviewers, I didn't find the original unwatchable.  It's done in the style of a silent film, and though this was probably only done because they had no money and the actors were mediocre, it doesn't entirely fail.  Even the dodgy stop motion Martians and the daft 'dancing skeletons' might have impressed an audience in 1919.  The original 3 hour film is a closer adaptation of the book than most film versions (at least it's set c. 1900 and not in 1953 or 2005), and in places it does give a decent impression of the collapse of a civilisation.  I admit the special effects are pitiful in places, and little effort has been made to hide the fact that it was all filmed in the Pacific Northwest  (even the military uniforms are more American than British, while the paddle steamer carrying refugees that 'Thunderchild' saves is a tiny sternwheeler intended for tours on a Washington State lake rather than a proper ship - and someone can't pronounce ""Harwich""), but the film was clearly made by someone who cared about the book, and that redeems it to a significant extent.

I still didn't get it until after the opening and suddenly I was hearing words from the original story by H.G. Wells. I'm giving the movie 3 stars because it appears true to the book; however, be warned: the acting was sad in parts, special effects were dated, and there were some continuity issues.

I'm a former teacher and think I would have found a way to incorporate this adaptation with the reading of the book for comparisons/contrasts. It's also great for history. And it would be an excellent discussion point, talking about how the humans were reduced to acting like animals due to fear and starvation.

So, from an educational standpoint with ties to literature and history, I say okay; from an entertainment standpoint I find myself curious about the budget - surely it wasn't widely distributed?

I went into it with an open mind...I really did. This version of the story starts off promising, I found the cinematography to be really interesting in it's use of sepia and tinted backgrounds and it was obvious that Timothy Hines, the director was trying to make it look as if the film was made around the turn of the century. It was true to the story too and this pleased me. The specials effects, crude by today's standards actually had a charm all their own... at the start. The first turkey indicator was the mustache on the main charactor, it looked like it was purchased from a Wal-Mart costume display at Halloween time and I found myself laughing out loud every time I concentrated on it. It started to become a distraction. The acting for the most part was really awful, particularly the main charactor's wife. I was resolved however to see this thing through it's entire lenght. Another distraction was the editing which was as inept as it gets. If a charactor has to get from one place to another we are treated to endless takes of them walking through fields and woods forever and ever. No wonder this thing runs 3 hours, but I was anxious to see the infamous tripods so I kept telling myself to hang in there. When they finally appeared they got the biggest laugh of all out of me as they hoped and skipped in jerky strides across the landscape. At this point I said to myself ""So many good movies and so little time, I'm outta' here."" I went downstairs to my DVD library and pulled out Spielberg's version and for 2 hours I watched the work of a master and enjoyed that film more then I ever have.",1154131200,16,1771,4.435582822085889

Thanks, everybody! Due in large part to your reviews I have decided to heed your warnings and skip past this ""turkey""! Because of your ""common consensus,"" as it were, ""curiousity"" will by no means kill THIS particular ""cat""!

Yes, I felt the very powerful urge to experience this version of ""WotW,"" especially after (1)- hearing repeatedly how amazingly ""faithful"" this version was to Mr. Wells' original vision and (2)- having been SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED (to 'gag-reflex' levels) by Steven Spielberg's drippy-syrupy, happy-sappy, and completely illogical abomination of the same source material (replete with the otherwise lovely & talented Dakota Fanning's irritating ""Screaming Mimi"" performance).

So despite all of the ""warnings"" about the ""bad acting,"" the ""bad editing,"" the ""bad cinematography,"" and the ""bad special effects,"" I still played around with the idea that its faithfulness to the original story would more than make up for all of this film's many production faults -- or that I could at least overlook such faults, as I often am capable of doing when presented with an entriguing-enough story to involve myself in (""Sleepaway Camp,"" anyone?). But the more I read of your reviews, the more doubts I began to have, until it led me to do the ONE thing I had yet to do -- VIEW THE TRAILERS! Therefore allow me, please, to repeat EVERYTHING which has repeatedly been expressed throughout these reviews based solely on my observation of the three ""theatrical"" trailers I viewed of this movie:

* less-than-impressive cinematography
* stale/wooden (read: ""awful"") acting
* uninspiring & amateurish special effects
* incompetent editing

That this is the closest ""by the book"" film adaptation we have of the original story seems, to me, to be this film's only major (if not exclusive) selling point.

I have this uncanny ability to ""look beyond"" poorly produced/directed/acted films in favor of a ""good story"" (or, at least, a ""decent"" one), but I simply CANNOT bear to sit through such a high concentration  of these cinematic deficits all pressed neatly together into one complete package! If only a series of motion picture promotional ""trailers"" can cause me to utterly reject ANY AND EVERY interest in a film project I may have initially had & held onto quite so effectively, then I can only consider myself SPARED of even greater disappointment from something that was surely to be a much more horrendous experience 3-hours in length! From all that I have observed and read, I do not even believe (as many of you seem to do) that a ""larger budget"" would have made one bean of difference!

Thank you, my friends, from the very bottom of my heart! Thank you for your help in saving me from a fate not exactly ""worse-than-death"" but pretty damn close!

A movie devoid of proper computer effects rendering and film editing.

There you have the background to the making of this picture.

Am i being too harsh? well suffice to say that about 20 mins into this film I was starting to wish for real aliens to come down and zap me out of my misery! The speech pauses between lines were intolerable, the acting was unconvincing from pretty much everybody and they all seem to keep repeating what each other say 4 or 5 times in case we didn't catch everything the first three times! Maybe the film could have been 90 mins instead of 180 if we weren't so deaf and stupid!!

The first time I saw the aliens i thought i was watching an episode of 'The Flumps' on children's tv. The fact that people pretended to look terrified at these cuties with tenticles left me in utter hysterics. It's interesting how a human can be burnt down to their bones and still find time to roll around on the floor screaming and waving arms when they have no voice box, muscles, ligaments or any kind of general organs left!!??

To sum up - 1. If you want to know the story read the book. 2. If you want great visual effects and a far higher standard of acting see spielberg's offering (but it has a weak story!) 3. If you want a compromise between the above 2 then watch the 1953 edition.

Apologies to the reviewers who gave this 5 stars but... come on guys...This is PANTS! In fact it's worse than pants!!

2311763,5,B0009PW4D2,"[...]In many instances, this seems to arise from a lack of understanding of what the director is up to here.  Let's be clear about this: you cannot buy a better version of War of the Worlds.

Let's start, however, with the (very minor) defects in the film.  The cast is obviously enthusiastic but inexperienced.  Most of them are in their first or second films.  Their inexperience isn't helped by the fact that they're in part imitating acting conventions of the period - the last year of the 19th Century, 1900 CE.  The film is probably a little overlong - a minute under 3 hours.  However, this stems (as we will see) from a desire to do a faithful production of Wells' original story.  Computer effects (especially of buildings on fire or being blown up) are admittedly cheesy but serviceable.

Unlike any other version, this War of the Worlds actually is ""War of the Worlds"".  Other versions are merely pale reflections, no matter how impressive the acting or special effects.  This version hews closely to Wells' actual narrative.  Unlike some other place that looks more impressive when it's blown up, the setting is Wells': in and near rural Woking, England (with some scenes in and near suburban London).  The Martians themselves, and their machines, are shown as Wells described them.  The Martians' vampirism is also realistically shown - although their meal is not followed by what Wells described as ""a prolonged and cheerful hooting"".  The cleverest device of the directory was to create a widescreen color film that even so had the look of having been filmed in 1900.

Early film-makers were unable to rely on standard stock of celluloid, but instead used whatever film they could get.  The result was often work of uneven color quality - different shades of black, sepia, blue, and red most commonly.  Some films were even made ""color"" by hand tinting.  This film shows all those characteristics.  Some scenes appear as if shot through a blue, red, or sepia filter.  In others, the natural color is washed out to a brownish shade.  Some, shot in primarily forest or grass settings, show a shade of green typical of hand tinting.  Many viewers, clueless as to the history of film, may view these telling effects as ""defects"".

Overall this version of ""War of the Worlds"" is brilliant, although the originality of its conception is hampered by an obviously limited budget.  Its length, which may seem a burden, effectively reflects Wells' leisurely approach in building to dramatic climaxes.  The result is more interesting and dramatically sound than the modern practice of constant shocks to the system.

Of all versions of Wells' SF masterpiece, this is the one to own - even if you've already got Tom Cruise's (admittedly pretty good) slam-bang-slam-bang-slam-bang-can-Dakota-Fanning-scream-any-louder version.",1144972800,9,2828,5.038793103448276
2311764,1,B0009PW4D2,"After more then a century, here at last is the first period set version of the classic novel The War Of The Worlds. Now you would think that a s hour long version of the classic novel would be a good thing. But what this film is instead is one of the most badly acted, poorly done, and overly faithful films ever made.

Now the film has two things going for it. The first being that it is a straight adaptation of the novel. This is a plus for fans of the original novel who've been waiting forever for an actual adaptation of the novel. The script is incredibly faithful to the novel though it uses some things too much and uses some things (like the Writer in the ruins of London) too little. The other plus is the film's music. Jamie Hall produced a terrific score to the film. The music perfectly fits the scenes it is used in and whenever in appears it boosts the film considerably.

But these are only a small part of the film. And they can't save it from its greatest faults. Between the horrible acting, terrible CGI effects, and a massive length, this film is a complete and utter disaster. Allow me to explain further:

The acting in the film is terrible to say the least. The performances are uninspired and while the actors suit their roles physically, they never do seem to be able to get into their characters. The acting in the scene when the Martains first use the heat ray is laughable not only because of the bad special effects but because of the bad acting. The fact that all of the characters are British with obvious American accents is further proof of the low budget nature of the film.

The special effects are CGI and bad CGI at that. The scene in which The Writer and his Wife are looking up into the night sky is the first of many examples I can think of. The use of CGI to create cities is laughable and incredibly obvious. The constant use of the same extras in scenes showing chaos in cities is another piece of proof of the low budget. And let's not forget the Martains! Instead of being as terrifying as the people in the film made it seem, it is a bad piece of CGI and laughable to say the least.

The film's length is another issue. A lot of the film is spent walking. There is a constant amount of walking in the film is astronomical and slows the film down to lee then a snail's pace. A ton of the film could have been cut out to make it shorter and maybe even better.

Overall this is a disaster. I reccomend this only if you're a die-hard Welles fan in search of a straight adaptation of the novel then this is the film for you. Or maybe if you are a fan of the really, really bad 1950's sci-fi films. Otherwise avoid this film and the three hours of your life you will lose to it.",1144800000,,2720,4.221153846153846
2311765,1,B0009PW4D2,"If this movie was meant to be a comedy, I would give it 5 stars. However, as far as I can tell, this movie was not supposed to be funny. I found myself laughing hysterically throughout the entire thing. I don't even know where to begin. The movie is roughly 3 hours in length and half of it is just this guy walking. One moment he'll be in a city walking around and in the very next scene he'll be in the woods walking around. Then it will turn to night and he'll be walking around. Then all of a sudden it's daytime and guess what.....he's walking around again. The movie doesn't ever seem to have a particular time of day that events are taking place in. One scene has a man and woman looking up into the night sky at the stars. As the camera turns to show their faces it can be clearly seen that there is broad daylight behind them. The camera then turns again to the night sky in front of them. Insanely obvious mistakes like this are all over this movie.

In many scenes the actors appear to be just as confused as the audience about what's going on, so they just make a random face. The special effects make the 50's version look futuristic. Humans that get zapped by the aliens turn into skeletons and somehow still manage to throw their arms about with no muscles. Horses and people off in the distance look like South Park characters waddling back and forth as they move. The list goes on...

Apart from the fact that the film does follow very closely the book, there is absolutely nothing else good to say about Timothy Hines' work. The film is three hours of pure trash. I actually only watched the film to the half way point before I switched the film off. The visual effects look like they were done 50 years ago. The 1953 film by George Pal out performed Timothy Hines version in respect of the visual effects. Acting was terrible too. Just the feel of the film as a whole was just completely wrong. I can't help wondering what Timothy Hines was thinking as he made this film. Movies made for television are better in quality than this film. So after all this time waiting for somebody to make a movie verion of H.G. Wells' War Of The Worlds I'm still waiting. By today's standards, the opportunity is there for a spectacular movie version and it's a shame the Spielberg version, as much as I love the film, decided to take the modern route instead of being faithhful to H.G.

The dialogue is perfect old English and poetic. The story follows the journey of the narrator in the original book to a T.

It doesn't have the budget of the big Spielberg version, nor does it have ILM doing the special effects, but the effects are inspired and the acting is pleasurable. The love interest between the main characters shines. The invaders are scary. At the low price it is, you can't go wrong in giving it a try.",1138060800,4,610,4.213675213675214
2311812,1,B0009PW4D2,"Simply put, this film is an abomination to the film industry and editing in particular.  Interminably long and SLOW, nobody in my family could watch it in its entirety.  I could only watch the first 40 minutes or so of this 3-hour tour, at which point the Martians had just recently made their first appearance.  I grant the beginning is less action packed, but even the ""action sequences"" I saw were so poorly edited, any sense of drama or tension was sucked right out of them.  I know some may criticize this review since I did not see the whole movie, but it doesn't really matter how great the end of a movie is if you can't make it through the beginning or middle.  My father did make it through the movie by fast-forwarding sections, and I did catch many later sections, none of which improved my overall impression of the film.

The special effects are not horrible, but nothing to write home about.  Several exploding buildings were quite well done in fact.  It was very obvious where blue screen and rotoscoping effects were used, as the actors often looked awkwardly pasted into their environments.  Despite being largely computer generated, it has a sort of stop-motion animation feel to most effects (which I didn't particularly mind).  Indeed the entire movie has a kind of jilted feel and stuttering to the movement of even the live action characters (this old-time newsreel effect you maybe read about).  However, it seems almost like they filmed at a lower frame rate to save film.  I understand they had been going for some ""look"", but the only look they accomplished is ""cheap"".

The acting was, in a word, bad.  Devoid of any genuine emotion, every character was a caricature.  It may not be entirely the fault of the actors; perhaps the director was trying to make all performances equal so the few REALLY bad actors in the show wouldn't stand out so much.  Your average community theater production has more talent than is demonstrated here.

There were also many silly small continuity  (and common sense) issues.  For example, a special effects burning tree would fall right in front of the actor, and he kept running straight.  A building would shower debris literally a few feet from the characters and they just kinda stood there.  These, believe it or not, actually helped the film, since they were fun to point out.

All these faults could have been overlooked quite readily if the editing was even approaching decent.  Whoever edited this needs to get a new job or take some classes.  Literally 3 minutes of a guy running through various fields is more than any sane movie watcher should be expected to enjoy.  This is what ruined the movie.  It could have been decent, or fun, or interesting, or maybe even good if the simplest of editing principles were employed.

I realize, as one reviewer states, that it's ""only a movie"", but I expect movies to be entertaining.  Neither my family nor I were in any way entertained watching this.  I realize they were trying to be true to the book (which I have indeed read), but movies are not books and need to be edited as such.  Bad acting and effects don't make a film unwatchable.  In fact, it has made many films a cult hit.  I don't need great effects or big budget actors to enjoy a film.  And this might have been an enjoyable film, despite its faults, if the editing didn't make it paramount to torture to endure it.",1137888000,8,3395,4.64261744966443

I liked the idea that it followed the book and thought it would be a refreshing counter-point to Spielberg's over-the-top (and really stupid) version. I expected something like Irwin Allen level special effects and would have been satisfied with that.

From the begining, things were worse than expected. Some dolt chose to cram 3 h of movie on a DVD and I'll bet it's a single layer DVD. As a result, the video quality is awful...very jerky. Worst I've ever seen on any commercial DVD. Somebody claimed that this was done on purpose. If they wanted to make the film annoying to watch, they succeeded. The acting is mediocre at best...and best happens rarely. There is nothing special about the special effects. They don't even rise to the level one would expect of modestly talented no-budget college film student.

Do not under any circusmstances buy this turkey. Rent it for a dollar if you must and prepare to use your thumb a lot on the FF button of your remote...or get set for a long nap.

It is word for word the book as the original author, H. G. Wells wrote it. There are debates about the nature of God, but in the end, the main character discovers his belief in God and God stops the invasion, just like the book.

It was fun. It was entertaining. And it was affordable. Some scenes were very good. There was one part where all the people were fleeing the city as the Martians took over.

2311818,1,B0009PW4D2,"Having read ""The War of the Worlds"" in Junior High, it has been a part of my life since I was young. I was incredibly excitied to hear that two versions were being made for 2005: The Spielberg, up-to-date version, and a true to the book one. I was more excitied about the accurate movie, set in England at the turn of the century. At first, looking at their website and stills from the movie, it looked quite good. However once the first ""trailer"" came out, it looked like trouble.

Now to the actual movie.

It has been said that many of the reviews here are fake. It is obvious. They all talk about the other movies being un-true to the book, while this is, and they usually are defensive against other, real, negative views.

The point is, the movie is very disappointing. The special-effects, said to be up to the level of Star Wars and the Matrix, clearly are lightyears away from what is even done for special-effects on late night shows. The acting is painful since the main character is the same man, and many of the extras are used again and again, and it can be seen. They are all running in front of a greenscreen, and it gives nothing for the cinematics of the film. The camerawork is very shotty, and the music abruptly ends at parts, and the sound effects seem to be ripped off a CD you would get with a home-bought movie editor.

For the storyline of the movie, ""the most accurate re-telling of the book"" it is actually pretty well done. However, the end is rushed, and ruins the ENTIRE movie. If you are a fan of the book, you know this to be true. One minute he is in an ""empty"" London, then he is home. A whole chapter is missing. Little events, that would be noticable if you are a true fan of the book, and what should be in a fan's film, are not there. The Martian fighting machines, do not look like boilers on stilts, but look like CHICKENS. The Martians themselves are very well done, along with the handling machine. Too bad they are puppets or something.

Overall, I watch it when I am bored because it is fun, at times. Maybe it is a fun laugh. The music is quite good, perhaps the best thing about the movie. However it was done on a keyboard, and the horns and strings are terrible. If I want to see CGI men running like crazy, but floating over the same spot, being chased by moon-walking chicken tripods, this is the film to see.

And no, I am not Timbo or Susie G. In fact, they both threatened to sue me once.",1136332800,7,2442,4.274891774891775

The color filters of the film change between almost every seen and the fake mustache of the main character is hillarious. I didn't even finish watching the movie because I thought I might suffer an extensive ammount of brain damage. As previously stated in other reviews, its seems this movie was rushed and released to make a quick buck by confusing buyers with the Spielberg version or something to that effect.

This thing would have made H.G.Wells give up writing. The cheap effects and editing are bad enough. But a full 1/3 of the film is someone running through the woods or down the lane. The CGI tripods almost move in a stop action animation manner. Much of the special effects look like they were done for a Playstation or X-Box and the color of the film looks like an early cheap porn flick. It almost looks like the same special effects crew that did the Doctor Who television shows. The dialog is horrible. Even the main character's mustache looks fake & cheesy.

If you are deep into Sci-fi stay away from this. But if you love really bad movie making. This movie ranks with Vampire Men from the Lost Planet for the worse Sci-Fi movie ever made. Elvira would love this thing and it cries out for Mystery Theator 3000.

If sombody had the time they could re-edit this thing themselves and have something that is actually watchable from start to finish.

2311823,4,B0009PW4D2,"Like Peter Jackson with KING KING, the director of this WAR OF THE WORLDS wanted to make this story for years. As a result, this low-budget movie is scrupulously faithful to the book. It is set in 1898 when the book was written and is a war between alien invaders with fantastic hi-tech war machinery, such as giant walking machines on the one side, and Victorians with old cannons and pre World War One war equipment that is horse drawn.

I read that there weren't actual horses in the movie, maybe I got that wrong, but, it is not true. There may be some seams showing from time to time, but if you are at all watching the story, this won't bother 99% of the viewers. The love story at the center of the movie drives the plot.

Where as this is not the big budget Spielberg version, it has the advantage of remaining true to the book. The character is a writer, not a long shoreman. He is married and in love with his wife, not divorced. The film is long and people have said it has too much walking, (which is in the book). But of the films this last year, this movie is far more entertaining than big budget action films like Aeon Flux. I was entirely entertained by this movie.

If you don't like stories that are character driven, then you may want to re-watch DOOM with the ROCK instead. But if the characters matter to you in a story, then you will enjoy this movie. The battle scenes are powerful and sometimes tragic. I suggest this film as an entertaining evening.",1135641600,2,1475,4.336956521739131
2311824,1,B0009PW4D2,"If something must be said about the good thing (the only good thing) about this low-budget version of H.G. Wells classic, it is the most faithful version ever made. The film is set in the late 1890s, the era when the original book depicts, not the modern-day America like two famous versions made in 1952 and 2005. The filmmakers, it is obvious, love the Well's original for director Timothy Hines co-wrote, photographed, and even edited the film.

[WALK, WALK, WALK...] But the film runs for 3 hours. I couldn't believe it when I saw the words RUNTIME 180 Mins. Faithful to the book as it is, the story is so slow-moving and tedious that it bores you to death by the time you witness the aliens start to attack. What the hero of the film does is the following three - walking, talking, and crying. Sometimes he does two of them at the same time, but whatever he does, it is certain you will sleep.

[AND STRANGE COLORS] The CGIs are awful, not even the same quality as the video games you can download on the net. I don't expect much from the low-budget sci-fi film, but when I watch the tripods move like a grasshopper jumping in the field, it only makes me sad. And perhaps you should remember that with extra-care and money, you can create decent images like  that of `Sky Captain.'

But the worst thing is its colors. The picture is constantly tinted in various kinds of hues - at one time, it looks filtered with orange-colored film, another time, with green-colored, another with dark blue. The results are like looking a Grade Z films by Ed Wood film, in which the scenes switches between night and day. In this film, the characters seem as if soaked in blue water, then red, and so on and on, which makes me dizzy. You may think that your DVD player has been broken.

But the most amazing thing about the film is that here so many reviewers have already posted their opinions about the film, which indicates that lots of people have seen it like I did before or after watching the Spielberg film. My advice is this : don't repeat what I did. I don't think Tom Cruise's version is the definite one of `The War of the Worlds,' and someone should make one with its original late-Victorian settings, but as to this one, all I can say is that for all the labor the filmmakers have invested, it is not worth your own time.",1135555200,5,2325,4.422897196261682

Religiously based on the original 1898 novel, this adaptation of War of the Worlds is the only movie version to capture the story, time period and plot lines introduced to us by H. G. Wells, the father of modern science fiction.

The story is that of an everyday Writer living a middle-class Victorian life in Britain, circa 1899. The Writer witnesses the strange and peculiar events of a meteorite crash near his home. The meteorite is no ordinary meteorite. Indeed, it is a space ship for Martian creatures who are desparate for a new world to live in and, who regard the humans reigning over the Earth, as nothing more than ants, product to be used as food.

In the excitement and peril of Britain fighting off the attacking Martians, the Writer separates from his Wife to witness the thrills of war, for he is arrogant in believing the Brits will quickly wipe out the Martians. His arrogance is his undoing, as it is for the entire world, and the Writer must weather a life-defining journey to survive the threat of the Martians and reunite with his Wife.

Set in Britain at the turn of the century, this movie beautifully speaks the dialogue of H. G. Wells with wit and style. The Victorian prose illustrates the poetry of that time period. It also illustrates the complex and often stifling manners and etiquette of the Victorian era.

It is strange and exciting to see the Victorians trying to fight the martians with cannons and rifles. The tipod walkers are chilling and kind of remind me of an alien diving bell atop giant metal legs. I liked when a man was picked up and thrown into the distance. The women characters, some of them, are strong, thrue to H. G. Wells. The Spielberg version is by far the best special effects, but the movie feels somehow unfinished. The C.

It's strange that in all the talk of accuracy there's no talk of the context or subtext of Wells book. This film includes a LOT of what is inessential about Wells book while completely missing what it is really about. Elements that don't chime with the upbeat cookie cutter exploitation aims of the derivative filmmakers, like the second disturbing Artilleryman scene (where he thanks the Martians for killing the weak and leaving the strong) or the vision of the dead capital city are unceremoniously junked as if they don't matter.

Worse is the total change from Wells point of view. Someone has said that the quotes about religion come from the book. Yes, but not the context. Like everything else, the filmmakers have completely misunderstood. The character is a Christian, so talks of God, but everything he experienced, as he later admits in the epilogue that is completely cut from the film, undermines and disproves that faith. (Wells was an atheist and this book is an attack on religion and imperialism both.) Prayers go unanswered, priests go mad and the world is destroyed by science. Not only that, but the pessimism of the ending is swapped for triumph. In Wells novel it is clearly said that this is not a victory for humanity but a reprieve, that the Martians will return and possibly ultimately conquer mankind. You won't find that in the cookie cutter production line happy ending here. This is a film about bland people in waistcoats with bad accents taking on Martians, nothing more.

And this is cheap production line stuff. One reviewer said comparing this to other versions was like comparing a restaurant to McDonalds. That's unfair. This is no superbly cooked feast, it's a burnt cheeseburger that's fallen on the floor, been dragged out by the cat, chucked up and then put back in the bap in the hope you won't notice the difference.

2311843,5,B0009PW4D2,"Thanks A. Gregory for saying how it really is. I loved this movie too. It was simple, low-budget, unpretentious and exactly as H.G. Wells wrote War of the Worlds. Thank you for that, Timothy Hines. The walking machines, battles and talent overall was terrific. This War of the Worlds is more like a really good miniseries of the original novel and for all Sci-Fi and Wells fans I recommend you don't miss this movie.",1130803200,,416,4.635135135135135
2311844,5,B0009PW4D2,"I feel this version of  ""H.G. Wells The War of the Worlds"" by Timothy Hines is probably one of the most misunderstood and undervalued films released recently.

To me it had a lot of value for the following reasons:

1) Artistically it is an attempt to portray what a film would look like if it were released say in the early twenties so the tinting and special effects are very much in the tradition of that era;

2)  Anyone who has enjoyed the other ""War of the Worlds"" films inspired by H.G. Wells will be fascinated by comparing this version which is much closer to the actual manuscript by Wells.

3)  Having seen this film I'm convinced that Wells himself would be most pleased with it.",1130630400,2,691,4.436507936507937
2311845,4,B0009PW4D2,I loved this version of The War Of The Worlds. It is set in the proper time the the story was meant to be told in.

2311846,1,B0009PW4D2,"I'll avoid commenting on the various personal attacks and innuendo that have been directed at Mr. Hines himself. The internet being what it is, it's hard to separate fact from rumor sometimes. It's not neccesary, however, to delve into accusations in regards to Mr. Hines character in order to pan his version of War of the Worlds. It's admirable that he set out to do the story in its original form, and attempted to deliver the first faithful adaptation of H.G. Well's seminal novel. Unfortunately, what he's ultimately delivered just might be the worst film of the decade. The story's there, that much can be said. But practically none of the other elements come together to properly service it. The acting and cinematography are so ametuerish that it's hard to believe that Mr. Hines has had a career behind the camera, even in television commercials. Frames strain and quiver to contain the simplest of motions, at times, and in others the picture quality looks barely above that of consumer level home video. The musical score alone has been praised but it's so over-bearingly loud in the film that it begins to grate the nerves. And then comes the matter of the dialogue track, the actors seem muted, as if we're listening to them with ears packed with gauze. One screening of this by its director should have prompted a new sound mix prior to release. And now, to the special effects. Mr. Hines depends heavily on CGI to tell his story, which would have been fine had the graphics not been so incompetently crafted. And early scene of the ""narrator"" driving his horse and buggy at night with a computer matted background is a grim harbinger of things to come. If Mr. Hines can't convincingly potray a horse and buggy ride, how can he hope to depict an alien invasion with towering Martian tripods laying waste to turn of the Century England? Witness the battle between a pair of Martian tripods and the ""Thunder Child"" warship. To see it is to see awfulness in its purest form. In this mind-numbingly long three hour feature, one sequence alone stands out as being relatively effective. The ""narrator"" and a priest are trapped beneath the rubble of a house demolished by a landing Martian cylinder. The desperation and horror the two men experience there is fairly well communicated, despite the limitations of the production. If only that could be said for more of this film. Mr. Hines can't complain. He realized his life long dream of making ""War of the Worlds"", and though it failed to secure theatrical distribution, it got a fairly wide video release. He had a good opportunity, and unfortunately, he squandered it.",1130371200,9,2629,4.805739514348786

The fact that there are movie-maker wannabes out there who throw together a similarly titled movie to a bigger 'blockbuster' hit and release it at the same time (or before) is starting to really become annoying. They're hoping to cash in on the success of something they could never be good enough to make.

There should be some kind of special section in movie rental stores for this kind of rubbish. You know how they have an adult section with opaque cases to prevent anyone from accidentally becoming offended by mature content? They should do the same for this kind of crap.

There is a lot of realy bad c.s.o used, the cgi horses are laughable and the acting could be better. Though it gets better later ( think the actors must have been getting used to it )

Dont look too close or you will notice the non authentic details in this like the modern diesel loco with steam engine sound effects springs to mind and there are the royal artillary troops with WW2 US chip hats and other bits of kit that are just not right.

Guess I noticed the uniform probs due to being a WW2 reenactor here in uk ( I've worn those hats while playing US in battles )

The only other main niggles is the almost contuinuous music in the film which gets annoying after a while.

In the plus file at least they had a go at doing it and its cheap so I'm glad I bought it Pity I had to get it from the states tho It had not been released in Uk

2311868,2,B0009PW4D2,"Let me just say I'm a HUGE fan of WOTW, I've read the book many times (It's one of those stories I just never get tired of) I used to listen to the Jeff Wayne musical when I was a kid, and I've now seen every movie version of this classic masterpiece; the 1952 Byron Haskin/George Pal classic; the new Spielberg one; the David Latt Asylum splatterfest, also released this year, and this one.

  Ever since I was at school I wanted to see a period remake set in the original time and location of the book, but was disapointed at how this one was carried out, I wasn't expecting mind-blowing effects but I would have expected at least semi-professional effects but this looked rushed or like it was done by college students, the designs of London and Woking were totally inaccurate and I know its been mentioned a lot here but skeletons cannot thrash around as they have no muscles or tendons or anything, the costumes weren't too bad though, but I can generally overlook bad SFX if the acting and story telling is good but the British accents would have been insulting if they weren't so funny (Surley they could have found some English actors in the area) and they were given huge chunks of narrative to be spoken as dialogue, and spend minutes telling us what we have already seen or are seeing on the screen.

  I have to give 2 stars just because Tim Hines was so passionate about this and I'm sure he really wanted to do a good job, but lack of decent editing, amature SFX and embarrasing acting really bring it down. I won't say ""Don't buy this"" , because some people may like it, but I would recommend reading the book, and seeing the Spielberg film (OK its set in America in the present day, and there is a really annoying twist which does not hold up under scrutiny, but it still captures the terror and menace of the 1898 book).

IMO this film requires:

1) Good Special Effects.

2) Higher quality acting with better known actors.

3) Tighter editing.

If these 3 points had been improved on, this would have been a much better film, even better than Senor Spielbergo's version.

As it stands Tim Hines version is decent if you can get past the above 3 points and concentrate on H G Well's underlying story.

2311870,2,B0009PW4D2,"I am a great fan of the War of The Worlds Story and Timothy Hines undertook a tremendous effort to release his film, albeit too hastily. I suspect that with the pressure of Steven Spielberg's high budget redo of this story he forced the movie into the market place prematurely; He should have waited to bring his vision to the screen with a better budget.

If one can view this movie from the perspective of a person with very little money trying to bring a dream to life it can be appreciated from that perspective. It is very low budget and at times tedious, as there was very little editing to bring certain scenes to the point more quickly. Also, Mr. Hines employs a schizophrenic use of an old film jerky effect in addition to overexposure glare effects in an effort to hide repetitive scenery and CGI effects that didn't quite work. It appears that he tried to make poor production quality look ""arty"" but succeeded in lowering the overall appeal of the film.

However, there are a few moving moments when the acting is pretty good especially towards the climax of the film. If the viewer can allow their imagination to fill in what his budget wouldn't allow, this movie is enjoyable. There are some nice CGI effects of the War Machines and the Aliens are very strange.

As I said I am a fan of the story and I appreciate the tremendous effort that Timothy Hines put forth in producing this movie. Upon reviewing the credits at the end, the actors and extras were the  largest number of production personnel. Mr. Hines and a scant few people to work with and did achieve some flashes of greatness with the film.

The movie is a point by point adaptation of the book as written. The director, Timothy Hines, doesn't get in the way of his material. His movie is surreal with vibrant colors that feel like an old photograph. His special effects are surreal as well. They are mostly well used to depict the martian, one-hundred-feet-high tripod fighting machines.  The use of colors is almost identical to the way Terry Gilliam used them in THE BROHTER'S GRIM. It's as if the two movies had the same color specialist. The use of heavy yellow or red filters or images having a silvery quality. There are other similarities to Gilliam's style. Hines has a knack for revealing the unexpected, and in unexpected ways. The movie also lulles you into its depth at a measured pace, reflective of a more leasurely world of the past. In this movie, moter cars are in their infancy. When the Victorians are met with a sophisticated alien enemy with superior technology, they are beaten. Not without a fight. The soldiers are handled with dignity as they face battles they cannot win. There is a sad underbelly to this movie. This aspect of the movie may cause some to squirm, but the pain and suffering is well presented and tastefully without losing the horror war brings.

2311883,1,B0009PW4D2,"You know, I really, REALLY wanted to love this film. I loved the idea that someone was (for once) going to be true to the original work by Well's. However, even in the build up to this film's release in Spring 05 a lot of things were just not adding up.

Continued delays in the release, a disturbing difficulty to find any evidence that there were going to be a cinema release, etc (more on this later). So I blindly bought this title on DVD in Walmart last week and here's what I've found.

I knew I had to be prepared for modest effects, as I'd heard the film was low budget. However, this doesn't begin to describe the problems with this film! The effects are sadly the best thing about this film (and believe me the effects are BAD, that's the real chilling part to this tale). The acting all round is .....very limited.....I wouldn't quite say awful, but it's really not much above that. But there is just so much of this film that is wrong. There is absolutely NO ATTENTION to detail here! Costumes are a mix of time periods, props and backgrounds sometimes contain modern day materials (check out the chairs in the restaurant scene) and there are big gaps in this supposed 'true adaptation' of Well's classic (our hero never makes it to London).

Now I'm not particularly clever or good at observing smart editing, but even I can see how 'patchy' and utterly amateur the final cut is. I kid you not, large and agonizingly long scenes in the film consist of characters `running about' and doing nothing for the plot at all. It would appear that any scene that was shot made it into the film. Scenes switch to blatantly obvious different times of the day as the light in scenes switches erratically. As bad as this film is, simple attention to editing could have turned it from a three hour film to a two hour film that was just as bad, but without wasting another hour of my life.

I want to believe this film was made by enthusiasts on a limited budget, but you really can't see any signs of love and care to detail in any aspect of this film. When you take into account the strange and mysterious `rave reviews' that appear on these pages for this film (and the even more suspicious, a regular 4 reviews a day that appear), you quickly realize that certain powers (presumably Mr. Hines himself) are working hard to con people into parting with their money.  If only he had put this much effort into making a REAL movie about H.G. Well's novel.

I presume Mr. Hines is reading this, as he prepares to put another 4 fake reviews on these pages (notice how each rave review is the ONLY review done by that person?).

Not only have these people lost almost completely their civilized ways, but just being under the oppression of the Martians makes them as animals are to human beings: lesser beings. It also shows how the war is almost not a war and more of a termination of us, but still a war because we fight back even when losing.

If you like Victorian-period dramas and / or sci-fi, you'll love this one! If you like enjoying a film solely based on budget and star names, avoid this one like the plague. This movie is fresh and unique and not for trivial souls.

This film is a faithful adaptation of HG's book. A noble cause, that looks like it was put together by a very talented production group who really respected the original novel their film was based on. Aside from basic story highlights, some of which have been posted already, here are a couple of major points of delight.

The main actor played two characters: The lead protagonist (the writer), and the writer's brother. The difference between the two is so clear I didn't know he played two characters until I watched the credits. The writer character was older and warmer in life than his younger cerebral-orientated medical university student brother. The actor who played these two roles was very talented.

As mentioned numerous times before, the CGI effects are low budget, surreal and arresting. When the martians unleash their heat-ray, people turn into trippy, Grateful Dead dancing Skeletons. Completely clean of any tissue, these skeletons writhe and dance and the martian heat-ray ravishes their picked-clean corpes. The build up to this scene is almost too sad and emotional to watch.

This movie is 3 hours long. I am not exaggerating. No chapter of the book was left behind in the telling of the story. They kept the dog entering the collapsed house, which I loved and YES WE REALLY DID NEED TO HAVE THAT SCENE!

There are several scenes of people riding horses and in horse-drawn carriages. The horses are beautiful. There is actually one scene where you see the elphinstones pony - some bandits steal it from the writer's brother. You can see that it is an actual miniature horse and pony chaise! This looked identical to the drawings that accompannied the original novel over a hundred years ago!

When it takes 50 minutes for the Martian cyclinder to open, you know these poor deluded fools don't know the first thing about how to make a film. I doubt they even had a script.

If you like Mystery Science Theater-style mocking of films, you'll love this one!  If you like enjoying a good film, avoid this one like the plague.

Sure, it's a faithful adaptation of HG's book.  A noble cause, but it looks like it was put together by my High-School Thespian Troop.  Aside from basic directing gaffes (time of day changing in the middle of scenes, music chopping off abruptly between cuts, bad jump cuts, bad matches on action), here are a couple of major points of awfulness, some of which have been posted already:

The main actor plays two characters:  The lead protagonist (the writer), and the writer's brother.  The only difference between the two is that ""The Writer"" has a moustache.  A REALLY obviously FAKE moustache.  A REALLY obviously FAKE moustache that is STILL his only facial hair after being trapped under a house for 15 days.

As mentioned numerous times before, the CGI effects are awful.  When the martians unleash their heat-ray, people turn into trippy, Grateful Dead dancing Skeletons.  Completely clean of any tissue, these skeletons continue to writhe and dance.  Apparently, they felt the spirit of Jerry in 1898.

This movie is 3 hours long.  Fully 30 minutes of the film is footage of various characters running around outdoors.  I am not exaggerating.  There is one scene where the writer is evacuating his house.  He leaves his wife to go check on his neighbors, and runs to their house for about 5 minutes.  He gets there, knocks on the door for about 3 seconds, decides they're not home, then runs back to the carriage for another 5 minutes.  DID WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE THAT SCENE!?!

There are several scenes of people riding in horse-drawn carriages.  You never really see the horses that are pulling those carriages, except in distant shots, and the horses are CGI (really bad CGI).  There is actually one scene where you see the horse - some bandits steal it from the writer's brother.  In one long, oddly shot scene, you can see that it is a midget pony!  I'm not talking about a young horse.  I'm talking about the 3' tall horses that you put kids on at petting zoos.

Humans become ants as the Martians annihilate and corral humankind for their own uses. Every man, woman and child must fight to survive The War of the Worlds.

However, when people burn and all of the flesh is gone, the skeletons should not continue to move in a drawn out-overacted death sequences (hint: skeletons need muscles to move).

To sum up the areas where this production falls short:

CGI: Woeful, woeful, and woeful. Images are poorly composited and low in polygons resulting in a 'cartoonish' look to almost every scene. The War machines had tentacles that were stiff like pipe cleaners and the Martians themselves looked like 2 dimensional paper cut-outs.

The Thunder Child battle was a disaster with animation hastily dropped over live plates of water where a boat wake is plainly visible most of the time travelling sideways under the animated Iron-Clad which had little or no wake of it's own.

Starry skys are visible during the day and colour washes were inconsistent leaving the viewer wondering if it was day or night most of the time. The whole 'Victorian storybook' effect just became hard on the eyes very quickly.

The computer game based around Jeff Wayne's album which was released quite some time ago, outdoes this film on every level of animation.

Editing: What editing...? The film is slow, ponderous and suffers from recurrent re-use of scenes involving actors walking from one place to another, on the same stretch of road. The editors obviously had no concept of pacing and continuity, as the film jumps awkwardly amongst the main characters with no real logic.

Acting: The only actor I felt that was really trying to do his best was the gentleman playing Ogilvy, more's the pity. The others were just trying.

The Narrator engendered no feeling of sympathy within me and I almost found myself wishing the Martians would just take him out to finish things off in a hurry. And what about that moustache???

Using the same actor in the role of the narrator's brother (no moustache) became confusing and just seemed contrived in order to try and fit everything in amongst the endless 'walking from here to there' scenes.

The Parson/Curate character constantly whinging about how hungry he was while his mouth was packed FULL of bread were just laughable.

Constant re-use of actors in crowd scenes resulted in more confusion as people that had died in a previous scene were often to be found milling about again minutes later.

It appears from all of this that the director had little or no control over this disaster of a disater film. I have honestly seen student and amatuer films of better quality done with far less money and resources.

I was pleased to read in the credits that no animals were harmed during the making of the film, as I daresay the viewing audience will require therapy.

I have yet to see the Spielberg/Cruise version, although it would appear to detract from the original H.G. Wells novel.

2311952,5,B0009PW4D2,The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells was the first story to explore the chances of there possibly being life on other planets. What happens in this movie is that there were aliens from Mars or Martians if you prefer that landed on English soil in a town called Woking. The Martians' main goal of coming here was not the destruction of mankind but the occupation of the planet Earth and the corraling of mankind to be of use as a food source. Martians pummeled the planet and the humans and battles and survivalistic struggles ensued. Fantastic!

The acting is wooden and the effects tragic. People burst into flame and burn- but their clothes and hair are unscortched. The other CGI looks like a 1990 PC game... except worse. Look up the director's name, and you'll find ONE other cinematic credit, and it's from Troma (the folks that brought you the Toxic Agenger series). So, no wonder.

This is an object lesson in why the studio system sometimes works. All it really needed was someone to occasionally say, ""Tim, this is rubbish"", ""Tim, that guy cannot act and his accent is risible,"" or at the very least, ""Tim, you've just shown that. You don't need to have two characters discuss it in detail for the next six minutes.""

The actual individual shots are generally pretty competent, it's just the editing, acting, pacing, and every other aspect of the film you can think of that plumb the depths of toe-curling ineptitude. Some FX sequences - I'm thinking especially of the Thunderchild - genuinely would have been more effective if they'd been done in a water tank with plastic models.

In fact, this is one of the most galling things about WotW - if Hines had had the intelligence to *play up* the stilted acting, the wonky effects and the bizarre towns that consist of half a dozen houses scattered around fields at random and maybe desaturate the colour a bit, he'd have had something a bit like a low-rent Guy Maddin movie going here.

As it is, it's such an incredible ordeal from start to finish that the mere fact that it even *exists* makes you wonder about Hines' mental wellbeing, given the vast amount of time and effort that appears to have gone into it. My friend's three-year-old daughter could spot that this was nonsense - why couldn't anyone involved in the production?",1124755200,8,1645,4.78169014084507

This COULD have been an interesting period based peice, this COULD have been true to the vision and story Wells crafted, or this COULD have been honestly marketed as a B-ish movie somewhat based on Well's story. To be fair, this failing to visually re-create a book is not new. All too often the rights to a prose based story are purchased in the interest of producing a movie version, but the movie at best falls short, or at worst is simply leveraging an established title or author but producing something that has little or no connection to the book. This movie relies on very poor CGI to attempt to force the immagry that Wells was able to create with words alone. It is disappointing, and does not make up for any of the many failings of this movie. Watch this without the title, and it's an ammusing B-Movie. Watch this expecting Wells, and be sure to have something better to do while it's running, like matching grey socks, counting the spare change in the furniture cushions, or attempting to match toenail clippings to the toes they came from.",1124668800,5,1121,4.582089552238806
2311965,5,B0009PW4D2,"I have watched the movie three times. I love it. It's one of my favorites movies of all time. The script is brilliant.

Anthony Piana is excellent. He shows that he can handle to play the leading role. You always know what he feels and thinks even when he's not talking.

The movie has also other very good actors. Jack Clay as Ogilvy gives such an impressive.

Susan Goforth as the Wife of the Narrator is very short in the movie but gives a good performance.

James Lathrop as the Artilleryman and John Kaufmann as the Curate are also amazing. And Darlene Renee Sellers as Mrs. Elphonstone and Jamie Lynn Sease (quite the hottie!) as Miss Elphinstone are very touching in their performances.

I think this movie is a little bit better than big budget Hollywood movie because it told a complete story. It has a lot of touching scenes. If you cry sometimes at movies you will cry at this movie.

I can not really understand why the movie is getting so much derision in some of the reviews. I think it's a REALLY good movie.

I think Timothy Hines is a brilliant director. I look forward to more of movies by him.

The special effects are perhaps the worst I've seen since the fifties.

2311977,2,B0009PW4D2,"What can I say? I'm a big fan of HG Wells' War of the Worlds story and was glad to see the original 1989 setting rendered to film. They stuck really close to the original story and that was refreshing.

On the other hand, it was disapointing that the editors seemed to have such a love for everything they shot that it seemed like they couldn't bring themselves to edit anything out. The movie dragged by. And I mean this is a slow moving film. They could have edited out so much extra stuff out that the film would have been an hour and a half rather than 3 hours. The film is chock full of long slow scenes that do nothing to further the plot but rather make the film rather boring I'm sorry to say.

Special effects. Lets talk about the special effects.

The alien and the mechanical tripods were pretty cool but the other effects (like riding on a horse and buggy and the scenes with the warships on the water (OMG!!) were Sooooo bad I thought I was watching a film made in the 60's rather than a film made in 2005! When you see the boats you'll see what I mean! They looked like toy models being dragged sideways accross a swiming pool set with land painted on sheets in the background. And the heat ray? They seemed to enjoy superemposing scenes of fire over scenes of people and then instructing the actors to writhe in pain. It was that bad. I thought that even basic special effects had come a long way from the ""Dr. Who"" effects this film seems to use over and over again. It was pretty funny in a sad way.

OK, so to summ up, the plot was there and the aliens and tripods were true to the story. But the movie dragged on far far too long - about half of it could have been cut out without damaging the plot. As for the special effects, they might have wanted to hire someone with modern effects skills and maybe the film would be salvagable. If you are an MST3k fan, you will probably enjoy this. Unfortunatly the long boring parts and the really bad special effects turned this great story into a disapointment to watch.",1124496000,7,2032,4.256476683937824
2311978,3,B0009PW4D2,"As a great fan of the H. G. Well's book 'War of the Worlds' I have always been surprised (and a little disappointed) that a film version placing it in its orginal setting of England at the turn of the 19th/20th century had not been made.  But that is not to disparage the 1953 and 2005 versions both of which I thoroughly enjoy.

Well now we have one how well has it been done and how does it compare?  Not at all badly actually.  Clearly done on a much smaller budget than either the George Pal or Steven Spielberg films it can't begin to compete when it comes to special effects.  The acting also isn't to the same standard.  But that said this is very worthy effort that stays very close to the original book and what it may lack in the special effects and acting departments it more than makes up for in the obvious enthusiasm and dedication that has gone into its making.  This has clearly been a labour of love by all those concerned.

My overall impression is that this film is really one for the Sci-Fi (and particulary H. G. Wells') enthusiast rather than a general audience.

What a LAME thing to do... Shame on you guys... You really must be deperately pathetic to stoop so... but HEY, guys like you don't care about ethics -- so, why should I waste my time writing this paragraph, RIGHT..!!!

If anyone reading this has any thoughts of buying this DVD -- just sort the reviews from LOWEST TO HIGHEST, and read the low ones first. I think that'll put you on the right track.

As far as a remedy -- Amazon should at least post the number of reviews that that reviewer has posted along with each review (no biggy). It might also be a good idea to require people to use their real names -- I know I use mine...

Again, just read the lowest reviews before you buy -- a good thing to do when buying any DVD.",1124323200,3,1249,4.32051282051282

2311999,1,B0009PW4D2,"An interesting film, and I'm glad I've seen it; if only for the hint at what Spielberg's blockbuster might have been.

The plus point of this film is it's faithful adaptation of Wells' novel, set in late Victorian England invaded by Martians in ballistic projectiles, wielding heat-rays from their tripod fighting machines. By no means invulnerable, they nevertheless easily overpower any military force sent against them until brought low by mankind's unseen allies.

Unfortunately, the down side is virtually everything else.

At three hours plus, the film is simply too long and slow, the acting tends to the over-earnest and then there's the special effects. This is where the low budget Hines had is most evident. The imagination behind the CGI fighting machines and Martians cannot be faulted, however the execution leaves a lot to be desired: what is presented here as a finished effect would hardly pass muster as an animatic anywhere else. The CG elements have no additional surface texture and do not interact well with the rest of the image; for instance there is no splash when a tripod enters water, Thunder Child leaves no wake and the Thames flows disconcertingly through her, and you're never entirely sure what is supposed to be exploding from where the flames appear.

All in all, a valiant attempt, but if only...

The definitive War of the Worlds film has yet to be made.",1124323200,3,1391,4.952789699570816

2312004,3,B0009PW4D2,"This is the first complete movie of the original H.G. Wells novel set in victorian Britan.  As such, it certainly covers everything.

The film is sadly crippled somewhat by poor cgi effects that often look like the raw unfinished computer models (without complex texture-mapping) that would have benefited the impact of the film if done better.  Apparently, the $30,000,000 budget got disatrously slashed after negotiations with Dreamworks fell through.  The standing budget was slashed down to about 7 mil and thats why the effects were incomplete/redone.

The acting is not too bad but obviously it's in the league of many Amicus and Hammer productions from the UK.

The music score really ruins this film in my opinion.  Not that it's bad music--it's not, it's quite good.  It's just not WOTW, and the midi orchestra is way too loud and densely orchestrated so that it steps on the dialogue quite a bit.  What a shame that Joel Goldsmith (who was to orignally score the film for it's theatrical release) was no longer available for budgetary reasons.  I have no ill will towards the composer but this chap should have at least studied the book a bit before tackling this.  And maybe check-out some other similar period scores by the greats (""First Men in the Moon"" comes to mind).  Maybe if it had been scored with a live orchestra...?

Enough about the music!  I think the most well-done part of this rather long film (at least they didn't make it an 88 min straight-to-video wonder!) is the scene in the farmhouse, looking into the pit.  The acting in these scenes is quite good actually and the whole part of it is pretty close to what Wells intended.  It is particularily gruesome when the poor captured young opera singer from earlier in the film has her bodily jucies drained while being hopelessly restrained by the martians.  I am not a gore freak and so I think this part was tastefully done and true to Well's novel.

The opening is rather longer than it should be and Ogilvy seems a bit too much like 'nutty' Prof. Cavor from ""First Men in the Moon"" than the wise and studied Ogilvy of the novel.

What Speilberg managed to achieve in his great film version was the mood Wells was trying to convey in the story and that was afterall the novel's whole intention, embodied in the Speilberg-Cruise version.  WOTW was actually an allegory on man's inhumanity to man and the genocide of various indigenous peoples as part of Britian's empire building in the 18th and 19th centuries.  A much more powerful people anhilating a much more primitive people through vastly superior weaponery with no communication or reason, just simple genocide.  Unfortunately only some of this coldness and juggernaut-like advancing of the martians comes through in this Pendragon version.

All that said, I am greatful to the filmakers for persevering and pushing through with all the problems this production has seen to bring Well's timeless complete story to the screen (even the 'small' one!) set properly in it's victorian setting.  It would seem that big-budget Hollywood will not have anything to do with 'period dramas'.  Too bad, because setting this story back then amplifies the message of the book which speaks to all generations.

So pick up a copy of this!  If you are a fan of the George Pal film you will at least see what he sadly had to leave out and appreciate the menacing 'tripod' walkers which crash through buildings and stomp on fleeing people like ants.

There are a few who have attacked this movie production for years. As others have pointed out, everybody who has followed this thing pretty much knows that now.

These few attackers think that people shouldn't like this movie. They are continually dumbfounded that the movie got into the top 20 sellers on Amazon. They don't believe that it has continued to outsell the 50's version and the quickie Asylum version. Well it has sold. It is selling. That is obvious to all but this small band of attackers. They just can't believe that there are many many people who bought this movie. Watched this movie. Loved this movie. Wrote good reviews of this movie.

I personally know people who wrote good reviews for this movie after seeing it, only to told by this small band of attackers that their reviews were fake. They have said people should only trust the ""real name"" reviews. Crap. You don't have to give your credit card buying info to Amazon to write a review. And just becuase you didn't, doesn't mean you are not a buyer. I have bought many books, CD's and movies from Amazon and I don't have to review under my credit card account. Again crap.

I loved this movie. I am writing this good review as the movie deserves it. The people who worked on it deserve it. The people who backed and supported it deserve it. My name is Shaune Bratton. I live in Montana. I am real as the day is long. I loved this movie. Obviously so did giant numbers of people.

This movie has class, style, inventiveness, excitement, tensity, and charm. The characters are all engaging and fun to follow.

The Martian invaders are EXACTLY as the book said they should look. They also behave as the book said to. They are very cool and worth the price of the DVD.

2312013,4,B0009PW4D2,"I bought and viewed H. G. Wells' The War Of The Worlds a few weeks ago. I very strongly enjoyed it. I love the Writings of Wells and and have read many of his works. I also watch alot of movies. Maybe twenty a week. As such, I get the chance to see many kinds of movies of varying qualities. As such, I have to say that this movie is one of the freshest one of a kind movies to come along in years.

It is not an Ed Wood movie. That claim comes from the odd small parade of attackers that have been attacking this version through the years of development. They are an odd little paranoid bunch.

Some think they are a small group of crazy obsessives that are jealous of the filmmaker.

Others think they work for Paramount or Dreamworks or one of the companies affiliated with the Spielberg version.

It appears some mainstream reporters have now documented some of the latter.

Virtually nobly thinks these attackers are reposting the same reviews on Amazon and other places just because the filmmaker missed some deadlines. I could write a novel about the claims of Hollywood companies shifting their statements with the sands as their pictures develop.

For me, I think it is a combination. If I were going to hire somebody to trash a film in competition with my film, I would hire obsessive loony birds who would be passionate about trashing the competition. It appears that's what we have. I have read many such attacks when two films are in competition. It goes with the business.

But back to H. G. Wells' The War Of The Worlds. The movie is like an aged Victorian photograph. It is well directed and acted. The filmmakers never let their budget get in the way and clearly have a passion for Wells. Lower budget films often fail due to the technology. This film suffers somewhat from the quality of the Special Effects. They are not wires and masking tape of old, but the CGI reveals sometimes.

However, it is clear that the filmmakers knew what they had and compensated for this. The result is a stylized, surreal film that is not distant, but easy to follow. The key to the film's success, is that they focused on the characters in the story.

You care about these people and what they think and feel about the their world (our world in another time and place) coming to an end. Some, a few will be bored, becuase the film asks you to engage your brain. So few films do that now days that people are forgetting what it is like to be involved in a story. As opposed to simply letting it flow over you and forgetting it five minutes later.

I, like many others I 've read the comments of, were moved by this film or didn't relate. But then later, realized they couldn't stop thinking about the film. I see many who watched it. Didn't connect with it, and then watched it two or three more times.

that is the case with me. It is one of the few films that I have watched more than once. It has become a part of my keeper video collection.

There is a deep tragedy running through the film that speaks the truth. Some who are cut off from their emotions will be disturbed by this. But most will welcome a refreshing honesty about war and invasion and how hold it together, or don't hold it together.",1124064000,6,3205,4.386172006745363
2312014,1,B0009PW4D2,"First things first.  This is an actual honest review from a real person who has actually reviewed other movies.  Thus, you'll find potential spoilers in this review, but above all, some actual information about why I liked or disliked this movie, frequently in detail, as opposed to the plethora of fake reviews here.  Some of these fake reviews even go so far as to claim the negative ones the fake ones.  If this is so, then why is it that this relatively little known movie has managed to collect over 500 reviews in the short time it's been out (with over 350 positive reviews by people that have never posted reviews of anything else), while the famous (read: well known) George Pal classic version that's been out for years has only received 150 reviews in total?  More on that later.

Where to start? I guess I could go for the good points...

They managed to point the camera at the actors without it wandering all over like all these ""trendy"" directors like to do so often these days to cover up the fact that they don't know what they're doing. The camera work here managed to frame things without detracting from the scenes for a fair amount of the movie. A few jolts appear here & there when something blows up, which wasn't done all that well (probably added in post - if you can call it that), but overall the camera work is about about the least offensive thing here.

Similarly, the lighting isn't bad. It could be much better though, like all those day-for-night shots that are so obviously shot during the day.  This appears to have been filmed mostly outdoors, or against blue/green screen, and then tweaked in post. They were apparently going after an old, sepia toned look for this and they came close once in a while.  The other colors they used are another story.

That's it for the good points.

This movie was abviously done for next to nothing. It's evident from the use of obvious non-actors throughout, who seem confused about where to look, what's supposed to be happening around them, or even what they should be doing. In what should be intense scenes, like when the martians first attack, a crowd of people just stand around, obviously waiting for someone to tell them to run, and they look like they're waiting for this command, rather than reacting to this big event that's supposed to be going on in front of them. Even as they're being fired upon, they just stand around and half-heartedly writhe in horribly fake agony, as poorly composited fire is ""burning"" them alive. Oh, and that fire is drastically out of scale as well. Most of the people have a dazed & confused look on their face all the time, probably the exact same expression viewers have while watching this.

The martian war machines are designed half decently, but that's about all. They're animated so poorly you have no idea what they're supposedly trying to do. Their actions hae no apparent purpose other than to move randomly.  The interaction with live and CG environments is also so bad, this thing should be taking a top spot on the gallery abominate site. For example, a tripod walks into a farmhouse, and the leading arms/tentacles, etc. actually pass, very obviously, through the walls for a second before the house is animated to collapse - something that's inexcusable in 3D animation.

The martians themselves look like piles of goo (to be polite) with wormlike tentacles and huge eyes that are also poorly done. The appear to have been rendered at a very low resolution and then scaled up to fit the backgrounds since they are always blurry. They could really do with some higher quality texturing and some lighting by someone that has some skill. In fact, all the lighting for the 3D elements was abysmal. The original Doom game was done far better.

Compositing (combining 3D, CGI, effects into live action sequences) was horrible. No attempts seem to have been made to match motion with background anywhere. Shadows are not added to try to place the effects into the scenes, and in fact, almost every scene with any effects whatsoever has been processed so badly that all sense of depth has been removed. The original pit that the first pod is found in is a perfect example. It's only seen from the side, and no attempt is made to define how large it is, except through the inexperienced reactions of the ""actors"" mulling around. Someone falls in, and the only way to see where the edge of the pit actually is is by watching for when this poor guy climbs out of it a couple times. Even then, it looks like he's just been added to a scene of piles of sand.

An extremely pathetic compositing attempt is made just before the main character gets on a paddleboat.  I had to play this scene a few times to actually figure out what I was looking at.  It's a three part comp, and none of the elements match the others.  The foreground is the main character standing on a hill, looking down into a field.  At the other end of the field, clearly about half a mile distance, is a line of trees.  The next element is placed above those trees, and is supposed to appear behind them.  However, that element is of a paddleboat, from a point of view looking UP!  And this is towering above the trees.  The person standing on this boat, which is comped in beyond the trees, now appears to be well over 100 feet tall, dwarfing the trees in front of him.  Finally, the third element, the lake, is added behind all this, and this lake element is viewed from an agle of about 45 degrees, DOWN.  So we have a field that is on a gentle incline, going down toward the giant paddleboat that towares above the trees, that looks like it's beached itself so the front is way higher than the back, and behind that we have a lake that appears to be going uphill on a steep incline, and drifts out of sync with the rest of the frame when the camera moves.

The worst is during a scene on a paddleboat as a battleship, the Thunderchild, (which looks like it was modeled using a bathtub toy for reference) races by, unrealistically fast, as martian machines are, um, I don't know what they were doing exactly - looking menacing? Anyway, these were composited so badly I actually thought this section was filmed and accidentally exposed twice. And the shots of the paddleboat looked more like they took a photo of house and swapped the landscape around it with water, without any regard for the drastically different perspectives.

The same with the battleship as it went by. Its angle was from a such a higher vantage point than the background it was placed into that near the end of the shot, this thing was obviously about to take flight (another few frames and it would literally be above the horizon). Then there's the shots of both boats actually travelling sideways (the Thunderchild actuall appears to turn and skid in one), with absolutely no interaction with the water.

Finally, most of the scenes in this thing have a very distracting jumpiness to them. Every fifth frame is dropped and replaced with a copy of the fourth frame. This makes it look like you're watching a bad MPG or AVI on a computer that can't play video very well. It makes any scenes with a lot of movement very hard to watch, especially scenes where the camera pans.

This thing is BAD. I bought it due to a few ""glowing"" reviews here, and after seeing some of it, I just had to check a few more to make sure I wasn't remembering things wrong. Several reviewers actually nailed it... Tim Hines or his cronies are obviously shilling this piece of trash with several fake reviews. I tested his theory and it appears solid. Just click the ""See all my reviews"" link beside any of the positive reviews and you see that in virtually every case, that is the only review that person has written. Now, what are the chances of a hundred-plus people all coming together to give glowing reviews about this little-known bad movie, and not writing any reviews for anything else?

Don't believe me? Try it yourself. Find a positive review and check the link for all the other reviews. Now, check the reviews that are less than positive. In most cases, those reviewers will have posted other reviews for other films. Now, check another movie - one that's better known, and do this same test. Chances are that all those reviewers (positive or negative) will have more than just one review to their credit. This is a test I will definitely be doing myself from now on.

Going over all the pages of reviews I can't help but notice pattern - one that others have also noticed. After a few real reviews of the movie (virtually all negative) from people - most using real names with other reviews to their credits, a block of 4-5 star positive review turns up, just enough to push the real reviews off the first page. Virtually none of these rave reviews are by people that are using real names, or have even reviewed another movie anywhere on the site (and this is easily checked as I mentioned previously - click the ""read all my reviews"" link beside the names). Sure enough, shortly after  a couple bad reviews were posted, what did I see? Three positives, all by people that aren't using the Real Name system, and who have never reviewed anything else on the site.

Another real review followed, again, very negative, by someone that's got other reviews to his credit. And the pattern repeats, with SIX glowing reviews, and only one of those used the real name system. That one reviewer is the only one of the bunch that has even reviewed anything else. Amazon should really prevent people from placing reviews without using the Real Name system, since the current method, as evidenced by the sheer number of obvious fake reviews here, is being abused by the shills to trick people into paying money for a product that is simply garbage.

This not only hurts customers who buy this under the artificial impression that the product is good, since they see only the latest batch of fake reviews on the first page, but it's also a detriment to Amazon itself, since this is essentially false advertising. The reviews placed on Amazon are testimonials, and testimonials are advertising, whether paid for or not. Amazon should at least take steps to ensure these testimonials are honest ones - not faked just to hide the honest ones.

I paid money for this piece of trash. Money I would NOT HAVE PAID had I seen some of the real reviews that were pushed off the first page when I placed the order. In essense, because of false claims on the pages of Amazon, I bought a product that was far inferior to the claims I read about it. I was lied to about the quality of this DVD, and it wasn't untl it arrived a few days later and I was able to play it that I realized those reviews were completely false.

I returned to Amazon to re-check those reviews that made it seem like this was such a great film, and was lucky enough to catch the latest offering of real reviews, all stating in detail how pathetic this thing was. Another hour later, those reviews were pushed to the second page as another packet of fake ones was posted.  Another batch of shallow, ""this movie is great"" with no real reasons given, by first-time reviewers, who have put about as much effort into their ""reviews"" as went into this crappy movie.  Even someof their personal information is lame, like the one from Ontario, Canada, USA...  Um, newsflash...  Canada is NOT a state in the US. And Ontario is a province of Canada (as well as a county in California).  At least try to claim a location that actually exists!

These spammers (since this is basically what they are) know that the majority of people will only bother to read the reviews that are on the first page, so if they can arrange to have at least three of those four to be positive, then they're likely to make another sale. So they write them themselves, and post a few at a time, under various names, and shortly, the real reviews are pushed down the list. This is also easy to check since there are four or so reviews, all supposedly be different people, that are exact, word for word copies!

An easy solution to this problem would be to just prevent/remove the reviews that fall into this pattern (rather than delete all the reviews, as was done in the past for this) - reviews from people not using the Real Name system and that have not reviewed anything else. Unfortunately, this does smack of censorship.

Or, a review can be kept out of the public eye until that reviewer has written other reviews (of more substance than merely saying it's a great movie), which would indicate that this person is an honest reviewer.  After all, these reviews have to be approved by someone, somewhere, before they actually appear.

Another option is to give customers an option on the website to filter out these types of reviews, and make that the default. A review by someone that's done other reviews is going to carry a bit more weight than one by someone that has never reviewed anything else and only gives a couple lines of text to the effect, ""It rocks.""

This filter can be added to a tool that's already in place, but found only on the second and later review pages - the drop-down list, where we're curently able to sort reviews by Newest First, Oldest First, Highest Rated, Lowest Rated, most & least helpful and by star rating.

Obviously, I'm extremely offended by being tricked into paying money for this thing. I have a right to be. I was lied to by the pages on Amazon. I haven't seen anything else on DVD, or any other medium (that I can remember) that was done so poorly, and I've seen some really bad stuff (Caress of the Vampire 2 and Troll 2 for example). There is no excuse for the horrible frame dropping effect that's all through this thing, or the lamest CG effects I've ever seen in a movie, or the poor acting which falls short of that of a play put on by grade school children. In my view, something this bad can only be made as part of an intentional scam to rip people off (Matrix quality effects?!?!), and these fake reviews only support this opinion. After all, the people behind this mess are obviously aware that what they made is something that anyone older than a two-year old with senses would be ashamed to sell to anyone, yet they're constantly trying to hide the truth from the public to suck more money out of them.

Or, Amazon could just refer people to the reviews on the internet movie database, which seems to be a little more strict about the content of the reviews.  Read those, and you'll see a big swing in the general consensus on this thing.

I am so tempted to report this thing to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, but so far, the only unsafe thing about this DVD is the small possibility of being hit by one when someone throws it away in disgust and anger. Or the possibility of my heart stopping out of sheer boredom if I were to ever be able to sit through all three hours of this turd non-stop.

This thing is bad. Very bad. I was shocked to see that they mentioned in their trailer that it was coming to theaters in 2005! I guess that was the plan up until someone actually saw it. Timbo or someone must have figured out that if this was put into a theater, people would walk out in droves, demanding their mony back, and the movie would have been pulled very quickly, and most likely in a very public way.  This was probably the smartest move these idiots have made, but I suspect it wasn't due to intelligence, but rather because it was too expensive.

It takes a real ass to spam a review system to try to trick more people into buying this thing, and a turd this big could only have been passed by a rather huge one.

But not to dwell on Mr. Piana's body...Sigh...The movie is great. The love scenes between Piana and the wife  work well as they seem to have a strong chemistry.

Getting through it I mean!

The film follows the book very closely in detail & unfortunately for itself in style too! It's ace card being set in the authentic Victorian  time is also the film's weakest point. With the young mordern viewer being unable to relate to a victorian gentleman running from one scene to the next (There is a lot of this, as if we didn't 'get' that the character has just left the scene...the director shows us how he gets to the next scene, again & again & again). The effects are bold but unconvincing, even laughable in places. The acting is inconsistant, swinging from good to amatuer!

Even without an alternative out there, this is a poor film. Think of it as a sort of 3 hour college production, by someone who has not listened during the lessons about pacing or editing.

2312024,5,B0009PW4D2,"Ed Wood would not have made a better movie. Sometimes, it is a comedy, a strange mix of gore and dramatic and funny scenes. When the army shoot on the martians, we see the actors looking from left to right, following the bullets as if they were in a ping-pong party. There is a scene of 3 minutes showing the actors drinking tea, with no words, no action playing in the middle of the war. But sometimes, in the action scenes, the tripod use frequently to put the feets on human beings, especially Women. We hear ""aaah"", then a big ""sprotch"", and we see a big lake of blood. It's shoking because the rest of the movie is quite.

The most astonishing scene is when the burst human are burned by martian heat rays, the are cleaned of flesh, skin, brain, reduced as skeletons, but the skeletons continue to play the comedy, they shake the arms, try to protect themself with their bones , scream during one minute, they seem to say ""i have no brain anymore, it hurts!"". Maybe they wanted to see their own funerals.

The skeletons are the best actors in this film, they continue to play beyond their death, the others can't get it  alive.

It is set in the proper period and follows the actual characters from the book. Point by point, it is well done.

2312031,5,B0009PW4D2,"I tried to read THE WAR OF THE WORLDS when I was 12 years old. I didn't understand most of what I read, but I remembered the giant walking tripods. Also the aliens with whip-like tentacles. In my teen years I had to read the book again for school and this time understood what was happening. From then on, I was hooked on H. G. Wells. I read THE TIME MACHINE, THE INVISIBLE MAN and THINGS TO COME back to back. I've read many of Wells various writings since then. All of his Science Fictions and most of his non-fiction discussion books.

I saw the fifties movie several years ago and I remember that it was different from the book. The obvious big difference was the walking machines missing. With all the new versions of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS coming out, I rewatched the fifties movie and was kind of shocked how dated it was. The woman in particular, was a screaming whipmering ten year old girl in a woman's body. The ""scientist"" seemed to have a degree in anything science related.

I saw the Spielberg/Cruise version of WAR OF THE WORLDS a couple of weeks ago and thought it was okay. Rushed in places and got a few unintended laughs from the audience I was with. I won't see the Asylum version as their press says the only have elements in common with WAR OF THE WORLDS. Also they weren't even called WAR OF THE WORLDS until SPielberg's movie was made known. They were called INVASION. Like the ABC TV series coming up this fall, which strangely has aliens coming in with a storm, like the Spielberg movie, (Which is not in the Wells book).

So now we come to this version of the Wells book, titled H.G. WELLS' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS.

I avoided this version for a while, even though I had originally been excited about it becuase of some of the comments I read in chat groups. I didn't want my memories of the story ruined like what Tim Burten did with THE PLANET OF THE APES. I knew I would eventually see it. At last I broke down and bought a copy.

My first impressions were good. The music started off with a classical buildup and the story led right into actual archival footage of Victorian England. As the movie unfolded, scene by scene, it matched the book. It was so much a direct telling of the book, that I was blown away.

The movie has a low-budget Masterpiece Theater feel to it but this fits. The story is told from the point of view of the Victorians and the movie doesn't miss a note in capturing the feel of the times. The relationships of the people in the story work very well together. I was immediately a fan of this movie and watched it through in one sitting.

The action and special effects have a made for TV quality. But the giant walking tripods are great. They move around much more than they do in the Spielberg movie and you can feel the aliens inside driving them around.

The collapsed house scenes were outright scary and the struggles between the main character and the curate are well staged.

But the most important thing is that Wells' ideas are not lost. His story was to show us how not paying attention to things around us and arrogance are the destruction of civilization. The movie captures these points and illustrates them nicely. The movie doesn't judge the material or have a need to read into Wells' text. It just tells the story. The subtext is from Wells and the book, not from a screenwriter. This is my favorite version of the three that I have seen. Having watched H. G. WELLS THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, I am now a fan.",1123632000,,3475,4.358578052550232
2312032,3,B0009PW4D2,"How do you compare a High Tech big budget film to a much smaller budget film set a hundred years earlier?. Answer: you don't.

Speilbergs multimillion dollar epic has the effects and the stars (and a version of the story) while Hines film sticks to the orignal Victorian story in great detail (at three hours long - almost too much detail), it may lack such stunning effects, but was done with a love of the story and as much accuracy as possible. If Mr Speilberg had not blocked the production of another War of the Worlds movie set in this time, that is what Hines would have done and everyone I know think it is very childish of Speilberg to have banned all publicity and Cinema realease for this film, just because it may have detracted from his own (which not everyone thought was perfect anyway).

O.K. if Tim Hines had tens of millions to throw around it could have been a bit better but for a low budget production it is still worth watching, but it is worth considering that not so many years ago we would have accepted this film a lot less critically than we would now having been spoiled by todays CGI effects. Both films are significanly different to the 1953 edition (which to me, still looks good - if not the best), although when Jeff Waynes 2008 version of the Animated musical comes out perhaps his film will over take the other three - I for one would not be supprised.

I was delighted to find that this had been made as close to the book as possible.  What makes this a fantastic show is that the filming is done in an old classic style.  It is easy to say that the special effects are cheep because it was made to look that way.  Black and white frames hand colored, tinted frames, night sky backdrop painted.  There are even some sceens that are a mixure of black and white and tinted.  Why? To give the feeling that you are actually back at that time period, late 1800's.  The special effects are NOT cheep, but stylized as it would have been done at the turn of the century.  It is almost like watching a silent film with dialogue.  It is extremely creative and artistic.  My 11 year old son is now reading the book and says that the DVD follows the book pretty close.  In fact the DVD follows the description of the tripods and the martians according to the book.  If you want to see what HG Wells had in mind, watch this.  My wife is a librarian for fiction and stated that there had been very little interest in the book since the ""movie"" came out.  But when my sons, 11 and 15 saw this DVD, my oldest son insisted on getting the book for himself.  I think that any production that motivates a teenager to read has merit!

2312043,2,B0009PW4D2,"I've been a big fan of H.G.Wells since childhood, so I was really excited when I heard that someone was finally doing a period version of ""War of the Worlds."" Unfortunately, the film doesn't do real justice to Wells' vision. Some specifics:

Tim Hines was the script writer, the photographer, the editor, and the director. This lack of any external, objective opinion may explain why the film is sooooooo long. A good editor could have trimmed the film's 180 minutes to something more manageable without losing any of the story. Near the beginning, there seem to be endlessly-repeated (identical) sequences of Anthony Piana walking back and forth along the same path through the forest. And just why did Hines feel it necessary to treat us all to an excerpt from G&S's ""Mikado"" in the middle of a Martian attack?

The acting was marginal. The main character's ""British"" accent was really forced and unnatural. (It sounded like Keanu Reeves' sad attempt at British english in Copola's ""Dracula"".) Coupled with his pasted-on, fake-looking moustache, it was difficult to take him seriously.

The film contains a lot of technical flaws. There were a number of scenes supposedly taking place at night, but which were clearly filmed in broad daylight. In a single scene, sometimes Hines would remember to use the day-for-night filter; other times not.

The Martian machines were only vaguely similar to Wells' description; the Hines version looked more like giant, malevolent Sony Aibo mechanical dogs. It was also obvious that Hines used exactly the same CGI footage every time the Martian machines appeared. One of the machines makes a sudden, jerky glide from frame-right to frame-left, and sure enough it does it in every scene.

Most annoying of all was the constant jumpiness of the video. Contrary to what another reviewer stated, I don't believe this is an intentional artistic choice on Hines' part. (Although that may be the spin the movie company is putting on things after the fact.) Rather, it seems to be an artifact of trying to compress three hours of video onto a single-sided DVD. The effect is like watching an internet-TV broadcast over a very slow network connection -- the frame rate just doesn't keep up. Once again, a little editting would have helped this movie's compression problems.

On the positive side, I paid less than a sawbuck for this DVD at my local discount store, so I dont' feel particularly cheated. If you're a fan of H.G., and you've got ten bucks and three hours you don't mind throwing away, you might have some fun with this.",1123459200,6,2564,4.923611111111111

The movie is boring.  I couldn't watch it straight through without doing something else.  While the movie was running on DVD I turned to Amazon and did a review of The Godfather, which is of course a far superior film to this silliness.

On the level of performance, each of the actors deliver authentic characterisations. Anthony Piana's narrator character has an internal calm which works well amid the story's chaos. Each character becomes important when the story seems to require them, and it moves back and forth at will between the narrator and the brother. James Lathrop is particularly peculiar as a shell-shocked artilleryman whose regiment have all been wiped out. John Kaufmann is given the most sustained development as a shocked-into-madness minister driven by his own personal and spiritual demons to ultimately bring on the end of his own life. The narrator's relationship with Susan Goforth as the supporting wife character is a supremely genuine dramatic component of the film, and provides the story with the narrator's mission. It is really only one in a series of confrontations faced by the narrator, but it's given an effective exposition.

For many, the low budget weakness will scuttle their enjoyment of the film, but for those willing to abandon their traditional fondness for million-dollar effects in favour of a well told thought-provoking study of the survival of humanity -- it should prove a rewarding experience.",1123200000,,1424,5.29646017699115

It is very moving, and an example of commitment, faith and absolute love.

Many are saying this is a film that drags on to long and doesn't get to the point. If it didn't get the point soon enough the film would be a drag and would never end. Seeing how it ended, it apparently got to the point. Many say they had to sit through three hours of movie, as if they somehow don't control their own TV remote. How ludicrous. In my fifty-six years of life on this planet I have never watched a movie I did not want to see. I bought the movie ""White Chicks"" and absolutely hated it. Did I watch the whole thing? No. I turned it off after fifteen minutes and never thought about it again until now. I did not MAKE myself watch the rest of the movie and then devote all my spare time to trashing it on the internet. How ludicrous.

I bought this film to watch a mini epic film that has integrity for the original novel. I didn't expect it to cure my life or fix my problems. I expected to be entertained and have fun. That's just what I did. I couldn't take my eyes off this film. I didn't even stop it for a bathroom break. I have watched the film twice from start to finish and enjoyed it more the second time.

I thought the Brother plot was well done. While the Writer plot was long sometimes,the acting and directing in the movie was great at moments, but mostly very good. I did think the editing could have been better, but mostly everyone was incredible in this movie.

Personally, due to the Writer searching to find his love mixed with the bizarre Martian visuals, I do think this is a movie I would watch cuddled on the couch with a new date.

Yes he is.

Now and then one comes across a movie so badly put together that one comes away astonished that those who made it even bothered.  This is one of them.

It is possible to make a movie like this on a shoestring budget.  But it is not possible to fall back on really terrible acting and special effects so corny they make cartoons look realistic.  Even the main character's mustache looks fake!  It sits differently in different scenes.

The woman who plays his wife couldn't act to save her life; the maid was in danger of her eyebrows staying permanently raised; the soldier separated from his unit was so unbelievable that I wanted to send him back to Horsell Common to achieve skeletonhood with the rest of them.  Even the extras were terrible!  They gaze up at the sky, where cgi effects so poor they are laughable supposedly represent the oncoming Martian war machines, and half the crowd doesn't even look scared.  They suddenly start running, obviously cued to do so, some half-smiling, others trying not to laugh as they pretend to be frightened.

This film is a catastrophe.  You don't have to have a Spielberg budget to make a decent film.  People do it all the time with hand-held video cameras.  There is simply no defensible reason to produce a picture this sloppy.  The bad editing mentioned by previous reviewers gives the impression that nobody really gave a damn if the sky looks one way from one camera angle--bright--and dark and rainy from another.  Did the film even have an editor?  I can't be bothered to find out.  H. G. Wells would have thanked the makers for the impulse toward fidelity, and then gone home and vomited.

I would like to believe that Timothy Hines actually wanted to make an antithesis of the Spielberg movie and show that high tec, digitaled special effects, music, good looking talent, acting ability and a zillion $ budget are no longer requirements for today's entertainment industry, nor necesarily appreciated by its target audiences.- A return to nature, to the basic and the naive is what will increase popcorn and nachos sales.

This TWOTW is,in my judgement,the very first ""VIDEO-BOOK"" - remember ""audio books"" originally on cassettes and now on DVD. Watch the DVD and if you can't follow what's supposed to be happening just turn the page of the book and keep on looking at and following the words. Within the 180 mins. you might realize that you possess a faculty that you didn't know existed! - They used to say.. ""use your imagination""!

Me and the missus got the DVD days after seeing Spielberg version. She liked it, but has no interest in seeing it again.

For her, the great punch line was delivered from the mississippi paddle steamer, escaping down the Thames to the English Channel and beyond.... 'Given the chance( or choice ?)we better face the French than the Martians' !

My favourites are any scenes in which the big-busted domestic maid appears, and doesn't open her mouth- she is worth fantasizing over,- martian threat or not.

We also projected that the Cheney/Bush/Blair gang would have found a way to 'get' the Martians before they take-out BIG BEN and succumb to British bacteria.

The DVD,including postage to Mexico City was much less than Popcorn,Nachos and a drink, and 2 tickets  at our local Cinemex, for 120 mins of total inactivity of imagination. And I still think it was worth it.

WELLS' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, which is truly poetic. This is a narrative meditation on life, love, faith and war in which the story of human conflicts unfolds. It deals with the adventures of several individuals, centrally told from the main ""Writer""s perspective, with extended journeying sequences in which Writer Anthony Piana contemplates his relationship with his wife and the world and the people in it and speculates on the futility of panic. Though the battle and fight scenes are obvious in excitement and style, the movie is hypnotically shot and edited and immediately disarms our expectations, taking us into a poetic frame of mind rather than a literal one. This is low budget indie movie making at its best.

It takes some time before the Martians appear, and in this time the film structurally engages a truthful and deep victorian society so by the time the Martians engage their massive fighting machines leading to a climactic battle you are successfully transported back to the turn of the century and living as a gentleman (or lady, as it may be).

The film concentrates on mood and tone, crafting a world which alternates between great realism and surrealism, and earthly and alien, and in which the overwhelming force of the Martians is seen as an unholy seige to the natural order of life on this planet. The film does its best to suggest great hope and catharsis, and that we, after thousands of years of evolution, have earned our perserverance and ability to survive against all odds.",1123027200,,1641,4.857142857142857

The first hour of the film involves so many scenes of the narrator just quietly walking from one place to the other I almost lost interest and gave up on it right then and there. Hey, director, ever hear of a lapse disolve? Or a montage?

Many scenes go on way too long, and would have benefited from trimming either at their beginning, their ending, or both. At three hours, the whole thing could have used a lot of tightening up. A two hour version would have been excellent, and nothing would have been lost in the telling of the story.

Having said all that, anyone viewing it can tell it was a labor of love, and perhaps that was the problem.  Someone should have stepped back and looked at it with a critic eye and the audience in mind and broke out the scissors.

It is almost worth watching for this reason alone. It has the worst actors,the worst dialogue, the worst editing,the worst producing, the worst script and the worst special effects of any film ever made.

The actors use the worst accents i have ever heard ,straight from Mary Poppins. In one sentence one actor manages to go from a geordie to a Irish, then to a Scotish and then finally settling back to an ""olde"" english accent. Truely poor.

The film was so obviously filmed in America, even though the storey is based in England. The Train station is my favorite.

One actor plays 2 characters, how does the directer think he can carry this off??? Easy, put on an obvious false mustache.

This title is very long at 3 hours and really does drag on in some sections. However the quality of the Old style worlde it provides is excellent and it is the closest screenplay I've seen to a book. The only reason I have to be negative about this film is that the special effects ruin it. They went for the ""Sky Captain : World of Tomorrow look"" and failed . If this film could be redone with the even the George Pal SFX then it would be a classic.

I would only advise you to get this if you can look past the SFX and see the gem in the dirt.",1122940800,5,847,3.834285714285714

2312089,5,B0009PW4D2,"Timothy Hines directed this film about the conflict between Earth and Mars. It's without even having to think about it that I feel H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds will likely be instantly stood up against Steven Spielberg's version, when, in fact, the two films, in my humble opinion, couldn't be farther apart. Spielberg's version has Tom Cruise, the hero movie star, saving his daughter from aliens (not Martians specifically) and saving everyone around him. Cruise even has to point out to the trained soldiers that the alien ""shields"" are down. He's the guy with all the answers. In this film, the characters are EXACTLY from the novel War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells. They are so accurate its uncanny. The people are Victorians. The enemy is the Martians who are first mistaken as innocent creatures fallen to Earth. The Martians are worth adversaries who care not an iota about the humans. We are their feed and nothing more. It's creepy good. The film takes place in the year 1900 (not present like Spielberg) so they really are two very different films. In my humble opinion I enjoyed the special effects in Spielberg's version much more (especially the beginning of his film), but this version is the one I'm always thinking about and have watched three times.

I had read the reviews and heard the warnings, and I thought I was prepared for anything - at best I thought, a faithful (if misguided) attempt at an original adaptation; at worst, a so-good-it's-bad ""Plan 9"" for the new millennium. So when I managed to pick up a copy in Walmart while in Florida and brought it back to the UK, I joked to my friends ""Prepare for the worst movie ever made!""

Oh, cruel Karma.

There is absolutely NOTHING to recommend this film. The ""special"" effects look like the work of a first year design student using a Spectrum ZX81. The acting is terrible, the accents are WORSE than terrible (one artillery mans' accent seems to take us on a tour of the British Isles, from Scotland to Wales via Northern Ireland), the dialogue is stilted, the editing is non-existent, the production values prove that no expense has been gone to. Words really cannot describe how bad this movie is; from the Union Flag flying from the horribly CGI'd Thunderchild (the Royal Navy flies the White Ensign, NOT the Union flag) to the woodworm ridden acting, this is quite simply a crime against film making.

When you consider some of the literally-zero-budget fan films that are available on the 'net (the Star Wars short ""Troops"" for example), the whole ""we're enthusiastic amateurs"" argument goes right out of the window. And if you believe an interview with Hines on the Pendragon website, this film had an 8 figure budget! I can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the US. Maybe the problem is that Hines & co didn't seem to bother with a screenplay, and just lifted the text straight out of the book. Characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words. Just about the ONLY person who even comes close to giving a decent performance is Darlene Sellers, the ex-soft porn actress.

Now I know there are people out there who probably did like this film, but a lot of the positive reviews on this board seem HIGHLY suspect to me, especially the ones that talk about the ""Epic, state-of-the-art special effects"" and the ""Oscar-winning acting"". It's not my place to point fingers, but in my opinion I would be very wary of the reviews that paint this film as some kind of cinematic Tour de Force.

My advice? Pray like crazy that Jeff Wayne's 2007 animated movie doesn't get screwed up, and go watch the Spielberg version. It may not be true to the text of the book, but I can say this; As a lifelong HG Wells fan (and Englishman as well) Speilbergs film IS true to the Spirit of the book. Maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country, but I will say this: Timothy Hines stole three hours of my life, and I want them back.",1122854400,29,2828,4.526418786692759

2312101,2,B0009PW4D2,"I must say after viewing Timothy Hine's War of the Worlds that I am very disappointed. While the film is undoubtedly a labor of love, it looks like a labor of love done on a circa 1998 Macintosh in someones basement. I was frankly expecting a much more big-budget look to this film based on some of the hype prior to its release. Instead, we are treated to very cheesy and often gratuitous special effects that often seem to bear no relation to reality, and actually pale to special effects done in films of the 50's. The level of realism is computer-gamish at best, with fires that have no smoke and don't seem to burn anything, people burned to skeletons that writhe about after they are dead, (not to mention have a sheen to them), and cannons that emit no smoke when fired, and are also missing the teams of horses that would pull them. Indeed the historical and continuity errors in this film could fill a fair sized book, I expect...its obvious that technical advice was sorely lacking. While I was expecting something of a stylized look to the film, it is so inconsistent as to be downright confusing at times. The strange filtering and tinting in some scenes seems to be an intentional artifice, but the atrocious color-matching in other scenes seems to completely obviate the effort. While the Martians and their machines have an interesting look, the quality of the animation is jerky and poor, once again much like a circa-1998 computer game. England in 1898 seems strangly empty, with featureless CG streets and buildings, groups of houses that seem to be adjacent to wilderness areas, and battleships with no crew. The sequence where the Thunder Child warship battles the martians is terribly bungled, the animated ships are comical, traveling without wakes at impossible velocities, firing guns with no one manning them...all in all, quite embarrassing. Much of the footage of the actors is confined to them reacting to off-camera action while placed against a CG background...even some of the interiors seem to be matted in...is it really so hard to film simple interiors? As I think someone else here pointed out, many of the scenes with CG effects end up looking like outtakes or mockups for the real shot...but they are the real shot...The night scenes all seem to be shot during the day with a blue filter...I thought this went out with low budget films in the 60's? And you may need to get the motion sickness pills out during any scene where the camera pans...it pans in steps so jerky my girlfriend was getting dizzy watching it...Then there is the terrible editing...we are treated to about an hour of extraneous footage of people running through grasslands, down empty roads, and through the same groups of trees for no clear reason, except to impress upon us in a very heavy handed way that this was before the age of the car and if you wanted to get somewhere you had to walk (or run, judging by the amount of jogging around in this film, apparently everyone in Victorian England was a marathon class runner, even women in long dresses and high heeled boots). Indeed the film gets off to a very slow start indeed, with a huge amount of time devoted to Ogilvie climbing in and out of the Martian cylinder's pit over and over again...what is the purpose of this? There are serious issues with the sound mix as well, I found it difficult to understand much of the dialogue, as it is mixed so low in comparison to the music...during the narrated parts I was looking for subtitles, but found none. Admittedly, the film adheres quite closely to the book, and takes most of its dialogue verbatim, but the internal conversations that happen within a written story don't always make for compelling on-screen speech, and the turn-of-the-century prose sounds rather stilted at times. While most of the actors are at least competent, its pretty obvious that some of them are <ahem> friends or relatives of someone. I suppose I should stop criticizing this film, I know the guy put alot of effort into it, but it's obvious he bit off much more than he could chew. <sigh>",1122768000,13,4083,4.719887955182073

In 2003, a Sony Pictures publicist falsified reviews for `A Knight's Tale.' This cost the studio $1.5m.

A report of the case, 29th January 2004: `An appeals court has knocked down Sony Films' efforts to block a class-action suit over the company's advertisements for A Knight's Tale which contained comments praising the film from a bogus reviewer. (The reviewer, ""David Manning,"" who described the film's leading man, Heath Ledger, as ""this year's hottest new star,"" was exposed as the invention of a Sony marketing executive, assigned to put a positive spin on poorly reviewed films.) Sony had sought to block the suit on grounds of protected speech, but Judge Robert Mallano wrote in his majority decision that if Sony's position were upheld, ""all sorts of mischief"" might ensue. ""For example,"" he said, ""a film could be advertised as having garnered 'Three Golden Globe Nominations' when it had received none.""'

Here's a report of the verdict on 3rd September 2004: `Sony Pictures has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle a class action suit charging that the company conned them into seeing movies by planting fake reviews in their advertisements, Reuters reported today (Friday), citing an unnamed source. The suit was originally filed in June 2001 after Newsweek magazine exposed the fact that a review cited in one of the ads for Sony's movie `A Knight's Tale' (released in May of 2001) was actually written by a Sony publicist who concocted the name David Manning.'

If it happened to Sony, it can happen to you. Stop posting fake reviews and leave this site to genuine customers and their opinions, good or bad. Some real people do like the film, but your fake reviews make even them suspect. You are doing yourself no good by your actions.

I have long wanted to see an accurate period production of the film. While the fact that I did not recognize any of the names in the cast or the production nor did I recognize the company releasing the film did give me pause, I was curious to see what the film-makers accomplished.

As a DOCTOR WHO fan and as someone who has performed in community theater, I can overlook a certain degree of effects shots that don't come off as planned as well as make allowances for some acting that isn't quite up to snuff.

I initially thought that the approach to color was an interesting experiment, as was the jerkiness to the movement. I was willing to give the production team the benefit of the doubt. . . until the first martian was revealed in all it's so-called glory. The matting of the martian onto the location footage was so incompetently done, I had flashbacks to the lobster-creature in ""Teenagers from Outer Space"", and I was reduced to helpless mirth.

I then realized that either the director or the editor was padding out the sequence by reusing the same reaction shots from the townspeople to no good effect.

Then came the heat-ray. As a child, I saw footage of Buddhist monks immolating themselves to protest the Vietnam War. Irwin Allen did a better job convincingly simulating a burning person in ""Fire"" (accomplished by setting a stuntman in an asbestos suit aflame) than Hines accomplished by having his effects people superimpose digital flame over his actors, then morphing them into magically thrashing CGI-skeletons.

As the film continued, my jaw hung open and my eyes bugged out in disbelief at what I was seeing onscreen. The sheer cinematic incompetence on display was continually bringing me out of the world Hines was trying to create and into which he was trying to draw me.

I am one of the few people of my generation who made it through my high school, college and adult years without ever ingesting an illegal drug (and I am also a Mystery Science Theater fan, to boot). Drugs might have helped deaden the DEEEEEEP HURTING this movie caused me.

When it was over, after three interminable hours, and having seen each individual horse billed by name in the closing credits, I sat staring at my television screen utterly unable to believe that someone would in this day and age have the audacity to release a film/video/DVD in such a shambolic state.

Even now, I am flabbergasted and unable to adequately describe to others what I saw and experienced should I be tempted to warn them away from viewing this DVD.

This is a terrible, terrible, terrible movie-- made more horrible by the grandeur of the original source material and the lofty aspirations the film-makers initially claimed to have for it.",1122595200,12,2935,4.703703703703703

I was so eager to see this movie and to like it but I'm sorry to say that this is by far one of the worse movies ever made.  This version of War of the Worlds gives new meaning to the term ""B"" movie.

The special effects in this movie are so sub-par as to be called laughable.  A large part of this movie is shot in front of a green screens with poorly executed CGI backgrounds.  None of the effects are ""live""...even the most simple effect is bad CGI.  The movie is also horribly edited with choppy scene changes.  The director must have hired family and friends to act in this movie because the acting is terrible and amateurish at best.  There is very little that is good about this movie.

I will say that the music is very good and fitting and the design of the alien ships is also very good but at 3 hours long NOTHING could save this movie.  Save your money and avoid this disaster movie...or should I say ""A disaster of a movie""?",1122595200,11,1056,4.132352941176471
2312117,2,B0009PW4D2,"When I first heard about this film I would visit Pendragon's web site every day in anticipation of the movies release.  I was disapointed when the release date was put back, but encouraged when I discovered the delay was in order to improve the special effects.  Pendragon was promoting an epic to rival the production of the Lord of the Rings.

When the movie was released I had to import a copy from the USA as it's not available in the UK.

The movie follows the book very close, but those extra special effects are the worst I've ever seen.  They are not just low budget they have been produced with the least effort.  Dr Who in the 70's at least attempted to make what you saw believable!

The begining of the movie is very detailed and the end of it is thrown together.  As the movie goes on the effects get worse.  Please read some of the other reviews.  I'm afraid the bad ones tell it like it is!",1122595200,11,905,4.270588235294118

It was a blast. The ""curate"" fellow is absolutely hysterical. The ""narrator"" was a fine fellow. VERY H. G. Wells. It tickled me silly to hear the actual dialogue from the book performed. Just ate it up.

2312121,4,B0009PW4D2,"Hi. I work in the movie effects industry and have worked on a few large scale major motion picture productions. I have followed Pendragon and Timothy Hines for years as he tried to mount this picture. Years before Spielberg started his picture, I might add.

I want to say that there is somebody gunning for him on this and other sites. He busted his ass without much money and made his movie. His special effects aren't the cutting edge. A few are poor. But most of the effects shots aren't bad and sell the moment. Some of the shots are state of the art. By my calculations the effect in this movie would total thousands of hours of render time. I've seen much worse from some mainstream pictures. The martian fighting machines appear many more times than in the Spielberg film and only ""float"" in one shot. The Spielberg fighting machines never take more than a step or two. the fighting machines in Hines'es version walk all over the place and display a true malevolent character.

The acting in the movie is better than most TV movies on any given day. I was taken in with characters and story to the end. Anthony Piana does a bang up job playing both the main character and his brother. And unlike Tom Cruise in the Spielberg version, he doesn't save the day by crawling up into a fighting machine with an opening that looks disturbingly like a certain human orifice to plant grenades! All there original characters are there from the book,as conceived by H. G. Wells.

Hines made his picture. It is a strong effort and worth the look see. By the way. The pictures on the box art are all from the movie! What's up with the lying to hurt this guy? He did a good job. More than most I've known who are always going to make their big picture but it never appears. Hines did it. See the picture.",1122508800,,1797,4.422960725075528

2312126,5,B0009PW4D2,"I was out with the girls at Wal-Mart buying lentils when Adrienne saw this movie and said we should all watch this tonight. I was nervous about doing so as my husband is in the armed forces, I tend to avoid anything that has the word 'War' in the title.

Well, I need not of worried! The beautiful poetry of this three hour masterpiece washed over my soul with its palete of strange colours and brought me and most of the other girls to a place of peace, most of us cried as the movie made us confront our feelings of loss, fear and worry that we pathetic humans could be wiped from our beautiful earth like so many ants by those unfeeling blobby things from space!

The acting was amazing, I have never seen human beings behave like this, it really captured the authentic feeling of the age (I had ancestors alive then, so believe me, I know what those times were like), this film would easily win an oscar had it been released in theatres!

We sqeauled like school girls when the boat valiantly fought against the space walkers in the water, what amazing special effects!

By the films end, it didn't feel like three hours at all, infact, we all decided to watch the movie again, right there and then!

If you like films along the lines of Independence Day and Star Wars then your soul won't open like a beautiful orchid to the dappled sunlight of this movie.

I pray for you, I really do.

Now I can't wait to read the original book by Orson Welles!

2312127,4,B0009PW4D2,"This is the real story of War of the Worlds as it was originally written. Nobody saves the day ala Cruise style. No jet planes shoot down the aliens. Instead you see a truthful telling of everyday persons dealing with the tragedy, excitement and confusion of war facing overwhelming forces; in this case Martians. It is a thrill ride, and you will not be disappointed if you go into it knowing that this movie was made by a little movie company outside of hollywood on passion and brains rather than millions of dollars.

Anthony Piana is the Writer. The Writer is a journalist of some kind. When a famous astronomer discovers that a meteor has crashed to Earth with persons inside, he calls on the Writer to assist in controlling the exiciting provincial townspeople. Very soon the meteor reveals Martians inside who spectacularly innahilate all around the meteor. The Writer is there when this happens and is the lucky one to escape.

Despite the deaths at the meteor the townspeople are relatively unimpressed with the Martians' fire power and regard them as beasts who can't get out of the whole the meteor dug. When the Martians fire power reaches the Writer's house he quickly drives his wife off to a relatives house for safe keeping. He borrows a cart to do so and, when returning it, discovers the Martians aren't slug creatures but intelligent, with massive giant armor walking war machines that stride over him as we stride over ants. This is one of the most excited sequences in the movie.

He stumbles home in shock when a soldier comes in his yard. His neighborhood is deserted and he confronts the soldier--known as the Artilleryman-- with fear. While the Writer drove his wife away from the Martians the Artilleryman was at the meteor site fighting the Martians. He tells the battle to the Writer which becomes a flashback not of a war but of the complete destruction of the humans under the feet of the Martians. This whole war battle is another great sequence in the movie.

The two set off together away from the Martians and towards the Writer's wife and other military camps for the Artilleryman to join. The two get separated in a spectacular invasion of a small city by the big Martians in their walking machines. The Writer manages to escape again only by the grace of God.

He then meets up with the Curate, a minister type person so caught up in the rules of society he can't comprehend the Martians and their destruction. He's positively mad from the experience and his craziness excelerates as he and the Writer survive together right under the feet of the Martians. The horror of the invaders grows and grows and you don't feel safe anywhere. The Curate and Writer spend many days together trapped in the demolished wreckage of a house where they fight with each other to stay alive and not go completely insane. The results are stunning. I won't give away the ending, but it is very moving and a bit shocking.

Throughout this story is also the story of the Writer's brother, also played by Anthony Piana. This is totally shocking as I watched the whole movie and had no idea that the same actor played both roles. The Writer's brother is a college student in London and has the most spectacular fight scene protecting two high society ladies. He fights off three thieves on a dirt road. It is an ugly street fight that's very well done.

I enjoyed this movie very much. The story stucture was spectacular and the lines of the movie very memorable. The natural humor was great-- it can't be tragic all the time-- and it all made sense. I recommend this movie very highly.",1122422400,6,3601,4.661417322834645

2312130,1,B0009PW4D2,"So I received this War of the Worlds film today from the USA, and boy is it ever evident why it never got a theatrical release. Even my worst expectation wasn't 1/10th as bad as it turned out.

I've only watched an hour ( out of 3!!) but it's the biggest pile of garbage I've ever laid eyes on. The acting is like a period piece porno without the sex.

The digital sets don't quite *sarcasm* match Sky Captain ( a film with a much lower budget than this drivel if reports are to be believed ). I mean could they not find a bush with trees behind, instead of resorting to XBox videogame scenery and special effects? And the buildings!!!! More polygons in a Quake level.

It's all treated with this kind of sepia tone, and a kind of jerky hand cranked camera effect, but that's more to do with covering up the shoddy effects and cheap budget.

The editing is woeful, with endless scenes of people climbing up and down the hill in ""horse-ellllll common"". Which brings me to the accents.

The accents are particularily risible, and the main character's moustache has a life of it's own. Faithful it may be, but when whole paragraphs of narrative from the book are assigned to the characters as actual dialogue, it just sounds like gibberish, and judging by the delivery, the actors certainly don't know what the hell they are on about.

The heat ray effects are comical in the extreme, especially when even after the victims are reduced to skeletons they still seem the have the brain activity and muscular structure to continue flailing their arms and legs Wile E Coyote style.

The tripods are very very stupid indeed, and move like when you play with action figures sort of bouncing them along with a kind of attempt to make it look like the legs are moving, but add to this the difficulty of the third leg, and it's done in very poor CGI. Oh yes, and the martians themselves look like um, i dunno something from childrens television, only not as professionally done.

The whole thing so far is like one big long animatic, you know, that will have spectacular effects later. I mean, technically the first appearance of the tripods, was pretty much as described in the book, but the execution is just amatuerish in the extreme. I read, in an interview, the director saying they raised $42 million dollars for this, but it doesn't show. I guess he might have pulled a ""Producers""-style scam, because the money isn't on the screen, that's for sure. Or maybe he was lying. I dunno.

I don't know if I'll be able to watch the rest. I feel dirty owning it. I figured ""It's only $10"" but I want my money back, damn you!

I just watched an episode of X-files before hand that probably had 1/20th the budget of this film ( if the director is to be believed ), but oozed class from every frame.

I'm a huge War of the Worlds fan, and had high hopes for this, and was prepared to forgive it as a lower budget independent film, if they were at least creative about it, but frankly they appear to be trying to catch some publicity scraps from the infinitely superior Spielberg adaptation.",1122422400,11,3074,4.481216457960644
2312131,1,B0009PW4D2,"I was so looking forward to the arrival of this DVD, within 20 minutes of the opening credits I was wondering why! This without doubt is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I can only wonder what poor Mr Tim Hines was trying to achieve. The film itself did follow the original book quite well. However, the acting, editing, filming and special effects were terrible. The tripods were amazing, they could actually walk through a forrest without disturbing a single leaf, the Thunder Child scene was pianfully funny, the ship looked like she was made of Lego and the whole scene looked like it was done on a home computer, an old one at that. I am a WOFW fan but this film has not done the orignal book any favours. Perhaps the re-edited version of the film will be better, but I have my doubts!",1122336000,15,798,4.3624161073825505
2312132,1,B0009PW4D2,"Regarding the theory that this film is intended to be artistically modelled as if it were made in the 1920s. There is severe error with that assumption for countless reasons. Here are just a few:

1. Rather than utilizing what would have been a very artistic approach to the alien vehicles (stop-motion animation), the author's of this film chose to use cheap, grade-z computer generated effects. (why, Why, WHY make an ugly, computer generated horse!) There is just no logic behind the majority of this movie's production decisions.

2. The film has blatent historical (and other) errors; such as: the military boats that the human's use are unlike any boat ever made in human history (in addition to the fact that their laughable computer generated styling makes them, quite literally, unlike any boat ever made). Also, when the traveller's are riding across the sea, their environment looks as if it is inside a vacuum (i.e. hair isn't blowing, etc). There is nothing artistic about that--just plain amateur filmmaking.

3. Computer generated fire. Sorry, but they didn't have that in the 1920s. Were the author's seriously attempting to follow the model of that time period they would never have allowed such a thing--especially when it looked THIS bad.

4. What I can only guess are DVD pressing errors. There is absolutely no excuse for these. At least on my copy, at various points throughout the movie you are shown quick snippets of film that has either occured or will occur (at it's intended spot) later in the film. A similar, but less intrusive, attribute of this film, is that the editor reused certain footage at various times to lengthen scenes--why ANYONE would want to lengthen this rediculous movie is beyond me.

I can not and will not ever understand why this movie has gained such a rediculously high ranking on this web site. I could see this film getting a 2/5 for it's novelty and it's attempt to remain true to the source. However, the fact of the matter is that this film completely disgraces it's source and mocks it's audience (perhaps unintentionally). Until I have reason to believe otherwise, I will remain convinced that this movie is the product of a greedy man trying to capitalize off of a popular film and beloved story.

The trailers on the web site looked bad but I though they were pre-production and would be cleaned up and the special effects made, well, better than something from the 'Money For Nothing' video. I should have realised it was going to be bad when it went straight to DVD for $10 (which is about 6!!!!), but I didn't expect it to be this bad. Its 3 hours long and thats 2hr 59mins too long.

I can forgive the special effects to a certain degree, but as for the English accents, oh dear lord I have never heard anything so bad. At one point there is a bloke talking in his god awful Engerlish accent I could not understand a word he said, it was even worse than Dick Van Dyke in Meery Poppins. The main character looks very much like Freddy Mercury and I was just waiting for his fake moustache to fall off. The tripods are very very bad and if anybody has listened to the Jeoff Wayne musical, you will know how disturbing the 'Uuuuulaaaah' sound is. The tripods in the pendragon film make a sort of high pitched squeaking noise, which is hardly a menacing sound for an invading alien race.

At one point there are two women in a horse drawn cart, but for some reason they are using one of those tiny minature horses!!!! It was obviously cheaper than a full size horse.

The only good thing I can say is that it does stay loyal to the book.

In a nutshell, its bad....its very very bad. Watch this film and you'll never be able to say a bad thing about any other film!!!

Being a Brit I was was somewhat dissappointed by the constant resiting of ""War of the Worlds"" in comempory America (no offence intended to our friends in the US - I do understand why the 50's version , Spielberg version and Independence Day were re-sited in America) and I've always felt that the story deserved to be told as H G Well's intended - i.e. Victorian England.  Having obtained a copy and watched it I can only comment that it is an utter waste of the aluminium and plastic that went into the DVD disc itself.  Appalling acting, and really the most shocking English accents since Keanu Reeves in Dracula.  I've seen more convincing special effects on computer games I played 10 years ago on my first pentium PC.  A good half of the film (that's 90 minutes or so) seems to be people walking backwards and forwards through the ""English"" countryside.  On the plus side costume and weaponry seems relatively accurate, the story is very faithful to the book and the CGI tripods are relatively good.  On the minus side the CGI martian is laughable as is the CGI ""rendering"" (in flat colour) of the Thunderchild.

One ""actor"" plays two parts and these are only distinguishable by the fact the main character (the writer) appears to be balancing a hairy slug on his top lip.

If anyone has seen ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" you may get an understanding of just how bad this film is.  At least Ed Wood's effort was made 50 years ago.  I sincerely hope that the perpetrators of this monstrosity were college students creating a media studies project.

I actually want my money back but strongly think that Timothy Hines should deliver it personally since he stole so much time from my life with this drivel.

2312143,1,B0009PW4D2,"There are several versions of H.G.Wells' War of the Worlds. I was surprised that this version ever made it to the shelves.

  From the onset,i thought it may work,but within ten minutes,i realised my mistake. The ""Martians"" (which i thought were the 21st century teletubbies) looked so cute,apart from the tentacles. When they first appeared,i thought they were going to start crying,after smashing their spaceship into a pit,with super imposed little flames,burning on the gravel.

  Then the thrill of the funnel,bringing fourth the heat ray. Looking very similar to a ladies cosmetic mirror,i thought the invaders were going to brake it,after seeing it warp and spin at different angles. Suddenly,POW,the heat ray fires ,or misfires.

  Onlookers are seen dancing in super imposed flames,covering them. Slowly,they collapse to the ground,seemingly in exhaustion until they turn into plastic skeletons. Once at this stage,they start flailing and squirming as though in agony,not realising,they are already dead!

  Combine this with the cast,one by one,being chased by,what seems to be,a psychopath,but we'll use the term ""camera"" as they run around town,down the country lane,up the hill,across the meadow,past the barn,around the pit,past the wall etc,etc,etc...

  It was Ogilvy,the old sprinter with the cane,that started it! Then one by one,the other characters copy him. So a lot of time is spent watching these people go for a run around the town.

2312144,3,B0009PW4D2,"The Nightmare Of Ecstasy is the title for a book about the film director/producer Ed Wood who has been widely berated (and at the same time adored by those who love the under-dog and his passionate dedication to film-making even though the result was bizzarre!) as owning the title of worst film director of all time.

Some people are saying that Timothy Hines can now fit the bill alongside Ed Wood because of this production, and while it certainly has some inferior elements I don't think that such denegrating title is really appropriate at all.

Some of the reviews on here have been way over the top in their derision of this movie and it's makers in my opinion. It has some visual problems (e.g. in the picture compositing in super-imposed scenes and some shockingly bad sfx) and also some loud 'theatre' style acting which detracts from one's enjoyment at times and prohibits the suspension of disbelief.

On the other hand there are some pretty great visual effects and some good acting from one or two of the people involved as well (e.g. Anthonay Piana the lead actor). I got the feeling when watching this movie that it had started out with high hopes but hadn't received the money that it needed in order to make it look as good as it should have. At times one feels that one is watching an amateur fan production (I don't mean that nastily) that is made with passion, but little professionalism.

At other times one is indeed swept up into the story and the delightfully realised visions of Victorian England under alien seige. It is then distracting to have that fascination with the scenario  somewhat destroyed by some inferior acting and/or visual effects.

I'm not sure if this should be forgiven because this is an independant movie or not... Little money obviously does create deficiencies in any production, but this can be overlooked and forgiven when there are redeeming features (like good acting and dialgue etc).

For example Doctor Who the Uk science fiction series ran for 26 years even though it was made on a tight budget and at a crazy pace considering the stories that were being told. But it was none-the-less very much celebrated and enjoyed by millions of people around the world for it's incredible quirkiness and intelligent inventive plots and generally good acting and characterisation.

Although I actually liked this WOTW movie in general it sometimes suffered from visual problems that shouldn't have occured because even with a low budget they could have been overcome... This is surely a sign that this movie is in some ways really quite bad - but I clarify that by saying that it is also fun and exciting at times too.

I found it enjoyable in many places despite it's problems and despite my own preconceptions of what this movie should have been like before it came out. The really bad bits (i.e. visual effects, acting or editing wise) do make this film suffer but it can still be watched with an appreciation of the book that it comes from and the passionate intention of it's makers.

I'm glad that it has been made even if it could be much better:

2312148,4,B0009PW4D2,"Let me say right from the start, I did not work on this film, have no connection to the production company, or any vested interest in this version.  With that said let me say this, if you're a fan of big budgeted Sci-Fi extravaganzas which run just under 2 hours, if you believe that the current series of Battlestar Galatica is better than the original, if you prefer the newest season of Doctor Who to the original series, or like the last few Godzilla films over the films from the 50s and 60s, if your taste is more geared towards Star Trek: The Next Generation than the original series, then you will not like this film!

With that said however, if you're like me, who grew up on the classic Star Trek, who still thinks that the best season of Doctor Who was it's first, and who feel that it is the story, and not the special effects, which are the most important aspect of any film, then this is by far the best filmed version of ""The War of the Worlds"" to date.  Director Timothy Hines has a real knack for allowing the story as H.G. Wells penned it to unfold.  Yes, the film is a bit long at 3 hours, but 95% of this is spent on telling the story and allowing things to unfold in a logical order.  The characters are interesting to watch, and hold true to Wells' version to a degree.  While the CGI effects are not up to par with ILM, they serve the film well, and while the film has been criticized for its poor use of green screen effects, this reviewer and his wife were left with the impression that one was watching a moving version of an oil painting, or an old classic film from the 30s.  While this might not be everyone's cup of tea, these effects certainly added a feel to the film that is lacking in the DreamWorks's version.  In addition this version presents the Martians as real threats, destroying everything in their path, something even the Asylum version does not completely do (a review of the Asylum version will be forth coming).  Of course there are the obvious mistakes, like inter-cutting night and day scenes, but these are minor, and if one can look past the flaws in, say any Sci/Fi film, or suspend ones belief in the existence in alien life, then these little annoyances do not detract from the story.  As for the acting, while none of the players need worry about penning their Academy Awards speech, it not as bad as some have reported.  And besides, with the exception of Dakota Fanning, can anyone say that the acting in the DreamWorks version was any good?

In short, this film does not deserve the criticism that it's been getting, and the production values are not as poor as other reviewers have made them out to be.  Fans who are hooked into the big Sp/Fx films will not like this version, but those of us who enjoy a good story no matter how long (or short) should pick up this version.  At around $11.00 you really can't go wrong.",1121731200,8,2878,4.375234521575985

Stories that the film couldn't be released because of copyright infringements by Pendragon against Paramount. So when this appeared I had to see what all the fuss was about.

Firstly the film is way to long and dragged out. Running just under 3 hours, it could have been more tightly edited to say 2 hours. The story follows HG Wells' novel pretty closely, but some of the acting is terrible. Ogilvy, played by Jack Clay is to say the least laughable.

The tripods look pretty good, but the special FX in general are pretty amateurish. The destruction of Big Ben could have been done better with an old Amiga 1200 computer. The Thunderchild FX was pretty dire, they looked like little plastic boats on a pond.

Timothy Hines stated the budget was $12 million, I honestly can't see where the money went. I really wanted to like this film as it was going to be the first true adaptation set in 19th century England. England in this seems to be mainly fields with little village settlements. In the London scenes, the building architecture is all the wrong period. Most of London was destroyed in 1666, so there is very little left of the Tudor period that Timothy Hines seems to think London was.

Hopefully Jeff Wayne will redress the balance when his cgi animated version comes out possibly 2007. If it's done to the same standard as the album it will be brilliant.",1121731200,8,1487,4.558052434456929
2312162,1,B0009PW4D2,"I really wanted to enjoy this film because it's a faithful adaptation of the novel. I was prepared for it being low budget and not having state of the art effects but I couldn't believe just how bad it is and what a shoestring budget it must have been made on. The CGI work is poor and looks like it was done on a PC by people who don't know how to do film effects. The rendering was bad and lacking in detail, and why they didn't use models in some parts instead is a mystery - in fact CGI seems to have been used for almost everything apart from the actors, the countryside, and a few real building props and backdrops. Okay, the design of the alien machines wasn't bad but the execution of the CGI effects was. What should have been a highlight of the film in the Thunderchild sequence was more like a bad joke. Saying that, the desanguination sequences with the cow and opera singer are even worse.

The editting is nothing short of bizarre in some places. There's a scene with the journalist and his wife supposedly in the woods at night and looking at the stars. The camera then pans to the characters who are in the woods in full daylight! Either use a filter or do a night shoot. Alas, the list of problems doesn't stop there. The acting was poor on the whole, the actors were obviously not English, the locations were obviously America and not England, the use of blue screen was so extensive as to be distracting, and some effects were just plain silly like the writhing skeletons. Need I go on?!

Seriously, the only positive thing about this film is that it's close to the book and set in the right time period. It doesn't engage the watcher and even though it contains dramatic scenes it doesn't convey that sense very well. I have to wonder why if the budget was so small and the effects people were so bad why Timothy Hines actually made the film. He shouldn't have bothered.",1121731200,9,1890,4.3664772727272725

Even if you can find your way through all the boring dialog, overlook the main character's fake mustache (it almost stares back at you!), and annoyances induced by the plethora of false backgrounds, amateur effects & film-school-drop-out editing, you'll still find yourself bothered by the jumpy/jittery playback evident in almost every scene as if the movie were playing back on an underpowered computer with a painfully slow hard drive.",1121644800,11,781,5.198412698412699

But the result is so sloppy and self-indulgent, and the special effects so poorly executed, that all sense of horror and excitement are lost.

Perhaps this film was made by high-school students working in a garage. Clearly they had no real sets or actors. The special effects are a jumble of techniques, with the martian machines (the tripods, the spiders, and the death ray) reasonably well done but most of the rest just horrible. The scenes of destruction of London and other towns make the burning of Tokyo in the original Godzilla movie look good.

True, there are deviations from the Wells novel, but they are minor and only add to the stupidity of the direction.  In a way it's funny.

I liked the novel approach to the aliens and the Heat Ray.  I thought it interesting that, after a person was hit with the Heat Ray, they'd burn for a bit, change into a skeleton (looking like it was stolen from a fun house) and then desolve into dust.

Anyway, I just saw Speilberg's version and just finished the '53 version.

This is what I think...

The 1953 (original) version was MUCH better! Why?

Well, in Spielberg's version was SO generic. The storyline was generic and the movie as a whole felt watered down. The graphics were great and I'm not afraid to admit that. But with all of the great graphics, it still didn't leave me speechless. More like....EH. The '53 version was more interesting because there was ""heart"" in this movie and you could tell. Yeah the graphics weren't great, but so what? They did the movie as best as they could at the time and they hit it off with knockout.

See guys? This is a perfect example where ""graphics"" were not the issue. Hines' version stunk in every way it could stink. Speilberg's version is waaaay too overrated. And after all of that, the original 1953 flick won over all.

I had no idea anyone could make a movie adaptation of H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds entirely in PowerPoint. Second, if the budget was $42,000,000 or $42.00 (I'm guessing the later, not the former), what really matters is: what did the filmmakers do with what they were given? They had one of the most famous and memorable stories ever written, they had some actors, they had some props & costumes, they had some locations, and they had some decent ideas about creating CGI imagery. Reading reviews on this site, and others, it would indicate the answer to that question is: that the filmmakers either created a masterpiece or complete crap. That seems to define the two camps. People who have written glowing reviews and give this movie high ratings are mostly reacting to outside influences ( or they're members of the filmmakers' immediate family), and by that I mean - they hate Tom Cruise, hate Steven Spielberg, are disgusted by big-budget Hollywood blockbusters, loathe overblown CGI, whatever is eating at them, and they defend this version BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE OTHER ONE. This is not useful to folks reading this website who want to know if they should invest their time, and money, in purchasing or renting this film. The sad fact is, all ""controversy"" aside - this film has no entertainment value of any kind, and I mean MST3K or otherwise. It's a spirit-crushing three hours long, filled with half-baked concepts and design, and has the lowest level of filmmaking craft that one might ever see in a film actually for sale in a legitimate DVD outlet [...] Maybe this film could exist as a student project (as a former college professor I'd give it a C-), as a ""home movie"" for your friends to enjoy (look there's cousin Bob being eaten by a Martian, that's so cool!), even as a pilot to seek funding for a real movie...but as a commercial product that you would expect innocent consumers to purchase?

Everything about this film is bad. The acting is amongst the worst I have ever seen. Throughout the film the cast look completely bemused, perhaps, seeing how bad the film is they were waiting for their pay cheque to chear before doing any ""acting"",  by the looks of things those cheques never cleared! The ""special"" effects wouldn't have looked out of place in Tron, and even then they would have looked dated.

Its only redeeming value is that it followed the book exactly.  Might as well listen to the book on tape.  I can't believe that this thing was even sent to the market.,1121212800,14,470,4.261363636363637
2312181,1,B0009PW4D2,"It's hard to know where to begin. Were it not for the interviews by the director making outrageous claims that ""our effects will be state-of-the-art,"" I might be more lenient. If this were a school project made by enthusiastic 10-year-olds, I might be more forgiving of the otherwise unforgivable lack of direction, editing, effects, sound, and acting. I mean, it's just all bad. This is the sort of project that one would call campy, but the problem is the production set out to make something to be taken seriously...and they have failed miserably. I've seen low-budget, tongue-in-cheek send-ups of genre films that can be fun. And when you take them in the context they present themselves in, they are acceptable and entertaining. But this film would have you believe it was a slick independant project with first class production values. That the lead, Anthony Piana, is ""the next Al Pacino."" When you spew out such reckless claims, you'd better be able to back them up. Instead, this film buries itself under the dead-weight of a no-talent cast and crew.

There's absolutely no reason this thing had to be three hours. It watches like an initial rough cut. The decisions made regarding some of the effects are mind-boggling, particularly with the creatures and the cylinder. Some effects, like shots taken during midday, and key out part of the blue sky so it looks like night time, fail because they have no basis in reality (should have done day-for-night...it's easy and it would have made a BIG difference). I had read earlier that the film employed a cheap sepia effect to give the production a vintage look. This is true in some scenes (although they're WAY too orange), but for some reason it is only occasionally employed, which only further adds to the frustrating experince of watching this amateurish stink-fest. Mixing sepia and full-color should establish a reason, like in ""The Wizard of Oz.""

No one with any sense of successful filmmaking would recommend this video. The tragedy is with the resources the production claims it had, this could have/should have been a winner. Bottom line: these people have no business in the entertainment business.",1121126400,13,2168,4.96969696969697
2312182,3,B0009PW4D2,"When I heard that Steven Spielberg was filming WOW I hoped he would set it in turn of the century England as it is definitely a period piece.  So when I saw this DVD I thought I'd get a copy even though the reviews were mixed.  Let's face it, the fact that there are 337+ reviews of this DVD should tell you that this movie engenders a lot of feelings, one way or the other.

The good point is that it is true to the book, which is something that sci-fi fans want.  The special effects for parts of the film, especially the tripod war machines, aren't bad.  There are three problems however that should have been addressed before releasing this film.  Problem #1: This film is way, way too long due to very, very poor editing.  Cut this film from three to two hours and you'll have a film you can enjoy.  In fact, if the director doesn't edit and re-release it I can see where pirated and re-edited copies of the DVD would sell better than the original!  Problem #2: The color is not true from scene to scene.  Much of the film has a sepia tint, which is okay because the director wants us to feel like we're watching an old movie.  If fact, in some scenes the frame rate makes the movie a bit jumpy like looking at a film from the 1920's.  However, for no apparent reason, some scenes are tinted blue.  This makes no sense and is quite distracting.  Problem #3: The quality of the special affects are uneven.  The Martian war machines are fairly well done as are the Martians themselves.  But the scene with the sea battle is terrible, as the director uses first generation computer graphics.  There are high school students putting out better CGI than this.

Should you buy this DVD?  If you can rent it off the bargain rack for $3.00 I'd say no.  If you are a sci-fi film collector/fanatic and want a copy to compare to the 1953 George Pal version and ultimately the Spielberg movie, I'd say go ahead.

The answer,much like the dvd itself,is a mixed bag. For sci-fi fans who enjoyed the H.G. Wells classic,and who don't mind obvious budget issues,as well as campy acting, this dvd might be ''somewhat'' pleasing. As for the rest of us who have had the pleasure of seeing far superior effects,acting,writting,and directing,this ''adaptation'' will be a waste of time and $. And considering this dvd runs an unbelievable 3 hrs in length,and is at the local wal-mart for $10 bucks,it will be more a waste of time than $. Well at least for those who were able to stay awake during those LONG 3 hrs. You may be asking why this dvd gets 2 stars instead of one. It gets one star for the shear effort of the cast and crew,who tried to do their best with the most shallow of production values,and little or no direction. How upon seeing the finished product one of them didn't come up to the ''director'' and say ''we need to talk'' is a question I would love to have answered. Its gets it second star as a tribute to all independent film makers,who had a dream,or vision, and saw it through. The nerve of the ''director'' showing this to anyone and expecting him/her to take it seriously, is mind numbing. And also asking for,and GETTING,this dvd distributed somewhere as large as wal-mart,is as they say an ''only in America'' thing. For that fact alone I was tempted to give it a 3rd star. Thank goodness the memory of seeing the lead actor do nothing more than run back and forth for 1/3 of the dvd,brought me back to my senses.

2312185,2,B0009PW4D2,"This is about as far as you can get from Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds.  Spielberg's version moves very quickly with gorgeous special effects but basically throws away the book except for the beginning and ending narration and the tripod machines destroying everything.

This version tells the story in the book, but really lacks in the special effects department, and that's putting it charitably.

I won't repeat what others have said, but I think this was a basically good idea that didn't go far enough.  They began with old silent footage to introduce the story and then went into a ""talkie"" movie with all kinds of tones to make it look old.  A lot of footage went by while actors showed various emotional expressions on their faces without saying anything, just like the old silent films.

So, why didn't they just make a silent film?  They could have used modern technology to create a faux silent movie of the War of the Worlds in black and white, looking like it had been created in the 1910's to depict something that had recently happened.

They still would have to bump the effects up a notch.  For example, rather than creating bad computer game animation of an ironclad on the water, go buy a model of an ironclad, put it out on a lake, and blow it up.  That would have been better.

The upside of this movie is that it could probably be edited to half it's length without losing much in the way of plot progression, and then it can serve as an episode of a ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" type of show sometime later this century.",1120953600,10,1552,4.546762589928058

The screen saver stuff reminded me of ""Mary Poppins""...if ""Mary Poppins"" were blowing up...  And, what about that Anglican priest?  Was he comedy relief,or what?

One interesting point is the moustache that the main character has. It looks pretty well pasted on and the guy goes through weeks of hell evading the aliens and never even has a five o'clock shadow by the end of the movie.

I'm a closet sci-fi fan, and liked the book and even the over-the-top 60s (50s?) movie version.  I hadn't heard of this production, but figured it was a made-for-cable effort or somesuch that I had overlooked.  Uh, wrong.  This is an amateurish movie that was either some kind of student film, or (my guess) a quickie attempt to cash in on the Speilberg movie.

This movie seems to follow the storyline of the book (from what I remember), and appears to be an attempt at a period piece, as opposed to a modern-day retelling.  That would normally be OK.  But the scenery all looks like rural Pennsylvania, not turn-of-the century-London (except, of course, the cliche shot of Big Ben, wink wink, to let you know you're in London). And there's no sense of pace or drama whatsoever.  Whereas the book was fast paced and even a little creepy, this movie just plods along with no suspense whatsoever.  And make no mistake, that's Plods with a capital ""P.""

Every aspect of this was so awful- especially the acting and the British accents - I kept expecting it to turn 'camp' (like a Troma film), but it didn't.  They played it straight and came up with what is probably the most complete dud I have ever seen.  If I had to find one thing to compliment, I'd have to say the music was fairly decent.

I'd be inclined to give this two stars just because they took a shot at bringing a classic novel to film.  But that they're doing it *now* is just a flagrant attempt to cash in on Speilberg-War-of-the-Worlds-mania, and I would withdraw BOTH of those stars anyway (if I could) because the finished product is SO pathetic.",1120780800,13,1822,4.509146341463414

2312191,1,B0009PW4D2,"I am a HUGE fan of the original book and have been waiting years to see an faithful adaptation of it.  THIS ISN'T IT BY ANY MEANS!  I had thought that Roger Corman's Fantastic 4 was the worst, but this one takes the cake.  I wish that Mystery Science Theater 3000 was still on the air because this thing is a comedy gold mine!

I understand low budget films, I have many in my collection.  I can forgive bad acting (with even worse accents), 'not so special' effects, and not very convincing CGI.  However no dollar amount can save a film from a director that lacks a sense of narative, the concept of tension, what a scene actually consists of, and when to edit said scenes.

The movie is 180 minutes long whose bulk of time follows the main protagonist: walking through empty fields, running through empty fields, walking through the woods, stumbling through empty fields sans shirt (while falling on his back three times in the course of what feels like 10 minutes, moaning as if in labor).

The director tried to go with a stylized look throughout the film using various stock video filters.  The problem is that the color of the filter would change within the same scene depending on what angle the camera was shooting at (look everything is orange, no wait now it is blue, hey its orange again!).  Another annoying artifact was that the film seems to pause for about half a second every thirty seconds or so giving the appearance of streaming video having bandwidth issues.

The special effects.

1) All fire in the film is computer generated, however the animation frame rate of the flames does not match the frame rate of the film.

2) The Martian's heat ray isn't a ray at all, just multi colored lights that flash on the screen.  Ok, so physicall the beam would be invisible, but then how do the characters deduce that the aliens are indeed firing rays of energy?

3) Heat Ray Death Scenes.  I haven't laughed this hard in a while.  The price of the DVD is worth this comedy nugget alone.  People are reduced to skeletons that are also badly rendered CGI.  How hard is it to do a skeleton?  I don't know, but if a person is zapped with a heat ray that removes all flesh and clothing, why then is the skeleton wet in appearance.  And how exactly does a skeleton writhe in agony without muscles let along a functioning brain?

4) The best scene is when a tripod crashes into the 'River Thames' - the splash it creates makes any episode of Doctor Who look like Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings.

5) Another humorous scene is a crowd panicing in the streets of 'London'.  This was accomplished with looped CGI animation of filmed people.  In one quick scene a small group of people just disappear because their animation stopped looping!

6) There is one scene of a woman singing an opera in a crowded opera house, but I have no idea why.

I would say 'nice try' but I cannot.  And I am not even going to talk about British soldiers without helmets or rifles.  I do recommend this movie because it is destined to be a classic, but for none of the reasons the film makers think (Plan 9 From Outerspace anyone?)!

2312192,5,B0009PW4D2,"I simply adored watching this movie. It's not a hollywood blockbuster special FX movie. It's more like Never Ending Story. It's set in 1900 Dickinsian England like A Christmas Carol and you are completely transported to another era of gentlemen and ladies, culture and apertiffs. And then eruptions turn to flashes turn to falling stars turn to...Martians.

It was pure fun.

It begins with the Narrator taking us into the time before through old documentary footage like the Road Warrior. This changes into color like the Wizard of Oz, only much faster. Then the story unfolds. The Narrator meets Ogilvy, a popular astronomer who tells him about the activity on Mars, so the Narrator can do a story on the subject. He and everyone in general think nothing of the strange flashes and falling stars. Then Ogilvy sees a falling star literally crash and goes to investigate.

This reveals the fallen meteorite. A bit of chaos ensues, and most fascinating is that this, in the year 1900 is the most exciting thing to happen in a long time. People gather as if the circus was coming through town. Fascination then gives way to horror, as the meaning of the meteorite is revealed.

I really enjoyed the Narrator's performance in this tale and his adventures. Tragic and moving, it was all very interesting and stuck very closely to the novel version of War Of The Worlds. The rapor between the actors was very good, and there were comical bits that gave me a much needed laugh through all the destruction.

Quite simply:  stay away unless you're a die-hard Wells fan and have to have everything related to his works, no matter how awful.

I'm a collector of ""fan films"" and a 3D CGI artist, and I have many efforts produced for under US$20,000 and released for free which show far more professional editing, acting and ""special effects"" than this film.  The directing is uninspired, which is reflected in the insipid performances.  The editing is the worst sort of amateurish choppyness, resulting in pacing that is all to often a squirming-in-your-seat-awful dragging out of mundane activities.  The director can't even claim attempts to evoke period moods and mindsets, as he fails to deliver those contexts, resulting in numerous scenes which are just bloat.  This film should have weighed in at 2 hours, tops, and the inability to recognize and edit out the fat is the first and worst sign of an inexperienced director.  Sure, he tried to follow the book (which I have read so many times I couldn't possibly enumerate them, and which I absolutely love every time I re-read it), but there's a difference between adapting a novel for the screen and slavishly copying every written scene no matter how poorly it translates to film.  The latter shows no imagination and little creativity, and is the hallmark of the form this film has taken.

I won't even start in on the CGI, as the memories are too painful.  Suffice to say, given the enormous amount of talent out here that generates studio-quality work for free, just for the fun of it, there's simply no excuse for a supposedly professional film to display the embarrassing level of work found in this film.  I've rolled my eyes at sci-fi fan films that were better than this.

The reviews listed here seem to generally fall into bitterly divded camps- somewhat like the Republicans and Democrats here in Minnesota. I enjoyed the Spielberg film more than I expected, but have always regreted that updated versions need force-field generators to make the invaders impervious.

2312197,5,B0009PW4D2,"I was attracted to this movie as a Wells' enthusiast. I had recently re-read The War Of The Worlds knoing that new screen tellings of the story were coming out. I had also read that this film was an accurate portrayal of the book and that it employed techniques that made it feel like it might have been made in the period in which it was set, that being the late 1800's.

There was so much controvery about and interest in the movie that I had to see for myself.

Well, I can say that I loved this film. It was a very subtle and accurate depiction of Wells' tale. Indeed it does use techniques that make it feel as if it could have been made in the early days of cinema, occaisional sputtering frames, colors that fade or shift during a shot as if they were sepia toned (hand painted frames). Wisely these techniques are used judiciously in conjunction with an overall use of ""faded photograph"" feel.

The acting in this film is solid and in keeping with this period technique. The book has been carefully scripted to properly preserve Wells' intent.

But the real star of this movie, the genious of this movie, is the use of the special effects. I had read that the filmmakers, faced with a Steven Spielberg movie for competition, chose not do their special effects as just cheaper Hollywood effects. Instead, in keeping with their approach of period illusion, created hybrid special effects that are at once modern and impressive, and at the same time turn of the century. I have never seen CGI used in this way. The massive martian fighting machines, the meteorite colliding with the house, all have a feel as though they employ glass shots and in camera effects of another time.

But to go further, this clever movie's employment of ingenious use of special effects honor the memory of the great Georges Jean Mlis, who invented special effects in movies. he made beginning in the late 1800's.

I have clipped this short biography so those who are unfamiliar with Mlis will know what I mean:

Maries Georges Jean Mlis who was born in Paris in 1861 and from a very early age he showed a particular interest in the arts which led, as a boy, to a place at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris where Mlis showed particular interest in stage design and puppetry.

In 1884, Mlis continued his studies abroad, in London at the request of his parents - they insisted he learn English after which they intended him to work at his father's footwear business. While in London, he developed a keen interest in stage conjury after witnessing the work of Maskelyne and Cooke.

On his return to Paris he worked at his father's factory and took over as manager when his father retired. His position meant that he was able to raise enough money to buy the famous Theatre Robert Houdin when it was put up for sale in 1888.

From that point on Mlis worked full time as a theatrical showman whose performances revolved around magic and illusionist techniques which he studied while in London as well as working on his own tricks.

When the Lumire brothers unveiled their Cinmatographe to the public on December 28 1895 Mlis was a member of the audience. What he witnessed clearly had a profound effect upon him. After the show he approached the Lumire Brothers with a view to buying their machine - they turned him down.

Determined to investigate moving pictures, Mlis sought out Robert Paul in London and viewed his camera - projector building his own, soon afterwards. He was able to present his first film screening on April 4th 1896.

Mlis began by screening other peoples films - mainly those made for the Kinetoscope but within months he was making and showing his own work, his first films being one reel, one shot views lasting about a minute.

Mlis' principle contribution to cinema was the combination of traditional theatrical elements to motion pictures - he sought to present spectacles of a kind not possible in live theatre.

In the Autumn of 1896, an event occurred which has since passed into film folklore and changed the way Mlis looked at filmmaking. Whilst filming a simple street scene, Mlis camera jammed and it took him a few seconds to rectify the problem. Thinking no more about the incident, Mlis processed the film and was struck by the effect such a incident had on the scene - objects suddenly appeared, disappeared or were transformed into other objects.

Mlis discovered from this incident that cinema had the capacity for manipulating and distorting time and space. He expanded upon his initial ideas and devised some complex special effects.

He pioneered the first double exposure (La caverne Maudite, 1898), the first split screen with performers acting opposite themselves (Un Homme de tete, 1898), and the first dissolve (Cendrillon, 1899).

Mlis tackled a wide range of subjects as well as the fantasy films usually associated with him, including advertising films and serious dramas. He was also one of the first filmmakers to present nudity on screen with ""Apres le Bal"".

There are also elements that Willis Obrien used in the original King Kong. Some shots feel as though they could be cut together with the original King Kong. The effects have an especially sepia toned effect that brings its own kind of errieness. I was very moved by this film.

Clearing away some of the comments that are obviously made by some biased individuals and the inevitable group that will violently oppose anything new, clearing away those who don't understand anything that isn't an amusement park ride on the screen. This movie is cutting edge in using CGI in new ways. the filmmakers said they were not satisfied with just making a lower budget version of a typical Hollywood movie, so they created an entirely new kind of movie. Just as H. G. Wells created an entirely new kind of story telling. H. G. Wells would be very proud of this movie.",1120608000,3,5852,4.701857282502444

Well they managed to shoot their picture just before Spielberg started his production and I was excited that they were doing it in the original period setting. I've seen alot of people slamming these guys for years, (they have some pretty heavy competition) but they finally delivered.

And, well. It wasn't what I expected. It was not a low budget Hollywood type film, but a true art film, where they made their movie feel and look as though it might have been made in th late 1800's (if there was sound back then).

2312199,3,B0009PW4D2,"It's wonderful that Tim Hines had the nerve to try faithfully to recreate the original 1898 setting of Wells' classic The War of the Worlds. The filmmakers attempt to engender the sensibility of an obsolete film style by marrying baroque-looking backgrounds and light filtering to modern digital technology. Enough has been said above about the odd mattes and animation, hesitant movements and daguerrotype-style filters they used. For all this ambitious stylization,  it's unfortunate that this film was rushed into the stores to take advantage, apparently, of the soulless Spielberg techno-extravaganza. This project was too intelligently conceived to have ever been a major commercial success, but a few more months in the lab and editing studio could have yielded an art-house classic.

First of all, innumberable scenes of the narrator running through the woods or wandering the ruined streets of Woking and Weybridge (two towns southwest of London which have long since been swallowed up by the modern conurbation) could be cut down dramatically. Some of the day-for-night sequences are so blanched of color that they appear to be film lab accidents rather than ""technique,"" and these scenes could use a little colorization.

Two sequences, however, ought to be re-imagined and re-filmed or ruthlessly excised from the film. The first sequence involves the  debut of the Martian heat-ray weapon early in the story; the incinerated yet contiguous skeletons of the victims continue to writhe after all flesh and viscera has burned away. This looks extraordinarily silly. If the intent was to illustrate powerful thermal convections, it would have been much more effective to have the skeletons break apart and the bones scatter - or, at least, to just lie there and smoulder.

The most egregious sequence by far, though, is the very important  clash between a British torpedo-ram (an early form of battle cruiser) and a Martian fighting tripod that has pursued a sternwheeler full of escaping civilians into the English Channel. This complex and potentially stirring scene should have been the high point of whatever technical expertise the filmmakers could bring to bear on their story, but the warship is so utterly cartoon-like, and its motion upon the water so hopelessly unrealistic, that it looks like the producers ran out of money. The ship sinks of its damage less realistically than some boats I sank in my bathtub when I was five years old. It really mars the entire film, and I'm surprised the producers weren't too embarrassed to let it out of the shop in its current condition. You can add to this lapse the fact that it leaves the ferryboat and its passengers in the lurch; after following them across east-central England for an hour and a half (albeit without an explanation about how they got from Edgeware northwest of London to the Channel coast some seventy miles away within a single camera fade) and getting deeply involved with their attempt to survive, you don't find out what has happened to them at last. This is a colossal malfunction of editorial judgment.

After all of that, the film is still a fascinating exercise in artistic imagination. It would be wonderful if a future version could be taken back ""into the shop"" so that its technical flaws might be corrected and the overall work could be tightened up.",1120521600,9,3344,5.080145719489982

2312203,4,B0009PW4D2,This is the first Victorian War of the Worlds and an outstanding one at that. I had a great time watching this movie. It followed the original book and unfolds chapter by chapter. The actors and scenery was beautiful and I loved the explosive army raids and discovery of the martians. The main man's experience is very fun to follow and his co-stars are both touching and funny. Loved the red-turned martian world and their fighting gizmos.,1120521600,5,440,4.7272727272727275
2312204,5,B0009PW4D2,"I loved this movie. It was how I saw it in my mind whenI read the book. This movie makes no pretense at being a big blockbuster amusement ride. Those who want that might be disappointed.

Though the special effects, as many have pointed out are stylised and surreal, they fit the telling of the story perfectly.

Those who break this movie down on the production value of its special effects alone, are, it seems to me, missing the point and they should probably stick to the big budget chock full of effects eye candy movies.

Not that this movie doesn't have eye candy. There is plenty to feast on. The Martian wars are well depicted with the giant Martian war machines, with their swirling tenacles that snatch people up and toss them into the horizon. The handling machines are creepy, with their multiple spier-like legs and many mechanical arms. Some of the effects are more surreal than others. The Thunderchild battle seems roughed out, but not as bad as some say. The collapsed house is wonderful.

The important thing about this telling of Wells' story is that it is the only telling of his story done accurately to the book to date.

To see the flaws some have written about, one would have to watch the movie fifteen times. At that point, no moview would withstand such scrutiny. Like others, I question the motives of those who hate the movie but have watched it repeatedly to damn it publicly.

The Wizard of Oz had flaws. One can see the painted backdrops and the wires supporting the flying monkeys, but the story is good and who cares about that. H. G. WELLS' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS plays in a similar way. It is surreal. It is stylized. This was clearly a design plan of the moviemakers.

But this movie surpasses the sum of its parts. Some will never see that, some might have motive not to see it.

The majority, I think, will see it in the way I have described. That was how it came to me. It was clear what the movies' feel and approach was from the opening archival footage of actual Victorian England as it fades away into color footage of the story.

The movie uses little clever tricks to remind the viewer that this is not the present day world. Color fades on the print. Sometimes the picture is deliberatley caused to sputter as if stuck in an old projector.

But such techniques are used sparingly. Younger audiences who are only familiar with video and digital technology may miss the subtleness of these layers.

The human drama unfolds skillfully and again, is stylized. But not so much so to be alienating. It is clever and some have used the word fresh. The analogy of this being an Ed Wood movie is far from the mark. Ed Wood was a director who pieced his movie together with whatever footage he could find.

Clearly the makers of H. G. WELLS' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS chose all that is on the screen. Is it a masterpiece as some have said? Time will tell. Is it well done and worth the viewing? To miss this movie is to miss an event. It is worth the time to see one of the most original movies to come along in years. Don't expect Star Wars. Expect something new.",1120521600,5,3097,4.423550087873462
2312205,1,B0009PW4D2,"When I first came to the website I was enthralled with the excitement that was being generated by what was to be the second to none version of HG Wells as told by him and in the era he described.

Out of what orifice did Tim Hines pull this slug??? From the moment the film started changing tones, from color to black and white to sepia, I thought that maybe it was to capture that old silent era feeling which would have been very welcome if that was the case, but seeing as this was not the case as the film developed I became incensed.

The Martian cyclinders and the martians themselves were actually not bad, and the first viewing of the heat ray was true to Wells description, but it was those stupid tripods that looked like they were sliding across the  ground rather then stomping over it that put the final nail in this films coffin. Obviously they were superimposed on the enviorment.

Laughable was this attempt create the illusion of panic by having the same xtras walk hurridley, first in one direction and then back the opposite way.

Was the Thunderchild warship some persons bathtub toy??? cause thats what it looked like in closeups firing at the Martians, without any crew to be seen, not even a couple of CGI sailors.

Ive never felt so burned, and I don't care about the money, I would have been glad to pay double for a 3hr worthwhile film of WOW.

Shame on Pendragon, a pox on all those involved in this sham production, this vaporware adaption.

2312206,4,B0009PW4D2,"I bought this movie with low expectations from some of what I read about its budget. But I was pleasently surprised. Yes, some of its special effects are not the highest end. Although most are very good. The Martian war machines are frightening. The battle scenes are exciting. Some of the scenic shots feel painted. But even these fit the style of the movie.

What moved me was story and the acting. The movie has a Masterpiece Theater quality to it. And it plays kind of like a cross between Dune and Emma. I love the period feel to the movie and, for their budget, they did a nice job of adapting the book. I should say that this version is not the updated version that has been reset in New Jersey. But is a point by point adaptation of the story as written in 1898.

The film somewhat feels like an opera which is appropriate. It is the end of world for the human race and the tragedy aspects are well played. As are the relationships. The narrator leaving his wife in what he thinks is safety so he can go write about the war. The narrator's brother, who meets up with two women travelling alone. Unheard of in normal times in those days, but all normal human rules are thrown out the window as society breaks down.

Some of the best moments are when the one woman sees the ocean they are planning on escaping over and she has a terrible panic attack. They have to drag her as she sobs and calls out for her missing husband. The fight scenes are very real.

The best scenes are between a preacher and the narrator who are trapped in a house that has been hit by an invading spacehip cylander. The preacher is breaking down and the narrator is struggling to hold it together. They argue and eventually struggle over food as as their supplies dwindle.

The ending is bitter sweet and played with a proper underlying tragedy. The music score is classical and large, like the end of the world.",1120521600,8,1895,4.372159090909091

2312209,4,B0009PW4D2,"In 1897, H. G. Wells wrote a frightening series of newspaper stories about aliens invading from Mars. These series of stories were later published into book form in 1898.

Virtually every science fiction story involving aliens since then owes something to the original The War of the Worlds.

This movie telling of the tale is a great effort and deserves to be seen. It is the only time the story has been set in it's correct timeline and the movie makers deserve a big hand for their effortsand the Martian 100 story high fighting machines are impressive.

This story is known for many reasons and millions were aware of it before the current interest arose. It is the first fictional story to confuse the public as is stated in transparency, from transparency now:

The ability to confuse audiences en masse may have first become obvious as a result of one of the most infamous mistakes in history. It happened the day before Halloween, on Oct. 30, 1938, when millions of Americans tuned in to a popular radio program that featured plays directed by, and often starring, Orson Welles. The performance that evening was an adaptation of the science fiction novel The War of the Worlds, about a Martian invasion of the earth. But in adapting the book for a radio play, Welles made an important change: under his direction the play was written and performed so it would sound like a news broadcast about an invasion from Mars, a technique that, presumably, was intended to heighten the dramatic effect.

As the play unfolded, dance music was interrupted a number of times by fake news bulletins reporting that a ""huge flaming object"" had dropped on a farm near Grovers Mill, New Jersey. As members of the audience sat on the edge of their collective seat, actors playing news announcers, officials and other roles one would expect to hear in a news report, described the landing of an invasion force from Mars and the destruction of the United States. The broadcast also contained a number of explanations that it was all a radio play, but if members of the audience missed a brief explanation at the beginning, the next one didn't arrive until 40 minutes into the program.

At one point in the broadcast, an actor in a studio, playing a newscaster in the field, described the emergence of one of the aliens from its spacecraft. ""Good heavens, something's wriggling out of the shadow like a gray snake,"" he said, in an appropriately dramatic tone of voice. ""Now it's another one, and another. They look like tentacles to me. There, I can see the thing's body. It's large as a bear and it glistens like wet leather. But that face. It...it's indescribable. I can hardly force myself to keep looking at it. The eyes are black and gleam like a serpent. The mouth is V-shaped with saliva dripping from its rimless lips that seem to quiver and pulsate....The thing is raising up. The crowd falls back. They've seen enough. This is the most extraordinary experience. I can't find words. I'm pulling this microphone with me as I talk. I'll have to stop the description until I've taken a new position. Hold on, will you please, I'll be back in a minute.""

As it listened to this simulation of a news broadcast, created with voice acting and sound effects, a portion of the audience concluded that it was hearing an actual news account of an invasion from Mars. People packed the roads, hid in cellars, loaded guns, even wrapped their heads in wet towels as protection from Martian poison gas, in an attempt to defend themselves against aliens, oblivious to the fact that they were acting out the role of the panic-stricken public that actually belonged in a radio play. Not unlike Stanislaw Lem's deluded populace, people were stuck in a kind of virtual world in which fiction was confused for fact.

News of the panic (which was conveyed via genuine news reports) quickly generated a national scandal. There were calls, which never went anywhere, for government regulations of broadcasting to ensure that a similar incident wouldn't happen again. The victims were also subjected to ridicule, a reaction that can commonly be found, today, when people are taken in by simulations. A cartoon in the New York World-Telegram, for example, portrayed a character who confuses the simulations of the entertainment industry with reality. In one box, the character is shown trying to stick his hand into the radio to shake hands with Amos n' Andy. In another, he reports to a police officer that there is ""Black magic!!! There's a little wooden man -- Charlie McCarthy -- and he's actually talking!""

In a prescient column, in the New York Tribune, Dorothy Thompson foresaw that the broadcast revealed the way politicians could use the power of mass communications to create theatrical illusions, to manipulate the public.

""All unwittingly, Mr. Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater of the Air have made one of the most fascinating and important demonstrations of all time,"" she wrote. ""They have proved that a few effective voices, accompanied by sound effects, can convince masses of people of a totally unreasonable, completely fantastic proposition as to create a nation-wide panic.

""They have demonstrated more potently than any argument, demonstrated beyond a question of a doubt, the appalling dangers and enormous effectiveness of popular and theatrical demagoguery....

""Hitler managed to scare all of Europe to its knees a month ago, but he at least had an army and an air force to back up his shrieking words.

""But Mr. Welles scared thousands into demoralization with nothing at all.""

There was a movie version of The War of the Wrodls set and filmed in the 1950's and of course, everby must be aware the Steven Spielberg has just remade the story and set it in modern day, New Jersey.

I believe there was one other story of Earth invasion written in the same years 1897-1898, but it slips my mind as to the author and the title. That's a good one for the Wells fans to track down.

Also, I have visited the forums a bit and read the reviews, and Tom Cruise may not personally be writing negative reviews here, but I think his money sure is.

We may be in 3000 screens this week and have taken $204m, but he's in WalMart, and that's got us running scared, I can tell you!

All we've got is a proper budget, an award-winning scriptwriter and actors and crew who know their jobs. How can we hope to compete with a badly shot on video straight-to-DVD $10 disc with no-one you've ever heard of, shot entirely on location in a couple of fields in Washington with CGI horses and cows? We can't. That's why everybody who has ever given this movie a bad review here is obviously me trying to put the little guy down. Seriously. That's why you should ignore every review from someone who didn't like it and only believe the good ones, that don't sound anything alike and obviously weren't written by the people who made the film to sucker you out of $10. Just don't ask why we're putting so much effort into beating up on Timbo's film while we're leaving the other modern-day version with C. Thomas Howell completely alone even though it's much closer to our version.

2312213,5,B0009PW4D2,"I read H.G. Wells' novel ""The War of the Worlds"" in 1998, not long after seeing George Pal's 1953 film version. For some reason, the setting of the novel (The early 20th century) resonated a whole lot more than that version, or other previous film and television adaptations (Including the new Tom Cruise/Steven Spielberg film). Since then, I have hoped that a filmmaker would make a ""true"" adaptation of the novel, and not just a modern ""twist"" on the story.

After only eight years of waiting, filmmaker Timothy Hines has done the closest adaptation possible of Wells' masterpiece, and the wait has definitely been worth it!

Hines' adaptation is amazing, and making it look like early color films was a stroke of genius. While the film does look a bit on the cheap side, the great cast assembled, and some eerie visual effects, give the film an edge over other adaptations. Fans of the novel will not be dissapointed!

2312218,5,B0009PW4D2,"This movie took me by surprise. I was expecting a low budget version of the upcoming Cruise/Spielberg vehicle, but I got something entirely different.

The movie is unique. From it's slow confident build-up, to the Martian invasion, to its moody battles with the Martians and the Earth's fall to their dominance, the filmmaking is resplendent.

Created like an old newsreel movie on a hand driven camera, the very core of this movie is transcendent. It has a commanding sureness of its approach. I felt like I was there, living with the characters as they awakened from their sleepy world to realize there is more than humans at the top.

Director Timothy Hines seems to have bitten off alot as he is credited as editor, photographer and director, but he sustains a balance that is hard to achieve in a three hour drama. I remember the endless camel shots in Lawrence of Arabia and an abundance of marching in Sparticus, and this movie has similar scenes. But they are in the book. It is what Wells described and Hines captures them in a way that makes you feel how hard it was to get around back then.

Some modern viewers might be impatient with this as everything is handed to us quickly today. Buzzing from place to place while taking phone calls and checking in with the internet, I can see where it would be hard for some to understand a time when people did less in a day. When they took time to enjoy a cup of tea or read a newspaper. People mostly walked back then. The carriage was for long journeys and the fast transport was the train only.

If one can slow down enough to let the film take you, it will, and the ride will be worth it.

The special effects are not like effects you have seen. They don't try to hide that fact that they are effects. They are more like jewels skillfully attached to the story. Just enough to fill out Wells'es vision.

The actors did a fine job and were perfectly believable in the roles, save for British accents that came and went from time to time. But this was not a distraction as the characters attempts to grasp what was happening all too quickly to their world was right. Jamie Lynn Sease did a superb job as a pouty young girl trying to be a woman and take care of her sister-in-law who is falling apart under the pressure. Anthony Piana is subtle and very watchable. Susan Goforth does a fine job as a sheltered wife who wants more freedom to decide her own destiny.

The music blends nicely with the style, which in itself is a tribute to musical scores that were once fuller and allowed to support the film. The Martian theme is done with heavy brass and the humans theme is done with strings. The writer's theme is light at first then slowly transists to a darker more serious mood. The artilleryman has a drum theme and human death's are scored with an operatic scope.

This was a film like no other. A bold and masterful work that will absolutley not appeal to some of the post video game ultra stimulation needing crowd. This is not the Fast and the Furious. This movie unfolds like an enchanting dream that slips into a gothic nightmare.

My favorite scenes:

1) When the astronomer first explores the pit and the molten meteorite.

2) The first big battle where all the soldiers and cannons are wiped out by the tripods.

3) When the narrator and his wife watch buildings blow up all around them and then their ownd chimney's are blown up.

4) When the narrator and his wife part at his cousin's house.

5) The fighting machines in the woods all around the narrator's horse cart.

6) The horse cart soldier comes into the town as tripods walk through and step on a woman.

7) The fighting machine stumbles into the church steeple and knocks it down.

8) The people boiled in the water with the heat ray.

9) When the fighting machine walks right through a big heavy cannon like it were paper.

10) A house being sprayed with black smoke.

When a tentacle pulls the pastor out through a whole in the collapsed house and then comes back in for the narrator who is hiding.

11) When a handling spider walks into a house.

2312221,1,B0009PW4D2,"When I first heard that this movie was going to be coming out, I was very enthusiastic about it.  This is a fantastic concept, doing WotW just as Wells wrote it, and I eagerly anticipated seeing it.  That feeling, as it turned out, was entirely misplaced.  I turned it off when it got to the scene where the Narrator has the accident with the dog-cart, when the horse got spooked by seeing a Martian fighting machine in the midst of the thunderstorm.

The biggest problem here is that these are some of the cheesiest special effects I have ever seen, other than in the Doctor Who TV serials.  Unlike the Doctor Who series, this story is not saved by intelligent scripting and good acting.

I can tolerate a certain amount of lack of realism when it comes to the ""sci-fi"" parts of a film -- it's difficult to realistically depict things that do not exist in our mundane world.  In this film, though, I began to be uneasy very close to the beginning, when the Narrator and his wife are walking through a sun-dappled (!) landscape, and are looking at the stars in the sky -- it took me a little while to realize that this was supposed to be night-time!  I wasn't impressed by the rainstorm that looked like a snowfall, either.  This really is the worst feature of the film, the fact that the special effects are not even up to the standards of realism of the year 1950, let alone 2005.  It is in my opinion ridiculous that the 1953 George Pal production of WotW would have better special effects than this movie, but that is indeed the case.

As for the acting (and, by implication, the directing), this reminded me of something made-for-TV.  I was really annoyed by the characterization of Ogilvy; I have no idea why the character was written this way for the film, but he came off as a bad example of a stereotyped scientist in a children's TV show.  I became glad that he gets killed off early in the story after about two minutes of him on-screen, because it was painful to watch this low-talent ham acting.

The other characters were not as badly portrayed, but none of them seemed to have what I would think of as ""presence.""  I suppose that they must have been paid the actorly equivalent of minimum wage -- and, as in anything, you get what you pay for.

Another thing I always pay attention to when watching a film is the soundtrack.  This film's soundtrack sounds cheap and generic, and at points is actually reminiscent of a TV sitcom.  I personally prefer a minimalist approach to a soundtrack -- to hear what I mean, watch the 1970 version of Get Carter, starring Michael Caine, or any Stanley Kubrick film, and listen.  The minimalist approach to soundtrack music is especially useful when it's a low-budget project, as in Get Carter (In that case, I think the producers had to throw out the soundtrack in order to pay Michael Caine -- and this was indeed what I'd call wise budgeting!).

My final thought for this review is that the producers of this film should not have wasted their money in this fashion.  A project of this sort is extremely ambitious -- in this case, bringing a true-to-the-author's-vision rendition of one of the greatest science fiction stories ever written to the screen -- and it strikes me that this is one of those things you either spend at least $50 million on, or don't attempt at all.  I don't know what the actual budget was, but for this money they probably could have made a nice little movie that people would have liked, and that would have gotten them ahead in their careers.  What they actually got was an abomination and an atrocity, a total waste of time, money, and effort.  I seriously doubt that participation in this project will look good on anyone's resume.",1120435200,9,3715,4.535232383808096
2312222,3,B0009PW4D2,"I came across the Pendragon Pictures website a while ago, and was intrigued by the idea of a movie made ""true"" to Wells' vision and time, i.e., circa 1900. The movie supposedly had an ""eight figure"" budget, putting its funding on a par with the original Star Wars movie. Factor in 30 years' inflation, but make allowance for improved CGI, and I expected something on a par with the made-for-TV specials you see on the Sci-Fi channel.

First, the acting . . . it's nice to see the director didn't waste money hiring overpaid professionals, instead casting his friends, family, the girl next door, the old man down the street . . . I hope that filming didn't take these folks away from their day jobs for too long.

And the heck with getting the actors' clothing from a professional costuming company - it's good to see they supported the British version of your local Salvation Army thrift shop.

The color of the movie appeared to have a sepiatone cast, and the motion of the characters in many instances was ""jerky"" . . . perhaps they were trying to emulate the effects you'd get from old-time ""hand cranked"" movie cameras?

Except for the ""Thunder Child"" sequence which was just plain awful (instead of really, really, low grade computer graphics  they should've used models in a swimming pool like those old WWII navy movies) the special effects reminded me of nothing so much as those cheap old 1950's monster movies - you know, where aliens invade and hide out in a cave, or where radiation mutates insects into giants . . . some examples would be ""Them"" with giant ants and ""Beginning of the End"" with giant grasshoppers attacking Chicago. Here we have lots of ""blue screen"" work, fake horse carriages, and Martian walkers that vary in size from scene to scene. (What was the name of that giant spider movie where the spider varied in size from a car to a 3-story building from scene to scene?)

And the damage done by the ""Heat Ray"" . . . superimpose fake flames on the target, then stop the camera, move the actor, put in a burned ""victim,"" and then restart the camera. Wow - just like the '50s!

For cannon shots, film the cannon and when it fires, simulate the muzzle blast by superimposing a picture of a firecracker going off. Again, just like you'd see in the '50s!!

With these criticisms, you might wonder why I still give it 3-stars . . . well, that's because 1) It's the first ""period piece"" telling Wells' story; 2) the DVD was cheap; 3) I grew up on cheap sci-fi movies and this movie has the same production values, and finally 4) at least the attitudes of the circa 1900 Brits came through.

Go in with the right attitude yourself, and you might enjoy it. But if you hate the old-time sci-fi giant monster movies, stay away.",1120435200,7,2745,4.540485829959514

2312224,4,B0009PW4D2,"For me this film was a tapesrty of rich images woven together in an old kodachrome pallett. H. G. WELLS' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is eye candy for the lovers of art. I read that it is the first and only telling of the H. G. Wells novel. THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is set in the period the author H. G. Wells set they story in: 1898.

Acted in a Gilbert and Sullivan style of ""Victorianized English"", the acting matches the flavor and feel of the movie. The bewilderment of the humans as they uneasily begin to accept their defeat by the Martians hits the nail right on the head. Being lazy and letting things happen, which is Wells' intended point, is not missed by this film.

The special effects are not commonplace. They are hard to describe in the way Andy Warhol's work is hard to describe. The martian walking tripods will make you feel uneasy with their freakish erratic and sometimes seeming unwieldy movements.

The musical score reminded me of scores from the past. Large and powerful with clear themes and strong support for the story.

2312225,3,B0009PW4D2,"It's not a bad film, it's just different. I think it was a good way to tell War Of The Worlds.

The thrust of the movie is about martians invading the planet and turning us into the ants beneath their feet. As the Martians deploy their machines mess with the sky and make the sky shift into different lights at different times, casting the world into different colors as time progresses, with a weird all-encompassing red stage that's most memorable. Even if you're not into the action and the martians and the rest of the movie, fans who appreciate unique visuals in cinema have got to see this one.",1120435200,6,600,4.504587155963303
2312226,3,B0009PW4D2,"No, that's not a typo in the title. I am absolutely stunned at the flaming going on for what is supposed to be a movie review/commentary.

Since everyone else seems to be either 1-star or 5-stars, I am going to prove that I don't belong to either camp. I give the movie 3-stars.

I first found out about this film about a year and a half ago while researching a chapter on a book I'm writing on War of the Worlds and its social impact. I must say I was very excited to find out that someone was trying to film the novel for real, and not trying to update the story to make it more ""relevant."" I have to applaud Pendragon for sticking to their guns on this one.

Downside? Well, Timothy Hines has shown that he is no Orson Welles. He is credited with direction, cinematography, editing, and co-writer. He should have left the editing to someone who understands pacing. When Wells describes the protagonist running home in terror after first viewing the Heat Ray, it only takes a few sentences. We don't need to see five minutes of screen time showing the entire flight home. Conversely, the end of the film seems quite rushed. After escaping from the collapsed house, the movie bounds to the end bypassing the red weed, most of the Artilleryman's soliloquy on the future, the two of them playing cards and drinking into the night, Dead London, etc.

Overall? A very impressive effort, especially considering their limited budget. I was a little annoyed by the post-processing that others have commented on to make this look like a vintage film from close to the time of the story, but once I realized that this wasn't a defect in the disc, I thought it an interesting artistic decision. I thought the casting (no one was over 30 except for Ogilvy) was perfect and the costuming and other art direction perfectly captured the late Victorian era. The Martian fighting machines, while faithful to the description in the book, looked too contemporary and insect-like. I was hoping for something more like the teetering tripods of Warwick Gobles's original illustrations that issued green smoke from their joints when they walked and had the Martian, visible, in the swiveling turret at the top. On the other hand, the entire sequence in the collapsed house was EXACTLY as I imagined it when reading the book. It's the best paced and directed sequence in the film.

For the price this disc is down to, how can you go wrong? If you don't want to buy it, at least go out and rent it. Watch it over several nights like a mini-series (that's what I did) and it will seem much less tedious.",1120348800,9,2579,4.585683297180044

The Martians coming down from Mars and the cylinder firing is very accurate and one of the best sequences in the movie. The destruction of Horsell, Woking and Shepperton are superior.

Interestingly, a lot of the suspense and details Wells works depends on the absence of news. This is set up with the narrator asking for news from the paperboy and neighbor before the Martians reveal themselves to be hostile. Also, the narrator's brother is in London, not that far from Woking, and he has no idea that the aliens have invaded and destroyed so much. While we see the narrator fleeing, his brother is hearing that the telegraph lines are down and the trains aren't running. Very well done.

My favorite part is the narrator and curate in the collapsed house in a Martian pit. The deterioration of the curate and his need for food is very well done.

But then I saw something else. This film has some hefty competitors. I could see where the makers of this film have had to fight fight to make this movie when a major Hollywood studio decided to make it as well.

I could go on for days about the tricks the big studio has used against the small production. Untold attacks, simultaniously saying that they are small and don't matter and at the same time part of a vast secret conspiricy  to get their film marketed.

This movie is good because it is good. I enjoyed it. Period.

I read comments on internet movie database between the competitors of this movie that it is not enough that they are posting a stream of fake one star reviews filled with unbalanced and vicious attacks, but they discussed a way to cut and paste their false reviews and slanderous comments to keep them at the top. I suggest anyone writing an actual review that wants it seen, go back from time to time and cut and past it at the top as well.

I have written a detailed letter to Amazon to see if there is anything they can do to stop this sad approach by this movie's competitors. I liked this movie and there are those who want to supress any view that says anything other than the Spielberg version will cure your cancer if you go see it.

And it is sad indeed, to see the lengths to which these competitors will go.

This putrid garbage is about 75-80% accurate to the spirit of the book (no black smoke guns or steam sprays, the Red Weed appears as a cheap matte effect around the edge of the screen, Dead London is glossed over, the mass exodus by sea consists of one paddle steamer bearing four passengers, the later encouter with the atillery man and his plans for a Brave New World, hardly feature) and so woefully excuted that it is beyond worthless.

The acting ranges from adequate (Susan Goforth) to dire (Jamie Lynn Sease). The special effects are so awful it doesn't bear consideration and as for the 'authentic' and 'accurate' portrayal of 1890's England...well more like betrayal.

If your idea of Woking in 1898 is a collection of photographs of early 20th Century semi-detached houses badly superimosed into an overgrown field then you won't be dissapointed.

as a huge fan of the book and an English man, not only am I disapointed, I'm furious.

And that's quite aside from the outrageous claims that this tripe cost $42 million (I'd be surprised if it cost $42), was shot in this country and has special effects to rival the Matrix.

Lies, all of it.

This film has been compared to the works of Fritz Lang, David Lynch and even David Lean. Its not really even fit to be mentioned in the same breath as those masters.

First of all the marvelous accuracy to the novel it is based on, H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds. Rural trails and landscape are shown with skill. The fanciful locations of horsell common and the meteorite and the countryside where more meteorites crash down obliterating the farm houses is quite wonderuful. As is the observatory and the spotted dog pub.

The music is another high point. The composer has created a very emotional string-filled score that captures both patriotism and sorrow.

And also, the interactions between the main characters. The actors are very connected to each other and there are many scenes that stand out for the way the actors work so well together. Particular highlights are Ogilvy, Henderson and bunch in the woods around the pit, the writer and wife separating, the Elphinstones deciding what to do while on the side of the road, the writer and curate eating in a house where the curate can't help by make noise and endanger their lives, and the artilleryman telling what happened on the common to the writer at the writer's house.

Though slow moving at times, the cast makes up for it with chemistry and the action scenes of war and destruction are mythically stunning and will leave a vivid impression on you.

As you may know, the story takes places in Victorian times at the turn of the century before cars and cell phones, TV and video games. The filmmakers chose well to keep the story set in its original period and location. To look back to an age where society was so preoccupied with mannerisms and etiquette displayed the air of arrogance in a gentle way that was needed to propel the story and the plausability of Martians coming down from space and taking over the planet. It's as if we are looking back at an event in history, that we have learned from this experience and have grown as a society since 1900, but if you haven't heard the story you should sit down and see it unfold so you too can be a little wiser and little more tuned in to the heart of humanity. In a funny way it reminded me of the original THE GRINCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS, like a fable come to life.

The characters of the film are well portrayed and the most three-dimensional representations of these well known characters I have ever seen. The narrator, or writer as they call him in the movie, is who's eyes we see the story through. He could be any of us. He's middle class, middle of the road and not really effecting the world for better or worse. And still he is portrayed with very specific detail and complexity. The actor in every scene shows us his world is rich in detail and that there is a complex set of relationships going on whether its between him and his wife, him and the servant class, him and the upper class, or him with authority figures in the military and/or church. I was very impressed with the fellow portraying him and easily followed his journey never leaving his skin.

All the supporting characters were good as well, but the most intriguing were the Martians themselves. This is the first movie adaptation of the book where I got the sense that they were intelligent life from another world. The Martians in this movie do regard us with envious eyes. The do treat the humans with ill regard or with no regard--like ants.",1120348800,14,2477,4.425438596491228

Secondly, I only gave this ""movie"" 1 star because there is no way to rate it with negative numbers.

I won't address the production values - other posters more knowledgeable have done that much more succintly than I ever could.  Suffice it to say that I agree wholeheartedly with everything.  Mr Hines wants to pee on the public's collective leg and tell it it's raining, and these folks have called him on his utter lack of knowledge, talent and integrity.

Onward, then.  And these observations are presented in no particular order, except as they occur to me.

Anthony Piana as both The Writer and his Brother was apparently paid by the mile.  If the man is ever cast in anything again, and I devoutly hope he isn't, perhaps he can utilize his obvious abilities as a broken field runner.  As The Writer his mustache was pure Groucho Marx, and his overall appearance was Freddie Mercury on the cheap.  Based on his ""accent"", I would say that he's probably never been closer to England than Peoria.  I noticed that whenever Freddie The Writer wanted to express despair on any one of his interminable walking tours of the back 40, he would fall down on his back and twitch like a stranded fish for a minute or two.  Then he would fall asleep for a while, and when he woke up he would jerk to a sitting position and yell, before getting up and starting the hike again.

Mrs. The Writer looked as though she had one dress to her name.  Obviously Freddie should have found himself a day job.

When Freddie finds the Artilleryman in his garden, he attempts to scare him off with a conveniently discarded hayfork.  Why didn't he use it on the yard, I'd like to know.

Miss Elphinstone, in the book a woman of rare spirit, is played by Jamie Lynn Sease as having recently received a lobotomy.  She recites her lines with no inflection whatever, and seems to be looking off to the side, presumably so that she can more easily read the cue cards.  Miss Elphinstone is an attractive young woman, but George Romero's living dead show more emotion than she does.

The scene at the River Wey, where Freddie the Writer is separated from the Artilleryman and sees the tail end of a skirmish between the Martians and the Army, has some particularly egregious moments.  After an anonymous man is picked up by a Fighting Machine and shot-putted what looked to be several miles, the Machine itself is damaged and falls into the river.  Correctly, Freddie is in the river with several people who didn't want to be shish-kebab but didn't have anywhere to run.  But when the Fighting Machine is hit and falls into the River, the mechanism of the Heat Ray is supposed to heat the water to almost boiling.  The Writer describes scrambling upstream underwater, only coming up for air and a quick peek, the water actually getting hotter the longer the Heat Ray remains submerged.  He describes being unable to see due to rising steam.  Freddie the Writer and the rest of the cast of idiots hang out in the same place, which happens to be the only spot in the river where the water heats up, and then it boils.  The extras are parboiled in a matter of seconds, and are seen floating the way fish do after dynamite has been tossed into the water.  But Our Hero, who is in the same water, is merely uncomfortably toasty, and that is relieved by the removal of his jacket, vest and shirt.  This is, of course, a sop to the ladies who might still be awake at this point, and we are treated to another Death March with a view of Mr. Piana's pigeon chest.

I can only conclude that the woman the Artilleryman saw stepped on by a Fighting Machine was actually a tick which had recently fed.  There's no other explanation for all that blood.

Finally, read the credits.  It appears that Hines had a cast of tens, and this cast doubled as his crew, in addition to playing multiple roles and, among the women, trading off the one sunhat he had available to him.

Finally, I believe that Mr. Hines is the bastard offspring of a drunken union between Ed Wood and William ""One Shot"" Beaudine.  This would make him the shirt-tail brother of Tom Laughlin, and it probably means he wants to be Steven Seagal when he grows up.  All of Mr. Hines toys should be taken from him immediately, and he should be sent to his room without his supper and promptly forgotten about.",1120348800,5,4557,4.4987834549878345
2312255,4,B0009PW4D2,"The fact is, I've watched this movie almost three times through without really knowing why. It's not exactly your typical scifi action flick, but I think mythical is a good choice of words. There are some scenes I think could have been shorter, but the destruction of towns and battlefields was, even in a mythical way, very operatic. I was like whooah. Did you see that. It was mesmerizing, the way the martians ""heat-ray""ed things and their was a beauty to the destruction that made me think about how there is a glamour side to war and how hard it is not to get sucked into the rush of the kill.

The people of this movie were very real and I think the way society was so rigid in Victorian England was very well portrayed.

I haven't read the book, but now that I've seen this I think I might. The Martians and fighting machines and other machines, and ships and cannons were all very nicely done. I especially like the young girl with girls saving the guy by firing the gun. I didn't think he'd walk away from that one then, all of a sudden, this teenager runs back and blindly fires a gun! That was great.

The best part I think was the two guys stuck in the crushed kitchen looking out the little hole. If you've ever been stuck somewhere with even your buddies in a cramped or uncomfortable space (say a fox hole for one), then you know what I'm taking about. The preacher guy turns childlike cause he just can't cope with the super martians. He sort of turns the other guy crazy and you totally see it.

I think cause of the the big buzz about this story right now that a lot of people will see this, and that's cool, cause it's worth it, and very very cool.

Have a good time.

2312256,3,B0009PW4D2,"While 180 minutes long, I can't complain about that.  Many of the movies coming out now a days, in trying to be loyal to their source, are getting longer.  Also, as for the color, I think a lot of that has to do with the slow appearance of the red weed and also the fact that clouds and smoke reflect red from fires and fighting, as Wells wrote about in his book.

Even the tripods and Martians were not that bad looking.  But I happen to be a fan of the Thunderchild and its battle against the three war machines in the novel.  So I have to take two points away for that - that was plain bad.  No way to defend those scenes - Jeff Wayne's video game had better battleships.

Only a sci-fi fan, a fan of Wells or a fan of MST3K should watch it.  With maybe a few glasses of hard cider to soften the blows.",1120262400,7,805,3.9875

The sets and filming are artistic and a bit mythical, and the casting choices are just great. The film is peopled with interesting characters and great supporting characters.

And that's not all. Interwoven in this action-tense war-torn scifi movie is a great sensitivity to the nature of humanity and what calms and fulfills us as human beings.

This movie has excellent music by Jamie Hall. It was the best score I have heard in a long time. It is as much a musical epic as it is a classic epic.

I really believe that this movie reaches a height that isn't tried for today and I commend the filmmakers for boldly going for an original and interesting and also faithful take on this story. I also liked that it really does follow the book closely and doesn't cut or update any of the characters.

Kudos for fabulous Marians and Martian technology. This will be one of the most talked about movies this year and I look forward to their upcoming movies.",1120262400,15,1106,4.744791666666667

The star of the movie is unknown but he did a great job. He was very into himself at the beginning and, as the action builds and explodes on him, he changes in an interesting way. His travel buddies are very interesting and funny in way, but it all is very gripping and intense overall.

This was a great buy, though not the greatest movie, it was good. I got to watch it with my kids and we had a great night. My son loved the heat ray blowing stuff up and the creepy parts. Some of the story was very action packed and intense, so be prepared if you have small kids that this is an action scifi movie and it can be creepy and scary. But for the cost it is a total steal.

2312263,1,B0009PW4D2,"The following is my honest reaction to this film.  I apologise if it is overtly hostile, but it is true in every possible way.

1. I'm shocked that the authors of this movie are so cheap that they could not afford a real boat? The hair of the actors were not even blowing during their oceanic voyage. My uncle owns a production equipment rental company which rents effects fans for 5$ a day!  Could they not afford a $5 fan rental in order to add a hint of realism to this trash?

2. Is it too expensive to wait until night to film the night scenes? Apparently not...because they used the worst night effect lens in the world! All it did was tint the film blue!

3. Could they not afford a carriage? During distance shots the actors look like white plastic dolls on a rocking chair.  The horses are high school level, digitally animated brown blobs! Could they not find real horses? And finally, when the horse and carriage are seen up-close, it's a miniture horse and carraige that would carry no more than a 30 lb. child!

4. The length of the film only adds insult to injury. You would think it was over but then you glance at the clock and realize that there are still 2 hours and 45 mins left!

5. If I had made this movie in one day I would still be embarrased to show it to my own family!

6. The overused unnecessary ""special effects"" were rediculous!  It looked as if the actors were grafted onto the film by a child! I'm still wondering if they had a 6 year old child edit this film.

7. Could they not afford a few extras? Apparently not, because they kept randomly splicing in the exact same footage of people running through the various shots.  The EXACT SAME FOOTAGE was used in the foreground of multiple composite shots throughout the entire film.

8. Could they not use real fire? I guess not because instead they used cheap and fake digital fires randomly placed throughout the shots. It was ridiculous!

9. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy this film; I did.  I watched this movie with 5 other people and we were laughing hysterically throuout the entire thing.  Less than one hour into it we thought we were watching a comedy.

Honestly, this movie is not worth 1 star.  It is a poor attempt to profit off of a timeless classic.",1120262400,9,2244,4.366265060240964

I really enjoyed watching this movie for weirdness. It's photographed like a story book, like Merlin or Farscape. The strangeness made me think about it all the more.

Plain and simple:

If you want a remake of the George Pal movie from the 50's, well done with high budget special effects, see the Spielberg film. It's kind of slow, but the action makes up for it.

If you want to see the H. G. Wells story that inspired the Spielberg movie, the Timothy Hines version on this page is almost word for word, the book. This version takes place in the 1800's. It's fascinating to compare the two versiona dn their takes on the giant tripod fighting machines. This version is also kind of slow.

2312275,4,B0009PW4D2,"What can one say that has not already been said here. There are lots of reviews with good points and some odd ones from what I read are publicists from this movie's competitor. Many reviewers are claiming that publicists are writing on here to discourage fans of Wells from buying this movie in order that they will go see the Tom Cruise movie instead.

I read many of the reviews and I could see that most of the stream of one star reviews are not real.  Because when I don't like a movie, I don't watch it repeatedly and and take complex notes that answer other reviews as if this were a forum chat page. Who does that? When I don't like a movie, I pretty much forget about it and move on.

Not so, it seems, for some here who, as some of the commentors have pointed out, seem very organized in some kind of publicity department with a goal of shutting this lovely fim down.

There are an amazing quantity of reviews here from viewers who didn't like the movie and yet watched it with such focus and intense study as one who was preparing for an exam.

Hmm. I think not. In reading the reviews, I also see a pattern whereas these publicists secondary hope/goal is to degrade all the reviews, thus rendering the review page void. This just reveals them all the more. It's amazing how they state that every positive review is a fake because it differs from their point of view, if one can call it that. I mean if they are paid publicists, who knows what they really think. Shooting down this version would just be a job. wow.

Just my observation. Strange and interesting to watch what the bigger movies do to keep their box office grosses as high as possible.

In any case, I'm sorry to disagree with the publicists who want viewers no to see this movie, but it was very entertaining. That is my view and I am entitled to it. The film told its story well and honoured the book completely. the subtext and and context of the book was there. The characters were well acted.

2312276,2,B0009PW4D2,"My mom and dad taught me that if you can't say something good, don't bother saying anything.  As Spielberg's film was hitting the advertizing circuits, I found out about this other version by pendragon studio.  It's hook for me was the promise to be loyal to the original source.  Here comes the good thing that I have to say about this film.  It was extremely loyal to the H.G. Wells classic that I remember and the antiquated look of the filming was very interesting, with these kind of missing frame jumps and screen color washes (blues, browns, reds used appropriately).  However, with today's special effects technology, it's a shame to blend live action with animation effects that one would grow weary of in a video game.  Although one of my first complaints was the exaggerated walking sequences, with no action or dialog to support them, I came to appreciate it's use as a vision of the period where everything happening is not a short drive away.  However I think a little creative editing could have shaved about 15 minutes from the 3 hour movie.  As my title states, with the effects provided, I kept expecting to see that Wishbone dog, pop out and remind me that it's not about how realistic filmmakers make it, rather it is how we imagine it that counts.  As I started to write this review I was going to give it a single star but since I think that it was a labor of love for someone, I guess I can spare another.

I didn't spend a lot for it so I don't feel a bit gipped by the purchased and I may just watch it again, growing appreciation for the films attempt, but will probably always chuckle at some of the labored dialog deliveries and the effects.

This is by far the most accurate telling of a Wells' novel to date. Virtually every scene is crafted directly from the book. It is so close you can follow along with book in hand. If you do, you find one or two small ommisions at most.

I have read that some have said that this movie projects religion that was not in the book. In actuality, the prayers of the narrator are direct quotes from the book. The references to god are all there. Not a single license was taken. The narrator breaks down and prays that his wife was struck out of existence as opposed to suffering. He prays more than once in the book. H. G. Wells wrote the line about god in his wisdom placing the littlest things on Earth. It's funny how people can get things wrong and then others repeat it.

Martians invade the Earth. They meant to take it and eat us. We're obviously losing the battle, but we must stay hard and survive. That is the focus of the movie. Will the Narrator make it?

I thought the movie meandered quite a bit in the first part then improved markedly with the deployment of the fighting machines.

As effects, well, I've seen better. I can't go along with this movie winning any oscars. But it is a good movie by any standard. And for originality and staying power it was great.

Cold Mountain gets slow at points, as it elongates minor subplots and quickly presents Writer/Wife setup, but still the film works. Many complained about the dreamy CGI, but I thought it was good.

2312294,5,B0009PW4D2,"I read some of the reviews about this movie the New York Post and other publications and mostly they were mixed reviews.

There was something in what all these reviews were saying that made me want to see the movie all the more.

On the one hand there are some obvious people who spend alot of time going around the internet saying this movie is like an Ed Wood movie.

I never saw all of Plan Nine From Outer Space, but I did see the movie with Johnny Depp and Martin Landau as Bela Lagosi, for which he won an academy award, I believe.

Ed Wood worked with the legendary actor at the end of his career. My take on Ed Wood was that he didn't have very much money.

I really liked that movie. It was strange and made in black and white. I was never quite sure why Johnny Depp showed up in women's clothes, but I guess Ed Wood liked to do that to.

And again I was curious.

How could a version of The War Of The Worlds be like this movie?

Then on the other hand there are people who have seen this movie and think it is like a David Lynch movie.

Lynch directed Blue Velvet, Dune and Twin Peaks.

Or like Fritz Lang's Metropolis, a silent era science fiction that was rescored in the 1970's, I think. A classic that still holds up even though it was filmed with a hand cranked camera and silent!

How could any modern movie be like this?

Then I saw the review in the New York Post and the way the critic described The War Of The Worlds made me more curious.

In he quoted a top Wells' expert who praised the movie but thought the effect were not to modern standards. What did that mean?

Then I saw the review by Amazon and the critic said that some of the effects were impressive.

And the Big Ben scene was impressive. Again, some didn't like it. I saw the trailer. I did like it.

Some were saying that the effects were surreal.

Impressive?

Surreal?

LIke Ed Wood movies with aging Bela Lagosi?

Like a classic 1920's silent science fiction movie?

Like Dune?

Belongs on MSTK3000?

What? What?

Well, I broke down and bought a copy. Ten bucks. I spend that on a fast food meal.

Well, I watched the movie and...

It's all of those things! I know it's hard to understand and it is knid of hard to explain. But there is literally no other movie like this.

It far from a backyard production.

At three hours the story takes us through a winding journey of a writer who desperately wants to reunite with his wife whom he put in a small town for safety when the Martian invaders began attacking.

There are parallel stories involving the man's brother and a pair of cute as a bug's ear sisters who are trying to get out of london.

The colors are rich and vivid. The hand cranked old movie effect is only done from time time and is not at all distracting and actually does support the story.

The walking is straight out of the Wells' book and I don't know what some of these other people had seen, but the walking scenes featured some of the most beautiful countryside, England, Washington state, (where I think they filmed most, or according to some, all of it), it was breathtaking and lush.

The Martian fighting machines are very cool. Sometimes stylized, sometimes state of the art special effects. Sometimes mixed in the same frame.

The actors play the movie straight arrow. That is to say, it is not done campy. It is the Wells' book!

It is like Plan Nine From Outer Space, the best of it. In the best spirit. But it's also like Dune, Metropolis, and a slew of other one of a kind movies.

Movies like this never die because they speak the spirit individuality in storytelling. Yes. This movie was not a cutout as I read by some and others tried to say was somehow a hoax comment. But it is true.

Even the people not getting it or not liking it could not say it was a carbon copy of a typical Hollywood movie.

These filmmakers did not try to copy Spielberg, as I understand another low budget did, just to cash in.

They made it their own way. You can see that the filmmakers really really cared about this project and from all I've read had a deep passion to make it.

They must have for all the heat they've taken for going ahead and not stopping even though Steven Spielberg later decided to make it as well.

You can see the passion on the screen. The music score is giant, epic and passionate like the rest of the production.

These filmmakers are the real thing. Orson Welles, who made the 1930's radio broadcast of The War Of The Worlds was persecuted and attacked by the mainstream for years for doing the projects he wanted even though he stepped on some pretty big toes. And now Orson Welles movies are taught in schools.

The filmmakers don't need any encouragement from me. They seem to have the stuff of courage. I think there is few who could deny that. But I send it to them anyway.

Some will not like this movie. There are those that think Macdonalds cheeseburgers are the best in the world.

And there are those who prefer that which is hand made and no two are alike. that is what this The War Of The Worlds is.

I will place this movie in my collection next to my classics. It is a one of a kind.",1120262400,10,5132,4.261633919338159

Trancers was more fun than Blade Runner for me, but I'm not pretending it was better like some people are with this. This is just boring, goes on forever and doesn't care - as long as they've got three hours of something they can call War of the Worlds they can get on to DVD at the same time as the big movie, they don't care.

2312296,1,B0009PW4D2,"Probably because we'd declare war on the US if they tried to foist this rubbish off on us. Contrary to what some well dodgy reviews here say, absolutely no care whatsoever has been taken to get anything about British life right at all. No research, nothing. They didn't even rent a copy of Howards' End to see what Britain looked like. It's horribly inaccurate about the Victorian era, both attitudes and architecture - London is a dirt road medieval city in long model shots but looks just like modern-day Boston, USA in street scenes. 'Woking' looks like the kind of upstate New York place people go for weekends in Woody Allen films. The costumes aren't just wrong country (what are the US cavalry doing in this film in the artillery scenes?) they're wrong century. The accents are some strange Dutch-French-Australian hybrid. And the false moustache on the eyerolling bad acting Freddie Mercury lookalike leading lady - sorry, man (well, he IS much camper than Freddie ever was) keeps on starting to fall off in the wind!

As if that wasn't bad enough, not much of Wells original book survives this clodhopping one-man-and-his-dog home video production. Bits are missing left right and centre, either because they didn't understand them or they ran out of money. Honestly, nations have gone to war over smaller insults than this farce.

A meteor falls in the woods and burns a big pit in the sand. The meteor is an empty cylinder with aliens inside. The aliens seem to need help, or so we just assume. All the tidy Victorians eagerly try to help or destroy the aliens. Then out comes the heat ray!

This is where everybody runs and the martians kick butt and make all the stuffy shirts and corseted waists go wiggly. Curious seeker ""Writer"" -- no name man -- dumps his wife off at cousin's pad and head back to see the military blow up the beasts. Boom! In your face, the martians are the superior being.

Super battles, soldiers blown to bits everywhere. Giant machines walking overhead. Crazy Writer man losing it, finding it, losing it again, and finally finding his head and his way home.

Not uncommon, the bond of love is strong and, with faith in humanity, can gives us whatever strength is needed. We will endure.

H.G. Wells' The War Of The Worlds is about what might happen if we as a society are complacent and arrogant. The martians invading are the way Wells said, ""hey, everyone, what if you weren't the greatest force on earth?"" The morals that come out of the story are ""do onto others as you would like others to do onto you"" and that hubris or arrogance is and always will be man's down fall.

This very faithful to the book movie adaptation illustrates these ideas very successfully with exciting scenes and visuals. There are some scenes that could have been shorter in length, but they were all good. I could see it being turned into a TV miniseries.

Trust me, the guy has nothing to worry about from this practical joke, unless its busting a rib laughing. It's obvious five minutes in this isn't a proper movie, it's all just a big con on the audience. They're trying for something Orson Welles, conning the audience into thinking it's a real movie, but they don't have Welles' smarts. They've got just enough in focus stuff to put together a trailer for this that could look good, but after that it's really, really cheap stuff all the way, like watching a really bad live TV play from the early 70s only with worse effects. By the time you find this out, of course, they've got yer money and you've got egg on you!

Spielberg's film is a long way from his best, but the people who made this turkey on their best day couldn't even hope to be 1/10000th as good a him on his worst. If you want to see a really good version of the film, stick to the old 1953 version, which is better than any of them - and still the closest to the feel of the book!",1120176000,18,1104,4.232227488151659
2312305,1,B0009PW4D2,"I keep on noticing identical reviews here saying this film is faithful to the book. It is not. Either they've never read it or they are lying. There are huge changes to the book, esp. in the second half of the film. This may not mean much if you haven't read it, but things like the Red Weed, Dead London and the Artilleryman's demented dreams of a brave new world, the chess game, digging the hole and all of the last two chapters of the book are completely thrown out. There are other big changes all the way through the film, like setting it in 1910s America, and lots of minor ones (the cousin becomes a woman the hero is leering at over dinner, the Ulla war cry has been changed, the man the Martians feed on has turned into a woman in suspenders! tacky!!!). The biggest change is that Wells' atheist take on events and the powerlessness of religion is completely perverted by the writer director.

So, establishing this isn't really the faithful version they claim should that matter? Not if the film were any good. But it's the worst film I've ever seen. It's not like a matter of taste - oh, I don't like Fellini/Lucas/Leone/Milius/old movies. It's bad as in really, really badly made. Bad acting, bad video cam work that shakes all the time, really bad effects. Not funny bad either, BOOORRRING bad!

Somebody said this was an insult to Wells, but it's also an insult to the audience. Not a faithful version, and not a good film.

2312306,5,B0009PW4D2,"Hello

It is funny reading all the reviews.  Since everybody wants to do the Spielberg/Hines comparison thing, I will too. I have seen both versions, and I must say that I liked the Hines version better. Sure, Spielberg's movie is shiny and loud and flashy...kind of like a great big obnoxious SUV. Sure, Spielberg's movie has TOM CRUISE in it (gasp!). Blah blah blah. Spielberg's movie was just like any other big loud hollywood flic. And I heard tell on Oprah that Cruise and Spielberg each gave eachother expensive gifts of a motorcycle and car for the end of production celebration.  Hmmmm...must be nice. All the ladies on Oprah thought so, by the orgasmic looks on their faces. Oh wait. That must have been Tom Cruise making their botox sweat.

Now take Timothy Hines War of the Worlds film. Let's say you take the motorcycle and car that Cruise and Spielberg gave eachother. Sell them. Now hold the cash in your hand. It would probably be more than the entire budget that Hines had to work with.  With that in mind, One has to be impressed with the result of Hines film. There is a lot of heart in it that you just don't see in the Spielberg movie. Whereas Spielberg's movie was a great gas guzzling SUV, Hines's film is more like a beloved station wagon where you pile all the kids into for a sunday drive. You could tell there was a lot of love put into it. If you don't like low budget, don't see it. If you feel like seeing some unremarkable eye candy that will meld into every other overproduced hollywood action movie ever made, then go see Spielberg's version.

2312309,5,B0009PW4D2,"I admit that I was a little skeptical at first when I started watching ""H. G. Wells' The War Of The Worlds"", I generally do not like science fiction films; and this film is based on the most famous earth invaded by martians story. So I have to admit I was amazed at how good it was.

It is about a journalist(Anthony Piana) and his adventures during the cataclysmic world invasion during 1900 in England. He separates from his wife and hurries off to watch us kill the martians. Then he finds out that the martians have wiped out all the humans! Stunned and traumatized he then sets out to connect back up with his wife, as she's all he has to live for.

On his journey he is constantly just trying to stay alive and is challenged physically, emotionally and spiritually. His struggles are very real and his progression through the days of isolation, panic and fear is right on.

He encounters very real Homeric characters on his way. An artillerman who watched his whole platoon wiped out, and a curate, (a ministry clerk of some sort) who watched his entire town wiped out after giving services that morning. Both of these men are shell shocked like the journalist, but they deal with and fall apart over the human genocide in different ways.

What was great about this movie was that the journalist wasn't perfect, nor does he save the day, but he survives, wounds and all, and managed to keep his sanity and faith in the universe. It was a great story of survival and hope.

As far as the science fiction part, well it was fantastic. The meteorite that falls from the sky is really neat. The martians and all their gadgets are very strange and haunting. And they are spooky.

I've read the book it's based on and I'm looking forward to reading it again. I'd recommend this movie highly.",1120176000,17,1790,4.5092592592592595

The news says there is a box office slump for 18 weeks and the competitors are taking no chances.

You can recognize the Paramount publicists easily. Look for each review that promotes that this film is like the Ed Wood movie, Plan Nine From Outerspace and/or that it belongs on the cancelled show Mystery Science Theater.

They were saying this about the movie months before they or anybody had seen it. They are repeating this statement over and over in an attempt for it to catch hold.

Look through the reviews for yourself and see. I am an outraged fan who somewhat believed them until I saw Hines' movie. Then I could see the corporate manipulation in place. Mounting lies about what is or isn't in the film.

I have read the reviews. I see nothing in the positive reviews to indicate manipulation. I share most of the views of the positive critiques.

Look at the desperation in the negative reviews to push their agenda. Why are they SO CONCERNED that you not see this wonderful film? Who are these people that are so worried for you that they cannot let you watch the movie and make up your own mind?

This movie IS the classic Wells' book.

Because even at only $8 at Walmart I still felt ripped off. The only reason I didn't take it back was because when I show it to other people they go CRAZY at how bad it is. The Reverend Steve at the Church of ED WOOD was quaking in his boots when he heard about this Movie, a new LOW in Cinema. I've shot 16mm features for a few grand that looked better than this DTV production. So based on my 25 years of working the very low end of the business this IS ONE OF THE WORST I seen. Why? Because they reach so high but miss the mark in all but one or two(If that) scenes. About 10 minutes of this 3 hour tale is done well and it  does not look like ANY MONEY was spent on this Tale. I'm sure they spent some money as filmmakers love to spend  $$$  and simple things that could and should be done on set were matted in at what cost and waste and I've seen $500,000 a day blown on the set of MARS ATTACKS so I cut allot of slack to indi projects but really every thing in this version screamed cheap. The FXs look as bad as 1970's THE STARLOST.  I know a guy doing FXs at home on a store bought PC that would hold their own in a STAR WARS movie so it's what skill as an artist you have not just the tools.

I never made my money back on that system but  I am doing a TV show on my Mac so it all works out. Timothy Hines should try and do work he could be proud of and not lie to the public about how much his version cost and how its going to kick all the others *sses. I haven't spent any money on Tom's movie YET but I did buy your DVD Mr. Hines based on all the web buzz you created.  Good Job on that but really deep down you do you know you didn't deliver a GOOD MOVIE to us the Fans. The Jerky Frame rate was a bad idea for a 3 hour movie.  Toss out your software and upgrade with the money you made from this scam. Should people buy this movie ?  I'd say 90% of the people who I showed this to would not. The other 10% saw it for free. I've seen it 4 times. Why. Because I was offered a chance to make a cheap shot on video movie based on a famous book and after seeing this am Glad I didn't because who needs more crap like this in stores.

2312326,2,B0009PW4D2,"Well I've been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time. Finally a film version of War of the Worlds that is actually set in Victorian England with cannons and horses instead of in America with cars, tanks and bloody nuclear bombers. About time.

But WHAT A LET DOWN! Now I can't wait to get out and see the Cruise/Speilberg version (okay so no doubt you good old yanks will save the day yet again but what the hell, it's got to be better than this rubbish).

So why 2 stars? Simple, the closeness to the original H G Wells book makes it worth 2 stars but that is it. Nothing else can redeem this film I'm afraid.

Well actually there is one thing that may do the job, use another piece of H G Wells'imagination, build a time machine and transport this film back to the 1950s then it will beat the hell out of anything else at the cinema. The special effects were appauling and I was praying for a little flying machine with it rays instead of legs from the George Pal version to turn up and start blowing everything up.

The worst effect of the lot? Look at the cover of the Jeff Wayne album with the Thunder Child being melted by a Martian Tripod heatray, that's the way it should look, the Thunder Child sequence in this film was so laughable it was embarrassing to watch, I used to make animations like that on my Commodore Amiga computer years ago.

Okay so a film shouldn't ride on special effects alone but they should add to the story and make you believe there are huge tripod machines stomping all over the English countryside wiping out everyone in their path. There was a BBC series many years ago called The Tripods, their machines were done so much better and actually moved the way you'd imagine (although I have to say that the machines in this film were pretty close to the H G Wells description) the Martian machines just slide and you'd expect a huge tripod like that to have its feet hit the ground with a earth shattering crash and loud rumble like thunder not with the strange ""whoop"" sound effect that these had. And when a human body has been incinerated so much that there's just a skeleton left I'm pretty sure there's no way it can still move!

2312330,5,B0009PW4D2,"I watched Pendragon's version of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS last week and I wanted to wait until I watched the Spielberg version before I wrote my review.

Well, after two tedious hours watching the Spielberg film, all I can say is, I now understand why there were so many angry one star reviews aimed at Pendragon. There must be alot of fear in the Spielberg camp that a little indie film could be so good with so little. And Spielberg has to justify a hundred million dollars spent. I won't review Spielbergs movie here, but I'll just say it was a boring two hours with big special effects adding up to zero.

The Pendragon version on the other hand is the book. It is a faithful adaptation. There are many lies and rumors floating around about it. None of what the negative reviews said were true. The film is not Ed Wood. It is not in black and white with backwards footage as the Variety reviewer said. He must have written his review from a synopsis and other people's reviews.

It is a creative original tour de force of Wells' novel. The acting is tru and the pacing matches the rhythms of Wells' book. The special effect are not bad, just low budget and somewhat stylized.

If you want to see H.G. Wells book brought to life, see this version. If you want to see a slow, bad remake of Independence Day, go to a matinee of the Spielberg movie.

The producers of this version must be resting easy. Their courage at making this picture in the face of the Spielberg/Cruise/dreamworks/Paramount/Viacom machine is inspiring. Five real stars. Well deserved.",1120003200,15,1554,4.535714285714286

How many scenes of a guy running through a field do you need? Sure in the book Wells would describe through first person how the character ran from here to there, walked somewhere, or sat and waited but do we NEED to see it portrayed ad nauseum everytime? Hardly. If you cut out all the scenes of people walking from one location to another or scenes of people just sitting there staring at a wall or each other, the movie would have been about an hour long. It was nice that someone tried to stick to the original story but this was a miserable result. After a while I started humming A Flock of Seagulls ""I Ran"" to break up the monotony.

2312334,1,B0009PW4D2,"This is possibly the worst motion picture ever made. Think about ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" - this Pendragon film of Wells' classic is much worse. ""Robot Monster"" - this version of  ""War of the Worlds"" is far worse. In fact, Pendragon's ""War of the Worlds"" makes these '50's sci-fi clinkers seem like ""Ben Hur"" by comparison. What's wrong with it? Where to begin...

First of all, the script is lousy. Though derived from Wells' dialog in the book, it is stilted and clumsey. This isn't helped by the fact that all the actors in the film are ""community playhouse"" caliber - at best. Th acting is simply amateurish in the extreme.

Secondly, the directing is inept. This director has no sense of pace whatsoever. The movie runs just under three hours and by the time it ends, the viewer is three years older. More than half the film consists of medium to long shots of various characters simply running around. Long minutes of the main character stumbling through forests and over fields and along footpaths where just a quick shot of same would have sufficed, seem to account much of this movie's length. It's boring in the extreme and ultimately, very tiring.

This movie was made on a shoestring budget, and one must admire the folks involved for such an ambitious undertaking. I suspect that the thinking was that compters are cheap, and the tools with which to make the special effects shots are easy to come by, and of little cost. In fact there is an open source 3-D rendering suite called POV-RAY that is free for anyone to download. It consists of rendering tools, modeling front ends and compositing modules and is very capable software. If you have seen the original concept teaser that director Kerry Conran made in his attic in the '90's using an old Macintosh for ""Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow"" then you would know that these types of tools are capable of doing excellent work. The power of the major studios' special effects departments are available for anyone to use. Unfortunately, just as owning a copy of PageMaker doesn't make the owner a talented and experienced publisher, neither does a computer and some 3D software make one a special effects expert. That's the problem here. Whoever did the models of the war machines and the creatures, themselves, did a credible job. One might not agree with the interpretation of Wells' descriptions of these things, but that's a matter of taste, and I'm not going to comment. The main problem seems to be that whoever did the animation of these war machines and creatures hasn't clue one about animating. War machines sometimes walk, but often they seem to just slide across the screen. Movement is jerky and seems, to a large extent, totally unmotivated. The scene where the creatures get in a running battle in the English Channel with a British warship is so poorly animated and composited as to be laughable. And watch the long shots of cavalry horses moving across the heather. The leg motion of the horses doesn't match the motion AT ALL.

This film is overly long, tiring, unsatisfying on every level, and for the most part downright inept. Save your money to see the Spielberg version in the theater. It might not be all that satisfying either, but at least it will be a professional, competently made motion picture.",1120003200,10,3295,4.753496503496503
2312335,4,B0009PW4D2,"When I first saw this film I was at first unsure precisely what effect the director was aiming for: a combination of live-action, CGI, stop-frame animation, and bluescreen techniques, I thought the main intention might have been to simulate a silent-movie aesthetic; the oddly uneven speed of the live-action portions suggest this.  The expressionistic use of color, and the almost surreal effect of scenes taking place where one view with night sky is crosscut with another with day reminded me of one famous painting by Magritte.  The special effects were interesting too, not always wholly convincing or consistent, but often quite impressive: the initial victims of the Heat-Ray, on the common, collapsing into skeletons (yet writhing as if still alive) reminded me of Ray Harryhausen's skeletons in ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (and several later hommages to that scene, including the deaths in Tim Burton's ""Mars Attacks!"")...  on reflection, the effect-- where even the live-action sequences are altered to make them LESS realistic-- seems to me to be a filmic equivalent of a comic book.  Which is not necessarily a bad thing! And the adherence closely to the original book is refreshing, too.  It could have been made shorter by a bit less footage of the protagonist fleeing (though that too is from the book).  But the realizations of the War Machines, the Heat Ray (with its whirling parabolic mirror it is particularly creepy) and the destruction it wreaks,  and the Martians themselves, are quite excellent.

They have just enough to tell the oldest martian invasion story to its fullest as it was meant to be told in its original time and location with victorian lace and fields all around them.

It takes a certain type of story to successfully sell the audience on an antique looking period piece. Tim Hines gets nothing but my humble admiration in this respect as the design work of the martians and their fighting machines, the meteorite crash and pit, the collapsed house, the martians dying, it all provides a visual feast fit for anyone and everyone.

As you know the main character, stranded from his family while chasing the excitement of war, embarks on a journey to reunite with them and it turns into a fight to live and not be eaten by the martians.

Also, if you realize this movie is a throwback to vintage gothic horror movies, you should be smart enough to know the filmmakers were not going for Oscar winning special effects, but for the truth of the story--surviving against overwhelming odds.

His ideas are superb, but obvious constrained by budget. He has a great eye and depth to showing sadness and the inner soul of humanity.

You really feel that you are in a past Victorian world.

Expectations were VERY high for some people on this movie. But I knew it was a low budget Independent film. They did a fantastic job. I wanted to see the original novel made into a movie and they did this well.

Admittedly, this film is an homage old fashioned gothic films like the original black and white Frankenstein. Fragmented at times, but having very strong storylines all the way through the movie.

Undoubtedly BEST of all to me were the scene at the pit on Horsell Common. The meteorite crashes down and makes an awesome pit, then the meteorite cools and changes throughout the scenes until it opens. When the Narrator first sees it it really DOES look like a rusty gas float. THIS WAS GREAT and the best rendition of Wells' version ever told.

Also the ending was very cool. The Narrator and his Wife reunite exactly as I envisioned. This hits the right note.

The actors were good picks. They're all, well, very pretty, even the elderly Ogilvy guy. I would have like to have seen some more older actors. They probably went for young and good looking to sell the movie. However, they all look like the could have stepped out of 1900, and they have the hair and mannerisms to suit each role. As the Martians take control of everything each person falls into disarray quite naturally. They don't have everyones hair grow out (small budget, remember), but the actors show us the progression of time through their performances, the wear and tear of the collapse of humanity comes out in their spirits.

I thought the dialogue was superb, right out of the book and Old English style, like how actors spoke in the old Hollywood system days, like Gone With The Wind. The performers made the dialogue very relatable.

By the way, the Martians are by far the best Martians and most accurate to Wells' description ever made ever. They're not as sluggish as I'd like, but they DO have a tympanic ear on the tops of their heads and oily leathery skin, the ""V"" mouth and sixteen tentacles. That's RIGHT ON. The first people to get this right.

My complaint has to do with the special effects. But in order to have the technology, you need money. Remember there's a Depression going on. When the effects are cheesy, and they sometimes are, think about how you can see the wire on Dorothy's house as she's tumbled off to OZ. It doesn't get in the way of the story if you don't let it.

2312340,1,B0009PW4D2,"First, this is shot on video, poorly. The attempt has been made to make this look like a ""movie"" by adding post color correction which only makes it appear as video run through a sepia filter. The locations, which are NOT in England or anywhere on the British Isles, are repeated and inappropriate to the story.

Second, the camera work is so poor that one is never certain what is supposed to be framed in the shot. Don't misunderstand, if a person is speaking, they are on the screen, but in strange places on the screen with far too much or too little headroom. In other words, someone who has never shot a film before shot this...

The writing is atrocious, and seems to have been accomplished by utilizing not only dialogue from the book, but incorporating descriptive elements and inner thoughts as dialogue. In addition, the words and actions are performed by a cast of amateurs so bad that it seems as though they were cast from children's theatre, or perhaps some repertory melodrama group. I actually would not doubt either assertion.

It seems as though the visual effects work was done with some small models, but mostly Lightwave (which CAN be utilized for professional looking work, but not here) and poorly composited. The results draw so much attention to themselves as being bad that it makes one laugh at those (obviously fake) reviews here and elsewhere complaining about Spielberg's version being a ""CGI fest"". In addition, there are some obvious post effects, such as flash frames, etc. apparently utilized to add ""explosions"" and the like.

[...]
I give Tim Hines credit for staying very close to the book and the acting isn't ALL that bad either. But the look of the movie is just terrible due to overused and badly done CGI. The martian tripods look no better than a rendered scene in a Playstation game. Same goes for the backgrounds and environment. There are even scenes indoors that are blue-screen CGI with very noticeable jagged edges outlining the actor. The way this was shot you'd think that George Lucas did it but with equipment that cost a fraction of what ILM has. These are strictly low-grade 3D models and backgrounds that remind me of clip-art.

Also the sound effects and music really hamper this movie. I kid you not, the sound effects are low-bit audio samples that you'd hear from your computer or on one of those $5 sound effects CDs. The soundtrack is not terrible but it's so overused that it quickly becomes unbearable. Didn't this guy ever hear of silence enhancing a scene? About halfway through this 3 hour movie you're just begging for the music to go away or fantasizing about smashing the composer's synthesizer.

For an example of how cheesy this flick is there's a scene where a martian tripod attacks a town and starts blowing up buildings. One of the legs steps on a fleeing person and then you hear a very low-fi ""AAAAHHHH!!!"" and a ""SQUISH!"". Then when the leg pulls away you see a flattened image with a red circle enlarging to illustrate the blood. There's another hilarious scene where a woman's blood is being sucked out to feed the martians. Well when it happens she turns white and shrinks up like a colorform. It's just so cheesy that I can't believe that this movie is being marketed the way it is. There obviously weren't enough extras in this movie so the director put CGI clips of people dressed in Victorian clothes running by the foreground of the scene to make the scene seem more bustling. That's not so bad but it looks the banner screen saver from a computer. A flat, 2D moving image just zips by.

This is a project that your 14 year old kid could put together on his home PC. This movie is so cheesy that the lead actor wears an obviously fake mustache! Was it that hard to grow one or at least spend $20 on a professional grade fake mustache?

If Ed Wood were alive today and wanted to make his own version of H.G. Wells' classic then this is exactly what it'd look like.

The special effects were sometimes surreal as others have said, but it was never distracting.

If you are looking for nothing but a stream of special effect like the movie Sahara or maybe Stars Wars you will probably be impatient with this movie.

2312343,2,B0009PW4D2,"First of all, I'm not affiliated with anyone, so I have no axe to grind here.  The Cruise movie is gonna make a ton of dough, and I never heard of Tim Hines.  I read all the scuttlebutt about the flick, but bought it anyway 'cause I'm a WOTW fan, and I'm looking forward to the new one this week.  Hey, this thing only cost me eight bucks at Walmart, so I figured, what the heck, let me check this thing out.  I had heard it runs over 3 hours, so I made sure I put this thing on early in the evening, just to watch half of it on the first day.  So here's what I thought:

This movie begins with a lot of dialogue.  Make that a lot, lot, lot of dialog, which doesn't portend well for the rest of the film.  Yes, the special effects are the kind from 'Forbidden Planet' or the first WOTW movie (which was a more entertaining movie).  At times I thought the effects were kinda cool in a retro 60's sci-fi kind kind of way.  Sometimes the dialog did not match the mouth movement, which I thought was kinda odd.  But man, there was just so much talking, talking, talking.....  Just because it's a faithful adaptation of the original material, don't they still have a mandate to be entertaining?

I thought the skeletons thrashing around after death was cool.  The low-grade effects actually work for the movie, because without them, it would truly be a challange to sit thru this thing.  The movie almost works better as a 'background noise' kind of thing; not the type of flick you would actually sit down and watch, but if you put it on while you're doing the laundry or cleaning the house, you can actually get up and leave it for 10 minutes and not miss a thing!

Yes, the horseless carriage reared it's ugly head, and the matte backgrounds were very obvious.  Some parts of this seem to come across as a cheap, silent movie from the '20s (or was it the 30's? I dunno, it was before my time).

I hate to trash this flick, because I know the genuine intent and effort were there, but if you're going to make a movie with no budget, then 'fer chrissakes, make a damn love story, not a 'war machines from outer space' movie.  The catering budget on the Cruise flick probably cost more than to make this flick.  Yes, there was endless walking 'thru the woods which gets very tidious, and at three hours, this thing could have been edited down to two hours which would have made it a tighter movie with more forward motion.  I actually found myself fast-forwarding just to get to something interesting.  Give Tim Hines credit: he actually made a movie with no budget, and we're only here discussing them.  If he made this one, then he's sure to make another and another...

Bottom Line: The George Pal version is better; this one is more of a study in bare bones film making, and the new Tom Spielberg verision promises to rock.  'Nuff said?",1119830400,11,2835,4.344106463878327

Unfortunately, they seemed to think they could pull off more than they wound up being able to.

I mean... there are programs for the pc that are well under $400 that could pull off more dazzling special effects than what they wound up doing here.

Anyway.  There are people willing to forgive the effects, but.. in this age, with effects being able to be created quite cheaply (if you don't believe me, check out some of the fanfilms done for  next to no cash at all on theforce.net... or some of the sample films created using Animation:Master) it just comes off looking like the effects were almost an afterthought, thrown in with little regard to how well they meshed into a scene.

Also, they tended to overuse either the same footage of the main character crossing a particular field, stretch of woods, etc... or they just shot him over and over from slightly different angles trying (with little effort, it seems) to give the impression that it was a different place.

And... Shots of a horse and carriage animation.. way overused.  Not to mention the 'army' animations... blech.

The acting... was not impressive at all. One can make up for a lack of budget.. and suspension of disbelief.. if the actors can carry it... unfortunately.. it just didn't work out that way.

It really looked like, in most of the scenes, that they were filming the line reading rehearsal.. and just thought.. eh.. that'll work.. why reshoot it?

I was very excited to hear that a movie that would closely follow H.G. Wells' book was being made.

It is with some pain that I have to say what I thought about the movie: I thought it was bad, folks, really bad. The whole movie looked like it was thrown together at the last minute. The acting was somewhat better than what I have seen in most porn movies, but that is about as much praise as I could give it. (I found it particularly difficult to not laugh during a scene at the beginning of the movie that takes place in an observatory with 'Ogilvy'.)  The special effects were particularly bad; the vast majority of them looked like 'pre-visualizations', and were very crude. (I am very sorry to say it, but I thought the 'Thunder Child' scene looked particularly pathetic.) I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that most video games have better effects.  One of the most amateurish things about this film was that many of the 'night' scenes were filmed in broad daylight, and little to no attempt was made to make these scenes look like they were filmed at night.  Nearly all of this ineptitude pales in comparison to the extremely sloppy editing of the film, where characters seem to move from city streets to country lanes faster than the speed of light, and some scenes look like they were randomly thrown in,and seem to have no purpose whatsoever.

I am rather incredulous that the site promoting this movie is claiming that it will be in 'select theaters' this month.  Frankly, if I were a theater owner, I would need to see no more than the first twenty minutes of this film before deciding not to touch it with a ten foot pole. I have read other reviews that are comparing this film with 'Ed Wood' type films. If anything, these comments are an insult to Ed Wood. I truly cannot imagine any theater showing this film unless the film's producers were hiring them to do so.

The only parts of this movie that had any hints of quality to me were the scenes with the narrator and the curate at the abandoned house, and some of the scenes that followed. I thought the fighting machines were badly done, not in their design but in their movement. However, I did find the films visulazation of the Martian flying machine very interesting. Even with these tiny redeeming qualities, I think the only enjoyment most people will get out of this movie will be of the 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' kind.

The movie is a disappointment but had its moments in a somewhat goofy way.

Good Points:

1. The story is fairly close to the book, more so than the 1953 George Pal movie which is one of my all time favorites.

2. I liked the music.

3. The martians and their vehicles looked very good and darn close to the descriptions written in the book.

4. I laughed at one of the scenes where a person gets squashed by the machine.

Bad Points:

1. The movie was too long. I echo the sentiment of the observations of people just walking around from place to place.

2. While the music was good, it was used quite overwhelmingly throughout the picture.

3. The CGI for anything other than the martian vehicles were bad, bad, bad. Particularly the naval battle scenes off the coast of England. Those warships looked like first generation color games that I played on my Macintosh IIsi in 1992.

4. If anyone is going to show this film on TV, it will probably be PBS or some arts cable channel.

2312362,1,B0009PW4D2,"Pendragon Pictures, as some may recall, was making an adaptation of the Wells' novel set in the 1890s, as Wells had written.  It was inexpensive, I loved the novel in my youth, and so I went ahead and picked up it.

I shouldn't have.

It's terrible.

This film's running time is three hours.  I kid you not.  The box said that, I didn't believe it, so I skipped ahead to the final chapter on the DVD, and sure enough, three hours.

The film consists largely of seeing characters walk places.  Narrator walks here.  Narrator walks there.  Narrator walks down a path.  Narrator walks past a hedge.  Narrator walks to a house.  Narrator walks through the woods.  Yes, that happens a lot in Wells' novel, but do we need to see that, all the futzing time?  The filmmakers didn't make a film.  They filmed a book.  It's almost as though they said, ""Wells had this on page 20, so we have to have this in our film,"" even if there's no reason to have it.  The film spends five minutes showing hundreds of people being zapped with the Martian heat ray when the crowd has gathered on the common to inspect the cylinder.  Five minutes.  It's as though the director said, ""We've shown this extra looking into the pit, so now we have to see the person charred to a skeleton.""  This is not how you make a movie.

I won't even go into the cinematography, the direction, the acting.  Suffice to say, the filmmakers have no obvious talents in any of these areas.  I've seen Doctor Who fan films with better production values and better story sense.

Three hours.  A waste.

I can only hope that when some cable network buys this for broadcast, they hack the hell out of it to fit it into a two-hour slot with commercials.  The idea of making an authentic 1890s War of the Worlds is a good one.  This film from Pendragon isn't it.",1119744000,21,1811,4.386706948640484

On the physical aspects of the movie, I thought the wardrobe, music and finished sound quality were excellent.

Pendragon Pictures delivers a tender, funny and absolutely touching epic movie, and I mean epic. The story is that of Wells' original novel, where Martians come to Earth after regarding the planet with envious eyes.

The story begins with the eve of the war, as in the novel. The screenwriters have aptly put a supremely summarized version of the very long exposition that Wells wrote into the mouth of Ogilvy, the well known astonomer, played by legendary actor and acting teacher Jack Clay. Ogilvy tells the Writer of the flashes on Mars that are seen during the opposition, the time of year when Mar is closest to the planet Earth. While Ogilvy gives the Writer an entertaining discourse on the planets, the Writer sees another flash from Mars. Ogilvy confirms it.

Then, just as in the novel, the Writer tells that hundreds saw the flashes for ten nights. And the Writer has an intimate walk with his Wife and comments on how safe and tranquil it all seems...then comes the first falling star!

Covering all 28 chapters of this beloved novel into an epic movie is a feat worth noting for all. I loved this movie! The performances were rich. These were real people of depth and soul, with Victorian values, deeply detailed lives, on how to think and behave, how to speak to each other, how to express oneself, then it comes apart at the seams when the Martians reveal themselves to be deadly exterminators determined to take the Earth for their own.

I haven't seen grace and style in a movie for such a long time, I just love this movie.  I hope you all have a chance to see this movie. It is a rich experience.",1119744000,25,1889,4.524926686217009

Timothy Hines is well served by his cast. The principals, Jack Clay as Ogilvy, Anthony Piana in dual roles as the Writer and the Brother, Susan Goforth as the Wife, James Lathrop as the Artilleryman, Darlene Renee Sellers as Mrs. Elphinstone, Jamie Lynn Sease as Miss Elphinstone and John Kaufmann as the Curate are all convincing in their parts.

The acting - I could have done a better job.  The filming - what was the deal with all the colors and the sepia??  Not to mention the ultra-cheesy shots of stationary actors in front of a screen.  The special effects - way beyond ""low budget"".  The special effects are outclassed by almost anything from the 1950s.  The script - all I can say is, it varied between hilarious and nonexistent, as in vast scenes with nobody saying anything at all.

Seriously, I have loved HG Wells' novel since I was a kid and have been dying for somebody to wake up and make it into a movie.  This ""attempt"" has no real excuse and it is easy to see why it sells for $8 at Wal Mart.  Even if you are a WOTW fan like me, don't spend your money on this.  Wells' novel deserves a real treatment - Pendragon should have spent their money on real actors and writers.",1119657600,13,1013,4.21875

I recently hosted a ""Bad Movie Night"" for some friends and this movie was so horrible we couldn't finish it. Don't believe the positive reviews on this site. Nobody in their right mind would vote this movie over 2 stars (and even that's a stretch).

Don't believe me? go to Pendragon Pictures' website. click on VIEW WAR OF THE WORLDS TRAILER. On the next page click CLICK HERE FOR ALL TRAILERS. Then watch them all. Pictures speak volumes. Make sure you have some sort of diaper on, though, as you're likely to urinate yourself from laughing so hard.

Although it is a cheap movie (both to make and to buy), don't be suckered into buying this. Please. You might send Timothy Hines the wrong message. He doesn't need to be encouraged. He needs to be humiliated. Frankly, I don't see how he couldn't be humilitaed by this shiny silver turd, cleverly disguised as a DVD.

Then again, if you really, REALLY like bad movies (and I do mean REALLY like), this might be worth a look to you. Be advised, though: this movie goes from insanely boring to insanely funny at the drop of a hat. The pacing is awful. ""OK, we're walking, we're walking, we're reacting to a cheesy effects shot that's in many cases just a step above Atari 2600, we're walking some more, still walking...""

In struggling to come up with some sort of comparison to watching this movie, the best I can do is this: Watching this movie is like being stuck in a very small elevator after eating 10 cans of beans surrounded by your own inescapable stench, wondering why anyone in their right mind would pay for the 10 cans of beans that put you into this situation, and occasionally laughing at the sounds coming out of yourself (as they can be quite funny).

All in all, this movie could have been cut into a comedy masterpiece of about 30 minutes (TOPS) in length, most of which would be the effects shots and the occasional reaction. As it is, though, the funny moments don't make it worth the while.",1119657600,10,2047,4.521621621621621

2312383,5,B0009PW4D2,"Wow! And I mean wow. This movie took me by surprise. I don't what I was expecting. I read that this movie was a smaller budget than the unsual summer blockbuster, and some of the reviews said some bad things.

But wow! It wasn't like any movie I have ever watched. It was a three hour expreience. I truly felt I was being shown old historical footage of a war with Mars that took place in the Victorian days. The acting was both strange in an old British Masterpiece Theater way and raw and real. The special effects were almost like paintings woven into the picture. I was blown away.

I see what some have said that this movie isn't for everyone. It's not a non-stop corporate-crap roller coaster ride.

The movie expects you to care about plot and character development and it takes its time building up to the first Martian attack.

It is so refreshing to see a movie that doesn't start in the middle for a change. So many picture today start of with 10 minutes of action before they tell you what is going on. This film doesn't. It gives you old actual achival footage that sets the tone. It introduces the characters and establishes their relationship.

It doesn't have a need to switch to a video game action sequence every few mintues for fear that people are not watching. The movie is told like an old campfire horror story.

When the Martian do attack and the human race immediately loses control of the planet, the story and pacing take a very different turn. Scenes of apocalyptic destruction from Martian war machines interwoven with shell shocked survivors wandering aimlessly.  As they are not sure where to go. But don't be fooled, Wells' story is leading the viewer forward to a point. And as any well told yarn, the pieces all fit nicely. And the message is fresh for today's world.

The cinematic style is like old newsreel footage meets art nuevo. I read that the nuevo style was Wells' favorite and the film has many hidden facets that support it in this way. You may not know it is there but it fits.

At last, a movie with characters that are not just place markers for action scenes. A movie with foreshadowing and texture to the story. A movie that takes powerful risks with the cinematic medium.

It was a fresh adaptation. And this is the only movie that has done the Wells' book as written.",1119657600,19,2319,4.5

2312385,4,B0009PW4D2,"Okay everyone. Sorry for the disjointed review but I wanted you all to know what I thought while it was still fresh in my mind. So here it is: I loved this movie. If Hines makes all of his films like this, I will glady shell out the dough.

The movie is a failure on so many levels (CGI, editing, & acting) There is a lot of jerkiness throughout the film. Sometimes I thought .. wow this looks great ..and then another effect appears to ruin it  The acting was dreadful. The music I actually like a lot! Anyways, on with the highlights...

Here's why I loved the film...

Plastic moustaches! LOL

When the cylinder lid falls off - it just slides straight down in the funniest way. Moreoever, when the alien ""pops"" out and ""glides"" across the cylinder...the effect looks like something from Sesame Street (who btw mastered this effect years ago)

The CGI and puppet Fighting machines are hilarious. I love it when it chases the narrator... I've seen better puppets and in Team America (**** Ya!) Apparently when a fighting machine is walking and its feet pounds the earth a *suction cup* sound is made ?!

Houses burning... I loved it.. it's a real movie again (almost) and then the train crashes after the bridge is destroyed... oh no! The trolley from Mr Roger's Neighbourhood!

There is CGI everywhere...hell, I think the actual DVD is part CGI! CGI red weed..apparently leftover props from Yellow Submarine. I loved the dancing skeletons!!! If this shot was not shown as a slowed down effect it may have been more convincing ..except for the CGI flames that always burn straight up! LOL I did love the sound of the heat ray and the fact that you don't see a beam of any kind.

When they are riding in the cart ... look what's hanging on the side ... it's the robot from MSTK3000!! LOL

I was sad to see the cart die so quickly..it would have been hilarous to keep that going...being attacked by machines that were not to scale! The CGI or puppets was hilarious. Some scenes look right out of a childrens puppet show as the cart goes down the road. And I loved it when the cart whizzes out of control, breaks and rolls down the hill with total disregard for the laws of physics.

The Thunderchild battle ... playtime in the bathtub is more like it!! Awesome and hilarious! I've never seen an unarmed warship driving against the current with such hilarity! It sinks just like those little plastic subs we used to play with in the tub that propel themselves with baking soda

On the plus side, comedy flicks these days are made so cheaply and I am not fond of watching them in the theaer. But Hines has made a quality one here.

The acting is bad .. really bad sometimes. When Oglivy was locked in the shed, and trying to talk his way out, I thought i was watching a Monty Python sketch. It's funny, but when no dialogue is spoken, the movie seems incredibly better ... just with the soundtrack ( I loved the music), and for a while, you forget you are watching this MSTK3000 wonder .. but then someone says something and and you are snapped back into reality.

The Curate scene was hilarious. I understand what Timbo was trying to do but how many times do we have to watch them fight over bread? I get it ...he's hungry and losing his sanity. But I could not help thinking the Curate was a lot like Luke Skywalker ...a whiny brat  I would hope none of the actors used their real names in the credits!

This movie is long, people. really long. It should have said SCREENPLAY by H.G. Wells. That's how long it is. It took me all day to get through it! The narrator as he walks the earth (LOL) reminded me again of Monty Python .. I expected a monster to jump out and eat him or something OR I couldn't help think the whole time, ""I bet something really important is going on right now...why are we following this guy??!""

It really appears to be Hines' honest intention to have made a good film, which is nice ... but it doesn't make the movie an ounce credible .. just more hilarous. It would have been funny only for a while if Hines made this turkey intentionally. If only Timbo had swallowed his pride and asked 20 years ago, ""Hey man, could I have a loan to make a student film? He may have been noticed as a man wih vision. But instead, he waited ... waited until about 20 years later and then asks investors, ""Hey man, can I have some money to make a film? and then proceeds to make his student film from 20 years ago that he just couldn't let go of. Then he tries to pass it off as legitimate and say there is room for both his version and Speilberg's. I don't think Speilberg will be too worried.

The only way we call could trully love this film as Hines wanted is for someone to go back in time and drop it off on the BBC's doorstep around

1974. If they had released this in the 70s.. i would have said, ""This movie is awesome!"" No wonder the die hards and fanatics are pissed LOL

Supposedly a faithful period version, it is nothing of the sort. It seems to be set anywhere between 1649 and 1919 in America rather than the south of London and suburbs of the novel. There are a lot of curious and pointless changes to the novel that drag things out interminably. And not all of them are to save money, which is clearly in very short supply here. The writer has no sense of character at all, which is problematic when they do so very little. In fact, the only way to tell some apart is the costumes. This is even more of a problem with many actors taking as many as five parts each. At one minute it wants to be ""Howard's End"" and fumbles awfully, then at another it wants to be an old 1970s video game like ""Space Invaders."" It's a clumsy, artless video made by clumsy, artless people who mean well but aren't any good at their jobs. You actually feel sorry for some of them until you realise that you've paid to see this. Some people find this sort of thing funny, but I felt the joke was on the customers.

Comparisons to great epics and great works of art are odious in the extreme. I kept on feeling I was watching a school play. It's probably the best they could do with what they had, but that's no reason to watch it unless you have children in it. This doesn't work as a tribute to Wells or as a film on its own.

As most classics, the movie is at once a nonpareil experience. It doesn't play down to the viewer, simplifying the message as so many movies do these days. It assumes the viewer is able to grasp Wells' intent and makes the right choice in not changing that intent.

Though, it might be a bit too character driven for the most die hard video game generation, the stylized action effects are usually enough to carry those with short attention spans through.

The music is a classical score like Star Wars an it supports the action at every turn.

The actors do a fine job and are very true to the spirit of Wells' characters. It was such a joy to see people that I have lived with in my imagination for many years take on human form and speak from the Victorian world. There is  a simultanious fantasy and gritty feel combined. The fight scene with the brother plays like larger than life action from an old pirate movie of the past while managing to feel like newsreel footage of an actual fight.

But beware, the focus is not the action. Wells' book emerges as the true star of this movie. Finally somebody has had the proper vision to bring the book to life. Hooray for H. G. WELLS' THE WAR O FTHE WORLDS.",1119657600,26,1588,4.399317406143345
2312389,4,B0009PW4D2,I viewed this movie after reading most of the reviews and I agree with the ones who said it is like a David Lynch movie. Like the Elephant Man. It also has a certain cinematic style very much like Fritz Lang's Metropolis. The film is a one of a kind as those movies are. The acting nails it and the effects are surreal. The music is amazing. I hope they are able to put out a soundtrack. An entertaining evening.,1119571200,30,412,4.1625
2312400,5,B0009PW4D2,We just watched this movie. It was strange and dark. It was like no movie we've ever seen. The mood in it is errie. It should be. It's the end of the world and the Martians have won. Humanity is all but lost. We really loved this film. If you want to try a different kind of movie. This is for you.,1119571200,32,298,3.8225806451612905
2312401,2,B0009PW4D2,"I've been a Wells fan and specifically a ""War of the Worlds"" fan since I got a vinyl copy of the Bell High-Camp Adventure version of the story for my eighth birthday. Since then, I've collected multiple versions of the story in book, audio and video formats. As bad as it is, from a film-making standpoint it's only worth two stars, this version will hold a special place in my collection for one reason. It is the first attempt to try and make a true Victorian era version of the novel.

Some parts of this film work rather well and should be noted. The opening of the film was well done using black and white archival footage and set the tone nicely. The scene where the narrator watches Mars with Ogilvy worked for me, also. I like how the dissertation of the first chapter was turned into a monologue by Oglivy and not voiced over by the narrator. It tended to flesh Ogilvy's character out just a bit. Most think Jack Clay over-acted here, but I thought he was dead on. He played Ogilvy as a pompous academician, just how I would have imagined him. I also felt the animation of the plume of gas coming from Mars in that scene had an almost Melles-esque feel like something out of ""Le Voyage dans la Lune"" - a sort of cartoony, fantasy feel.

I was pleased with the scene where the farmer tried to lock Ogilvy up in the shed. Granted, Wells only mentioned the incident in passing, but when you read the story, it conjured up a humorous scene that was fun to explore in a bit more depth.

I thought that Anthony Piana did a good job in a very tough role. He may act for many years to come and not get another role as dificult as this. Most of the narrator's references to himself in the novel are about what he was feeling or thinking while he was being made a refugee in his own land. Of course, he is not just a bystander, he interacts with many characters during his adventure and has some close scrapes with the martians, but on the whole, he is telling the story first person and internal motivations play an important part of the feel and pace of the story. Piana pulled the role off, but could have used a bit stronger direction in some scenes.

John Kaufmann was also very good in his role as the curate. The scenes with him and Piana in the destroyed house were very effective. He should have a long career as a character actor in films and television.

Now for some of the problems with the movie, which were mostly production-related. The special effects were very good in some places and absolutely bush-league in others. It was as if the crew looked at the first cut of the film and were afraid that there weren't enough effects. So, they went back and did proof-of-concept or storyboard animations for what they wanted to add, but didn't finish them and for whatever reason left them in.  Compositing was over-used and poorly done. The coloring of this film was inconsistent and quite a distraction.

This film was also too long. Not because there wasn't enough of a  story to make a three-hour movie, but because there wasn't enough well produced footage in this adaptation to make a good three hour movie. It's obvious that there was no real editing done on this film. Sadly, I could see enough good material to have made a very good 90-minute film here, by B-movie standards.  (Perhaps a fan edit like the one removing Jar-Jar from ""The Phantom Menace"" is on the horizon?)

I have watched this movie once all the way through. I haven't worked up the desire to put it in my player and watch it again, whole or in part. But, I probably will watch it again after I watch the Spielberg and Asylum Studios versions when they come out later this summer. Until then Pendragon Pictures version of ""H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds"" will sit in it's own very unique spot in my collection of all things WOTW.",1119571200,14,3818,4.418207681365576
2312402,1,B0009PW4D2,"I tried, I really tried...I really WANTED to like this film. I am a total fan of Wells, and of this particular book. I was excited to hear that someone had taken on the challenge of making a faithfull movie adaptation set prior to the turn of the century as in the book. However, the effects were soooo bad. The acting was soooo bad. The music was soooo bad. The editing was soooo bad. Unfortunately, all of the above were soooo bad that I was totally distracted from being able to enjoy anything about this film. And here, I'll be absolutely honest...it was all so bad that I couldn't watch the whole thing. I had to turn it off. It was too much to bear. Don't get me wrong. I wasn't expecting top-notch effects or big name actors. (Actually, Tom Cruise in the upcoming Spielberg film is a total turn-off to me). But it was so terribly bad even when I had low expectations that it was a total dissapointment. How can garbage like this get released? Well, of course, only on DVD. The plans for a theatrical release were dumped. The only thing good about this version was that the storyline was almost totally faithful to Well's book. I just wish Hines had more respect for the author than to make this dreck. Don't waste your time, unless you want to just have a good laugh at Well's expense. I just recently watched ""The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers""...both versions, and I have to say, the 50's version was at a par 10 times above what this movie was. A total dissapointment. Sad.",1119571200,15,1484,4.41970802919708
2312403,1,B0009PW4D2,"I love ""The War of the Worlds"". I have multiple copies of the book on my shelf. Books with critical analysis. Books on tape. Books on CD. George Pal's interpretation on VHS. Orson Welles interpretation on CD. I have it on my PDA. I've read the novel at least 3 times just this year.

So, when I heard that someone was finally doing a period version set in turn of the Century england, I waited.

I'm still waiting. This is absolutely the most inept piece of filmmaking I've ever seen. ""Catman"", ""Manos the Hands of Fate"", ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", ""Battlefield Earth"", heck, even the sci-fi channel's ""Mansquito"" is better than this piece of filth. The acting is bad. The effects are unfinished. The direction is amateur. The editing is almost non-existant. The cinematography is cut rate. I can find nothing good to say about this film. Heck, even the CD case had an odd smell to it when it arrived in the mail.

If we could harness the energy of H.G.Wells spinning in his grave we could make a better film than this. With a few thousand dollars, a big box of Lego and a digital camera *I* could make a better film than this. Don't waste your money on this. If I had pirated this film off the Internet I would feel I wasted my bandwidth and disk space.",1119571200,17,1254,4.396551724137931
2312404,5,B0009PW4D2,"This version of the H. G. Wells book THE WAR OF THE WORLDS takes place in the period the book was set in 1900. It is true to the book and makes the right choice by focusing on the story and the characters.

The film makes clever use of it's low budget as Masterpiece Theater does. The filmmakers are good at drawing your focus from anacronisms and they do a similar good job at masking the seems. But if that's all your looking at, you are in trouble from the start. Because this movie is about the relationships of the characters and their attempts at dealing with a world gone mad.

There are so many human moments of true depth I don't know where to begin. The narrator's joy at seeing Mars through a telescope for the first time. He's childlike in his enthusiasm and plays nicely against the astronomer Ogilvy's old owl wisdom.

The movie also effortlessly shifts from character to character as it does in the book, while always maintains a cohesive structure.

The wife come across as wise but trapped in the ""guilded cage"" of the times. She struggles to wear her position in life as a woman deferring to her husband's wishes, even as her better judgement tells her that to do so will put her in danger. Susan Goforth delivers a soft, yet strong character, such as was expected of women. Be feminine, wear a corset, be a lady, do the washing and a day of hard labor. Do it as if you were a little bird.

Ogilvy, the astronomer is the original scientist arguing for reason over fear. Some of the fun of the storytelling comes from the present knowledge that we have that the meteorite with ""men inside"" is not what it seems. The actor Jack Clay plays this straightforward. In one scene he is frightened for the men trapped inside the meteor and the music has tragic qualities as we know he should be running away.

Henderson, the reporter is played with energy and wonderment. He's out of his legue as Ogilvy brings him to the meteor. There are great moments when Henderson first sees this huge molten rock at the bottom of a crater and constantly checks in with glances to Ogilvy as to whether or not he should run.

There lies the irony. And it build throughout the movie. We are constantly shown innocence as it meets the discovery of truth and then falls away. For some of the characters, their very soul falls away with this loss of innocence.

The narrator, being a writer, is able, at first, to keep a perspective, if not a distance from that which he encounters. But as the Martians unfold their plan for conquering the world, he is slowly pulled in more and more on a personal level.

Finally his being is tested to the fullest as he faces the possible loss of his wife. Anthony Piana does a superb job displaying this innocence and then progresses the character nicely as his repeated horrors and mistakes grow him and show him what is really true.

Severel times in the film, with the best of intentions, he accidentally causes the deaths of people. At one point he gets the idea that people will be safe from the Martian heat ray if they all dive into the water. The results are tragic as they are boild to death. By luck or fate he survives.

And this happens often. Just as in life, sometimes the wrong choice saves him, sometimes the right choice puts him in harm's way.

One of the people the narrator encounters and travels with is an Artillery man, dryly played by the strapping James Lathrop. Lathrop skillfully captures the fractured soul of a soldier shocked loose from the realities of the world by the horrors of a war. A war like no Victorian has ever seen. He plays the character straight arrow, as if he has no awareness of his detachment that alternates with a need to silently weep.

He is in great contrast to the curate performed by John Kaufmann. Kaufmann bears an uncanny resemblence to Ron Howard. When we meet his charracter, his spirit is so broken that he has reverted to a child-like state.

The narrator is saddled with taking care of him and constantly worries that this poor soul is going to cause the death of them both. This builds over time and comes to a peak as the two are trapped for days in the pantry of a collapsed house. The curate increasingly rants louder and louder, ultimately drawing the Martians to them.

The story goes back and forth between the narrator and his borther, both cleverly played Anthony Piana. The brother is a sharp contrast to the innocence of the narrator. From the get go he is all business and focus. A trained fighter he takes on a group of men in a particularly realistic fight scene to save two women from the villians' clutches. He winds up travelling with the women as their protector.

The most famous aspect of the book is the 100 foot tall Martian fighting machines and these are cleverly rendered in CGI and with puppeted models. They have a scary presence and a calculation in their movements.

The battle scenes are tragic and played fully in this direction. The effects are sometimes low budgety but support the story and seen through the character's eyes, quite frightening.

There are many small character touches. When the brother declares that he is an excellent shot, but you can se in his eyes that he is not. When the young girl with Shirley Temple hair has to fire a pistol but has no idea how to handle the kick. When the curate knocks over a bottle and slyly steals the narrator's portion. When the wife tries to convince the narrator not to leave her and she thinks she has succeeded only to feel him pull away. The transition of shock and sadness is a great moment of acting. When the narrator discovers a young lady who has commited suicide. He reaches out to touch her check, to find connection with her, but finding her cold, recoils in horror. When the narrator is informed that the town his wife was in was completely destroyed, his sorrow is so true it is almost to much to watch. As if you stumbled in on a private moment and want to back out.

For some viewers, moments such as these may make them uncomfortable, but they are raw and true in a MIKE LEE kind of way.

This movie feels completly true throughout its running time from an emotional performance perspective. In style, the movie is surreal, like pre WW2 German cinema that spawned films such as Metropolis.

Occaisonally the style is so surreal that I was reminded of early David Lynch with his films like the Elepahnt Man or Eraser Head. But the people are real and the tale unfolds. through them.

To view this movie solely on the sum of its parts is to miss what it is. To break it down into its elements and then study the elements is like studying the pigments of the Mona Lisa or marble compound of the statue of David without looking at the art these elements make up.

Undoubtedly, some will only see the parts. But H. G. WELLS' WAR OF THE WORLDS is much much more than the sum of its parts. It is the transformation of souls in uncertain times. And the telling of the story is executed with mastery.",1119571200,33,6983,4.468185388845248

This movie adaptation of one of Wells' most popular novels is entertaining with a certain childlike magic and Sleepy Hollow-like kind of imagination that transports you to a world different from our own.

2312407,2,B0009PW4D2,"I'd followed the progress of  Pendragon Pictures'  ""H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds"" on the web for a considerable time. I was initially thrilled to learn that, finally, an authentic period version of Wells' classic novel was being filmed, and from all initial appearances it looked like the real deal. I really was looking forward to seeing this movie.

And now that I have, I have to express how disappointed I am with it, and how misled I was by Pendragon's website, their trailer, their rhetoric, and their production stills. I feel I've got to be brutally honest and let the potential buyer be aware of what they're going to get.

First, the packaging and price should be a clue; it's packaged along the lines of many ""bargain"" DVDs and wasn't even submitted for an MPAA rating, meaning this was not released theatrically nor likely was going to be (despite their claims). Even the ""DVD"" logo is a poor imitation of the real thing.

And as to the film itself- despite its good intentions, it is a truly amateurish, uneven, poorly filmed, paced, and edited production that has a good script but winds up laid low by the quality, terrible pacing, variable acting, and low budget of the film.

The SPFX in this film are all done with amateurish CGI- and unfortunately, this includes everything- pyrotechnics, Martian tripods, cityscapes, blown up buildings, squashed people, dead bodies, even horses and carts. I can't stress strongly enough that the renderings and effects are very primitive and very poorly composited onto filmed footage. There is no color matching with the live action stock and absolutely no level of photorealism at all. A number of sets and surroundings turn out to be simply fakes with the actors matted in using bluescreen and with really obvious video matte lines. Every special effect sequence resembles, at best, a rough ""animatic"" used to visualize a movie before a final effect rendering. Trouble is, these ARE the final renderings.

The animal budget must have been non-existent. Many close-up scenes, supposedly with horse-drawn carts and carriages, never show a horse (and the reins are clearly glued to the front of the cart), and have terribly jerky matted-in backgrounds when they're ""moving"". Long shots of the same ""horse and carriage"" reveal them rendered as CGI models, but so poorly composited that the horse's legs are moving at a brisk trot but the entire vehicle pokes along at a terribly slow and laughable pace as if the horse was running along on ice. This also happens in several cases with badly done CGI troops in a long shot of a battlefield, where the soldiers' legs move briskly but they stand essentially in place. Real horses appear when ridden by soldiers, and a Shetland Pony makes an appearance (and is given a screen credit too) but otherwise animals are absent.

People are hit with the Martian heat-ray, and burst into overlaid CGI ""flame""- note that their clothes don't burn and their hair isn't singed- and there's not a tree, blade of grass, or anything else around them that winds up being scorched. They then suddenly turn into skeletons, which are very shiny and continue to twitch, scream, flail and jerk without a scrap of flesh on them.

Truly the worst effects appear during the ""Thunder Child"" sequence, which was a visual disappointment - a very poor, animatic-like ""warship"" that has no visible crew and looks like a student 3D modeling project,  matted over footage of real water not matched to the CGI ""wake"" and other scene elements. This sequence (as well as the ""Martians Feeding"" scene) strays from the novel with a few ""creative license"" elements.

The battle sequences were also disappointing; the three or four live actors doubling as ""soldiers"" (with recycled footage in several instances) wear fake uniforms made up of pieces of surplus modern-day US Marines dress greens, and anachronistic fore-and-aft hats, elements neither historically accurate for 1898 nor convincingly British. And to top it off, they carry clearly recognizable modern-day BB-guns that bear no resemblance to British rifles of the period. Only the pistols come close to being correct for the period. And a later scene even features a modern Mossberg shotgun. The cannons never recoil when ""fired"" (all muzzle flashes and pyrotechnics are added with computer graphics), and all this just adds to the overall cheap, ""home movie"" look of this film. A lot of computer-generated ""haze"" and ""smoke"" is overlaid to obscure the really poor quality of much of the live shots.  And speaking of anachronism, there are several instances where footage of modern diesel engines and 1930's locomotives (American yet) are used to represent trains of the period... which then don't match the effects. You'll also see familiar modern Grolsch beer bottles used extensively just because of their unique cap.

Having said all that, there are several positive elements in the film's favor. The tripods are a spiffy design and the heat-ray generator follows Wells' description. The movie's surprisingly decent script is really very faithful to the book and includes all the events and elements long missing from previous incarnations of Wells' story. They get the sequences right and in many cases, ""the book is the script.""

And if decent money, talent, direction, and special effects- and actors other than family and friends (the lead actor and actress also wrote, directed, produced, etc)- had been put behind this movie- and it had been decently edited- it might have truly been worthwhile.

However, the execution of the story just can't get past the low-budget production values and other dreadful problems.

2312409,4,B0009PW4D2,"Viewers expecting to see a Hollywood style epic will be disappointed. Tom Cruise will not appear to defeat the invaders single handedly, nor will he romance the screen siren of the month. This movie is a faithful adaptation of a Victorian novel, and, as such, maintains a quaint old-fashioned air which I found charming. There is no ultra graphic violence, no throbbing sex scences, no foul language: instead we are presented an old-fashioned, almost Victorian, approach to filmmaking which successfully brought the viewer back into the times the film purports to portray. This is somewhat akin to remaking a 1920s style film in black and white. This approach is refreshing, given the steady stream of vulgar, formulaic offal coming out of Hollywood today.

I found the tale riveting. I was drawn into the plot and the plight of the very real characters. The narrator had a limited view of the totality of the war against the martians and that is what we were shown. The special effects were not Lucas quality, but they somehow fit in with the overall antiquity of the presentation. They demanded a little more imagination from the viewer (suspension of disbelief) than is normally expected these days. There were no identifiable actors in the film and this too helped draw me into the action. I was not forced to overlook that I was viewing the very familar Leo DiCaprio, for example, rather I saw the actors as believable people, caught up in an extraordinary nightmare. I think many films would be far more riveting if ""stars"" were not obscuring the dramatic firmament.

2312421,3,B0009PW4D2,"I'm given this film a hand for attempting an enormous movie as a complete independent and making it to the finish line.

This film is a fantasy art flim. It's an odyssey of a man caught up in the devastating tragedy of war. Only this time the enemy is extraterrestrials who outpower the human race from the beginning.

The first act sets up the appearance of the Martians, disguised in a trojan meteorite, and their deployment.

The second act is the main character, the no-named ""writer"", discovering that the Martians are both dominating and unstoppable.

The third and final act is the main character hiding and surviving the holocaust that is being enforced by the Martians.

The chronicle of the collapse of civil society and the demise of hope and faith are interestingly presented. The emotional wattage between the characters is satisfying ninety percent of the time. The other ten it is either too reserved or too much. The colored filter sepia toned photography is sometimes stunning, sometimes baffling, and overall is beneficial to the film for looking unique.

This film has a quasi-poetic, lyrical tone that is flawed by poor, low-budget special effects.

And I did, but for all the wrong reasons. At times it was hilariously funny, but obviouslly not purpose. The acting was bad, very bad. Mr Piana was the best actor by far. At times he was great and very likeable. And at other times, (playing the narrators brother),as hammy as a bag of pork scratchings.

However, the guy who played the Artilleryman was dire, dire, dire,dire etc... What kind of a quasi accent was it supposed to be? Sounded like Stephen Hawkins whispering through a microphone at a Nine Inch Nails gig.

The special effects at times were terrible, and at others pretty ok. The scene from the ruined house is actualy very good, and I think this film would of benefited from relying upon suspense more than effects.

Editing was sloppy. Like a scrapbook of scenes/images. The scene from Weybridge actually made me feel really narked off, as it was completly bodged up. The soundtrack was ok to be honest. Stiring in parts. Don't get me started on the Thunderchild because it WAS VERY VERY POOR INDEED.

True to the book

According to one review ON AMAZON  it stopped someone becoming a lesbian (WHAT????)

Lots of time to get up to get a beer during the walking around aimlessly scenes (there is actually over half an hour of pointless walking around in the film, gfriend timed it)

The false moustache did make it thru the film, though there were a few dodgy moments about half way thru (it was actually fully detached from the face on one side at one point)

Probably the most disapointing thing was the fighting machine thunderchild battle....... BAD., though the actors showed very deep emotions in this section (I believe due to the fact they had recently turned down some more lucrative parts in hair spray adverts)

Mr Bachman (Steven King) wrote a short story called the long walk I think mr hines would be the perfect man to produce this.",1119398400,11,1328,4.411522633744856

I have been following the production of the Tim Hines film via the net and was really looking forward to its March release but was surprised at the lack of advertising, so actually sent them an email suggesting it was all a hoax.  Having now seen the movie, I reluctantly have to say I wish it was a hoax!

Had this film been made back in the 1940's it may have been better received, but when you consider that movies such a Forbidden Planet could have been made back in the 1950's, this is quite simply an appalling waste of resources and time.  I wouldn't like to hazard a guess at the budget available, but erecting a few houses for the homeless would have been more rewarding and noteworthy.

I considered I had a fairly high boredom threshold, but the endless scenes of people running about the countryside, the perpetual cuts from pained facial expression, to bad special effect, then back to pained facial expression, to bad special effect.  Even my 11 year old who can watch Jumanji several times in one day, began sighing.

I fully recognise that the 'good' reviews are simply there to add balance and generate at least some return for the investor (yes singular). However, I sincerely hope this doesn't just sink out of sight as it deserves some recognition for just how bad it is.",1119398400,14,1451,4.532567049808429
2312426,1,B0009PW4D2,"Having seen its trailer on the Pendragon website, I knew the film wasn't any good before I bought it. Most filmmakers would have tried to conceal just how awful this film was, perhaps by only running ""teaser"" previews which would rave about how great the movie was while never making the mistake of showing any actual footage, but not Pendragon. By putting the insanely cheap ""Fall of Big Ben"" scene - not to mention the equally hilarious ""Here Comes the Glowing Green Cartoon Meteor Straight From PBS's BooBah Show"" bit - right there in the preview, the filmmakers left no doubt of just how low the film's quality was going to be, and for that I salute them. It's refreshing to see such clueless honesty in marketing nowadays.

The problem is this: although the preview is very, very funny, the film itself runs far too long to continue laughing at it. Oh sure, the first five minutes or so, in which the lead character lets his heavy eyeliner and fake mustache do all his acting for him, well, that's pure comedy gold. But after an hour and a half of the performing mustache and eyeliner routine, that gold starts to tarnish pretty badly. And when you realize there's still ANOTHER hour and a half left to go, well, that's when you completely lose all faith in humanity and start dressing up like a huge cockroach, in hopes that when they finally assume their rightful place as the ultimate rulers of the Earth, they'll at least let you hang around and fetch moldy donuts for them and things.

In the meantime, however, you've got to find a practical use for this DVD. Here are some things you can try:

Chew on it. Puppies love chewing on shiny, plastic things like DVDs, and puppies always look happy. Maybe chewing on this DVD will make you happy too. Just don't crunch it up and swallow it. That will not make you happy. And the proctologist who will have to help you sort things out afterwards will not be happy AT ALL.

Talk to it. Talking to plants can help them grow into bigger, healthier plants. Maybe talking to this DVD will help it grow into a real, less-stupid movie. You will have to say just the right things though, like ""Hey, Mr. Wal-Mart employee, take this back and give me a copy of anything else instead, even 'Racing Stripes' or 'Pauly Shore Is Dead.'""

Take it out dancing. Yes, you will look extremely silly trying to dance with a DVD, and you will get thrown out and banned from many, many clubs, but at least you won't be at home, where this film might accidentally find its way into your DVD player and start running again. It's worth any humiliation to avoid that grim possibility.

Stomp on it. This is the most satisfying thing to do. But don't just run up and do it. First sidle up to the DVD. Walk around it casually. Then lightly shuffle around it doing an energetic Mexican Hat Dance. And then, when it least expects it, LEAP DOWN UPON IT AND BRUTALLY CRUSH IT INTO A THOUSAND MILLION GLEAMING SPLINTERS OF SPARKLING PLASTIC GARBAGE. Now you feel great! Unless you weren't wearing any shoes, and now maybe you feel like you need a doctor. Well, just don't mention my name when you start filling out those vast piles of emergency room forms. Whatever strange things you choose to do in your own home are no concern of mine.",1119398400,,3259,4.505922165820643
2312427,4,B0009PW4D2,"I've seen rumors that all of the one star reviews here are actually paid operatives from Paramount slamming this independent production in the lead up to their own updated version ... hmmm ... Well here is a fascinating observation:  I noticed earlier tonight that when this DVD actually slipped into the top 100 list there was an immediate rash of attacks against this production as ""the worst film of all time"" - now that is quite a title to try to live up to, but I'm sorry, this film just isn't up to it.

Yes, it is defiantly an independent art film and a fascinating work. Some of the CGI are a little off, but most of it is really good. As far as any complaints that they are cartoonish, well I agree, they are - but I like them that way.  Think of the cartoon-like filming in Kill Bill, The Incredible Hulk, Tank Girl, and Sin City; true this film is not on budget par with those, and under scrutiny you can see that, but cartoon CGI actually adds to the different and interesting feel of this work.  Both the writer and the curate are dead on in their rolls, and with a running time of 3 hours this film is still amazingly easy to watch.

I know for one I'm tired of seeing Tom Cruise begging for media attention ""Look at me! Hey, look at me - I've got a BIG movie coming out!"" and I don't doubt for a second that there is not a 100 or so Paramount exec's trying to figure out ways to make you not buy this film ... and posting here is sure an easy thing to do - they even say ""don't buy it"" in their posts! Geez! -- Good thing they make themselves so blatantly obvious.

For a more balanced review, do a net search for Rex the Strange; he posted one recently that is interesting, funny, and balanced - but beware he really lays it all out - lots of spoilers. At the end of the day, this is simply a very very good independent film that has undertaken the monumental task of filming the entire story of The War of the Worlds ... if you are interested in the story enough to read through all these threads, then you will absolutely enjoy this film.",1119398400,29,2056,4.179292929292929

In the end I'd have to say it was a bit of both. I loved it for its characters, story, filming and martians. I hated that they didn't have a bigger budget. This film is an instant classic that will be quoted over and over again. While it wasn't Hollywood, it did what it was trying to do.",1119312000,28,634,4.204918032786885
2312429,5,B0009PW4D2,"H. G. WELLS' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is a three hour epic that recreates H. G. Wells' classic tale of the dichotomy of arrogance vs complacency in a keenly wrought script by Timothy Hines and Susan Goforth. For all its length it never loses the narrative of the book  to become a special effects ride.

The sets, costumes, cannons and other period detail are carefully created. This film, produced by Pendragon Pictures, was in production  for several years before Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg jumped in to do their own modern day remake of the 1953 George Pal film of the same name. This movie is not a remake. It is an accurate recreation of the book and much soul has been put into it. You can see that the film's director, Timothy Hines really cares about this material and has given it his all within the lower budget constraints. The seams show in the special effects from time time but fit the unique movie. This 3 hour movie proves its mettle when viewed non-stop.

Director Hines wisely emphasizes the issues directly from the novel, including the of emerging women's  equality. This is subtle and there are tensions between the narrator and the wife over her rights. But this is not overt, or out of time with the period. Nor does Hines opt to dump the story and focus on the wierd aliens and their strange war machines. The Martians serve the story and Hines stays on track.

At first the humans think the Martians are no match for the superior British war machines of 1900. The main character (the narrator) leaves his wife in the safety of cousins so he can go back and witness the conquering of the Martians.

Very quickly the tide is turned and it is humans on the run. With the discovery that there is no safe place to be under the supreme power of the invaders, the narrator decides (is compelled) to return to his wife. The bulk of the rest of the story focuses on the narrator's monumental journey to find his wife and the characters he meets along the way. All the while the Martians are slowly, casually securing the planet.

There is an interwoven story of the narrator's brother played byt the same actor, Anthony Piana as he tries to help two sisters in law (played by Darlene Renee Sellers and Jamie Lynn Sease), to safety.

With tremendous veracity we see the narrator's motivation to overcome the war and death around him while hanging onto his sanity.

The Martians are not the usual attacking creatures, but have intelect, as is displayed in one scene where the tentacle of a Martian machine closes a door behind which the narrator is hiding. It's a solidly creepy moment.

The narrator displays a tender soul, at first hungry for adventure, as the wife proclaims. But as the empire of man passes away, the narrator is stripped clean of all pretentions and discover what truly matters, love, family, tenderness.

The story and its conclusion which are known to just about everyone is well crafted. There is a moment when the narrator offers himself up to the Martain machnes, unable to go on anymore. This scene is so delicately played, so utterly profound, that it shows the wisdom of giving over to a higher power.

There are many powerful messages, not the least of which when the curate, trapped in the debris of an exploded house, expounds on humanity's hypocricy. The message is that man must take responsibility for his actions and stop ignoring the emotional needs of others. Complacency leads to destruction.

The actors are excellent. The period detail is elegant, and the special effects are coloful, albeit sometimes revealing. Hines has a hard time making crowd scenes credible, but they work with little distraction from the story.

The film manages to be true to the reasons H. G. Wells wrote this book, a book that is among the most famous ever written. This ""The War of the Worlds"" is the first to do any Wells story so verbatum to the source material, ever. I look forward to sharing it with others.",1119312000,39,3947,4.642754662840746
2312440,1,B0009PW4D2,"Oh where to begin... alright, a little background:  this book was the very first full-length novel that I read and that was about 33 years ago at the age of 5 and I remember everything vividly because I read that book time and time again.

Now for this movie:

There is a basic following of the book except there seemed to be no production values.  The compositing was so terrible that I could tell every single seperate element of each poorly filmed scene.  The ships in the Thunderchild scene were some of the poorest 3D models that I have ever seen and the compositing of the 3D models and the other scene elements were so horrible that I will use this film in my 3D animation class as an example of how NOT to do 3D special effects.

With special effects being at the level that they are today there is no excuse for the absolute bottom-of-the-barrel effects that are in this movie.

Now for the acting:

Terrible.  That's all that can be said.  1st year acting students do a better job.

In every respect and in every way this movie is horrible.  Do NOT buy this movie unless you plan on following my example and showing this movie as an example of horrible acting, cinematography, special effects, and even costumes (witness the worst fake mustache that I have ever seen) and maybe having a contest to see who can find the most mistakes in each scene.",1119312000,14,1357,4.449392712550607
2312441,4,B0009PW4D2,"I  saw this movie and enjoyed it. It's a dramatic story of love, courage, and how one man faces unsurmountable odds and pulls through.

The story follows the 1898 book it is based on almost scene for scene.  It begins with the first line of the book and ends with almost the last line. A few things have been changed around but it makes sense.

The story is very well told. When a meteor lands near an English country town, the locals have excitment at what might be inside. They get more than they bargain for. The end of the world at the hands of Martian invaders.

The main character, the Writer/Narrator transforms from a casual, almost aloof man of leisure to a hardened, kean survivor using all his strength to keep his heart intact. There's crucial comedy relief by John Kaufmann as the Curate. It is an epic scale movie that takes 3 hours to tell. A brave effort.",1119312000,29,871,4.41875

Only the composer seems to know his job, everyone else is very bad at theirs. But there are a few moments that aren't so bad and maybe it would have been better shorter. Weirdest thing is how much ordinary stuff like doors and animals is computer effects. This is just stupid. The real thing would be cheaper and look better. This just wastes money that should have been spent on the very bad Martian machine effects. But it was just about watchable enough for me to finish it. And as an amateur picture on a Blair Witch budget or less I guess I have to give them some credit for enthusiasm. Just don't take that as a reason to buy it.

Most people know the story, have read the book or seen the 50's movie. But like the new Star Wars knowing what is going to happen is half the fun. And the director Timthy Hines knows that we know this and  plays on it. We are often watching the characters from a step removed as they blunder like children about their new discovery: a meteorite that has landed in a wooded area known as Horsell Common. WE know wha is about to happen, but the character's DON'T know what is about to happen. It works splendidly.

But knowing what's coming does not allow you to settle back down into your seat. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I still was able to go along for the ride.

The film is crafted with much attention to the characters and the story and it holds us.  It is not like they had to shell out the big bucks they did not have.

The movie is unique. And there is not a lot of unique pictures out there. It will be very interesting to see Hollywood's upcoming take on this materiel. this version is a decent soul searching horror flick.

The sign of a masterpiece.

I agree with many of the positive comments on this film. The story, acting and execution are immaculate. The gentle build up is so deceptively simple that the filmmakers fully exploit this. And the film excels supremely on so many levels. There is a constant ambiguity or the world around the principal charachters as the Martains quickly crush the humans and dominate the Earth.

There is one scene in which a preacher who has had a nervous breakdown huddles himself in a little heap and declairs ""they are all around us.""  Much of the movie has this feel. An uneasy where do we turn kind of feel. Even after the second viewing, as the first night, the images of this movie were stuck in my head. Vivid colors, strange suction sounds for the Martian fighting walkers, tenticles reaching into the crushed house from the dark.

Wells may have had his prejudices and his hypocrisies, but he doesn't deserve to see his masterpiece trashed like this. Neither do you. If you must spent $10.49, give it to famine relief.",1119312000,13,1314,4.682608695652174
2312477,5,B0009PW4D2,"This film is pretty darn enjoyable, even if its made on a small budget. And anyone who's ever appreciated H. G. Wells' writings, (not just seen films based on his books), with get a kick out of it. Latest comer to the world of Wells is Timothy Hines, who introduces the filmgoing world to a look back, world of yester-year where we follow a Victorian man's journey to survive the unsurvivable while keeping his head.

Congratulations for keeping the movie faithful to the original story.

Even though the aliens are a bit too cartoonish, I startled when they first looked at me. The aliens become much more of a spooky presence once they're destroyed the Victorian towns. They hang out in their cool super tall walking machines and the walking machines take on a life of their own. The walking machines are cool because you can tell that someone or something in this case, is piloting the thing.

The characters themselves are surprisingly well-shaped. They argument between the writer (the lead man) and his wife, oh boy, I've lived that before. Ha, ha, ha. The soldier is very real and when he loses touch with relality late on I was like, no way man! Dude, you're a trained soldier! Keep it together. But what can you do, that's how Wells wrote him. The Elphinstone ladies, beautiful while their wealth and dignity gets stripped away, are surprisingly well played. Though different than I had original read them, I understood their reservedness, then, ultimate breakdown. Most fun: the curate guy. He made me laugh. And when the writer decks him in the collapsed place, oh boy, I had a few slugs ready to give him just so he'd shut up!

There are some points where we must suspend our disbelief by the thinnest of threads. Mildly put, no awards for special effects here! The CGI is passable, more surreal and errie than anything else, and the Thunderchild scenes are bleck, so don't expect much there. Though these scenes only run about two minutes of the three hour movie, and are saved by a strange and eerie flying machine at the end. However, there are several cool scenes, the arm grabbing the curate and killing him, the walking machine falling in the water and killing the people in the river, the people munched at the pit, and lots of good scenes.

Overall, I really liked it. It's a weird little film and I enjoyed it. I'll probably re-read the book then watch it again. Still looking forward to the big-budget redo next week, but for this film, and especially Wells fans, I'd say we've finally been given one worth seeing.",1119312000,39,2536,4.6644295302013425

This is more of a spiritual journey, like `Catwoman' or `Battlefield Earth' that shows you a whole new way of looking at the world and telling a story. Everything about this film is intentional: the deliberate pace that, in the extended walking scenes, leads you into an almost Zen-like state of mind-emptying unconsciousness that reveals the true shape of the galaxy, the deliberately stilted performances mirrored in the jerky lo-res video look of the film, the Pac-Man special effects that turn war into a male-dominated video game so its human consequences can be ignored. Even the decision to set the film in an America where the 14th Century city of London is its capital and Waterloo Station is an outhouse shed is a clear attempt to show a world turned upside down. It's like David Lynch meets David Lean, an epic journey like `Lifeforce' only without the naked zombies.

------

Well... we finally finished watching Pendragon's ""War Of the Worlds"" and both Diana (my girlfriend) and I decided to give the film these ratings:

Diana: 2.5 out of 5

Maximillian: 2.5 out of 5

Diana also added that if I loved her I should never make her watch that film again! LOL

------

CONs:-
The film was WAY too long!
- They could have easily edited out an hour to an hour and a half of the film and had a better product...
- The pointless ""running through the woods"" scenes were pretty tiring...
- The use of colored camera lenses made for a very quick progression of time: night, day, night, day, etc. ...sometimes it seemed as if day and night switched every couple of minutes...
- The annoying opera singer was simply terrible!
- The music lulled me to sleep on several occasions...
- Some of the film's dialogue seems as if it was taken from the book VERBATIM... this made for some awkward dialogue in spots...
- The blue screen filming was often PAINFULLY obvious...
- Many of the actors played two or more roles in the film...
- The acting quality on the film wasn't always very high... for example:

The big ""Thunder Childe"" scene (Martian Tripods versus a pre-WWI naval dreadnought) was like watching a tennis match:

- Pan to characters' faces with incredulous looks...
- Pan to CGI special effect's clip...
- Pan to characters' faces with incredulous looks...
- Pan to CGI special effect's clip...
- Pan to characters' faces with incredulous looks...
- Pan to CGI special effect's clip...
- On and on, etc., etc.

That ""CGI to actors back and forth"" sequence characterizes much of the film.

------

PROs:
- More accurate to the original H.G. Wells novel than any other WOTW film...
- In fact, at times, it seems as if the film EXACTLY mirrors the book's chapters...
- Interesting visualizations of the Martians!
- Cool retro special effects that were pitiful at times but very nostalgic of early sci-fi pulp novels and films...
- The damned preacher always had his mouth stuffed full of bread! He was just as annoying as the book seemed to intend him to be!
- The annoying opera singer who was simply terrible got eaten!
- The period clothing and hair styles were oustanding... Love the curls!!!
- They remembered to feature the Martian ""black smoke,"" but it seemed to be very sparsely featured (I seem to recall that ""black smoke"" was what defeated the British navy at the Battle Of the Thames... not in the film... ).
- They actually remembered to feature the elusive Martian flyers!

------

OVERVIEW:
I can't recommend this film for entertainment value, but the alien visualizations are great. Only a very serious fan of WOTW would like this film. The average Joe will probably be bored to sleep... and maybe a few serious WOTW fans as well... I plan to look at paused stills of my favorite special effects and even a few of my favorite scenes, BUT... I will never ever watch the entire film in a single sitting again!

I do not recommend Pendragon's ""War Of the Worlds"" film.

2312493,2,B0009PW4D2,"The one scene that sums it up for me is the ferry crossing, in which, if you look, you'll see the ferry sailing *sideways*. That right there sums this picture up for me.

By the third walking scene, I found myself giggling as I said aloud to my housemate (in my worst English accent), ""Oh, it's so grand to be an Englishman walking in the countryside! Bloody, bloody grand to walk! Walking, walking, walking -- there's nothing like it!"" and so on throughout any and all of the sequences.

But other bizarre things abound: the incomprehensible lunch scene between the Author, his wife, and the maid, in which it appears he's leering at the maid in front of his wife. The interminable fight scene between the Brother and one of the ruffians (who, in a previous shot, was seen running quickly, quickly in the other direction). A visible bike rack in the London scene where the Brother steals a bike.

2312494,3,B0009PW4D2,"My recent purchase of the direct to DVD edition of H.G. Wells ""The War of the Worlds"" was made despite the many glaring BAD reviews this film received, even before its public release on June 14, 2005.  The purchase was made because I had been tracking the history of this film since I stumbled upon Pendragon's website late last year.  I viewed the film with a great deal of skepticism, and a very critical eye, and I hope that this review will serve readers with a balanced view of what one person thought of the film.

To begin, the film follows the original novel more closely than any movie based on a Well's novel has ever done.  Much of the dialogue, settings, scenes, even small details are lifted from the original subject matter, and for that alone, Timothy Hines deserves a great deal of credit.  In addition, Hines' film comes in the advent of the collosal Paramount release expected later this year, and with the amount of controversy surrounding the legalities of this small independent film's release, it is a pleasure to have an adaptation of the story that actually adheres to Well's original novel.

For fans of the original book, keep in mind that this film does depict the story accurately, and gives audiences a glimpse at the story as Well's originally envisioned it.  With that said, the balance of my comments are going to be directed at the film itself.

The most glaring flaw with this film is, I am truly sorry to say, in how it was filmed.  As other reviews have indicated, this film was obviously shot before a bluescreen, with the understanding that effects could be added later.  Never is this more appearant than when viewing the several sequences when the characters are travelling either by horse-drawn carriage, or by boat (as depicted in the Thunderchild scene).  The matting is very poorly done and is very distracting when viewing the film.  In addition, many of the ""sets"" are nothing more than CGI rendered images that look cartoonish, or at best, not fully rendered. Actors are placed in the foreground in almost all cases, and the CGI world they are supposed to be integrated into looks obviously animated, which is a tragic shame, considering that so many of these images could have been shot using live action sets.

Expanding on my comments about the CGI, I must also take fault with about 75% of the effects shots in this film.  To give credit where it is due, some of the sequences containing the walking machines are decent, though still-substandard to the level of effects seen in most films today.  There are points in the film where the effects are so poorly done, it is difficult to even determine what it is that we are supposed to be looking at-I.E., the sequence when the invaders are consuming an animal (presumably a cow??).  The effects do detract from the movie to such an extent that it can, at times, make the film difficult to watch with any credulity...and this is a shame, because so much effort was made to getting the story right.

As for the acting...a number of comments have been made in other reviews about the quality of the performances being notably lacking.  I cannot wholly disagree with that statement, though I do give credit to the performance of the narrator, who seems to hold the story together, especially in the latter sequences of the film when he and the Curate are caught up in the demolished house.  His performance is generally pretty good. The Artilleryman too, is decent in his role, though he is only present for a small portion of the story.  Given the conditions in which this film was filmed-the lack of any real sets and the large level of blue-screening appearantly used, the characters reactions to situations and experiences are believable and generally well articulated.

The most gaping hole in this film is the Thunderchild scene.  Although up to this point there are many effects sequences that are forgivable (though laughable), this sequence was horrendous.  Having never read the original novel, I had no idea that this sequences was one of the climactic moments of the story, and this film certainly does nothing to encourage that belief.  This sequence, more so than any other part of the film, is completely horrendous to watch and very poorly developed.

As it is, the film does leave a lot to be desired, and for non-fans of the book, this film is probably not for you.  It is a shame, really, that it did not have the funding of a major studio production, because the film has the potential to be quite good.  As it is, I am giving it a three-star rating because it tries to bring to life one of the great science fiction stories of all time without the interference of a Hollywood re-write.  Hines's film will not be remembered in the annals of filmmaking as a great work, but it is a faithful adaptation of a story which has stood the test of time for more than 100 years.

For fans of the novel, approach this with the acute understanding that what you are going to view is not an effects-driven movie.  If you are looking for a high-tech effects film, wait until the release of the Cruise/Spielberg adaptation due out later this month.  This film is one for those who want to see the story told as it was originally written, and even then, approach it with the understanding that it was created with an ambitious intent that falls way short of the mark.

2312495,3,B0009PW4D2,"Despite the obvious flaws in the movie, I cannot join with the vitriol of many of its critics, who seem to characterize Timothy Hines as some kind of devil for making this movie.

I respect Hines for attempting to make a faithful adaptation of the Wells novel on basically a shoe-string.  And it is for this reason that I give it the third star.

Unfortunately, despite his good intentions, the movie fails on many levels; some technical, some creative choices.

First, the good news.  Having recently read the novel, I would agree with other reviewers that Hines was probably 95% accurate with the story line.  I also noted the scene with the farmer as non-canonical, along with the peculiar tea scene--which didn't seem to make any sense at all in terms of characterization or plot development.  The only purpose I could see in it was to demonstrate the ""playful"" nature of of the narrator's relationship with his wife.  But it failed to deliver and seemed sophomoric at best.  Otherwise the story was faithful, and that was encouraging, and frankly, the only thing that kept me watching.

Many flaws outweighed this strength.  The overall look of the film was tough to sit through.  After reading the other reviews, I now realize the jerky motion, and weird color filters were probably intentional by Hines to make the film seem like something out of an 1898 newsreel, if one could exist then.  But after three hours, it got a bit old, and instead of enhancing the story as a clever device, it detracted.  I've seen other movies that use a ""vintage newsreel"" technique, but normally only for an introduction, or to fill in back story.  Hines make the whole movie like this, and it's very distracting.

For the most part, the acting was really bad.  Ogilve was laughable.  The narrarator was pretty week until the scene where he is trapped in the demolished house with the curate.  That sequence, my favorite of the novel, was actually done pretty well by both actors.  The curate's performance was over-the-top, but having recently read the novel, Wells potrayed him exactly that way.  So I guess the actor did what he was supposed to do.  Nobody from this cast will win any awards, but it was at least passable.

For the most part, the special effects were pretty bad.  I think Hines did a decent job of the walking machines, they were the ""highlight"" of the visuals.  The martians themselves were unbelievable, and looked more like Sigmund and the Seamonsters than martians.  The real failure, as has already been noted many times, was the Thunder Child sequence.  Whereas the martian machines had been rendered ""adequately"", the Thunder Child was beneath the level of Hanna Barbera cartoons.  My guess is that the martian machines were perhaps the first effects he worked on, while he still had time and money, and he pulled them off to some degree.  But the Thunder Child was perhaps done in the last minute, with no money left, and rendered on his lunch hour.  I would almost have rather that Hines had simply cut the scene, or mentioned it in character dialog, if he couldn't portray it any better than that.  It ruined whatever benefit-of-the-doubt I had given him up until that point.

I also agree with other reviewers, that the interior scenes and crowd scenes, shot against blue/green screen with fake backgrounds, failed miserably.

No one else seems to have noted the bad dubbing job, either.  Rarely did the dialog or foley effects ever synchronize with the action.

Overall, I think he could have done a more convincing job by using miniatures than CGI.

So, in the final analysis, I respect Hines for trying to make the movie with so little money, and attempting to be faithful to the novel.

But he could have engendered so much more fan goodwill, and positive word-of-mouth, if he had not gone so far in the wrong direction with the visual look of the film.  With the groundswell of anticipation in the year leading up to its release, Hines had the chance to really make a cult-classic here, to satisfy the Wells purists.  He failed to deliver what he promised, however, and this explains the reactions of his viewing public.",1119225600,11,4146,4.761570827489481
2312496,5,B0009PW4D2,"I have noticed that many of the bad reviews here have been written by men. Once again, it has been left to the sisterhood who bore the pain of their birthing and the subsequent pain of their many rejections to see this film's true value clearly. It's not that men lack the sensitivity and the Third Eye to see below the surface, just that their Third Eye is located considerably further down south than ours. But for those with the heart and soul to see this true work of art for what it is, it is a totally fulfilling experience: nothing, not even the three best (and only) orgasms in my life or the bearing of my children has made me feel quite like this film. There is something truly tantric about this film: it goes on forever and keeps you on the edge throughout before ultimately fulfilling your spiritual needs in a way that even chocolate cannot. My soul sings still the song of his genius.

It reminded me of many of the great classics of science fiction that have been criticised by the male-dominated press - Catwoman with it's message of female empowerment through dressing like a $5 whore; Mars Needs Women with it's ruthless attack on the sexism of the Eisenhower era; Wild Women of Wongo, the `Iron John' of the feminist movement; and, of course, Queen of Outer Space, perhaps THE key feminist cinematic tract of the 20th century. If Chantal Ackerman ever directed a science fiction film, this would be it.

It's an epic journey, but an intimate one. Hines is a true artist and rather than employ hundreds of extras like some unimaginative bespectacled hack with a $140m budget, he chooses - and it IS a choice - to use the same twelve people to represent all of British society. We see them flee again and again and die again and again, and with each new death, our heart and womb cry out to the very heavens. In total war, all men and women are equal and all deaths matter and all tragedy is endlessly repeated. The fact it is deliberately artificial aliens, represented in the childish graphics of educational children's television to accentuate how little it takes to disrupt society in a world of fear like our own, rather than murderous heathen `aliens' from our own planet only shows how universal is all human suffering in time of war.

I too know what it is to lose family to war - I lost a husband in the First Anglo-Boer War, another in the Chinese Opium Wars and several close family members in the Hundred Years War. And, in a former life, I too was a Victorian woman who was abducted by aliens  - but mercifully not one who meets the fate meted out to an actress here. It is a mark of Hines' genius that he shows the way that women were (and still are) regarded as objects or property by having the Martians feed not on a real woman or a `naturalistic' special effect but through the use of a poorly animated doll - one of cinema's most biting and powerful critiques on the dehumanising of wimmin since the Karen Carpenter story was enacted by Barbie dolls. Watching this scene I thought how men made Martha Stewart pay for Wall Street's sins and my tears, they did flow.

I don't expect men to understand or appreciate this film. Their brains are too small, their attention too limited (the great Timothy Hines a rare exception, or is it the guiding hand of producer Susan Goforth - a strident name befitting a strident new feminist film classic). Yes, the main character is a man (albeit frequently emasculated by the loss of his moustache - a surrogate unwashed penis - in many bizarre dream sequences where he is with his wife but separated from her physically by a repressive representation of himself as his own imaginary brother), but he walks o'er hill and dale in search of the woman who is the film's true raison d'etre. It is to her, and to all women that this film truly belongs. Timothy Hines is a name for all wimmin to remember and cherish throughout the ages: were it possible I would bear his children that the sensitivity of his soul may live forever.",1119225600,10,3999,4.502754820936639

I can see where some of the people here are getting at though. The movie DID follow the book faithfully by pretty much telling everything that was written by the magic of H.G. Wells. So I guess that's fine. But I don't think that Mr. Wells would have appreciated such tripe from his book. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why Hines couldn't have made this movie better. To me, it's almost as if Hines was ""mocking"" the storyline or he just didn't care enough and just threw this slop together and called this a cult classic. I understand that this was a life-long dream of Mr. Hines. But couldn't you have made that dream seem sweeter if you actually took the time to create this? And what really surprised me was that DreamWorks helped fund this thing. Who knew?

Did you know that this was going to be released in theaters? I can't imagine what that would have looked like. OUCH! In the end of one of Mr. Hines' interviews, he said that we (the movie watchers) are going to be stunned on what they've done to this thing. Boy, he sure said a mouthful! But on Mr. Hines' side, he sounds like a giddy school-boy and is very proud of his work. Well in that case, good for you Mr. Hines!

But this doesn't ignore the thought of what my take of the movie is. So here is my take on some of the ""imperfections""...

The coloring of the movie was a bit funky. This didn't bode well when I was eating my popcorn. It kept reminding me of a carousel with lots and lots of pretty colors. Like blue, yellow, green.... Green? Did I say green? I was probably looking at my face in the mirror from me getting motion sickness.

What I thought was rather interesting was how Hines cut corners financially (at least it seemed like it) by hiring the same people (extras) for each village scene. Maybe the people had twins and triplets! OR the aliens made clones out of them! Anyway, when I kept seeing the same people, I just couldn't stop laughing because it was too obvious. I heard that it took Hines about 3 years to make this thing. Doing what? And the acting? Don't get me started on that. I swear for a minute I thought I was watching a silent film because some of the facial features during the dramatic scenes were overdone...burnt to a crisp. It almost makes me angry because my aspirations are to be an actress because I *know* I could have done better.

The special effects...did I say special? I mean, EFFECTS. They were bad. But the effects didn't bother me all that much because there were so many worse things that I can think of.

I loved the main character's mustache though. When there were bombs exploding, his hair and clothes were all ragged and every part of his skin was all smudged and dirty, his mustache always stayed neat and groomed. And I swear the thing on his face grew in one scene and shrank in the others...too weird.

One part of the movie really stood out though. When the main character was trying to run from the aliens in the river, a bunch of villagers followed him. Of course that's usually a good thing because the main character rarely dies in the middle of the movie. So you'd think the villagers would be safe right? WRONG! When one of the aliens died, it fell into the river and the water turned boiling hot. Of course the villagers died because who in the world could suffer such a devastating experience? Apparently the main character had something of a shield on because he popped out of the water like a beach ball all nice, pretty and healthy. That one did me in! LOL!! :)

I'm not going to go on and on because I'm sure you get the idea. I'm really frustrated because I'm seeing these positive reviews about this movie and it throws people off who haven't seen it yet (I guess this is why Amazon has these reviews for us to judge from our many different tastes). Everyone has their different tastes and if it's good for them, then I guess Hines did his job of pleasing at least someone.

Ultimately be your own critic and judge for yourself. If you don't want to buy, rent it before you make such a final decision. Who knows? You may be one of the few (if there really *are* the few who actually likes this) who actually likes this piece of doggie doody.",1119225600,18,4756,4.320627802690583

Its only redeeming quality is causing the viewer to wonder how long ago it was made.  To which the answer is ""not 1953"".

This stinker of a movie seems to have been made solely to trick customers who want to see the ""original"" before the new remake.  This isn't it.

Instead, go see anything else, whether or not science fiction.  Heck, see Spanglish.  It has good acting, an interesting story and characters, heart, and wonderful dialogue.",1119139200,15,704,4.848739495798319
2312500,5,B0009PW4D2,"This movie took me by surprise. I was expecting a low budget version of the upcoming Cruise/Spielberg vehicle, but I got something entirely different.

The movie is unique. From it's slow confident build-up, to the Martian invasion, to its moody battles with the Martians and the Earth's fall to their dominance, the filmmaking is resplendent.

Created like an old newsreel movie on a hand driven camera, the very core of this movie is transcendent. It has a commanding sureness of its approach. I felt like I was there, living with the characters as they awakened from their sleepy world to realize there is more than humans at the top.

Director Timothy Hines seems to have bitten off alot as he is credited as editor, photographer and director, but he sustains a balance that is hard to achieve in a three hour drama. I remember the endless camel shots in Lawrence of Arabia and an abundance of marching in Sparticus, and this movie has similar scenes. But they are in the book. It is what Wells described and Hines captures them in a way that makes you feel how hard it was to get around back then.

Some modern viewers might be impatient with this as everything is handed to us quickly today. Buzzing from place to place while taking phone calls and checking in with the internet, I can see where it would be hard for some to understand a time when people did less in a day. When they took time to enjoy a cup of tea or read a newspaper. People mostly walked back then. The carriage was for long journeys and the fast transport was the train only.

If one can slow down enough to let the film take you, it will, and the ride will be worth it.

The special effects are not like effects you have seen. They don't try to hide that fact that they are effects. They are more like jewels skillfully attached to the story. Just enough to fill out Wells'es vision.

The actors did a fine job and were perfectly believable in the roles, save for British accents that came and went from time to time. But this was not a distraction as the characters attempts to grasp what was happening all too quickly to their world was right. Jamie Lynn Sease did a superb job as a pouty young girl trying to be a woman and take care of her sister-in-law who is falling apart under the pressure. Anthony Piana is subtle and very watchable. Susan Goforth does a fine job as a sheltered wife who wants more freedom to decide her own destiny.

The music blends nicely with the style, which in itself is a tribute to musical scores that were once fuller and allowed to support the film. The Martian theme is done with heavy brass and the humans theme is done with strings. The writer's theme is light at first then slowly transists to a darker more serious mood. The artilleryman has a drum theme and human death's are scored with an operatic scope.

This was a film like no other. A bold and masterful work that will absolutley not appeal to some of the post video game ultra stimulation needing crowd. This is not the Fast and the Furious. This movie unfolds like an enchanting dream that slips into a gothic nightmare.

I was fascinated to the end. This movie will live for many years to come.",1119139200,60,3173,4.445783132530121
2312501,2,B0009PW4D2,"I've just finished watching this movie, and wanted to say that I actually enjoyed it, though with reservations.

First of all the directing and editing are pathetic, pathetic, pathetic. The composition of scenes and choices of filters and settings are for the most part amatuerish, to be charitable. In this regard I would like to say that those other reviewers who compare Mr. Hines talents to those of Ed Wood are not far from the mark.

Much the same can be said of the special effects, except that there are a few good effects, notably the design of the fighting machines. However the failings in graphics are more forgivable given the movie's limited budget.

What is much harder to forgive is the seeming total lack of planning and basic knowledge of filmmaking methods evident in the crowd scenes (or should I say the same crowd scene seen over and over again). An especially gross example of this lack of skill is the Thunder Child sequence, as other reviewers have pointed out.

The movie none the less deserves some praise simply because it does manage to convey the intensity and serious implications of the novel. It does this for two reasons. One is that it faithfully adheres to the book (with only one small exception that I observed). The other, and perhaps more important, is the marvelous performance delivered by Mr. Piana as the lead. He is totally believable in the role, and manages to carry the movie, despite sometimes completely incompetant performances by the rest of the cast.

I watched the movie in one sitting, and will probably watch it again some day, though I'm not in a hurry to do so. For the price of $9 I paid I feel I got my money's worth.",1119139200,19,1677,4.652027027027027
2312502,4,B0009PW4D2,"This is the strangest looking movie that I have ever seen. Except maybe David Lynch's DUNE. The colors are faded and in some places  almost two-tone. The effect works as an old movie somehow transported into modern times. The effects of the 100 foot high Martian fighting machines are good. It is very impressive how they made the special effects seem modern and retro at the same time.

Including the surreal effects, the movie is actually very good. It has important things to say about complacency and just going with the flow. And from what I know of this production, the film makers certainly did not do that.. There is are several plot points that demonstrate the folly of assumption. Very fitting for this day, as it was for the British in 1898.

The cast is very good. Anthony Piana is a solid a lead as the narrator and the brother!  Jack Clay does a very good job as Ogilvy, the astronomer. His perfomance has credibility that the role needs to sell us that Earth has been the recipient of a message from Mars in the form of some kind of time capsule.

Aside from some pacing issues, the movie is faithful to the book. This WAR OF THE WORLDS is a very fitting and appropriate movie version of the book. And it is the first version to place the story in its original setting.",1119139200,47,1284,4.446808510638298

2312508,5,B0009PW4D2,"My wife and I watched H. G. WELLS' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS last Monday night. We were so taken with this movie that we began to read some of the online comments about it. Catching up on the history of this production and following the reviews of the last week, we felt we had to add our own comments. We have never written an online review of a movie before. So this may not be a slick as some of those we have seen.

In the first place, my wife and I agree with the person who called a foul on those who gave this production a bad review before they had seen it. They called the director Ed Wood, said the movie was Plan Nine From Outerspace and said it belonged on a show that makes fun of movies call Mystery Science Theater.

When we looked through the posts, it was as this other poster had said. When the movie came out they applied the same comments they had made before they saw the movie and now were claiming them as their opinion of the movie itself.

The poster pointed out that they must have been psychic to know all these things before they saw the movie. Yes, we can see that for some reason, whether it is competitors or not, that there is a foul.

We finally had to post our own review when we saw these people posting a bad review but putting up five stars to confuse the potential viewer and make them not to trust any of the ratings.

After all the tricks and manipulations we have seen in American politics over the years, we could not keep silent and watch this happen without comment.

My wife and I have talked extensively about why such a campaign seems to be in place and the obvious answer makes us sad. There is enough manipulation in the media and in our political system that to see this kind of effort in the promotion of movies, well, there's nowhere left to run. Even our fantasies are being controlled.

We reasoned that readers can tell the difference between the twisting and influencing of other's views. As Abraham Lincoln said, ""You can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.""

So for the readers to decide for themselves, here is our honest review:

From the very beginning this movie is not trying to be a ""Hollywood movie"". It is a unique piece of filmmaking that transports the viewer to another time. The time is of the turn-of-the-century.

It was as if this film was made when H. G. Wells wrote the story back in the Victorian period. It plays like a fusion between modern technology and turn-of-the-century technology.

the colors are like old hand tinted photographs and the pacing is of another time, when people rode around in buggies and had time to visit and think about the world around them.

Their is a sometimes jerkiness to the film speeds that is like old movies that were hand cranked and yet in keeping with the fusion idea, the sound remains in sync.

We were caught up in this world of another time. The modern world fell away and three hours of the production floated by. there was an effervescence to the imagery and a tip to the surrealism of 1920's films with painted backdrops.

But, unlike what others have said, this is ovbviously not ineptitutde on the part of the story tellers, but a blending of modern and old.

The filmmakers took their limited budget and made choices that were innovative in doing this. Not just copying and making a cheaper version of Hollywood special effects.

This is illustrated in several places. In one scene a young singer belts out a tune where she talks about her ruling the world. The colors and the tint made it feel as if it were actually filmed at the time an inhanced with modern technology. The same goes for a scene where the reporter and his wife are sitting at a dinner table with their cousins.

The scene felt exactly as though it were recorded on old glass plate photography of another time, where the photographer nestles up under a black cloth and sets off an explosive charge to get enough light into the camera to record the image. This was genius.

All of the effects have some aspect of this quality and it serves the movie fully.

In fairness, not all bad reviews here may be from these people who are trying to influence the potential viewer. Some just may not get it. It's like rock music. Most of our grandparents never got it. Their grandparents never got Benny goodman and swing music. A new way of telling stories scares some and they reject it outright.

Change can be scary, but in this case its good. We applaud this innovative movie. There is no other like it. It is fresh and one of a kind.

It is a perfect telling of H. G. Wells book of Martian invasion. The action and effects and everthing about it is as though it was the recorded history of how humanity servived the Martians and and how fragile our existence is. The acting perfectly supports this.

My wife and I agree that we will cherish this movie and it will remain in our imaginations for years to come. We encourage people to see for themselves and are saddened by, what appears to be, an anger driven campaign to bury this picture.

Our honest rating is five stars. We hope for more movies that take risks and push the boundries of our complacency. That is what Wells was trying to say in the story after all.",1119052800,63,5300,4.374745417515275
2312509,5,B0009PW4D2,"I had been hearing about this version of WotW for over a year and had little hope for it from the trailer I'd seen.  Suddenly, last week I read a message thread saying that the movie was available at Wal-Mart.  Well, we have only one Wal-Mart here in Chicago, but in a bizarre turn of events, I stumbled across it in the DVD bin at CVS pharmacy!

The girl at the counter looked at it and actually said, ""Isn't this supposed to be coming out in the theaters soon?""

""No,"" I told her, ""This is a different version. Apparently it's a huge piece of ****.""

""Then why are you buying it?"" she asked.

""I like bad movies."" I said. ""I've seen them all.""

Then I watched it.  Wow.

I'm a huge fan of the book and I must concede that this movie does follow the book very faithfully. That much I give to Tim Hines, the director of this film.

Everything else is a wondrous and almost supernatural trek into how a movie can go completely and utterly wrong.  The acting is eerily reminiscent of Monty Python if performed by Americans feigning British accents.  The protaganists moustache is clearly a fake and the actor removes it to take on the role of his brother.  I can't imagine the thought process that came to the conclusion that this  switch would work.

There is an overuse of CGI which is also inexplicable.  Simple things such as horse-drawn carts are poorly rendered in a move that must have cost as much if not more than constructing a prop and renting a horse for a day.  The red weed is CGI, the martians are CGI and the distant human armies are CGI. None of them are done in a convincing fashion whatsoever.

And the tripod fighting machines.  There is one shot of a tripod rising from the pit that looks okay.  Their movement outside of that one scene is miserably realized. Never once will anyone be convinced that these things are interacting with the enviromnment.  When they walk through the water in the laughable battle with the Thunderchild, they don't seem to even disturb the surface.

It was the first time I've ever watched a movie I knew was going to be bad where I found myself out of my league.  Thus and so, I loved it.  Anyone who comes to my house will be made to watch it as it stands as a one-of-a-kind experience.  Tim Hines talked a big game over this movie, quoting it's cost at over 20 million and lauding his leading man as the next Pacino.  For a straight to DVD release at CVS, word has gotten around for this thing. A lot of people are going to seek this out just for the sake of curiosity and that puts Hines right up there with Barnum.

I give the movie itself 2 stars, but rate it a 5 because I don't regret buying it and people will be talking about it for years to come.  Spelbergs WotW will be amazing, but it won't be best pic of the year. Hines' movie WILL be the worst of the year, if not the decade.",1119052800,8,2840,4.277673545966229
2312510,3,B0009PW4D2,"I have followed the TIMBO saga for the past year at least, It seemed to go on for ever, I defended this film believing that the footage being shown was 'test level semi rendered footage', How silly I feel now.

where to start ......

The Special effects, Dreadful, bad copositing, bad animation, almost laughable, some of it is very cartoonish.(The second shot of the 'Flying Machine is very good though' unfortunately THUNDERCHILD is errm odd. And the Alien cow? which I think they brought with them to feed of is the start of the worst SFX scene in history.

The Acting, The accents were the WORST british accents in movie history, Arnie the Terminator could do a better british accent, mostly far too many theater type Gestures for my liking.

mind you they seem to be mediocre stage actors. (Ogilvy was way over the top, I expected him to dress in shakespearean clothing)

The Story, Quite faithful to the book, but the writer/director (Mr TIMBO Hines) of this movie seemed to miss the point and a few scenes, dead London was cut to minimal, and the descriptions of some points were not as faithful as Mr Hines claimed, Glaring errors being the alien weaponry the 'Heat Ray' and the 'Black Smoke Launcher' were well nothing like as described in the book [the director claimed to be 100% faithful to the descriptions/story to the smallest detail but managed 80%]

Period Accuracy, Oh dear the british army Hussars in red coats do make a very brief appearance, but the army is made up of WW1 uniforms and American civil war equipment + uniforms. the clothing close enough and the set of victorian England is obviously in America.

THE FILM ITSELF

Despite it's many many flaws I actually really enjoyed it, the few INTENTIONAL comedy elements (Ogilvy convincing people about life in the cylinder is badly done but hilarious) are quite fun.

some of the walking scenes could be cut but they didn't bother me too much.

The atmosphere of the film seemed quite good, I think that was the cool soundtrack though, the three hours passed rather quickly and I enjoyed the film immensly.

as I got into the film I got used to the terrible accents and HAM acting, (The curate scenes were very well done though, the best part of the movie), I could even manage the not-so-special effects.

Now since I followed this Saga through many delays and dissapointments from the director (at one point rumours were that the film would never surface) I was expecting it to be really bad, so my expectations were to expect a 50's style B Movie,

That is what it is folks a Mega Low Budget cult B-movie, (mind you I Enjoy bad movies like ""The Stuff"" [Killer Yoghurt] )

for the price it's worth a look out of curiosity, But beware this film is not for General entertainment, most People will hate it, if you are thinking of buying this do your research on it from the many war of the worlds sites out there, then make your own mind up.

so to some up, If you like movies like the Original ""The Blob"" or ""PLAN 9 from outer space"" or ""Attack of the killer tomato's""

then you may enjoy this movie.

or if you want to be reminded of 70/80's made for sunday afternoon TV then buy and enjoy.",1119052800,8,3166,4.545774647887324
2312511,5,B0009PW4D2,"I don't know what to say. But I had to say something. I loved this movie.

It takes place in another world. A Victorian world of the past, where people thought before speaking, took the time and space to learn more than a sound bite before acting. And yet, a place when man's arrogance led us in ignorance to a place where survival was our only option.

This movie is like no other. It's like a painting of the past, yet accesible, very easy to understand and be sucked into.

Simply put, a young man and his wife live in the country in England where he is a reporter. A meteor comes down from Mars and crashes near their house and deploys Martians ready for war. The unsuspecting Victorians at first try to help the poor beast creatures, then defend themselves against them. Very soon, it is revealed that the Martians are far superior in warfare and the humans must do everything necessary to survive.

The reporter takes his wife to a relative's house for safety. They fight over separating, but he wants to see the war insue and goes back to watch the Martians be destroyed. This is where he discovers the Martians have bested the humans and strives just to stay alive, never knowing if a Martian is just around the corner.

From here the story is the reporter's journey to reunite with his wife. Really, what else matters in the end but those you love, eh?

It also follows the tales of the reporter's brother in London and how he escapes the city with two beautiful upper-crust women. The brother rescues the ladies from a group of criminals, then the brother travels with the ladies away from the martians. The dynamics between these three is amazing. I've never seen a movie handle a bunch of strangers falling in together so well, with such dimension.

The acting in this movie is exceptional. I was just blown away. The nuances and relationships between the characters was right on. And the ending is a tear jerker.

Besides this being dramaticly moving, it also has a lot of humor. The astronomer who first finds the meteor at the beginning tries to tell someone that there is a man inside burning to death. The guy he tells not only doesn't believe him, but thinks he's a lunatic. It's very funny. This isn't slapstick humor, but naturally funny. The reporter travels with a man about halfway through the movie that is clearly traumatized by the martian invasion. This blonde fellow is so nervous and afraid you can't help but laugh at his blunders. And it all works.

I've lost people very close to me, and to see the reporter's journey to his loved ones was very special to me. The sadness of war, the families touched by loss and separation in the movie is well worth the cost of the movie.

The DVD also has biographical information on the author of the book the movie is based on.

This movie is not a hollywood movie, it is something else. Something beautiful and moving and I highly recommend it.

Have fun.",1118966400,65,2926,4.531309297912713
2312512,5,B0009PW4D2,"War of the Worlds is a dark tale written in 1898, taking place around 1900, about man's transient place in nature, and the effects of modern machinery on human struggle, whether the machines are in the hands of humans or another species entirely. In the original book, humankind and the narrator are both in defeat and despair at the end, saved for the time being not by any human effort or invention, but by the accidental vulnerability of the Martians to a bacterial organism--another natural species entirely.

This engaging film tells the story in full, including dialogue taken almost verbatim by the page from the original. The visuals are photographed or processed to simulate early 20th Century hand-cranked cameras and projectors, so motion is at variable speeds, with the flickering quality of sub-24-frame-per-second projection. The color is in the style of tinted or two-color process early film (such as sequences in Hell's Angels or the original King of Kings). The actors act like people of 1900, in speech, manner and sentiment. The audio quality is modern, with a good symphonic score.

Special effects echo an earlier age of film, even those effects probably duplicated with  CGI rather than modelling and stop-motion. Folks who have to have modern graphics won't like it, period. However this film is a story being told, not an imitation of an imaginary hyper-reality handed to an audience. It requires an extention of the viewer's mind, and rewards that effort with a journey through the world of Herbert George Wells. The Martian war machines and the reduction of their victims to skeletons, as well as the occasional squashing-flat of the stomped-on are efforts which Harryhausen would appreciate (though one sequence of naval combat would have been regarded as primitive by D W Griffith).

Because of the fidelity to the book, and probably because the film is released on DVD without preliminary editing for an American theatre audience, it runs three hours, a sort of director's cut. For those who get into the creative stye of the film and enjoy the details of the authentic story, this is not too long.",1118966400,21,2128,5.019830028328612
2312513,5,B0009PW4D2,"Before I give my review, I would like to say that I have been following the history of this production for several years. I first heard about the production before September 11th and like most, was saddened that it shut down.

When Steven Spielberg announced that he was doing a version of the WAR OF THE WORLDS I was happy that the story would be told after all. Then this little company rose from the ashes with a version already filmed. I followed the ups and downs as the fans embraced and alternately rejected the indie filmmaker for his perceived actions with publicity or what they thought his version might or might not be.

After a period of silence, in which I assume the indie was finishing their movie, they reappeared with a new movie trailer. By this time, some of the fans seemed crystalized against the indie. I watched with a morbid fascination in the weeks prior to the movie's release as some assailed the film with a personal vengeance.

One thing I noticed was, that, as a few in the chat rooms were  pointing out, those against the indie, were reviewing the movie before it came out or any of them had seen it.

The thing they kept saying about it was that the acting was sub par, the movie was Plan Nine From Outer Space, it belonged on Science Mystery theater and the director, Timothy Hines was Ed Wood.

When the movie DID come out, they just kept saying the same thing. From an impartial obsverver's perspective, I call foul.

Unless those against the indie were psychic, they couldn't have possibly known the acting was sub par, that the movie was like Plan Nine From Outerspace, that it belonged on Science Mystery theater or that Timothy Hines had done an ""Ed Wood"" job of directing prior to the movie's release.

And yet, here they are all over the Amazon review board with THE EXACT SAME REVIEWS they  gave the movie BEFORE THEY SAW IT. WHAT? WHAT?

Some of their points may have been valid, but it is to their discredit that they have been so blatently unfair to Timothy Hines and his small company, thus invalidating any REAL dabate on the qualities of his work.

I, therefore, watched the film with an objective eye as possible and here is what I found:

Although the movie IS a bit slow, the acting is not at all sub par. It is actually very good and the narrator/brother characters played by Anthony Piana are well above par. Ogilvy, played by Jack Clay, is outright top par, as is the curate and Mrs. Elphinstone. The accents are not bad as some have said. Not super, but no worse than any big movie with actors playing characters from another country than their own. But the performances are far more than accent. Hines wisely focused on the story and what direves the characters as oppesed to a study in accents.

One can see that a great effort was made to produce a  quality production on a limited budget, but the effects are NOT Plan Nine From Outer Space, nor is Timothy Hines a modern ED WOOD. The movie's effects are not all that bad. Some, in fact most, are actually quite good. And the story is a well told adaptation of H. G. Wells'es story.

Again I call a foul on those who are against the inde and his version. In reading their posts on IMDB over time, one can see that they are not interested in whether or not this is a good movie. Their reviews are hollow in the face of what I pointed out about. I'm sorry, but it had to be said.

There is some kind of injustice here and it is very easy to see, if one just looks.  I wish Hines well in his success. He has had to endure much to make his vision. I don't think these others will go away, but perhaps, by exposing them, there can be a more fair judgement of this work.

I say to the indie Hines, remember that many classic films received such controversy. The movies remain, what the critics said faded away.

This was a good movie.",1118966400,70,3837,4.386459802538787
2312514,1,B0009PW4D2,"I have seen some utter, utter garbage in my time; I have sat through

flicks by Al Adamson and Ed Wood, I have endured some of the worst

student films of all time and, I'm proud to say, I even made one of the

worst student films of all time but this is from another dimension.

Nothing can even begin to describe the stench arising from this piece

of filth. Where can I possibly begin? The performances are universally

abysmal. I mean amateurish is one thing, the acting in a Timothy Hines

film is another. Anthony Piana not only varies between American and

Australian accents but he manages to mix in Scots, Irish, Welsh, North

Yorkshire and Jordie tones as well; everything except what he is

supposed to. James Lanthrop is a joke. I don't even know where he is

supposed to be from. He started the movie with an American accent and

slowly graduated to communicating with sounds I never thought any human

being was biologically capable of making. Jack Clay plays Ogilvy as if

he were hard of hearing, always putting his hand to his ear, SHOUTING

and making theatrical gestures... I could go on but it's to

embarrasingly painful. The special effects deserve mention though; there

are none. Hilarity ensues from the first frame. The CGI bares absolutely

no interaction between the real elements of the frame, the actors and

the camera movements. Coupled to this is the utter stupidity of the

digital grading; night, day, sunrise, sunset, nuclear winter, smog

pollution and a bad LSD trip are all depicted at anyone time. I'm

guessing Timothy Hines has never been to the UK as he doesn't seem to

know that over here, our air is made of Nitrus Oxide too and not, as

the photography in the film would suggest, an Argon/Carbon Dioxide mix.

Which brings me to my biggest gripe; the location work. CGI shots of

London show it to be a 14th century village surrounding Big Ben. Big

Ben is shown as a freestanding structure, which it is not, and never

has been. Weirdly, the film opens with old silent footage of London and

a clear view is afforded of the real Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.

God knows why nobody thought to use this as a template. Other concerns

are the backgrounds; sometimes actual ""real world"" locations are used

(well, a field), other times very bad blue screen work inserts the

characters into photoshop backgrounds executed by someone who cannot

even switch on a pocket calculator. At other times, VERY American

architecture can be seen in the background and indeed, most of the

costumes are American in design. Much of the unintentional belly laughs

come from the CGI horses, people and vehicles used in wide shots. There

is a scene of a man running out of a church and getting flipped through

the air by a martian war machine that will give you bladder problems

for weeks. Believe me, the Big Ben shot in the trailer is the least the

films problems. And what happened to such concepts of pace, cutting and

location changes? In some sequences we get to see characters walk for

ten minutes at a time, at others, the transtions are so quick that it

is impossible to follow what is going on, even if you have read the

book. I wish I had room here to analyse every frame; notice how, after

a surprise explosion the Artillery Man throws himself against a door

with an electric doorbell on it; all the (electric !) street lamps are

those round American ones instead of the slim, rectangular British

ones; the soldiers wear uniforms from three different periods; NO

research into any aspect of 1890's period detail, of Britishness, of

military procedure or even of how to actually make a film has been

done at all. Bizarre, pointless things happen. An eternity is spent

showing the Writer and his wife sitting with their friend at a table

and the only thing that happens for five or ten minutes is that the

Writer picks up a chocolate with his fork, pops it into his glass,

knocks the glass over and then eats the chocolate, all the while

looking like a pantomime villain in is mad fake moustache, which Piana

takes off for when he plays the Writer's Brother. This is, beyond any

shadow of a doubt is the worst film ever made anywhere. EVER. I hope

Hines is reading this and taking note because someone has to make him

understand he is incapable of filming wedding videos, let alone

adaptations of classic novels. The whole three hours is nothing more

than a joke. A three hour insult to the general public who purchase

this. Yes, Tim, we Do notice when you use the same extras over and over

again. We CAN tell the backgrounds are fake. We ARE aware that what you

may think is London is in fact some fantasy land out of Harry Potter.

And no matter how much frame judder you think is going to make the

photography look filmic, we are quite capable of recognising cheap

video work when we see it. I have only one thing to say about Timothy

Hines; ""Stop Him Before He Films Again!!!""",1118966400,13,4957,4.5608646188850965
2312515,3,B0009PW4D2,"I have read all of the previous reviews-as of 6/17/2005-and I am puzzled why some people keep comparing this movie to ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""  Although both suffer from a limited budget, the source material is quite different.  At first the low production value was distracting, as was a number of scenes that needed to be cut, but once the invasion got under way I was emotionally involved all the way to the end.

If you have not seen it, consider this: a large budget does not always ensure a quality film.  ""Star Wars Episode I"" and ""Independence Day"" both come to mind.  In spite of the excellent special effects, neither one had a compelling story; however the original WOTW's plot is so gripping that it has been copied numerous times.

Those of you that fast forwarded after watching a few minutes, missed out on that story that was supported by worthy performances, especially the artillery man who underwent a transformation from fearless solider to harden veteran and then to a man with a deluded sense of reality.  I was convinced of his conversion as I had seen it happen to many Vietnam vets.

For the record, I am not affiliated with Pendragon Pictures, but I can relate to their experience.  In my youth I was in community theatre which also dealt with limited funds.  We made due with what we had and we were hammered because of it, in spite of our hard work.  Most of you have never experienced being on public display.  If you have then asks yourself these questions.  Do you have all the necessary resources to do your job?  Can your work stand up to public scrutiny?

I recommend this picture for its effort to capture the essence of the original text.  As flaw as it is, no major studio would have undertaken this project without setting the story in contemporary time, casting it with beautiful people, and having at least one sex scene.  In other words, the standard Hollywood cookie-cutter production that fails to become quality science fiction.",1118966400,46,1974,4.6753623188405795
2312516,2,B0009PW4D2,"Like other reviewers I have always enjoyed HG Wells' War of the Worlds and was looking forward to seeing an adaptation set in the early 1900s when Wells' story is set.  However, the acting in this film is dreadful.  The characters are 1 dimensional and simply don't interact. In fact wooden is the only term that comes to mind. I could forgive the awful CGI effects but when combined with a poorly directed, edited and acted film the end result is barely watchable.

The reason I have given it two stars is because it is faithful to the book and therefore Wells' story telling manages to come through-just.

A hefty re-edit and deletion of some of the worse CGI effects might improve the film, for example, let us imagine the Martians feeding.

But it was so emotional for us that some of the women cried when the artilleryman was trapped under the bodies and watched all of the destruction of the soldiers and the town. This movie has respect for the soldiers and didn't make fun of them. We could feel their bravery as they faught what was a losing battle against the aliens. The faith that the main character has that he will see his wife again made the movie worthwhile. A great effort of a movie that overcomes it's budget to tell the story of war.

A girl I know told me that this Mystery Science Theater is a show for stoners. You don't need to be stoned to enjoy this War Of The Worlds. It would, in fact probably make it harder to understand, as the film makers have translated the entire book, and some of Wells' ideas require some continuous thought. But I'm surprised that these stoners don't just ""zone out"" on the action and the Martian walking machines.

This movie delivers all the way. I am glad I bought it.

I was really looking forward to Pendragon version since its the only adaptation to be based around the time of the HG Wells book.

This is the worst film I've ever seen.  The acting is dire - i.e.,  the first time  the heat ray is used and kill the on lookers around the pit.  It takes them minutes to die, they are waving their arms around - it is quite a sad.

The CGI very really poor.  As other people have said the Thunderchild scenes are horrendous..  CGI is overly used - even when the narrator is knocking on a door prior to his and wife's journey to Leatherhead.  Even the horse that pulls the carriage is CGI!

Additionally the frame rate leaves a lot to be desired, at times it is quite jerky.

However, the music is good, albeit a little repetitive.

I shall never watch this film again, and will take a permanent fixtures amongst my other War of the Worlds DVDs.

Well yes, if you exclude the dwarves, the cast of thousands, the great special effects, the big battles, the strong characterisation, the decent plot, the good acting, the classy direction and everything else. Which leaves you with the walking. And boy, does this film do walking! If Mr Piano had his way, this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so these pesky Martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble. You've never seen so much walking in a movie. If this really had a $20m budget, most of it must have gone on Mr Piano's shoes, because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does. Which explains why there's no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or proper actors. Honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes. Even on fast-forward, this is a looonnnggg walk.

As for the sci-fi stuff, I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the film: they only get in the way of the walking, which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story.

2312523,2,B0009PW4D2,"Well, I just finished watching this and don't quite know where to begin.

I am probably one of the more lenient people you will ever meet when it comes to low or zero-budget movies. This was a project I had been following with great interest. The very idea that somebody sought to faithfully recreate the H.G. Wells novel in movie form intrigued me, I suppose, because nobody had ever previously attempted it. While I do honestly appreciate the ambition Timothy Hines might very well have possessed when he conceived this film, I cannot help but conclude that he fell far short of delivering the shining result he so foolishly promised.

This was not, by any stretch, a professional or theater-worthy production. For Mr. Hines to proclaim to the world that it was is clearly nothing short of a misrepresentation. He should therefore show no surprise when people across the board are slamming the film he told everyone would blow their socks off. I pretty much knew beforehand that Pendragon's budget for this was very minimal. Mr. Hines, I truly believe, knew that as well. But he still went ahead and rushed the movie out onto DVD with unfinished special effects that do nothing more than make you wish the movie was a lot less shorter than the three agonizing hours that it currently is. Now, were Hines the type of man to state upfront that he did not possess the funds he previously boasted....fan reaction would probably have been far more forgiving. But, he was not upfront about anything. He lied, and that is not something any aspiring filmmaker should ever do.

I really did, for all intents and purposes, enjoy the film's first hour. The martian and heat ray intros were particular standouts. But, from there on, everything took a complete and total nosedive. I have seen many movies with budgets lower than this, and there was not one of them that could not easily afford exterior filming. Why Mr. Hines chose to abuse CGI in such a gross manner throughout this production staggers my line of rational thinking. The sepia toning and differing color schemes I could handle, but not the constant and obviously artificial computer generated backgrounds.

Perhaps, had Hines taken the time to polish up the scattershot effects and trim down the running time, we would have been treated to something slightly better. Unfortunately, that is not what happened.

I had already planned on catching Steven Spielberg's film. And now, having seen this tragic case of squandered potential, I am even more hyped. Bring it on, Steven, bring it on!",1118793600,14,2543,4.850230414746544

In all actuality, it is tht horrible.  I'm still watching this movie as we speak and I'm so disappointed and quite bewildered.

Besides the fact that it follows the book perfectly, this movie is possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Those who put aside the bad acting and visual effects are forgetting that a good movie is based on great preformances and fantastic scenes.  All of which this movie has no attributes of.  I figured that with the budget they had, they could have come out with something better.

I watched the first 20 minutes of the DVD (which was all I could handle) and was struck by the following:

1. The transcoding is awful. Jerky beyond belief. I think someone got their PAL and NTSC mixed up. This *alone* makes the film unwatchable.

2. A wildly inconsistent color scheme that varies from flaming orange hues to dim blue black with no rhyme or reason; in the same scene! Utterly distracting.

3. Very dated special effects and awful mattes. Charitably some of the industrial design for the Martian technology was well done.

4. Screaming skeletons? When the first onlookers are zapped by the Martian heat ray they are flashed into skeletons that continue to scream and move! Huh? Even my 10 year daughter was wondering what was going on.

5. When the crowd presses in on the impact crater and the first Martian emerges we get long scenes of people staring, looking horror stricken. So long their impact simply fades away. Their greatest  indication of the pending horror is to put their hands over their mouths. This is acting?

Replace the Martian war in the story with the modern war raging and it seems to speak to the issues of today. The movie makers did a nice job in telling the 1898 story and focused on the characters.

The acting was very skillful and often times deeply moving. The religious man is tragic and funny at the same time. A fine line and he pulled it off. The main character made me feel that I was on the road with him to find his wife. There's one moment when he realizes that he caused his situation by overprotecting her and I could feel his desperation at no way to fix it.  It was wierd because my husband, who is in Iraq, just wrote me a letter and said very similar things. I felt the same desperation when a woman talks about having missed meeting her husband and you can feel her struggle at not blaming herself. But nobody is to blame because that is what happens in war. I didn't detect any of the below par performances others on here have written about.

As I said, my husband is in Iraq and I felt a strong  connection to this movie. It was as if the movie was addressing the problems one has to deal with as a family is parted in times of war.

I didn't think it was Planet nine from outer space at all. But maybe if you are a sci-fi fellow you see this movie in a different way. But I foolowed it all with none of the things bothering me that some have talked about. And the colors were strong and made sense to me. Also, I didn't find anything wrong with the DVD.

It is so bad, that the crew of people that were watching it with me, started laughing our heads off, just due to the sheer stupidity that is portayed by the actors, production staff, director and editor of this film.

I feel the $8.00 I paied for this at WalMart was wasted.  But I bought it due to the review I initially saw on Amazon.  The first copy I bought was floating around in the case and was all scratched up.  I took it back and enchanged it for a new one.  But to find one that wasn't floating in it's case, I had to check, 10 cases and the last one on the rack, was the only one held firmly in it's case.  After opening the case, I now understand why.  I have never seen a case made so cheaply as this one was.

Most of the movie is spent by watching actors walk, run, stride, strut or ride around on game trails, dirt roads or through fields.  If you cut all the walking out, this movie would only be about 20 minutes long.  Thank heavens for Fast Forward.  All the CGI was like an old computer game out of the early 80's.  The integration between CGI buildings and the real buildings portrayed, was absurd.  This gets a negative 5 star rating in any book for anyone that chooses to waste their money on it.

The only reason we continued to watch it, was to see just how bad it could get.  The horses running in the back ground, didn't move at the pace they were supose to be moving and were ""slipping"" their way across the screen, as did all people portrayed in the back ground.

The sheer lack of skill and lack of basic physics, is to laugh at.  The heat ray burned the clothes and skin off the people in a few seconds on some and 5 mintues on others and other it just blew apart.  But the most laughable thing had to do with the skeletons left behind after all the skin, muscle, tendons and tissue was gone.  They continued to thrive in pain and agony, even though there was no flesh on them.  Like out of the Sinbad saga, where he was fighting with swords.

Anybody willing to actually purchase this movie, should buy a keg of beer and get totally drunk and then just throw away the DVD before they watch it.  Cause that is the only way to enjoy it.

To be fair, the first hour or so played very nicely.  I actually enjoyed the slower pace getting to the cylinder opening scene.  I appreciated some of the character development during this time.  It often felt like a PBS British drama.  Also found the first sighting by the narrator of the Martian machines in the storm to be a creepy part.  I liked the artilleryman's retelling of the events he experienced, too.

However, after that point I felt that the film just moved too slowly and had too few battle scenes and the ones that were there were too short.  No momentum or sign of great distress on the part of the populace. Where were the mobs of people evacuating before the Martians?  Basically we just see 4 or 5 people at a time escaping.  Especially disappointing was the Thunderchild scene where it almost seemed like the folks on the boat were out on a holiday or something!

Special effects?  Already covered elsewhere in other reviews.  Day for night shots were really the worst thing, though, and too many CGI rooms, horses, people, etc.  What I did like were the color effects and the starry skies that were used.  Like someone else already mentioned, and my wife and I had discussed as well, the color tints and the jerkiness of the film made it look like a film of the period.  Might play better with the color turned off!

Am I happy with this film?  No.  Do I hate it?  No.  Maybe it could be re-cut, special effects worked on, and shown as a mini-series on TV!",1118620800,18,1644,4.4280936454849495

However, the jerkiness of the DVD transfer (missing frames, poor frame rate...whatever) makes it unwatchable. A pity as the design of the martians and their huge walkers was very creative in this version. Let's hope its re-released on a higher quality pressing.",1118620800,12,371,5.098360655737705
2312534,3,B0009PW4D2,"All in all this is a fair DVD outing if you feel so inclined.  I have read the message boards on IMDB and yes, the acting is sub par at best.  The story is faithful to the book about 90% of the time and the CGI is, at best, like that of a first year art student.  Was that supposed to be a cow? The alian tripods are a great rendering.  Concerning teh CGI, we are so spoiled by state of the art effects that when something doesn't meet or exceed our expectations we become critical.  This might have been due to budgetary restraints.

When it comes to the ""style"" the film was made (cinematography), to me, that was ingenious.  It was almost like seeing some of the old tinted Victorian stereo-opticon(?)cards and ""magic lanterns"" of the same time period come alive. The tintings used were in stark contrast to say the normal color of whatever it would be in nature. (ex. red bush (bright reds), cool blues, sickly greens. We all forget that ""Technicolor"", either two (2) strip or three (3)strip was not true color. That's what made them so colorful and phony looking.  Watch Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" for one of the last and greatest uses of the three (3)strip process. Very surreal!

The jerky picture style in some areas reflects that of the early silent movies from the time.  Anyone here ever heard of George Melies?  His early films were similar to the style used.

Getting to the movie (acting, etc).  Yes the acting IS 3rd rate at best but watchable for one viewing - especially the priest -- very ""Plan 9"".  Most reactions are far too broad. The story itself, as I said, does go by the book almost all the time.

Maybe more money, a real studio backing it and better direction could have improved on the movie.  I saw all the negatives about Mr. Hines (aka ""Timbo"") on the IMDB along with these on Amazon and, well, 'nuf said.  Never met the guy but he had a good idea. It's too bad the studios could not back his vision and given us a better product.

With the near release of the Spielberg version of ""War of the Worlds"" I thought I would take a chance, bought it and really do not regret it.  If asked would I sit through another viewing, well, if I will-I will, but I'm in no hurry.  I will in the future. Beautiful visuals, throughout!! Yes it was not a great film, but I have seen much worse and done by major studios.  ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""?  Not at all.",1118620800,58,2375,4.35
2312535,4,B0009PW4D2,I don't know about all the stuff people are talking about on here about how you make movies. But I se movies all the time and this movie was very good.

2312536,4,B0009PW4D2,"After having read a line of reviews on here my expectations for this film were pretty low. I had wanted to see this movie for a long time, but had read that it wasn't good.

When it started to play I was ready to turn it off. But the credits were clean and sucked me in. Then it went directly to a quote by Kepler and I felt the movie was not playing down to me. Then this wonderful turn-of-the century archival footage comes up and the narrator begins speaking in a somber tone about the complacency of huminity and humanity's belief in their own rightful place at the top of the food chain and I started to relax a little. When the image switches to a full color Mars looming over the planet Earth, I was no longer waiting to stop the movie.

This movie was, in fact, quite good. The acting, in spite of what I read by some of the others, was not bad. It was, in fact, quite good. Every point was true and solid. Having lived in England for a year, the accents weren't at all bad. A bit Americanized. But no more, by any means, than many blockbuster movies. I was expecting Kevin Costner's poor accent from Robin Hood. Or Jude Law's British accent in the civil war story Cold Mountain. But they weren't that at all. They were a bit full and posh, but no more then any period BBC piece.

I was able to tune out the British accents and enjoy the story with no trouble. The story and the art direction carried me through quite nicely. The costumes were not out of period, but fit the time perfectly. I had even read that the bicycle was supposed to be wrong. But I deal in antiques and it was prefectly period. The film was, in fact, so well done, that I thought I must have had another version than the one others saw.

It is amazing how people's views of something can differ so much. But this picture was an epic, through and through. There were many innovative and stylised techniques that fit the story. The stuttery quality from time to time made the movie feel old. As if I was actually watching old footage from the turn of the century. The same with the colors. It felt like an old photograph.

I'm not big on effects. I think too many movies focus too much on that element. Well, they could have done a bit more here, sometimes. But not all the time. Most of the effects were quite good and carried the moment, though I could tell sometimes they weren't really riding in the cart. But I can tell that they're not really rifing a car in others movies too. It wasn't a problem. The Martian tripod walking machines were very effective. But I was far more interested in what the two sisters were saying about not being able to find the husband, or when the wife is pleading with the narrator not to leave her with their cousin.

I felt the narrator's journey in trying to correct his mistake and return to his wife. And like Joseph Cambell talked about, discover himself and the meaning of life along the way. I felt the tragedy in the curate as his views were tested and failed. I felt the emptyness of the artilleryman.

This was a classic film that will live beyond all the technical reviews of the moment. At present, this movie may be overshadowed by the updated Spielberg version of the same story, but it will live in its own right. It is a true epic and will take its place with other epics.",1118620800,70,3304,4.285256410256411
2312537,1,B0009PW4D2,"I got this at Walmart for $9.00, which IMO is $9.00 too much. Simply put, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen..it easily surpasses howlers like ""Battlefield Earth"". From CGI graphics inferior to an average PS2 game, 60's era special effects, the awful cinematography, ludicrous acting, and excessive length, it is a complete waste of time and money. The other reviews critical of this ""film"" are dead on accurate, this movie stinks!!!!!",1118620800,18,449,4.921052631578948
2312538,1,B0009PW4D2,"First, to justify my review... I have been a professional videographer/editor/ director since the late 70's. I have acted professionally (mostly stage) since the 80's. I have written scripts, some good, some bad. And like many others I have always wanted to do/see a period production of ""War of the Worlds"". Money and the difficulty in adapting the story has always been an issue.

So I looked forward to the release of Hines' film with great anticipation. Finally, the film version we've all been waiting for. I was fooled by the preproduction artwork for the film on Pendragon's web site. I was expecting quality work. When this film hit dvd and not the theatre I knew it was not a good sign. I bought a copy at WalMart, once I found one where the dvd hadn't come loose inside the case. When I sat through it, well, I was sickened and sadden at this atrocity. I do not like it when someone calls all the bad reviewers ""sourpusses"". We weren't expecting ILM-quality effects, but neither were we expecting old video game sfx. If you cannot produce quality effects than stay away from film subjects that must rely on cgi. Any effects-laden film production team will/should test the cgi waters first, to make certain they can pull it off. If Hines' fx team couldn't tell that their cgi shots did not work, if they actually thought their work was good, professional visual effects, then they have no business making cgi-based films. For 'War of the Worlds' to succeed and be accepted as quality filmmaking, every part of the production MUST work.

It all begins with the script. You cannot just film a novel. Adaptations are tough, but the screen writer must make choices (Even the superb 'Shogun' had artistic choices).  It is unforgivable that 45 minutes pass before the opening of the first pod in the pit. Forty-five minutes!

As previously mentioned by another viewer, I did notice the motion artifacts. I would like to know the format used by Hines. In all my years of shooting video I have never seen this kind of motion effect. I don't know if it is a result of a 24p shooting mode, bad transfer, the wrong editing software or what (We're currently using Avid Xpress DV and moving up to Avid Express Pro HD, so hopefully we won't have such artifacts).

Yes, the acting was over-the-top and below par in most cases, especially by the leads. The accents were passable at best, but I was floored when the artillery man mispronounced the very British ""aluminium"" as the American ""aluminum"" (note the extra ""i"" that differentiates the two). If you're doing a British film you have to pay attention to Briticisms.

Special effects should be used when there is no other way of accomplishing a shot. With the bad matting artifacts from the blue/green screen composites, why use virtual sets for basic interiors? They weren't clean and the scale did not match the actors. The night sky composite with the terrible day-for-night scenes early on when the writer is pointing out Mars to his wife are ludicrous. I have never seen a night sky like this. It looked like a deep space Hubble plate. The only comment I will make about the already criticized Thunderchild sequence is, besides the poor model work, that this is supposed to be a fast, torpedo ram vessle and yet the waves made by the 'fast ship' looked like a few brush strokes in a paint program. And the crashing tripod into the waters barely created a ripple. This is supposed to be a 100 foot tall war machine!

The music did have some merit but there were no developed themes; just background.

The sound mix did not exist. A foley of someone running across gravel sounded as if the microphone was dragged across the ground. There were no layering of sounds. The soundtrack was too quiet, as if most of the production was shot 'mit-out-sound'.

Well, I won't continue with bashing this film further. It has been done more thoroughly by so many before me. This and other negative reviews is not nit-picking. This film is nothing but nits and should be picked clean! I will conclude by urging people not to purchase this dvd. Rent it if you must. Find 10 friends and pitch in a buck, if you must. But you've read all the reviews, so be thee warned. And no, this isn't sour grapes. The fans of H.G. Wells and of 'The War of the Worlds' expected better than this and it wasn't delivered. Not by a long shot.",1118620800,19,4360,4.622739018087855
2312539,1,B0009PW4D2,"This film reminds me most of the old bad movie ""The Giant Claw"". In that movie, when they were filming it, the actors tried to react to a horrifying monster that hadn't been filmed yet and were embarrassed to see the premiere and the ""giant turkey"" monster that had been edited into the film.

The dialogue in the movie describes things like the book that weren't realized onscreen. The floating Martians (had to stop the film til I stopped laughing) were described as being sluggish and unable to get out of the pit, as one example. Over and over, the film tried and FAILED MISERABLY to show things that should have been highlights.

The design of the Martians and their machines were awful. The whirly gig heat ray was awful. The constant CGI usage for flames and other things that a real movie would have done LIVE was a perfect example for film schools of what NOT TO DO.

DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE: Rent it if you have to but you'll never watch it again and you'll fast forward through it the first time. I wish I HAD fast forwarded through it but then my brother and I made jokes about the walking... walking... falling down in exhaustion... getting up... walking... scenes and had a MST3K time with it.",1118534400,17,1205,4.468181818181818
2312540,4,B0009PW4D2,"My husband and I just saw this movie and it flowed in a dreamlike way like a beautiful painting. The colors were vivid and defined like an old musical or an epic like Cleopatra (but with less budget). The story was placed at the turn of the century, (from 1899 to 1900).Even though they talked about mars and a meteorite falling, the movie kind of lulled us into a sense of serenity. Then it suddenly changed and everybody was being attacked by alien invaders. It was fantastic. I don't usually like monster movies, but this movie was different. It made you feel sad about the monsters attacking. And it wasn't always so real that it overwhelmed you. Like in one scene when a man is scooped up in a monster machine's tentacle and thrown into the sky. You can tell it's special effects but it doesn't matter.

I spend much time at the Metropolitan Museum of Art when I visit New York City and this movie felt like paintings from the period it is depicting.

Very nice job. If you want a different kind of monster movie that is more like a moving painting, you should see this movie.",1118534400,73,1081,4.42713567839196
2312541,2,B0009PW4D2,"A little backstory before I review. In preparation for the release of the new Paramount War of the Worlds I decided to read the novel that the movie is based on. I enjoyed the book and knew that there was an older version of the movie out. While grabbing some things at Wal-Mart I saw The War of the Worlds on the shelf and bought it thinking it was the old one.

Boy, was I wrong.

Bearing in mind that I've only read the book once; I could see the painful lengths the director went through to ensure that the film was completely faithful to the source material. It is sad to say that is one of the few positive remarks I have about the movie.

For people who don't know the story it is a classic invasion movie. The Humans sitting fat, content, and comfortable on top of the world are suddenly knocked to the bottom of the food chain as Martains start arriving and cutting a swath through the countryside of late 1800's England. The story centers mostly on the main character (who is without name.) as he wanders about trying to survive. I won't spoil the ending on the movie (or book).

The acting in the movie was sub-par. With the exception of the soldier whom the main character runs into I don't think a single one of them stood out. The movie is set in England, but the accents are terrible. The production could have benefited from a dialect coach. The main character was written without a name, in my opinion, so that he could really be any one of us. For this movie to be successful I felt I needed to be put in the main character's shoes. The attempt was valiant, but fell short of the mark.

Most of the effects are bad, but I don't think they're so aweful that the film is unwatchable. Everything just seems rushed and not well thought out. The budget for the film must have been spent elsewhere because adding the CGI elements with real footage looked bad, and fully rendered scenes looked even worse. Green screen fuzz around some of the female characters hair is a good example of the effects not being well planned.

Where the film suffers the most is editing and directing. At a running time of about three hours it manages to almost bore you to sleep with the many scenes of the main character wandering the countreyside. The best example of the poor editing is the sequence where the Martains square off against a British battleship with helpless people watching from a ferry. The battle (which itself is perhaps the worse effects in the movie) is intercut with reaction shots from the cast. Another shot of the battle and another reaction shot. This is rinsed and repeated several times.

This film suffers because of it's greatest triumph. In making a straight adaptation of the book, the film becomes too long and bulky. Money spent on more film and time spent on the filming could have been redirected into streamlining the more important aspects of the movie. There is only so much wandering you need to see before you get it.

The real monsters in this film aren't Martians; its the long running time and poor editing/directing.

If you love the book, rent this and give it a look as you may appreciate the straight adaptation. I only recommend this movie to the die-hards, and I don't even recommend that they buy it. I rate The War of the Worlds at one star, but add another for the attempt of making a faithful piece.",1118534400,19,3347,4.46481178396072
2312542,5,B0009PW4D2,"I watched this movie with my boyfriend. I didn't want to but I'm glad I did. This movie made me feel something. Something awakened in me seeing it. With all the horrible monsters and giant machines attacking the Earth, this guy lives through it and makes it through. I felt like it was my story.

I think the people who reviewed this movie based on special effects or other things missed what this movie was saying and they probably will never know what I'm talking about.  But this movie touched me. It wasn't about special effects, although some were very gory and scary. It was about this guy making all these mistakes and still surviving in the end. And I felt what he felt. I lived his journey and it wasn't that different from my journey.

I can say if you ever tried to fight an uphill battle or had to face really hard problems, this movie will speak to you. If it doesn't you don't know what I'm talking about and should probably go see a different movie that is all about special effects or something. But for me, It was like it was telling my life.

My boyfriend was surprised how much this movie affected me and he liked it too but not in the same way I did.

I think everybody who has had hardship should see this movie. It really helped to put things in perspective for me.

I don't know alot about special effects but they seemed okay to me. I guess if that's all that matters to you, then you know more than me and probably have things to say about that.

But my sister and I were sent from home to home and that's what it was like for the main guy in this movie. I understand how hard it was for him to survive when the world is falling apart around you. I want her to see it too.

2312546,4,B0009PW4D2,"Pendragon Pictures' new film ""H G Wells' War of the Worlds"", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years. A theatrical release was intended for earlier this year (March, 2005) but this never happened. The DVD was rushed out to coincide with the release of Spielberg's film, which hits theatres June 29.

I liked this film, with certain reservations.

How faithful is the adaptation? It's not quite 100% faithful to Wells' book, but 90 - 95% faithful is good enough for me. At least several scenes were totally new, such as Ogilvy the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the unnamed writer/narrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin. But on the whole, this film follows the book very closely -- certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by George Pal.

Its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget. The majority of it seems to have been shot blue-screen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds. This is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots, and scenes of crowded city streets. The overviews of 1898 London look like something from a video game. Numerous scenes in horse-carriages were faked -- I guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse. The only scenes shot for ""real"" seem to be those in open fields or forests.

But within those budget restrictions, they managed to do quite a lot. Artistically, the film looks right. The Martians and their tripods are quite well done, and very true to Wells' descriptions. I was particularly impressed with the heat ray. Although the Thunder Child sequence, which should have been one of the film's highlights, is very disappointing. It's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets, or better quality animation.

The acting and direction won't win any Oscars. For the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. The music is quite good also, though not on a par with any of the major Hollywood composers.

I'm actually glad this didn't get a theatrical release, because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen. As it stands, I would rate this similarly to a BBC-TV adaptation of classic literature.

A few nitpicks:  Most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters (mostly red). This may have been an artistic choice, but it is used very inconsistently, and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the DVD. And the writer/narrator's obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scene.

Bottom line -- Is it worth seeing?

If you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations, and get into the story, I think you will enjoy this, especially if you've actually read the original H G Wells novel. And for only 10 bucks, you shouldn't feel cheated. If, however, you are easily put off by cheap production values, you'd best pass on this (unless you're a MST3K fan). Be warned, however that the film runs a full 3 hours, so I don't recommend watching it all in one sitting.

BTW: An entirely different version of War of the Worlds, aka ""INVASION"", is due on DVD June 28. This was also made on a budget, but is updated to the present day like the Spielberg film. And to top it off, Jeff Wayne is making an animated film of his best-selling album from 1978, but that won't be out until 2007.",1118361600,547,3342,4.764705882352941

Unfortunately, the acting and special effects are so poor that I found my self, after sitting through the the films entire 3 hour length (and only nodding off twice), still looking forward to a film that even remotely comes close to doing justice to the briliant tale that Wells put to paper more than a century ago.  As badly as I wanted to enjoy it, I couldn't help myself from being thouroghly annoyed by horribly mangled English accents, and a completely botched editing job.  The Thunderchild sequence is a complete embarrassment!  If you enjoy all things related to ""War of the Worlds"" you probabaly won't be able to help yourself from spending 9 dollars to see this fiasco (and at that price it's not too terrible a waste), but please don't bother watching it until you find yourself with absolutely nothing better to do with three hours of your time.

2312548,1,B0009PW4D2,"I  am a sucker for Victorian period pieces, seeing on screen Victorian damsels in their hats, lace and velvet makes my heart go putter, and I am a fan of Sci-fi so I thought I would check out this direct to video production that combines the two by staying faithful to the HG Wells novel. Also, the movie was selling at Wal-mart for $9, including sales tax so I said what the heck. There is only one word to describe this movie: HORRID.  The only redeeming quality is the director Timothy Hines makes an effort to produce an accurate portrayal of turn of the 19th century England from the women in their Victorian clothing to the uniforms of the soldiers to the 12 pounder artillery pieces. Hines tried to be cute in giving the movie a washed out tone as if this was some movie stored away and found recently although the tone is erratic from reddish , to green, to blue to no tone at all. Some of the emotional gestures reminds one of the acting one saw in early silent movies where you have the exaggerated facial expressions conveying emotions. That's about the only good things I can say about it. The acting is atrocious. Some of the scenes are funny in a bad way. For example, you see the narrator and his wife going for a walk during the day time but they are talking about the stars they see in what suppose to be a night sky. The CGI effects are so bad as if they were produced on a old Intel 486 computer. I have seen much better graphics on video games. The movie spends inordinate amount of time showing the narrator walking from point A to B in some non-descript countryside. I think if Hines shortened these walking scenes he would of cut the movie by a third from its 3 hour run time. (I watched the movie over a three day period since one would not be able to handle it on a single viewing.) The Thunderchild scene is awful. Instead of creating some mighty Victorian battleship the Thunderchild was a torpedo boat and one does not even see a single sailor on it. Its too bad the Sci-Fi channel and Masterpiece Theatre did not team up to produce an faithful version of World of the Wars. That would have been a much better production. I give it one star because it did have some pretty actresses dressed up in Victorian finery.

PS: I went over the 4 and 5 star reviews and there were only 5 reviews from Amazon.com customers who wrote reviews for other items. Amazon deleted all the reviews once before because of employees from Pendragon pictures spamming the site with fake reviews. I am sure the legitimate 4 or 5 star reviews are from people with different tastes. I would recommend checking whether a review seems to be from a legitimate Amazon.com customer. I do not work for or know anybody who works for Paramount Pictures, who got pissed off Pendragon is trying to piggy back off Spielberg's WOTW. So called fans of this DVD have charged that the poor reviews are being written by Paramount Pictures as a form of payback.

I'm glad I didn't pay very much for it because it is truly terrible. Some of the worst acting I have ever seen, if not THE worst. Visual effects that are completely laughable. Incredibly drawn out running time.

If Hines had said this is just a low budget labour of love made with the best intentions I might give it more credit, but for it to suddenly be ready for release just in time to cash in on the Spielberg version loses a lot of points with me.

I had heard it was awful, but I did want to  give it a chance, after all it's cheap. But after 3 nights of watching it I still haven't finished it. Partly because nothing happens for long periods of the movie, and partly because when it (unintentionally) makes you laugh so hard you spit beer everywhere, you have to take a break.

This movie is so bad Mike, Joel and the bots would beg for back to back Manos Hands of Fate instead.

This movie is LONG (heck the only thing that gets me through most bad movies is that they're 90 minutes or less!), special effects WORSE than any straight to video movie I've seen recently, and acting worse than your average pornographic film.  There is nothing redeeming about this film.  It was only a $8 and some change at my local store... and I returned it.

2312553,1,B0009PW4D2,"Here's my quick review:

I was going to make a long review of Tim Hines / Pendragon Film's H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds.  But you know what?  Trash doesn't take that long to review.

No don't get me wrong I don't mind a ""good"" B Sci-Fi flick.  Heck I settle for C and D ones every now and then, <grin>, but this is more like a Y or Z flick.

I am a fan of the old classic Sci-Fi films like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", ""Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers"", ""The Thing"", and the Pal version of ""War o the Worlds"".  So as you can see I don't let bad FX keep me from enjoying the movie.  Also I try not to let bad acting but good FX not let me enjoy it one either.

But Mr. Hine's flick has neither in my opinion.  The effects could have been done by ANY, and I do stress ANY first year graphic artist.  My pre-teen nephews could do about as good with Microsoft Paint.

Examples: Most of these examples will have already been mentioned by other's but I will mention them again because well frankly they are so truly bad that if you haven't seen the flick you just don't realize how bad....

1) The fact that in some scenes we are lead to believe that it is night, but clearly the scene was filmed in broad daylight.
2) The Heat Ray. The Heat Ray's use is NEVER consistent.  At the beginning it starts off by apparently only affecting people and their clothing.  People burst into flames (well small parts of them do anyway) and they fray about (if you can call it that) until suddenly they turn into skeletons.  But does it end there?  Nope, they actually start fraying about more as a bare skeleton than they did when they had Skin and muscle surrounding bone.  Ever seen a skeleton thrash around in pain?  Well it's almost painful to watch in itself.
3) As mentioned, the Heat Ray is not consistent.  The first scene we see it cooking only the people alive (and maybe a tree here or there) but then suddenly it just starts blowing things up.  We see houses (look more like a clay models) being blown up and then we start even seeing people being blown up.  It's almost like they saw the Paramount explosions and Hines said to his staff, ""No let's make things explode"".
4) Way, Way too much green screen crap.  Just because you can green screen a horse pulling your stars around, doesn't mean you should.  Every time I saw a horse or person walking in the distance I laughed out loud.  It is truly pitiful and hard to watch just how bad their CGI looks.
5) The Tripods.  Well to me they just look plain stupid.  Their tentacles are WAY too large for the rest of the tripod.  They never held to scale.  As mentioned elsewhere they tended to just glide along the surface and usually never even touched the ground.  They weren't scary looking at all.
6) The use of Black Smoke was comical.  It was more like ""very un scary dark mist"".
7) Red Weed.  It was more like Red Blobs.  Another example of very poor CGI and in fact even a place where CGI wasn't needed.  Paramount proves that some things are better just being real.
8) The Acting.  It was pretty rough, but comical at times.  Though it was laughable, had it not been for the horrible CGI this movie might have been almost entertaining.
9) The gore scenes where supposed to invoke fear, but instead they invoke laughter.
10) And finally the biggest joke to me, and others it would sound was the Thunderchild and the Ferry.  They both skirted across the water like they were being pushed.  Actually the Ferry moved at one point like it had a freaking rocket pushing it.

All in all I must say, even though it is a $9.00 flick, don't waste the $9.00 on it.  I thought hey it would be worth the $9.00 for a laugh, but it is so bad that you are going to want to cry as much as you want to laugh.

This was CLEARLY just a ploy to cash in on the current ""War of the Worlds"" crazy.  Period piece or not, it is a joke and if Mr. Hines EVER is given money to produce and direct a film before, I want to meet the investor, because they must be in the business of throwing good money away.

In closing I do have one good thing to say about this MS3TK worthy flick.  They do keep for the most part to the book.  There are some scenes as mentioned before like the rape / blood draining scene with the rag doll that aren't true to the book, but other than that, we are given pretty much word for word the book.  Of course that is most likely not because Hines is a purist but because he was too lazy to think for himself.

*Update*  I forgot to mention that about 1/2 of this 3 hour film is just of people walking back and forth.  Most of the time with very, very little to no dialog during these extended walking scenes.",1118275200,22,4658,4.1856017997750286
2312554,1,B0009PW4D2,"Like most, I had been keeping up with this project since the pre-911 days when this was going to be a present day piece.

I watched the trailers that had come out in the past year with the Big Ben floating sequence being in one of them.

I bought this last weekend from Wal-mart due to some snafu from Pendragon's distributor, UAV.

This movie is 3 hours long. After watching it, it becomes apparent that nothing was left out that was shot. There are so many scenes of the writer walking down paths that the movie could be shortened to at least half that running time. The sepia tone that was talked about being used is done haphazardly. With scenes not having it all, to overly saturated. There are also scenes that look like they were edited in last minute with poorly shot grainy video.

The acting is what you would expect from stage actors which was good, with the exception of the producer who get's the role of the writer's wife probably because it was promised to get funding.

Probably the best acting was during the ruined house scene with the Curate and the writer.

The musical score was actually the best thing in the movie, but, it was overly used and their wasn't much of a variety. There is probably about 4 different tracks through the whole movie, and one of them is during the ending rolling credits!

No, the one thing that this movie will be remembered for is the promised ""Matrix like SFX"" from it's director. He forgot to tell that to his SFX crew because most of the SFX shots are unfinished or look like what SFX houses use for ""storyboarding"" sequences.

The Thunderchild scene comes off as the worst offender. A scene that could of saved this film, possibly, was wasted with no sense of why this was taking place. Poorly CG renderings of the ship and not a soul shown onboard were just one. No, I take that back. There is the scene when the ship is sinking and two Lego men are sliding down the railings! This whole sequence will have you laughing so much you'll forget the next 30 minutes of the film which is when the floating Big Ben sequences comes in. Not only is that totally geographically inaccurate but the way it was caused was also suspect as we see a lighting bolt or ray different from the rest of the heat ray sequences blasts it from it's spot.

Also during that 30 minute time span is the totally absurd blood draining sequence of first a blob for a bull and the singer (seen in one of the trailers) changing from a real person to a CG rendered Goth Barbie, complete with garters.

The Dead London sequence consists of one dead girl sitting on a window ledge that commited suicide.

I think you get the picture.

If you like really bad movies, like the ones seen on Mystery Science Theater, then you'll adore this movie. If you were expecting more then I wouldn't recommend it.",1118275200,20,2820,4.4437984496124034
2312555,1,B0009PW4D2,"Ernest? Yes, I'll give it that. Faithful to Wells's novel? Well, umm, yes--but in decidedly wrong-headed, (and all too frequently) unintended comical ways. A film in which those involved can be proud? Oh, sure...but only if you're operating on the same level of self-delusion as that late, great film _enfant terribe_ of Le Bad Cinema, Ed Wood. So, friends, because of its' famous literary lineage, you can count on this amateurish, frequently embarrassing, and half-baked direct-to-video production of one of the world's truly great novels living on and on (gorge rising), having immediately joined the exhalted ranks of the Worst Films of All Time. Another high example of that very low art form, it's director a new Ed Wood for the digital age. Mr. Wells would be ever so proud...",1118275200,18,783,5.030769230769231
2312556,5,B0009PW4D2,"Let me first state that I do not in any way represent Pendragon

Pictures. I happened to enjoy this version of H.G.Wells' The War of the Worlds simply because Tim Hines chose to go back to the original source material found in the book. The aliens looked cool in a Jim Danforth style kinda way. The cinemaphotography was even interesting. Tim Hines photographed the whole film to look like a pre-World War 2 newsreel documentary colorized, complete with bits of jerkiness of movements. Just like the book, the film is set in 1898.

I really feel sorry for all the sour pusses out there spoiled rotten by mega budgets, heavy doses of CGI and thin storytelling. Tim Hines' War of the Worlds is very cool. Check it out.",1118275200,487,716,4.5859375
2312557,1,B0009PW4D2,"I'm going to be honest with you. I went out for a night on the town and ended up drinking too much. Last thing I remember, I was singing a karoake version of Kenny Roger's megahit ""lady"" in the basement of a local freemason. That's the last thing I remember. When I awoke in the morning, I was aghast to find myself nude and painted blue, with a Llama eating grass in my backyard. Even worse, I had this movie superglued to my right bicep. I decided to watch it. mistake!

Let me point out that I am not a filmaker. I know it is very easy to criticise what other people have created, but much more difficult to actually create something. I do not know anything about how to write a movie script, or what a gaffer does, or any of that. All I know is what I like to watch. One thing I do not like watching is a man with a mustache that can only be described as ""retarded"" running, walking, and biking all over a fake british countryside. But friends, that is what you get. You could take half the footage from this ""film"" and make a documentary on how to use your feet and legs for locomotion purposes. The rest of the movie could then be spliced together and shown to people you don't like for revenge purposes.

Holy balls. What can I say that hasn't been said before by the other unfortunates who have witnessed this movie? I used to judge movies based on a simple schematic. A good movie is one that is near the brilliance of such films as Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, and Dolemite. A bad movie is one that would rank somwhere in the vicinity of House of the Dead. Guess what? House of the Dead is better than this movie. we have a new bottom of the barrel DVD! On a scale of one through ten, ten being the highest, and one being the lowest, this movie gets an F-.

On the upside, I did throw up while watching this, which made my hangover abate somewhat. Also, I did watch the whole thing, and seeing as this movie is about thirteen hours long, my hangover had actually gone away by the time it was over(I am the kind of guy who looks for a silver lining).

In summation, I must advise that every single person on earth not watch this movie. Don't watch it to make fun of it. Don't watch it to see skeletons on fire that magically thrash around even though their muscles are absent. Don't watch it to see the sweet acting during the Thunderchild sequence. And most of all, don't watch it just because it's glued to your bicep. This isn't Russia, so people have rights, and that includes the right to not watch movies like this.

Man, this makes Gigli look good.",1118275200,16,2564,4.245901639344262
2312558,1,B0009PW4D2,"Its' only June , but Pendragon's ""HG Wells War Of The Worlds"" is already a lock for the worst movie of 2005. It is an embarrassment. It makes the films of Uwe Boll look good. And I never thought I would say that about any film. It has already earned the nickname of ""Plan 9 From Mars"", in honor of the Ed Wood Classic.
Almost everything about this film is laughably bad. The acting is horrible. The editing is atrocious. The photography is a outrage. The direction is non existence. But it is the SFX that linger  in the memory.
Yes, it follows HG Wells novel closely. Yes, it has the Victorian setting.  But all that does not count compared to the sheer incompetence of this film.
And we know who to blame. Timothy Hines is the writer, editor, director, and Exec producer.
He was also the head of marketing and publicity, which is why, along with it wretched quality, this film is a direct to El Cheapo DVD instead of a ""worldwide theatrical release "" as Tim Hines, promised. He also promised a lot of other things like ""Special Effects  Better then The Matrix"" and ""Anthony Piana (The ""Actor"" who has the main lead) is the Next Al Pacino"". In the words of one of Pacino's better known Characters ""Forgetaboutit"".
The SFX are so poorly done that most fan films would be ashamed of them. The CGI work is so bad it looks like crappy work using other SFX methods. The exploding houses look like bad ,fake, miniatures. The Martian Fighting machines look like bad stop action models.  When the Martians emerge form the Cylinder for the first time, it is meant to be a horrifying  moment but instead Hilarity ensues. Marvin The Martian from the Warner Brs. Cartoons is a lot more frightening.
In fact the laughs to be had from the sheer ineptness of it all is the only redeeming thing about the film.
I take that back, The Music is pretty good. But it only emphasizes what a freaking amateur night operation the rest of the film is.
The effects of the Heat Ray are shown by badly superimposed fire over the bodies of scenery chewing actors turning to fake looking skeletons. The CGI for the skyline of London looks like cheap cardboard cut outs. There is one of the fakest looking train wrecks in History. When a Martian grabs a human and throws it  to his doom it looks like a scene from ""Monty Python And The Holy Grail"". The movement of the Martian fighting machines makes them look like they are doing the Funky Chicken. But the acme is reached in the Thunderchild scene.
This is where a British Naval ships battles the Martian Tripods. It's hard to describe just how bad this scene is. Let's just say that The Flying Saucers in Ed Wood's ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" now have competition for the most ridiculous special effects of all time. If Hines had  taken a toy battleship and shot the scene in the bathtub it would have looked better then the inept CGI in the film.
The ""Acting"" ranges from poor to incredibly bad. Bring a Jar of Mustard with you because you will need it with all the Ham on screen. The love scenes between the Main Character and his wife make you long for the brilliance of the Padme/Anakin love scenes in ""Attack Of The Clones"".
And the British accents are so bad that Dick Van Dyke in ""Mary Poppins"" laughs at them.  They would be rejected as substandard at any self respecting Renaissance Fair.
The costuming seems to take in anything that is  vaguely Victorian. My wife is a historical costumer of 15 years experience, and she pointed out dresses that go from 1850 to 1912 in the film.
Hines has no concept of how to Edit a film. A good half hour at least of footage if of the main character wandering around the English Countryside, played unconvincingly by the state of Washington, until in interest of Sanity you fast forward.
And then Hines blows one of the great potential scenes in the film: The Main Character wandering through Dead London. We get one shot of a women who has committed suicide out of despair, and that is it. It then cuts to more of Piana wandering around the English Countryside.
The only way I can recommend this film is from a so bad it's unintentionally funny  viewpoint. I have to admit that a good deal of it is screamingly funny. The first Martian attack and the Thunderchild Scene are laugh riots. But so much of the film is boring that I can only recommend if you watch it keep your finger on the fast forward of your remote.
At one point, Hines was making accusations that he was being Harassed by Stephan Spielberg and  Paramount because his project posed a threat to the Spielberg WOTW. The only threat is than Spielberg injures himself from laughing at this piece of drek.
I give this one star because it is the lowest I can give it here at Amazon. It really deserves no  stars.

The story line stays very much in line with the writings of H.G. Wells, and the props and special effects are primitive to what is available in studios of today. But to me that adds character to the production and takes you to a world as viewed  by the citizens of the late 1800's and early 1900's.

The average movie goer wanting the flash,bang, fast action of modern science fiction may get bored with it, but I think a true fan of H.G.Wells or a partaker of ""Steampunk"" roll playing would take it as presented, a futuristic science fiction story at the change of the last centuries.

This product was good. However, the special effects are on an elementary school level. No force field here to protect the crummy Martian invaders.
