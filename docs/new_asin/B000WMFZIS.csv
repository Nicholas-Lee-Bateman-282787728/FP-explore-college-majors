8224095,4,B000WMFZIS,"My dog watches TV, and when she seems bored, I put this on for her.  She bites at the TV, barks, gets out her toys, and plays along with them.  I should say she doesn't bother with real dogs which she sees everyday, so please don't think she's not being socialized, they're OK, but she just loves the TV and this works.  After about 15 minutes, she's had enough, and goes about her business, usually a nap.  I think it gives her a lot of mental stimulation and excercise.",1406764800,,471,4.258426966292135
8224096,3,B000WMFZIS,It is OK for a while but it get's boring watching the same dogs doing the same thing. Not what I thought it would be.,1397260800,,117,3.72
8224097,5,B000WMFZIS,"Or a well friend, too. It's hilarious with puppies playing on a pretend football field with real sound effects like cheering at touchdowns and so forth. Halftime is also hilarious, with lots of kittens playing, pushing each other around, hitting at tinsel and shiny things hung over them. Very cute indeed.",1387238400,,306,5.019607843137255
8224098,4,B000WMFZIS,"My grand-daughter loves the puppies and kitties. I like the Harry Kalas narration.  Good for little kids, with short attention spans, a few minutes of puppy play is a great distraction.",1366502400,,185,4.967741935483871
8224099,5,B000WMFZIS,"Woof!  I can't translate exactly, but I'm sure it's positive comments from my nine month old Border Terrier.  He watches it and does make comments.  Woof woof woof.  It works for him so it works for me.  As I don't have cable, I've never seen a Puppy Bowl before.  Hardly anything cuter than a bowl full of puppies.  If you're curious about breeds, there's a line-up of puppies' breeds, ages, and names.",1327881600,4,403,4.513888888888889
8224100,4,B000WMFZIS,"ok the half time show is cats. for us grown up this gets old quick, for the yunguns they watch it over and over and over and over. ""what do you want to watch?"" ""puppies"" ""puppies"".....LOL",1307404800,3,187,4.222222222222222
8224101,5,B000WMFZIS,"I bought this as a present for a friend. We both love to watch the puppy bowl on Animal Planet during the Super Bowl. I picked this one because Harry Kalas narrated it.  He was the voice of the Philadelphia Phillies and he died last year. As a Phillies fan, it was great to hear his voice again.",1264809600,5,295,4.086206896551724
