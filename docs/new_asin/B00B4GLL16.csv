8562293,5,B00B4GLL16,"This is one great collection of movies and documentaries. I bought this for $5 as most places are dumping dvds and I love any
kind of WWII and Nazi movies and docs. I was surprised how good this collection is. If your a collector like I am and love movies
like Schindler's List, Fatherland, Conspiracy, Holocaust, Hitler's SS etc...then this is the collection for you. I think everyone of these
movies are as good or even better than Hollyweird's movies. I believe most of these are Canadian movies. The movie I thought
would not be so good was the best which is Hidden in Silence. A german girl helps a jewish family and others to escape the ghetto
and she hides them in her attic while working for the Nazis. Second was Passchendaele which seems to be a love story but that
is a small part which adds to the rest of the movie which is one of the best WWI battle scenes I've ever seen in a movie. You think
your right in the middle of the action. The next and probably most known movie is Sobibor with Hauer and Arkin which is about the
concentration camp and the great escape. It is one of the best ever made. The next one Firing Squad surprised me because at
first it looks dull and cheap but after a few minutes the story catches you and it's hard to not finish watching it. The ending was a
surprise to me since I didn't know the story. All of these are based on true stories. The final one Regeneration I haven't finished
and my least favorite but still a good movie. All of the documentaries are first rate and some of the best I've ever seen and should
be seen by anyone who knows very little or nothing about the Nazis and the Holocaust and the first two World Wars! Brilliant.",1413331200,,1686,4.2884012539184955
