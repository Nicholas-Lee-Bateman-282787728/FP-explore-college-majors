413819,5,6302032245,"One of the best westerns ever made, RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY comes as a surprise to anyone who believes that Sam Peckinpah could only produce blood and gore in his films.  Delicate, literate, and moving, RIDE THE HIGH  COUNTRY effectively blends adventure, excitement, and morality,  particularly through the central character, Steve Judd (who is  representational of Peckinpah's father).  Biblical references and metaphors  abound, pulling the viewer into the actions and dilemmas of the main  characters.  Peckinpah's debut feature film, RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY  introduces several actors who became part of the Peckinpah Road Company: R.  G. Armstrong, John Davis Chandler, L. Q Jones, and (best of all) Warren  Oates.  These actors would appear in numerous Peckinpah films.  RIDE THE  HIGH COUNTRY is a must see.

413821,5,6302032245,"Joel McCrae stars as Steve Judd, an ageing lawman reduced to taking odd jobs in the rapidly civilizing west of the late 1890s.  Taking a job transporting gold from a violent mining camp in the High Sierras, Judd hires two men to help in the job, one a friend(Randolph Scott) from law days gone by.  The two assistants plot to steal the gold as soon as they are hired and the action gets thick from there.  Vital to this movie is the display of Judd's moral code.  Judd may be a man just barely hanging on, a supurfluous man in the New West, but he's kept his manly virtues- his strength of character, his wisdom, his courage, and his dignity.  However humbled by his circumstances, Judd is a man worthy of emulation. He is a true hero.  END",887846400,10,740,4.326086956521739

The story is about a down on his luck lawman, Joel McCrea, now having to work for two sleazy bankers to earn a living. His job is to collect gold from miners high up in the mountains and return it to the bankers.
This job calls for more than one man and he recruits his friend, Randolph Scott, to assist him bring in the gold. The story then becomes an interplay
between these two men in their struggle for integrity in doing what is right or greed. It's is what I believe is Sam Peckinpah's greatest films. The cowboy ideals live on.",1501459200,2,775,4.27891156462585

413975,5,6302032245,"Released in 1962, Ride the High Country was Sam Peckinpahs second feature film and arguably his best Western; yes, better than the overrated ""Wild Bunch"" (1969). While it lacks that movie's slow-motion ultra-violence, it has a superior story and more interesting characters.

BASIC PLOT: Too aging ex-lawmen and old friends take a job transporting a gold shipment from a mountain mining settlement to the bank in the town below. One is a man of integrity (Joel McCrea) while the other has compromised his (Randolph Scott). Can he be redeemed? And at what cost? What about his young mentee (Ron Starr)?

The conflict between puritanical religion and purity of purpose is spotlighted with Elsa's curmudgeonly father representing the former and Judd (McCrea) the latter.

Yet there's so much more, like the five redneck brothers from hell at the wild mining camp, not to mention Mariette Hartley (Elsa) in her debut. The movie's short at 94 minutes, but seems longer (in a good way) because it's so dense with gems to mine, like Elsa's brief discussion with Judd:

ELSA: ""My father says there's only right and wrong, good and evil; nothing in between. It isn't that simple, is it?""

JUDD: ""No, it isn't. It should be, but it isn't.""

Elsa flees the stifling clutches of her legalistic father to marry some young buck at the hedonistic frontier camp. Shes swings on the pendulum from legalism to libertinism, which is the opposite extreme, but they're actually two sides of the same bad coin. Judd represents the sound middle path of wisdom. Everyone near him recognizes this and is positively influenced by him, one way or another, even his old wayward friend. Kudos to the genius of writer N.B. Stone Jr.

Both Scott and McCrea retired from acting after this winner, although the latter decided to return several years later. Some say Ride the High Country represents the non-official end of the traditional Western and the beginning of the new.

The film was shot in Inyo National Forest, Malibu Creek State Park, Merrimac & Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park, California.

414044,4,6302032245,"""Ride The High Country""from Sam Peckinpah remains a transitional work--reflecting both the traditional western and featuring elements of his future film work. Made after the disasterous experience he had with ""The Deadly Companions"" (it was his first job as a film director and he was suggested by star Brian Keith) where he had no control over the script or editing of the film. He also had a difficult relationship with star Maureen O'Hara. The location shoot and small budget couldn't have made things any better for Peckinpah.

Former lawman Steve Judd (Joel McCrea) hires his former partner Gil Westrum (Randolph Scott) to help him escort gold from a mining camp. Gil brings along his partner Heck (Ron Starr) with plans to rob Steve at the earliest opportunity. The trio end up escorting Else (Marriett Hartley) to the camp as well where she plans on marrying one of the miners (James Drury)  against her father's wishes. Needless to say, things do not go quite as planned for any of them.

Peckinpah had vowed not to make another movie unless he had control over the editing and the opportunity to rewrite the script as needed. For ""Ride"" he had that co trol along with two western veterans who Gave nicely nuanced performers as the aging lawmen find themselves increasingly out-of-step and losing the very abilities that made them successful in the first place. ""Ride"" would pave the way for Peckinpah's later films ""Major Dundee"", The Wild Bunch"" and ""The Ballad of Cavle Hogan"" among other films.

Nicely restored by Warner Archive, ""Ride The High Country"" looks exceptionally good in its debut on Blu-ray. Colors aren't quite as saturated as I expected but it's a marked improvement over the pan and scan version that I saw ages ago with its duller colors and lack of depth and detail. Due to the changes in film stocks, processing, etc. the film shouldn't look saturated like an early 3 strip Technicolor film so this appears about right for the time. The credits are window boxed at the beginning of the film this, perhaps, has to do with the fact that the film was presented in a slightly different aspect ratio (2.35:1) when it was in theaters originally. The aspect ratio is 2.40:1 for the rest of the film.

The dialog sounds clear and upfront but sound effects are a bit ""thin"" sounding. That's not the fault of Warner but the original recording where the sound effects weren't very robust to begin with.

Warner has done a nice job of importing the special features from the original DVD. We get the Nick Redman directed featurette on Peckinpah. We also get a solid commentary track from Redman along with Paul Seydor, David Weddle and Garnet Simmons all experts on the director's work. These are rounded out by the theatrical trailer.

This is an excellent restoration of an important early work by Peckinpah. Warner Archive hita home run with this restoration.",1491696000,16,2881,4.84349593495935

414257,4,6302032245,"Peckinpah's second feature film, it was the one that gained him directorial notoriety. Within the Western genre and its evolution in the latter half of the 20th Century, Ride the High Country is in the cross-over between the classic John Ford Western and the revisionist sparked by the import of Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy with Clint Eastwood, the flawed anti-hero with no name. It's was also made before Peckinpah's self-destructive drug abuse and behavior ruined his reputation in Hollywood. Here we have a clean, early Peckinpah movie showing his skill and genius in telling a story. It's without the studio meddling that butchered most of his later films so badly, destroying the original director's cut and the scenes excised from it, so that we'll never know what his original intent was, only getting glimmers of it. The plot is clean and straightforward, with background and character development given as the story unfolds, without bogging the pacing down. The acting is excellent, giving the characters credibility as real people, complete with temptations and character imperfections. Ultimately we get to see personal values and loyalty to others come to the fore by the end of the movie, which isn't quite an ""everyone lives happily ever after"" ride into the sunset.

That's what differentiates this movie from the classic High Noon, Stagecoach, or the original 3:10 to Yuma (not the remake) type Western. Some of the principal characters are flawed. The White Hat Good Guys and Black Hat Bad Guys are not so easily differentiated. When viewing it, please remember it was released in 1962, under the MPAA's Draconian ""one size fits all"" Hays Code censorship rules that either approved a movie and issued it a numbered certificate, or effectively banned it by refusing to approve it (theaters refused to show movies that weren't MPAA ""approved""). How sex, language and violence are depicted, and how the ending is portrayed in the script all reflect this. I'd give it a soft PG-13 under the tiered MPAA rating system today. It's not his later ""Wild Bunch"" (which would never have passed the MPAA in 1962) but it has some mature themes and it isn't a Hopalong Cassidy or Roy Rogers movie either.",1434240000,19,2210,5.021798365122616

Featuring a  backdrop of the still so beautiful western mountain scenery that made men want to go west - contrasted by the grungy hard-scrabble gold mining camps of the latter 19th century.
Sam Peckinpah's direction builds and holds the suspense and helps to insure that Joel McCrea's final scene in this movie with Randolph Scott made the perfect ending to a great film career; this was his McCrea's last film with critical acclaim, making just a few more westerns in the latter 60's and early 70's with his son Jody.",1431734400,4,793,4.823529411764706

414407,5,6302032245,"Sam Peckinpah's 1962 ""Ride the High Country"" interested me after his ""Major Dundee,"" filmed a few years later, came as a bit of a disappointment.  This movie is perhaps less ambitious -- it's almost domestic in its focus -- and it's certainly more successful.  The action takes place around 1900, and we know from the opening scene (the one that includes the camel) that this isn't ""the old West"" -- there are policemen in uniform and a motor car, which almost runs down Joel McCrea when he enters on horseback.  He's an old lawman (McCrea was 57 when the movie was made) who, we learn later, has been reduced to being a bouncer in bars after a distinguished career as a Marshal.  He meets one of his old buddies, Gil Westrum, played by then 64-year-old Randolph Scott, working in a carnival in something like a Buffalo Bill outfit.  McCrea's character, Steve Judd, is looking for help to undertake a rather dangerous job he has signed up for -- bringing gold back from a mining camp in the California high country to the bank in the town of Hornitos.  He accepts the help of Gil's young associate Heck Longtree (Ron Starr), and it soon becomes clear that Gil and Heck think that they can convince Steve to take the gold and run -- but they can't, which leads to some interesting situations later as they run up against Steve's sense of justice and honor, still firmly held despite the decline in his fortunes.

However, an important part of the plot concerns their efforts to help a young woman, Elsa Knudsen (Mariette Hartley), escape from a bad marriage -- on the day of her wedding!  Elsa had run off to the mining camp to marry Billy Hammond (James Drury), mainly to escape her creepily tyrannical father, but she finds to her horror that as Billy's wife she will probably also become the sex slave of his four brothers too.  Peckinpah very deftly blends senses of uneasiness, horror, and even comedy in the scenes leading up to and including the wedding, where Elsa's rape becomes a real possibility.  The wedding takes place in the camp whorehouse, and the spirited yet inexperienced Elsa suddenly realizes what is expected of her.  But Steve and Gil step in and effect her rescue, only to be trailed down the mountain by the Hammond brothers to a shoot-out at Elsa's father's farm, where the Hammonds have set up an ambush.  Like an aging Butch and Sundance, Steve and Gil decide to face the Hammonds as they would have in their glory days, and they do what they have to do, but at a cost (I'm avoiding spoilers).  There's something funny about old men deploring the passage of time and the good old values.  There's a touch of Don Quixote ridiculousness about it, and Peckinpah doesn't shy away from that.  But that humor can blend with something sad and touching too -- the end of a life, the end of a way of life, and maybe the end of a way of imagining.  In this Western, bullets kill, but most of them miss -- and not just the bad guys' ones.  And Steve's sense of honor is real too -- it's not just a ""Western"" value -- and McCrea and Scott bring a sense of something important being at stake when they engage issues of trust, loyalty, and honor in a world in which they don't earn nearly as much as they used to.

The movie looks good -- lovely natural scenery, with nothing generic about it.  Horses have to be walked uphill in some places. The writing is unobtrusively right.  The old stars are wonderful; the young couple perhaps don't totally escape cliche, but they are appealing nonetheless, and the Hammond brothers are as scuzzy and unsavory a bunch as you could wish to meet, with their own peculiar sense of honor, which proves their undoing at the end.  Good stuff.",1400889600,,3691,4.536953242835596

That is how I found the movie, ""Ride the High Country""!  I remember the cowboy ""oat-burners"" that veteran actors Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott turned up in many years ago. This movie was their last hurrah....and it is a triumph!  Age is evident in every fiber of their being, but experience overcomes this.  They are perfect playing good against evil....in a background story riddled with every horror of life.  Name it, it is there...greed, killing, debauchery, moral decay, prostitution, thievery, and just plain stupidity.  The cast is wonderful.  In addition to McCrea and Scott,  there are the veteran character actors whose names often are forgotten, but whose faces we know so well.  Warren Oates, John Anderson, R.G. Armstrong, and L.Q. Jones.  There is Mariette Hartley in her first screen role..and a young man named Ron Starr who does a good job with his role.  And then, there is James Drury (known for his Virginian role), who is just great as the perverted son who marries Hartley.  The film started slowly and I thought about giving up on it, but decided to wait and see for a bit.  Then the story evolved and developed...rich with a beautiful background locale and acting characterizations that brought it to life.  It is worth seeing...it is a classic one should not miss.  Sam Peckinpah pulled this together to create more than just a western film...it is a story...not easy to digest, but one that should be told and seen as it happens.

414460,5,6302032245,"I love movies that jar the viewer.  Randolf Scott, who, by Hollywood tradition, is the definition of the straight shooting'  good-guy cowboy,  morphs into a complex character--a 'bad guy'--in this fascinating film. Interestingly, it was also the last film in Randolf's career and can be compared favorably with John Wayne's last film ""The Shootist"" in which Wayne plays a not so ""good guy"" dying of cancer.

Randolf, who has been a law man during much of his life, has fallen on hard times.  He is a ""Carnie"" who works for a traveling show.  He cons people during shooting contests.  Contestants shoot real bullets whereas Randolf shoots bird shot, increasing the chance of winning hits.  Joel McCrea, an old lawman parter passes through town with an offer to pay the aging Randolf to guard for a gold shipment coming from Corsco, a mining boom town.  Randolf accepts, but his reasons are entirely ulterior.  He subtly suggests that the moralistic McCrea join his thieving scheme but with no success.

The remainder of the film goes from comical to grim.  There is the usual romantic interest; a wedding in a Cat House; flight of the terrified bride; and McCrea's discovery that his good old friend is just a common thief.

414508,5,6302032245,"If one must have a swan song, for an actor, 1962's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY isn't at all a bad way to go out. It's only Sam Peckinpah's second feature film, some years before he'd become this mercurial, controversial figure. Word has it that the film's two stars, McCrea and Scott, got along famously with Peckinpah. Supporting actor James Drury reminisces: ""He (Peckinpah) had a tremendous amount of respect for McCrea and Scott and they had a lot of respect for him. They were pleased to be working in the picture. At that point, he was a happy man. We knew him at his best and most likable.""

Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott originally had the other's part until they decided to swap. Their gunfighting characters renew acquaintainces in their twilight years when ex-federal marshal Steve Judd (McCrea) rides into town during a carnival and runs into his old deputy Gil Westrum (Scott) who's hard at work trying to entice customers to his shooting gallery.

Judd nowadays is an independent security contractor. He's enroute to transport $20,000 in gold bullion from a mining camp to the bank. He tells Westrum that he's looking for backup for his escort duty. I guess that shooting gallery isn't much of a windfall 'cause here's the old deputy rarin' to sign on with Judd for $10 a day. He brings along a headstrong youngster (Ron Starr), never mind that Judd doesn't have a high opinion of this new generation's crop. He observes: ""Boys nowadays. No pride, no self-respect. Plenty of gall but no sand."" Not even the kid's winning horse races on a camel impresses him.

McCrea and Scott have each starred in their share of westerns, never mind that, of the two, McCrea's had the more striking film career. RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY is so good that both actors pretty much decided to hang it up afterwards, although McCrea would later resurface in a string of forgettable oaters. In 1962 it says something about MGM's ability to discern good cinema that It readily consigned RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY to play the back end of theater double features. Except that quality will out, and enough credible critics went on to rave about the film. Down the years it's come to be regarded as one of the best ever westerns.

It bridges the period in which the western genre transitioned to its darker, grittier identity. Peckinpah's trademark screen violence is toned down here. Instead he introduces what would become a recurring theme in his pictures: the decline of the Old West. Peckinpah deglamorizes the American West. Here he injects an unflinching look at how frontier life was lived back in the day, when aging gunmen scrambled for purpose and mining camps were populated by barbaric men, inebriated pastors, and worn-down harlots.

There's a wistful poetry to this film, its expert execution in acting and direction and narrative all combining to serve up a classic, elegiac movie experience. I won't go on any more about the plot, although you may be able to suss out the gist of the central conflict with this character-defining exchange between the two leads:

- Westrum: ""Do you know what's on the back of a poor man when he dies? The clothes of pride. They're not a bit warmer to him dead than alive. Is that what you want, Steve?""
- Judd: ""All I want is to enter my house justified.""

414624,5,6302032245,"The Western has always been the most traditional, and most definitively American of all film genres, even into the 1960s, when the more bizarre Italian spaghetti western sub-genre entered into the picture.  But up until that turbulent decade, with a number of notable exceptions, most Westerns were still mostly modeled off of the John Wayne variety: slack-jawed heroism; a clear definition of what right and wrong were; Indians as savages; and all the rest.  The decade of the civil rights and anti-war movements changed all of that; and one such film to initiate those changes was the 1962 Sam Peckinpah-directed film RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY.

On only his second film (after 1961's THE DEADLY COMPANIONS), Peckinpah was not only showing himself to be the true successor to John Ford when it came to the Western genre, but also as one of the top filmmakers of the era, period.  In RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY, veteran Western actors Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea star as two aging ex-lawmen who are given one last assignment to get a gold shipment out of the Sierra Nevada mining community of Coarsegold down to a bank in the flatlands.  McCrea's motivation is for self-respect; as he says famously to his partner, his only want is ""to enter my house justified.""  But Scott, who has fallen on harder times than his partner, is planning, alongside with a neophyte cohort (Ron Starr), to steal the gold for himself.  Combined with a young woman (Mariette Hartley, in her film debut) trying to escape from her Christian fundamentalist father (R.G. Armstrong), and a pack of rednecks called the Hammond Brothers, and what we have is a morality tale in which good and bad, right and wrong, black and white cannot be so easily delineated as they have been before.  It also causes Scott to rethink his greedy behavior and aid McCrea at the climactic shootout.

Given the slightly traumatic circumstances of production (the location shoot near Mammoth Lakes, California was abandoned after only four days because of an early-season snowstorm in the fall of 1961, necessitating completion of the film in the Santa Monica Mountains, near Los Angeles), a low budget, and a director whose work largely lay in television up to that point, RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY is nevertheless still a tremendous piece, with Scott and McCrea showing themselves to still be able to ride tall in the saddle (McCrea's role is said to have been modeled off of Peckinpah's father, who had died only one year before he made HIGH COUNTRY).  Warren Oates, L.Q. Jones, John Davis Chandler, James Drury, and John Anderson also do good turns as the villainous Hammonds (Oates, Jones, and Chandler would become part of the Usual Suspects that would make up Peckinpah's stock company of actors in his later films); and Armstrong, another soon-to-be Peckinpah regular, blazes with fundamentalist fire as Hartley's religiously-obsessed father.

The superb widescreen photography of Lucien Ballard, who would later work with Peckinpah on his magisterial 1969 epic THE WILD BUNCH, was the icing on the cake of this film, which pretty much marked the end of the traditional western as we had known it, and the beginning of a time in which the theme of changing times would be the defining one for the rest of the century.  Along with Stanley Kubrick's LOLITA and John Frankenheimer's THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY also stood out as one of 1962's best and most innovative films, a status that it maintains even to this day, almost half a century later.  It is an essential film, for Western film buffs and cineastes of all kinds.",1308268800,2,3592,4.917355371900826

After all, this movie is now 48 years old, so maybe you need a litle gray in your hair to 'get it'.
The theme: A couple of aging cowboys, having lived beyond their time, are  merely trying to make a living.  As a result, they find themselves in a situation not of their making, and deal with it according to their code.  (""Do the right thing even, or especially, when no one is looking."")  Sadly, this Code is a thing of the past, and to try to explain it to a young person is probably akin to teaching a pig to dance.  The same theme flows through, to name only a few: Lonely are the Brave; True Grit; No Country for Old Men; Junior Bonner; The Wild Bunch; and Monte Walsh; but to my mind, High Country stands above them all.

414701,5,6302032245,"""Ride the High Country"" is a remarkable film, probably one of the 10 best westerns ever made. Directed by a young Sam Peckinpah fresh off his successes on TV (""Gunsmoke"", ""Broken Arrow"", ""The Rifleman"" and the best damn TV western ever ""The Westerner""), it stars Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea.

Joel McCrea was in his late 50s when the film was made. He had a long career starting in the silent film era, and appeared in more than 50 films, usually as a hero in westerns - ""Wells Fargo"" (1937), ""Union Pacific"" (1939), ""The Virginian"" (1946), and ""Four Faces West"" (1948). But McCrea wasn't limited to western films, and he gave good performances in films such as ""Foreign Correspondent"" (1940) and ""Sullivan's Travels"" (1941). By the time of ""High Country"" his career had faltered and he was making forgettable westerns at 1 to 3 per year. Although some people claim McCrea retired after ""High Country"", the truth is he did 4 more films, retiring in 1976.

Randolph Scott was in his early 60s when ""High Country"" was filmed. Like McCrea, he started in silent films and like McCrea his early career involved playing a variety of characters in a variety of films - ""My Favorite Wife"" (1940), ""To the Shores of Tripoli"" (1941), ""Captain Kidd"" (1945), ""Home Sweet Homicide"" (1946) - but by the 50s he too was appearing exclusively in B westerns - ""Sugarfoot"" (1951), ""Carson City"" (1952), ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954), ""7th Calvary"" (1956), ""Westbound"" (1958) - most of which were directed by Budd Boetticher (7 films) or Andre de Toth (6 films). By the time of ""High Country"" Scott had amassed a fortune from California real estate investments, and he retired from film making because he considered his performance in ""High Country"" to be a good note to go out on.

Scott and McCreas are virtually interchangeable for the two parts. In fact, they were originally signed to play the other's part, but changed their minds and swapped. Indeed the original ending was also swapped around. Billing for the film was also decided by the toss of a coin, which Scott won.

""High Country"" was Peckinpah's second film. He would follow this with ""Major Dundee"" (1965) and then go on to make ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969) and ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" (1973), two of the finest westerns ever made, giving Peckinpah 3 of the top 10. But here at the beginning there is none of the slow motion violence that would characterize his later films. Instead, this film is character based, as are his later films, and focused on the transition when the old west was ending and the new west hadn't yet begun. In such times, what is a man's obligation to himself and to his friends? This was Peckinpah's gold and he mined it better than any other director.

Peckinpah regulars Warren Oates and L.Q. Jones appear in ""High Country"". Jones met Peckinpah while he was doing the ""Klondike"" TV series and followed him to the big screen where he would be the one actor to appear in more Peckinpah films than any other (5). Jones continued to act well into his 70s with roles in ""Prairie Home Companion"" (2006) and ""The Mask of Zorro"" (1998)

Warren Oates met Peckinpah during filming of ""The Westerner"" and like Jones, followed him for the next two decades, appearing in ""Major Dundee"" (1965), ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969), and ""Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"" (1974). Oates was a prolific actor, appearing in more than 50 films and more than 100 TV shows. He starred as ""Dillinger"" (1973) in which gave one of the best performances ever.

Mariette Hartley makes her screen debut in ""High Country"" but quickly found more
fertile ground in TV appearing in episodes of ""Twilight Zone"", ""Star Trek"", ""Peyton Place"" etc. She won an Emmy for her role in ""The Incredible Hulk"" (1978) and had 5 more nominations. In ""High Country"" she plays a teenage girl trying to get out from under the harsh hand of her religious father.

R.G. Armstrong, as the religious fanatic, is a scene stealer which is saying something for a film that has such a distinguished cast. Like Scott and McCrea, Armstrong was generally known for playing westerns. He met Peckinpah on the set of ""The Westerner"" and he would appear in ""Major Dundee"" (1965), ""Cable Hogue"" (1970) and is best remembered as Bob Ollinger, the religious deputy who is killed by a shotgun blast filled with dimes, in ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" (1973). In real life Armstrong had strong conflicts about his religious beliefs, and Peckinpah purposefully used this to cinematic advantage in casting him.

Lucien Ballard shoots the film as if it were a lullaby. The location is beautiful and Ballard captures it to full advantage. The New York Times said: ""excellently photographed in color against some lovely vistas"". Over his 50 year career Ballard was voted Best Cinematographer at the Venice Film festival (""The Devil is a Woman"") in 1935, was Oscar nominated (""The Caretakers"" )in 1963 and won an NSFC award for his work on ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). He worked with Peckinpah on the TV series ""The Westerner"" and then on many other films, including ""Cable Hogue"" (1970), ""Junior Bonner"" (1972), and ""The Getaway"" (1972). He was a favorite cinematographer of director Budd Boetticher who worked on 7 Randolph Scott films.

The beautiful musical score is by George Bassman, known for his work with the Marx Brothers (""Day at the Races"", ""Go West"") and ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939). While his work on ""High Country"" is excellent, he clashed several times with Peckinpah, and this was one of his last films.

The film was released by MGM as part of a 2 film double feature(along with ""The Tartars""), but critics found it nonetheless and were impressed. Newsweek called is the ""best film of the year"" and ""pure gold"" and Time put it on its list of top 10 films. While it was a box office bomb in the US, it was a smash in Europe (where it was called ""Guns in the Afternoon"") and became one of MGM's highest grossing European releases ever. It won first prize at the Cannes Film Festival, Grand Prize in Brussels, and Best Foreign Film in Mexico.

Much of what you see in ""High Country"" you'll see in later Peckinpah films. Interplay between Scott and McCrea will be recast in the interplay between Robert Ryan and William Holden in ""The Wild Bunch"" and the final scene in ""High Country"" with one of the fallen men looking out into the mountains will be recast as the dying scene of Slim Pickins, looking out alone over the river, in ""Pat Garrett"".",1269475200,7,6450,4.7286476868327405

Firmly established as Western stars in the 1950s, Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea hung up their spurs with this American classic. Masterfully directed by Sam Peckinpah, ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) is a work of visual and philosophical beauty. Released the same year as John Ford's wistful ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" the film centers on two aging gunmen confronted by a changing and uncertain West. In a fitting valedictory, the veteran presence of Scott and McCrea takes on a mythic power that resonates long after the poignant conclusion.

414704,5,6302032245,"This classic Western is truly one of Sam Peckinpah's best films. The acting by Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott make the movie very enjoyable. The camera work by Lucien Ballard of the 'High Country' of the title is just excellent. Also, the dialogue is a very strong point to the film and the delivery by the two old pros is sometimes very funny, other times very poignant. Also some of the villains are played by some truly excellent character actors: Warren Oates and L.Q. Jones ,in particular. Mariette Hartley is also quite good as the main female character.

The way the main characters have to deal with getting older is deftly done. The ending is one of the best in any Western film. All Western fans must see this film as it is truly toward the top of the genre. Films in 1962 or now don't get much better than 'High Country'.

The DVD has very good picture and sound plus a really wonderful Commentary done by Peckinpah historians who really add interesting info on the making of the film and the story behind it.

Highly Recommended! They really don't make movies like this anymore!

414766,5,6302032245,"In many ways RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY is a tribute to two great western stars-McCrea and Scott.  It is a story of two aging, former lawmen who are good friends.
Both of them are just doing what they can to get by day by day, to survive a changing world.  What they have left is their memories, their sense of pride, and their integrity.

Their integrity is tested throughout the film.  Sometimes, integrity is tested when the temptation of gold is tossed into the stew pot of life.  Lying under the stars on an old saddle, covered by a worn blanket and suffering aching joints, the memory of a righteous life tends to fade. The lure of quick riches, a hot bath in a royal hotel, a set of new clothes and a descent meal intrude into the dreams. Dreams are often an echo of hidden desires and unrequited realities.

George Bassman's overture is a haunting mix of inspirational western music and subtle hints of a requiem.  The music reaches its climax in the last scenes.

Sam Peckinpah's direction took the western genre into a new direction. It presented a morality tale with flawed human beings who struggled with their demons and the desire to do what is right.  This western world is a harsh, brutal, cold and violent place where religion and sinful human nature play off each other.  The good guys and the bad guys are not so clear-cut.  There are no white and black hats.

In summary: the film is a soliloquy to the western.",1225152000,4,1426,4.484496124031008

It is one of those rare films that gets even better the more you see it. If you have never seen it, I am envious.

But it is also a very good movie outside its genre.  And, it is the telling of the story by its actors that truly makes this one  memorable.

I read a review of this film somewhere else (IMBD maybe?) that stated that this was the last of the B grade Westerns.  If so, this is certainly one of the best.  It's ironic that one of the last films of this genre actually defines it.  There is so much to love about this film.  First, and most importantly, the story line is surprisingly complex for a film of this genre. This is no simple good guys versus bad guys type Western, the roles are more morally ambiguous and subtle.  Second, this was the last performance for one of the actors (Scott) and the last decent performance by the other (McCrea) who largely defined the genre.  Scott of course is an icon of the B Western, and McCrea had a solid career as well making this type of film.  The plot is relatively straight forward.  Two old friends decide to work together one last time.  Their job is to ride up to a mining town, collect gold from the miners, and return it safely to the bank.  One of the two decides it might be more profitable to take off with the gold themselves.  Along the way they pickup a young Mariette Hartley who wants to escape from her overprotective Bible-quoting father.  Things get interesting when Hartley marries a brute in the mining town and the groom and his family decide that she can't change her mind.

Rich in character actors and building on the strength of waning western acting legends Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott, this gem of a motion picture refused to let westerns fade away.  This was made at a time when big screen westerns had begun to lose steam - ""How the West Was Won"" was filming and television networks were saturated with bounty hunters, marshals, loners, and other episodic pioneers of the wild west.  This is a fitting tribute to McCrea and Scott who are unforgettable as former friends who team up for one last adventure.  Look for Mariette Hartley, James Drury, Warren Oates, Edgar Buchanan, and R.G. Armstrong in supporting roles.

Special footnote, George Randolph Scott better known as Randolph Scott, was an American film actor whose career spanned the sound era from the late 1920s to the early 1960s ... his popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such films as ""Gung Ho""! (1943) and ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" (1938); but he was especially famous for his numerous Westerns including ""Virginia City"" (1940) with Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart, ""Western Union"" (1941) with Robert Young and ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea (a coin was flipped to see whether Scott or McCrea would receive top billing, and Scott won despite having a slightly smaller role) ... his long fistfight with John Wayne in ""The Spoilers"" (1942) was frequently cited by critics and the press as the most thrilling ever filmed; they were fighting over Marlene Dietrich ... another smash hit film together that same year called ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) once again with Dietrich, Scott and Wayne --- Daniel Webster defines ""Legend"", as being a notable person, or the stories told about that person exploits --- well by the time Randolph Scott made his best films he had long established himself as a legend in the film industry --- they say practice makes perfect, if that is true by 1958 at 60 years of age he was the master with these oaters from the 50s ... ""The Cariboo Trail"" (1950), ""The Nevadan"" (1950), ""Colt .45"" (1950), ""Santa Fe"" (1951), ""Sugarfoot"" (1951), ""Fort Worth"" (1951), ""Man in the Saddle"" (1951), ""Carson City"" (1952), ""The Man Behind the Gun"" (1952), ""Hangman's Knot"" (1952), ""Thunder over the Plains"" (1953), ""The Stranger Wore a Gun"" (1953), ""Ten Wanted Men"" (1954), ""Riding Shotgun"" (1954), ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954), ""Rage at Dawn"" (1955), ""Tall Man Riding"" (1955), ""A Lawless Street"" (1955), ""Seven Men from Now"" (1956), ""Seventh Cavalry"" (1956), ""Decision at Sundown: (1957), ""Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend"" (1957), ""The Tall T"" (1957), ""Buchanan Rides Alone"" (1958), ""Ride Lonesome"" (1959), ""Westbound"" (1959), ""Comanche Station"" (1960) --- Scott's age seemed to matter little, they only came to see another Randolph Scott film and always got their money's worth --- Scott's films were good and getting better becoming classics --- so if you wonder ""What Ever Happened To Randolph Scott"", just rent or purchase one of his films and you'll see he's never left us.

414827,5,6302032245,"Peckinpah really hit his stride as director with his second picture, RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY.  An intelligent screenplay, gorgeous cinematography, fine acting from a distinguished supporting cast (including a very appealling Mariette Hartley in her film debut), and the picture's crowning glory -- two career-topping performances from stars Scott and McCrea.  Both were always underrated actors, and here their work, both economical and rich with the weight of years of experience, is absolutely marvellous.  Outfitted in a fine new DVD transfer, complete with a good commentary track from Peckinpah scholars and a fascinating documentary featuring Peckinpah's sister, this is one picture that repays repeated viewings.  An essential purchase.",1176336000,4,741,5.833333333333333
414828,5,6302032245,"This Peckinpah masterwork is a breath of fresh air after the stifling conventions of 1950s western genre. This film is modern in every sense with its downbeat view of heroism and challenging of western conventions.

The story of two aging gunfighters is filled with interesting characters and situations. The real secret to its charm is the telling attention to little details in the characters. The marriage scene is an especially memorable set-piece.

This is Peckinpah's finest film told with real warmth and restraint. There is real depth here that may suprise people who have only seen his later films.

The musical score and a couple of studio-shot scenes are the only thing that really date it.

Beautifully shot and masterfully directed with a haunting closing shot.",1174435200,4,774,5.119047619047619

It was Marinette Hartley's first role & she played Elsa. There are quite a few characters such as Edgar Buchanan, Warren Oates, etc. This is a kinder gentler Sam Peckinpah in his directorial debut. No blood baths here as in his later westerns. Gil & Steve have fallen on hard times. Their world is dying & they are dinosaurs. Horseless carraiges have made their appearance. But both men are still handy with a gun. Steve takes a job hauling gold back from a distant mine to a bank that hires him in part because of his reputation. He needs help & his old friend Gil is available with his young, green partner, Heck (Ron Storm). Gil's plan is to convince Steve, peacefully if possible, to steal the gold. He has lots of time to work on Steve since it is several days on the trail to get to the mining camp. Along the way they meet a farmer's daughter, Elsa & her father. She is a virtual prisoner on the farm & is hot to trot. She & Heck fall in love immediately. She leaves with them to marry a suitor, one of the Hammond boys, who have a claim at the mine. She doesn't love him of course. She also discovers, on her wedding night, that when you marry one of the Hammonds, you marry all of them. She flees to the safety of Steve, Gil & Heck. They leave with the gold they've purchased for the bank & Elsa with the Hammonds in hot pursuit. Gil is unable to turn Steve to thievery & Steve arrests Gil & disarms him & Heck. They must however, makes common cause because the Hammonds are closing in to reclaim Elsa & kill them. In the end, Joel McCrea is killed & so basically is his career.

414830,4,6302032245,"Even for those who generally do not appreciate Westerns, 'Ride the High Country' is an absorbing and moving piece of entertainment... For Western buffs it is an item of study, with its accurate period detail and the vistas of the California Sierras, near Mammoth Lakes... The film firmly established Peckinpah as a director of unusual style, a man with the ability to create strange images, often ugly ones in beautiful settings, although his talent in staging scenes of violence is shockingly impressive...

Peckinpah's mining community in this film is memorable for its spirited and dangerous atmosphere, with its one true gold mine being the whorehouse... The madam is a cheerful nightmare, and hidden in a corner is a drunken judge (Edgar Buchanan), with a bottle of whiskey, who comes alive only to remind us that people change...

'Ride the High Country' gets additional poignancy from its choice of stars... They made so many Westerns over the years, and they had long been personal friends... It was the happiest inspiration that got them together for this afterglow ride that resulted in two unforgettable performances... But one wonders exact1y how they savor the situation--that after so much riding, over so many years, it has taken a late, almost afterthought ride, to place them securely among Western immortals... It is, indeed, a happy finale to a pleasing career and a nostalgic reminder of the simple virtues and values of the more traditional Western heroes...

Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott had come to specialize in many fine westerns, set an admirable style in quiet heroism, always courageous, ever dignified, never vulgar... They ride this time together, ruminating over times that used to be... Both are heroic figures, having been noted lawmen, and yet they are now reduced to taking whatever comes their way in order to live...

One is a man of moral rectitude who believes in fulfilling his obligations, 'doing the job' just like in his old days as lawman... The other out to make one last haul in order to retire with a measure of comfort... But both are old-timers striving to make ends meet in a changing West where they no longer belong...

They are clearly past it--McCrea goes into a washroom so that he will not be seen putting on spectacles in order to read a contract; Scott asks his captor to cut him loose for the night, offering only one reason: 'I don't sleep so good anymore.' Both sleep in long combs and pause on a tiring journey to bathe their aching feet in a cold stream... And in the end they defend the old values against the new with pride, dignity, never forgotten their skill with six-guns...

'Ride the High Country' had a number of interesting sub-plots and characters and an earthy but tasteful approach to sex... Its strength, however, lay in the sincere and moving portrayals of its two major stars, and in the beauty and poignancy of its final scene...

The basic theme of the movie is strong, moving and valid, but, above all, it is the elegiac feel that makes it such a memorable motion picture--the serious thoughts of two veterans about 'how it was.'

These are men with tired feet, caught up in the turn of the times... They are still there in the afterglow period of Western history... It's a long way back now to 'High Noon,' and the sun of 'Red River,' 'Shane,' 'Johnny Guitar,' and 'The Searchers' has left the sky forever...",1162684800,10,3393,4.827882960413081
414831,5,6302032245,"Ride The High Country is one of those curious works of art that bridges the past and the present, combining the best of both worlds while being extremely enriching and satisfying on its own merits. The first major film of legendary film director Sam Peckinpah, it stands with his other Western film The Wild Bunch as two of the greatest film of its, or any other genre.

Featuring two actors who were indivisibly synomous with Western films, Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott, and featuring supporting performances by Ron Starr, Mariette Hartley, RG Armstrong, Warren Oates, LQ Jones, James Drury and Edgar Buchanan, the film tells what seems like a fairly simple story, and makes it violently poetic and elegiac all at once.

McCrea and Scott play two aging ex-lawmen who are living out their remaining years in vastly different ways. McCrea picks up odd transport and security jobs because he's now too old to be a lawman. Scott performs in a Wild West show because he'd rather act that cling to a life of serving the law. When McCrea asks Scott's help in transporting miners' gold, Scott sees an opportunity to get rich quick, and along with his young sidekick, join McCrea in the hopes of convincing McCrea of running off with the gold. Along the way, they run into a sheltered farm girl who runs off and marries Drury, who comes from a family of backwoods maniacs. And so the story goes...

Ride The High Country is traditional in its casting of solid, if older Western stars like McCrea and Scott, traditional in the values espoused by McCrea, those of loyalty, honor, and sacrifice. The film is modern in how it depicts the two older men as products of a rapidly bygone era that is not loyal, does not honor, and in fact sacrifices them at the expense of modern life. The film has its cake and eats it too because it is wonderfully made, wonderful written, and wonderfully acted.

Randolph Scott, who had become a very wealthy man and made movies for the enjoyment and not out of necessity, left acting forever after appearing in Ride The High Country. He knew he would never make a greater film, and in fact, this was the best Western he ever made, even surpassing the great Westerns he made with Budd Boetticher.

414833,4,6302032245,"RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY (1962, MGM) is one of four titles in SAM PECKINPAH'S THE LEGENDARY WESTERNS COLLECTION.  All four titles go a long way toward placing Peckinpah in the pantheon of western filmmakers.  HIGH COUNTRY rates **** (out of ****) from stingy Leonard Maltin, so it is hard to call it a ""guilty pleasure.""  But maybe it should be since it was shut out of the 1962 Oscars.  It has a script by N. B. Stone, Jr. and has been magnificently photographed in CinemaScope and Metrocolor by Lucien Ballard on high Sierra and Inyo Forest locations.  At their very best, at the end of illustrious film careers, Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea play aging gunfighters lost in time around the 1880's.  The Gold Rush era is over, but there is still good money to be made in escorting gold bullion from the top of the California Sierra forests to a frontier town in the valley below.  Scott and McCrea are up to the challenge, but hesitate when a preacher's daughter (Mariette Hartley in her film debut) and a tenderfoot come with the deal.  ""This is a mission for gold, not romance,"" proclaims one of the two aging men.  This superb and intelligent western will come as a revelation to movie lovers who only can think of Sam Peckinpah in terms of poetic bloodbath westerns.  It balances lyrical romance with the old mens' code of ethics expertly, and it has been filmed on gorgeous California Gold Rush country locations with glorious performances by everyone.

Ride the High Country is a masterpiece, one of my favorite Westerns of all time. The conversations between two old buddies, the ""one-liners"", the sarcastic remarks, the scenery and settings, it's all great.  I'm not going to talk about the story.  It's been told enough already. But I will say this. I am not easily moved by what happens in movies. After all, men aren't supposed to be emotional. But, the ending of this movie really got to me. It was the icing on the cake.

This film acts as a bridge between the romanticism of John Ford and the psychological Westerns of Anthony Harvey to create something that was totally unique.  Joel McCrea represents the legendary upright hero who is contracted to deliver a valuable shipment of gold for literally peanuts.  Randolph Scott's character is a little more morally ambiguous because he contracts a slight case of gold fever.  Peckinpah territory is represented by the unruly mining town and the unsavory Hammond brothers.  This kind of raw depiction of the West is something not seen before.  The film is highlighted by complex characters and vivid photography by Peckinpah stalwart Lucien Ballard.

With all the praise inexplicably heaped on a piece of crap called ""A History of Violence"", a ridiculous, mindless film, based on a barely literate cartoon strip, you often wonder exactly what has happened to American films - which used to be the envy of the world for their craftsmanship and acting. ""Ride the High Country"" was apparently considered a very good little ""B"" movie in its first release - but time and care now reveals it to be an American classic. Two terrific actors, in their glorious twilight, working with an upcoming director, team up for a beautifully crafted, gorgeously filmed and scored, Western about character and justice. TCM has been showing the widescreen version of this gem for a couple of years - and now here it is where it belongs - on DVD for every true film fan to see.  Forget Tarantino's mindless violence.  Forget the quick cuts and lack of storytelling talent of practically every film director in the business right now: this is how it is done, and the director of this film never did as well (he too lapsed into cheap ""slow motion"" violence and other inhuman traits as his own film career lurched on).  Here we have a story told with depth and clarity - and HUMANITY. Scott and McCrea are two great stars who know something about manhood, decency, wit, grace, and strength.  Where are these kinds of films now? Where are the male actors who can inhabit these roles with some degree of class, grace, and strength? Why can't ANYONE do a simple, clear, human Western, as it was once done, which often had so much to say about contemporary times (""High Noon,"" as one example)?

First at all this an absolutely first rate western  We have a simple story in which we have two old-time gunfighters who are hired to guard a gold shipment . Mc Rea only wants to do a good job but Randolph Scott thinks in a major scope , he cares nothing the noblesse , he lives his last days and well you know , Alberich soul reborns once again . And that is a real catastrophe a real earthquake about their long friendship .

Far beyond the glorious script the spirit of the aristos survives in this work in which there are secondary characters as the young deeply fallen in love with his wife ; they will join to this adventure . There are many other issues around the plot that it will strike you .

If the Wild Bunch and the ballad of Cable Hogue are his latest works , this may be well the best artistic and fine work Of Sam Peckinpah . You will miss the beuty violence of his latest works but you will be surprise of what Peckinpah could make with this story written by N.B.Stone , Jr . Filmed in the glorious Inyo National Forest in California.

The best performances in the lives of Mac Rea and Scott and resulted so good picture that both of them decided to retire after making it .

414902,5,6302032245,"This is one time that I have to take exception to the house reviewer.  Yes, it's an essential piece of American cinema.  Yes, it's one of Peckinpah's best films.  But the review overlooks so much.

This was the cinematic swan song for two more-than-noteworthy stars of quintessentially American movies.  Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott both turn in magnificent performances, as do the extras-- notably Peckinpah regular (and perhaps the most under-appreciated American actor ever to grace the screen) Warren Oates.  And you don't have to look fast for him, folks.  He's a big part of the film.

In a way, Ride the High Country was deconstructionist before Unforgiven ever hit the big screen-- by thirty years or so.  Like Eastwood's hit, the film manages to express reverence for and contempt of the mythology of the American West at the same time.  All the stock players are here, but never presented as stereotypes.  Bankers, prostitutes, prospectors, missionaries, young bucks, lawmen, hucksters and outlaws.  Anyone familiar with westerns knows the drill.  Only this time it's different.

Though recognized as a genius, Peckinpah is just as often derided as a misogynistic Hemingway-wannabe these days.  What a shame.  This film is no macho fantasy.  Instead, it's a look at the seemingly inevitable (and lamentable) decay of principles that results when high-minded people find themselves in a situation and a setting that doesn't conform to their preconceptions of how things ought to be (Straw Dogs, anyone?)-- and what happens when they 'return to normalcy' in the wake of atrocity.  When everything's on the line, one might just be faced with the sort of challenge to faith (in anything held dear) that we all dread confronting.  Stand true and lose it all, or sell out and win? Or is there an easy out?  This would be a theme throughout the director's work, but here it is ingeniously presented in an ostensibly straightforward horse opera that cleverly plays on viewer expectations.  What appears to be another entry in a breezy, escapist genre ultimately reveals itself to be a meditation on just how difficult it is to ever escape the travails of life.  And how much it can cost to achieve that same goal.

As much as the film points an accusing finger at the western, there are many ways in which the director expresses his own sense of hope that such fairy-tale wishes could come true.  Guess I'll have to settle for the Police Academy box set while I wait for this one to turn up on DVD.....",1093996800,99,2506,4.897862232779097

Sam Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY is one of the finest western adventures in cinematic history. Everything---the superb acting from old time veterans Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea, the crisp and pointed dialogue, the camera work (and film editing), and the never-overdone elegiac underlay of farewell and warning, not just about the ""old west"" of the motion pictures (of the 1930-1960 period), but about the reality of the American frontier and the American spirit--adds up to excellence.
If two actors truly symbolized the Old West of public imagination, certainly those actors were Randy Scott and Joel McCrea. How fitting that RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY should be their ""so long, pardner"" to the genre! In 1962 the classic Western was dying, the genre changing, just as America was changing. The spirit of American innocence and optimism was subtly being transformed--while we longed for the return of Randy Scott, Gene Autry, Hopalong Cassidy, and moral certainties, Vietnam would soon make us a nation of cynics and skeptics.  Thus, RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY is more than just a salute to two great Western actors and their farewell to that enduring American film creation the classic Western; RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY tells us, through two of the most admired cowboy actors of all time, about ouselves, about changing American society, and presents us with a classic morality tale. Steve (McCrea)Judd's remarkable words to Gil (Scott) Westrum, when Westrum gently suggests they might skip out with the gold they are charged with transporting, says it all: ""All I want to do is enter my house justifed."" It was the classic, optimistic  American dream that motivated the pioneers of the old West just as it did the pioneers of Virginia or Massachusetts, the foundation of our society ""to enter our house justified,"" to make a just and fair life for ourselves in a new land. RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY reminds us, this one last time, of our original national purpose, and shows us the pitfalls along the way--not just temptation but the ""times"" that threaten us.
In the end Westrum (Scott) returns (repents of his deviation from the moral course) to Judd's rescue...and Judd's response is: ""I knew you would [return] all the time.""  Perhaps it is indeed too late, for Judd dies, alone, in one of the most  amazing scenes in all cinema. Does his fervent dream of a ""house justified"" die with him? Does the older America of undbounded optimism and a moral code disappear with his departure and the end of the western frontier---and the end of ""old time"" Westerns? Peckinpah does not answer, and we are left to ponder. But one thing IS certain...we are never the same after watcbing this marvelous film.",1023580800,18,2844,4.894190871369295

The job done here for this Blu-ray is outstanding. It is near flawless in picture and sound. I loved watching it on the 55"" UHD.

The two actors form a business partnership to go and transport Gold Dust from a high mining camp and then back down to the town's bank for deposit. Along the way, the son of ""Randolph Scott's character"" joins them after a rough start at the local saloon. They then go see a man they know for an overnight stay. He has a daughter, a young Mariette Hartley, who looks devine in a dress. The son becomes smitten with her only to find out she has a suitor. All is not lost though as she comes to liking him over time. The wedding of her and her suitor doesn't last long in the camp and problems arise from it. The hubby's family and himself are abusive to the new bride and she tells all, I am not going back to that man.
The two men in the business partnership, leave town as soon as they can with the Gold Dust collected for deposit.
The son and newlywed ""Hartley"" follow suit as they are all eager to get out of that mining camp with what they have.

It's a great movie and the recent release of this is just another reason to buy this movie now in HD Blu!!
There is a vintage Featurette on the movie, brought over from the initial DVD release, years ago and the Theatrical Trailer.
There is Audio Commentary.
The Featurette is good to see, however, it is not HD and there is no new interviews with filmmakers or any actors, for that matter.

Highly recommended movie now in Blu-ray format!!",1515628800,,1683,4.2367601246105915
