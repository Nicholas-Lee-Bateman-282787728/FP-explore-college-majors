1030777,4,6305463425,"Sitting down to watch a suspense film with a title like ""Bedroom Window"" led my movie addled brain to start looking for connections to Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" And they are there, from the crime witnessed through a window with limited information to the directing of Curtis Hanson that relies heavily on techniques that were used throughout ""Rear Window."" You know, shot of voyeur watching somebody suspicious, cut to suspicious guy doing something, cut back to voyeur for reaction shot. The Hitchcock references do not stop there however, rather the entire film is a cornucopia of homages. We have a psycho killer who lives at home with his faceless, controlling mother. Plus the main storyline is that of a man, a Wrong Man if you will, who falls under the hostile eye of the police for a crime he did not commit. So yes, you have seen it all before, but I happily gobbled it up all over again, and then realized that what I had just consumed was actually better than most of Hitchcock's oeuvre.

The plot is one of those that motors along solely because nothing ever goes right. All of the twists are perfectly thought out and it makes for a delightfully messed up tale, but it all totally unrealistic because, come on, who is ever really that unlucky? Terry (Steve Guttenberg) is having an affair with his boss' blonde, accented wife when she spies an assault outside his apartment. The next day a different girl turns up dead a few blocks away but Sylvia (Isabelle Huppert) can't go to the police because that would expose their little tryst. So Terry, trying to be a hero, takes her place and reports the crime. Soon after he is convinced that he has found the real killer himself which leads to him chasing this man, Carl Henderson (Brad Greenquist), around town until his suspicions are verified. One thing leads to another and the next thing you know Carl is running free and Terry is the main suspect. Of course it is all his fault, trying to impress the lady and all that, but this film makes a strong case for not doing your civic duty.

I really have almost all good things to say about this film. It is basically a movie about lying, and how the lies build upon themselves until your normal life is obliterated and you're wanted for murder. But we've all been in similar situations before which is what makes this film so powerful. The courtroom scene in which Wallace Shawn plays a defense attorney who dances rings around the mealy mouthed Terry has no more style than a typical ""Law and Order"" episode, but is just as engrossing. I was surprised to see Carl Lumbly show up as one of the lawyers because I was under the impression that his career began and ended with ""Alias."" Brad Greenquist does a superb job at being the frighteningly anguished suspected killer as he comes off as a Good Little Nazi with red hair. As a counterpoint to Spike Lee this film could have been called ""Don't Do the Right Thing"", as it may win you the approval of some girl and the police but ultimately it is a bad investment. Soon all parties involved think that they can dictate your next move to you only so that a few days later they can start to wonder if it was really you who did the killing. Hanson has done marvelous work since, but ""Bedroom Window"" sits near the top of his career. It has Hitchcock on the brain, but so do we, and Hanson knows how to tap into our darkest fears and serve up a pulpy thriller that gripped me from the first scene. ***3/4",1172880000,5,3461,4.509554140127388
1030778,4,6305463425,"This is indeed Steve Guttenberg's best drama. Being a huge fan of Hitchcock's works and other suspense movies like ""Along Came a Spider"" and ""Body Double"", I found this movie pretty good. I personally think Steve is a decent actor, just limited in roles suited to him. This role was suited to him as was ""Cocoon"". Purest may not be impressed by this movie, but those not so demanding should find this worth their while.

The story in a nutshell is Guttenberg is sleeping with the bosses wife so when she sees an attempted murder she can't report it so Steve does instead. Since it is a man reporting they are more suspicious of him thinking either he's a voyuer or worse yet perhaps the perpetrator. Things get tense as he tries to prove his innocence and the real culprit is aware of the bosses wife and him. Is this a ripoff of the Hitchcock movie. A little, but the update and slight story change make it interesting and different enough that I found it entertaining.

By the way don't buy this DVD from a scalper for a ridiculous price. It is being redistributed in November 2006. I pre-ordered mine for $9.99.",1162771200,14,1114,4.50990099009901
1030779,4,6305463425,"A married woman (Isabelle Huppert), while at the apartment of the man she's having an affair with, witnesses an attempted murder outside the window. Leery about going to the cops, the boyfriend (Steve Guttenberg) does it for her. Thus begins all kinds of twists and turns and complications in this taut and entertaining thriller. Some of them are pretty implausable, but before you have time to sort one out the movie snowballs into the next one. Huppert double crosses Guttenberg, of course, to protect herself, and Guttenberg eventually gets help from another woman (Elizabeth McGovern), whom he ends up with at movie's end. There are lots of Hitchcockian touches: the premise itself from ""Rear Window"" and a stabbing scene at the ballet from ""North by Northwest."" Not a bad movie at all.",1111190400,4,790,4.992424242424242
1030780,5,6305463425,"I first saw this movie with the lowest of expectations, and boy was I surprised! Steve Guttenburg is surprisingly (there's that word again!) well cast as an ordinary Joe Schmo caught up in a series of increasingly tangled events brought on by an attempted murder which takes place outside of his bedroom window. Isabelle Huppert and Elizabeth McGovern are enjoyable as well in two very different femme fatale roles. I know that people like to compare this movie to Hitchcock films, but frankly, who cares? It's the old apples and oranges analogy. The Bedroom Window is a slick, enjoyable thriller worth looking for!",1103673600,4,615,4.980582524271845
1030781,2,6305463425,"This weak and contrived film is a very pale imitation of Hitchcock.  It actually begins in a very promising way-Terry Lambert (Steve Guttenberg) is having an affair with his boss's wife (Isabelle Huppert).  She witnesses an attack on a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) outside Terry's bedroom window, but he agrees to report it to the police as if he saw it so that their relationship will remain secret.  His story (and the film's) begins to fall apart until eventually he is on the run for crimes he didn't commit.
With ""L.A. Confidential,"" writer/director Curtis Hanson would later show that he is capable of crafting top-flight film fare, but he just doesn't make it here.  The script is too far-fetched and the character's actions become increasingly implausible until the over-wrought, unconvincing conclusion.  The decidedly low wattage of stars Guttenberg and McGovern doesn't help either.",1064707200,6,891,5.246478873239437

If you haven't seen this movie, please do!!!
This film was originally released in 1987 and it still holds it's own today!!!!
This movie was exceptional and I am glad that I came across it!!!!
In the style of Alfred Hitchcock, Director/Writer Curtis Hanson has given us this film classic!!!

1030783,3,6305463425,"Start with a shaky premiss, add some unlikely plot twists, some suspense, and a whole bunch of stupidity and what do you have?  You have counterfeit  Hitchcock.  Well, at least the title is close, although The Bedroom Window  (1987) is not anything near as interesting as, say, Hitchcock's Rear Window  (1954).
I particularly did not like the far-fetched scheme that Terry and  Denise came up with at the end to entrap the psycho.  And Terry's  insistence on that phone booth and only that phone booth from which to call  the cops was silly and unnecessary.  And his snatching of the police car,  ditto.
Not to belabor the stupidities, but when only the defense attorney  knows that Lambert wears contacts-not the prosecution, not Sylvia,  apparently not himself, and certainly the audience wasn't clued in-then  you've got Hitchcock rolling over in his grave as this very important bit  of plot knowledge is exposed at the last moment.  Director Curtis Hanson  should know better.  I hope he really did plant the contact lenses  somewhere early on as Hitchcock would have, and I just missed them.
Worse  offense though was making it appear that Terry wasn't attracted to Denise,  even though she was throwing herself at him.  Shame on you, Curtis Hanson.  Hitchcock would never do that.  Not only don't you resolve your subplot,  you offend those in your audience who identified with your  heroine.
Nonetheless this is not a bad movie.  Steve Guttenberg, while no  James Stewart (or Cary Grant, for that matter) is agreeable as Terry  Lambert, a kind of benign ladies man who seduces his boss's wife, Sylvia,  played by the delicate French beauty, Isabelle Huppert.  He learns that  she was the wrong girl.  The right girl is of course Elizabeth McGovern  (Denise) although I would prefer it the other way around.",965260800,10,1814,4.916943521594685

1030785,1,6305463425,"This is not a review on ""The Bedroom Window"" which is by the way a fairly exciting suspenser well directed by Curtis ""L.A Confidential"" Hanson, but an outburst of anger against the scandalous,  revolting, outrageous and insulting behaviour of the PIONNEER  ""mob"" who are injecting Pan & Scan in what was till now an  intelligent, exciting and most tempting new standard: DVD. It is really  upsetting to see that some scumbags (excuse the word but I am really really  furious) are not giving us the choice between widescreen and full screen  formats. It is depressing to think that DVD could become in the near future  what VHS used to be. Something that destroyed pictures instead of giving  them a new life. I beg you not to encourage this kind of products by  avoiding them completely. The Bedroom Window was shot in 2.35:1 (scope)  which simply means that half of the picture is missing. PIONNEER is a sure  stinker and as far as I am concerned I am banning all their products. The  Cassandra Crossing has just benefited of the same shock treatment. That was  not what DVD was created for.",936230400,19,1092,4.684210526315789

1030850,4,6305463425,"Curtis Hanson made great movies like <Hands that rocks the Cradle><LA Confidential> and <The River Runs Through it> and <8 Miles>and also small movie like <Wonder Boys>Boys. This movie was a small little thriller.
There was nothing new.
Steve Guttenberg is having an affair with this married woman and they just had sex in his apartment and The woman whitnessed from outside the window that a man tried to torture (or even kill) a lady.
Then she called Steve who was in the bathroom to see what's going on. Steve also saw what's going on briefly.
Then he calls the police and tells them what he saw. The problem was Steve cannot say that he was with the woman who was a married one. It was an affair.
Steve went to the court as a witness and the opposite lawyer finds out that he cannot see anything without his contact lense. Steve however said to the cops already that he was sleeping during that time of the night when he heard the woman screeming and he looked outside his window and witnessed her beeing tortured so at that time he shouldn't wear any contact lense. So the criminal was released free.
Then Steve becomes trouble. He followed the criminal that night and that night at some bar, there is this woman was killed. The next day a waitress who saw Steve witnessed that she clearly saw Steve in the bar and the cop began to feel that maybe Steve is the killer. Moreover, he was in the killing scene with the knife in his hand. By the time cops came, he was there with the knif in his hand.
Besides, the day the other woman was killed in front of his apartment, he went out for a walk and the cop thinks that he killed the other lady too,
Now there are two incident he were involved at the same time 1. He is thought to be the killer to the cops and chased by them. 2. The real killer is chasing him to kill him.
I saw the exact same story at least 5 times from other movies.
'A guy who witnessed a killer who killed someone and was trapped to be the killer and chased by both cops and the killer.'
But this moive was still fun to watch.
Steve Guttenberg for me was always remembered from the movie Three Men and the Bady, the comedy remake from the French film.
Elizabeth McGovern was first noticed from the movie once Upone a time in America. She was playing the adult Deborah. Then this is her third movie that I saw that she is in.
The movie is not a masterpiece or a movie to be remembered but is a good killing time movie with some popcorn or some soda.",1455667200,,2471,4.248407643312102

Comments: This is an OK movie to watch. There really isn't any gore. It is kinda suspenseful . . . a ""thriller"" type movie. It was endurable. It wasn't a dud I don't think. But it wasn't something I would buy on DVD to keep to watch over and over. Of course there is yet another plot involving someone having an affaire. But usually when people are doing things they shouldn't trouble ensues. It does here. There were a few twists that really were weak . . . the smoking gun in the court room was a joke. Most people who wear contact lenses also have glasses by their nightstand. That was not even hinted at as that would blow a hole through the plot so big you wouldn't be able to watch the movie on your 13"" TV screen. And this must have been the era when the push for more gratuitous male nudity was on. I distinctly remember a lot of talk about that back in the 80s and 90s. Anyway women and men are naked often in this movie. All the main characters except the cuckold husband are naked at some point. The setting is amazingly Baltimore. Des[ite the violence in the movie you wouldn't recognize it. It looks like Manhattan or Paris in some scenes. There really isn't much to say . . . typical movie for that era . . . although the plot made more sense than most in that era.

1031100,4,6305463425,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this film as flaws. Plural.  And they are either directorial or plot line in nature. Not enough to ruin the movie for you, in part because of Guttenberg's surprisingly well delivered dramatic role...no comedy this time. He really does a great job...he acts just like an average guy in this situation would. In other words, he is very believable in this role. The supporting cast  are not notable with the acception of Elizabeth McGovern. She delivers her role, and that's all. And, sorry, but trying to portray her as a sex pot is on the same scale as trying to portray Mother Theresa as a Hell's Angel's' biker mama. It ain't happenin. The flaws mentioned by other reviews seem harmless to the films entertainment value. But, there is one flaw that really glares...trying to squint blind sides you into almost losing the thread of the plot. It is this(if you have never seen this movie...close your eyes). Our serial killer gets the address of his victims by peeking at their open wallets lying on a table or bar top in a cocktail lounge. He leaves the bar, drives to their home, arriving ahead of them, where he then waits to spring an ambush. The movie opens with him attacking Elizabeth McGovern. The movie comes to it's dramatic close with him lying in wait for a DISGUISED Elizabeth McGovern, after sneaking a peek at her wallet while she absurdly slithers and teases the men in the bar wearing her disguise...impossible black leather skimpy out fit, blonde wig and all. What's wrong with this picture? Since it would be impossible to get a photo ID  showing her in her blonde wig and false eyelashes in time to bait the killer into attacking her disguised persona, and since the killer had attacked her before as her real self, wouldn't he have noticed she was the same women? If not her face, at least going to the same address should have caused him to smell a trap.. He sees the same photo ID, and the same address, and doesn't get. It. He pushes ahead with his plan to attack her blonde self. Maybe he was so engrossed in her jungle tempstress routine to be paying attention. Sure. That's it. That's the reason. Did I like this movie enough to buy it any way? Yes. Guttenberg defty playing a dramtic role instead of comedy is well worth the price!",1341619200,,2293,4.601466992665037
1031101,4,6305463425,"Written and directed by Curtis Hanson (LA Confidential), The Bedroom Window (1987) is a nicely paced suspense thriller that has the feel of an 80's made for cable movie, as a man having an affair with his boss's wife, attempts to help the police, and then finds himself suspected of murder.  Although the plot seems somewhat predictable and goofy, the strong acting performances help to sell the story, and there are a couple of twists that keeps things interesting.

Architect Terry Lambert (Steve Guttenberg) has become romantically involved with Sylvia Wentworth (Isabelle Huppert) the wife of his boss Colin Wentworth (Paul Shenar).  At 2am Sylvia is in Lambert's second floor apartment, when she sees a man attacking a woman on the street below.  The man is frightened away, but Sylvia gets a good look at him.  The following morning, the couple learn that another woman was found murdered nearby, but because the situation, Sylvia does not want to come forward.  Paul was in the bathroom and saw nothing, but he still phones the police, claiming to have seen the attack.  Based on what Sylvia has told him, he provides a description of the attacker to detectives Quirke (Carl Lumbly) and Jessup (Frederick Coffin).

Lambert's lie has some unexpected results, as he is called into police headquarters to view suspects in a lineup, and meets Denise (Elizabeth McGovern), the woman attacked in front of his home.  Lambert doesn't identify anyone, but becomes suspicious of Carl Henderson (Brad Greenstreet), who was included in the lineup.  He follows Henderson to a bar, and when a woman in the bar later turns up dead, Lambert finds himself drawn in even deeper in a web of intrigue and suspicion that eventually turns on him.

While much that happens is far-fetched, the smooth presentation and lively character interaction, helps to make events more plausible.  Terry Lambert isn't malicious, but is totally caught up in his lie.  Lambert's eventual partnership with Denise is entirely expected, but the depth and spunk of Elizabeth McGovern's character is a pleasant surprise, as Denise often takes the lead.  Guttenberg and McGovern are simply fun to watch together.  The versatile Guttenberg has a completely different type of relationship with Isabelle Huppert (The Piano Teacher), as Sylvia refuses to back up his story.  With the focus mostly on Terry and Denise, deranged killer Henderson, remains mostly in the background, and is a bit underdeveloped.  He isn't very subtle or sophisticated, but he is efficient and really lucky as well.

With the rather mild Steve Guttenberg as the lead, and the killer on the periphery, the film doesn't have the violent edge or dark tone, of some thrillers.  Denise and Terry are engaging characters, who at times approach trapping a murderer like a game.  Curtis Hanson's film may lack a sense of seriousness, but is still very entertaining.  The conclusion while predictably dramatic, doesn't go completely over the top.

With its romantic elements, and minimal violence, The Bedroom Window is perfect for Lifetime or other similar cable channel.  The acting performances are good, and the story has a certain familiarity and a few surprises.  Rating: 3.5 stars.",1329609600,,3216,5.105162523900574

1031106,3,6305463425,"The set-up sounds as though it was lifted straight from ""Rear Window"": while cheating on her husband, Sylvia (Isabelle Huppert) sees a woman being attacked from her lover, Terry's (Steve Guttenburg), bedroom window. However, after the first 10 - 15 minutes, ""The Bedroom Window"" diverges from the ""Rear Window"" formula and becomes its own story. Seeing that Sylvia doesn't want her husband to know that she is cheating on him but still wants to do the ""right thing"", Terry offers to report the attack to the police and pretend that he was the witness. As you would expect, things don't go to plan and soon the police suspect Terry of being the attacker and of killing several other women. It is now up to Terry to clear his name and to stop the real attacker from striking again.

After a slow-moving first half-hour, which primarily consists of Steve Guttenberg driving around Washington D.C. and staring at people, ""The Bedroom Window"" actually shapes up to be a reasonably good film. I liked the fact that the film starts off as a ""Rear Window"" clone and then takes the story in a different direction (if I wanted to see ""Rear Window"" again, I'd watch that, or at the very least, ""Disturbia"") and the turns that the story does take are interesting, albeit somewhat predictable.

Essentially this is a B-grade film that was probably released straight to video. However, it is directed by Curtis Hanson, who later went on to direct ""L.A. Confidential"", and who does a far better job at paying homage to Hitchcock than Brian DePalma did in his much over-rated ""Obsession"". Furthermore, although the high-point of his career was the ""Police Academy"" films (and with good reason, too), Steve Guttenberg is still pleasant to watch, and the second half of the film was exciting enough to make this film worth my time.",1222473600,,1813,4.8076923076923075

1031108,5,6305463425,"Isabelle Huppert and generic Steve Guttenberg prove incompatible costars in ""The Bedroom Window,"" a cockamamie mystery that finds these bi-continentals drawn together like refrigerator magnets to styrofoam coolers.

The lovers are supposed to be absolutely crazy about each other, sick with lust even, but Guttenberg's merely more blah than usual and Huppert, in her first English-speaking role, seems to be translating as she goes. It may not be all their fault. Both were saddled with a pre-L.A. Confidential. Curtis Hanson. Up to this point, Hanson's previous directing credits included such immortals as ""The Arousers"" and ""Losin' It,"" He had no business at the helm of a Hitchcock rip-off. (Was Brian DePalma unavailable?) Curtis' copycat pacing was as wrong-headed as his care and feeding of the actors -- (an area in which he seemed to favor starvation.)

Hanson's screenplay, however, isn't half bad. It's about a Baltimorean (Guttenberg) who pretends to witness a crime to conceal his affair with his boss's wife (Huppert), and then becomes a suspect in the case himself. Cherubic Elizabeth McGovern as the victim teams with Guttenberg to trap the real rapist, who gets off scot-free on one of those pesky technicalities. To bait the psycho killer, McGovern disguises herself as a floozy and slithers off to a working man's bar on the wrong side of Baltimore. She looks like a cross between a female impersonator and Alvin the Chipmunk as she wiggles on her bar stool. She makes an utter fool of herself. Where was Hanson, for instance, when she licked her forefinger and caressed the tip of the pool cue? Even Carl Lumbly as a detective -- the same Carl Lumbly who played a detective on ""Cagney & Lacey"" every week -- doesn't come off convincingly here.

Of course, we have to suffer through more romance when McGovern recovers her libidinal urges in the company of the scintillating, hopelessly attractive, Nautilus-improved Guttenberg. And they make Huppert and Guttenberg look like ""Caligula.""
