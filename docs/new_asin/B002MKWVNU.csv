8373940,5,B002MKWVNU,This is a wonderful series. It is about two painters from long ago who introduced the feeling of motion into their paintings. One painter is older and is the teacher to the younger man. It has many twists and turns about sex and love. All of the actors are spectacular. The entire series runs about 18 hours and I hated to see it end. I highly recommend this drama.,1506038400,,365,4.304347826086956
8373941,3,B002MKWVNU,"This drama may have beautiful scenery, music and costumes, but there's a major problem. The English Subtitles are very poor.
 If a company wants to sell their product to English only speakers, please provide good subtitles. It's difficult to follow a story, when the translations are so limited. I was constantly having to guess what they were saying,  I found it disappointing.",1500940800,,378,5.080645161290323
8373942,5,B002MKWVNU,Enjoyable movie.  Watched it 3 times.,1458777600,,37,5.166666666666667
8373943,3,B002MKWVNU,"I've bought it only because Korean subtitles.

From my point of view, it is blasphemy to change the gender of the real historical person (man) and  transform him into the woman, which, in turn, disguises herself as a man (mostly).

=The worst package box form the manufacturer I've ever seen.=
DVDs slip out from the holders freely and hang about inside the boxes. O_O
It's a miracle that DVDs are still readable.",1410134400,3,413,4.708333333333333
8373944,5,B002MKWVNU,"A period piece influenced by actual events.  A well- deserved award-winning performance by Moon Gun Young.  Excellent music score.  A variety of interesting sub-plots, easy to follow.  An epic historical romance.  English subtitles. The only problem is having to put this drama on hold while you go to work!  LOL",1408492800,3,312,5.14
8373945,4,B002MKWVNU,"It's sad that a good story with good acting, is stained with the homosexual agenda. It's one of the few Korean dramas I've seen, that kept my interest up until the 17th episode. The other ideas they threw in there, were animals fighting and killing each other, gambling, and the old argument that if it's art, then it's not pornography. What a joke. It is art and it is pornography. All of these ideas lead to actions that are harmful to the mind and body, not just yourselves, but other people and animals too.",1394841600,3,511,4.446808510638298
8373946,5,B002MKWVNU,"This was the first Korean TV drama series I watched and later purchased.  I have watched probably over 100 since then, but Painter in the Wind is still my benchmark  Both Moon Geun Young and Park Shin Yang play their roles very well, especially Geun Young who portrays a young man when, in fact, the actor is a woman. After seeing Painter in the Wind, Park Shin Yang has become one of my favorite actors; I have seen just about all his work since.

The story was intriguing, and I enjoyed seeing the real artwork of both Shin Yun Bok (Hyewon) and Kim Hong Do (Daewon).

I have seen this series, on average, at least once a year since purchasing it.",1391472000,7,648,4.330578512396694
8373947,4,B002MKWVNU,"The ending, well, I won't give it away as is my habit to not divulge anything important in the story which ruins it for othe viewers. It is well done and well acted. The times are very hard especially for women. Women are not supposed to be artists. Entertainers and wives is all that is open to them. A man plots to use the talents of the young child in his care, but what a sad life he forces on his own son in the process. This is a great series for the price. Amazon, please continue to add to the collection as I also watch a good deal on Prime. Amazon Prime is a real bargain that gives all year long!",1388275200,5,607,3.9836065573770494
8373948,5,B002MKWVNU,"I have told several friends about this film. As one person said: ""I just can't stop watching it!"" Even with so many episodes.
The story is excellent and the actors were great. Due to this excellent performance, I went on to see other films with them.
I so recommend this to all!",1368144000,4,278,4.365384615384615
8373949,5,B002MKWVNU,My wife enjoyed this DVD pkg. I also viewed all of the series utilizing the English sub-titles. Anyone married to a Korean with a DVD player would ennjoy this as a present to their wife.,1367712000,5,186,4.3428571428571425
