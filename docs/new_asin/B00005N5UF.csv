1628238,5,B00005N5UF,"My 27 mth old was not too interested the first time I put this DVD on, probably b'cos I had broken the usual routine of putting Fav. Songs 1. But after a few weeks & till now (it's been about 4-5 months) he really loves it. He likes the actions of the kids in the interviewing segment & does a very good job of imitating them. He is right on when identifying the next song to ""act"" out in the segments. Compared to Fav. Songs 1, there is more emphasis on real kid's opinions & what they think some of the song's words mean....older kids may enjoy that. Initially my son didn't like the ""non-musical"" parts but since he's starting to talk / communicate verbally, he shows much interest. Songs are good & known......personally I would say a good buy. If yr kids liked Fav. Songs 1, they will gradually enjoy this one (if not more).",1032480000,,829,4.32051282051282
1628239,4,B00005N5UF,"Actually, if you are  preschooler, this is a great video.  True, the Ant/Itsy Bisty Spider lady does grate my nerves and ""The Noble Duke of York"" is turned into a politically correct ""Captain Brown.""  But the video isn't suppose to appeal to adult- the target audiance are preschoolers.  And it works.  My three year son could watch it all day.  The songs are good, clean, children's classics. And there is a nice mix of girls/boys and ethnic children.  And I the ""extra"" skit after the credits is cute.  I would rank this a five star video except for all the advertisements at the end of the tape.",1015286400,2,598,4.5233644859813085
1628240,3,B00005N5UF,"This Sesame Street DVD is kind of disappointing.  We purchased for my 15-month old daugher.  She loves the Kids Favorite Songs 1, so we figured she would enjoy this one too.  Turns out that this one spends 1/3 of the time interviewing the kids so find out what they think things mean.  Example:  When they sing the song ""The Bear Went Over the Mountain"", they spend 2 minutes asking the kids where they think he went.  When they say the Nursery Rhyme ""Mary, Mary Quite Contrary"", they get some weird answers about what the kids think ""Cockshells"" are.
They have some of the kids put a tune to some of the nursery rhymes on here that I am not even sure were meant to be sung to any tune in particular....it kind of just ends of hurting your ears.
When they do get around to singing, it is actually ok.  ""The Bear Went Over the Mountain,"" and ""The Wheels on the Bus,"" are pretty good.
A lot of this video is just spent with kids poking at each other and acting silly/goofy at their own answers.  I probably wouldn't purchase it again.",1015200000,59,1032,4.338541666666667
1628241,4,B00005N5UF,"My daughter is in love with the Kid's Favorite Songs video, so we got this one for Christmas.  While there are some ""interview"" type things on the video that are a little annoying (kids talking about what things mean and what their favorite songs are) they still do not take away from the fun of this video.  ""The Bear Went over the Mountain"" and ""The Wheels on the Bus"" are definite favorites in my house.  This video, like it's predecessor, are fun and will have your kids singing and dancing for many many viewings!",1011571200,2,518,4.48936170212766

The keys change as they go from clip to clip, showing one group of kids singing the first line of something, then going to the next where a different group picks up the second line in a totally different key. It's not the video to teach your little ones actual songs, since the melodies are totally off.

The entire DVD is 40 minutes in length which is perfect - not too long so they lose interest and not so short that another DVD gets played immediately after.  Snuffy is an important recurring character, which really adds to the value since he doesn't get much attention on other Elmo videos.  My daughter loves all of the skits, and I don't mind watching it for 10x in as many days.

Unfortunately, it was not a winner in our house.  I was thinking that it would be muppets singing and dancing to favorite songs, but instead it was a compilation of cartoons, children singing parts of songs, and other things that did not catch our son's attention at all (and trust me, he loves movies and the TV especially Sesame Street).

Unfortunately, there are also a lot of uninspired songs/segments (particularly the cartoon ones)  that always lose my toddler's interest (e.g. a Spanish lullaby, captain brown (? anyone else never heard of that song before?), a jazzed-up nursery rhyme collage, a very boring itsy-bitsy spider, lots of talking among the puppets at the end). People have complained about all the live interview footage of real kids, but my little guy loves watching the kids (and so do I - they are adorable!). My issues are with the length (too long overall for my 15-month-old), the pacing (certain songs definitely outstay their welcome), and some poor song selection choices. Other than wandering away during the boring parts, he does love watching the live kids, Elmo, and certain songs.

1628357,4,B00005N5UF,"The first few times I watched this with my two year old, I was really annoyed by it.  As in, I wanted to give it away to someone I didn't like much so we wouldn't have to deal with it anymore.  There was way too much randomness compared to the first Kid's Favorite Songs - it cuts back and forth from Elmo to kids, to Elmo, to kids, to a skit, to kids, to this meatball storyline, etc.  It felt very disjointed.  And if you're expecting a Elmo-heavy video, you'll be disappointed - it's more random children talking about songs than anything else.  What Elmo does the most is walk around for a few seconds, say something, laugh, and point his video camera at you.

That being said....  When I left it alone for a while and then came back to it, I had a much better opinion...  I do like:
...that there are kids talking and singing the songs in their own way, however off-key they might be.  It's not as disjointed as I first thought it was, it just seemed that way because I was expecting something similar to the first Kid's Favorite Songs dvd.
...it felt almost like a tv episode v/s a miniature movie - it would have ""commercials"" that came up during breaks in the overall storyline (Snuffy loses his meatball.)
...there is enough kid-action in this one to involve the viewer (marching, hand movements, etc.)
...various themes were touched on - nursery rhymes, songs about animals, etc.
...it's not Elmo-heavy, and uses Rosita, and Baby Bear, and other characters to sing the songs.
...you get the entire On Top of Spaghetti song from Snuffy.  (That may not seem like a big deal, but I enjoyed it - when's the last time you heard the *whole* song?)
...a variety of song animations and skits (except the nursery rhyme one, that's still a little odd to me, but that's okay).  My two year old really enjoys the Bug Lady songs and the singing turtles.  (I like Little Bo Peep.)
...that there were songs I was unfamiliar with (Captain Brown, Follow Me), as well as the classics (Rubber Ducky, On Top of Spaghetti).
...That it ends with a (rather long) rousing rendition of Elmo's Song, which has led to my daughter singing ""La la la la (her name's) song"" at random times.

All in all, we've come to enjoy this dvd, and I've even ordered it as a gift for people (who I do like  :)",1347667200,3,2277,4.4033412887828165

1628362,4,B00005N5UF,"We bought this DVD because our hard to please 2 year old absolutely loves the first one, Kid's Favorite Songs.

Kid's Favorite Songs 2 consists of Elmo running around Sesame Street asking questions & recording kids talking about their favorite songs. Unlike the first, this DVD has a lot of cut scenes where children are talking about & singing parts of their favorite songs with no muppets in sight. The show then cuts into scenes where muppets sing the entire song the children were talking about. There is also a lot of cut scenes where strange cartoons are singing the songs instead of muppets.

I enjoyed watching Kid's Favorite Songs with my son, but Kid's Favorite Songs 2? Not so much. If it were up to me entirely, I would rate this rather low, but my son seems to enjoy it for the most part & adores the parts where Elmo is present, & that's what's important.",1330992000,,869,4.528662420382165

I'm sure he would give this a Five Star review.  I'm giving it four just because he loves it so much.  The story is actually clever as it follows Snuffy and his quest to find his giant meatball.  I am telling you though, the songs will get stuck in your head and you won't be able to get them out!  Imagine this: I was visiting my friends downtown and started humming the theme, ""Elmo's Song"".  They asked me what it was and I explained.

1628379,5,B00005N5UF,"I'm not sure where these complaints of ""too much talking"" are coming from; this video is 90% singing.  In my opinion, Kids' Favorite Songs 1 was much more guilty of that particular flaw than this one.

Anyway, my one-year-old LOVES music, and this has been the only video so far that he will sit through all the way.  Considering his minuscule attention span and the 45-minute running time of this DVD, that's a pretty big accomplishment.  He's seen it about twenty times and his face still lights up when he hears the video starting up.  He also laughs every time Snuffy chases his runaway meatball across the screen.  (Um, you'll understand when you see it...)

From my own viewpoint as a parent, even considering that I can be somewhat kids' music averse, I definitely can't complain that this is my son's favorite.  Sure, the songs do tend to get stuck in your head (God help me if I start singing Elmo's Song at work again), but it's not particularly annoying as these things sometimes are.  The selection of songs is great -- fun, with a combination of humorous and classic tunes, most of which I remember from my own childhood.  Some of the kids in the video are pretty cute and add more humor into the mix.

1628391,5,B00005N5UF,"This sequel to ""Kids Favorite Songs"" takes an approach in presentation that is different from the first, with Elmo using a video camera to interview children in order to find out what their favorite songs are. This brings an abundance of energy to the project and makes it seem more interactive than a simple, one-sided presentation. The songs are all performed well and the pace is brisk. Most of the songs are standard children's favorites, though ""Elmo's Song"" and ""Rubber Duckie"" are included as well. There is also a cute little side story, which begins with Snuffleupagus singing ""On Top of Old Smoky"" and has him chasing his meatball throughout the program. As with most Sesame Street videos, there is a good mixture of both vintage Sesame Street and new material, with Elmo being joined primarily by Zo and Baby Bear. Fortunately, Zo isn't featured as prominently here as she is in other videos because neither my kids nor I can stand to watch her for prolonged periods. At approximately fifty minutes, this one runs about twenty minutes longer than most other Sesame Street videos. Really my only complaint would be some of the editing, which sometimes disrupts the flow of action; there is a trifle too much back-and-forth. Even with this, my kids (ages one and three) really enjoy this one and one little girl, Wendy, is one of the cutest kids on the planet.  4.5/5 stars",1194912000,,1382,4.80672268907563

It's a little advanced for his age maybe he will grow into it but for younger kids the first definitely much better and easier to sing along too.,1173312000,,404,3.9390243902439024

She loves it and has learned all of the songs on the video.  Would think that most toddlers would enjoy this.,1167782400,,261,4.777777777777778
1628399,5,B00005N5UF,"This was my oldest son's favorite video for over a year - granted, he was pretty crazy about Elmo. Now, my younger son is hooked on it and my older one is enjoying it again two years later. The songs are catchy and both my sons learned them quickly and started singing them in the car. There are certain areas that both my sons found uninteresting, but over time, those areas have changed and they eventually like every scene. The meatball at the end almost squishing Elmo caused a little apprehension for both my son's at first, but the overall excitement and happy ending makes them giddy). There is a little bit of everything in this video including different styles of music, puns, counting, teasing and just plain silliness. Sesame Street delivers a great product once again and even improved on the first Kids Favorite Songs video.",1164672000,,837,4.700680272108843

I didn't like it at first (I watch them with her) and she didn't take to it too quickly, but she got a little older and now she loves it. She sings the songs and she likes seeing the other kids. Personally I think there is a little too much talking.",1150329600,,350,3.943661971830986
1628401,4,B00005N5UF,"I gave this a 4 star because it doesn't keep my child's attention as well as the other Sesame Street DVDs do.  It has popular kid's songs instead of original Sesame Street songs.  Also, there are lots of real people in it, instead of all Sesame Street characters.  It's still good, but not as good as others.",1138579200,2,308,4.368421052631579

There is a giant run away meatball from the ""on top of spaghetti"" song that appears thoughtout the show which scares him so much he doesn't even want his little sister to watch it.  I'll admit this is probably an extreme reaction but just wanted people to be aware that it could scare other kids.",1118102400,2,373,4.23943661971831
1628404,4,B00005N5UF,enough for 4 stars.  Actually he stays glued to the tv when I play it and he is only 5 months old.  I bought this in the VHS edition for $5.96 at Wal-mart to see how my son would like it since he seems enraptured with Sesame Street on PBS. I certainly agree with the other reviewers comments on the quality of the overall video and the amount of talking as opposed to music.  However this does not seem to bother my son and since he loves it I gave it 4 stars for that reason. I have already gotten my money's worth out of this video and it is a good one to begin with if you can pick it up cheap.,1112227200,,597,3.83739837398374
1628405,5,B00005N5UF,"My 18 month old absolutely ADORES this video and it is by far his favorite!  He loves watching the kids talk - but loves all the music, skits, and singing.  His favorite thing to do is call out ""NO! Meatball!""  As an adult viewer of this video, a couple of the kids become almost too annoyingly painful to watch....""Jack and Jill were probably English"", ""Ants don't have thumbs"", and then the little boy on the ""If your happy and you know it..."" bit burdens viewers with a completely awful display of over acting.  Most importantly though, it encourages my son to verbalize new words, and with him in the running as Elmo's biggest fan - it is a great great DVD.",1110067200,,661,4.43801652892562
1628406,5,B00005N5UF,"...if that tells ya anything.

My 20 month old absolutely goes nuts over this DVD.  We bought it for her the day after we bought our new minivan with the DVD player.  She was not yet 18 months.  This is her favorite DVD, and she always ask for this one.  I've purchased other Sesame Street DVDs and other characters' DVDs, but she begs for this one by singing, ""La la la la Olivia's song"".  She sings along to most of the songs now and she hasn't had it that long.  My favorite part is the Mother Goose Jamboree.  It's jazzy...  I love it.

I particularly like the little kids talking and singing, and I think my daughter does, too.  I even like the little Asian girl who says that Jack and Jill are ""probably English"".  All kids have their own personalities and it's sweet to see them express themselves.  My only complaint is that there aren't any southerners on the show (wink wink).",1109462400,,886,4.361963190184049

Her favorite part is Snuffy singing ""On Top of Spaghetti"" and when the meatball falls off the plate she throws her hands in the air and yells, ""oh no!""  And then she starts ""sneezing"".  She does loose interest somewhere in the middle but it provides me with a great distraction for her while I make dinner.",1108425600,,474,4.413793103448276

Yes, there are some annoying moments...especially the precocious little one who says about Jack and Jill ""they were probably British"" and the same little girl who interrupts ""Ants go Marching"" by reminding us that ""ants don't have thumbs"".

This is the only video she askes to watch. Out of all our Barney, Baby Einstein, Noodlebug, etc...

I have to admit I may like some of the segments more than her.

The 1st time I watched it, I laughed so hard during (Baby Bear) ""the bear goes over the mountain"", my little peanut kept looking at me because she couldn't hear the tv. And I really like ""the ants go marching..."". Trust me, it's not just me, my daughter loves it too! ;)",1093651200,,494,4.125

I thought he wouldnt like all the kids who sing their favorite songs, but I think he likes to watch the  other kids.  It has a lot of great songs to sing along with and it taught me some new ones to sing with him too. I find Sesame STreet a good learning tool for those who allow their children to watch tv.  Obviously, its worked in my case since my son repeats things he sees on the show. Highly

recommended by a greatful mom.

In the beginning he liked the show but as he got a little older he became afraid of the run away meatball that keeps appearing throughout the show which at the end almost gets elmo. Now when I put it on I have to skip the part where the meatball almost flattens elmo.
He loves sesame street now but is still scarred of that meatball. If you get this for your child watch their reaction and don't let them get scarred  buy it. My son is now afraid of anything that is coming toward him.",1087948800,,577,4.017391304347826

They spent most of the time showing kids singing off-key and mumbling the lyrics, Elmo barely sang anything!  THe only good parts in this DVD probably only lasted 15 minutes (the actually singing parts).  I would NOT recommend this DVD at all!",1073347200,3,437,4.64935064935065

However, I wish I had read all the comments more carefully before buying it, especially the low-rated stars. The picture on the DVD cover is misleading as it suggests that the content of the DVD will be about puppets singing songs. In reality, the great majority of the songs come with a cartoon background (except for Mary had a little lamb, Ernie Rubber Ducky, and Elmo Itsy Bisty Spider songs). I was also disapointed by the kids interviews from the ""Alley"" (actually recorded in a pink and blue studio with no puppets) because they make too long of intervals between the songs for my daughter short attention span. As content, it is about 50% cartoons, 20% of Elmo or other puppets and 30% of kids singing bits of songs (as regular kids do). I would recommend the CD instead for the good selection and lively songs.",1073347200,,954,4.617647058823529

Also, she can now decipher up from down (because of the song ""The Brave ole' Captiain Brown"")  I am a Kindergarten teacher and this video truely gives toddlers a good foundation to the basics of education.

My daughter is 9 months old and she loves this video more than anything in the world.  She won't even stop to look at me when I call her name sometimes (that's how much she's so interested watching these other children like herself on tv singing her favorite familiar songs).

(This video is also one of my 14 mos old niece's favorites.)  Also, now that he is older and is curious about other children, he likes to watch the children being interviewed.  As with most Sesame Street music, the songs are arranged beautifully and some of the arrangements are pretty sophisticated.  There is a little more humor for adults in this one than #1 so watching it for the 50th time doesn't make you want to pull your hair out (how can you not laugh when the Mary puppet of ""Mary had a little lamb"" fame admonishes her lamb in a Scottish brogue?).  Also, the video includes an episode of Hero Guy, which is always fun.  (By the way, if your child is young (3-6 mos.), s/he probably will not be able to watch for more than 5 to 10 minutes at a time because of their short attention spans.)",1043107200,5,978,4.225806451612903

Then she warmed up to it about the 3rd time we watched it and has become the one that makes her smile, laugh, and point (so cute!) the most.  She loves listening to and watching the kids Elmo interviews about the songs and of course all the great parts with Elmo.
