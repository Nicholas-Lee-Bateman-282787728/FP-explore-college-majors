3620489,5,B001GTRPPM,"This is a great CD depicting the real Lane Frost and his friends. It tells the real story of Lane and his friends unlike the twisted version of ""8 Seconds"" (Movie) Unfortunately I was there when this tragic accident occured. I'll never forget that evening. Lane was one of the greatest athletes and persons of all time. This CD brings out the real life and times of Lane. He can never be replaced and his memory will go on in this household and the CD is kept at finger tip to review to all who wish to see.

3620501,5,B001GTRPPM,"Lane Frost(October 12,1963-July 30,1989).'American Cowboy' magizine Dec/Jan 2014 has Lane Frost on the cover, a very nice article. This year 2013 would have been Lane's 50th. He has been ""asleep in death"" nearly 25 years. My best friend and his brother,we knew Lane well esp. in the rodeo arena. We were at Cheyenne Frontier Days and witnessed his death. That was one of the most heartbreaking day/events in the rodeo world. I am so glad we had Lane in our lives. I will always remember his smile,those eyes and his laugh. Also my most favourite memory is him wearing that red and white stripped shirt. He was one of a kind. Scripture tells us ""not to mourn as the rest do with no hope"",""we know that there is going to be an earthly resurrection of the dead"" soon when God's Kingdom in the hands of Christ Jesus take over man's affairs. It will be a pleasure to welcome him back and let him know that his legacy lived on after his passing. This dvd is a wonderful tribute to him.",1382659200,,979,4.444444444444445
3620502,5,B001GTRPPM,"The movie came quickly so I did not have to worry about time, as this was a Christmas gift for my father. He has told me how he enjoys watching it and have had no problems with the dvd. I would recommend this seller and this product.",1357603200,,233,3.978723404255319
3620503,5,B001GTRPPM,"The product that was bought was wonderful and the description from the seller was perfect. However, the shipping took forever.

I don't think the product was shipped when the seller said it was shipped. This is by far the longest item it took to get to me. I have bought from Amazon plenty of times and nothing has ever taken this long for me to receive. I will not do business again because of the shipping.",1299456000,,408,4.368421052631579
3620504,1,B001GTRPPM,"personally i give this a zero rating, but at least one star is required by amazon. this DVD is offensive beyond belief. torturing live stock for enjoyment is just plain sick. why anyone would bother wasting time making this movie or watching it is a mystery.  rodeo is an antiquated abusive form of entertainment enjoyed by folks who don't know any better. not all people who live in the country and are ranchers are this ignorant. just the ones in this film. the people in this film have nothing to say about anything, except how much they enjoy being cruel to animals. their obnoxious and often incoherent ramblings do not pass as anything close to interesting. the so-called story is impossible to follow due to the amateurish editing, dreadful cinematography, and utter barbaric behavior of the subjects.  it all comes across as a home-made project by an 8 year old w/ his first camera. let's hope rodeo follows lynching into extinction.",1291075200,,941,4.838509316770186
3620505,5,B001GTRPPM,"Let me say right off the bat that I am totally biased towards this documentary - but then, what happened was part of my life and I'm in it. Aside from that - it's the real story of Lane and Red Rock and a lot of other people. When 8 Seconds came out 20 years ago or so, I was mostly amazed at how much Luke Perry looked like Lane sometimes - I thought he and the other actors did a great job....  it wasn't but a few years after Lane had died and it was a Hollywood version of what happened - they got some of the characters totally wrong - including Red Rock!!! and I think I was still pretty raw - it made me too sad to watch it. Except that they used some of my photos in the credits and if you wait until the very last Reba song is over you can see my name along with other photographers whose photos were used in the credits. David's film ""Challenge of the Champions"" isn't the Hollywood version.. it's what really happened - with real people talking about how they really felt and feel now - including me. If you loved 8 Seconds, do yourselves a favor and see this one too.  There is a lot of actual footage of bull riding and interviews Lane did with George Michael, as well as interviews with John Growney who owned Red Rock; Kendra Santos who was writing for the ProRodeo Sports News at the time and now runs the show; Jacki Romer who was one of the first Justin Sports medical trainers on the road and who worked with Lane as well as anyone else who needed sports medical assistance; me - the itinerant rodeo photographer who started all that by doing her Master's thesis at UC Berkeley in photography on the sport and culture of professional rodeo, since it was a culture she knew nothing about to begin with - who ended up being Lane and Red Rock's PR person - and later worked with John and Growney Brothers Rodeo Company; Tuff Hedeman and Cody Lambert, Lane's travelling partners and co-competitors; Lane's folks Clyde and Elsie Frost; George Michael of George Michael Sports Machine and others.",1281830400,13,2009,4.3121693121693125
3620506,5,B001GTRPPM,It was a nice story. I didn't know that Lane and Red Rock had a history with each other. It was a tremendous tragedy but unfortunately when you ride bulls for a living there's always a chance of injury or death!,1268784000,3,211,4.170731707317073
3620507,5,B001GTRPPM,"(*see note below)
This DVD is an outstanding documentary that all Rodeo, especially PBR, enthusiasts will want to have in their collection. The life story of the legendary bull rider Lane Frost is told by those who knew him best, the family and friends who surrounded him during his brilliant though brief career.
Using live action footage, interviews with his parents, cowboys who were both his companions and competitors,  folks at the core of the Rodeo Industry and the reporter who chronicled his journey, World Champion Bull Rider Lane Frost's life story unfolds before your eyes. Interwoven is the story of World Champion Bucking Bull Red Rock and how their parallel paths intersected to become 'The Challenge of Champions!' (Be sure to have a box of Kleenex handy!)

* The movie ""8 Seconds"" was based on Lane Frost's life story)",1249862400,3,835,4.957142857142857
3620508,5,B001GTRPPM,Service was great but the DVD was even better.  You felt like you stepped into Lane's life for a moment.  He definitely left an imprint in my heart.  :),1244160000,,152,4.172413793103448
3620509,5,B001GTRPPM,"This DVD is awesome! I thought I knew Lane Frost when I watched the movie ""8 Seconds,"" but after watching this documentary about the real Lane Frost, I see that Hollywood had their version and then there was the real version. The film takes through his ealy life and career and intertwines it with the life of the bull and his competitor, Red Rock. Anyone who loves bull riding and wants to see the best bull rider there ever was, has to get this video for their collection. There are many rodeo videos out there but few you want to have in a collection, this is one of them.",1239580800,2,575,4.284403669724771
