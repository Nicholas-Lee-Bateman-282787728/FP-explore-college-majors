7070868,3,B00USBLXZC,Interesting but strange & the effects weren't that great. I also got tired of seeing the guy running around in his tank shirt & underwear lol. But overall it was okay to me.,1432857600,,173,4.2727272727272725
7070869,4,B00USBLXZC,"This was a dark, depressing film about a mad genius and his assistant. The thing that is enclosed in glass is suppose to be the source of a vaccine that will destroy all types of terrible diseases. When he injects himself, he starts changing. First to praise his assistant, then to verbally trash her in a mad rant. She has enough and leaves, but keeps coming back. The plot takes on a different mode than just the ""mad scientist"" type, but delivers good acting and some spine tingling scenes of what happens when we explore the scientific unknown....and pay a terrible price. The only criticism I have is that it was slow moving.",1432425600,,630,4.584070796460177

7070871,3,B00USBLXZC,"Had to waver between the 2 stars or 3 stars.  Really...it's a 2 1/2 - but it doesn't seem as if Amazon will let me do a half star.  So.  Well.  I watched the whole thing - which is more than I can say for the movie DEMONIC that I TRIED to watch before this one.  (for future reference avoid DEMONIC)

This movie is one of those that is slightly maddening because the things that are wrong with it - or at least MAJORLY wrong with it - are such easy fixes.  I found myself wanting to do some re-shoots and edits - et voila!

We get rid of the turkey.  Yes - the monster looks like a turkey - a roasted, browned turkey and there is no way around it.  I am a little baffled as to why the special effects team didn't just go for the viscous, gooey thing - put on enough goo and it works.  ISOLATION is a GREAT horror movie and it relies on goo.  And later it's a turkey with?  Cocktail olives?  Moldy tater tots?  Oh, and there is Home Depot ventilation duct taped to the turkey.

Aside from the turkey - kudos indeed to practical effects.  I love seeing practical effects and the make-up work was also excellent.

The second problem is bigger than the turkey and that's the lead actress.  Every time she was on the screen I wondered if I was going to make it until the end of this one.  She might be fine in a totally different role - but buying the airhead tramp sporting the t-shirt emblazoned with ""HOOKER"" didn't really scream out ""brilliant scientist"".  Also, her lone scientific skill seem to be holding an old video camera with her manicured hand.  Sorry, but I kept wondering whose girlfriend is she - or what financing did she help bring - because it didn't seem possible that she was cast because she was perfect for this part. Yeesh.  The good news is I quite liked the lead actor.  His transformation in the film is starting and done mostly with simple acting technique - posture, voice, etc.  I liked him enough that it made me endure his leading lady.

I don't want to spoiler here - but if you read the log line - you get the idea.  It's a vampire movie that's got a bit of THE FLY tossed in - definitely nods here and there to Cronenberg's body horror.  There are a couple of fresh ideas even.  I liked a lot of the dream/vision quick inserts.  There is some good imagery.  There are some gross out moments.  It's not a scary film - but it is creepy in that body horror way.  Lastly - we need a new ending.

So...I can't suggest you spend your money to rent this - unless you've seen all the great, good, so-so horror movies. (a place I seem to have reached).  Like the other reviewer, I came here because of reading about it on Bloody Disgusting.  I am willing to roll the dice.  I don't regret watching it.  I think I'd give the director another chance.  I definitely hope the lead actor gets work.  If you come across this film for free - I'd say that's a more prudent choice - like if it's on cable one night, etc.",1431388800,11,2931,4.192100538599641

7070874,2,B00USBLXZC,"The first half hour of this movie is like watching someone baste a turkey.  No really, this guy creates a creature that looks like a thanksgiving dinner to save the world.  If it was about vampires in the second half i didn't get that far because the boring dialogue put me to sleep.  Gets 2 stars because i didn't watch the whole thing to see if it got better.",1430611200,2,361,4.202898550724638
7070875,4,B00USBLXZC,"I was able to catch Strange Blood prior to its official release on Amazon, and I have to say it was worth taking a rental risk on (BloodyDisgusting.com has a great review that actually sold me on finding and renting this one).

The film tells the story of a doctor (and, notably, his assistant and nascent love interest) who is seeking the cure to cancer and other diseases, and is inadvertantly infected with the very genetic material he intended to use to heal mankind. As he evolves - or devolves - we watch as he turns on those he loves, and the carnage begins. :)  I did have one issue, and that was with the source of the virus from which the doc and his team planned to extract the fluid looks like something no sane person would get remotely close to - as if they created the creepiest possible ""guinea pig"" - I'd have thought that'd have served as a good warning to stay away... But, that's a minor point, ultimately.

This reminded me a bit of 2005's ""Isolation,"" a great Irish horror film.

Oh, and a big kudos to the practical special effects team, by the way!

I'm honestly very, very wary about zombie and vampire movies, as they've been done (pardon the pun) to death ever since Twilight's shiny-sparkly Teen Beat-vamps arose to plague the literary and movie world.

So, I have to say, I was quite happy to see a film with some originality amidst all the banal, overdone garbage that we are presented on what seems to be a weekly basis. Strange Blood is definitely worth a rental, no matter where you find it - here, or on Vudu, etc.",1430179200,20,1548,4.414035087719299

8708054,2,B00USBLXZC,"I was so looking forward to an offbeat vampire flick, but I'm going to have to agree somewhat with the reviewer who simply wrote ""Man is bitten by a foam rubber likeness of a colon in a fishbowl attached to flexible air conditioning duct which makes him want to kill."" In fairness, the bowel in a tank is only the genesis of the troubles faced by the two protagonists, one who becomes deeply disturbed and vampiric, the other who remains mortal for longer, desiring to impose salvation on the mad scientist.
Strange Blood reminds me of something you would see at a science fiction short film festival; the problem here is that it isn't short.

ACTORS
Man. I'm going to be unkind and state that Robert Brettenaugh was probably not born to be an actor. He is better in Strange Blood after he shaves his head, but mostly because he looks awkward and truly stark raving mad to fit the part (too bad he couldn't match it with convincing thespianism). There's a somewhat fine line between coming off as a madman and looking like you're trying to pull it off; unfortunately, his performance was over the top.

Woman. Alexandra Bard does well with what she was given, but warming up to her occurs only after a quarter hour of acclimating to the anemic script and vibe of Strange Blood. You may or may not feel empathy with her character at times, but you'll also lose respect once too often, which leaves you in no particular mood to continue watching Strange Blood. This is an actress worth looking out for in future productions (I would watch her already released shorts if I could find them).

PLOT
Simple, and mostly shot at one location (barely qualifying as a disjointed movie set). The whole idea of how a vampire might be created by something other than another vampire was at least an ounce of originality. Prepare yourself to be fine with extensive scenes of the doc flitting back and forth in his tighty-whities, which are often dirty in spots that make you cringe. A fun aspect of the plot is in the last minute AFTER the closing credits, so be sure to watch that (if you can make it to the closing credits).

SCRIPT
Not worth mentioning. I've seen worse, but that's about the best praise I can offer. The ""love story"" is just horrible in every way. There's one good line Alexandra Bard proffers at a diner: ""If you can't have dessert for dinner, what's the point of being an adult?""

CINEMATOGRAPHY
The saving grace of Strange Blood, if you are charitable enough to recognize it, is competent and even creative cinematography. There are flashes of inspiration, but more instances of ideas that don't pan out (such as the use of red lighting). In the beginning, you might say ""Oh no, not another found footage movie!"" Not to worry: it isn't one (that's only a gimmick to get to the real story).

ADULT FACTOR
Male and female nudity, sex scenes, coarse language, abusive/violent behavior, and bloodshed.

EXTRA FEATURES
None. The nail in the coffin for low budget flicks like this is when they couldn't be bothered to put anything on the DVD other than the feature film. An interview with Alexandra Bard or Robert Brettenaugh would have been choice, or even one with the filmmaker (discussing for instance where the ideas came from, what challenges were encountered during shooting, etc.; such details are of interest to film buffs even when the movie is not good).

Final Thoughts: I paid $10 for Strange Blood and Strangely I don't regret it, probably because I collect vampire films (no matter how bad). For the casual viewer, however, you'd need to *really* like vampire and/or bizarre films to justify this price.",1441324800,,3621,4.691338582677165
