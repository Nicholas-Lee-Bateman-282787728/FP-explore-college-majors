1637891,5,B00005NX1B,"Both of these films are excellent!  ""The Miracle Maker"" is great for young and old.  It is fascinating to watch the 3D animation.  USA Today called it ""MIRACULOUS"" and I agree. I intend to purchase enough copies of this to give one to each of my 5th grade religion students.  ""In the Beginning"" appeals to an older audience.  It is the best film I have viewed depicting many of the main figures of the Old Testament. I'll probably give this film to my students to give to their parents!  I don't mind giving my money to the people who make films like this.",1085616000,3,556,4.349514563106796
1637892,5,B00005NX1B,"In the beginning is one of best bible epics made in a longtime and now you can get a bonus DVD of the Story of Jesus with it.
In the beginning takes the books of Genesis and Exodus and portrays them in a series of family episodes through the lives of Abraham, Issac, Jacob, Joseph and Moses.
A first class production worth buying.",1014595200,7,330,4.253968253968254

child fell asleep during this movie.",1401840000,,127,3.923076923076923
1637904,5,B00005NX1B,"The first story i bought from the ""Under Gods Rainbow series was THE PROPHETS."" My children (8,6, and 3) loved it. they watched it so much they could even recite every word said. It has helped me teach the children about out faith in a way that i could never have done myself. I even watch it sometimes and it helps me with the specifics of names and places and times in the Bible. its a must have for very home. We all love this DVD and I have currently placed an order for 5more",1387411200,,480,4.063157894736842
1637905,1,B00005NX1B,"This is very disappointing. The recount from the Bible is less than accurate and the way the animation is done is also quite confusing. I was looking for an animated version of the creation story, but this only focused on Cain & Abel and the tower of Babel. There are fairly long opening sequences without any talking just music, so I was concerned that the audio overlay was bad. It turned out to be fine. Even for my 5 yr old who loves her Bible stories this did not hold her interest like the Nest DVDs do.
I completely regret this purchase.",1386374400,6,544,4.3431372549019605
1637906,5,B00005NX1B,I loved this cartoon especially watching it as an adult. I like the fact that even a child can understand the meaning. The concept is simple but entertaining!,1384992000,,158,4.678571428571429
1637907,5,B00005NX1B,It was Biblically based and the kids and I all found it interesting.  It was long enough to get some meat out of it.,1382745600,,116,3.8333333333333335
1637908,2,B00005NX1B,"Our 3-year old loves the video, however, I will not show it to her again - there are too many things inaccurate.
In the Cain & Abel one, Adam was not an old man at the time Cain slew Abel.  After Abel was dead, Adam and Eve had another son Seth.  At that time Adam still had over 700 more years to live.  They did not eat meat before the flood, so that was inaccurate, also.

In the Tower of Babel, they added a blind man who prophesied about the coming destruction of the tower... and I don't remember reading about him anywhere in the Bible.

I wish there was a Bible Cartoon series of equal quality - but accurate.

I highly recommend previewing the videos on YouTube before buying the DVD on Amaon.",1373068800,6,702,4.201492537313433
1637909,5,B00005NX1B,I needed more DVD's to show to children at church.  This one was interesting and well done.  I was glad to find it.,1369699200,,115,3.9565217391304346

1637911,2,B00005NX1B,"This movie is entertaining. If you are looking for a fairly accurate Bible story you will not find it here. I know my Bible and these Bible stories leave much out and add words of the film maker.  I have purchased all of them, and in two so far they contain a swear word. Dammit in the story of Saul and Damn in another video. I have not noticed any other swear words, but even one swear word makes is too many to share with my Grandchildren or anyone else. It is obvious that the film makers do not hold any respect for Biblical accuracy. The graphics and music are good. I wish there were more good children's Bible videos around. My husband and I watched the story of David last night. They put people in different places than where the Bible says there were. They have David stabbing Goliath in the chest when he cut off his head in reality. They do not put the true words that David spoke right before David killed Goliath which is important, because it was David's faith in God that killed the Giant. They really made a big mess of the most important part of the story that you would want your children to remember. The Bible is a special book and each word is true and maybe we should just stick to reading God's word to our kids instead of trying to entertain them and us with pictures.  These filmakers are based in Italy, and produce other secular videos as well. I am disappointed but I can't say I am surprised. I was hoping for much better.",1302480000,27,1453,4.28
1637912,4,B00005NX1B,"The Miracle Maker is great, very well done.  Nevertheless, a friend of mine previewed ""In the Beginning"" and promptly threw it away for me after finding the Adam and Eve scenes a little too realistic...",1213401600,,202,4.771428571428571

7948017,5,B00005NX1B,Good Stories for teaching kids. My kids love these movies and they learn from the stories. Helps them to visualize the Bible. I highly recommend this series is the most accurate I have found and is neutral on Christian religions.,1483747200,,229,4.75

7948019,2,B00005NX1B,"This movie is very hard to understand unless you have a through understanding of what happens. It was very hard to follow the characters since they are mostly unknowns. I had my grandson, who is 11, watch it with me. I ended up explaining what was happening. It would have been better if I just told him the story. I gave it 2 stars because there was one recognizable actor.",1458777600,,374,4.357142857142857
7948020,5,B00005NX1B,"I bought the entire collection of both the Old Testament Bible Stories for Children, and the New Testament series as well. Although the Japanese-based animation is the same in both series, the flow of the storytelling and the music soundtrack is much better in the Old Testament series (although I must admit that on some of the DVDs, the story could have been shortened by 5 minutes or so). Both series are geared towards children, and it is the reason why the violence and attempted rape scenes were removed but still referred to, so that the view understands the context of the story. This is a great series for children to watch and learn about the Old Testament. It is a useful teaching tool for parents, especially if each DVD is purchased for $5 or less.",1437264000,,761,4.602941176470588
