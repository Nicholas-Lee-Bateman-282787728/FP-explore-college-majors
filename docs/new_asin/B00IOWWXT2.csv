8644301,5,B00IOWWXT2,"If you're looking for the typical overproduced Christmas spectacular, this isn't it.  If you're looking for great choirs singing classic American (and a few Norwegian) Christmas carols in a gorgeous setting (Norway's one great medieval Gothic cathedral), this is wonderful.  The perfect DVD to have on the TV during a quiet holiday evening.",1480809600,2,340,5.39622641509434

8644303,5,B00IOWWXT2,"I totally agree with the above review. This is a fabulous concert, one of the best I've ever seen on PBS. I totally fell in love with this group of incredibility talented young people. The music is deeply moving.",1402444800,3,212,4.461538461538462

That being said, this recording is one of the most phenomenal choral settings I have ever heard.  The visual artistry is beautiful, the video production is first class, and the audio mixing is top notch.  I love John Ferguson's arrangements of many of the ""old favorites"" of Christmas.  Year after year we hear the same Christmas music.  John's arrangements bring new life to beautiful music that is often getting stale or over-done.  The St. Olaf Choir and Nidarosdomen Jentekor (the all girls resident choral group from the Nidaros Cathedral) compliment each other beautifully.  Each group performs solo pieces and they combine for several pieces.  I have watched/listened to this recording (I have the Blue-Ray version) many times since Christmas 2013 and still find something new each time.  My particular favorites are Carolyn Jennings' Climb to the Top of the Highest Mountain, Kim Andre Arnesen's ""Cradle Hymn"", Daniel Kantor's ""Night of Silence/Silent Night"" arranged by John Ferguson, Craig Hella Johnson's ""Lo, How a Rose e'er Blooming/The Rose"" and F. Melius Christiansen's Silesian Folk Tune arrangement ""Beautiful Savior"".  Also, be sure to listen to the bonus tracks where each choir performs a solo piece.  Of particular note is a third track of a combined piece written by Kim Andre Arnesen, ""Even When He is Silent"".  The words were found in a Nazi Concentration Camp following WWII.  This piece is so hauntingly beautiful.  Although I have listened many times, I still find myself fighting back tears each time I listen to it.  I was fortunate enough to hear the St. Olaf Choir perform this piece an impromptu concert at Boe Chapel on the St. Olaf campus last December for the vicar of Nidaros Cathedral and Kim Andre Arnesen who were visiting St. Olaf for the St. Olaf College annual Christmas Festival.  The power and emotions conveyed were indescribable.  I do not know how the St. Olaf Choir members performed this composition at each of their concert stops in Norway last summer and still maintained their composure for the remained of the concert.

This DVD or DVD/Blue-Ray recording should definitely be a certain buy for anyone who loves choral music at it's finest.",1393545600,12,2377,5.0487179487179485
