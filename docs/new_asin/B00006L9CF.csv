7971211,1,B00006L9CF,"I was excited to see a fair, intellectual approach to debating this subject. First of all, shame on William F. Buckley for participating in this video. He utters barely a few dozen words as ""the moderator"" and reads notes that were given to him. The 'debate' takes place in a Church in front of a fundamentalist congregation. The minister who introduces the program makes sure to mention Jesus Christ as Lord & Savior. Very cleverly, the producers chose an inarticulate unknown author to defend the non-existence of God - and a savvy, well-rehearsed fundamentalist speaker to defend the existence of God - who by all accounts must be Jesus Christ. Christian Fundamentalists will enjoy this film, but anyone looking for an objective, intelligent debate between two scholars should forget about wasting their time on this brilliant piece of religious propaganda.",1234915200,,860,5.15
