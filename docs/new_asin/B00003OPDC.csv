7919198,5,B00003OPDC,"As a member of the Handel's Messiah in Bethlehem performance, I can say that singing the Messiah that evening in Bethlehem was a once in a lifetime experience that still fills me with emotion.  I can't really describe this unique event, other than to say it was a blessing to sing such wonderful praise in that unbelievable setting with the Camerata Nuove.  With international diplomats and high officials inside and the Israeli military protecting the outside, a remarkable vitality and passion for the message flowed throughout the Chapel.  I will never forget the climax of the Hallelujah Chorus - time seemed to stop for a brief moment, just long enough to file in the mind's eye forever!  Truly inspired!  What's amazing is that that feeling comes through in the video.  It's a must for any holiday collection!  I highly recommend it.  I and my family watch it several times a year, no matter the season.  I know you will enjoy it over and over again.  Thank you, Maestro Francisco for the chance to be part of this historic masterpiece...",982195200,4,1044,4.782122905027933
