All of the actors did very well and I was glad to see George Kennedy again. Good movie.",1344816000,,197,4.076923076923077
2252333,5,B0007YUVWQ,"This picture opened in New York City on December 12 1980 starring Lee Majors as Mike Cattan, the very lovely Jennifer O'Neill as Cass Cassidy, Art Carney as Pignose Moran, Harris Yulin as Eddie Cassidy, George Kennedy as Big Lou Cassidy and Redmond Gleeson as Harry. Big Lou Cassidy is a millionaire who likes to big tall buildings all the country. This time he's putting up a building in downtown Houston Texas. Big Lou takes no bull **** from anyone especially his workers. One day when he gets to work he pulls up driving his limo because his driver gets to many tickets only to find his workers ready to fight each other. There to meet him is Pignose Moran who is good friends with Lou and has been helping Lou for years. So Lou gets on his hard hat, and starts to the top of the building with a new kid and there going to set some steel pillars. Lou tells someone to get him a welder so he can weld two pieces together because the bolt won't set right. When Lou starts the welding there's and explosion on the top floor which has one man frozen and won't let go. Lou goes over to try to help him when another explosion goes off sending Big Lou to his Death. Along comes Cass Cassidy Big Lou's daughter who comes to the funeral. After the funeral, Cass and Pignose get together to talk about what she's going to do next. Pignose tells Cass that she has three weeks to get nine floors added on to this tower. Along comes Mike Cattan who used to work was a steel worker many years ago until he froze on top of a building and ever since then he's been driving a truck. One day while going down the highway driving his rig Cattan hears someone beeping a horn at him and they want him to pull over. So Cattan pulls over only to find out that the gorgeous lady in the red sports car was Big Lou's daughter Cass. Cass tells Mike that she needs his help because Pignose told her that he was the best. Cass tells him that she needs nine more floors added to that building and she has only three weeks to do it. Does Cass get her man? Why is Lou's Brother Eddie upset with his sister Cass? Does Cattan get the men that he needs to get this job done? And finally do they get this steel put together before the banks comes knocking? I love this movie because it was field with action, adventure, and drama that kept you on your sits to the very end. I think Lee Majors was great in his role and George Kennedy was as good as ever. However, the person that caught my interest was Jennifer O'Neill. She was gorgeous in this movie and she defiantly can act. She also had spunk when it came to keeping her men in line. Because of Jennifer O'Neill and that beautiful body I give this movie 10 weasel stars. One bite of trivia from this movie Stuntman A.J. Bacons died while doubling for George Kennedy in a fall that killed Kennedy's character. The scene had been shot safely with the stunt man jumping from the ninth floor of the construction site/shooting location in Lexington, KY. At the time he held the record for high falls, set while doubling Burt Reynolds in Hooper (1978), but when rival Dar Robinson later beat his distance in a helicopter jump at Knott's Berry Farm, A. J. and Lee Majors returned to the star's home state to re-shoot the opening of the movie with Bakunas actually jumping from the top of the building. He fell correctly onto an airbag, but the airbag split on impact. His father was with him at the time of his death, but his mother never visited A. J. on set because she always feared he would be killed. Ironically, the completed structure, Kincaid Towers, became home to a life insurance company that eventually went bankrupt.",1233446400,7,3645,4.346041055718475
2252334,5,B0007YUVWQ,"The Six Million Dollar Man plays The man of Steel.  How perfect is that?!  This movie took a place in Lee Majors' actual home town Kentucky.  It was reported that they used actual under the construction building (Kincaid Tower) at the time and build the set on top roof of Eastern Kentucky University building for the shooting.

This was not critically claimed nor big box office hit, and yet it is the one of the best action drama Majors ever produced and stared.  Steel surely shines in his life long acting career.  It defines what kind of actor he was, and he had great qualities to play this type of role (well, best or worst).  He was man's man, but not in egoistic way.  He was the kind of the guy let his action speak itself,  tough in both physically and mentally, and yet vulnerable, respect and honor his friends,  trying to do the right thing.

Mike Catton (Lee Majors) as foreman gathers craziest crews in skyscraper business to fight against all odds to finish up the building to meet the deadline.  It is race against time!  I still love this 70's ultimate guy movie because it portraits what real American men were used to be like.

Majors made a couple of films such as Agency with late Robert Mitchum and The last Chase with Late Burgess Meredith after Steel.  Those two films did not take off, and Majors came back with huge success of TV Fall Guy.

Finally, Lee Majors was not the only man of Steel in this movie.  Steel features other men of Steel.  Academy Award winners: Art Carney (Harry & Tonto) and George Kennedy (Cool Hand Luke)  The film was dedicated for A.J. BAKUNIS who did stunt for George Kennedy's free fall scene from top of the building.

Steel is one of the 70's infamous movie that should be available on DVD.",1201737600,8,1748,4.4715189873417724
2252335,4,B0007YUVWQ,"I have been looking for a copy of this film for along time. Two of my cousins played extras in the movie. They got to attend the premire in Lexington and said it was the best thing they ever did. One of my cousins is now passed away, so it makes it even more of a family keepsake. I showed it to my dad on Sunday and he pointed out some of the senses that I missed my cousins in. I can't wait to sit down with my cousin and watch it again. The copy my dad had disappeared years ago and no one had been able to find the movie until I found it here. I'm glad you enjoyed the movie premire.",1176768000,,587,3.7804878048780486
2252336,4,B0007YUVWQ,"I attended the premiere of Steel in my hometome, Lexington, Ky., the city where it was filmed.  My late husband, an ironworker, and I, both worked for the company that performed the steel erection for Kincaid Tower, the building used as the centerpiece for this quite interesting film and the firm listed in the credits.  We knew many of the 'real' ironworkers who worked as uncredited extras on the film.

The premiere was held at a vintage Lexington theater and was attended by several of the stars including Lee Majors (Mike Catton) and Terry Kiser (Valentino).  A reception held at Kincaid Tower was also attended by many of the stars.  Phyllis George Brown, first-lady in Kentucky at the time and former Miss Texas and Miss America, was hostess and mistress of ceremonies for the film's opening.

Lee Majors, whose hometown was Middlesboro, KY, played football for and graduated from Eastern Kentucky University 26 miles from Lexington, in effect 'came home' to make this film.  Several of my friends attended college with Lee, but I had never met him.  I recall being very surprised to learn the 'baby' of the TV hit Big Valley and the amazing 'Million Dollar Man' was painfully uncomfortable and shy in public when he attended the premiere.

Stuntman A.J. Bakunas' (who also had a bit part in the film) 300' leap from the top of the building ended in his tragic death.  The stunt received live radio coverage.  Listening to the broadcast it was obvious before the actual announcement, based on the lack of definite immediate confirmation of his successful record winning stunt, that the outcome was dire for Bakunas (stunt double for Burt Reynolds in TV's Hooper).  The fall in the film as double for George Kennedy, has been previously completed from the 9th floor.  The jump from the top of the building was an attempt to regain a high fall record after he learned that Dar Robinson had broken his record high fall for a non-movie related publicity stunt. Bakunas, whose father was in attendance for what would be his final stunt, performed the fall expertly, but the airbag split on impact.  The film was dedicated to Bakunas.

I own 'Steel' on VHS and have just recently viewed once again.  For me, of course, the backdrop of my hometown is always interesting to see from the vantage point of the pinnacle of one of the tallest buildings in our city.  Additionally, I always enjoy seeing so many individuals I knew at that time making their celluloid debut particularly because so many of them are no longer with us.  These personal links to the film are not necessary though to enjoy the movie.

'Steel', while certainly not Oscar material or destined to be a classic, is instead a solid film with an impressive cast that pays homage to an art (hanging steel) and to the truly unique individuals who make that art their profession.  The writer did a fine job of presenting the personality traits and characteristics of so many of the fine men who daily walked the steel girders high above the rest of the world and the actors carried off their roles in a very believable fashion.  These men faced what so many of us fear and most had 'bigger than life', strong personas that made them an interesting breed to know and love.  It is the spirited characterizations along with the dazzling views from high atop the steel girders that infuses 'Steel' with the flavor that makes it something other than a run-of-the mill film.

Lee Majors did what I think was his best acting work in 'Steel'  Whether it was being back in his home state or settling back in with the blue collar citizenry of his childhood, he filled the steel-toed boots of an ironworker to a T.  Terry Kiser, an interesting versatile actor, was perfectly cast for the part of the lover in the crew and this was one of his best films.  Art Carney was truly enjoyable and George Kennedy, who had an important role but limited screen time, made his mark on the film.

This film seems to be becoming scarce, having never made it to DVD. Now that so many movie rental stores don't stock videos any longer, these old gems are becoming more difficult to catch-up on.  I would recommend 'Steel' to anyone with even a passing interest in building construction, working at heights, or mostly of course seeing an enjoyable movie with a believable plot populated by unique people one would enjoy getting to know.",1154908800,21,4373,4.710906701708279

8054192,4,B0007YUVWQ,"This pre-Hi-Fi 1984 VHS of STEEL is, as of 5/15, the only version available on home video.
Picture quality's not bad while audio is limited by a linear recording track.
.

A tragedy occurred on the shoot of STEEL (1979) when stuntman A.J. Bakunas tried to retake the
freefall record from Dar Robinson, who had topped A.J.'s nine story plummit previously shot for
this movie. Bakunis dove from the top of a skyscraper under construction and landed in airbags
that burst on impact. He was killed instantly. Footage of A.J.'s last fall is included in this movie.

To briefly summarize the plot, Lee Majors is an ex-roughneck who froze at the top of a site.
He quit the profession and became an OTR trucker. When old friend George Kennedy is killed
in an explosion and fall, the man's daughter (Jennifer O'Neill) convinces Majors to help complete
the project. They only have three weeks to assemble a special crew and build nine floors.

Majors' severe acrophobia doesn't bode well, as he says, ""a ramrod's scared of the top he ain't
worth nothin',"" but he and some old friends will give their all to finish the job in time. Ultimately
though there's the evil construction company rival (Yulin) who'll do anything to see them fail.

There's much product placement here.
In the first half hour alone we see three open cans of Miller beer, also a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coca-Cola/dp/B00HZYDW5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coca Cola</a>&nbsp;shot.
