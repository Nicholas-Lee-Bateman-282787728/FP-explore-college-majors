8578781,3,B00C8UW83C,The narrator could have been a little more enthused and not so seemingly monotone. The quality was good but I am not sold on this 4K technology until I can view some quality classic films. My family says they can see the difference over regular bluray.,1431648000,,252,4.5

8578783,1,B00C8UW83C,"This is the worst nature video I have ever seen.  The naration is what you would expect from a high school lecture.  The images are awful - awful orange and yellow, that is.  The filming is amatuerish, at best.  Although this is about animals, there are NO animal sounds!  What's up with that?  It all looks so fake.

If you want something on the order of Nature on PBS, or Planet Earth, this is eons away from them.",1431648000,3,416,4.256410256410256
8578784,4,B00C8UW83C,"I wanted to purchase 4K Blu-Ray content and this truly fit the bill...I use it as a demo to show off my new Samsung 4K's capabilities, and it's stunning to say the very least.",1431129600,,175,4.176470588235294
8578785,4,B00C8UW83C,"Received my copy today and thought the resolution was pretty good. This is a 1hr. documentary and the cameraman did a great job focusing on the animal rather than the surroundings. There is also a picture slideshow in the setup menu. The soundtrack is DTS-HD 5.1 audio. I played this on a Seiki 39"" 4K TV and a Samsung BD-F6700 which does 4K upscaling. I gave it 4 Stars because higher end 4K TV's may upscale this to a higher degree of resolution. I'll wait and read the upcoming reviews. Thanks!",1428624000,,497,4.472527472527473
