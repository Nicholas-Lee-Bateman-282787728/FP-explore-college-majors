728228,5,6303929583,"Pulsating under multiple layers of make-up, Ben Stiller's portrayel of camp owner Tony Perkis is one of the finest performences in cinematic history.  While critics will say this film hits you over the head with  mindless fat jokes and a mediocre message, the underlying reality is that  somehow Stiller overcame what, at one point, must have been an inane Disney  script.  This movie is a triumph mixing pre teen psychological angst,  satirical anarexic paranoia, sentimental summer hijinks, and subtle  detailed infomercial insanity.  From the ""blob"" to the black kid,  the underlying themes of society's acceptance and approval bubble through  the seemingly unilayered comedic glory. ""I rise, I rise, I rise""  sings the movie's spirit between the wonderfully chosen songs on its  soundtrack.  (Keep an eye out for who's REALLY playing ""Papa"" at  the end--wink wink).  This movie could not be improved.  Now that Kubrick  is gone we have one name to look to.  Bravo, Mr. Stiller (either one)  Bravo!",922838400,20,1001,5.182389937106918

728851,1,6303929583,"My eleven year old son liked the movie. 'Blech' is the best descriptive word that I could find for this. It makes sense to state up front that I'm not a huge fan of Ben Stiller and this movie didn't change that fact.

Ben portrays a thinly-veiled Tony Robbins-type motivational guy who misapplies his adult coaching approach to heavy kids, for the self-serving purpose of creating an infomercial for a weight loss camp program. Even that description sounds lame and the movie doesn't make it any better. It;s full of the typical moments these types of film have: a geek counselor falls for the pretty girl (in this case, the camp nurse), the tables are turned on the 'bad' counselors by the kids, and the kids gain self-confidence to win against a rival camp.

The positives are that Stiller's parents, Anne Meara and Jerry Stiller, made a cameo appearance as the former owners of the camp. And Ben is in enviable physical shape which is shown throughout the film. Good for him! And that was about it on the plus side for me.

I guess that some of the other positive reviews (of which there are many) come from the fact that people first viewed this as a child and have a fond memory for it. I kind of feel that way about Meatballs, a camp movie that except for the weight focus, shares a number of the typical moments mentioned previously. And even that only rates a three star review.

I don't think I have ever before said this about a Disney film, but avoid this one.",1478908800,,1471,4.477611940298507

728855,5,6303929583,"I adored this movie as a kid, and it stood up over time. I love the young actors. I love the playfulness of it. I love the adult characters having the kids' backs. I love that the kids never do lose weight, and that that's okay! I love how the young characters love and support themselves and each other, without it being preachy or sappy. This is the sort of movie I watch and rewatch when I'm in a bad mood and need something funny and happy to cheer me up. I even loved how the ""victory"" at the end was realistic (well, within the terms of the movie itself) - the kids didn't magically turn into star athletes, but the contest was won on terms that had them on equal footing. (And it gave the young character who'd previously seemed fairly useless a chance to shine during the academic part of the competition.)

Basically it was a movie about fat kids that treated its characters with respect and invited the viewer to laugh with them, not at them. And from 1995, long before ""fat acceptance"" was a thing! It was hilarious, but as a kid it was also powerful and important for me, and it's just as good now as it was then.",1477180800,5,1125,4.257009345794392

I believe it was such a rich experience because we could relate to each segment of the story, each character, and each plot twist throughout the film.

730098,5,6303929583,"This was one of my favorite movies growing up and it's still one of my favorite movies as an adult. Luckily, my wife loves it too, so we watch it quite frequently - just last night in fact. It barely beats out Mighty Ducks as my favorite Disney movie and is probably in my top 5 favorite films ever. The things that were funny as a kid are just as funny now. Definitely one of Ben Stiller's finer performances, if not his best ever. Kenan Thompson also delivers one of his finer performances. This movie is absolutely hilarious. Why the fantasyland speedway ride in Disneyworld wasn't named the Camp Hope go carts, or something like that is completely beyond me - someone really dropped the ball there. I can't wait until my kids are old enough to watch this and appreciate the hilarity. Despite being about a bunch of fat kids at fat camp, there are not that many jokes disparagingly aimed at the weight of the kids, which is nice. The main laughs come from Stiller's eccentric character. Many of his awesome quotes have entered my standard lexicon, such as: ""Come here you devil log!,"" ""Lunch has been cancelled due to lack of hustle. Deal with it.,"" I EAT success for breakfast! With skim milk."" Oh man, comedy gold. If you're a sane person who ended up reading reviews on a movie with a cover showing four fat kids holding a dude in a giant sandwich above their heads, you'll most likely love this movie.",1454025600,7,1408,4.50390625

Ben Stiller steals the show in the villain role, and Judd Apatow's writing is definetely more adult than your average Disney movie. The movie looks great on my 720p TV and the special features are some of the best I've ever seen on a blu ray. Along with the 30 or so deleted scenes there is a ""where are they now"" vignette that features Gerry and several of the other campers.

It's a little different as far as comedy style for a Disney movie, and they pushed the boundaries with a lot of the deleted scenes. It's made more for an older audience than kids, even though on the surface, it's a kids movie. There are a lot of references to popular films that only older viewers will get.

Camp Something or another, and the kids and the parents, the councilors and all that ensues. This is like that but it delivers with family friendly laughs and heart felt emotions. I think this is a great movie for families or anyone who likes comedies in general.

Regardless, I popped some popcorn and popped in the dvd. I laughed and laughed. Quick plot summary: Ben Stiller plays a lonely fat kid who only wants to eat. He goes to a prison camp and they don't let him eat. Then he loses weight and is finally happy. All of the kids lose their weight and prove that you can be happy as long as your skinny. It's a feel-good story.

Unfortunately, my wife has since left me due to my weight issues. But whenever I get lonely I put on Heavyweights and my problems just fade away.

He harbors a hatred for fat people and is trying to force the kids to lose weight through humiliation and torture and only wants them to lose weight for his own personal gain.

 The kids then rebel and start binge eating after imprisoning Tony. However Pat, a camp counselor, then teaches the kids they need to start being responsible and not only starts making the camp fun, but makes weight loss fun for the kids.

When Pat takes over after Tony is defeated, the kids are able to defeat the rival camp, Camp MVP. While MVP dominated the obstacle course, they slow down when it came to the mental challenges such as saving balloons and answering tough questions allowing Camp Hope to catch up and use their skills and intelligences to ultimately win, proving that while weight loss is important, fitness isn't everything. Overall, this is a great family movie and I would strongly recommend it.",1396483200,3,1055,4.601063829787234

I bought it thinking I would be the only 20-ish year old in the neighborhood who had heard of it but it turned out that so many people know and love this movie. That evolved into my annual Happy Heavyweights Night. Every year I hold a party at my house where you bring a subway sandwich, wear a yellow shirt and watch this movie. Right when the campers flip out and have their amazing food party is when I break out all of the fixings for amazing sundaes.

Fellow Amazoners, I encourage you to do the same. Pick a nice spring night when you're thinking about how great it would be to jump off the blob in real life and then host a party with this amazing movie.",1388016000,2,909,3.9347826086956523

732157,3,6303929583,"Released in 1995, ""Heavyweights"" is a Disney comedy about kids who have been sent to ""Camp Hope,"" AKA:  fat camp.  Many of the return campers remember their summers at ""Camp Hope"" fondly, but this year a new counselor named Tony Perkis has taken over.  Tony imposes strict fitness and diet regimens that lead to a campers' revolt.

The movie, co-written by Judd Apatow and directed/co-written by Steven Brill, was poorly received by critics at the time of its release (29% on Rotten Tomatoes).  Like many comedies, the film does find a loving fan-base and is considered a comedy-cult-classic.  ""Heavyweights"" uses light-hearted humor that is especially enjoyable for young viewers; I've always found the movie to be one that's funnier when watched with friends than when watched alone.  While it was not one of my favorites growing up, I have added it to my collection for nostalgic purposes.  Cast-members include:  Ben Stiller as both Tony Perkis, Jr. and Tony Perkis, Sr., Jerry Stiller as Harvey Bushkin, Aaron Schwartz as Gerald Garner, Anne Meara as Alice Bushkin, Tom McGowan as Pat Finley, Tim Blake Nelson as Roger Johnson, Kenan Thompson as Roy, Judd Apatow as Homer, Tom Hodges as Lars, Allen Covert as Kenny, Cody Burger as Cody, Jeffrey Tambor as Maury Garner, Shaun Weiss as Josh Birnbaum, Leah Lail as Julie, Paul Feig as Tim, and Lauren Michelle Hill as ""Angelic Girl.""

SUMMARY:  Gerry is initially nervous about his first summer at fat camp.  Once he settles in at Chipmunk Cabin, he makes friends among the veteran campers who lend reassurance that this will be a fun summer.  For further comfort, the returning campers reveal their treasure troves of junk food--much to Gerry's delight.

The boys are devastated to learn that Camp Hope has undergone a change of ownership and will now be the `poster child' for Tony Perkis' fitness informercial.  Tony orders for the cabins to be raided and emptied of any banned foods, inciting a campers' rebellion.  As the battle pranks unfold, the boys are successful in dodging weight loss--further adding to Tony's anger.  The back-and-forth struggle between Tony and the campers climaxes when the kids' parents learn of what has been happening at the camp.",1382918400,,2216,4.994550408719346

This was one of my favorite movies as a kid, and it's still hilarious as an adult.  There are lots of lines in this film that they couldn't get away with in today's PC world, but were and still are incredible.  Ben Stiller is so much better as a fitness junky in 'Heavyweights' than he is in ""Dodgeball"". Seriously underrated and underappreciated movie.",1381795200,,420,4.5

(Or, in some very rare cases, the person HAS seen Heavyweights, meaning, of course, that they love it; and then that person finds him- or herself a little bit closer to my heart.)  The next step, obviously, is for me to organize a beer-and-pizza Heavyweights viewing party, so that I can introduce this new friend and any other poor souls who have not seen the movie to the glory that is HEAVYWEIGHTS.

I would have liked to have seen Ben Stiller though in the special features.  If you like this movie you will not be disappointed.

During the 90s, a lot of great kids films were made which means there were a lot of child actors/stars at the time. You will see several in this film. One thing I loved about the blu-ray is the current interviews. They have tracked down several of the films stars and you get to hear what it was like, during filming, from their perspective. One star even had a birthday during filming - No Spoilers here though.
The film itself follows Jerry and his new friends to Camp Hope (a camp for overweight kids) which is terrorized by the new owner, an insane Tony Perkins, who is trying to get rich quick. Ben Stiller's performance is just incredible. I have never seen him in anything like this since and it remains some of his best work. His parents are also in the film, playing the original owners of Camp Hope.

But the worst thing about it is that there were NO special features whatsoever!

BUT NOW the definitive Heavyweights experience is here! Its in glorious HD, its original widescreen aspect ratio and comes LOADED with special features!
There is a feature that focuses on what the kids look like now and their experiences with the film, a full behind the scenes featurette, commentary with Judd Apatow and cast, plus tons of deleted and extended scenes!

732944,4,6303929583,"""Heavyweights,"" a small, low-budget adolescent comedy about ugly ducklings, may have emerged over time as a little swan. Not a classic by any stretch, but a solid, entertaining romp with little fat (sorry!)

The creative team behind ""Heavyweights"" has gone from a small fraternity of struggling actors and filmmakers to some of today's movers and shakers, including Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"") and Paul Feig (""Bridemaids"").

Listening to the brand-new Audio Commentary is akin to visiting their school reunion, in which the once young, tireless and hungry rebels are now middle-aged, successful, but a little disillusioned. It's also interesting to hear how the pecking order of the past snaps back when they get back together, just from the way they all talk -- or don't talk as much -- on the commentary track.

Like Gene Wilder's ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and Walt Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland,"" 'Heavyweights"" was considered too dark and sardonic on its first release, but gained a loyal following over the years.

This was only Ben Stiller's second feature film. At the time, he had come off ""The Ben Stiller Show"" and accepted the role of psychotic Tony Perkis (a twist on ""Perkins?""). He literally threw himself completely into the role, but according to the director, was disappointed when an audience of kids didn't find him funny, just mean. His image was not on tthe VHS or DVD release covers. Apparently he has reconciled his feeling about it -- he is prominently featured on this new Blu-ray package

17 years later, with the tone of kid's cartoons like ""Spongebob"" and ""Phineas and Ferb"" presenting adversaries even nuttier than Perkis, the film seems to better fit the mood of today's times.

Often teetering beyond its PG rating, ""Heavyweights"" may still strike some as very strange indeed, being sort of a comical ""Lord of the Flies"" where all the boys are like ""Piggy."" It has deliberate nods to ""Gone with the Wind,"" ""Apocalypse Now"" ""Platoon"" But so does ""Spongebob"" cartoons, just as Bugs Bunny classics contained references lost on kids but still funny to them. My son, who had never seen the movie before, finds it imminently quotable (""I am Lars!"" ""I come from far away!"" ""Repulse the monkey!"")

Some parents may not be so enchanted, though. Foreshadowing their later, more raunchy movies, Apatow and company tread very close to the edge of bad taste and inappropriate material for young children, and Disney films in general (depending on your point of view, they fall off the edge at times, even in ""Heavyweights"" -- particularly in the alternate scenes).

But the filmmakers are not historically accurate in their comments that they were bringing an ""edge"" to Disney films. Lots of Walt's films had more ""edge"" than they sometimes get credit for. And even some basic humor. Pop in a ""Fantasia"" disc and you'll even see one or two tushies.",1355875200,,2891,4.995841995841996
732945,4,6303929583,"For a few filmmakers, before they achieve popularity they have to start somewhere.  And for Judd Apatow (""Knocked Up"", ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", ""Pineapple Express""), the writer/producer started with television with TV movies for Tom Arnold and ""The Ben Stiller Show"", but for his first feature film as a writer, it was the 1995 teen comedy ""Heavyweights"".

While the film didn't do well in the box office, the film received a cult following, especially since it featured the earlier work of director Steven Brill (""Little Nicky"", ""Without a Paddle"", ""Drillbit Taylor"") and actors Ben Stiller (""Tropic Thunder"", ""Zoolander"", ""Starsky & Hutch""), Kenan Thompson (""Saturday Night Live"", ""Fat Albert"", ""Kenan & Kel""), Aaron Schwartz (""Gossip Girl"", ""The Mighty Ducks"", ""Stray""), Leah Lail (""V.I.P."", ""Little Nicky"") and Shaun Weiss (""Drillbit Taylor"", ""The Mighty Ducks"" films).  The film would also star Jeffrey Tambor (""There's Something About Mary"", ""The Hangover"", ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas""), Jerry Stiller (""The King of Queens"", ""Seinfeld""), Anne Meara (""Awakenings"", ""Night at the Museum"", ""Fame"") and Tom McGowan (""Ghost World"", ""Bad Santa"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"").

VIDEO:

""Heavyweights"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Surprisingly, I was expecting this '90s film to look a bit soft. But it actually looks quite good for its age.  Shot outdoors, the film looks bright and colorful, skin tones look natural and the film looks good overall.  Granted, the film still looks like a film from the '90s but no doubt looks amazing on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Heavyweights"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is pretty much dialogue and music-driven.  Both are crystal clear and while I personally didn't notice much surround sound use during my viewing of the film, aside from ambiance, for a film like ""Heavyweights"", the lossless soundtrack is quite appropriate.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Heavyweights"" comes with the following special features:

JUDGMENT CALL:

What a surprise?

Judd Apatow and Steven Brill's ""Heavyweights"" on Blu-ray and in the words of Kenan Thompson, ""People want to see us...'Heavyweights' in HD?""

As a fan of Kenan Thompson especially his earlier work, it's great to see him and some of the cast of ""The Mighty Ducks"" on ""Heavyweights"".  It's definitely not politically correct and a film about overweight kids going to a weightloss camp, yet gaining weight while in camp (and licking chocolate and sweets from each other's body) would probably make people think ""WTF!"".

But this was released during the mid-90s, a time when ""Beavis & Butthead"" were on television and sensitivity towards certain issues were not a primary focus in a family film.

But as the cast will tell you on the special features, ""Heavyweights"" was funny and fascinating because the children in the film are overweight and the fact is that even when they weren't filming, they were being fed with pizza and all you can eat ribs for $5.  You probably will never see a film like this ever being made these days, so for comedy fans, ""Heavyweights"" is hilarious but also, so wrong...you feel a bit guilty for laughing.

But first, for Judd Apatow film fans, ""Heavyweights"" is an interesting release because it is one film you just never pictured being released on Blu-ray.  But you get to see cast members when they were younger, overweight and sporting the poofy hair.

While the film's humor is because the film exploits these overweight kids who feel nothing is wrong with them, the film does showcase them as the underdogs.  Almost in ""Revenge of the Nerds"" kind of way, these kids who are always the loser when it comes to competing with their rival camp mates, they are always made fun of because of their weight.  So, with teamwork and good thinking, these kids many not win a race or a competition of endurance but they could utilize other talents for their camp competition.

What's interesting is the featurette ""Where Are They Now?"" and to see how many of these kids grew up to be thin adults.  Aaron Schwartz appeared on ""Gossip Girl"" and he is fit, Shaun Weiss is also quite thin, it was interesting to see the various talent comment about themselves in the past and just to see how different they look in 2012.

But I enjoyed the film for it's humor and for a '90s film, it was a lot of fun to watch this film once again nearly 17 years later.  For those that are sensitive of overweight jokes, this film is probably not for you.  But these kids know they are overweight, they know that the public sees them as overweight but part of the concept of ""Heavyweights"" is that Camp Hope represents a place where these kids can be together and not be teased for their weight.  And take part in activities without worry if they are swimming without a t-shirt on or just being among their peers and feel respected and getting support.

While this film is considered a Disney family film, it's important for parents to know that this is rated PG and there are some rude dialogue that you probably don't want your children to hear.  Even my wife was a little unnerved to hear some of the dialogue and questioned me (since I was watching with my 9-year-old) repeatedly if this film was appropriate for him to watch.

As for the Blu-ray release, I was expecting this mid-90s film to look a little soft but for the most part, colors are good.  Skin tones are natural and I didn't see any problems such as banding or artifacts, ""Heavyweights"" looks and sounds good on Blu-ray!  But the special features were really awesome and I don't think I have seen so many deleted scenes included with a film before.  So, you kind of realize that there were a lot of experimentation of scenes to see what would work and what wouldn't for the final cut of the film.

For fans of Judd Apatow or Steven Brill films, it's important to remember that this is their earlier work.  As well as for a lot of these younger talent featured in the film.  But for those who grew up during this time and watched this movie in the theater or on cable, will probably enjoy the crazy humor of ""Heavyweights"".  Sure, the jokes are immature and juvenile, but it's an Apatow/Brill film.

Overall, ""Heavyweights"" is a PG popcorn comedy film that will entertain families and for those who grew up with this film.  It's not for everyone and some people may find the film insulting to people who are overweight.  But if you are sensitive to jokes about those who are overweight, then this film is not for you.  But for those with an open mind to Apatow comedies, including this earlier film will find it to be entertaining and fun.  Plus, with a Blu-ray release that looks and sounds good and with so much additional content included, fans of ""Heavyweights"" will definitely want to check this Blu-ray out!",1355788800,,7819,4.882397572078907

Also, the experience of seeing it up close made me anti-Ben Stiller for many years to follow.  Here is why:  This film started production the week following REALITY BITES being the number one movie.  Stiller directed REALITY, which became a run away hit film for himself, Ethan Hawke and Wynona Rider.  I guess the success (his first major film success after moving from TV) went to his head quickly.  He seemed annoyed to have to fulfill a previously signed contract to do this movie and he comported himself in a very unprofessional and obnoxious manner the entire time.  In one scene we shot, in particular, he would mock and make fun of the films director in front of the cast and crew, he would refuse to take direction, and would make negative comments about the film, the script, the others involved, etc.  You could tell that he thought that he was far ""better"" than everyone there and the product itself.  Seeing this, turned me off on Stiller big time, and I boycotted his movies for years to come because of it. Rather than being happy and gracious with his newfound success, he was obnoxious and arrogant. The crew and much of the cast detested him and loathed working with him.  The director was simply stuck trying to make the best of it.  It was the most unprofessional behavior I have ever witnessed in all of the film productions I have been a part of (By contrast, I worked with James Garner, Jack Lemmon and Dan Ackroyd a year later and they were both great, gracious and professional, putting Stiller's antics in a proper perspective.)
The kids and supporting cast working on the movie were all happy to be there, and very enjoyable to be around.
What could have been a great experience was tainted. I tried to give the movie a fair shake upon seeing it at the premiere, but it just felt like it fell short.  It lacked something. They were clearly wanting to try and capitalize on some of the MIGHTY DUCKS success with this film, but it lacked the same substance and heart. ANd I honestly think that it was because of the on-set attitudes of the star that helped prevent this from being a better film.
Just my two cents from some first hand experience.",1354320000,2,2326,4.5250596658711215

733132,5,6303929583,"Heavyweights is a great fun comedy for everyone of all ages. The characters are so much fun, daring, hilarious, and sometimes even serious. I love when camp MVP comes over to 'Camp Hope' to try and show off how better they are. Thats when the fun really starts...The kids make smart remarks at camp MVP, and everything they say, and do, is hilarious! One of Jerry's new friends is Josh. He is one of the jokesters that makes this movie worthwhile. Josh'll throw out a lot of jokes here and there, and right from the beginning...you automatically know that he is going to either get in trouble, or throw out a serious joke! When the new owner of 'Camp Hope' is introduced, he takes away all of the candy, sweets, anything fattening so that the kids can lose weight. Now, the kids are furious at all of their candies 'secret hiding places' are. They have nothing left to eat when they're tired of healthy food! A few of Jerry's friends, and him, go into the the new owner's house to look for any kind of sweets there. They don't find any candy, but...they find something, very disturbing. Jerry had written a letter to his grandma about everything going on. The go-karts were destroyed, the blob was punctured, the food was horrible, and his parents wouldn't listen to him. Well, the kids found a locked trunk, hoping that maybe some sweet candy would be in there. Instead, there were all the letters that the kids letters to be sent home to their loved ones! All of the kids think that he's 'sick', and Jerry finds his letter from his grandma! Now, the kids left immediately because the owner was coming! They relax at the restrooms, and Jerry hears 'food' wrapper. Philip yells to go away, and they open the door to find him eating a sandwich! The group of kids demand to know where Philip got the food at and he says 'Okay but you guys got to keep it a secret, okay.' Late at night, kids one by one, go out and grab themselves a piece of food. Even Pat decides to get in on the action along with the kids! This movies is so wonderful, every time that I re-watch it, I laugh over and over again. It makes me feel like when I was five, watching it for the first time.

Ben Stiller before he was a big star.  And, it's a Judd Apatow movie for kids.  Can't get any better to me.  The movie centers on Gerry Garner, a chubby kid from Long Island with a mean dad, who himself in retrospect can't get away from work, or his own personal stuff to spend time with his overweight son.  The other kids, namely Keenan Thompson, and Goldberg from Mighty Ducks all shine, full of one liners and great physical comedy.  There are some seriously funny can't miss sequences here, some involving a strenuous hike, a hilarious food discovery, weigh in/photo session montage, and quite a few others.  The line I can't ever forget in this movie is  ""You've Broken My Camera!"". When you see it, you'll know why I laugh.  Seriously. All things aside, I think this movie is excellent for the 8 and up crowd, and at 22, I still find myself cracking up at it.

733354,4,6303929583,"I remember enjoying HEAVYWEIGHTS growing up, and I quoted it a lot, which is strange, because I never really watched it past the adolescent point. Just today I viewed it again as a sophomore in college, and I've come to a strange conclusion: this movie is simultaneously a dumb kids movie and a... well, dumb, but very funny, comedy. This is largely due to Ben Stiller's over-the-top performance as Tony Perkis, aka the prequel to his White Goodman character in DODGEBALL, as well as Tom Hodges as Lars (which I'm pretty sure is the role he's known for, considering... well, who the hell is Tom Hodges? No offense, Tom), one of Tony's muscle-bound idiots who is from... far away. The kids have their funny parts, but they mostly account for the farting, eating, and farting while eating jokes.
 Anyway, the story concerns overweight 11-year-old Gerry Garner, whose parents send him to Camp Hope, a summer camp for overweight kids. He starts to feel comfortable there because everyone else likes to stuff their faces with sugar just as much as him. Then the sh- sorry, Disney movie- poopie hits the fan, as the sweet old couple (Stiller's parents, Anne Meara and Jerry Stiller) who own the camp are replaced by Perkis, a self-help exercise guru determined to turn these fatties into brawny Schwarzeneggers by the end of summer, all of which will be filmed for an infomercial to aid Perkis' career. The first half of the movie is the kids facing Perkis' strictness, while the second half is them rebelling. Along the way, there's a tepid romance between Pat (Tom McGowan), the former-camper-turned-sweet-counselor, and Julie (Leah Lail), the sweet camp nurse, and some added wackiness from Paul 'creator of FREAKS & GEEKS' Feig as Tim, the skinny counselor who used to be a fat camper.
 There is a lot of talent involved here: Stiller, Feig, and most notably Judd Apatow, who co-wrote and executive produced, and who of course would also do the same for FREAKS, thus establishing his burgeoning career as of late (and Seth Rogen and James Franco's, I'm sure). Then there's director Steven Brill, who also did THE MIGHTY DUCKS, a few Adam Sandler films (LITTLE NICKY, MR. DEEDS), and Apatow and Rogen's DRILLBIT TAYLOR. So it's obvious where the laughs came from. The rest is a typical, clichd kids movie, but once you see Stiller walk defiantly on broken glass to prove his inner and outer strength, none of that will matter, dear campers.",1220227200,,2437,4.841726618705036

733440,5,6303929583,"The best thing I can say about Heavyweights is that it probably wouldn't be made today.  It pulls no punches, pokes fun at all the most questionable places, and avoids political correctness.

Heavyweights is the story of a bunch of fat kids at a fat kid summer camp.  They all attend because their parents want them to lose weight, and on its surface, that's what the camp is about.  However, the camp owners actually have a great place, with all sorts of games, activities, and even go-karts.  Unfortunately for the piglets, the camp is under new management.

The new owner Tony Perkins (Ben Stiller) has a grandiose idea to ""help"" these kids lose weight, and run a successful camp.  His ulterior motive, however, is to use film footage of his camp experience and make an infomercial from which he plans to make millions.  His methodology at the camp: exercise torture.

In a matter of no time, the camp is in chaos, all the kids are terrified, and Tony Perkins has instituted policies that make camp life a living hell.  There's a ton of exercise, psychological warfare, and basic training-level discipline.  This is where the hilarity ensues.

A collection of comedy follows, in what could easily be seen as the tgrue beginning to Ben Stiller's career.  Jabs at both the lazy habits and self-defeating nature of the obese, as well as those who loathe them, keep the laughs coming.  I particularly loved the scene in which the kids are all at the lake, basically tied to one another, yelling ""Buuudddyyyyy!"" to prove they were watching one another - a hilariously great idea for the lazy personnel manager.

Will the kids lose weight?  Will they survive?  Will Perkins keep the camp and make huge money with his infomercial?  Who cares...it's hilarious, just sit back and enjoy the fat jokes.",1202515200,,1794,4.7882736156351795

Ben Stiller's character, a cross between Zoolander and Dodgeball (both being AMAZING movies), was unexpectedly plain and bland.

733575,5,6303929583,"12 year old Gerry Garner joins a group of ""heavy"" kids that are sent to their favorite fat camp for the summer, ""Camp Hope"" (a place where they're supposed to lose weight, but instead have a fun time). The kids find out that the camp has been sold to a crazy fitness instructor named Tony Perkins (Ben Stiller), so now, the camp has turned into a living hell for the kids. No more candy, or fun things like Go Karts and ""The Blob"". Tony wants the kids to lose weight, so he'll be able to make a profit from his fitness TV commercials (he has a camera man follow him around the camp). However, the kids rebel against Tony, because they want to have fun, not exercise, therefore, Tony starts to go crazy (in a hilarious way), so he decides to counter their actions, for example: one day, he takes their lunch away, and on another day, takes them on a 20 mile hike, among other things. Gerry and his new friends, along with the original camp staff members Pat, who has visited the camp every summer for the past 18 years, and a goofy counselor named Tim who became fit before the summer, as well as a new nurse named Julie, decide to take the camp back.

Ben Stiller is HILARIOUS in this movie. Seeing him as an insane health nut, patting kids down, searching for a pez dispenser or watching his character getting mad at the kids is great. While the film is not a cinema masterpiece, Stiller's performance in this film is great, and he delivers some of the funniest lines I've heard in a movie. His character in this film is like a younger version of White Goodman in ""Dodgeball"". Is this a guilty pleasure? Definitely.

733674,4,6303929583,"Granted this film has a few plot holes (how did Tony Perkis change clothes so fast on the twenty mile hike) and it was originally geared towards children. Nevertheless, HEAVYWEIGHTS is one of the better movies made about summer camps.

HEAVYWEIGHTS revolves around a youth named Gerry. Gerry is a bit overweight and the opening shots of the film illustrate how this causes Gerry problems. His parents decide that Gerry needs some excitement in his life and send him away to a fat camp. At first Gerry isn't too thrilled by the idea. But then he figures out that it's not bad at all because at camp, his weight isn't an issue because all the kids there are overweight like he is. The conflict in the film begins when the campers and staff learn that the elderly couple, who have been running the camp for so long, have been forced to sell the camp. The camp's new owner, Tony Perkis (Ben Stiller) is a fitness guru who wants to use the camp to make a fortune filming the odyssey of this camp full of heavyweights who are turned into muscle machines by the end of summer.

HEAVYWEIGHTS is really a good movie that's a lot of fun to watch. It's got a solid message about respecting yourself for who you are, yet the delivery isn't so over the top that it's smaltzy. There are a lot of wonderful one-liners throughout the movie that are great for quoting throughout life. The acting is superb, especially since most of the actors are overweight adolescents. Ben Stiller is hilarious playing Tony Perkis (he recently reincarnated his Tony Perkis character in the raunchy, adult summer garbage-fest DODGEBALL) and this was one of Stiller's earlier breaks in his career.

Overall, HEAVYWEIGHTS is a great camp movie that has a little bit of something that everyone should be able to appreciate and enjoy. Now, repulse the monkey.",1092268800,,1822,4.669781931464175

Tony is like one of those health buffs that do weird exercises and have weird techniques and such, all of which are highly ineffective. All of this drives the kids to sneaking candy and cheating, which is what they always do at camp, but this time, they'er desperate.
The co-stars in the movie are awesome, there's Lars, the strange foriegn counselor with a hilarious accent and funny sleeping problem, there's Kenny the camera-man, who may look familiar to you if you've seen plenty of Adam Sandler movies,  Roy and Josh, comedic camp legends, and of course, Gerry, the main fat kid in the movie.

It's about a camp for overweight kids that gets taken over by a psycho fitness infomercial guy named Tony Perkins(Ben Stiller).

On the way up he says, ""Did you ever hear the story of Icarus? He continually rolled the ball up the hill. But when he got too close, the ball melted in the heat of the sun. You're all like Icarus!"" Soonafter he ends up ordering the campers to do crazy zen stuff like 'feel the chi', 'Repulse the monkey', and 'part the wild horses mane'.

You will learn valuable lessons like regardless of whether or not it will ""smush"" always have crazy guys locked up in cages through over hershey's kisses making your queen proud, and that lunch can be cancelled due to lack of hustle.

733839,5,6303929583,"Ok, this is THE FUNNIEST movie besides Jungle 2 Jungle, I LOVE it, I watch it EVERY time it's on TV.  Like most of the other movies I reviewed, the plot is kind of dumb but it's HiLaRiOuS so that's OK.  I Highly recommend it as a funny movie to watch, especially in the summer.",1002067200,,277,4.0181818181818185

The movie also has a message about self esteem. I recommend everyone young and old to watch this fantastic flick!!",995241600,,272,4.313725490196078
733841,5,6303929583,"This movie is so funny! I love it. It's about a boy (everyone calls him captain) whos parents send him to a fat camp. When he gets there, he realizes that all the other kids come every year because its fun and they sneak food and don't loose a pound. But when the owners go indebt, the sell it to Tony Perkiss, who plans to turn the summer into an infomercial on kid's loosing weight. He makes the kids to grueling stuff like eat less and exercise alot. It gets really funny when the kids revolt against him. You'll love it! Buy it today!",985392000,,538,4.1826923076923075
