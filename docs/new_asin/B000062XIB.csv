This film stars all of the vemons except Lo meng aka Iron arms, the story line is good but most of all the final fight segment is dynomite alone, this film you will watch over and over again.",1204848000,2,301,4.392857142857143

2752318,4,B000062XIB,"Slow moving story, but the martial arts action is great. Once you get finished with the first 20 said minutes its all none stop action mostly. Great to watch if you wanna see unique martial action. All the martial arts are done with a unique twist than other Mr. Chu's films.",1484179200,,275,4.411764705882353

2752324,4,B000062XIB,"The fight scenes were great!  However, the story plot was unbalanced and too long to consume.  Whenever you merge the cast members of the ""5 Deadly Venoms"" together then the battle is off the chart.",1480636800,,198,4.628571428571429
8173626,5,B000062XIB,The acrobatics of the actors are phenomenal and the choreography is amazing.  Really enjoyed this one from the shaw brothers.,1526947200,,125,5.25
8173627,4,B000062XIB,"Are we sure this is the right title for this movie? Because amazon is selling a DVD with the same name, which has a different cast and plot, and a sword named ""stained with royal blood"".

This movie has a sword, but its the golden snake's sword and isn't central to the story. So.... What's up?

Beyond that, this is a multi-generational hodgepodge of a few different familiar kung fu movie tropes, with some good-to- great kung fu from some of the venom crew, and at least at amazon streaming some very weird English subtitles. Disjointed, bad grammar, and awkward.  However, it manages to add to the disorienting charm of the lead's innocent but kick-a$$ journey.

No idea why he'd tolerate the terrible kung fu Veruca Salt he becomes sworn brothers with.",1517702400,,757,4.712121212121212

8173631,5,B000062XIB,Watch lots of martial arts and I really like this one.  Love the integrity of the hero and the semi-story line of betrayal and family history.  I enjoyed it.,1490572800,,157,4.379310344827586
8173632,5,B000062XIB,Love this ridiculously cheesy movie.,1489708800,,36,6.4
8173633,4,B000062XIB,"Movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles. It's about a kid who learns kung-fu since childhood from one master to discover a new kung-fu hidden away in a cave.  However, the new kung-fu was buried in a box near an old skeleton along with a treasure map that leads to loads of gold.  To get to this box, one must not be greedy and only has the interest of doing good.  Those who are greedy will be killed in this cave.  This kid, however, is a good kid and does the right thing by following all the instruction as left behind by the person who is now a skeleton.  In doing so, the kid learns a new powerful kung-fu in swordsmanship and the instruction requires that he must give the treasure map to a special woman whose family is wealthy and powerful (bad guys, as they stole money from another martial arts school that was meant to help the poor).  Later in the film you learn that the skeleton belongs to the lover that the woman of the house were planning to elope with. However, the father never approved of this relationship, so he was chasing down the lover in the past not knowing that the lover had died rich in a cave.  The woman has a daughter who then falls in love with this kid, whom the father, now a grandfather, also does not approve.  So, he tries to kill the kid as well, but the kid with his two kung-fu's is quite a challenge.",1489622400,,1348,4.23828125
