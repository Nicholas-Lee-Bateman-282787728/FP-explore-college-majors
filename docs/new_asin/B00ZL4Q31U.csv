8720492,1,B00ZL4Q31U,"11 Blocks aims a little too high and winds up falling on it's face. A standard fight-your-way-free plot is bogged down by some complications in the plot and use of staggered sequencing, neither of which plays out very well. Low production values and poor acting are the final nails in the coffin here. Pretty unwatchable overall.",1453420800,,329,4.892857142857143
8720493,1,B00ZL4Q31U,Fight scenes were alright but there is NO COMPARRISON to The Warriors. Not good.,1444176000,,80,4.785714285714286
8720494,4,B00ZL4Q31U,"Every generation gets its own version of The Warriors, a 1979 movie where a protagonist alone (or in TW with his homies) must travel through areas controlled by rival gangs.  11 Blocks is such a one for a dystopian 2015.

11 B uses a plot of getting from point A to B, but the conflict is actually made fresh and entertaining by precisely placed flashbacks. ( It's not the fights as much the editing that prompts my rating it  4*.)

The protagonist makes this journey to save his sister. Apart from the fighting, which is always the first appeal of this sort of movie, we are given those flashbacks which clarify the protagonist's life as filled with cruel training which leads to a death that keeps the protagonist in torment.

Anyhow, in 11B we watch our hero face several dozen bad guys.  While massed as four or maybe five distinct gangs, just about every opponent is met one on one.

These matches are not presented in a dazzlingly choreographed way (anything with Jet or Jackie or Won) or in  extended violence (Korea's--Old Boy) we now expect as a norm.  However the fights in 11 B are workmanlike, realistic, and worth a view.

Two other elements are significant.  There are a couple or three tidy demonstrations of parkour.  And there is a final confrontation with an especially well skilled antagonist that is impressive.

Brutal instruction and personal grit help to overcome the last opponent--a master who has the hero's strength, skill, endurance and  knowledge asian pressure points which he attempts to put to deadly use.

Those who like all that I praised above might choose to not read what follows since I will be throwing shade.

I could point to flaws aplenty in 11 B.  But I'll  vent only about two.

I really object to the Occupy Wall Street movement being cited as a cause for the dystopian world envisioned in 11 Blocks.  (I like those OWS  folks; so I take ill their catching flak.)

And second, the soundtrack is awful: it is a techno or beat box something lacking any relation to the action on screen.  Early in 11 B we see our hero getting his cookies pounded to music that might go well with watching spit evaporate or a cricket die.

Good viewing.  Certainly worth watching with buds. If your gf  watches this with you and says she enjoyed it, she is lying but she really likes you.",1443139200,2,2313,4.594132029339853
