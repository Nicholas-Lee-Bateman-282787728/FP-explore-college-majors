The story is of this long ago failed attempt to rock the art boat a bit is more than of art historical interest , I have come to see the Relist View in retrospect as having had  a far stronerg impact on that art world than it's current obscurity might suggest. The work of these artists has influenced and inspired many new, young artists who were just beginning their painting careers in the 1980's people like Jacob Collins, Tony Curanjic, Ed Minnow, Tom Wharton, Dan Sprick, Sharon Sprung, Ellen Eagle, Katya O'Hagan  who are only a small number of an incredibly long list that  represents a new wave of Realism that is now beginning to be officially noticed. .There are only three of us left of this naively optimistic group  and the narrative  spelled out in this nice documentary is  still a compelling one.",1478304000,2,1103,5.574850299401198

The video shows a lot of the art these people produced and the diversity and contrasts are engaging. Personal interviews and anecdotal narratives make this a very human examination of the ""failed"" exhibition ( only 2 reviews)  but raises the interesting idea that perhaps it did not fail after all  considering the rise of representational realist painting in the first decade of the new century. At the price it's a steal!",1388188800,,835,6.380530973451328
8478746,5,B005LXWSAG,"I just have purchased an ""original"" work of art from my art dealer the artist, Sheldon Fink (Shelly). He died in 2002. One of the eleven artists photograhpted so long ago in the 1950's. They dared to be different. They were Realist artists. When Abstract Art was the new rage and the only thing worth looking at! Thank God, these young Artists had to save what at was considered  old fashioned at that time. Trees looked like trees and people like real people. In the near future there was plentry of room for both styles. Their struggle is worth reading. There is not many of these artists left now. I highly recommend this DVD  for all lovers of  Art of any style.",1369699200,,666,4.442622950819672
8478747,5,B005LXWSAG,"What a fascinating look at a group of serious young artists, many of whom became friends in high school in the 1940s, and who already were certain that they liked realism as their way of expression.  They were bucking a trend to modern art as a way of saying what they wanted to say, and an outstanding group of artists, mostly painters, but one cartoonist and one sculptor, became icons of the modern-day realist. Long may their works live!  Bravo as well to the producer for making this wonderful and informative film.",1321660800,,520,4.641304347826087
