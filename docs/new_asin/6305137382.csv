Since I used to babysit a lot, it really hit home.  I was afraid to go anywhere alone for  weeks.  The ending was one of the best and most supirising I have ever  seen!  Since this the movie is so hard to find in video stores, it makes it  even that much better to watch.  I give it two thumbs up!",949363200,2,429,3.895348837209302
974051,4,6305137382,"""When A Stranger Calls Back"" is the sequel to 1979's ""When A Stranger Calls"" featuring Carol Kane and Charles Durning reprising their roles. The beginning is almost exactly like the original's beginning.  The only difference is that things disappear, simple things like a piece of  paper or a pen, plus a continuous knocking at the door by a shadowy figure.  Jill Schoelen plays Julia, who keeps getting harrassed by phone calls and a  man outside her door. She becomes hysterical as the 2 kids she was  babysitting were kidnapped and murdered. 5 years later, she is attending  college when she gets harrased again, presumably by the same person who  bothered her before. Student advisor Jill Johnson (Carol Kane) tries to  help Julia any way she can, as she was similarly harrassed when she was a  teenager. She also enlists the help of retired detective John Clifford  (Charles Durning) to help find Julia's stalker. Thsi is film is more  suspenseful, more fast-paced with better performances than the original.  Carol Kane is great as Jill as well as Charles Durning. The only one thing  I noticed about this film is that it's sort of a sequel to the first 20  minutes of the original. There is no mention of the killer getting shot  instead he was put away and Jill doesn't have a husband or kids. Continuity  glitch I guess. This is a great film to own if you have the first one. Full  of suspense, buy it!",940636800,,1411,4.670731707317073

974376,3,6305137382,"When a Stranger Calls back was overall a well-done sequel that in some ways improves on the original, but in other ways it's also very inferior to the original. Like the original the opening act is simply brilliant. Each second the tension is raised until you are on the edge of your seat. While the opening act may not be as great as the original it is a very tense and edge of your seat thrill ride.

After the opening act in the original it does slow down and can be a little boring in some areas, but I still think its better than most people give it credit for. Here in When a Stranger Calls Back the middle sections aren't as slow paced, but the problem is it lacks the eerie feel of the original. For the first half of the movie you're still on that high from the opening act so even the slightest suspense scene will play out very well.

The one thing this movie does get right is I always felt the original should have been Jill Johnson's story with the stranger being more of a sub-plot. After the opening act instead of switching over to the stranger we stay with Julia played by the lovely Jill Schoelen who was tormented in the opening act. Returning is Carol Kane as Jill Johnson and Charles Durning as John Clifford; When a Stranger Calls back works well when the focus is on Julia, but works ever better when Jill is the main focus. This time around the stranger William Landis played by Gene Lythgow has a very small part and only appears a couple of times and mostly he's kept hidden.

Writer Fred Walton does a pretty good job with the screenplay, but there were some directions the movie could have gone. Jill appears around the 30-minute mark and in a main stay through the movie unlike the original where she only appears in the opening and closing act. While Walton does do a good job with the character I do feel a little more could have been done with her character. Overall the script is well written, but never reached its full potential.

As a director Fred Walton does an excellent job of creating suspense and tension. When it comes to opening acts I don't think you can find a better filmmaker. Once again he does such a great job with the opening act that the slightest little noise will freak you out. The pacing though after that does lack in some areas. As I stated before the middle sections aren't as slow this time around, but they aren't as creepy as the original. There were some problems in the 2nd half where the pacing does suffer. Despite When a Stranger Calls only running at about 93-minutes I do believe it could have lost a couple of minutes to help the pacing. The 2nd half isn't bad, but does sort of repeat itself at times.

Once again When a Stranger Calls Back is one of those sequels that improves on the original even if not as good. I liked the idea of the moving focusing more on Julia than the killer. It's an interesting character study seeing her nerves really shot and nobody really willing to believe someone is stalking her. I've always liked Jill Schoelen and she provides a solid performance. The best scenes are those with Carol Kane who once again is out-standing. Jill Johnson who should have been the main focus of the original has a much bigger role this time. Charles Durning who carried the original is great here, but reduced to pretty much doing the same thing as he did in the original film and it just doesn't work quite as well.

The final act was good, but lacked the suspense and tension of the opening act. While it does have some tense moments it could have worked a lot better, but I suppose overall it does deliver. The killer here isn't nearly as creepy as Roy Duncan, but overall he works well in a small role. Like I said When a Stranger Calls Back in some ways improves upon the original, but is also inferior. Towards the end the movie does trail off a little bit, but never really becomes boring; Overall a good sequel.",1199923200,3,3908,4.390883977900552
974417,5,6305137382,"I agree with the other posts here , this is a superior made for TV what a surprise and to have Carol Kane back is just fantastic !

This idea of a young girl alone in the house the phone is dead and then theres a knock on the door , and the voice behind the door wants to use the phone and then it starts to send chills thus the movie goes into a rollercaster throughout .

974418,5,6305137382,"I use to watch this when I was young and the beginning use to scare the bezeesis outta me. Recently I saw it on ebay, and saw that it's an out of print dvd so i bought it, and watched it which I hadnt in years, i use to watch it alot when I was young, but to me (when i was only a kid) it was scary certain parts of the film then the rest was boring, which this movie is anything but, just not for kids. It's actually scarier now for me because as an adult I can really appreciate how frightening this film is because it's realistic, and realistic movies are the scariest ones. The acting is oscar worthy, Carol Kane is great once again after being the victim in WHEN A STRANGER CALLS. I think this film is brilliant, especially the original idea of the killer/stalker having a talent that he uses to his advantage, being a ventriliguist and having other skills like slipping in and out of a house without being seen, his mind games, his sadistic games that he enjoys so much, the power that he feels over his victim, poor julia, stalked by this maniac and the police just laugh at her. Another thing, this actor who we never really see, has the sexiest voice I've ever heard, which is probably one of the main reasons he got the part, it's his voice that makes it scary but erotic at the same time, when he keeps saying their name, JILL...........JILL. COME ON OUT JULIA. At first he sounded innocent and normal when he tells julia of his car breaking down, and I love the events that followed, the writing on the paper being erased, the note missing, the door unlocked in the back. Everything was planned, although he did intend to kill her because the doctor and wife come home and interuptted his ""act"" or he knew they were coming home at 11:30pm and wanted to stalk her in the future and finish what he started. He obviously got off on people's suffering. Very good film. We never really find out but you know he killed the kids. Especially when he told the landlord that kids had died and he wanted to find the mother, almost like a confession. Very creepy, suspenseful film. There are no flaws, perfect movie as far as I'm concerned, perfect suspense, and the movie lets you decide and figure everything out.",1158969600,3,2215,4.365617433414044
974419,5,6305137382,"This superior made-for-TV movie opens with high school student Julia (Jill Schoelen) babysitting two children.  A knock at the door is the beginning of a night of unspeakable terror and murder.  Five years later, Julia is now a college student, still scarred by that night.  Someone, it seems, has been breaking into her apartment and trying to scare her.  The police think she's making it up, but college crisis counselor Jill (Carol Kane) believes her, and tries to find out who is after her, aided by her friend (Charles Durning).  Soon, Jill becomes the stalker's new target.

This movie is going to terrify you; I guarantee it, especially if you were once a teenage girl who babysat alone.  I've seen the movie several times over the years, and I still have to mute the sound and close my eyes when the tension is too much.  Credit for this thriller's success goes to director Fred Walton who also wrote the script.  You feel like you ARE Julia, all alone and scared senseless, and the creepiness never lets up.  Schoelen is convincing as the hapless teen and quirky Carol Kane is always fun to watch.  The movie delivers genuine thrills and you won't easily forget it.

974421,4,6305137382,"I liked this sequel better than the original, right off the bat. I will always remember this film for the first 20-25 minutes which really scared me the first time I saw it. It gave me the creeps, and always will if I don't watch it too often.

After that, the movie settles down, and the excitement leaves, but it still keeps you interested, picking back up again at the end with another suspense scene.

This is a ""scare"" movie - a sequel - that works although there are a few noticeable holes in the storyline. I liked the camera-work in here with the closeups of the door lock or the phone, the slowness of camera movement here and there to build suspense, etc. The ending, in which the killer blends into a wall, is very neat.

The main actors are interesting to watch and a big plus , for those concerned about this, is the lack of profanity, especially surprising with Charles Durning in the film. The ""R"" rating had to be for a couple of topless waitress scenes.

Jill Schoelen gets third billing and she's the star of the movie. Carol Kane, the star of the first film: When A Stranger Calls, helps out on this case, too, and it's nice to see her again.",1146700800,3,1161,4.336405529953917
974422,5,6305137382,"How do you top When A Stranger Calls? Well, you don't because that's absolutely impossible. How do you equal it? Come out with a sequel that's every bit as entertaining and suspenseful, but do it in different ways. many have said that again this movie like its' predecessor has a terriffic opening and ending with a slow going central piece. Others think the central piece is better here than in the original. I feel that When a Stranger Calls Back is a thrill ride all it's own that builds upon premises and themes that the original helped Hollywood capitalize on in numerous films after the original Stranger. As such a movie it can only do better than all those that followed the original stranger since stranger was the standard. In When a Stranger Calls Back we see a much hardened Jill played by Kane, now an advocate for women taking charge of themselves and not depending on dismissive men around them to keep them safe. while the transformation is a wonderful thing to see, you still feel the presence of the original scared girl that had us so riveted in the first movie. In comparison, our young heroine in ""Back"" that Kane's character Jill befriends never really manages to push the button of that nerve Kane so brilliantly did in the first movie, she only touches on it. Still, Back is an unending supply of suspense and mindplay that keeps you just as riveted as the original did. The climax is more reminiscent of the brilliant Wait Until Dark, but is just as intense as the original When a Stranger Calls. All in all, When a Stranger Calls Back is a must see thrill ride that is equally as great as the first, but has terror that is more distributed than concentrated.  5.5 stars",1134691200,9,1695,4.5756578947368425

The first movie started and ended with chills and thrills at the beginning and end but had a stagnant middle. This one is nonstop terror that will leave you clinging to your seat! The original cast is back, an especially nice touch, and some of the plot is the same, but is far from a rehash of the original.

The only complaint is that some loose ends are left untied...
Jill's husband and children, seen in the end of ""When a Stranger Calls"" aren't even mentioned. The children who disappeared while Julia was babysitting are never found and their fate is unresolved.

974424,5,6305137382,"The sequel to 1979's good-but-not-spectacular ""When A Stranger

Calls"" blows its predecessor out of the water in almost every way

imaginable, in my opinion.  The first 20 minutes or so of the film, which, like the original has a babysitter in the house(this time played by one of my personal favorites, Jill Schoelen)

receiving increasingly ominous telephone calls, could be called a remake of the (admittedly great) first 20 minutes of the last one, but from there the two movies veer off in different directions, this one taking a darker and far eerier path.  It's after the first 20 minutes that the film eases off the terror throttle a bit, both to get to know the characters better and to give the viewer a chance to breathe without having a heart attack.

  Carol Kane, the babysitter from the first film, along with Charles Durning, the lead detective from the first, return to help with the police investigation, due to their experience in a similar situation years before.  In my opinion, both give superior performances this time around, which along with the new cast members makes for one of the better ensembles of players out there.  And as for the villain of the show, what can be said of this character?  Not very much, for the antagonist remains a mystery until well into the final third.

  After the brief respite following the opening terror, ""When A Stranger Calls Back"" rises quickly and dramatically in fright and intensity, and some of the most chilling and disturbing visual imagery ever conceived of comes into play towards the end.

  A complete masterpiece, with intensity comparable (though not as much gore) to the first ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", the best ""Hellraiser""s, and the deranged ""House Of 1,000 Corpses"".",1096156800,45,1745,4.921232876712328

The first 30 minutes still very frightening and tense, but the rest of the flick wasn't just how I remenbered it...it gets a bit slow, but pretty good any how...this is a very low budget flick with a huge potential of freaking people out...give it a try...you won't regret it.",1072396800,7,582,4.398148148148148

974481,4,6305137382,"I saw this movie long ago when i was younger.  I was quite thrilled by it then and i still am now at the age of 18.  Ofcourse when i heard it was a sequel i was thrilled.  'Cause everyone says sequels aren't as good as their predecessors.  Anywhoo, i sought out When a Stranger Calls and was quite disappointed.  It was a good movie but When A Stranger Calls Back is far superior.  I think the long-lasting presence of Carol Kane was the redeeming factor of this movie.  It was quite entertaining and thrilling to see Kane's characters turn from the frightened girl in When a Stranger Calls to the independent and tough woman in When a Stranger Calls Back.
This is the type of movie that will have you feeling genuinely frightened and tense and you will cheer for the very woman empowering finale and showdown between Carol Kane and the killer.",1031184000,,844,4.441558441558442

It kept showing the door being locked. I was just waiting for her to look at it and find it unlocked. I thought the movie was very good in my opinion. But I think the first part where she is babysitting is the most suspenseful. I didn't care too much for the ending. It left you not knowing about the little kids, if they were ever found or not. But other than that I thought it was a very good movie.",1024617600,,570,3.9224137931034484
974484,3,6305137382,"As with the original, When a Stranger Calls Back follows a simple formula - Good Stuff, Boring Stuff, Good Stuff.  In an attempt to show they've learned from their mistakes the filmmakers decided to reduce the bad stuff by expanding the opening.  I think this one is about twice as long as the original.
Jill Schoelen is babysitting for the night.  There is a knock at the door and a small, inoffensive voice asks her to call AAA because his car is broken down.  When she tries, she finds there is no dial tone.  Of course you don't tell a stranger you're all alone with no phone so she tells him AAA is on their way.  She does everything right.  She doesn't open the door when he asks, she makes sure all doors and windows are locked, she doesn't give out her name.  It doesn't do her much good, though.  This opening sequence is every bit as good as the original and then some.  Schoelen is perfect as the put-upon babysitter trying not to be rude and scaring herself half to death with thoughts of what's on the other side of that door.
But...you have to enter the second act at some point and when WASCB does it sinks fast.  It's five years later and Schoelen now has an awful mullet that makes her look as unattractive as possible.  I guess that's the point, but geez -- a mullet?.  Carol Kane and Charles Durning are conveniently in the neighborhood to investigate.  Again, it picks up for the third act when Kane is stalked by this new killer.  His method of disguise is pretty ingenious, I have to admit.
The DVD has no extras and is not widescreen, so there is no real reason to get it if you already have it on VHS or have seen the Showtime version.
Again, recommended for the opening and ending, but nothing in between.",1020124800,,1730,4.3625
974485,4,6305137382,"This is the first movie review I have ever submitted here. After seeing, and being taken totally off guard by this movie -I had to write...
I tuned into this late one night while channel surfing on cable.  I missed the opening credits, so didn't know what it was, but I'm sure glad I didn't miss the beginning.  It had that look of a made-for-TV production, which really threw me off, but there was something about it that kept me from clicking the remote.  The opening scene where the typical innocent babysitter began to become terrorized, slowly grew to the point of almost being unbearable!  I'm a guy, and (sadly) am almost never scared watching a movie - but this one blew my mind.  The way the Director slowly took his time, and languished his craft carefully through every scene is what I believe sets this movie apart.  No sudden jump ups (untill the very last scene)trick edits, or trendy rock soundtrack.  In fact after the nerve-wracking beginning, the whole middle of the movie almost dwindles out to becomming boring - and I think that was intentional.  When the main female star of the movie is pushed almost out of the plot, and you're thinking ""well that's it"" it's almost over...LOOK OUT! This has to be one of the most effective scary movies ever made, and I'd never even heard about it before.  A must have for anyones collection.  If you live alone - prepare to have your poor innocent mind warped :)
They should put this one out in the theatres now (nine years after it was made for TV,no less) and I truely believe it would be a success on the level of ""The Sixth Sense"". Great Stuff. Hollywood, are you listening?  More movies like this please!",1015632000,3,1668,4.545150501672241
974543,5,6305137382,"I think this sequel was originally made for cable (I could be wrong) which is ironic because in many ways, it far surpasses the original.
Yes the opening 20 minutes are truly terrifying. I recently re-watched the original and it does have its moments but the opening in that one is VERY brief and after that, it totally falls to pieces. I could barely keep from falling asleep.
This one, however, has a more extended opening sequence filled with a lot more chills. Jill Schoelen has a lot more to do than Carol Kane did and she carries it off very very well.
Also, unlike the original, the film holds up fairly well after the opening shocks.  It's not perfect but it does continue the mystery and the mood and it leads to an equally frightening finish.
This is a fun movie to watch. You won't be disappointed. Buy it on sale or used and you'll be very glad he called back.",1003622400,2,872,4.382716049382716

974545,4,6305137382,"Omigosh! The first 20 minutes of this movie alone is worth the sale price. Pure, undiluted suspense and terror that director Fred Walton delivers with the deliberate pace and tempo of a seasoned maestro. Walton is, of course, the under-appreciated horror auteur who delivered the original When a Stranger Calls with unexpected panache. (He also made the revisionist slasher movie April Fool's Day a forerunner of the ironic post-modern horror hipness of Scream, Cherry Falls and the like.) When a Stranger Calls Back is more a remake than a sequel, despite the return of the now much older central characters of the first film. Walton has effectively done what pioneering silent horror director Roland West did when he remade his 1926 silent movie The Bat as a talkie in 1930 - use changing film conventions and the steady accumulation of genre experience to attempt to deliver a better mousetrap. Unlike West though, Walton actually succeeds in delivering a film that is better and scarier than the original. How on earth this truly scary horror film failed to get a wider cinematic release given the pervasiveness of rubbish like I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is beyond comprehension. There have hardly been better suspense movies than this, which stands proudly in the league of Black Christmas and the original Spiral Staircase. The schema of Walton's sequel is pretty much that of the original - a nailbiting opening sequence with a young woman menaced by a clearly deranged madman, followed by a middle devoted to uncovering the killer and finally another edge-of-your-seat last third. Carol Kane is superbly world weary as the survivor from the original who now works as a campus woman's counsellor. She becomes involved in supporting one of her students who five years before had survived a similar experience to hers (the riveting opening sequence). The student is being harassed by an anonymous psycho with clear knowledge of her earlier experience. Kane calls on assistance from the detective (played with familiar comfort by the returning Charles Durning) who had assisted her in catching the killer in the original. Together, the three piece together the apparent mystery of what actually happened on that terrifying night five years before. With plenty of good shocks along the way, it culminates - as we expect and want - with a truly original showdown against the backdrop (literally as you shall see!) of Kane's sparse art deco loft. When a Stranger Calls Back is one of those under-released, underrated gems that slowly build their way to cult, then classic, status. In this regard, it is - alongside The Changeling, Black Christmas, Manhunter, The Conqueror Worm etc. - in superb company. Highly recommended for suspense and horror afficionados.",989366400,7,2772,5.094505494505494

974547,4,6305137382,"The opening sequence of this movie, yet another variation on the ""When a Stranger Calls""/""Scream""/""Scream II"" yarn about the imperiled babysitter, does it better than any movie I've ever seen.  What distinguishes it is (1) the babysitter here is intelligent, mature, and kindhearted, and you identify with her moral quandary, and (2) for the longest time, you just don't know that the person she's dealing with isn't as innocent as she is.  It's the moral dilemma that draws you into the situation, and it's the realistic, could-easily-happen details that get under your skin.  The rest of the movie is good, though inevitably not as good, and it drops off a second time once the plot conveniently sideswipes the babysitter character so that Kane, who starred in the original, can take over.  But it still stays above the pack all the way through, and the ending is one of those that I hear people talk about even if they can't quite remember which movie it was from.",977097600,,967,4.807228915662651

Someone is watching Julia, toying with her like a cat and mouse.  Unlike the original ""Stranger"" this film continues the suspense throughout the entire film.
