8276006,2,B0009EIO2S,"This video might be of interest to some people but for me as a tourist, wanting to explore Namibia not just the birdlife, wildlife and sealife, there is definately a lack of exploration on general places and place of interest shown. There is so much more to Namibia than what was shown. Namibia is a First world and Third world country in one. It offers excellenct accommodation on game farms and Getaway Lodges. It has breath taking landscapes and this was not explored enough. I found the DVD of amateur quality.",1175385600,,514,4.65934065934066
8276007,3,B0009EIO2S,I have a daughter their in the Peace Corp.  Two of my sons are going there this summer.  The video was good as far as it went.  But there are more places that they could have talked about.  I expected more on Etosha Park and other parts of Namibia.,1168473600,,248,4.0
