666816,5,6303510051,"Sinbad has got to be the funniest comedian in the world, and he shows it in this video.  With jokes about everything from childhood to vampires, Sinbad never misses in this hilarious routine.  I convinced my brother to  rent this video (he had never really watched Sinbad) and he still talks  about it.  Sinbad is one of the few comedians who knows that humor can be  good, without being dirty or filled with foul language.  This is truly one  of the funniest stand-up routines I have ever seen.",956880000,8,495,4.545454545454546
666817,5,6303510051,"This video has become a family tradition. I believe we've seen it at least 12-15 times. In fact, even if you weren't raised in the 70's you'll laugh til' you have tears!",948844800,5,169,4.3125
7849103,5,6303510051,"Sinbad is hilarious in this video.  It is my all time favorite of all his comedy videos.  This video is best enjoyed in the company of good friends.  Get
ready for a round of belly laughs.",1470528000,,188,4.166666666666667
7849104,5,6303510051,This comedy VHS is Hillarious!! It played the entire show without any kinks.  This is the unedited version.,1427241600,,107,4.944444444444445
7849105,4,6303510051,I lost this video and found it again on Amazon.  So funny!  I would suggest reading it especially if you are from the 70's or not.,1359936000,,130,3.9615384615384617
7849106,5,6303510051,"I have watched this video at least 50 times and still find myself and all those I share it with doubling over with laughter. A must for anyone who was around in the 70's. Although from the first time my 17 year old son watched it with me,and the many times after, he is now 23, we find ourselves mimicing this stand up act a lot in our everyday lives. ""Roll the window down"", ""Sometimes you win, sometimes you dont"", ""You ain't lived till you had an 8 track"", Pee-pee Johnson? We thought he done peed himself to death"". Hilarious!!! If you love laughter, this video is for you.",1251158400,,577,4.302752293577981
7849107,5,6303510051,"I saw A&B on HBO live in '93 and I laughed so hard, it was the kind of laugh that doesn't have volume; it build up like a ballon although it's trying to get out, until finally it erupted in a massive wave of racket (so said my downstairs neighbors).  I LOVED IT. A TOTAL SCREAMER. Which is why I don't go to comedy clubs.  If it's funny, I'ma laugh so hard, I'll draw attention to myself so much so someone like Sinbad would have a field day with me.  Sinbad gives me hope in comedium in that you can be funny and not necessarily need to cuss, although I DO enjoy it as well.  Sinbad's a comic genius and what's more, he comes across as honest in his musings.  I have only one complaint: for God's sake, WHY AIN'T THIS ON DVD?!?  If there is a DVD, someone PLEASE tell me how I can buy a copy (NO BOOTLEGS!!)  If there isn't a DVD yet, I hope one will be created complete with sidebars from Sinbad.  He is SO, da man.",1143849600,2,917,4.0
7849108,5,6303510051,"Afros and bellbottoms was great! Sinbad had the whole family cracking up. It's nice to hear such great humor without the usual cuss words that so may comedians think is neccessary. Great job,Sinbad!!!!",1116201600,6,201,5.121212121212121
7849109,5,6303510051,Unlike alot of modern comedian's Sinbad's standup depended on quick whitted observations about his youth rather then pithy cynical remarks. And his timing is WONDERFUL!This video shouldn't be as rare as it is!,1107993600,8,209,5.363636363636363
7849110,5,6303510051,"A must for Sinbad fans of all ages! One of the few comics who come off just as good on tape as in person. After seeing his live show 2 days ago, my only mission is to acquire as many video performances as possible.",1067126400,7,214,3.8863636363636362
7849111,5,6303510051,"This is a great stand-up special and all, but the ""PG-13"" rating is misleading because there is no profanity in this video, unless of course you consider the word ""pimp"" to be a swear word.",1007856000,9,189,4.428571428571429
7849112,5,6303510051,"Sinbad is a comic genious. He is able to transcend barriers of all sorts  so that a person of any race or age would find him amusing. He is  brilliant! His humor is ""down to earth"", and he is always quick  with his witt. This video is hysterical. I laughed so hard I was actually  crying.",966816000,,288,4.089285714285714
