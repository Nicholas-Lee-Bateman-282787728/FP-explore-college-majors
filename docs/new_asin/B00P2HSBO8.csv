6785868,5,B00P2HSBO8,"I love this workout! It was the only that ever worked to me. I am happy to be able to work with it again. Thank Ms Jane Fonda to have it converted on DVD.  Sincerely, Celia Paula.",1420329600,3,179,3.8378378378378377
6785869,5,B00P2HSBO8,I Am SO glad this is being released in this format. It was the first and by far THE BEST! It kept me fit through four pregnancies and the postpartum after cesareans. I can't wait to use this on my 50 year old body now.  There has simply not been anything nearly as good,1419465600,97,269,3.9814814814814814
6785870,5,B00P2HSBO8,"I owned the VHS version in the 80s and worked out several times a week with this video.  It works all parts of your body, and isn't too long, so you can do it in 30-40 minutes, and you do not have to drive to the gym. I really noticed a difference in my body when I was working out with this video, and received many complements, so would definitely love to buy the DVD and start working out with it again.",1418947200,28,406,3.951219512195122
6785871,5,B00P2HSBO8,Thank you for making a DVD.  I used the VHS tape for years -  would great success.  Excellent workout.,1418860800,14,102,4.2631578947368425
6785872,4,B00P2HSBO8,"I remember liking this workout a lot when I first bought it in summer of 1982.  It didn't have any competition at the time and was considered quite the innovation in women's fitness, but it was a new idea for working out at home and great fun particularly if you were naturally flexible.  It was probably a bit hard if you weren't very flexible, though!  I took my tape with me to Saudi Arabia because I was working as a teacher there at the timeunfortunately, it was seized in customs because they were so sure it was pornography (note:  anything that showed female body parts in anything less than a black shapeless bag was considered suspicious, and Jane's cover outfit was seen as very salacious indeed).  The last I saw of my tape was in a side room at customs with a group of customs officials eagerly glued to the TV and watching the tape to ""review"" it for propriety.  I never got it back, by the way, so it's probably still in some customs official's video collection in the kingdom.  But it was a fun tape for sure, and when this comes out again I think I'll get the DVD version for fun.",1418688000,7,1097,4.348039215686274
6785873,4,B00P2HSBO8,I had this on VHS and found it refreshing. I hope she will release the Workout with Weights on DVD. That is my Christmas wish. I felt like a million bucks after working out with that tape.,1418688000,19,188,4.108108108108108
6785874,5,B00P2HSBO8,"This is the only workout I ever loved and worked for me. I enjoyed it sometimes I did it twice a day, but then my video wore out :(  I am sooo happy this is coming out on DVD and I hope now 20 plus years later I can get back in shape! Thanks Jane!",1418428800,40,247,3.4909090909090907
6785875,5,B00P2HSBO8,"The DVD is a great replacement of the VHS - The quality of the video is much much better than any other format it's been out on.  Looks and sounds great!  Great workout, my fave!",1418169600,,178,4.057142857142857
6785876,5,B00P2HSBO8,"Ok, this is vintage 80's, but I love this workout! I asked Ms. Fonda to release it to DVD when she was on the Rosie show a few years ago, in Chicago. I am thrilled it's being released to dvd, as my vhs copy has worn out! Great, classic workout that has kept me in great shape all these years!",1417651200,42,292,3.8833333333333333
6785877,1,B00P2HSBO8,Spare me.  This was crap the first time around.,1416787200,3,47,4.222222222222222
6785878,1,B00P2HSBO8,"DVD Audio didn't work, so we purchased another one. SAME THING. The intro audio with Jane Fonda worked well, but the audio of the actual exercise did not.  Both times. This has to be a defective batch, as I've read similar comments from others who purchased this DVD. So disappointed.",1524528000,,284,4.68
6785879,5,B00P2HSBO8,"Fantastic for anyone looking to shrink your waist, hips and thighs. I accompany this program with 30-45 minutes elliptical training 5x per week. My original goal was to restart a workout regimen and have my clothes fit comfortably. So far, Ive lost 7 pounds in one month and my clothes are starting to fit nicely. Ive not drank a drop of alcohol in a full month and I stop eating after 6pm. Im 45 years old and after many different styles of workouts, I especially like that Im not in agony the next day. Its an intelligent and realistically long term workout. Highly recommend!",1523491200,,578,4.5673076923076925
6785880,5,B00P2HSBO8,"I was a child when this came out on vhs, but I remember it being popular and mentioned in 80s sitcoms at the time. Jane always had a nice figure, imo, so I decided to buy this now that it's on DVD. I was surprised that she does not use weights and I was skeptical that this would even be effective. I also thought it would be easy so I decided to start with the advanced version. I was wrong! It was kind of fast paced and very repetitive and I really felt the burn now..3 days later from the waist exercises. I love the workout and I can see why it was a big hit. I look forward to buying her other ones.",1522540800,,605,3.8870967741935485
6785881,5,B00P2HSBO8,"So happy to see this great workout in DVD form. I exercised for many years to the VHS version and always wished it was available on DVD. I hate exercise videos that have you jumping all over the place, trying to learn complicated choreography/dance moves. There's none of that nonsense in this video. It's basic exercises that anyone could do and you WILL see results. It's the only exercise video that I consistently love doing, and the only one I've found that really whittles down the waist and hips and tones the legs. This will forever be my go-to exercise video because it works! There are actually two classes on this DVD: The Beginner Class and The Advanced Class. I recommend starting with the Beginner class, but if you consistently do this video 3-4 times a week, you'll be ready to move to the more challenging Advanced class in just a few weeks, if not sooner. Excellent workout!",1522108800,,892,4.651898734177215
6785882,5,B00P2HSBO8,I had purchased this on VHS many years ago and loved the workout.  I was very happy to see that it was remastered on DVD!,1521590400,,121,3.84

6785884,5,B00P2HSBO8,It was great 40 years ago and remains an excellent way to stay fit.,1520812800,,67,3.857142857142857
6785885,1,B00P2HSBO8,"Dvd has no sound. Jane Fondas mouth is moving, but you cannnot hear her voice to follow her directions. Worthless.",1517875200,,114,4.75
6785886,1,B00P2HSBO8,I bought this and it did not have any audio.  Imagine trying to exercise while not having someone telling you what to do.  It was awful. A total waste of money.,1517443200,,160,4.129032258064516
6785887,5,B00P2HSBO8,I purchased this and then found out that now I am too old for these exercises!!! But I still like having it as a collectable. I did the whole thing back in the day. Had the book.,1517184000,2,178,3.8378378378378377
6785888,5,B00P2HSBO8,"I'm so glad this workout is available again. I wore out my old cassette tape many years ago. By then I had the whole workout memorized anyway, and I still did it off and on again for years. Back in the day, it gave me courage to climb mountains, go on long bicycle tours, and join a gym and attend aerobics classes, lift weights, etc. I've often come back to it and done it from memory. Now it's still a great workout to do a couple times a week along with all the other things I do for fitness and fun.",1515110400,,503,3.99009900990099
6785889,2,B00P2HSBO8,"I wish this actually was the original one.  I wore out my VSH tape--it was very good and I  was delighted to think I could get it on a DVD.  This seems too fast paced (although the original one was too), the sound of her talking over the exercises isn't good ...I can barely understand it but perhaps that's because of my huffing and puffing.  Although some of the excersies are the same, this left out some of the very effective ones for me.  It was probably made about the same time as you can tell from the hair styles, but the people are different from the tape I had.  All in all, I am quite disappointed in it.  I will keep it but not use it 3 times weekly as before.",1515110400,,673,4.053030303030303
6785890,2,B00P2HSBO8,"I so wish this was Jane Fonda Ultimate Workout Challenge! It's too fast, jerky and has a lot of potential for injury, imo.  Also the hooting and hollering is really annoying.  It's a trend maker, ahead of it's time - but it's half as good as the workout she made a few years later!",1514505600,,281,4.185185185185185
6785891,1,B00P2HSBO8,"I  was very disappointed with his DVD.  It was listed and entitled as the ""Original Jane Fonda Workout"", but it wasn't.  I had the original workout on VHS and this one is nothing like it.  I returned it for a refund.  If you are wanting the true original, don't buy this one.",1513555200,2,275,4.211538461538462
6785892,5,B00P2HSBO8,"This is the original.  This is my ""third"" copy of this.  Started doing this workout back when it first came out.  I can now do it just by the out-dated music and don't have to watch the video.  Works out all your muscles, especially legs, stomach and behind.",1512777600,,258,4.3125
6785893,5,B00P2HSBO8,"Simply the best! So refreshing to get a straight-ahead approach with healthy results. No additional equipment required (which I love) and they really get you moving, and feeling inspired.",1512432000,,187,5.482758620689655
6785894,5,B00P2HSBO8,This workout worked for me in the past and is working for me again. There's no change in the new format which shows it works.,1511136000,,125,4.04

6785897,4,B00P2HSBO8,"I have been doing this workout alternated with other workouts for approximately 34 years.  I had a cassette for my first viewing and have had two of this same workout on DVD since then and I must admit that this is the only workout that does warm-up, full body conditioning and cool down.  I can snap back into fairly good shape in about a week if I have slacked off for a few weeks we sometimes do.  As I am ""maturing"" I find that I am still able to comfortably complete the Basic Workout and will probably continue using it as long as I am physically able.",1510617600,,558,4.196261682242991

6785909,5,B00P2HSBO8,"This was a wonderful Workout.  I am 80 years old and have always been active.  I purchased this to have something to do with my 7 year old niece. I I did have to stop once in a while as I have been out of shape but my niece went through it like a breeze.  I am sure, with a little practice, I will catch up to her.  We love it.  When she comes to visit, she always asks me to do it with her.  It is a great incentive.",1504051200,5,417,3.577777777777778
6785910,5,B00P2HSBO8,"I remember doing aerobics here and there during gym class in high school. I always looked forward to it more so than the usual competitive sports that I was not into.

20 years and 2 children later, I had gotten out of shape and was tired and overweight. I started working on my health by changing my eating habits and working out. I did Leslie Sansone in the beginning because I didn't feel fit or coordinated enough for more strenuous videos. I moved on to Beachbody Slim in 6, Denise Austin, Jillian Michaels, etc. While they all worked to help get the extra pounds off and get me stronger and healthier they were missing two elements that I really needed to continue:
1)stretching
2)FUN!

Slim in 6 did have a decent stretch included, but it's boring. Denise Austin's workouts are fun, but she can be so random that I often felt like I wasn't getting a decent workout.  Jillian is efficient at getting you in shape, but so is enlisting in the military.

Enter Jane. I'm pretty sure we did some of Jane Fonda's workouts because I vaguely remember the leotards, music, and moves but I don't know which one(s).

After looking on YouTube, I purchased a few of Jane's workouts on Amazon instant video because I didn't feel like waiting for delivery.

They're everything I was missing in my workout routine. They're efficient at working your entire body, there's sufficient stretching in between the moves to keep your muscles from getting stiff and sore, but possibly most importantly THEY'RE FUN! I love doing them every day. I look forward to doing them. There's no dread factor except for me to choose which one I want to do that day.

This original workout only has about 5 minutes of aerobics in each workout(beginner and advanced), the rest is toning and stretching. I usually do the advanced workout and feel great afterwards. If I want to do more cardio, I always still have enough energy to do so before or after the workout because it's not draining.

My current two favorites of Jane's workout are this one and the New Workout which is similar but has about 20 minutes of aerobics instead of the 5 with this one.

I don't often leave reviews, but had to for Jane's workouts. I just love them. <3",1503273600,4,2205,4.590330788804072

If you can read lips well and are experienced in aerobic workouts, you might do OK with this DVD.  Otherwise, choose something else.  Also, it is from before the time that it was determined that small movements with strong muscle control were more effective and better for you than the full swinging movements (like with leg lifts, etc.).  Since I took 3 years of aerobics classes in the mid 80's I think I can modify this DVD  to suit my needs, but it certainly is not what I was hoping for.",1480896000,,633,4.469565217391304

Doesn't really matter to me though...this was like riding a bike after 20 years for me..it IS the same workout and I never had anything to look at before, so just her voice is enough for me.  If you are like me and looking to replace the album..this is it!  If you are new to video workouts, i still recommend this.

It's a great video, but it seems the movements are fast and jerky (probably the 80s trend) compared to the ones I've done.  I would say this is a workout for someone in fairly good shape that just wants to keep in shape (this is NOT for getting in shape, not for a beginner or body-area-targeter).  I'll hold on to it for that reason...I'm not far from it.  But right now I need something that'll really do it, like the COMPLETE Workout.",1458259200,,519,4.255102040816326
6786020,5,B00P2HSBO8,"I love this workout very much. I do it 3 times a week even though I probably should do it at least 5 times a week but I walk at the park those 2 days in between to change up my routine. I started doing this when I was 21 but wasn't consistent with it like I am now at 25. When I went away to college I took it with me and did it whenever I could and was pretty consistent with it last summer until my fall classes started up again. Now that I have graduated from college I do have more time to be consistent with this dvd again. I've always had trouble losing weight because I don't have the best diet but it's not a horrible diet either. I have lost over 20 pounds and beat being almost diabetic from working out at the gym and doing spin classes but I didn't have much time to go to the gym when I was in school so I thought work out dvds were more convenient and cheaper for me and more effective because my whole body feels worked out with this dvd. I've maintained my weight loss for 5 years now and I feel like 2 months into doing this workout every week that my butt, thighs, and legs are finally starting to get toned and my gut looks like it's getting smaller. Some people see results faster than others and it really just depends on your body type and how often you're working out. I do like how the different segments are equally distributed and Jane has many repetitions which makes you feel the burn so much more. I also like how she has a small class and the cast is very colorful and the set is very inviting which makes you feel like you're physically there with everyone in 1982 lol.  For me, the leg segment is pretty grueling; no matter how many times I do it I always get tired and definitely feel that burn in my hips which is good. The abdominal segment can also be a little tedious. Overall, the dvd is pretty complex but with time you just get used to it even though the minor pain and burning never goes away. I always do the advanced workout and try to only do the beginner workout if I'm feeling sick or not in the mood to do a fully, complex workout which rarely happens. I've recently started alternating this 1982 workout every other week with her New Workout from 1985 which isn't as good as this one but still is effective. I don't care how old a workout video or dvd is as long as it's still effective.",1458086400,8,2335,4.109409190371991

Today's workouts are disingenuous - you feel like you are just working out absently with mindless jocks. Newer workouts seem UN-FUN;  they don't have proper foundation or warmup; and they have no rhythm. They tell some lame jokes and pretend to be having fun. I couldn't afford Jane's original workout until now. Jane's original workout is the best -THE BEST WORKOUT EVER. Jane's moves are effective and although the workout is challenging and the time well packed with lots of moves, Jane explains the moves, adds great workout music to the background and she encourages you in with such genuine spirit that you know you can  achieve your goals. I was never in better shape than when I used this workout before, and I used it for more than ten years. I'm going for round two, now, Jane. I look forward to challenging myself just as I did 20 or so years ago. Love it, appreciate the BALANCE in the workout sound, feel, exertion and FUN, and I know Jane will be right there encouraging me to do my best.",1455580800,13,1092,4.566326530612245

A well-spent 30 minute workout. You will feel like jello for a few days afterward, but it's so worth it. You're working out muscles you probably never knew existed. I've done many aerobics workouts over the years and this still holds up as one of the BEST ever. Some of the exercises in here strike me as being ahead of their time. Just don't do the cardio bit without proper running sneakers now (probably 2-3 mins tops)-the rest of the workout can be done with bare feet/socks.

6786128,5,B00P2HSBO8,"I see a lot of confusion in the comments and they all stem from either the use of a misleading cover image (they used the one from her hardcover book, with the red and black outfit) or from a lot of people with fuzzy memories.

Let's just get this straight.  The image above is from the workout book, which preceded the video, but it is not what she is wearing in the video. However if you view the back side, above, you will see several pictures of the actual video, with Jane in the lavender and purple outfit. To ease the confusion I am using the outfits as a quick visual reference point. In fact, she never ever wore the red and black outfit above in ANY of her videos.

Also, on this video, which contains the 30 and 60-minute workouts, the music is instrumental and kind of jazzy. There are no vocals so if you are expecting that, you're either thinking of the record she released for folks without VCRs yet (because frankly they weren't a given in households yet) OR you are thinking of the follow up to this, ""Jane Fonda's New Workout"", with a longer aerobics section and where Leslie Lillien lip syncs to a really cheesy song at the same time.

This workout was released in 1982, and no other videos came before it, period. She is barefoot and the only cardio to speak of is a brief moment where they jog in place, etc (yes, barefoot) to get the blood flowing. In 1982, ""aerobics"" wasn't really a thing in and of itself yet. This workout has been maligned for being unsafe, and I suppose it's true because of the bouncing stretches and speed of some of the movements, but if you listen to your body and don't flail your legs around you should be safe.  But it's a high-energy class that goes through some great floorwork and is loaded with classic 80s cheese while still getting that lactic acid burn going right where you want it.

So before you buy, please make sure to view the BACK of the case, shown above, because that IS the original workout and it's what you'll get. There are some short clips of it on tube of the you as well so you can make sure it's the one you want.

If, however, you are looking for the one with the longer aerobics section (hint; they are all wearing shoes and Jane wears a snazzy blue outfit), then you want her follow up to this, Jane Fonda's New Workout, which is also available here.

I don't see the Workout Challenge on here in streaming or DVD form but hopefully they'll get around to releasing that one too, because it's probably the toughest workout you'll ever do in your life (90 minutes from start to finish).

So to clarify...this is the first video she ever released, she's wearing purple stripes (NOT the red and black pictured above), the music is instrumental and jazzy and it's a fun workout if you use some common sense and adapt to your own body.",1434758400,31,2807,4.382692307692308
6786129,3,B00P2HSBO8,"This arrived OK, well packed and on time, so can't fault Amazon on this, but this is NOT the original black and red leotard workout - the one that starts ""Are you ready to workout?  You should have your running shoes on...""  So if you think that is what you are ordering, you are not.  This is the two tone pink leotard workout with the canned sounding dance band music that was apparently released in '82, instead of the one that came out earlier, I had no VCR, but I had the record and cassette.  I prefer the music on the other workout, it contains actual songs that play in the background as you workout, and it changes with the changes in exercise so you have the audio cue to the change, also I think the instructions given during the workout are better on the earlier one.  On this DVD, the background music dominates.  It is stage band stuff - blaring trombones - and swamps the instructions that Jane is giving - and it has far fewer instructions to keep you on track, I long ago lost the record but I still have a cassette tape, re-recorded many times.  I was so delighted when I saw this, and am now very disappointed.  Back to the cassette.",1434758400,,1152,4.300925925925926

I have exercised with younger Jane in the beginners 30 minute video about 4 times now and am familiar with the moves. Both videos are extremely similar; the advanced one hour video has the same routines but longer versions with some extra exercises in the abdominal set. Some of the moves, especially in the advanced video, suggest some grandstanding on Jane's part. I doubt that, today, anyone would be expected to spread their legs to such extremes or do a high shoulder stand, dropping their knees to their shoulders--well, you get the picture. All in all, though, this DVD is a great workout, and very entertaining.

6786231,4,B00P2HSBO8,"I first did this workout in 1983!  I own both this DVD and ""Jane Fonda's New Workout,"" and if I was going to buy just one I would go with the New Workout.  Here's why:
1.  The original workout doesn't have very good aerobics.  The aerobics last just a few minutes -- not long enough to get my heart rate up. The New Workout has about 12 minutes of aerobics in the beginner section and about 18 in the advanced -- much better.
2.  The original workout has these dorky arm exercises. Basically you stand in one place and move your arms. The New workout combines the arms and aerobics which feels very natural and is a better use of workout time.
3.  In the original workout, I wonder about the safety of several of the stomach and leg exercises -- whether they could cause injury. The advanced stomach exercises especially seem like they might put quite a bit of strain on the back. I think Jane and her advisors realized this and corrected the problem in the New workout. The New workout has a bit more instruction on proper form and the exercises just seem safer.

Though the original workout is OK, I must say that Jane Fonda's ""New Workout"" is the best workout I've ever done in 30 years. It's very complete. And I love it because you don't need to be a professional dancer to figure out the aerobics, like you do with many other exercise routines. Anyone can easily follow along. I usually do the beginner aerobics then switch to the advanced floor work. I had it in VHS for 20 years and was so excited to get it in DVD. Definitely worth buying.",1424131200,6,1548,4.354166666666667

If you lived through the 80's, the music and outfits will make you laugh (kind of like vintage SNL episodes, especially with her backup exercisers).  The two workouts (beginners and advanced) are decent, and cover a lot of areas.  Seems more like a toning and light cardio workout; it's not intense at all.

I have gone through super in-shape phases to, well, blub - which is where I am at now.  When I saw this on DVD I snatched it up and am starting back on the road to health.  I used to do this NO PROBLEM!  Well, 20+ years later it kicked my ass and left me ""resting"" on the floor a few times.  OK, this is totally 80's and the outfits are a scream - especially the guys who look like John Travolta wanna-be's!  But there's no denying IT WORKS!  I have as many workout dvds as Amazon - some better than others.  Some (sorry Bob Harper) are more for those in Olympic shape even though they say for ""beginners"".  I've found that the dvd is only as good as the number of times you exercise to it.  If it's so difficult you feel crappy about yourself - then it's a fail.  THIS IS NOT A FAIL!

I could not replace it at the time, they didn't sell it anymore so I just moved on to other things.  But I always missed it.  It is my FAVORITE workout of all time.  It really helped me to stay fit.  It is a nice combination of stretching and toning exercises mixed in with some aerobics.  It keeps my attention and it keeps moving from muscle group to muscle group so time passes quickly and I don't get bored.  It actually lasts about a half an hour which is great, so many videos are just too long. Now starting again at age 45 after kids it isn't as easy, I know my core is weak and I am not as fit.  But after three times I can already feel it is working.  I was a little sore but not unreasonably so.  I would highly recommend.  I hope this helped!",1422057600,6,888,3.8722222222222222

Considering I am older now I still can do the beginners workout with modifications since the body isn't a flexible any longer. Some of the things she does are out-dated like some of the stretches, only 5 minutes of aerobics in bare feet no less, and the cool down section is a yoga pose I never could do back then, let alone now. I haven't attempted the advanced yet, but it is basically has the same aerobic and resistance exercises but more of them and more intense than the beginners.
This is recommended for someone who is in some type of shape, otherwise you are going to be very sore for the next few days. It was fun to see Jane again, much younger and oh so flexible. But weren't we all years ago.",1421884800,4,870,4.2727272727272725

This is THE BEST workout for women, hands down.  There isn't a DVD today that can do any better. I've had all of them, and the boredom sets in quickly.  With Ms. Fonda's workout, I never got bored.
I am looking forward to doing the workouts again at 60.  I still have the VHS tape, but no player.  So I was really happy to hear it was being released on DVD.

The video quality is a marked improvement even over the LaserDisc, which up until the DVD release was probably the best quality print of the Workout.  Those who may recall the RCA videodiscs from the 80s may remember this Workout on that format, and how you could listen to either the music and Jane's voice or just the music when using the audio selector on the stereo player models.  While this disc is technically not dual-audio with a music-only option, if you are able to isolate the audio to just listen to the right audio track, you could, indeed, have the Workout with music-only.  Maybe a minor plus for some, but for fans of this program I think it's a nice feature if your DVD/TV allows for audio separation or if your computer video player can play one side track (I use VLC player on my Mac). The Easy Going (Prime Time) DVD also works similarly - the other 3 have stereo sound but not one designated music-only side.

The menu breaks the workout down by class and has an introduction from Jane on the popularity and demand for this and the other recently released videos.  Each class has chapter breakdowns so that you are able to access or jump forward by segment, as well.

This is definitely an excellent purchase for any JFW fans of old or new - the quality and presentation are impressive and will definitely help you ""go for the burn"" for years to come.",1420588800,20,1443,4.505747126436781
