8202819,3,B000RWE2GO,terrible overall movie but the story was good,1434326400,,45,4.75
8202820,2,B000RWE2GO,"The film consists of a group of self proclaimed nerds fighting poorly made-up ninja zombies. Ancient curse, sword, etc. The film is meant to be funny and cheesy, but falls way short of anything. Its attempt to be a cult classic has likewise flopped. Death metal music is played during the fight sequences, which appear to have zero choreography, and are made exciting by said music and jerking the camera around while splashing blood on the camera lens. Dialogue was poorly written.

Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Sexually suggestive insults.",1431129600,,547,5.010989010989011
