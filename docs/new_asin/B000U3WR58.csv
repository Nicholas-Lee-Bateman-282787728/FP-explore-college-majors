Sexier in suits than the velvet jacket and tee. Also the lighting is not good, their was a lot of glare on my T V
Screen. The camera work is not good either! I wanted to see more of Cliff,  not the dancers who up- staged
Him at times. But if your a Cliff fan like me you will want this dvd.",1391817600,,398,3.738095238095238
8212077,5,B000U3WR58,"I wanted to see Cliff after all these years, and I was so lucky to get this disc from a small store in Hong Kong. Cliff's still slim and handsome, despite the slight hunch and tram lines. And what a performance!!! Fans, get this DVD however you could! It's a gem to be treasured and played again and again!",1198108800,,306,4.203389830508475
